Not me. I’ve been following the scalability problem pretty closely. There are a lot of possible solutions to be explored, and some of them look very promising. Zilliqa is just one of them. OmiseGo has plasma working. Ethereum is looking to transition to proof of stake and use sharding. 
The amount of innovation is amazing.

There’s a lot of resistance at 6500. That was the so called double bottom.

It does seem like FUD is exceptionally well timed. What stopped the bull was FUD about the SEC ruling whether Ether is a security. Total FUD. Exaggerated and well timed.

Looks nothing alike. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:11:59
The rich are buying bitcoin on secret exchanges that prevents their demand from pushing up prices because their buying is not reflected on public exchanges. 
Their selling, however, occurs on public exchanges, thus pushing the price down. Timed to correspond with gox dumps, the rich can accumulate as much as they want, make their short sales pay off, etc.

This is not like the stock market where stocks go up and stocks go down, and values increase over long periods of time. We are are the beginning of a sociocultural revolution in the way money and business is done. The decentralized Amazons and Facebooks are being created right now. 
So yes, at some point bitcoin will cross 10k and never return. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 16:15:29
The math is wrong. Bitcoin was 115 back in May, 2013. That was about 8.7 bitcoin then. That’s about 70,000$ today. That’s a 70x gain. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 01:11:02
6500 was supposed to be the double bottom. If 6500 breaks who knows where the bottom is. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:44:48
Get an iPad. Install only crypto apps. Use it only for trading. Keep the iPad powered off when not used to trade, which is probably 95 percent of the time. 
This way, you have a device large enough to see websites like Binance and inexpensive enough that you can buy it and have it sitting around powered off. Your crypto is much more valuable than your iPad. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 17:39:26
There’s just huge support at 6500...can’t see that breaking. The pattern in crypto is 1000 percent gain and 50 to 70 percent loss. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:58:52
Lost supply is already priced in. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:27:24
A lot of people believe the markets are manipulated. Whales selling to push prices down and accumulate. I think that’s hard to do at a single exchange, where ones own buying and selling might exert equal pressure up and down. The question then arises how to best manipulate price.I simply proposed a mechanism by which that could happen. Well timed FUD is another mechanism. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:33:49
 Zilliqa was created to solve the scaling problem using sharding and proof of work. Seems like a great solution. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 14:49:28

@_date: 2018-05-27 02:01:48
If u look at the daily graph, it show the price falling off a cliff...looks completely unnatural, bot created. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 23:06:57
So...it’s taken six months to read 8k users and it had 9k and then lost 1k?  Not encouraging. 
And I’m no fan of BCH either 
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:05:58
My understanding is that sharding divides the total number of nodes into subsets. Rather than requiring consensus from all nodes, only those in the subset are required to reach consensus. this dramatically reduces the amount of work the network has to do. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 10:10:49
I guess I’m inclined to say that there may be further innovations, like sharding, that could speed up BCH. Zilliqa is using proof of work and sharding, and they say their network scales indefinitely. I don’t know whether that could be brought to BCH. However, I’m not willing to say it’s game over for later 1 solutions. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:04:22
There have been other bear markets...the overall direction is up...the bear doesn’t unwind completely. Maybe it unwinds 70 to 90 percent from its all time high. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 21:49:03
Keep laughing. ;)
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:21:34
What I was saying is that sharding could be one way to speed up BCH. There could be other ways. I’m honestly not interested in the specifics of sharding. My only point is that BCH is necessary in order to understand how far a layer 1 only solution can go. That becomes an important baseline to which BTC can be compared. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 23:20:55
LN only has about 8k nodes after six months. I wouldn’t be bragging much about LN
@_date: 2018-06-21 00:06:24
I hope it works out with LN. we need LN too...there’s no way to know what it’s unique advantages might be until someone builds it. however, BCH could do more than just increase block size...they could adopt sharding. Zilliqa uses subsets of 600 nodes and they are saying the network scales indefinitely. But I honestly have no idea what it would take to make this work with BCH. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:15:31
Okay...what I was saying is that innovations may be found that could increase speed without requiring a layer 2 solution, perhaps sharding. Are you saying that sharding and BCH don’t get along for some reason? 
@_date: 2018-06-12 12:24:06
BTC would need to become a real currency, which means convenient ways to store, retrieve, spend, and secure. Until that happens, the public won’t won’t adopt btc to replace fiat. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 23:54:14
I find this disappointing, though I certainly would rather not rush things and have something half baked. 
I do think it’s important to have a version of bitcoin that tries to achieve all its goals without a layer 2. It provides a baseline against which to evaluate the trade off between complexity and functionality. BTC May achieve more speed with its LN but what is the cost in code complexity? Since it’s still in beta, apparently the cost is high. Perhaps BCH finds a way to increase speed to 80 percent the speed of LN without a layer 2 solution. At that point BCH starts looking good because of simplicity. 
Who knows what will really happen, of course. But we need BCH as a baseline against which to judge the success of BTC. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:41:56
I’m aware that complete decentralization is intended to maximize security. You have a position about sharding and it’s not a position that everyone agrees with apparently, and I doubt that we are going to settle that here. If you want to bring up the trilemma of security, decentralization, and transaction speed as context, it’s okay with me... both BCH and BTC attempt to maximize decentralization and security while sacrificing speed, because both inherited from the same codebase. I doubt that a LN can speed things up without a sacrifice somewhere. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 09:30:04
I’m talking about the trade off between code complexity and functionality, not the user experience. If BCH can someday do 80 percent the speed of LN with 1/3 the code that’s important as a baseline of what a layer 1 only solution can achieve. 
Having said that, I have no idea how things will end up, since new ideas are being proposed all the time. Maybe LN is complex but can be perfected. Maybe BCH actually succeeds and BTC looks bloated by comparison. No way to know. What I do know is that we need both so that we can better understand the best solution. 
I recognize this may not be a popular answer since the BTC vs BCH war is so polarized.  But competition is good and users win here...eventually. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:53:26
What is the primary barrier to nodes being able to validate blocks? Do you think miners are going to push the envelope so much the network fails?
I did scan your article, But i don’t consider necessary to read it in detail, because it’s not my main point. 
You apparently believe it’s possible for layer 2 to add features to the network without any sacrifice. I certainly hope u r correct. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 13:57:19
Exactly. If it had been making small gains since last year without ever going to 20k we’d all be celebrating. The hyperbolic 20k thing distorts peoples judgment. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 14:05:33
Every peak has made the last one look like a molehill. You just have to HODL. Otherwise, there’s no reason to be in crypto. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 09:51:38

@_date: 2018-06-15 11:40:22
And does it then issue an order to rebuy when the price begins to rise above the stop loss again?

Every day brings us closer to institutional money. It’s already happening with coinbase now offering its custody solution. Minimum investment 10 million USD. Things are looking very very good for crypto. 
What’s hurting us is that a lot of people still have a hangover from buying near the all time high. They feel burned.
But as big money arrives, prices will go up. And those hangovers will subside. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 00:28:44
The point is that each successive pump makes the previous peak look like a bump
@_date: 2018-07-14 10:25:13
Bitcoin is already global. The question is whether it will be a currency. The lightning network solves this problem. So yes, it will be a global currency. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 10:12:12
Buy low, sell high. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 00:02:18

@_date: 2018-07-25 09:42:12
The fundamentals are way way more solid than when bitcoin was at its all time high. Even if the ETF currently being considered isn’t approved this time, some ETF eventually will be. Gateways for institutional money are opening. 
Things have actually never been this good. Ever. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 01:23:24
What it really means is that the crypto space is kind of insular and that new money is not coming into the space yet. The possibility of a bitcoin etf is good news and people are therefore dumping alts for bitcoin. 
At some point new money will start coming into the space and bitcoin dominance will start falling again 
@_date: 2018-07-12 12:15:18
I am not sure whether the amount of debt is a joke either. I do know that debt is headed upward. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 02:07:54
The realization that there r more ETFs in the pipeline and that the SEC chief supports an ETF...that it’s inevitable now...that the fundamentals of btc are far better now than when btc was 20000...  it’s unreal how much the space has advanced. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 11:59:57
This is how we get from a fiat to crypto world: no one wants to pay all that debt. The debt causes an economic apocalypse. So society switches to crypto. The dollar, mark, yen, pound etc all go to zero. Then nation states can pay off their debts because zero x 247 trillion is zero. 
Maybe Nation states are the enemy for getting us here. Hmmmm....

@_date: 2018-04-16 00:33:17
Unless you get in early enough, yah. And we all know that the rich already own the media and large corporations. In my opinion it was a master stroke by the rich to get bitcoin options approved on CBOE so they could stop the bull run with their short sells...they followed that up with bans on crypto ads by google, Facebook, and twitter in order to prevent demand from resurfacing 
@_date: 2018-07-08 02:40:51
There’s more good news coming. Much more. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 10:55:52
With the lightning network bitcoin finally emerges as a currency. At that point huge demand is stimulated. It ceases being an asset subject to capital gains, and I think it gains the ability to execute some smart contracts in the lightning network...
Just needs a little more time to mature. The future is hugely bullish. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:19:12

The dollar isn’t a fuel either. As i said, it’s human beings that are interested in the drug trade. The headline says bitcoin does something...it fuels... but it cannot do this, so the analogy breaks down. It awards to bitcoin what it cannot do because all instruments are passive until an agent uses them.

There are lots of cryptographers in the world. Can you source something that establishes these as best and then presents their consensus that other alts are crap, or not?
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:05:47
But that doesn’t make bitcoin responsible for the drug trade. If it wasn’t bitcoin it would be fiat. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:00:29
I doubt very much that anyone trafficking in drugs wants their transactions recorded forever on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:26:44
I wish I could give you a longer reply...you keep trying over and over again...but there’s not much more to the argument than “is bitcoin a fuel?” You would like it to be, and you are struggling to advance arguments that it is. But bitcoin is not used up when it is transacted. It cannot fuel anything. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:04:28
They need you to believe this FUD for that to be true. Because then people stop buying and demand falls. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:01:46

@_date: 2018-04-12 20:56:38
More likely the start of a new bull market. I say that because the rise was the result of a classic short squeeze. Bitcoin rose, forcing short traders to buy at a higher price to cover their positions. 
In short, the bears who shorted btc...forcing the price down with their short sells...got their noses bloodied today. 
They won’t want to be caught like that again. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:38:28
