Value is subjective by definition. Intrinsic value (of a currency) is a term that, confusingly, is used by some Austrians to refer to the existence of non-monetary uses for that currency item. 
A better term would be *non-exchange value*. Gold has a lot of non-exchange value since it is also valued for reasons other than because it lets you buy just about anything, and so does Bitcoin: besides the niche geek appeal, it also is valued as an investment on the prospect that it will - in the future - let you buy just about anything.

To answer the objection definitively requires explaining why money is just a form of memory (or a low-tech way of recording who gave value to whom).
A simpler answer is that the whole idea of "backing" only came about because governments would inflate their currencies without end, hence you need some hard backstop to prevent this. With Bitcoin, it's issued in a hard schedule by design. Any portion of the network that deviates from that schedule is no longer using Bitcoin, by definition. Since there's no central issuer and no central control of any kind, you never have to trust anyone and you therefore never have to worry about placing a backstop on how much they can screw you over.

It's all about how people see it. 
In the early stages, Bitcoin proponents were faced with a tremendous uphill battle in trying to convince people it had value, hence Bit**coin**, digital **currency**, "be your own **bank**"; now the argument is largely won and there is no need to hobble ourselves by playing up Bitcoin as "money" anymore.

Can't you [base the initial Storjcoin distribution off the Bitcoin ledger]( 
I see no reason not to do this, other than "devs need funding." Doing it based on Bitcoin's ledger will still lead to huge funding if the project shows promise, as long as the devs - who are best positioned to know the future developments - simply invest a bit while others sell off their free storjcoins. Doing it as a premine risks someone forking the project, as explained in the link above.

If combating spam, vote brigading, and hype results in a complete lack of submissions about altcoins reaching the front page, you know you're doing something wrong. Altcoins are part of the environment in which Bitcoin resides and sometimes knowledge of the state of altcoins is crucial to fully contextualize Bitcoin-related news, hence at least *some* level of discussion on them is expected, natural, and warranted. If we get zero, we know know there's heavyhanded modding going on, to the readers' loss.

Ripple Labs' system is not technically a scam. It's just the most sophisticated and elaborate attempt so far to get people to buy into a ridiculous premine. In this case they bought out some other guy's interesting technology and tacked it on to their XRP coin, as well as cutely calling their coin a "worthless chit" or "postage stamp for spam prevention." Naturally, the coins took on a value and they got rich. Now the gig seems to be winding down and some of the founders appear to be cashing out.

Late reply, but I think the idea is that the network Mycelium *enables* is decentralized. Like how the word "Bitcoin" is used at times to describe both the software and the economic network it enables, there may be a tendency to include the ad hoc network Mycelium powers under the same label. For clarity these should really be called the Bitcoin and Mycelium ecosystems or networks, but everyday usage will probably not be that precise.

It's useful only for those who already put some nonzero probability on the 10x per year exponential trend continuing. It helps with visualization in that case. 
I don't think it was intended to make any claims about valuation without the assumption that the average of 10x per year trend will hold.
It's basically, "Here's a trendline I know a lot of you put some credence in. With that trendline in mind and with that assumption, here are some easy visualizations of credibly overbought and underbought states."

Not consumers, holders. 
At this time, merchant adoption is primarily just a steam valve for holders to rebalance their portfolios as the price rises, instead of what they would usually do: sell on exchange. The oft-quoted 17% selloff per price doubling amounts to pretty significant spending if a lot of it goes to merchants instead of being sold off directly. The more merchants, the more of that portfolio rebalancing during bull runs can be diverted to spending instead of selling, which incentivizes more merchants to adopt it in a virtuous cycle.
Basically merchants are competing for a piece of that 17% dishoarding pie every time the BTC price doubles. Or more precisely, a piece of whatever percentage of that 17% dishoarding pie is used to buy stuff (a prudent investor wouldn't spend the entire [rake](

There are really two arguments in that vein: 
1) Volatility will decrease gradually with each passing order of magnitude as infrastructure for derivatives gets created and it generally takes more money to move the market. So far the volatility is way down compared to the 2011 bubble, where something like a 30x increase and 15x drop happened in less than a year. The recent volatility has been overwhelmingly upward, going up 100x last year and down a relatively quite small 4x this year. Arguably Bitcoin is still too small a market for billionaires and big hedge funds to play in, so the volatility should remain quite high until we go to their league and beyond.
2) The volatility will start going away as we approach mainstream adoption, simply because its valuation will be obvious and it'll cease to be much of a speculative asset. Consider that gold is way less volatile, then consider if gold were mainstream as a currency how it would be even far less than that. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 21:23:55
Bitcoin is an investment that, when it grows so much you want to rebalance, you can directly spend. In that case it is easy and you get the full benefits since you don't need to buy back. 
If you, for whatever reason (privacy, discount, access) feel compelled to spend bitcoins even with the added hassle of buying them back, then do. If not, just HODL. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 00:33:12
Since hoarding bitcoins is also a good thing, I don't think number of transactions should be your *sole* reason for being optimistic, or even a main reason. It's a useful measure of the transactional growth of a system that is much more than just transactions and that, at this time, is far more valuable to most people as a wealth preservation tool.

It shouldn't. Keep in mind that this is mostly a situation of "never happened before so people have no defences in place for it." It could happen once (very unlikely!), and it could cause substantial short-term disruption and medium-term confidence loss, but the response by the community is likely to be very inspiring to serious investors. And it will probably then never happen again. It may well be long-term bullish just to have someone try, since that Sword of Damocles would no longer be hanging in the air. That is anti-fragility in action.

Think of it this way: 
At what percentage of their capacity is the average piece of data equipment running, on a 24/365 basis? If it's, say, 10% then there's either ten times as much equipment as there theoretically needs to be, it's ten times more expensive than it needs to be, or we could be using ten times more bandwidth with the same equipment. A market for apportioning that excess supply should be able to realize a lot of that theoretical gain.

You do realize this has happened before, right? Look up Deepbit.
Also, there are no mystical things pools can do when they pass 50%. They could doublespend, deny some blocks, etc., but the only thing that could have a lasting effect is a one-time volley of double spends corrupting part of the ledger, and even that - while unfortunate - still doesn't open any kind of hole for competitors like fiat, gold, or altledgers to look like superior alternatives. Fiat and gold the argument is obvious, but even altledgers are far too small and nascent to be contenders.
 Bitcoin is way way wayyy better than it even needs to be to eclipse all competitors. Even if (very small chance!) it had some small unfairness happen once or twice during its adolescence, it would still be the only game in town - the only global asset ledger remotely fit for the job.

That's pretty darn unlikely, though of course possible. 
One little secret, or more of an open secret since it's right on the historical price chart in log scale, is that when the price goes super-exponential* upward the bubble top is right around the corner. Well right now the price is going super-exponential downward, as shown by the downward curve on the log chart. I'll leave people to guess what that could mean :)
*Exponential growth is constant percentage growth, such as doubling every four weeks; super-exponential growth is exponential percentage growth, such as the price doubling in four weeks, then two weeks, then one week, then 3.5 days, etc. On a logarithmic chart, exponential growth looks like a straight line pointing up and to the right, whereas super-exponential looks like a line curving upward (it looks the exact same as an exponential growth curve looks on a standard chart).

Well you're right that miners are selling more now: they have to after this unprecedented period of mining investment. People have been buying mining rigs instead of buying bitcoins, which is one factor weighing on the price. Once difficulty gets too high, that pendulum will swing back to buying bitcoins directly. Difficulty takes turns with price in this race. This time mining is gonna massively overshoot, which means the price could well do the same. But for now we see the reverse effect.

Anti-fragile systems solve themselves, but maybe with bruises. Oh well, we might get some bruises. There's no competition, so it doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of things.

I can understand the logic of including bitcoin buyback and all associated costs in the price, if that's your use case, but right now - as long as the price tends to appreciate 10x per year - hodlers are always eventually left bitcoin-heavy in their portfolios. Anything that lessens the percentage of bitcoins they hold down toward something more reasonable requires no buyback. That of course includes buying something on NewEgg with bitcoins, using bitcoins for remittance, donating bitcoins, etc. All these just save steps, rather than selling the excess coins on exchange and then using fiat money to do the same things. 
When bitcoins stop rising in value so rapidly maybe we would start wanting to include buyback fees into the remittance price like this, but then again by that time we won't need buyback (or third parties for remittance).

Yeah, that one gets way too much play. If gold reverted to its industrial and decorative value, gold holders would lose something like 90% of their investment. Saying Bitcoin can go to zero doesn't sound that bad when you realize gold can go to 0.1 if its unforgeability were lost, for example.

In most cases, probably. It's complicated because on the one hand, as the Naval Ravikant video showed, many entrepreneurs and coders see altcoins as the new IPO, or an enabler of IPOs for open source software, and monetizing open source work creates good incentives; however, just because appcoin creation *could* in theory become the premier IPO mechanism for anonymous and/or open source projects doesn't mean it will. 
Much dev talent and entrepreneurial genius have been wasted on ill-thought out altcoin schemes, especially premined altcoins, whereas the teams that seem to be doing the most to build the needed infrastructure are largely eschewing this method: Counterparty issued its token solely through proof of donation to all other bitcoin holders (a.k.a. proof of burn) and runs on top of Bitcoin, Storj issued at least one of its tokens on Counterparty, and Open Bazaar has no appcoin and is planning to use Bitcoin proof of burn to imbue trust (trust ratings could be called their appcoin).

There's never been this much of an incentive for individuals within the state apparatus to side with something that systematically weakens that apparatus. 
Added for clarification on the above: It's about individuals, not institutions. The "be your own bank" thing is useful to *everyone*, and if done right it presents no political cost since no one has to know.

Lately "moonish" price projections are unpopular. It's weird, though, because if you don't think success means hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars per bitcoin, and in not very many years, then why would you be buying such a scary and volatile asset? 
Perhaps people are now assigning non-single-digit chances to Bitcoin's ultimate success. If not, the expected values make no sense. For example, if you only believe there's a 1% chance Bitcoin makes it big (and that it goes to zero if it doesn't), and you're holding out for "the moon" at $10,000 when it does, the expected value of your holdings is negative.

You're correct, but 1) the impact will be a lot more gradual and less shocking than a direct sell-off on an exchange, 2) there's a strong possibility the winning bid will be a high one from a person or organization that is reluctant to obtain bitcoins any other way, so it's quite possible this buyer has been holding off buying just for this kind of opportunity, 3) they will likely hold them for quite a while - probably ages in Bitcoin time, and 4) the publicity this will generate will probably more than make up for the slight increase in available coins.

~Lasagna Burning at a Dinner for Three~
Dave: Let's split this plate of lasagna.
Sarah: Cool, a third for each of us.
Ryan: Nah, not hungry. You two can have it all. I forfeit my portion.
Dave: What a waste! You're burning your portion! 
Ryan: Nah man, I'm just giving it to you. What's the big deal?
Dave: That lasagna portion is valuable, and now we'll have to split it in two and there'll be one less lasagna portion in the world. Didn't you see those starving children out front? Why don't you give it to them?
Sarah: Yeah, better than wasting it. As it stands there are three lasagna portions, but if you get your way there will only be two, since me and Dave will get the two halves of the plate. What kind of heartless jerk are you?
Ryan: Y'know, you two could donate part of your two portions to the starving children. No lasagna is actually being lost here...

It's certainly possible that tiny payments will simply melt into other things like sharing, freemium, and reward points.
However, I think size of transaction is the wrong metric. What matters is size of transaction *versus inconvenience of arranging and making payment*. If you could collect $0.05 every time you yielded to a rich person on the freeway, in an automatic app that showed yielding ops on your car navigation system (or smartphone on dashboard), I think that could be a very big economy. And that's just one example.

If we're being reasonable we should compare Bitcoin now to credit cards in their infancy. The weaknesses of Bitcoin brought up so far in this thread are all problems that a savvy user doesn't have; these are the kinds of problems that go away as the technology and ecosystem around it matures. Meanwhile credit cards have had decades to mature and still these massive leaks happen, affecting all users (through either identity theft or higher fees passed down from CC companies due to higher insurance costs).

So basically you linked to your patient's imgur posting, which was saying, "I paid my dentist in Bitcoin," so that (perhaps automatically) became the title of your post. Not that YOU paid, not that you were the "I," but just as catchy title in the style that some titles are written on reddit speaking in the person of whoever is being linked to. Perhaps keeping the quotes in the title would have avoided this, so it was clear you were basically quoting your patient as the title of the post. 
And yes, people will accuse you because of this. I personally believe you since the pics are obviously too much trouble to stage, but the idea could be that yes this did happen but you want to make two posts about it for extra publicity or something, and make it look like it's from two people as a way to boost it. Most innocent case is you're sort of a reddit newbie and you clicked on the reddit alien on imgur and it gave you a default title and you just went with it. If that happened, that sucks :)

The company loses when the price falls, and gains when the price rises. If Bitcoin is to succeed, the price will rise a lot more than fall. Besides, there are such things as hedges, which until Counterparty or similar betting platform gets big won't be easy for individuals to use, but are fairly easy for companies to implement.

If they're that bad, name names so we can go through their posting history and add some concreteness to the discussion. 
Edit: Half the time people say "troll" anymore they just mean a poster who loudly and sometimes jeeringly disagrees and maybe doesn't put much thought into their posts, is rigid in their viewpoint, etc. Moderation is a bit much for that, because that is the natural state of most humans when in a forum that is hostile to their beliefs. Human nature prevents most people who disagree from being nice about it, and ego usually prevents people in a place where everyone disagrees with them from being perfectly civil. 
Wanting to keep open dialog with opposing viewpoints requires a fairly generous allowance for the unfortunate natural trappings of such disagreement. The opposing viewpoints tooth fairy isn't going to give us a perfect set of rational interlocutors to fence with. The borderline trolls at least make it feel somewhat socially acceptable for the more rational dissenters to jump in.

Frictionless decentralized betting could dramatically change the world all by itself. 
For example, ubiquitous betting enables ubiquitous insurance. Everything that would benefit from being insured, could be insured - provided the relevant oracles were available. Business risks, especially in the third world, could be mitigated against like never before.
Imagine a farmer in Kenya for whom one bad season could mean his family starves. For him, hedging risk is a matter of life and death; yet he's one of the last people on the planet you'd expect to have crop insurance. 
Ubiquitous insurance changes the very character of the industry. When everyone can get reliable insurance with no credentials, with no middlemen, with tiny spreads, with a phone app, in seconds, insurance will be used for a whole lot more things. On the train to the airport but will miss your connecting flight if the train is more than 15 minutes late? Odds: 0.1%, total personal loss estimate: $2000. Pull out your phone, open an app, create a bet, select from a set of suggested oracles, enter bet amount. Instant hedge! 
If Bitcoin expands the division of labor to encompass everything any human being can do for another - any win-win trade two people can make based on their differing priorities and abilities - a distributed betting platform expands that to risk hedging. Any event with low probability but horrible results for you can be hedged by someone for whom the results are not so horrible. For instance, you might buy rain insurance for your outdoor wedding even though the chance of rain is only 5%. The counterparties to the trade win by getting a positive expected return on their investment, and so do you, simply because you care a lot if it rains in your town on that day and they don't. To make this work, weather.com and other sites would simply have to release PGP-signed weather data in a feed. The contract might specify several oracles, or 2 out of 3, to prevent gaming. (The redeeming party could either submit the relevant signed feed data in order to collect, or perhaps it could be done automatically.)
Yet still, that's only one half of it. As we saw with Intrade's uncanny accuracy at predicting the outcomes of elections, frictionless betting also brings the full promise of the Internet alive as a collective consciousness. How good would weather forecasting get if the importance of getting it right were baked into the movements of value in the economy? Far from being some kind of den of vice as the name seems to hint, ubiquitous betting that can't be shut down or censored or disrupted represents for the first time actual correct pricing of knowledge in society in the most direct way. 
The price on the universal betting platform would fairly soon become the most reliable coalescence of society's knowledge and predictive capacity on a given event. Only the most confident would have the conviction to bet large amounts, and those that were irrationally confident would soon lose their money while the best predictors would grow rich and have more and more capital to invest, signalling ever more faithfully the best known probability of the outcome to society. 
This is just a small sampling of just one aspect of one of the many things Counterparty or other decentralized betting platform can do. Just imagining a world where everything is reliably, instantly, and very cheaply insurable/hedgable is enough to set the mind racing for hours or days at the possibilities. The sum total of all these innovations is surely, to us here now, incalculable.

This reply is late, but I agree with the idea that too much % change is a bad sign. However, the idea I want to present is that the deflation/inflation is actually a signal for how much to tilt toward investment. It's the answer to the question of how much. 
Rather than tying to optimize the level of inflation/deflation, the level of inflation/deflation (again given a fixed money supply) optimizes the investment incentives in the economy. The very meaning of overinvestment or underinvestment hinges on how productive the rest of the economy is, which is exactly what inflation/deflation in a fixed money system indicates.

To make a complete argument for market manipulation resulting in "price failure" you'd have to at least theoretically show how a series of buys and sells could drive the price to zero or keep it down indefinitely. 
I can think of ways to keep the price bottled up for a while, but in the case where Bitcoin continues its exponential adoption all of those ways merely delay the inevitable price rise and make the explosion all the bigger when it finally happens. You can only shake out weak hands (price chasers) for so long before the strong hands form the vast majority, and then manipulation becomes a losing proposition as it's just donating coins to the strong hands (strong hands here denotes any investor who is dead-set on holding regardless of price movements, or dead-set on buying if they don't yet have any).

Safety can mean various things. Traditional assets are mostly either clearly safe-haven assets or clearly not, but Bitcoin has the risk and upside of a traditional non-safe-haven asset while having the immunity to jurisdiction and confiscation that something like gold has (only much, much better).
If you're wealthy and concerned about having *access* to your money at all times (no bail-ins, account freezing, bank runs, sovereign defaults to worry about, and no need to be in a specific place or trust a specific jurisdiction or other third party like with physical gold), Bitcoin can look pretty darn good, and to some even the obvious choice. Insofar as safety means these types of things, Bitcoin can indeed be considered a safe haven.

I think I see the problem: I said "punishing users," but I should have said "punishing investors" (is a death sentence). You're not necessarily talking about punishing investors, because this is in the future when the block reward is small and I assume Bitcoin is mainstream. At that time, there would be no more investors since all the upside would be gone. Punishing savers at that time doesn't mean inflation or breaking the 21M limit (just moving the coins around), it means taxing what can truly be called savers in the traditional sense. It drives home how the game changes quite a bit after the investment phase ends.
I suppose I have no objection to that in principle, but I do wonder how you'd get around people simply sending their savings coins to other addresses they also own. I suppose whatever rate was set would reach an equilibrium with the mining fees such that moving the coins around at a rate fast enough to avoid or reduce the "tax" would cost more in total fees and end up balancing out. You'd have wallets that automatically churned the coins for a while I guess, and then once it really equilibriated people wouldn't bother anymore because either way the miners get their same cut. 
Considering that economic growth globally should be some single-digit percent per year, which would cause natural deflation, the amount going to miners (X trillion dollars' worth) would be plenty to fund security and still not punish savers in real terms, only nominally. Then again, the fees in such a situation seem like they'll be plenty to me as well.
@_date: 2014-10-02 08:34:24
One reason for the downswing, besides just the obvious fact that you don't expect to go up 100x in a year without a pretty serious correction, is that people who got in last year are mostly spoiled weak hands because they got used to constant price growth. The people here now are being forged from iron as strong hands who fundamentally understand Bitcoin rather than their belief in it being ultimately tied to the price. They will tend not to be lily-livered sellers during the next bubble, which means it will go that much higher.

Normal retail payments aren't nearly as broken as remittances and other more unusual payments, and those in turn aren't nearly as broken as the fiat money system where governments can tax people through the stealthy process of inflation.
ETA: Retail (especially brick and mortar) is the last and least important thing for Bitcoin to disrupt. It's not a low-hanging fruit. That said, merchant adoption does help make bitcoins slightly more liquid and add perceived legitimacy.

I've long argued that since Bitcoin is overwhelmingly bought as an investment rather than as a way to enable new shopping avenues, the main reason to spend it is as a faster way of dishoarding when your portfolio becomes bitcoin-heavy (i.e., when the price rises a lot). Instead of selling on an exchange for a fee, risking shenanigans at the exchange, wiring the fiat back to your account for a fee, and then spending that money on a new computer from NewEgg.com, you can just buy the computer for bitcoins directly, saving almost all the fees and the risk and hassle and waiting time. 
If spending is primarily a more efficient way to take profits, then it makes sense that Black Friday spending last year when the price had gone up 100x was strong but this year when the price has gone down few people are itching to dishoard so spending is very weak. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 01:48:57

Downvoted for reverse psychology to balance out those who hesitated; many redditors can't help but fall for this dastardly trick ;) and also because 1 is not a big deal ("damage" to the temporary price is not damage to Bitcoin), 2 is false (actually the opposite is true) as long as the price increases at even a tiny fraction of the historical exponential growth (edit: actually technically true as you worded it, but then not a big deal: the payouts will remain huge), and 3 should be changed to "it *can be* irreversible," if we are speaking of any payment system utilizing Bitcoin, which is in fact an awesome and unprecedented benefit.

I've looked into double-deposit escrow schemes like this several times over the past year and I don't think they work - at least not on their own.
In this case the seller can scam: Seller never ships, but buyer still signs because buyer would rather have 2 BTC back than none. Seller will undoubtedly point this out if buyer fails to cotton on.
This remains true even as the buyer's deposit ~~increases~~**decreases**, until the buyer has nothing to lose by not signing, in which case the buyer can be lazy and never sign even if the product is received. (However, this *plus* a reputation system may work.)

Since burned bitcoins are the exact same as donations to every other bitcoin holder, the "utilized more intelligently" is an impossibly high bar: who among us is more intelligent than all of us? Who among us is more intelligent than millions of bitcoin holders each analyzing how to allocate their money (including their newfound wealth from price appreciation thanks to burned coins) in the most efficient way? 
All those who are interested in donating a percentage of their wealth to charity and who therefore might support this change to a donation address would of course also, by hypothesis, donate that same percentage of the marginal wealth increase owing to proof of burn. Except each person could donate it to charities they understand best. Again, crowdsourcing of knowledge rather than unilateral decisions. If p2pool would be the best recipient, let the market decide.
From this line of reasoning I hope it's clear that choosing a specific donation recipient over proof of burn (a.k.a. "proof of donation to every bitcoiner") is merely central planning and attempting to mold people's donation habits to something they are too unintelligent or selfish to do themselves. This is a kind of fatal conceit, believing that one person or group of special people knows where capital should be focused in the economy...which is arguably the very thing Bitcoin was invented to avoid.
@_date: 2014-05-26 09:27:34
Visualizations seem especially appropriate since we're faced with a unique challenge in communicating Bitcoin's value proposition. It requires a particularly tight combination of clarity and succinctness while showing context within the big picture complete with implications for and interplay with other technologies. This is something only a visual can achieve.
On a platform like Prezi, you could have a diagram like this one but if you zoom in on any node or connection you'd get more and more detail. Like if you zoomed in on Bitcoin you'd get a full diagrammatic presentation of the cryptographically secured distributed open-source ledger system, and if you zoomed further into any of these elements, you'd get further explanation on, say, the cryptography - including embedded Youtube videos, etc. 
Basically a visual wiki where you zoom in to get more detail instead of clicking links, so it's clear, succinct, comprehensive yet tailored to each user's knowledge and/or misgivings, and everything stays in context with the big picture and how everything fits together always in sight.

If what you say is true, it is the initial investors who are getting shafted. Supply and demand tells us that they are mostly holding, or else the price would be a lot lower. If it is fantasy pricing, they are losing out horribly by holding at this time; they should be selling.
Nothing unfair is happening. Most relevantly, the devs have no advantage over the thousands of others who participated in the burn.

As someone who completely disagrees with your economic views, it is deplorable that people would label you a troll for that. 
Sarcasm, mocking humor, stubbornness, moving goalposts, and other annoying aspects that anyone with deeply held opposing views might bring here is par for the course. To a Keynesian this is a hostile place; we should expect civility, but are we really going to expect argumentative perfection at all times? It's a whole lot easier when everyone is on your side, and even then it's not uncommon for bitcoiners to do the same things - just about everyone does them in argument. 
People aren't perfect. Leaving discussions open to opposing views isn't going to look like a bunch of bitcoiners politely playing devil's advocate, it's going to look like a bunch of people who secretly (or not) think you are *fucking insane* for believing the things you do, and are feeling quite unwelcome and harried as well.

Crypto-what? Crypto-ledger, very likely yes. Crypto-protocol, perhaps not - but that is of no concern for investors as long Bitcoin remains the dominant ledger. There is no reason why the monetary aspects of Bitcoin would need to changed, let alone abandoned entirely for a whole new ledger, but technological considerations may certainly require updates to how the protocol goes about maintaining that ledger with those monetary characteristics.
The network effect applies to the ledger, because that's where the memory (Money as Memory) is encoded.

Without government backstops, brokerages would be very careful in dealing with naked shorts. Just like margin trading and derivatives, things could get quite dicey if leverage is high enough. 
A naked short in itself, though, is simply a broker extending credit to the short seller. Nothing evil about it. However, with the government backstops in place it becomes somewhat questionable, which is why the SEC regulates it. It's a classic case of one government action (restrictions on naked shorting) trying to mitigate the bad effects of another government action (bailouts and the associated moral hazard).

Punishing users for holding a currency isn't a plan, it's a death sentence. Not to mention that changing the 21 million limit would destroy the very bedrock upon which Bitcoin's promise is built. 
Edit: To the larger argument: the idea that mining reward will be so low (because it's far in the future after several halvings), at a point when we need so much security (because the price is so high because we've reached mainstream adoption), and the fees aren't enough because number of transactions are so low (because we haven't reached mainstream adoption yet)...is contradictory.

A see an actual troll every once in a while, but they usually act like you'd expect: bored high school students. They get downvoted, a few people who don't understand why feeding trolls is a loser's game reply, and everyone else ignores it. I haven't noticed any kind of epidemic. Anyone who is just obviously being abusive, spamming for profit, etc. falls under the mods' authority, but the mere combination of shallow thinking with in-your-face disagreement is easily dealt with through downvotes and judicious replies whenever newbies might get confused by the rhetoric. 
There are also part-time trolls who are generally sincerely critical of Bitcoin and try their best to call attention to perceived weak points, sometimes - being humans in an environment that is continually hostile to them - they spill over into trollish territory. These people provide useful practice and keep us on our toes, so I definitely wouldn't want them gone.

I was recently thinking about whether some kind of "proof of location" would be possible. It seems like there are a lot of applications that could be enabled if such a thing existed.  
This is just brainstorming, but time and location are related, and Bitcoin is a distributed time-stamping service. If, for instance, there were a bunch of satellites running Bitcoin nodes, perhaps they could provide some sort of independent verification of the location from which a transaction was broadcast. 
The fallback solution would be to resort to a trust and reputation system like OpenBazaar has in the works.

No, the readership (who also upvote and downvote) self-select as being interested in Bitcoin. They will only upvote something *en masse* if they find it relevant, as bitcoiners. On occasion, altcoins and related discussions are relevant, even if just to keep everyone clued in on why altcoins are pointless. 
The mentality suggested in your posts reminds me of Georgetown professor John Hasnas's first-year tort law students devising how they think assault-and-battery rules should work:




As a moderator, you presume to be smarter than 130,000 people, most who are primarily interested in Bitcoin, all thinking and acting in a way that attempts to maximize the usefulness of the content here, both by dismissing irrelevant content and promoting especially relevant content. Your personal theories about what is relevant to the readership here will, as with the tort law students, invariably fail to account for the contours of what turns out to actually be useful and relevant. 
For example, as a bitcoiner, I sure as hell want to know whether or not there is a serious contender coming up. That means *sometimes* some altcoins will have to be discussed - even if only to dismiss them - otherwise we're flying blind in our own little bubble, thanks to overprotective modding.

A series of people trying to do things with their money that only Bitcoin can do:
* Mad scientist tries to beams his gold bars to someone across the world using a transporter, perhaps with the first gold bar showing up on the other side momentarily and then disintegrating into a ham sandwich
* Wealthy Chinese family tries to board an international flight with a [mokeskin pouch]( stuffed with millions in cash (kids have Harry Potter shirts/hats on), or just a suitcase full of cash, or any number of variations on this
* Starving farmer in Africa asks for donations on reddit/etc. and sets up a giant bullseye with a basket to catch money catapulted in from overseas
Then maybe show the Bitcoin versions, perhaps with a [Kool-Aid style]( burst in of "Bitcoin Man" (giant coin with face, arms and legs) to save the day. 
The mad scientist is then shown tapping a smartphone and sending an equivalent value to the recipient, the Chinese family is shown with the mother/father having a passphrase stored in her/his mind with the value shown in overlay and perhaps a wink at the camera as they pass customs and Bitcoin Man wishing them well, and the African farmer is shown holding a QR code taking a smiling selfie posed with Bitcoin Man as donations pour in. 
The Bitcoin Man part could prevent it from going viral because it's too directly like a commercial, but it isn't as important as the initial idea: people trying to do comically impossible things with fiat/gold as if they can be done, but they can with Bitcoin.
Since there are actually more than three "impossible" things Bitcoin can do, it could be expanded into a series if the first one went viral.

And with drops like this, how many of the people who ordered pizza for Laszlo Hanyecz managed to keep anywhere near the full 10,000 bitcoins over the years? And keep in mind there have been way worse drops than this. 
Days like today are a stark example of why it takes balls of steel to ride the long-term bull market. To imagine that some average income dude is holding his multimillion dollar stash of 10,000 BTC without selling any, knowing it could crash extremely or even go to zero and he'd be right back to being a wage slave, is comical. Sadly, this cartoon version of how investing works is what almost everyone believes, despite it evaporating with a few moments' consideration of the actual incentives at play.
The only early adopters who hit it insanely big are those who were a) already rich so could afford to sit tight even through giant drops, b) forgot they had any for a few years and remembered recently, c) were too foolish to rebalance their portfolio despite extreme risk, d) were true believers and simply refused to sell.

While the past is by no means a perfect predictor of the future, it's absolutely a factor in that prediction. 


Not "no" reason. Past performance is certainly *a* reason to expect a continuation of that performance - a very important one. It's not generally enough all by itself to make a full case for investing in an asset, and lazily staking substantial funds on the trend continuing without keeping abreast of developments is foolish, but that takes nothing away from the basic fact that past performance is one of the best available indicators in the complex, multifactor picture of an investment.

Wait, have you actually asked them for yen? Because they're continuing to pay out just fine in Japan, at most with 2-3 week delay.

Government is not a monolithic entity. It's more like a collection of fiefdoms, and ultimately it's just a bunch of people looking out for themselves and their families. Since it's possible to obtain and hold bitcoins anonymously, and since they're useful for many of the offshoring activities that appeal to the power elite, the incentive on many of the individuals in government may soon turn out to be pro-Bitcoin. 
At the end of the day, they'd rather save themselves than their fiefdom, which means looking out for their investment interests rather than their government.

One fundamental mistake in talking about decentralization is the assumption that it's an all or nothing proposition. In fact it's a spectrum, from barely or tenuously decentralized to extremely decentralized. There is some correct amount of decentralization that balances the various factors at play. 
The error comes about when people worry that raising the blocksize limit will reduce decentralization, in an argument that essentially says, "Decentralization level X is the correct level, but decentralization level Y errs on the side of too little decentralization." Well why does the arbitrary blocksize limit Satoshi put in as a temporary measure just happen to be "just the right amount" of decentralization? 
If you want to argue that the blocksize limit shouldn't increase because that would reduce the decentralization factor, you must also explain why the blocksize limit shouldn't be reduced! Why is the current size the golden amount, the optimal level of decentralization? Why indeed not more? What, are you anti-decentralization??

It's funny that Rui mentions prediction markets then goes on to wonder if decentralized insurance will ever be a thing. Prediction markets *are* insurance markets. Insurance policy holders and providers are ultimately just taking different sides of the same set of bets about the future. 
Example: Outdoor wedding scheduled for tomorrow, chance of rain 1%, estimated cost of rescheduling $20,000 which is financially infeasible for the parties, mother of the bride discusses with the three other parties paying for the wedding then opens an app on her phone, places a $200 bet that it will rain in that region tomorrow, risk hedged, financial fears of all four parties allayed for only $50 each. On the "insurer" side, early takers eagerly buy the other side of the bet for the easy money, until the odds match the real world odds, at which point there is no further easy money incentive. Other than a slight spread and a tiny cut automatically allocated to the weather data feed(s) designated in the smart contract as determining the outcome of the bet, there are no overhead fees.

Prediction markets are famously accurate, especially once they get large and liquid. That means they may prove superior to the actuarial calculations at insurance companies, especially in less conventional cases, meaning less over- or under-insuring of patients. That seems potentially a lot more efficient. Also, many people in the world can't get insurance at all, so for them it will potentially open that door, although more peripheral systems like biometrics and quantified self type data and apps might need to be available for the full vision as far as medicine.

Well you're basically right that sales figures are likely to be underwhelming at first, and these companies (and even the people who spend bitcoins rather than save them) are very early adopters. If sales figures were big, everyone would jump on board *right now*. After all, what company couldn't use another revenue stream? 
EDIT: Also, the main reason to spend bitcoins now, for the everyday person, is as another way to do your [standard 10-20% dishoard]( for each doubling of the Bitcoin price. (If you can buy stuff directly instead of selling on exchange, wiring to bank and then buying stuff, it saves times, money, 3rd-party risk, and hassle.) 
The thinking now by NewEgg and friends is to get out in front of this thing (Bitcoin) *before* it takes over, *before* it's obviously profitable to do so - that is, before everyone else has already figured out the ins and outs and left the laggards to tread water and eat losses.

The whole original notion that currency had to be "backed by" something arose from central banks and governments issuing fiat money that isn't redeemable for anything so that there is nothing to limit its issuance, meaning that your holdings could be diluted at the central issuer's whim. Since Bitcoin's issuance had a hard limit that can't be changed by any central authority, the question of backing never arises.
In other words, *promises* are what need backing. 
Now people also use the word backing in a more general line of questioning about what gives bitcoins their value. For that, the best answer is that all money derives its value from its function as a way of keeping track of credit/debt in society, and Bitcoin is just a better way of doing that.

Whether by manipulation or by news or by government action or by nothing at all, volatility will remain until the market cap is massively higher and there is simply no longer enough wealth in the world to rock that gigantic boat.

Indeed, we can't lose sight of the fact that Bitcoin *as a payment mechanism* is still in the very early adopters/innovators stage. Smaller niche companies aside, any major company accepting Bitcoin now is just doing it to get ready for the future, to make headlines, to see what it's about and if there might be profit potential, or to support it because someone in management likes it. 
Once we start seeing closed loops in B2B, we'll have reached the next stage and really be off to the races. For now, Bitcoin is an investment and wealth preservation mechanism.

That's a change of tune from 1996 when he wrote in a [Fed research paper]( that "the government's monopoly on seignorage might be in some jeopardy as information access and storage costs decline" for electronic systems that constitute perfect records of transactions (like bitcoin). That paper is actually one of the foundational papers I recommend for understanding Bitcoin and how it can perform the very same functions as money without being tangible.

Actually the premine on coins like Ripple and NXT makes the market cap look way bigger than it should be. It's the market price times the number of coins in existence, so since the market supply is extremely restricted the price (and hence the market cap) is artificially inflated may times over. That's why on coinmarketcap.com they let you filter out nonmineable coins (though this unfairly leaves out certain coins that weren't premined, like Counterparty).

Calling the mining reward a subsidy for tx processing is incorrect and has been debunked many times before.

Banking-style transactions and periodic buys and sells can be done, though; yet Counterparty won't really function as a true asset exchange until prediction markets exist to accompany it.

Ultimately a gold peg will be established based on trusted entities in the gold market publishing signed price feeds that can be imported into Counterparty contracts directly, enabling futures and decentralized delivery in that you can go to any gold dealer or even any individual who accepts Bitcoin-based synthetic gold or gold futures and trade them for actual gold, presumably with some markup for the "delivery fee," and - until the peg/prediction market grows large enough and proves itself - a fee for the added market risk. Sure you could just buy gold from then with BTC (just as you could with dollars), but this way they can give you the physical without reducing their desired exposure to the gold price.

If it's only $125 to obtain a bitcoin through mining,* that gives another direct explanation why the price is throttling and the mining power keeps skyrocketing: a lot of the money that would have gone into bidding up the price is instead going into mining. Once the difficulty is high enough, that stream of cash will again be diverted into buying bitcoins directly. 
The famous cypherdoc on Bitcointalk has a theory that money entering the Bitcoin ecosystem is at times diverted into different sectors: mining, infrastructure, startups, and of course direct buying. Only direct buying contributes to price rises. 
This suggests that as long as money continues to flow into some sector within Bitcoin, the price will eventually follow suit. 
Case in point: this year we've had tremendous investment by venture capitalists and miners, but dull price action. The money spigots have simply been redirected. When they turn back to buying bitcoins, watch out! Once the startup field and mining sector are temporarily saturated, that stream of interested VCs and miners will become a stream of direct investors. And then once the price has risen too far, people will again be incentivized to focus on startups and mining. 
EDIT:*Of course it's more than that, in effect, due to variance, equipment costs, time investment, expertise limiting the pool of people who can mine, delivery issues, etc. The point of crossover where the cost to mine a bitcoin rises to the level that it becomes cheaper for a typical new entrant into the Bitcoin space to buy bitcoins directly rather than mine them will be significantly lower than the market price. For all I know, $125 could be it, though it seems quite a bit too low.

ETA: Once your wealth is in Bitcoin, you start to wonder why you'd ever want it in something as risky and capriciously-controlled as fiat money, or even as gold sitting in some government's jurisdiction. There's absolutely no reason for a wealthy person not to have some significant portion of their wealth in Bitcoin at least as a hedge against regime uncertainty and legal risk, once they understand it and the benefits of it and how to handle it securely. For people in the developing world, this is even more true. It's just knowledge that's missing. And that, like with the Internet, will change over the months and years.

If it were an attempt at making money for the devs, you'd think they would have not put themselves on equal footing with everyone else as far as investment. Even a straight mined coin favors those who were mining on Day 1, before word has had much time to spread and push the difficulty up. The Counterparty burn period was *two months*.
Also, stocks are the least interesting thing about Counterparty. Contracts for difference enabling things like insurance and prediction markets, which with enough liquidity enable mirroring portfolios for any stock market in the world (making even decentralized stock markets obsolete), are where the action is.

Well yeah, BITCOIN IS NOT A CURRENCY. Who said it was? A currency has to have "currency," meaning it is accepted by most everyone. It won't be a currency except in certain niche circles (and even then usually won't be a full currency because it usually won't be a unit of account). 
It won't be a currency in general until it is mainstream, and shouldn't be judged as one. The standard for comparison is gold. If Bitcoin replaces gold, it will be something like a million dollars per bitcoin, so no worries about not being a currency when considering the price.

This is a total myth. 
1) The work is necessary, as the cost of mining will tend toward making it exactly as expensive as it needs to be to attack the network *given the incentives* (i.e., current market cap). In a system where anyone can participate on equal footing, easy to maintain = easy to attack. There's no way around this other than removing equal participation, e.g., proof of stake where the initial stakeholders have advantages (even if they sell their stake - cf. the "nothing at stake" attack).
2) The inflation schedule is baked in and known. **If** people thought the inflation rate was capped at 13 million, bitcoins would have cost a lot more by now. The miners are being rewarded for doing what is necessary to maintain the network given its current market cap. This is indispensable.

I don't downvote them, but tiny tips even on this subreddit do take up screen real estate, which bothers some people since it means slightly more scrolling and scanning for everyone. 
One otherwise contentless tip for a few cents and one confirmation from the bot means tens of thousands of people each have to scroll an extra inch to get to the content they're looking for. This becomes a lot more of an annoyance for anyone on a phone. An extra second to scroll and scan past the content time thousands can add up to hours of lost time, especially when there are multiple tips.
Now to be fair there are positive effects as well, such as people feeling good seeing the person get tipped. You can't please everyone. But ultimately reddit is about distilling the best content at the top, so low-value tips that have no other content might get downvoted as part of that distillation process, especially if they double the real estate cost by having the bot do a confirmation.

The evpsych explanation is that our recent ancestors on an evolutionary timescale lived in tribes of about 50-200 people, where the instincts you mentioned are effective at coordinating society for maximum prosperity (and hence gene reproduction). The whole story of statism and economic ignorance and counterintuitiveness could be singlehandedly explained by overlarge tribe sizes. When you're hardwired to treat 300 million people as all part of your tribe, all sorts of things go haywire - systematically, across the board. Humans are in a way victims of their own evolutionary success.
What Hayek is saying is that traditions can help allieviate the havok that large tribe sizes wreak on our instinctive impulses, and that those societies whose traditions incorporated the idea of trade and profit as good things, countering our instincts to the contrary, have prospered. Moreover, that very insight is an intellectual one. Altogether, the implication is that the way in which our instincts (and some of our traditions) are broken in the modern world can be ascertained by the intellect and compensated for. It might even be said that the evolutionary purpose of intellect was to deal with those situations for which our instincts and traditions are maladapted. Economics could thus be called the field wherein we try to abstract those principles that produce the greatest welfare for society yet are hardest to detect because they run counter to our instincts and perhaps also our traditions.

It's just a matter of it being so far-fetched to believe that something would justify breaking the 21M cap that it ends up being a conversation-stopper, as a heuristic. I'm pretty sure only clear mortal danger would allow people to put that idea on the table, and most people in Bitcoin seem to have a high threshold for even considering it in far-future scenarios. 
To make the argument that miners can't be subsidized enough by the block reward to such an extent that it'll be a mortal danger, at least any time in the next, say, 50 years, seems a very high bar.

Sure, XCP will never run out. But not running out does not mean it still functions as anti-spam, and more than that, why is merely avoiding spam the end of ambitions here? Why model it after domain name registration, where there is an arbitrary fee to register a name, resulting in an arbitrary level at which people decide it's worth it to squat on a name? Doubling the fee might result in ten times fewer names squatted on; halving it might result in ten times more.
I think we can do better than following in the footsteps of a centralized model. It seems to me that from the very beginning, names shouldn't just be snagged by the first comer for an arbitrary fee, but rather can be opened up for bidding for a set time period (perhaps 10 days*), where winning bid in XCP gets the name. That way names like DOLLAR and GOOGLE will cost a lot, and names like BERZLQRX111 will cost very little (minimum fee could be as you suggested, if even necessary). This bidding can hopefully be done in Counterparty natively.
*might seem like a long time, but given assets aren't worth anything without trust it doesn't seem that ten days would matter for things like stock.

It always strikes me as funny that popularity is held up as the ultimate standard in questions of science. You'd think logical sciences like economics and mathematics would be the one place where arguments from authority and popularity would get no respect, but it's the exact opposite. It's all about who's cited more and who won the Swedish central bank's Nobel prize. Terms like consensus, respected, highly cited, etc. have no place in science and constitute a tacit argumentum ad populum fallacy.

"It's not about control by particular persons or groups" is probably better phrasing. 
In his article about emergent order in legal systems, [The Depoliticization of Law]( [PDF], Georgetown law professor John Hasnas discusses the difference between control by specific persons or regimes and control by systems that evolve through the actions of humans but don't vest power in any specific people:




individuals command over others. There is a third possibility. Law can arise through a process of evolution. It can be a product of "human action, but not
the execution of any human design." In such a case, those subject to law are indeed bound, but not by the will of any particular human beings. Although
law is inherently coercive, it is not inherently a vehicle for domination. To the extent that the ideal of the rule of law consists of a vision of a society governed by "laws but not men," this conception of law places the ideal within reach.

If it's a worthy cause, great - but the fact that people are burning coins (that is, donating their value to every other holder) doesn't make that cause suddenly more worthy. If it's worthy, everyone can donate with their newly value-enriched bitcoins, thanks to the burning.

That's why I like this [video]( on the origins of money as an explanation of Bitcoin. With the understanding that money is, very roughly speaking, just memory of who did favors for whom, it seems immediately ridiculous to speak of "hoarding" money as some kind of bad thing. 
"Oh look at that guy not calling in any of the favors people owe him. What a jerk!" 
It also makes it clear that this "hoarder" is making everyone else temporarily better off, just like that friend who does a bunch of favors for you without asking for anything in return for a long time.
It additionally shows that by letting the rest of society engage in productive activities without having to also serves his needs (since he's hoarding, not calling in any favors), he essentially invests in the rest of the economy. The economy has more resources to work with than it otherwise would have, and can grow faster as a result. This boost continues for as long as he continues to hoard. And just like if he had invested in a single company or single industry index, he gets rewarded with greater purchasing power if the company or industry sector (in this case the entire economy) becomes more productive.

Destroying money is not destroying wealth. It's just donating your purchasing power to everyone else.
Consider a huge transaction where you took some bitcoins and divided them up equally to every bitcoin address in the world, proportional to how many bitcoins were in each address. That achieves exactly the same thing as burning those bitcoins. 
Proof of burn is proof of donation. Burning 10% of all the bitcoins is the exact same, economically, as donating all those coins to everyone else by increasing every person's holdings (purchasing power) by 10%. That makes sense since the burner is effectively saying, "I provided goods and services to others and they paid me in these goods-and-services vouchers. Now I'm proving to the world that I'm never going to use those vouchers; that is, I'm never going to call in those favors. I gave to society in goods and services, but I'm never going to demand repayment."
Burning bitcoins is a nice thing to do.

As others have said, you've got to phrase this more carefully or else it sounds loony to anyone who doesn't yet understand Bitcoin. 
I'd just say Bitcoin, along with the promise of its implications, sounds too good to be true. "If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is" is a very useful heuristic that is widely accepted. People were incredibly skeptical about the Internet, because it sounded too good to be true and looked very rough, just like Bitcoin. But the Internet wasn't associated with a highly unconventional investment, which always sets off alarm bells as well.

Anonymous/deniable sending could perhaps be achieved by placing the parcel in a random middle-of-nowhere but not very far away location (perhaps via the vendor's personal quadcopter) beforehand, then ordering quadcopter pickup from those coordinates for the long haul. Even if there were video surveillance there, it would require a backward search that could somehow track the delivery vehicle all the way back to the vendor. Attaching a GPS to the vehicle won't work because no one but the vendor knows the coordinates until after the vehicle has left the pickup site.
Edit: But that mechanism doesn't work on the buyer's end, since the coordinates would be known in advance.
A wilder possibility is to have some kind of tamperproof UAV with provably unknowable location except for to the current user it's being rented to. Sure the owner could simply watch or visually track it, but then a flight path that randomly goes through a cave system or other dark place could defeat that. Don't know if this even possible conceptually though.

Thank you. But it's not actually very reassuring to hear how Ghash has no interest in attacking. That makes the control sound centralized, even if they won't abuse it.

It's a nice thought, but every time volatility is mentioned this scheme is spammed and then debunked as not anything special. The way it works is BitShares delegates post price feed information (real world BTC/USD exchange rate data) and some smart contract type things - that any 2.0 platform can do - incentivize trades to buy if the peg is too low and sell if it is too high. It'll somewhat cool if their system for keeping delegates honest actually works, but they seem to be missing the obvious: if their delegates prove reliable, any other system can use the delegates' published data and create their own BitUSD. Every system I know of stands ready to do this when there are good oracles, be they delegates or whatever.
Counterparty can do this, Colored Coined can probably do this, even NXT can probably do this. BitShares makes its system sound unique and like something that only they can do, but it's not. Any group of Bitcoiners can get together and publish feed data if they want to, and then every system could use it...right in the Bitcoin system via Counterparty or Colored Coins. 
It looks to me like BitShares is just trying to do something to differentiate itself, and I applaud the initiative because it will get people thinking, but the main thing in making such a peg useful is how the oracles work. That part is what is crucial, and once that's solved every Bitcoin 2.0 platform can have prediction markets and pegs - BitShares won't be special, or necessary. And if it's not solved yet, then BitUSD is not going to be useful yet.

I suspect it's temporary. We've been seeing a tremendous mining boom after last year's meteoric price rise put the difficulty very low vs. BTC price.

Not with the right fee structure. Their best strategy is to disincentivize users to join when they get close to 50%, and to profit from that disincentivization. In other words, some kind of fee arrangement that mostly just hits those who are already willing to pay more.

Lasagna may be a consumer good, but *portions of lasagna* (imaginary segments by which someone may apportion it) aren't. 
The point is, "proof of burn = waste" is based on the very same fallacy as the one underlying the notion that "there's not enough gold in the world to use gold as money" - a basic fallacy that Mises and Rothbard both debunked. 
If burning bitcoins were in any way wasting capital, inflation by the Fed would be creating capital. It's all the same fallacy: that how much money you have means anything. The only thing that matters for your purchasing power is what *percentage* of the total money supply you control. 
Burning bitcoins doesn't change the total purchasing power available to bitcoin holders; it just moves it around. Just like forfeiting one's portion of lasagna.

Right, value is a verb. Valuation requires a valuer. The correct word isn't *intrinsic* value but something like *quasi-universal* value.

In fact, one could say that valuation is inherently (or intrinsically ;) a subjective phenomenon.

The endpoint of this would be, you push a button on your phone, speak into it, "For 1000 bits, within two minutes, what's the correct size widget for a Model ZX6839A machine?" and usually get the answer almost immediately.
People might even use it in place of a calculator, or in place of doing a Google search and having to sort through the results. Perhaps integrating with OpenBazaar's reputation system so that you might even be able to get great results from real people with questions like, "For 200 bits, what's the best Indian restaurant within a 20 minute drive that has decent garlic nan and highchairs?"

Does not compute. Money is essentially just favor vouchers, something you get for providing actual value to someone, and which you can redeem in society by effectively "calling in that favor" from someone else in the economic community when you give them a voucher. 
Hoarding large amounts of favor vouchers means doing a lot of favors for people and never calling in those favors. What could be more scrupulous than that?

"This place" told you Bitcoin wasn't volatile and that markets move in straight lines? Then I'm disappointed in this place. 
It's really simple when you break it down: The long-term exponential trendline is sitting at about $500, and the price goes below that trendline just as much as it goes above it. The price spent several months well above the trendline, so a dip well below it (i.e., well below $500 right now) was and is expected *as part of the continuing long-term bull market*.

Your entire volley of posts in this thread is because you got duped by someone at blockchain.info who either doesn't understand the statistics he or she is assembling, or just left the potentially misleading phrasing "cost per transaction" in because it's obvious it has nothing to do with how much transactions actually "cost" the sender (nor the network!). Inflation schedule is and always has been a known factor: if you hold 100 BTC then you always should have known that you hold approximately 1/210,000 of what will be the total ledger a few decades from now.

You could minimize third party trust by giving one half of the key (Shamir's secret sharing) to the heir and placing copies of the other half key in several different deadman's switch services. That way no service could take your money, and the heir would have no way of knowing which service you used or which account it was under, until they get the email upon your death. The only problem is one of the services might accidentally send the key to the heir prematurely. To avoid that you could divide it into more keys so that several services would have to all mess up, along with the heir coincidentally pulling a runner. Seems unlikely enough.

The value of a stock on Counterparty should never exceed the value of Bitcoin as a whole, for something akin to that very reason. A rational investor will see the asset as overvalued if it gets anywhere near Bitcoin's market cap, and short it. And while irrational investors might bid it unreasonably high for a brief time, the same could happen with Bitcoin, with the same risk of price getting ahead of mining (as has happened before).
This may mean that either Overstock will have to wait until Bitcoin has a larger market cap, or Overstock jumping in will cause the Bitcoin market cap to surge as well (this seems likely).

The arguments about "downward pressure" never made sense anyhow. People do portfolio allocation, usually maintaining their bitcoin holdings at probably 70-90% of their assets if they invested heavily at the start and if the price has jumped at least tenfold since they got in. 
The actual percentages aren't important, but every person should have a certain ratio they strive to maintain, and it seems most people do. Whether selling or spending, if their bitcoin allocation drops too low they will buy more to bring it back into their preferred range.

It might get cheaper for a while, or it might not. The question you as an investor need to answer is whether it will ultimately go up. Successful investors don't buy at the exact bottom. They buy whenever they know an asset is undervalued by the market and will eventually go up. Do you think the price will be lower or higher in two years? I think it'll be above $10,000, personally, based on its historical growth rate and future promise and pace of new innovations. You should read up and draw your own conclusions.

As I understand it, it's fairly trivial to prove how many coins you have access to in cold storage. I believe you can even do it without making a transaction, by signing a message with the private key(s). It seems like something that could be done at least daily without being too burdensome in most cases.
Now of course proving reserves doesn't prove solvency or that the company won't run away with the funds, but proof that they at least do have the coins and aren't screwing up their cold storage is a huge step and in many cases would only take a few minutes per proof.

OK, but it seems [spinoffs]( can perform the same function without any kind of fork or merge mining. I'd be more convinced sidechains are a useful/necessary idea if everyone on the sidechain project demonstrably understood spinoffs (and their economics, including the idea of money as a ledger) yet still chose to work on sidechains, but I'm not sure that's the case - simply because few people do and the economics are pretty counterintuitive.

I'm not a fan of the explanation of bitcoins as units of account, because this leaves people wondering why they are valuable at all.

With friends at school, yes. Not so much within my own family. A small tribe is like a large extended family. I'm thinking Dunbar's number, like 50 to a max of 150 people. In real world cooperative small community arrangements where everyone depends on each other and knows each other very well and also shares a much more consistent view on the value of things, the subjective internal memory ledger works fairly well compared with barter. 
Basically barter doesn't last long in the real world. It can't, when you think about it for a bit. Within just a few hours of trying to barter, you run into gigantic problems like double-coincidence of wants and non-divisibility. Historical accounts of barter make it sound like these systems persisted for some time, but even a day or two of serious business conducted by barter seems to be pushing it. It's simply an enormous problem if you can't get eggs from the egg-maker because all you have are cows, and he doesn't even want cows (let alone a fiftieth of one of your live cows). It's a non-starter.
Either a medium of exchange would have to be introduced, or memory would have to be used. Whichever it is, it would be taken up almost immediately. I'm guessing the larger the tribe size, the more likely a medium of exchange like gold or shells would come into use, simply because of how difficult memory would become at scale. 
That's why I'm very skeptical of the classic barter stories. That said, barter would have made sense *between* tribes since they might use different media of exchange, and if they used memory the trust relationship would not be there. So barter would make sense in certain inter-tribal cases.

What's the point of saving if you never spend? Ultimately a saver must become a spender, or else never enjoy their savings, and at that point they pay for the ride. 
Likewise, who are these spenders that never had to be holders, who never got that free ride of having the value of their daily spending money secured? 
The ambiguity in the term "saver" is causing problems. As should be clear from the above, everyone who ever uses Bitcoin is a "saver" for some amount of time. To disambiguate it, we could use the terms *temporary holder* and *long-term investor*. 
Investors benefit from the miner's work, but they're by no means getting a free ride at the miners' expense. In fact, they are keeping the miner in business by hoarding bitcoins and pushing the price up, increasing the value of the mining reward and the fees. Besides, they are taking on a great deal of risk - as this year has shown, this is no free ride for investors. Note that there are no investors in the future where the mining reward is small and Bitcoin is presumably mainstream, anyway. Only now, during the investment phase. In the future we are all talking about there are only...
...Temporary holders (that is, people transacting in bitcoin and saving whatever they don't spend for later, if anything). They get a free ride during the time they are holding the money, but the ride ends once they spend. 
So, where are the free riders?

Good. It's not really suitable as a transactional currency for everyday people yet, except in certain niche cases. The number of people who use Bitcoin to buy stuff can stagnate for at least another year or two before I'd start to worry. Bitcoin is first and foremost an investment right now.
While that investment is indeed based on the *future* promise of it becoming "the currency of the Internet," it's not there yet. The more merchant and consumer adoption the better, but more investment is orders of magnitude more important at this stage. Granted the two factors drive each other, but one is currently optional yet essential in the future, while the other is essential now.

I don't know about Medici specifically, but trusted data feeds providing information about the real world are what is necessary if Counterparty wants to create prediction markets, which are the holy grail in a sense because they enable everyone to take a position in (and influence*) any asset in the world, including for example Google stock without Google or NASDAQ's permission.

I don't get why so many people judge Bitcoin as if it were ready for prime time. It's not ready for prime time. The price has moved for four years primarily on the *future promise* of what Bitcoin will be useful for, not on what it's already useful for. That's the whole point of investing. The price has increased mainly because the likelihood of success, at least in people's minds, has risen. 
There was no demand for facebook when it started. There was latent demand for it, but people didn't know that it could benefit them, and most of the big benefits would only come once enough people were using it. 
With Bitcoin, it's like being able to use a very early facebook BUT ALSO invest in it. There's not yet many majorly life-touching things you can do with Bitcoin, for most people, but there promises to be in the future. Right now the main use case for most people in advanced countries is as an investment, if they have the required skills. One of those skills is realizing that the price is based on future promise far more than current utility, of which streamlining the shopping experience is pretty far down the list anyway.

If you think anything is really being destroyed, you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what Bitcoin is and how it works. It's not, as you may have been told, a collection of valuable tokens. It's a ledger. Each unit represents a *percentage* of the total money supply. Currently the term "one bitcoin" just means a little less than 0.00001% of the total money supply. You could burn millions of bitcoins and nothing would actually be lost or destroyed; it's just that the term "one bitcoin" would now refer to more like 0.001% or 0.0001% of the total money supply. Everyone else got richer, having received a hefty donation from the burner. 
Nothing was destroyed, just moved around. The burner's percentage of the money supply decreased, while everyone else's percentage of the money supply increased. The burner's purchasing power declined, while everyone else's rose.

If it's an agreement between two businesses, any advantage for one side can just be partially slid over to a concession for the other side in a negotiation, making both parties better off. 
Say your company contracts its manufacturing to a company in China. You'd save 4% if you could pay them in Bitcoin, and let's say they'd save 0%. You just offer them a concession in the contract that costs you 2% but saves them 2%, such as allowing them to use 2% cheaper packaging that incurs a 2% additional fee in import duties. Now you both save 2%. The Chinese company should be happy with the new Bitcoin arrangement because it saves them money.

Centralized currency has no need for a blockchain. Governments can simply maintain a centralized digital database logging every transaction. It would be much faster and better for their purposes. Moreover, predictable inflation rates ruin the whole point of central banks and the advantages they confer to bankers and governments. 
Not to mention that Bitcoin's main value isn't internet transactions or even remittances (governments could defeat that by making remittances cheaper, like in Europe, and USDcoin wouldn't help with the holdouts anyway), but rather its inability to be messed with by centralized powers. Governments have only two choices in creating Fedcoin: 1) retain control over money issuance, 2) relinquish control to a known schedule of issuance. 
In the first case, this provides no ultimate competition with Bitcoin. In the second case, it is essentially just like Bitcoin and if it succeeds the world will be an awesome place (but no major government will do this, of course).

Consider that even if you're completely right that OpenBazaar will add tremendous value to the Bitcoin ecosystem and boost the BTC price, which I think is likely the case, if the price has to wait on OpenBazaar to move upward it's going to be a long wait. At least several months before 1.0 is even released, and then probably quite a few more months, or maybe even a few years, before commerce on it gets huge. 
It'll likely be a big driver of the price, but by the time it really kicks in there should be a lot of other big things happening as well, such as ETFs, major merchants, way easier for everyday people to buy and hold and spend bitcoins, massively better mainstream understanding, etc.

This succinctly explains a large part of why to buy bitcoins even if you aren't one of the relatively few people who have a direct use for them (unless you consider investment a use). You buy because increasing numbers of other people have a use for it, and it snowballs.

Still savers aren't getting a free ride until they actually spend those coins, which will cost them fees for each transaction that constitutes the "ride." 
Here again I see an equivocation between talking about the situation currently, when "savers" means investors risking capital for a return, and many years in the future when presumably Bitcoin is mainstream and price is stable except for the small mining reward inflation, when "saver" means everyone, including those who transact, because you can't spend bitcoins without first holding them. There is certainly no free ride for investors, as the recent drop shows how difficult it is for people to ride the long-term bull market, and in the future everyone who uses Bitcoin is at first a saver by definition and they don't get any investment return for it. Every spender free rides, then pays at the end. So does every spender.
To be clear on the above, I'm saying that to make the argument you're making seems to require imagining we're in the present for half the argument and in the future for the other half. If we pick one, I find no free riders.

It's not a site. From a user perspective it's more akin to a browser. Each merchant, or at least their trust network, will form segregated sets of content. Unsavory things and trust relationships with anyone who has any connection, however indirect, with such things will be avoided by all mainstream merchants. It seems similar to the Internet before TOR diverted a lot of the worst content, or like Usenet newsgroups in their heyday. Professors and students still used newsgroups heavily for academic discussion despite the fact that questionable content was accessible through the very same system.

This same misunderstanding (the idea that slicing a pie into more/fewer pieces gives you more/less pie) was used against returning to gold as money: "It may have worked in the 1800s, but now the economy is much bigger and there's not enough gold to go around."
It's also why people tend to equate printing money with creating wealth, and burning bitcoins with destroying wealth. All these things just change how wealth is distributed, or if you like, how the pie is sliced up.

It's because Bitcoin is still primarily valued as an investment. The use of bitcoins to make purchases is more just a consequence of already being invested in them; few people are in Bitcoin just to make their shopping experience easier (black market users are the main exception). 
This isn't a bad thing, it's just how a new asset ledger is bootstrapped into global prominence. Investment now serves as a proxy for actual consumer/merchant adoption, anticipating that demand in the future. The more we can get people to use and spend bitcoins the better, but the key indicator now and for the next 2-3 years is investment.

The unit price of "1 bitcoin" is completely arbitrary. What "1 bitcoin" really means is 1/13,000,000 of the current total money supply.

Yes, to a completely arbitrary rate set based on a number pulled out of thin air by Satoshi as a temporary measure. 
It's not valid to argue against increasing the blocksize limit by saying miners should get "more" in fees, because that argument proves too much: it proves the blocksize limit should be *reduced* (unless someone wants to argue that Satoshi's shot in the dark hit it exactly on the bullseye, and not only that but for all time).

The hyperbole is being condoned by many here because the idea seems to be to present the greatest opposition to the BitLicense regs.

Indeed, people misunderstand Andreas's point about it being a "theoretical" attack. It's not theoretical because the incentives don't align, as most seem to be saying. It's theoretical because it assumes that during an 51% *attack* (not just a 51% share situation) everyone just carries on and doesn't notice or react. Like many oversimplified economic arguments, it neglects that its subjects are people and tend to react differently once an *actual threat* presents itself, versus just a potential danger.
I've never seen an argument beyond the highly hypothetical in which a 51% attack represents anything more than a temporary disruption at most, and an extremely expensive temporary disruption at that.

In a dollar devaluation scenario, the thought is that two things would happen at once:
1) People would run to Bitcoin, increasing its price *in every currency* (and vs. gold, etc.).
2) The dollar would of course be worth less, further inflating the bitcoin price *in dollars*.
For example, if the bitcoin price grows 20x in gold, rubles, and yen while the dollar devalues to half, the bitcoin price in dollars would reach $20,000, not just $10,000. (But the value would only be $10,000 per bitcoin in today's dollars.)
So dollar inflation is good for Bitcoin not merely in the notional sense.

Even putting gold under your mattress is freeing up capital (labor and materials) for others to use, versus if you had spent the gold - on massages, toys, architectural design services, etc. By living more frugally and not drawing the labor away from the masseuse, the steel and plastic and shipping container space used for the toys, and the design hours of the architect, you free up these resources for other people to use. You're essentially investing in the entire rest of the economy, by "hoarding."

This is the same economic fallacy commited by Peter Schiff in his dismissal of Bitcoin because it's "infinitely divisible," just in a different form. The price will be determined by supply and demand: total supply of XCP vs. total interest by investors. You could have the valuation you mentioned if the total supply of XCP were set very low, but as we all know (except Peter Schiff and maybe some shibes) the total number of units of a coin is entirely arbitrary. However, *given* a certain total number of coins, a definite price will emerge.

Actually someone in society did ask for the loan. Whoever paid AnalWithAGoat for goods/services received a loan of resources, while AnalWithAGoat only received a bunch of vouchers that society agrees can be used for claiming resources in the future. 
And then, in turn, other people in society asked for loans of resources from the people AnalWithAGoat loaned to. This ripples through society. Later AnalWithAGoat can, under this memory system called "Money" that pretty much everyone in society adheres to, use those vouchers to obtain actual resources again. Assuming a hard money system, if society becomes more productive in general - in part thanks to that loan of resources from AnalWithAGoat -  those vouchers can claim more resources. The investment appreciated; the loan paid interest.

Right. Many people buy mining equipment as a cheaper way of buying bitcoins, because it often is (if you know what you're doing). 
But that means, at least among people who understand mining or are willing to learn, that those who are interested in taking a position in BTC have two choices: buy bitcoins directly OR buy mining equipment. Within that sphere, then, what happens is they either push the difficulty higher or push the BTC price higher, depending on if they spend their money on mining rigs or directly on bitcoins. 
Therefore if the BTC price is falling while difficulty is skyrocketing, a significant portion of the price drop should be discounted. Take a close look at this chart of [difficulty versus price](

What was email's advantage for the average Joe in 1994? Basically none, because no one they knew used it.
Except in niche situations, Bitcoin's only "advantage" to the average Joe at this time is as an investment. That's what is meant when people say that Bitcoin is in the very early adopter phase. The average Joe can use it for non-investment purposes, but it won't likely be particularly helpful to them until later when more people are using it. Just like email.
Investment based on the prospect of future adoption by more people is what drives it in the meantime.
I'd also add that the reason this question keeps coming up is because of the faulty way Bitcoin is marketed, as "the currency of the Internet" instead of "the best candidate for the future currency of the Internet."

Power law distributions are inevitable in any system.
EDIT: Even if you could airdrop an equal portion of all the bitcoins on every person in the world, which would be the fairest possible distribution, most people would have sold at the first doubling of price. (Think about it.) And with each doubling, exponentially fewer people would remain, with the people who understood and believed in Bitcoin soon emerging as huge holders. 
Of course even they would need balls forged of iron to retain those huge stashes they were initially able to buy when everyone scoffed at them, since the same mortal risks would have existed all the way up. Anyone who holds 99% of their net worth in Bitcoin knowing that a simple hack of the system could reduce their net worth by 99%, from say being a millionaire to being a ten-thousandaire, for years and years of insane volatility, deserves every bitcoin they can keep, in my opinion. 
Several statistical analyses have mentioned that the average holder retains only 83% of their bitcoins after each doubling. I don't know if that is accurate, but a quick look at incentives suggests something in that ballpark would be sensible portfolio balancing for people who are very confident in the "binary bet." That would mean only something like 400 of the original 10,000 bitcoins are likely to be retained by the people who ordered one of the fabled Papa John's pizzas for Laszlo Hanyecz all those years ago. That's a nice return, but hardly an insane reward for holding tight all these years while most people laughed and jeered from the sidelines.

The cost of being in control of the 1% forever is not ever getting to spend the money. Either that or being a highly savvy investor or entrepreneur, but in that case you'd end up near the top no matter what the initial distribution. 
The only reason the ultra-wealthy that have little to contribute to society manage to stay on top in the fiat world is through leveraging government power. A Bitcoin-powered world doesn't have that option. If you got rich in bitcoin by pure luck and have no financial talent, you can only keep that wealth to the extent you're willing to live a relatively humble life well beneath your means.

You deserve it not "because you own it" but because you forwent consumption, letting everyone else consume first. Now you're afforded additional consumption for having given people that privilege in the past. 
For example, you could buy a car now for $20,000 or you could hoard the money and wait until next year when the car is 10% cheaper/better. By hoarding, you have contributed to society by making one additional car available to the rest of society than there would have been otherwise, for one year, and now you are effectively calling in that favor. You let other people have cars slightly more cheaply (by not bidding up the average price with your own purchase), then you get the benefits of the economic growth *that you invested in.*
Effectively hoarding money is like holding shares of an index fund covering the entire economy. You "deserve" the growth in your purchasing power because you invested in the growth of the economy (and in this case your investment appreciated).

As it should. Under a money system that isn't manipulated, X% deflation actually sends a useful message to the entrepreneur: "the average economic growth is X% per year, so if a given investment you are considering cannot create an X% annual increase in value, it is a bad investment. You should either look for a higher return investment or just save the money so that other people's money will be temporarily more valuable and they - who are better at finding growth investments than you! - will make more of their superior investments to grow society's wealth rather than your inferior ones."
In other words, it tells entrepreneurs that the average employment of capital in the economy is producing an X% value increase for society (the same quantity of money chasing X% more goods and services). If you can't beat that, save your money and find a different job because you're not very good at employing capital. Likewise, if a given capital investment can't beat that, it is a poor use of capital and will make society (and you!) poorer than if you had simply saved the money (a loan to everyone else) or invested the money elsewhere (a lone to a more efficient entrepreneur).

The real answer is, it isn't low right now; it's very high, up 4000% in 18 months. What other asset can claim such spectacular growth? But it is starting to get low compared to the historical trend (average of 10x increase per year), which suggests a great buying op.

The difference is you don't need more than one major ledger for commerce. If a different system of ledger maintenance is superior, even faster block times, the logical thing to do would be to integrate it into THE ledger (the Bitcoin ledger of course), not start a bran new ledger. This could be done either with a hard fork or, if no consensus can be reached, it can be done with a spin-off (alt-protocol using the same ledger so that the private keys to each bitcoin address also automatically have access to a proportional amount of the "new coin").

It's just a fact of human psychology that people's confidence in an investment is highly influenced by short-term price fluctuations. Either they study enough to overcome that instinct, or they are later ecstatic when the price rises. Or they sell into this correction and slap themselves when the price rises, and eventually buy at the next top in the quintuple digits. 
Panickiness, whether out of greed or fear, is an extremely unfortunate trait for an investor to have. Especially when it's based solely on price movements.

Relatively few, yes, compared to the number of holders. And that's really as it should be right now.

Proof of burn **is** proof of donation. It's a donation to everyone else in the Bitcoin community proportional to how much they hold.
As an example, if you burned half of all the bitcoins in existence, each bitcoin in everyone else's possession would be worth twice as much. To someone with $20,000 in Bitcoin it'd be a $20,000 donation.
@_date: 2014-09-05 03:52:54
The trust imputation system in the whitepaper is designed to do just that. Proof of burn is only needed insofar as people have no clout or trust in the community (i.e., no one will impute trust to them).
Proof of burn shouldn't seem anti-natural, other than the name (sounds like you're destroying something valuable*). It's the most natural possible thing to do to establish goodwill in an economic community: proof of donation to everyone else in the community.
*Imagine you're splitting a pizza equally among 5 friends. The pizza is to be cut into fifths. But actually you decide not to have any, so now the pizza is cut into four pieces for the remaining four people. Did any pizza go to waste? You "burned" your slice, so there are less slices to go around, right? The world has one less pizza slice, such a shame...right? No! A bitcoin (or a bar of gold) is just a slice of the available money supply. Destroying it destroy's no actual resources or capital in society, it just makes the value of each unit go up as there are fewer bitcoins chasing the same supply of goods and services. 
Donating a slice is being a bro!

The method of taxation is relevant. Consider: why are there taxes on everything instead of just a few huge taxes on a few things? One reason is to catch more people in the net, but another big reason is that taxing one particular thing too much would destroy the economy. It has to be spread around to enable the maximum extraction of rent from the general public. Removing certain channels for taxation should result in somewhat lower overall taxation. (And the inflation "tax" is indeed the most insidious as it appears to most people to be coming from somewhere else than the government.)

Not altcoins, alt-ledgers. 
We already have a ledger we like, but some may be interested in trying an alt-protocol (say one with Litecoin's hashing function, or Monero's anonymity) that operates on the same initial Bitcoin ledger state. That is, an "altcoin" that is automatically distributed to all bitcoin holders in the exact same proportions and is accessible with the private keys to holders' addresses. 
For example, if you had 1% of all bitcoins, you'd by default also have 1% of all the litecoins, spendable with the same set of private keys. If you had no interest in the alt-protocol, you could immediately sell them off. Otherwise, if you did nothing, you'd be a holder by default. That way the ledger would be preserved by default, and if it ever became necessary to "jump ship" to another protocol, that could be done *without also having to start with a completely new ledger*.
That's way less threatening for Bitcoin holders. If an altcoin wants to be anything other than a pump-and-dump, it should be rolled out as an alt-protocol, not a bran new ledger. (Premines aren't necessary for funding, since devs can accumulate from the initial dumpers to secure a motivating stake, they themselves being in the best position to assess the future of that alt-protocol.)

One of the main problems is that the "Bitcoin is real money!" angle, which was needed in order to attract initial investors, has now outlived its usefulness.

Source? Because this is not self-evident.
Every bitcoin spender is also a bitcoin investor. As an investor, they want a certain percentage of their portfolio to be in bitcoins. The more spending bitcoins puts them below that percentage, the greater incentive to buy them back. And if they're spending while they're above the target percentage, they're merely spending to rebalance instead of selling to rebalance. 
Either way I don't see any net-negative effect on the price, and of course over the medium- to long-term the effect is positive.

At this point, you'd have already identified a certain targeted  percentage of your total portfolio assets to be in bitcoins. If you were over or under this percentage, you'd adjust the percentage of bitcoin/fiat in your paycheck as needed to rebalance.
For example, if you target 80% BTC and 20% fiat, and you now have only 70% BTC, you might request the next paycheck to be 90% BTC or even 100% BTC. And if you now have 90% BTC, you might request 50/50 for the next paycheck to deweight your bitcoin holdings back toward 80%.

If an early adopter's bitcoins take up too large a proportion of their portfolio at $370, those bitcoins took up wayyy too large a proportion of their portfolio at $1200. For the argument to work, you have to explain why they irrationally refused to rebalance their portfolio last November instead of now. (And panic selling isn't an option: remember if they are early adopters they had to have held through the huge 2011 drop where the price fell to one twentieth what it was. This correction is tiny in comparison.)

That's more a concern for the pool ecosystem since they're painting a bullseye on their own heads.

And that would still be fine, or almost fine. It's still a pretty great gain. But yeah, if it goes much lower than that for much longer, the argument starts wearing thin and *then* would be the time to start positing theories of why the price is doing strange things. Right now it's not strange, compared to the past.
Take a look at the [historical chart]( We're nowhere near any kind of shockingly low trough yet. Personally if we go below the April 2013 high of $266 I'd start wondering what the heck was going on. The price now is completely unsurprising. I've been saying since the beginning of 2014 that it could well be a slack year, after 100x growth last year. And due to market psychology, a slack year (a long time!) inevitably means some depressing drops - it wouldn't just hold near $1000 for the whole year.
But again, look at the historical chart. There's nothing remotely unprecedented about this level of dip.

If Counterparty ever gets so popular that that becomes a problem, I'm sure they'll find a way to manage.

That should keep the price low but non-trivial.

This is a major point most people still don't understand: it makes no sense to look at the BTC price alone as the current indicator of market confidence in Bitcoin. The indicator that matters is the total amount of money flowing into the ecosystem, be it through buys on exchanges, venture capital inflows, the manufacture and purchase of mining equipment, or people buying fewer bitcoins than they would have in order to support themselves as they quit their jobs or reduce their hours to work on Bitcoin projects and startups. 
Each channel for capital inflow takes turns in a feast-famine cycle. Although the price is in a famine this year, all the other channels are feasting with wild abandon. As these channel gorge themselves to their saturation points, the price channel takes its seat at the dinner table once again. Only if the table starts to look empty should fears of Bitcoin losing favor with investors arise.

You make this sound unprecedented, but that is far from the case:
In 2011 the price went up 32x then fell 16x lower (to a sixteenth of its peak). Last year the price rose 100x and has so far fallen less than 4x lower (a quarter of its peak). Sure the timescale is a little longer this time, but the price differentials between gain and loss are nowhere near as big. Keep in mind Bitcoin is still up 3x year on year, even if down 3x on the calendar year. Cherry picking the date is fine for propaganda but tells us nothing in actual analysis.

There are only two possible cases: 1) spenders are buying the coins back, 2) spenders are not buying the coins back. If they buy back there is no price impact. If they don't buy back, we have to ask why they spent in the first place. 
Case 1 is clearly dismissed. Within Case 2 there are three sub-cases: 2a) They spent because they felt they were holding too many bitcoins, meaning they are spending in lieu of selling, meaning no price impact; 2b) They spent even though they felt they were holding the exact right amount of bitcoins, meaning now they feel they have too few, meaning they will feel pressure to buy more even if not immediately, meaning no price impact beyond the short term; 2c) They spent even though they felt they were holding too few bitcoins already, meaning they will feel even bigger pressure to buy back, even sooner, which is again no impact beyond the short term. 
In all case price impact is neutral from this effect, except short term blips. And of course there is latent positive price pressure thanks to good PR and Bitcoin becoming more useful.

In order to see the answer to your question, you have to understand dishoarding rates. 
With the large appreciation of bitcoin value over the months and years, people's bitcoin holdings soon start to account for a huge percentage of their portfolios. Anyone who's been in Bitcoin for over 18 months knows this conundrum: "This is getting to be huge money and if the price goes to zero I'm back to being poorish but if I sell too much along the way I'll never be rich, so how much should I sell?"
You quickly realize you have to sell some along the way just to maintain sanity and prudence. But...you don't actually have to sell. Instead you can buy stuff with your bitcoins. It seems on average people sell something like 17% of their bitcoins for every time the price doubles, once their holdings reach what they deem "big money." 
A lot of the sales we're seeing are just that 17% being diverted to purchases instead of sales for fiat. And of those people who don't do it that way, many of them repurchase - the goal is to maintain that 80-90% bitcoin portfolio. If you spend them so much that you now only have 70% bitcoins and 30% other assets (dollars, etc.), you'll want to repurchase some coins on exchange; likewise if the price goes up so much that you have 95% bitcoins and only 5% other assets you'll want to either sell some coins or spend them somewhere.
Note again that this the situation for most people who've been in Bitcoin for at least 18 months (and many who've been in for even a year).

While I'm wary of pinning all hopes and dreams on Circle, it does stand to reason that a significant cost savings in the community of overseas workers could spread like wildfire, the method now being dirt simple.

The particular stream of money flowing into the Bitcoin space that put $500 million into infrastructure this year could have instead, had the circumstances been different, put that same $500 million directly into bidding the price up. Cypherdoc (a well-known investor on bitcointalk, has alluded to a theory of different "buckets" in the bitcoin economy, as if money coming into the space is at different times channeled into different buckets labeled Mining, Venture Capital, and of course Bitcoin Price. As each overflows the money gets channeled into the others. 
There seems to be a pretty good case to be made that Bitcoin's exponential growth looks a lot smoother if, instead of looking at the price only, you look at all the buckets collectively. For example this year Price bucket is getting very little inflow but the Mining and Venture Capital buckets are getting a ton.

The bet on the decentralized prediction market is completely decentralized, including all the payouts and even the "cut" to the data providers for their valuable service. There is no way for someone to charge obscene profits there, because there are no barriers to entry. The prices for each service will float down to their marginal cost of provision.

Note that economically the first thing we would expect to happen if blockspace "runs out" is for miners to charge more in fees. For a certain amount of time, which could in theory be quite long, people who were taking advantage of low fees to send a lot of low-priority transactions will find more efficient ways or stop the low-priority transactions altogether because they won't be profitable with the higher fees. This would make room for more transactions in the meantime. 
Consider that if fees were extremely high we'd have plenty of blockspace, since people would only send transactions when they really needed to. The problem would be the high fees. 
So the problem should be seen not as "we're running out of blockspace," but rather "we're running out of cheap blockspace." The failure scenario should be something more like fees getting too high, rather than people not being able to push through their important transactions. (This does assume that miners and transactors communicate well enough and fast enough for a price adjustment system to develop, whether this is via the client or some other means.)

Manufacturing can't easily use idle/surplus resources, but mining can. 
Another example in the same vein is Storj, which uses idle disk space. You could argue that major warehouses full of raid arrays will dominate Storj and it won't be profitable to rent out your own empty disk space as an average person, but if it's easy enough that may not be the case.

No capital is being destroyed. It's just being moved around. Neither would capital be created if the coins were somehow unburned. Money is not capital; it's a claim on capital. Reducing the number of claims leaves the actual capital unchanged, but makes each claim more valuable. It's a donation to everyone else, as Satoshi explained.

This myth is really persistent. There could be a very short-term effect, but for most holders Bitcoin is first and foremost an investment, and as an investment people want to maintain a certain percentage of their portfolio in bitcoins, say 80%. A new merchant accepting Bitcoin might prompt some purchases of must-have items, decreasing someone's investment portfolio from 80% to 75% Bitcoin. Maybe that person won't be bothered to re-buy bitcoins in order to bring their holding back up to 80%, but there's a limit to it, especially if the bitcoin price is falling (making it more and more attractive to buy back, from a long-term investor's perspective).
At this point, since Bitcoin is still vastly more useful to most holders as an investment than a shopping facilitator, merchant adoption serves mainly as a release valve for people wanting to lighten their Bitcoin holdings as the price grows (if they want 80% bitcoin but the price growth makes their portfolio 95% bitcoin, they want to sell some - or purchase something), as well as very good PR.

Consider 2011 when the price went up 30fold and down 16fold then over the next two years went up 600fold. Any possible unfairness in initial distribution has to have been obliterated by such gyrations: only those who had extreme faith in Bitcoin held through the falls and bought the nadirs and held through the rises despite their capital risk growing to otherwise-considered-insane levels. Those people deserve every satoshi. The extreme volatility ensures that Bitcoin distribution isn't any less fair than the wealth distribution of the world now, and actually a lot fairer since it isn't automatically tied with real world power.

You're actually right in a sense: it's possible for Horrible Regulation A to be mitigated by Amelioratory Regulation B.

Regulation should be provided by the market, not a monopoly decider.

The problem with the NAP is that everyone defines aggression in their own way. In fact, the nuances of each person's definition of aggression are what forms the parameters of their ideology. 
Voluntaryism has the same problem. What is voluntary? To fully answer the question entails nothing less than recreating the entire customary/common law, the law merchant, and everything else that evolved in a natural order process to reduce disputes in society.
If the NAP/Voluntaryism is going to end up doing that anyway, it's an oversimplifying distraction, reinventing the wheel in exactly the way Mises and Hayek both earned about: with the mindset of a central planner, falling prey to the fatal conceit that one person or group can out-think the market.

I think a more generalized argument can be made that, because securing the network against attackers is fundamentally adversarial, Bitcoin mining is not wasteful at all. Although the precise resource usage varies, it tends toward being exactly as expensive as it needs to be to provide a level of security commensurate with how valuable the market considers the network to be. Since there is no centralized authority and no barrier to entry in determining the "truth" of the Bitcoin ledger, if it were cheaper to secure, it would necessarily be cheaper to attack.
Even assuming this argument is somehow flawed, as of now there has nevertheless been no proven method of securing the network more cheaply, so Bitcoin PoW cannot coherently be called wasteful - it's performing an incredibly useful function in the cheapest known way.

It's just the economic law of supply and demand. Market sentiment being whatever it is, reduced supply results in a higher price than what it would have been. 
As for buried gold, it affects the market exactly the same way that simple hoarding does: it increases the price versus if the gold had not been hoarded/buried. It's just that burying it is more permanent. 
With proof of burn, the effect is absolutely permanent *and* everyone has access to that information. For example, if you were the first person to notice that 6 million bitcoins just got burned, you'd be a fool if you didn't immediately go long Bitcoin. All else being equal, the price would double before long.
Quite contrary to this being an unknown factor, it actually gives the most reliable market data possible: perfect information of bitcoins that will be permanently off the market. Sure, no one will ever know how many *other* bitcoins have been lost for other reasons, but the ones that are burned are provably off the market and provide a completely solid basis for analysis.

Even huge opportunistic mining farms exert zero overall pressure on the price, except short term.

Mr. Billionaire decides he needs a giant catastrophic grain reserve, so he buys up 10% of the global wheat supply. Now every loaf of bread you buy is 10% more expensive since wheat is 10% scarcer.

Note: Exponential growth means constant *percentage* growth. A 20x increase followed by another 20x increase is exponential. But anyway the historical chart indicates 10x per year growth. Since last year was 100x, it'd be reasonable to expect to end this year flat, at $1000. 100x one year and flat the next year is the same as two years of 10x growth each. But of course nothing in the mid to high hundreds or low thousands would be surprising, given natural variance. 
Either way, the historical chart indicates $10,000 by the end of 2015, though given the volatility it could easily be anywhere from 10K to 100K by the end of 2015 or 2016.

If it's merge mined, the block times are the same, so it couldn't be any faster, right?
If it's not merge mined, miners are paid in a third non-pegged coin (since new pegged coins can't arise without additional bitcoins being locked), which seems to have little use as it doesn't benefit from the network effects.
I think more clarification about how mining a sidechain would actually work is still needed. Perhaps sidechains can only really be effectively used by something like Counterparty that rides on top of Bitcoin itself and therefore needs no miners of its own to confirm transactions. (Note that Counterparty was launched with a one-way peg, where bitcoins were locked forever. As a sidechain it could be a two-way peg.)

The government loves it because it lets them spend more money, and bankers love it because it profits them tremendously. It is the very organizational distillation of the old maxim that "power corrupts."

Money flow into the Bitcoin space remains very strong, but this year it's going into startups (and mining rigs) instead of toward bidding up the BTC price. That's because last year the price rose too far too fast and reached a temporary saturation point where people felt they could get more bang for their investment buck by starting or investing in businesses and/or mining equipment. 
Mining is now reaching a temporary saturation point, and perhaps the startup space (and especially the altcoin space) is starting to get there as well. Assuming the stream of cash flowing into the space continues apace, it will have nowhere to go but into directly buying bitcoins again, inducing the next price run-up.

People don't want to help others through a highly inefficient and corrupt system, but they're usually a lot more open to providing direct help where they think it's needed. Unfortunately everyone thinks that's the government's job. But more than that, governments have raised prices and lowered competition in every industry related to basic human needs. Without that influence there would be a lot less charity needed.

I'm a little wary of sidechains still. They are exciting but it's too early to pin hopes on them, and I haven't yet seen an explanation that makes me comfortable with the potential hazards. Since the quaint old days of Litecoin, altcoin proponents and others who missed out on being a super-early adopter of Bitcoin have gotten more and more sophisticated in their attempts to dethrone Bitcoin. I don't know how many people really understand sidechains enough to be sure this isn't going to be another launchpad for such ploys, especially given the financial incentives.

There are many problems with calling Bitcoin inflationary. Foremost is that it's not a currency yet anyway, and by the time Bitcoin does become a currency it won't be inflating much anymore. Besides that, the inflation is different from central bank inflation in two major ways: 1) it is completely predictable and subject to the whims of no one, hence it can be planned for easily, and 2) the new money isn't distributed to any politically favored groups or corporations who can spend the money before it has had a chance to bid up prices throughout the economy ([Cantillon Effects]( benefiting them at everyone else's expense.

This whole stock exchange thing is cool but I think it's missing the point. 
One way to take over the stock markets is to outcompete them, so that eventually Amazon and Google will be forced to list on the Bitcoin-based stock exchange as well, and eventually people will stop using the centralized exchanges.
A better way, I think, is to assimilate them. Anyone can see the price of stocks on the global markets and publish them in a price feed as an oracle. With enough oracles with reputation, perhaps with assistance from OpenBazaar's identity and trust system, reliable data on outside markets can be obtained for use in smart contracts. With a betting market like Counterparty enables, every piece of outside data is a handle that lets you influence how that data moves. With stock share data, this enables synthetic shares of stock to be traded, which means anyone can gain exposure to any stock in the world. Not only that, but they can also influence its value on the centralized stock exchanges. 
For example, say Amazon shares are trading at $100 on NASDAQ. This data is republished on cryptographic feeds signed by various oracles in a form that can be imported directly into smart contract payouts. On the betting market you can then create a bet that the price of Amazon will be higher tomorrow at 10:00 EST, or even a sliding bet that pays out more the higher the price is over $100 at that time, with a set of oracles specified for grabbing the actual NASDAQ price at that time. 
Then you can go long on Amazon by betting the price will rise, or go short by taking the other side of the bet. The really cool thing is that, once the decentralized betting market is large enough, the position of the betting market (longs vs. shorts) actually pushes the Amazone stock price up or down on the NASDAQ as well, because of arbitrage. That is, anyone who operates in both markets can make money if there are any disparities between the betting market's synthetic NASDAQ:Amazon price and the actual Amazon price on the NASDAQ exchange, bidding the prices closer and closer together. If the prices are far apart, the arbitrage profit is huge, so many people will do this, secretly of course. Since the betting market can be used anonymously just like Bitcoin, no one can know who the arbitrageurs are. Anyone can then buy and influence the Amazon share price without Amazon or NASDAQ'S permission.

It's not just "price vs. usage," but "all the money entering the Bitcoin ecosystem vs. usage" that is revealing.
Bitcoin has this interesting dynamic where making money off BTC price appreciation doesn't always mean buying bitcoins directly. For many at certain times, it means buying mining equipment. For others it means starting a miner manufacturing business. And for others it means investing millions in Bitcoin-related startups. For still others it means quitting their job and using their savings (which they otherwise would have invested into BTC) to support themselves while they work on Bitcoin projects full time. Depending on the conditions and your expertise, any one of these could at times be a more efficient way of getting bitcoins. For example, you may end up with more bitcoins if you spend $50,000 on starting a business in the ecosystem than if you just bought that many bitcoins. Or you may make more money if you spend it on mining equipment, provided you have the expertise required. 
The point is, what should be compared is usage vs. the total money flowing into the Bitcoin space, and only if certain conditions are met is this money flow reflected substantially in the price. The conditions would be, for example, the startup and mining sectors becoming saturated. Then the full force of those exponentially increasing fresh flows of fiat hit the exchanges directly.

I don't get the perception of WTFness in the price right now. For several years it's been a common idea that "Bitcoin goes up about 10x per year on average." It went up 100x last year, so stagnating this year seems like an unsurprising scenario.

It really doesn't matter how you do it, because the investment proposition is always the same: people will only risk their hard-earned money on something very very unlikely to succeed if it will pay out very very big returns if it does succeed. Any watering down of the returns that is sufficient to keep early adopters from becoming rich will result in very little investment.

It occurred to me a while ago that people don't vote unless they believe their vote could be the one that pushes the result over the edge. In a standard assurance contract or threshold crowdfunding, the bigger the donation drive the less chance of that happening, so the less motivation to contribute. But with voting, insofar as the candidate choices stay in very close contention, even very big campaigns can be swayed by a single voter with some low but significant chance. Pitting parts of the audience against one another is the key (and perhaps there is even another way besides voting that will accomplish this).
The art of it would be to provide choices that ended up as close to 50/50 in popularity as possible.

Probably not, though there surely are some. For example, many people tend to believe that events will happen even faster than they actually do. Another fallacy is people often entertain in support of Bitcoin is the availability fallacy, where since they read about Bitcoin all day they tend to start ascribing world events to things happening in the Bitcoin space that couldn't realistically be having such an effect yet - like eBay policy changes being brought on by OpenBazaar developments.
However, the question that overwhelmingly needed answering was why so many people were so pessimistic about Bitcoin over the years even as it went up a million percent, not the other way around. Also, cognitive biases in favor of Bitcoin are often pointed out by critics, as well as by other Bitcoin proponents because they want the arguments to be as solid as possible.

Theymos also claims more than half of the money is from ad revenue, in which case he can do whatever he wants with that half. But the much larger factor is, due to immense price appreciation in Bitcoin, when he received the donations their value was much, much lower. He could have sold the coins right away, but instead chose to hold them as bitcoins. (He would presumably not have been lambasted for liquidating them upon receipt, for a tiny fraction of what they are now worth. What if he had sold the coins for gold and their value had halved instead of going 10x or 100x? If he would be criticized for that, he should be praised for his wildly successful asset management.)
In my opinion, his decision to grow the donations' value many times over by leaving them in Bitcoin means that by far most of the value has been created by him himself, by his investment decision not to liquidate. If he is held accountable for any portion of those funds, it should only be whatever tiny percentage represents the value at the time the donations were made (and should exclude ad revenue). 
The question, then, is not whether these programmers are worth $300K/per year, but more like are they worth 30K, or maybe even 3K.

It's possible, but you need reliable oracles. In BitShares the oracles are provided through the DPOS system.

Let's imagine a scenario where Bitcoin gets stuck in niche uses with no compelling reason for most people to use it. Once it saturates those niche uses, its price should stabilize as there is no more upside since by hypothesis it is stuck. But a stable price really makes it look silly to hold gold instead of bitcoins, since then Bitcoin has almost every advantage in the store of value function that gold bugs seek. But replacing a large part of the gold market makes Bitcoin enormous in terms of market cap, and allows for many other uses not possible today. The ubiquity certainly would allow for pretty cheap and frictionless remittance, which gives another huge set of people the motivation to use it. 
But here's where the magic happens. Think of the community of Bitcoin holders and users as an economic bloc, or as a virtual city. Any business that operates entirely within that city gets to experience the full benefits of Bitcoin: for example, not just cheaper remittances but almost free remittances with zero hassle since there is no need to go through fiat money at all. Frictionless transactions for everything. This is a city many businesses will want to "move to" simply because it's more profitable. At first it might only be manufacturers paying suppliers overseas in Bitcoin but dealing in fiat money with customers (B2B aspect is entirely in the city, but B2C remains outside). This accretes step by scarcely noticeable step, each one enabling things that were previously impossible, each one motivating more people to join the city and move more and more of their dealings under its umbrella. 
The question of whether Bitcoin (or at least something like it) will take over was, to my mind, answered quite a while ago, when it was not only clear that the endgame of everyone using Bitcoin would be an extremely compelling future, but that the snowball had already starting rolling down the hill. Even if no further innovation happens, I think Bitcoin is destined to replace gold, for example, simply because it offers advantages that gold cannot ever offer. There's just nothing conceptually standing in its way other than volatility, which eventually goes away whether it stays niche or goes mainstream. Now implementation is another matter, but your question of whether Bitcoin solves a real problem is a conceptual one.
EDIT: This also suggests a sub-dichotomy within those who object to Bitcoin on a conceptual basis: those who believe a world where everyone uses Bitcoin is not a desirable outcome, and those who merely believe that in the world as it is today Bitcoin adoption by a single individual provides little or no benefit to the average person, so that even if full mainstream adoption would be a great ideal it can never be reached since there is no motivation by the average person to take the necessary steps to get there.

Although this may be a minority opinion here, I've maintained that at this stage most bitcoin holders don't buy them in order to enable or facilitate purchases, but primarily as an investment. If that's true then the main reason to spend bitcoins (again, for most people) is to simplify the dishoarding process as the price grows. That is, as their bitcoin portfolio grows too heavy thanks to price increases, they need to sell some for fiat via a cumbersome and risky process involving either exchanges and bank wires or localbitcoins type sales. Whenever this need aligns with the need for an actual good or service, this debit card would come in handy, even with the fees.
In short, I argue that "paying in bitcoin" in terms of practical purposes for most people at this point simply means combining a portfolio rebalance with a purchase in an easy one-step process.

For most people here, either they think Bitcoin will be worth orders of magnitude more in a few years or they think it'll be worth nothing.
In light of this, for those people it is actually rational to buy in even when the price feels "high" if they haven't bought yet, and when the price falls it is then even more attractive. 
Unless of course you think a falling price 4x lower than its highs indicates something fundamental about the Bitcoin ecosystem...but looking at the historical price chart shows that this level of volatility is par for the course and hence the fall suggests nothing about the ecosystem at all.

"It isn't what you know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so." -Mark Twain(?)
Academics and especially economists are likely to be slow to understand Bitcoin just because they think they already understand money and Bitcoin doesn't fit into their conception. So they feel no obligation do research or ponder it independent from what their profs taught them.
F.A. Hayek would put the same idea in different terms: the pretense of knowledge is a greater obstacle to understanding than ignorance is.

People are so afraid of falling into the correlation=causation error that they miss the one of the most pervasive facts of human existence: that causation is only conceivable as a finer-grained set of correlations we have found to be reliable. 
At the most basic epistemological level, past performance is the only indicator of future performance; it's just that it's not only past performance of the investment asset that we must take into consideration but past performance of everything. 
When you drop your phone, how do you know it will fall down instead of falling upward? Is the Earth's pull "causing" it to fall toward the Earth? What would that even mean? The idea of gravity is itself only a correlation, a historical pattern we've noticed and found to be remarkably consistent. Who's to say tomorrow the Earth won't start pushing instead of pulling? Only the past. Only the historical chart, not just of Earth but of every object we've been able to observe. No one knows how this happens, but even if we had a decent theory of gravitation it would still be based on other more fundamental correlations.
It's not as simple as "correlation != causation" and "the future is unrelated to the past."

I assume Liu meant "no other digital currency *that matters* can claim that." In other words, altcoins are so obscure and small-time that they aren't even in the discussion, and to even include this little nod to them would greatly distract from the point.

It's not possible these days for people not to lose money in such a case. It was only possible for Bitcoin because no one valued crypto for anything yet and there was basically no speculation. The Counterparty guys have been very upfront from the beginning that the software is in alpha and you may lose all your money so don't put in more than chump change. People will choose to risk it anyway, in hopes of a payoff, because this isn't four years ago.

There seems to be a widespread perception that destroying coins is somehow related to destroying wealth. It's just a name; nothing is actually being destroyed in terms of real world wealth or purchasing power, but just being moved around. Proof of burn is actually proof of donation (to every other bitcoin holder, in proportion to how many bitcoins each person holds). 
 
Money is just a form of memory: it records, either in a low-tech way (gold/paper) or high-tech way (Bitcoin), who did what for whom in society. It's a kind of favor-voucher that you give to people who did something for you and you receive when you do something for someone else. Destroying your favor-vouchers of course doesn't hurt anyone else; in fact it makes everyone else's worth more. There are now fewer vouchers chasing the same amount of available favors (goods and services) in society, since one person - the voucher burner - was nice enough to throw away his right to collect goods and services from others.

You have willing sellers of weather data; what you need are willing buyers. 
People certainly need the data, yet most people don't need it in that form, but in the form of accurate weather forecasts. Prediction markets reign supreme as accurate forecasters, and decentralized prediction markets will be a reality as soon as trusted feeds can be relied on to publish data about the real world. The weather data from the network can provide this data, and as long as it can't be spoofed or altered, it can be used by smart contracts, such as Counterparty's contracts for difference (CFD), that function as bets on future weather conditions. 
For example, a bet that some weather condition will/won't prevail on a given day in NYC could be set up to pay out based on the data from nodes in the network you've created, with a small cut going to each of the nodes as incentive for them to provide the data (this involves a very big transaction since there will be thousands of recipients or more, but Bitcoin is good at this kind of thing). And of course, places where the weather matters more to more people and to wealthier businesses will have bigger bets with bigger payouts to the winners and the data providers, incentivizing more people in, say, NYC to provide the data so that places where weather matters more will get the most data coverage.
Note that this also enables weather insurance: just take the less probable side of the bet and you've taken out an insurance policy just like that. For example, 8.0 magnitude quake in Tokyo within the next month? Very unlikely, so if you bet that it will happen you'll likely lose, but the payoff will be huge - exactly like you want insurance to behave. But now the only middlemen getting a cut are those data providers on your network (I don't know if phone sensor data can be used to verify that an earthquake occurred, but you get the point).

The idea of machines buying stuff isn't usually presented in a way that has any revolutionary implications, even though it actually does. There's no reason for your fridge to buy its own food rather than it simply relaying information about what items are running low to your smartphone where either an app orders more food automatically or you vet the choices yourself. 
What's revolutionary about machines being able to transact is that they can *negotiate with other machines* in a way that was never possible before. It's a fundamental expansion of the scope of machine-to-machine interaction. It brings the [enormous benefits of trade]( to the machine world.
For example, without a means of transacting, self-driving cars would simply have to follow certain rules of the road that applied universally, where no car has any advantage over another in terms of getting to their destination quickly. With transactions enabled, cars in a hurry can negotiate with other cars to yield for a small fee. Rich passengers will pay for the convenience, and many poorer passengers will be happy to give up a few extra seconds for a cheaper ride.
The case in general is that every situation where machines, up to now, have had no means of negotiating priorities among each other becomes a situation where they do. Machines have always been able to establish priorities within themselves, optimizing everything according to the actual desires of their owners. The problem has been how to optimize priorities among machines with different owners. Until now, the best we could do was fairness, a level playing field for all machines. But the needs and financial means of each owner/renter are different. One person values time more, and one values money more. Now they can trade for their mutual benefit, and without even directly authorizing each trade. Instead they simply set their priorities and funding allowance and have the machine make whatever purchases are in harmony with those priorities.

Any Bitcoin address or wallet (set of addresses) can hold any amount of bitcoins, such as 27.884329 bitcoins. 1 bitcoin is just another word for 100 million satoshis, so there's nothing special about a "whole bitcoin." 
For Coinbase you just need whatever security arrangements you set up with the site (username, passwork, 2-factor authentication, etc.) to access the coins. If you send them to an address you created yourself, then you need to know your private key - and make sure no one else does.

Just like Bitcoin block space, asset namespace is a scarce resource. To critique Counterparty for having to deal with this is to level an analogous critique at Satoshi and all the Bitcoin devs so far for not yet creating some kind of automatic mechanism for updating max blocksize based on real world levels of scarcity in the relevant resources.
EDIT: This has been discussed since the beginning on the Counterparty forums, and there are many avenues for addressing it. Ultimately assets will probably be up for bidding initially for a set period before issuance, and perhaps at certain intervals thereafter. Since Counterparty can likely enable this bidding process natively it looks even more solvable. Perhaps Counterparty can even solve the blockspace issue through a similar mechanism.

When you have a lot of revolutionary and counterintuitive ideas to share with the world, there's great power in anonymity: if you put out all your ideas, or all the components of one big idea, under a single alias, people can reject it all by association. The hard-to-grasp, crazy-seeming ideas cast doubt on the rest, so that the only people who you can really have an effect on are those who are astute enough to understand all the ideas, or patient enough to withhold judgment on the ones that seem too wild. 
It's far better to just "spill memes" and release all the good ideas without any "name branding" so that they appear to come from nowhere, or better yet people end up thinking they thought of the idea themselves because they can't remember who said it.

Perhaps the hidden X factor in this discussion no one's talking about is how much they think the Bitcoin price will be upon mainstream adoption, and when that could happen. 
I personally think full mainstream adoption, where everyone uses Bitcoin for everything, means at least $10 million per bitcoin (in today's dollars), and quite possibly a few orders of magnitude more. And I guess this happens in 10 to 20 years. Then the price presumably stabilizes from there with light deflation as the economy grows.
~~52~~ **42** years from now, in 2056, the block reward is still 0.01 bitcoins every ten minutes, which by then should be around a million dollars. It seems that's parents argument that savers make the coins more valuable still holds a lot of force at that time. A sudden drop-off in the savings rate, though of course unlikely, could change that payout quite a lot. That means savers are contributing quite a lot to the miners even then. 
Or am I missing the whole idea here and we are talking about 2100? That just seems too far out to consider right now.

The quick overview is too detailed yet leaves the reader more confused about what Bitcoin actually is. 
First the fundamental description:
* Bitcoin is an accounting ledger distributed over a network of computers that use a mathematical mechanism to ensure that everyone's copy of the ledger matches and no one can cheat. 
The basic functions (money and payment system) and improvements over the current system should flow directly from that. Then briefly mention the novel future applications.

The dev team, being in the best position to know whether OB will succeed, will likely burn a fair amount of their coins as an investment in the system. If the platform takes off, their burned-in reputations will be worth millions or billions of dollars. The devs will be well fed if this takes off, but only if they succeed - as it should be.
Contrast this with something like Ethereum where the devs already got millions whether they succeed or fail. Their incentive is not to succeed, but to switch to a "new and improved" system where they take people's money all over again until people catch on. See: Ripple and Stellar.

Breaking support just means the price is likely to go lower in the near term. It's a technical consideration and has nothing to do with fundamentals. If the price reaches "ocean floor" like it did in 2011, a lot of people who felt they missed the boat will be ecstatic.

It's one thing to know about network effects, but quite another to experience them. They exert strong influence over the decisions of every single self-interested actor in the ecosystem. 
Ironically this is the same reason why Bitcoin will take time to gain traction. The difference is that Bitcoin is light years better than fiat money systems and gold, whereas I don't think I've even seen one altcoin with a clear-cut advantage over Bitcoin, let alone light years ahead. Monero and Boolberry apparently will have strong anonymity, but I never was very worried about anonymity not being solved in Bitcoin, and those coins involve some serious trade-offs anyway, even assuming their tech actually ends up proving itself.

XCP is an altcoin in the sense that it is another set of tokens that floats in value vs. BTC. 
XCP is not an altcoin in the sense that it didn't provide any funding to the devs/founders, and also in the sense that it would die without Bitcoin, so there's no possibility - at least in its present form - of it taking over Bitcoin or crowding it out. It seems it can only add value to Bitcoin, unlike altcoins which could theoretically overtake or replace Bitcoin. 
It's akin to sidechain that only goes one way (BTC to XCP via proof of burn) and for a limited time. Had sidechains been viable when Counterparty launched, the devs may have chosen a sidechain instead.

What just happened is a microcosm of the change Bitcoin enables in the world. Your comparative advantage in English usage might be small enough that you'd otherwise never be able to make any money from it, but with Bitcoin even a tiny advantage in any skill that anyone needs can result in monetary compensation. A quick and easy correction can now net you a relatively significant amount of money.

Ironically, it is state regulation (as well as lack of clarity in those regulations) that prevents new startups that would serve as competitors, actually giving users other places to take their business if their current exchange could not provide proof of reserves. As it stands, there are few established exchanges to choose from, so they can take their time implementing PoR since users cannot exert that much pressure as there's nowhere else to go. If regulations were relaxed or at least clarified a host of new exchanges would open and the natural competition in the market would enforce PoR in a voluntary manner, not by threat of force but by threat of customer migration.

A serious alt would share bitcoin's ledger (at launch) and just be an alt-protocol. The value proposition doesn't really work otherwise. It's telling of the envy-based get-rich-quick mindset that *none* of the alts have been alt-protocols, always alt-ledgers.

I don't think it's really a problem on Bitcoin-related subreddits. The problem is that it can take up a lot of space in threads on other subreddits, where it can easily be regarded as annoying or spammy. That would be counterproductive and could even get ChangeTip banned in some major subreddits.
In unrelated subreddits, substantial tips seem a lot more effective without being annoying, especially if there are already several tips in the thread.

What really matters is how difficult it is (i.e., how much mining power it takes) to overturn whatever number of confirmations you have reached. One confirmation in Bitcoin takes wayyyyyy more mining power to overturn than 4 confirmations in Litecoin, for example.

Ownership implies some legal or moral position, which has nothing to do with Bitcoin. 
In Bitcoin itself there is no concept of ownership, only control. If you are the only person who knows the private key to an address, you and you alone control the bitcoins in that address.
How that control relates to the legal/moral issue of ownership is up to courts and individuals to decide.

Doesn't work when the price moves against you. 
Volatility doesn't matter if you only spend bitcoins when they've risen in value so much that you have too many of them (rebalancing your portfolio by spending instead of selling). 
Most consumers aren't going to have a compelling reason to shop with Bitcoin at this stage - that is, to obtain bitcoins primarily for the purpose of shopping. Hopes pinned on merchant and consumer adoption for the next stage of growth are premature in my opinion. For now, Bitcoin is first and foremost an investment and deniable store of wealth. Though the investment is based in part on the future promise of Bitcoin as the world's currency, it's an error to confuse that future promise with its current utility.

That's like saying mathematicians don't believe in empirical evidence. Austrian economists simply don't define the term *economics* (actually praxeology, to be exact) to include empirical evidence.

Cryptocurrency is an unfortunate title. Bitcoin is really a candidate currency or if you like, a candidate cryptocurrency. The currency aspect of Bitcoin's promise is not that it is now a good currency, but that it would be a much better currency if everyone were to use it (note that it wouldn't be volatile then) versus if everyone were to use gold or the US dollar.
Bitcoin will be primarily an investment for several more years, and no investment goes up several orders of magnitude in a few years without extreme volatility.

I'd like to add that there are two completely different types of "deflation" being talked about when it comes to Bitcoin.
1) Rapid deflation of about 1000% per year until worldwide adoption is near complete.
2) After worldwide adoption, slight annual deflation merely caused by the economy growing and the money supply not growing.
The first should not be a concern if people realize that *as a currency* Bitcoin is still in the extreme early adopter phase; right now it's more of an [investment made attractive by its future prospects of becoming a currency]( Despite how it's often promoted (even in the sidebar of this subreddit), it's not a *currency* deflating at 1000% annually; it's an investment growing at 1000% annually. 
Upon worldwide adoption, it will be a currency that is mildly deflationary if the global economy grows and mildly inflationary if the global economy shrinks - just like gold. This is the only deflation that an economist should be considering insofar as they are assessing Bitcoin the Currency.

Why not? It's perfect for this application as it reflects exactly what trading reputation is trying to establish: goodwill and incentive not to cheat. Since every coin burned is effectively a donation to every other bitcoin holder (by permanently reducing the total money supply), it automatically helps everyone else in the community - in lieu of more traditional reputation-building that would involve helping the community in other ways. It also functions as an investment in Open Bazaar because the value of a trust rating on OB will grow over time if the platform takes off. Goodwill and incentive not to cheat.

The semantic ambiguity in terms like "Bitcoin" makes the attack seem like a threat, but it isn't really. The word *Bitcoin* refers to both a protocol for maintaining a ledger and a community of people with interest in that ledger, along with the infrastructure they control. If any oddities occured while there was an unusual mining situation going on, it's not like everyone's hands are tied and they have to let the protocol do its thing or else wait for an emergency hard fork; they can notice that an attack may be occuring and manually choose to exclude blocks from suspect sources (for example). It's not like we have to rely on the protocol to prevent 51% attacks. People are allowed to, and have every economic incentive to, use their heads as well.

The main thing in my view, for now at least, is that it removed a giant hurdle for casual investors...and casual investors may become large investors as well, after they dip their toes in. 
Many people have asked me how to buy bitcoins. Most just want the low-stress way, where they don't have to deal with getting verified and creating a secure private key and all that. Coinbase was *almost* good enough to recommend to friends and family, but I knew most of them would probably end up finding it too much of a hassle. With Circle it takes literally minutes and they've invested. That's a game-changer.

A free market can't be rigged. In a free market, manipulation is risky, and major manipulation is extremely risky. Put up a giant scare wall and it might work to let you scoop up some cheap coins...or another whale can call your bluff and buy your entire wall, benefitting tremendously from this golden opportunity to buy a huge amount with no slippage. Now you just sold low and will have to buy back high, losing a ton of money in the process. 
Moreover, as various tactics get tried, people get wise to them and it becomes a high stakes game of chicken. Whales watch like hawks for opportunities to buy in on the cheap, afforded to them by these manipulation attempts. 
Meanwhile holders can just sit back and watch the volatility unfold, knowing that if it really is just manipulation then it's all temporary anyway.

It raises an interesting question: is there some way for the user and the exchange to both have the private key for the user's bitcoins, so that the exchange could send them to other parties during trades but the user would have direct access to the coins up until that time?* Then the user would never have to wonder if the coins were there, worry about fractional reserve, or be subject to "withdrawal" restrictions. Then as long as the exchange was audited by a reputable firm the fiat side would also be taken care of. 
*User creates address and 2-of-3 SSS key, giving one to the exchange and keeping two. The user can then spend the coins at any time, while the exchange can only spend with the user's cooperation, as in, during a trade. Trading might be slower, though. Someone please correct me if the technical details don't work.
Edit: For example, to place a limit order, you'd send a second SSS key to the exchange so that they could move the coins when needed. That way they could only steal or lose whatever was actually on the orderbook. 
Another possibility would be for what Barry Silbert was talking about for his exchange: make it some kind of twice-daily auction. Less liquidity but since there'd be time to send coins for the auction there'd be less security risk from having coins "on" the exchange.

OpenBazaar is much more than a decentralized eBay, which itself would be quite a thing because of the fee savings (not only cheaper but also more all-encompassing because it lowers the cost of entry).
The flexibility and potential frictionlessness offered by this app ecosystem with its reputation system and things that could be built on top of it could revolutionize what we know as commerce by expanding its scope to areas most people have never considered. This includes [prediction/insurance markets]( decentralized AirBnB and Uber, decentralized Reddit/Yelp/etc., and even things like paying a tiny fee for someone to move out of your way on the highway. 
The currently foreseeable endpoint of the evolution set in motion by Bitcoin, now accelerated by OpenBazaar and Storj, is the full utilization of all resources available to civilization, and more generally every possible win-win trade that people can make being made.
When you combine OpenBazaar with other new technologies, like quadcopter delivery, it becomes even more amazing to imagine. Consider what percentage of each day the average person uses their screwdriver. If it's an average of 1 minute per day (1/1440 of the day), that means there are something like over 1000 times as many screwdrivers in the world as there need to be. It also means that the cost of having a screwdriver whenever you need it is potentially 1000 times less than what it is now. Expand this to all goods transportable by quadcopter. What is missing is the transport system and the commerce/reputation platform to enable it to run smoothly in terms of both trustless payments and disputes about, for example, damaged or soiled screwdrivers.

Yes, regulations ruin most of the point of Bitcoin. Moreover, regulations are likely to be ineffective, because they will just push the action to other countries that don't implement the regulations, as well as to the black market in the countries that do regulate it. 
I would argue thusly: Bitcoin is either going to flop and be useless, or it's going to take over the world and be used for everything, because once it gains enough momentum in terms of people using and accepting it, its advantages over any existing money system are vast and unassailable. Regulation in the scenario where Bitcoin fails doesn't matter to anyone. What people should care about, then, is what happens in the scenario where the entire world adopts Bitcoin and some countries try to regulate it. Regulating it will of course limit its usefulness, probably severely, within the regulating countries and will drive new businesses - and any existing businesses who experience great benefits from using it - to other countries. Basically the countries that regulate Bitcoin, especially if they regulate it heavily, will be signing their own economic death warrant. If the US regulates, China can take the entire industry away by not regulating it, for example.

Hmm, you're actually right in spirit about the past being 100%, as a criticism of the OP, because it isn't fair to compare 2011 (a situation where we know the outcome, but people back then didn't) to now (a situation where we simply don't know the outcome). 
I happen to think the present low is very much like the 2011 low, in that I expect major price growth over the coming year or two, but the mere fact that people thought the price would go lower and it ended up going way higher doesn't mean that every time people think it will go lower it will automatically go much higher. There are reasons to expect the price to rise, but this isn't really one of them, at least not by itself.

This is exactly the point of Peter R's [spin-off]( idea. If it's the ledger that encodes all the value, and the protocol is just about having a more useful and efficient way of maintaining that (*same*) ledger, then every "altcoin" launch so far has been fundamentally misguided. The way to do it would be to piggyback on THE ledger (the Bitcoin ledger) by having initial coin distribution to every bitcoin holder automatically by making the private key to every bitcoin address that has a nonzero balance able to also sign transactions from a corresponding address in that altcoin/altledger scheme containing the exact same proportion of the total ledger value (private key to an address that holds 1% of all BTC would also be the private key to an address that holds 1% of the altcoin). Then it'd be the same ledger, just different protocol, fairness would be a non-issue, and there'd be no motive to pump and dump. Holding the coin would be opt-out instead of opt-in, and the devs could buy from the inevitable initial sellers if they wanted a greater stake in their work. That way it'd be, "let the best protocol win!" (and everyone in the space wins with no need to be distracted by keeping up with every new altcoin), not the silly "let the best ledger win!" (cuz if it's that, we already know the winner).

I agree, and it is the investment upside that creates the incentive. The upside will eventually fade away, along with the volatility, as it reaches mainstream adoption and the benefits switch to those enabled by a bitcoin-powered world. For example, instead of very competitively priced remittances, you'd have nearly free remittances with no middlemen or hassle. Many new things are enabled when everyone uses Bitcoin rather than having to seek out people who might accept it.
Bitcoin is designed for the investment to be the killer app at first, giving way eventually to all the other things that the network effect of a widely disseminated currency allows for.

The question then is, "What is money, and is it different than pretend money?" Money is also just a ledger, in the end. It's just maintained through an extremely primitive sneakernet system where actual resources like gold are moved around, or where government-trust-backed paper notes are traded. 
Flip the script: the ledger is what's fundamental, not the currency units. Bitcoins aren't pretend money, they aren't real money either; rather Money (the system) is a primitive version of Bitcoin. Bitcoin and Money are both ledger systems, but Bitcoin is far better. See for example:

As someone who most would call a staunch libertarian, I agree. This neatly encapsulates why there should be no ideology called "libertarianism," at least insofar as it means anti-statism. What actually happens is the environment and tools change and enable or disable centralized power structures to persist in human society. 
Bitcoin dissolves centralized power structures, moving libertarians/voluntarists toward their ideals of justice by decentralizing the legal system, socialists toward their ideals of eliminating poverty by decentralizing economic control, neocons toward their ideals of a world safe from military threats by decentralizing force, environmentalists toward their ideals of reducing our footprint on the natural world by avoiding tragedies of the commons, etc. Every political stripe wants the world to be a better place, with more people being happier, healthier, safer, prosperous, and all around fulfilled.

The problem isn't pools or even large pools. The problem is vesting pools with temporary default control over where hashing power is directed. 
The solution is not to reduce freedom of association, but to *increase* it. Either a protocol level change that would enable risk pooling without giving pool operators control over hashing power, or just some innovative financial product (mining insurance) that can already work with the protocol as is. Alternatively, a form of risk pooling that gives no one entity any kind of control over the hashing power.

As an average Joe, I assume you're not interested in ideology, early adoption of a cool new technology, or offshoring your wealth, so very few of the responses here likely present benefits for you, except those that mentioned the investment potential. Other exceptions would be if you live in or deal with a country where it is otherwise difficult/expensive to send money. 
You will be interested in it within a year or two for those other reasons as it becomes more useful and user-friendly, but probably not now.
However, the investment potential is still incredibly huge, and as an average Joe you likely want to make money. Investing is about recognizing trends before others do, and if you spend the time and energy to figure out a highly unconventional technology like Bitcoin you have a chance at making a lot of money just because others are put off by how difficult it is to analyze from an investment perspective. Do some research with the links provided and within a few weeks you may have an answer to whether this is an investment opportunity for you. As a bonus, you'll be better versed in the world of blockchain technology and distributed systems so that you can take advantage of future investments and also be ready to use the technology before other people can yet take advantage of it.

**Serious misunderstanding of exponential growth in this thread**
People were incredulous when the price jumped every time in the past, saying, "The inflation is now 10 times as large, keeping the price down." No, the overall market and number of investors grow tenfold, causing the price to jump tenfold, which incentivizes greater infrastructure buildout and maturation of the ecosystem, resulting in a faster inflow of new capital *over time* to bring on the next price jump.
In the interim this theory is always posited, and always wrong. It is merely another way of saying, "I doubt the price will continue to grow exponentially." There is nothing new added by talking about inflation.

That still doesn't mean there's anything magic about that exact hedging rate. Some statistical analysis attempts on Bitcointalk have put the average dishoarding rate for long-term hodlers at 10-20% per price doubling, so that might be more like a magic number/range.

The assertions were intended to be self-evident, but OK obviously you disagree, so I'll elaborate. (Not [pejorative]( phrasing, perhaps "dramatic" is the word. I simply tried to match your dramatic tone with equal tenor.)


In the current era, Bitcoin is far more an investment than a currency and it is rising much faster than the inflation rate (and has been for years), whereas in the future when it has become a currency the inflation rate is too low to incentivize the miners. In neither case are savers punished, and in fact they have been handsomely rewarded so far. 
If there were a way to keep inflation high even after the investment phase ended, it would kill the investment proposition right now. Why? Because present investors only wish to take on the immense risk of Bitcoin at this time because of the prospects of great rewards, which are only possible if inflation stays low enough, and are underpinned in the minds of so many by the so-far unshakable 21 million coin limit. Changing the limit sets a precedent, and no one knows then when it might be changed again for another reason. Now you may disagree with how many people this matters to and how much, but at that point we're simply estimating other people's general opinions and it's not such an interesting discussion.

Re: Proof of resources to mine an altcoin usable for mesh networks (around 20 minutes in)
While proof of resources is a fascinating idea and mesh networks and storj are extremely exciting, I feel like Andreas hasn't fully internalized the idea that Bitcoin is a ledger. We don't need a whole bunch of ledgers - there's just no point. Why not instead have a set of automatic contracts in the blockchain that receive bitcoins into a pool for resources used and send bitcoins from that pool for resources provided? (And that's assuming the obvious isn't done: simply pay providers directly in bitcoins, perhaps with escrow and insurance provided by Counterparty or similar.)

It brings knowledge about the future into the price system, with all that that entails.
With a big enough prediction market you can get remarkably accurate weather forecasts, crowdsource knowledge in a far more reliable way, or take out an insurance policy with no middlemen and in any amount (a subsistence farmer in Africa could take out a very small crop insurance policy so that his family won't starve during a drought).
And then there are all the scientific applications: when you put a price on knowledge and force pundits to put their money where their mouth is, including anonymously, the results cut through politics and weed out the loud but uninformed (even if someone delusional bets big, they will soon go bankrupt and cease to influence the market; meanwhile the most consistently accurate predictors will grow rich and their bets will move the market more and more toward perfect accuracy).

This selling pressure, if it ever exists, is very short term. Almost every spender is also an investor, and as an investor they prefer to hold a certain percentage of their assets in Bitcoin. If spending brings that percentage uncomfortably low for them then they will buy back. Not to mention that the people most likely to spend in the first place are those who feel their portfolio is currently overweight in Bitcoin, which means they are spending instead of selling, which they would have presumably done anyway.

Assuming you have the oracles (trusted price feeds), which are necessary to enable pegged assets like bitUSD, the same can be done with Bitcoin via Counterparty. You just set up a contract for difference based on the BTC price and have the oracle provide the price data.
Fittingly enough, OpenBazaar may finally enable trusted feeds to be a profitable line of business to get into. The trusted feeds would simply provide their feed data for a small price, as merchants on OpenBazaar. Eventually it'd be a side business for sites like weather.com and for the exchanges.

New people that *buy bitcoins for the purpose of making purchases* are innovators, hobbyists, or ideologues. They do it for fun, basically.

Not exactly. Many prominent Austrian economists were/are pretty late to the party, mainly due to the distraction of the regression theorem and gold traditions, whereas the head of the Minneapolis Fed predicted way back in 1997 that a system like Bitcoin would eventually be enabled by developing technology and that it could ultimately jeopardize the central bank control of monetary policy.

It's hilarious: suppose there really were these rich people who were greedily hoarding most of the world's money. If they were to *stop* hoarding it and actually spend all of it on goods and services, they'd monopolize most of the world's resources (steel, oil, etc.) and the time of most of the world's service people, leaving everyone else vastly poorer, materially, than they are now. Everyone else would have to compete for less than half the goods and services that were available before. The net result is that prices double, and thereby standards of living halve, for the 99%.
Hoarding is just foregoing consumption. The 99% should hope that the 1% *never* spend their money, as that would be the exact same as them donating their money to everyone else in proportion to how much money everyone else has.
Note how failing to understand this results in failing to understand deflation, proof of burn, and every other concept related to quantity of money versus quantity of actual resources in society.

It doesn't reshuffle ownership stake for anyone who doesn't participate in the trading. 
Peter R's spinoff proposal is functionally not an altcoin (not an alt-ledger) but rather an alt-protocol, retaining the original Bitcoin ledger distribution by default for anyone who chooses to take no action. A spinoff is such that when bitcoin holders start trading, their choice is to opt-out (by selling off their free alt-protocol coins if they don't want them) or stay put and retain their same percentage of the market cap by default if the new protocol takes over. Rather than the situation heretofore wherein people have had to opt-in by buying up a similarly sized stake in every altcoin if they wanted to guard against a possible takeover of Bitcoin. 
Peter R's proposal recognizes the ledger (along with the issuance schedule) as primary, rather than the protocol used to update that ledger. Holders that don't want to be bothered with speculation on which protocol will win can retain their stake in the ledger no matter what. The Winkelvii's 1% of the money supply sitting in cold storage remains 1% of the money supply no matter which alt-protocol wins. It's very comforting for investors and long-term hodlers. While many people may switch to, say, Lite-protocol, and then suddenly switch back when that protocol fails spectacularly, that cold storage stake remains safe all the while. Only those who choose to specifically speculate on which *protocol* will win are subject to any possibility of loss. 
Speculation then takes places where it should, on competing protocols rather than on competing ledgers. One ledger to rule them all, smooth and reversible transitions between protocols all using the same ledger (after trading starts, it's not the same ledger but it remains the same for anyone who chooses not to speculate; the point is there is no danger of losing your stake, 1% remains 1% by default, or we can say "the ledger remains the same for each holder jf they want it to").

Investment vs. speculation (by which I assume you mean short-term trading) is entirely a personal choice and isn't inherent in the asset itself. One can invest Buffet-style in Bitcoin based on its long-term promise (current unrecognized value) or one can trade the volatility. 
Perhaps you are trying to say that Bitcoin is higher risk than, say, Coca-Cola. But again risk is not inherent in an asset but in a position. 10% of your portfolio in a low-risk investment vs. 1% in a high-risk asset is not necessarily any safer.
Bottom line: Buffet isn't avoiding Bitcoin because it's too risky or ephemeral, but because he doesn't understand it.

Stop thinking of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency, start thinking of it as a ledger plus a ledger-updating-protocol. The protocol may change in its non-monetary aspects, but as long as the ledger is maintained that is of no consequence for bitcoin holders.

That's what you get for marketing Bitcoin as a currency (I'm looking at you, sidebar). 
It's simply not compelling as a currency and payment system yet. It's compelling as an investment based on that future promise, as teleportable and hide-able gold, and sometimes for remittances and getting around financial oppression. 
Merchant adoption is primarily helpful for public image, not because consumers are going to suddenly decide that some marginal improvements over credit cards are worth them learning how to deal with Bitcoin. Even if Amazon came on board tomorrow, unless they started offering discounts, it wouldn't make the "currency of the Internet" marketing any less premature.

Even assuming fractional reserve is somehow allowed to fly (it won't be, because there will be no government to erect the barriers to entry that currently enable fractional reserve, plus blockchain transparency is very easy compared to vault transparency), it would result in at most 10x inflation.

Yes, more *rhetorically* defensible. But where are we if we can't even acknowledge the truth in the very core forums where Bitcoin is discussed? This is not a free ride; there are consequences for distorting the view here. For example, people will come to Bitcoin looking for utility for their everyday lives because it's marketed as simply "Internet money," and they find that functionality isn't actually very useful, then they decide Bitcoin is a fad. The true picture is subtler, that Bitcoin is something that will be useful in the future but that it requires investment in the present in order to get there. 
Oversimplification in the name of trying to deflect criticism is a losing battle: in trying to avoid criticism associated with "dirty investment" we end up drawing the more fatal criticism that Bitcoin is useless as a currency. Marketing Bitcoin as something it isn't yet causes some of the blowback we see everyday here.

1) Oracles. These would often be centralized, but not necessarily. The blockchain is a decentralized oracle. You could have, for example, a smart contract hinging on some aspect of Bitcoin that is recorded in the blockchain. A centralized oracle might be weather.com for a bet (or insurance) regarding weather conditions. 
2) It depends on if the legal dispute hinges on public info. If not, other databases - preferably through some decentralized platform - would have to be developed. It's chicken and egg, but oce there is a betting platform (Counterparty, etc.) the financial incentive to build platforms will be vastly greater.
3) Crypto, unless I misunderstood your question.

Spot on comment, and it's also worth noting how societal norms seem to invisibly change as regulations tighten, eventually making the regulations irreversible. For example, when there were fewer regulations on the stock market I seriously doubt it was seen as the province of the everyman to go around investing in stocks (bubbles/manias notwithstanding) without the ability to do thorough research. Once it becomes "safe," more and more people start to do it, until it becomes a necessity, and the regulations start to be regarded as obvious and indispensable.

There are a lot of good reasons you *might* want to use Bitcoin for payments now, but as a very much not-yet-mainstream technology for payments there's no reason to feel bad if you simply want to hold it as an investment at this time. It just means you're an early investor but not an early adopter as far as the payment technology. Practically this means you'll start using it when merchants make it obviously worth your while.
EDIT: Note that even as a pure investor, as your investment appreciates and you need to [divest some for prudence]( buying stuff with Bitcoin will often be more efficient, safer, and cheaper than selling on an exchange and wiring the money back to your bank. This will apply whenever you both (a) have too many bitcoins in your portfolio (thanks to price growth) and (b) have some significant purchases you want to make that can be done in Bitcoin (e.g., new computer from Dell or NewEgg).

Parent is talking about anyone hoarding, not companies in particular. 
The main problem in this thread is people are treating saving as categorically different from other types of investment. Hoarding money is just the most general type of investment one can make in an economy. It covers everything, not tech startups or any other sector specifically.
If your concern is tech startups, it should be noted that the reason for deflation in a hard currency environment (gold, Bitcoin) is simply the economy becoming more productive on average. If it's becoming 10% more productive each year on average, then finding a tech investment that returns higher than 10% shouldn't be very challenging. And the same argument applies at greater levels of deflation.

Bitcoin is all you need in order to pay for stuff, including storage. But the trend in 2014 has been to issue an altcoin, preferably in a sneaky way that makes it "needed" for the system to work, in order "fund development." This trend seems to be changing recently, just because all the premine-funded products have sucked while some of the fairest launches have produced rapid development. I've been most impressed by completely unfunded projects like Open Transactions, Counterparty, and perhaps Colored Coins.

If that turns out to be the case the protocol can be tweaked slightly to mess with Counterparty and CC.

Not while so many people are still buying mining equipment as a way of obtaining bitcoins. As long as there are mining rigs on the market that cost $XXXX for someone to buy and run, if that person wants to spend $XXXX to buy bitcoins but can obtain more bitcoins by buying that mining equipment, they will do so. This should be fairly simple to check. 
EDIT: And note that even if it were the case that soon all mined bitcoins are sold, this has no effect on the price. If 60% were sold before and later it becomes 100% this should have zero effect, since now those 40% of bitcoins that were mined by people who were holding - i.e., using mining rigs as a cheaper way to invest in bitcoins - will be unavailable to those investors and they will then be forced to start buying on the open market, pushing the price up to the exact same degree as the big miners push it down. (1440  BTC will be sold that weren't being sold before, and 1440 BTC will be bought that weren't being bought before.)

The problem is that if Ethereum does all its proponents claim, it could eventually overtake Bitcoin as an all-around superior system. Since there's only a need for one major financial ledger for civilization, it essentially boils down to launching a premined altcoin with absolutely massive built-in stake for the founders. Not massive compared to balder schemes like Ripple, but still ludicrously massive: several percent claim on the entire world's wealth if successful. This doesn't inspire people's confidence and trust. A simple IPO in BTC-denominated stock might be an appropriate way to fund it.

Portfolio risk isn't just the riskiness of the asset, but also the percentage of your portfolio that asset takes up.

Well it's yet another case of government intervention apparently being "needed" (in an immediate sense) to solve a problem brought about by government intervention. If it weren't for the monopoly telecom system created by government intervention, net neutrality would be pointless. Provided that system remains in place, net neutrality may or may not have some mitigating effects (though more likely not, simply because it's another zig or zag on the way to Soviet-style central planning). 
In principle, though, it's possible for additional regulation to help lessen the bad effects of existing regulations. Rarely, but possible: if only one company is allowed to make food and it charges $50 for a loaf of bread just because, so-called price controls are going to help. But of course the real price control was the law that said no other companies are allowed to make food. Similarly if the monopoly telecom system we have now results in harmful practices, and if abolishing the monopoly system is considered off the table, then net neutrality could theoretically help.
However this all assumes that the ideal of every packet costing the same amount to send and getting the same prioritization is even desirable. I doubt that's even the case. At least in theory, a free market system with every packet costing a tiny bit should introduce some incentive to economize (rather than stream a 1080p music video that you're only listening to, or torrenting an entire discography that you'll probably never listen to, just because you can), resulting in faster and cheaper internet for everyone for the things that they actually care about.

Because it's a fallacy. 
You have to start by asking why people hold bitcoins at all. It's not like people are just saving them up in order to enable new purchases. Or even if anyone does this, they are contributing to buying pressure just as much since they need to buy bitcoins coins for their purchases, meaning their contribution is neutral. 
Everyone else holds bitcoins as an investment. Here again a key question arises: why do they hold the amount they do? Is it arbitrary? Of course not. People buy as many as fits their confidence in the investment. For some people that's no more than 10% of their portfolio, while for others it could be 80%. Whatever it is, there is a reason why it's not higher or lower. There is a certain percentage people target, whether consciously or just unconsciously as they feel too scared or too greedy and want to change the percentage allocated to bitcoins.
As the price rises and falls, though, this percentage changes. Within a small margin the holder may not care enough to buy/sell to get the percentage back where they want it, but eventually they will. Eventually fear of loss or greed for bigger gains will motivate them to make the necessary adjustment.
Merchant adoption simply gives *those who would be sellers anyway* another more efficient way to dishoard their bitcoins. If they happen to need a new computer and they also happen to feel overweight in Bitcoin, they now can skip some time, risk, and hassle by buying through Dell or Newegg instead of selling on an exchange, having the money wired back to them, etc. 
Some people who don't feel overweight in Bitcoin may still spend them, but again only within that margin where they don't yet feel the lack of coins in their portfolio and buy back. 
So merchant adoption can shake loose a few coins at the margins temporarily, but it is a small effect and is later compensated for as all the people who spent anyway will want to re-buy sooner than they otherwise would have, even if not immediately. Medium and long term, the effect is a wash.
Except that merchant adoption does help public image and make Bitcoin more useful, buttressing the investment proposition, which means it's in fact a net positive - as common sense would dictate.

If they are to become investors, they'll need something more solid. In that case I'd explain that it's a ledger system, just like every money really is. They have to understand why it's global, instant, hide-able, and can't be tampered with by anyone. Not only must they know but also be thoroughly convinced, against the fear of losing money. For that, they have to understand at least something about cryptography, economics, and distributed open source platforms.

People love to talk about capitalism and communism without ever defining the terms in any consistent way. 
Here's a radical idea: both capitalism (completely free markets in society) and communism (essentially resource sharing within a tribe with authority vested in tribal elders) are correct, it just depends on the scale you're looking at. Even the most radical libertarian capitalist won't deny that a parent-child relationship should not enable the child to have complete freedom nor should it force children to pay for food from the adult if the adult does not feel like feeding their kids. 
So communism at the family level is accepted by most everyone. But as society grows larger than families, extended families, and tribes, people start to differ in their opinions on which system of value should apply. Total communists believe that the family or tribal values of sharing and elder authority should apply regardless of "tribe size," whereas capitalists believe that at a certain scale we need to respect a different set of values, namely free market values. (There is no such thing as a total capitalist, unless there is someone who believes a child and parent interaction should be entirely capitalist from birth.)
I think the total communists/socialists are wrong because they don't see how large/gigantic tribes have different dynamics and that it's impossible to extend that familial ethic to arbitrarily large groups. Capitalists also err in their rhetoric, though, because they fail to see where communist ideals come from: these tribal instincts that work so well for families and maybe even extended families, and "feel so right." 
These overlarge tribes (millions of people) are what F.A. Hayek calls an extended order or extended society - i.e., a society extended beyond the instinctual family size we are mentally adapted to deal with. See:

Apparently can't be done due to data size restrictions. 
But what probably *can* be done is to make a storjcoin [spin-off]( That is, the private keys to every bitcoin address will also be able to access a proportionate percentage of the total supply of storjcoins. Effectively, every bitcoin holder would be an investor in Storjcoin by default, to the exact same extent they are an investor in Bitcoin. There'd be no premine issues then, because Storjcoin would just be an alt-protocol, not an alt-ledger like all the other altcoins so far.
If Storj doesn't do this, someone will probably fork it. It's hard to imagine how the spin-off wouldn't become the dominant fork.

Well in the possible far future scenario where spending fees don't give miners sufficient incentive, I suppose there is only one other possible source: saving fees. It just comes down to how it's implemented. 
But I can't shake the feeling that there should be a clean argument somewhere based on economic necessity that transaction fees either will or won't be enough to fund miners. I will have to think more about it.
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:43:49
The core problem with such an argument is that every currency user is by default also an investor. 
Even if you're living paycheck to paycheck, you're still not going to want to be paid in money that punishes you for the small amount of time you do hold it (the small losses matter more when you're broke). Not to mention that demurrage wouldn't be incentivizing any additional spending in that case. 
And people who aren't flat broke are punished in proportion to how much they're able to get beyond living paycheck to paycheck. Everyone is punished for choosing that currency (except of course those people who figure out how to game the system by sending their coins around periodically to other addresses they own).

Prediction markets might be another way to ensure content creators make money. 
Prediction markets reward those who have information before others do, and content creators are in exactly that position. If you're an indy filmmaker and you believe you have an amazing film that will be very popular, create a bet on how popular it will be* and buy a $100 stake (an oracle will be required to assess popularity metrics). Many people will be willing to bet against you because usually this is easy money since many filmmakers probably have delusions of making it big. But maybe you really do have a blockbuster on your hands and you'll make bank.

How? Anyone who is spending their bitcoins is also an investor, and as an investor they're trying to maintain a certain ratio of Bitcoin to other assets in their portfolio. If spending puts them below that ratio, they're going to want to buy back the coins ASAP. And more pointedly, as the price rises people's portfolios become Bitcoin-heavy and they have to sell some...except that now they can spend some of that instead of selling it all. 
The net effect is completely neutral on the price in the short term, and bullish in the medium and long term.

The way Bitcoin seems to work during the adoption phase is that, as the price increases, holders tend to hodl until Bitcoin grows to 60-80% of their total assets, then sell an average of 17% for each time the price doublea (according to Risto Pietila's [analysis]( which ends up keeping their BTC holdings in the 60-80% range.
Now some of this 17%-per-doubling divestment can be funneled into Tiger, Overstock, and porn instead of going through the trouble to convert to fiat partially just to buy what people wanted from these sites. Basically merchant adoption represents a new way to dishoard; while only true innovators will buy bitcoins for the sole purpose of making a purchase, a casual investor doing simple buy-and-hold can now make a significant number of purchases as merely conventional early adopters, or even what cam be considered a mainstream type of action in the sense that they are simply taking advantage of the efficiency their situation affords them (portfolio is getting too bitcoin-heavy + really want that 4K TV) rather than buying to support Bitcoin or because of novelty.

Also consider venture capital, startups, and even people taking time off or reducing the hours of their day jobs to work on Bitcoin projects. 
All these are things people do *in lieu of* investing in Bitcoin directly. 
* If you're a venture capitalist and you have $30 million to invest in Bitcoin, you will allocate more to direct bitcoin buying if you believe bitcoins are underpriced, and you will allocate more toward investing in Bitcoin-related startups if you believe bitcoins are overpriced. Either way, you're simply thinking about how many bitcoins you can end up with and realizing that investing in the startup has a better chance of leaving you with more bitcoins, ultimately. 
* If you're an everyday person with $20,000 to invest and you happen to know how to run a mining rig, you will allocate more to direct bitcoin buying if you think price is low vs. mining profitability, and you will allocate more toward a mining rig if you believe the opposite. Either way, you're simply thinking about how many bitcoins you can end up with and realizing that investing in the mining rig has a better chance of leaving you with more bitcoins, ultimately. 
* If you have $20,000 to invest but you decide to quit your day job and work on a Bitcoin-related project, you'll likely not buy a whole $20,000 worth of bitcoins and instead use a lot of the money to support yourself while you are jobless. 
None of these actions push the price up directly, but they all add value to the ecosystem. Moreover, as each of these areas get saturated - there are too many startups, mining becomes unprofitable, and there are few low-hanging fruit projects to work on - all these money flows will again be funneled into direct bitcoin buying, resulting in spectacular price action.

It's useful to note that "inflationary" in the Bitcoin sense means something quite different from inflationary in the Fed policy sense. In particular, Fed inflation is unknown and therefore always somewhat surprising (not very surprising to some, but...). Bitcoin inflation is never unknown, so it is *never* surprising. It's baked in. No investor isn't privy to this knowledge. 
In the way the word is usually used~~s~~, inflationary means *surprisingly* inflationary. In that usual sense, then, Bitcoin is not inflationary at all. It is completely predictable.

I definitely appreciate the light-handed modding approach. There are a lot of unseen ill effects to censorship and really any mod manipulation of the natural order, and these have to be weighed against the (much more easily identifiable) benefit. Of course blatant spam and such is an exception, but my opinion - based on many years of experience with a variety of forums - is that something should have a pretty high bar to qualify for mod intervention. 
ETA: A lot of problems are self-rectifying, and/or have hidden benefits: like the annoying to-the-moon/spartans-hold memes served as a great indicator to savvy investors that the market was overheated. Modding them too much would wreck the less obvious function this subreddit provides as a tap into the pulse of the market. Perhaps even double posts serve a kind of purpose, saying that this post deserves more front page real estate, etc. Who knows? It's kind of like those stories of preventing wildfires or killing off wolves that were preying on farmers' sheep.

That's probably just volatility, for all anyone knows. It's been less than a year since the price was doubling in a week sometimes. A 20% drop in a week isn't particularly unusual for Bitcoin, historically. What makes it seem unusual is the recent stability, which itself is pretty atypical.

The most interesting thing about the deflationary spiral argument is that it doesn't even work on its own terms except in certain bounds. For example, 10,000% deflation results in massive...spending! If you had $10K net worth and next year had $1M, would you really *not* go on a big shopping spree?
EDIT: Deflation as a natural market phenomenon (which has nothing to do with Bitcoin at this time, since Bitcoin isn't yet a currency in the proper sense of having, well, currency) is simply the market telling you that the economy is growing so you're getting richer. If you'd like to spend more with your extra wealth, go ahead, or you can *hope it continues* and be frugal and save up for possible greater wealth later. But eventually, if deflation continues, you'll be so rich it'll be almost silly not to spend some.

Although it goes without saying, most people didn't buy their bitcoins in order to do transactions or go shopping. Security needs to be correlated with the benefit an attacker would gain by messing with the network - i.e., correlated with market cap. Transactions are merely a side note. The value of Bitcoin, at present, primarily derives from its future promise, not its present transactional utility. That's what investing is all about. 
At some point it does become overkill, but that is self-correcting as mining profitability falls.

To do a proper analysis of sentiment requires looking at the people who bought in during the last bubble (unless we get down in the double digits (very unlikely), in which case it's the last two bubbles).

This part tells me there's a fundamental misunderstanding. 
In terms of the ledger, "1 BTC" is just an accounting term for a certain percentage of the total ledger. Doubling the money supply while doubling everyone's holdings simultaneously changes nothing in terms of the ledger, whether we're talking about bitcoins, fiat money, or gold. 1% of the ledger remains 1% of the ledger. No loss of purchasing power, no functional difference, just different numbers in the accounting. 
A thousand spinoffs could be launched and your 1% stake in *the* ledger is still a 1% stake, whether Lite-protocol wins or Bit-protocol stays, or even if they coexist. Other people might sell their bitcoins or their litecoins for the other, but it changes nothing for you because you retain 1% stake in both, meaning 1% of both market caps as well as 1% of the combined market cap. Only those who wish to speculate on the protocols stand to gain or lose. As a simple hodler you can relax no matter the outcome of the protocol battle. 
As an investor you have lost nothing even if you take no action, and there is no one working to undermine your investment. Your slice of the total ecosystem is never changed. 


"Bitcoin" the ledger or the protocol? Such people would not be opposed to Bitcoin the ledger (+issuance schedule), but opposed to Bitcoin the protocol for updating that ledger. From an economic standpoint, the *ledger* is primary, and "may the best protocol win."

has a point. If people are sold on Bitcoin, they will buy it. Even if mining will give them a few bucks, it's immaterial to adoption as they'll just sell it off if they don't understand the actual benefits and potential Bitcoin offers. And at this point the average person in the USA, for example, has little reason to use Bitcoin other than as an investment (and that's only if they can understand why it's a good investment).
Price declines seem to put people in this existential malaise where everything looks like a problem. If the long term exponential growth trend is ever seriously broken maybe such discussion will be warranted, but to fret about "not enough new adopters," after a year where Bitcoin outperformed every investment on the planet, is just silly.

True. I more meant it could be what brings on the next wave of exponential growth. Each new tenfold expansion needs some kind of game-changer.

Though the things that are created during this stage where everyone can buy easily may be enough to, in turn, bring on the mainstream adoption in a couple of years.

People looking at only the price believe they are looking at market sentiment as a whole, but this isn't really true: the total money flow into the Bitcoin space is what to look at, and those spigots turn alternately to mining investment, startup investment, project investment, and actual direct bitcoin buying. 
As one sector of the Bitcoin space becomes oversaturated (price bubble, mining bubble, VC bubble, too many people trying to create similar 2.0 projects, etc.), capital sloshes into other sectors. How are we doing on each right now?
* Price: the bubble seems pretty well popped
* Mining: Definitely in a bubble, difficult versus price is at unprecedented levels
* Venture capital: Looking frothy to me, with 2014 being by far the biggest year despite the bitcoin price being down all year (I'm not qualified to comment on whether blockchain.info deserves its huge round, for example, but it does raise eyebrows)
* Projects: So-called Bitcoin 2.0 has been one of the hottest spaces this year, with plenty of big IPOs with little or no working product to show for it (and ironically the projects with no IPO being the most successful, especially Counterparty). Also plenty of redundancy with every platform trying to do decentralized exchanges, prediction markets, pegs, and other types of things based on smart contracts. It's great that there's competition, but how much of is rational/realistic? Money is being thrown at just about everything. But note that even projects like wallet apps and websites by volunteers often entail people quitting their day jobs, meaning they either need to need to sell some of their bitcoins to get by or they invest less of their saved up fiat money into bitcoins directly because they need the money for daily expenses. Either way this is more diverting of capital away from would-be BTC buying. Certainly more projects is better, but the number of wallets, for example, is hard to call sparse. 
From a bird's-eye view the ecosystem looks to be continuing its exponential growth, with capital just being diverted into different channels at different times, only one of which is price growth.

That's why Bitcoin isn't ready for mainstream adoption, let alone smart contracts. Who said it was? That's the whole investment proposition. If it were already mainstream or if its value proposition were already clear to the average person, there'd be no getting in on the ground floor.

It's certainly helpful to spend it (and buy back) if you are so inclined, but that isn't convenient for most people so it's unlikely to happen on a widespread basis until there are more attractive shopping options. This isn't really lamentable, it's just the stage Bitcoin is at. If it were already really convenient and useful for shopping the price would be a lot a higher and much of investment upside would already be gone.


Holding is using :) Most of the value comes from, and will come from, people holding it as an investment and later as a stable store of value, even if Bitcoin eventually powers the entirety of global commerce.

Many people don't want to admit that Bitcoin is still very much an investment, very little a currency. I'm not sure why that's hard to admit. It certainly couldn't be expected to be a currency so quickly, or to go up exponentially in a smooth curve without volatility. Investment is what bootstraps it to each "next step" on the path to mainstream adoption, each step opening new avenues, each order of magnitude growth changing the overall picture dramatically. 
I don't recommend people learn how to use Bitcoin for shopping or even remittances, although if I knew people in certain businesses I might mention remittances. I recommend people look into it for long-term investment purposes only. That's where the interest is, and should be, for most people right now. A couple more orders of magnitude and the other features will come to the fore. Meanwhile hobbyists and other very early adopters can play around with the shopping and remittance features, and as an investor it sometimes makes sense to utilize these options to divest or to take advantage of situations where someone you need to pay also happens to accept Bitcoin.

It's starting to look like the very idea of modern stock-market-like exchange with instantaneous trades is too early for the security best practices in the ecosystem at their current stage of development. After all, the only reason you really ever need a third party to have access to your coins is in order to make instantaneous trades. If you could set a rate then send directly to the buyer and wait for confirmation, with the exchange only handling the fiat end, the trades would be a lot slower but it would get the job done, without any chance of these large thefts/losses.

It doesn't really happen voluntarily, in the "voluntaryist" sense, in most cases: to have a tragedy of the commons, you have to first have a commons. A commons here means a resource that no one can homestead or make private ownership or right-of-usage claims on. The usual reason for that inability to make claims is that a government restricts such claims. 
A person can't go claim a homestead in a national park, for example, so - absent pollution laws - if they live next to the park they might dump pollutants into it. There's no owner to sue them or take revenge, and they themselves can't own it, hunt on it, etc. 
However, if people were allowed to homestead the land, like the frontier of old, people would move in and set up property rights in some areas, and perhaps in others they would merely assign hunting/fishing rights. This avoids the tragedy of the commons, because people don't want to, say, pollute the land because someone will sue them or because they themselves own the land and want to enjoy it or at least maintain its property value, especially in a place where unspoiled beauty and biodiversity are key to the value.

In most ways it's not a very good system yet, but I think most Bitcoin supporters do realize that. Similarly, in most ways the Internet wasn't a very good system in 1994.

What I think almost everyone is missing in this and the other thread is that hoarding money is just another type of investment. 
By foregoing consumption of resources now, you let others consume more resources. You effectively invest in the entire rest of the economy, like a universal index fund. If that economy grows, your purchasing power grows. You made a profitable investment. If the economy shrinks, your purchasing power declines because you made a bad investment.
This is of course assuming a hard money, like gold or Bitcoin.

That's a non-answer, like saying there are more sellers than buyers. Sure, but *why* aren't there enough people to buy them? 
The real answer can only be guessed at, but there is one extremely obvious factor staring us in the face: the price went up 100x past year, which is about 10x faster than the historical average. As variance around a long term exponential growth trend, it makes perfect sense that if you spend some time ahead of the trend you'll soon spend some time behind the trend. The price being where it is isn't noteworthy. If we're still in the low hundreds 6 months from now it will start to get noteworthy, though not yet alarming.
The fact that money pouring into mining and venture capital has continued to soar in 2014 further supports this: investors who want bitcoins are obtaining them through other methods than actually buying them. As the mining and startup spaces become saturated, that exponentially growing tide of investors will be forced to buy bitcoins directly, bidding up the price.

It really is classic doublespeak, where the authority figure takes advantage of an ambiguity in language to wrap what they want to say ("encryption is illegal") in the veneer of a statement that's hard to disagree with ("properly encrypted files cannot be surveiled or used by law enforcement"). 
*Beyond the reach of the law* can be interpreted either way, but authority figures have the luxury of using whichever interpretation suits their needs. When the question is in dispute, the authority will argue that "of course we can't break strong encryption (of course you're putting yourself beyond the law)," and then when you agree they'll say you agreed to the other interpretation that "you're putting yourself beyond the law (what you're doing is illegal)."

In his Regression Theorem, Mises is talking about money as defined as a memory system using the exchange of physical objects (or notes legally redeemable for such objects). *Under that definition*, bitcoins are indeed not money. 
Rather, Bitcoin is a memory system that does away with the need for such "money" (originally industrially valuable physical media of exchange). Physical media of exchange like gold were just a low-tech way of performing the memory function that Bitcoin performs better. Hence Bitcoin is not money in the Austrian Economics sense and the Regression Theorem has nothing to say about it. It is pure memory without the physical tokens. It does everything for society that Austrian money did, but without the inconveniences of physical media of exchange, so of course now it would be practical for Austrians to define money more broadly to include any system of recording who gave value to whom, not just the low-tech sneakernet version of this system that uses exchange of physical objects.

Bitcoin isn't designed to be deflationary *as a currency*, just stable. Keep in mind that there is no possible way for the price not to blow up during the adoption phase, but that is not the currency phase but rather the investment phase (despite some very early adopters already using/promoting it as a currency). Once it reaches worldwide adoption, the "deflation" will only be equivalent to economic growth, which makes it no more deflationary than gold.

Since burning coins merely makes all the other coins more valuable, the purchasing power of the burned coins *is* going to the miners, and the nodes, and to everyone who holds bitcoins, in proportion to how many they hold.

New *protocol*, not new ledger. The protocol for updating the ledger is where the problem lies, if there even is one. The ledger itself will continue because every holder wants it to continue and it'd have to get horribly messed up for that to change (a few double-spends won't cut it, because there's no competition to speak of *in ledgers*, and their shouldn't be).

Not this fallacy again. Block subsidy is baked in, not new information an investor must deal with. If Bitcoin was a good investment in 2013 when it was known that the block subsidy wouod continue to be 25 BTC per ten minutes in 2014, the fact that that block subsidy remains in 2014 suddenly makes the investor want to sell?? "Doing the math" with incoherent assumptions isn't helpful. 
Said another way, the inflation rate is baked into the price, thus transactions aren't "costing" investors anything besides the normal tx fees.

Eventually a peg to the market price should more or less auto-adjust the price of asset issuance, and this will always be large enough to prevent spam, but there will never be more XCP than there are.

That's intuitively tempting, but no. If everyone's savings were magically doubled today, the price of everything would very soon be bid up to twice what it was, and it'd basically be a wash. Instead of new cars being $30K they'd be $60K.  The rich would not benefit more than the poor, unless they cottoned on to what was happening faster than others did.
Similarly if everyone's savings were magically halved. 
The problem with inflation is that everyone's savings aren't magically increased; the companies closest to the money spigots (gov contractors) get it first before the prices have been bid up.

I don't think the 11% money supply inflation is at all comparable to 11% inflation in a currency (Bitcoin isn't a currency yet - it doesn't have *currency*), because there's been an average of about 1000% price growth offsetting that thanks to exponential adoption. If that average yearly growth slows to anything in the ballpark of 11% before mainstream adoption happens, Bitcoin is done anyway. You're right that the next halving will be a big boost, but investment return-wise Bitcoin is nothing like a currency that is inflating at 11% per year.

Taking away some regulations but leaving the centralized control isn't comparable to a total lack of central control. For example, given that a monopoly has been granted to a food company, taking away a regulation that requires it not to charge more than a certain amount for food could be disastrous. Decentralization isn't deregulation of a centralized system, it's regulation by a decentralized one.

It's always astounding to me, every time the "troll" issue comes up, how some people say the trolls are all around and messing everything up, and I think to myself, "Wait a minute. I  read a lot of these threads pretty carefully multiple times a day, and I can't recall seeing more than a couple odd trollish posts or side debates in the past few days."
I suppose the refrain will come that they're "Leading the impressionable newbies astray." This is ultimately just another way of saying that we need to have a group whitewashed of all disagreement. 
"Oh perhaps it would be OK if the newbie were to see an opposing view, provided it is immediately slammed down and the opponent doesn't stubbornly talk back or make any argumentative fallacies or get arrogant or sarcastic." Do we really wanna go there? 
In most cases the trolls are bringing up some of the very reservations and lingering objections the newb has but is too afraid to ask about. And it's not like a newb means a person without a brain, who can't spot a desperate or fallacious argument where someone is grasping at straws and making emotional claims, moving the goalposts, etc. The end result of shielding newbies is to create a stock of bitcoin converts who don't really understand the answers to all the objections people raise.

Imagine 100 people dancing on a riverboat. Some influential dancers can temporarily sway others to follow their moves. However, to keep the boat from tipping over people need to stay in a balanced distribution. If one dancer is so awesome that he or she can entice too may people to one side of the boat, it could tip over. 
However, this concern assumes that not many people really care about tipping over the boat. More importantly, the boat can split into two boats and float just fine, although the one with the errant dancers left on it would likely capsize, killing the cool dancer as well.

The confusion arises from the marketing that "Bitcoin is a currency." Bitcoin (the blockchain) is actually just a ledger, with bitcoins just being the name for the units of account in that ledger. The word *bitcoin* just refers to a 1/21,000,000 slice of that ledger. 
So people who want to separate the currency from the blockchain really want to separate the ledger from the ledger, which is nonsensical. 
Now for completeness of the argument it is conceivable to have a blockchain that records data but that isn't a ledger, but the whole point of a blockchain is trustlessness through decentralization. That means there must be an economic incentive to run the system and also that it must be very expensive to attack it. Those incentives can only be achieved through scarcity, which ultimately means a ledger/token. That's why even non- currency applications of blockchain technology, such as cryptographic notarization, will always run on top of the ledger blockchain, not in some separate non-ledger system.

The reason being that most people don't understand economics, especially state university-educated economists. Perhaps worse, they think they do understand.
Also, it's quite possible to make a game where players simply have no means of performing basic economic functions, like speculation and insurance services. With some strictures in place preventing natural economic development, other strictures become necessary.
Edit: Finally, if the company wants to monetize the gameplay in certain ways, they're much more comfortable having a controlled economy so they can confine the outcomes to those that (they think) will be most profitable for the company.

While you're correct that the two charts have significantly different buy indicators in the rainbow bands, it would be the standard (non-logarithmic) chart that is more misleading. Such charts should usually only be used for short-term analysis or for assets where the price doesn't move up or down that much. 
In an asset that has shown massive growth like Bitcoin, non-log charts introduce extreme bias by making the recent movements look way more volatile than past movements. Log charts show volatility with no such bias. Log charts should be the standard, with the regular charts only being used for special short-term situations where an asset has been more or less stable or rangebound.

Not to nitpick, but the "why do the rich stay rich?" question comes up a lot recently and it's important to have the correct answer: the ultra-rich can influence governments to rewrite the laws in their favor, introduce regulations that hobble their competition, etc. The merely rich (multi-millionaires not billionaires) just tend to stay rich because they have good money management/business/investing skills and have plenty of spare capital when opportunity knocks. Plus the fact that they prioritize being wealthy over short-term luxury spending. Diversification helps, too, but it's more of a last resort than the primary driver of the "rich stay rich" or especially the "rich get richer" phenomenon.

By far the most obvious reason for the price drop in 2014 was the incredible price rise in 2013. Though it's almost a cliche, markets really don't move in straight lines. Historically the price has been very strongly up and very strongly down over longer periods than a year (usually the downtrends last longer), all within the context of historically unprecedented 5-year growth. It's easy to lose sight of the big picture. Anything else is mostly window dressing. Merchant acceptance, if it has any negative price effect, is going to be nowhere near those levels of change arising purely from the bubble cycle.

Weird response. The first link shows Nxt in an unfavorable light compared with Counterparty, and even mentions that Counterparty was the "first ever trustless distributed digital asset exchange" even though it got started months after Nxt did. [EDIT: Checked it again and it now looks more favorable for Nxt; seems there's a bit of an edit war in their wiki.] The second link has a bunch of things - like anonymous transactions - listed as "in development" for Nxt and "No" for Bitcoin and Counterparty...*as if these aren't in development for Bitcoin and Counterparty*. Pretty obvious the chart is just meant to spin Nxt as better, and is at several points intellectually dishonest.
That said, I hear the Nxt digital goods store is opening soon, which if done properly will be a major breakthrough. But at this point Counterparty seems to be kicking ass, and doing it in less time with far less hype, not to mention with zero fundraising or premine/instamine/ninjamine/IPO or other shenanigans.

1) Any additional coins sitting on the ask side of an exchange will tend to push the price downward. (This is where your "humans don't behave like quantum particles" objection would come in, yet I don't think this fact of markets is controversial.)
2) Proof of burn guarantees the coins can never be there.
3) Very few people sit on their coins forever. For each order of magnitude that the price rises, people typically sell off the vast majority of their holdings. But burned coins can never be sold off. The burned coins are then coins a certain percentage of which would have been available for sale but aren't. See

He got that part slightly wrong: 
*  Bitcoin is currently terrible as a general medium of exchange since 99.99% of merchants don't accept it (however it is good in certain niches). This will remain true until mainstream adoption.
* Bitcoin has been the best store of value in the history of the world in terms of rewards for holding it long-term. Still since it's not certain that Bitcoin will survive, it's not nearly as reliable as gold. And the short-term volatility could put you in a pickle at times if you rely on it to maintain this value storage function at all levels of time granularity. However, it is far more accessible, transportable, deniable, and protectable than gold. Overall it's a grand mix of amazing store of value functionality combined with some major exceptions. It comes down to the situation and reason for wanting a store of value.
* Bitcoin isn't a unit of account outside certain very niche cases, and won't be until full mainstream adoption. 
EDIT: Nevertheless, his point stands that it's silly to critique Bitcoin for not being a money/currency yet. It couldn't be, and people are confusing what it will become if successful with what it is now. It's like going up to Mark Zuckerberg when he was building facebook in his dorm and saying, "This is useless, there's no one on it."

What does that even mean? Supposing Bitcoin was "intended" to be used as a currency, who says it should be used as a currency right now, rather than later when it everyone has some? Bitcoin is primarily an investment right now; merchants coming online are mainly useful because they let holders prudently lighten their Bitcoin-heavy portfolios by purchasing stuff as the price rises rather than having to sell on exchange. There's no reason to push the currency angle before it's ready - it just invites backlash.

You should readjust your portfolio just a bit, or else I dare you to try to hold through the inevitable volatility. If you're like just about anyone else, you'll end up panic selling and losing more money in the long run.
For example, if you had $20,000 to your name and invested $5000 in bitcoin and it rose to constitute 95% of your assets, that means that with $315,000 in total assets you're a ~~tenth~~ **third** of the way to being a millionaire right now but if Bitcoin fails you'll be back to only $15,000. Do you really feel like you can take that kind of pressure during scary news, hard forks, government bans, and other knifedowns?
EDIT: Oh wait, you started with only 5%? 5% of $20,000 is $1000, so you'd be at $19,000 / 5% = $380,000 in bitcoins, plus your other assets of $19,000. So in that scenario you're at $399,000 net worth but back to as low as $19,000 if Bitcoin goes to zero. About equally scary but hopefully I got the math right this time.

I think it's a matter of presenting the argument as "Switch to Bitcoin for better shopping" vs. "Shopping is better in a Bitcoin world." 
The benefits of a given person making the switch to Bitcoin for shopping in a fiat money world are marginal and/or questionable in most cases, at least right now. What isn't so questionable is that if *everyone* used Bitcoin the benefits would be tremendous, in shopping and of course many other areas. 
So there is an important distinction between arguing that one person should use Bitcoin for shopping and arguing that we'd all be better off using Bitcoin for shopping. One is a direct call for consumer adoption, while the other is a forward-looking call more for entrepreneurs and engineers to build a Bitcoin world.
These two ideas get conflated because they sound similar in the phrasing ("everyone should use Bitcoin for shopping"), resulting in a lot of debate due to misunderstanding.

I think the "forget currency" meme is a sort of social phenomenon. Bitcoin as money is a touchy or even dirty subject, since it's related to investment and missing out and perceived unfairness. Money is the root of all evil, the saying goes. Bitcoin as technology is something easy to champion without sounding like a shill, and by the same token the former skeptics have an easier time pivoting toward embracing Bitcoin by that channel as well. The currency aspect is too raw, too real, in other words too much of a socially hot potato for those out there promoting Bitcoin in the media.

But more pointedly, block rewards won't run out for many decades (and note that even in 20 years when they are "small" they will still be huge in real world terms because a bitcoin will be worth a fortune if it's still around by then).

Although those things may happen before year-end, if they happen without massively higher prices (because of massively greater number of *holders*), they will be premature actions and could backfire.
If you want to look forward to something, look forward to the next tenfold price spurt. As crass as it may seem, that is the key to the next stage at this point. We are still in the hoarding phase, and there's no shame in that. This is how a new money is bootstrapped.

Summary: Caricature the goals of various crypto-projects (or cherry-pick the most extreme ones) and use that strawman as a springboard for the author's own statist vision. 
I have rarely if ever heard the sentiment that everything will be trustless and that trustless is always better. Some systems will always need human judgment and human trust (though not centralized trust) to operate. But that doesn't take anything away from the fact that a huge number of things would be way better if they were made trustless. The emphasis in the community is on those things simply because that need is obvious and that is where the innovation is. It seems like the author is focused on those instances where people get carried away and has used that to hamhandedly argue against decentralization (blockchain-based voting for central government leaders and centralized laws - yippee!!). 
Skip to the last few paragraphs to get the gist of the article. The first sections are quite nice as an overview of Bitcoin 2.0 potential, even if the sentences are a little too chock-full of flowery verbiage for their own good.

Well it's a little more than just an image ad since it references a unique function Bitcoin can perform.

I'm so dissapointed that I read all the comments and didn't see one mention of Cantillion Effects. 
You're correct that the problem isn't inflation *per se*; the problem is that the newly printed money doesn't just get showered on everyone in the same proportion. Instead it goes to the corporations closest to the government. They get to spend the new money first, before the inflation has rippled through the economy, before prices have been bid up. 
While we might need a study to prove that wages go up after prices rise, but we don't need a study to know that government spending goes to government contractors first. They are the first bidders idding up prices.

It's really simple: Bitcoin WILL BE useful for shopping one day. That's one of the many reasons people are excited about it as an investment NOW. Only extremely early adopters are currently buying Bitcoin mainly to have a better shopping experience. Most people are investors. At present, that's why to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:05:32
The idea that Bitcoin is mainly supposed to be useful as a transactional currency (at this time) rather than as a store of value was popular for a while, but fortunately that misconception is waning. The timing was premature.
It's really pretty obvious that currently most people acquire bitcoins to hold them, not to enable them to purchase something. It will be a couple years before this changes - but when it does it will come on like a tsunami. Until then most transactions (primarily bitcoin holders buy stuff instead of selling, as a way of prudently dishoarding as the price increases) will funnel through payment processors like Coinbase and Bitpay and therefore won't show up on the blockchain.

On that one it seems that the bigger the financial reward for an attacker (destruction or profit), the tighter the security needs to be. A trillion dollar market cap Bitcoin probably needs a lot bigger mining network. Now whether there is an economic mechanism that really keeps the numbers in line is another question, but it seems likely to me. An attacking miner really is competing for share with other miners, so price for attacking really is a function of the block reward x price as difficulty adjust to the price. 
For what it's worth, I do think just wasting the energy (assuming the previous paragraph is wrong and the expenditure is gratuitous) is preferable to changing the protocol, just because of how important it is to people that Bitcoin not change its issuance schedule. There is, to me at least, a world of difference between "never been tampered with" and "been tampered with (for any reason)." Precedent can be a very powerful thing in group dynamics. 
Now if the social difficulties of that could be overcome and perhaps some kind of mechanism for hard forking that was very safe could be worked out, this could just be settled by a hard fork or something. Who knows what technologies and best practices will exist by the time it matters. But "religious reasons," and in some sense the term is fitting, are needless to say a formidable obstacle. I think investors mostly want the stability and easy-to-understand certainty, even at the cost of temporary inefficiency.

Luckily Bitcoin's present value does NOT come from its present ability to facilitate trade, but rather its future ability to facilitate trade along with its present ability to store wealth (among other things). 
That's what speculation is all about: people who believe they are good at anticipating how the market will value something in the future buy that thing now, aiming to earn a profit. If they are right, they get more money and more ability to serve this incredibly useful social function. If they are wrong, their ability to affect price discovery diminishes.

You can't have exponential growth without volatility, because of market psychology. You can't have exponential price growth without those who buy in early getting rich, because of mathematics. There is no technology that can cause the price of an asset to grow exponentially without the people who get it first being rewarded exponentially. No technology can break basic logic, and short of some kind of brain modification of the general populous no technology can enable exponential price growth without people panic buying and panic selling. Once people see the exponential trend, they pile in and it goes faster, then crashes. No way around it as long as people are people.

Perhaps lost in the noise is the fact that SEPA withdrawals continue to post in 4-6 weeks, and yen withdrawals post in at most three weeks. Bitcoin withdrawals have legitimate reason for a delay, even if that delay has been severely extended by incompetence.

If by speculation you mean short-term price chasing, then yes Bitcoin doesn't need such people. But it absolutely needs investors. Bitcoin simply isn't as useful at present prices as it will be at $100,000, for example. It's useful at any price, but the big uses will have to wait for much higher prices. Also note that long-term higher prices make Bitcoin more secure, incentivize more startups and more development of ancillary infrastructure, and generally get more people to learn about it.

Ultimately the explanation cannot be divorced from the purpose of the explanation. If you want to explain for the purpose of getting someone to understand why Bitcoin is revolutionary, there are some things that must be explained in detail (which can still be done in simple and clear steps), and some things that don't need to be. 
For example, anyone who isn't skeptical of mainstream mathematics merely needs to be informed that one-way hash functions are a thing, not schooled in how the mathematics actually works. People do need to understand the basic distributed ledger concept, since the mechanics of that directly translate into Bitcoin's innovative properties. If you try gloss over or dumb that down, people will bring up objections that they otherwise wouldn't have.

Bitcoin is absolutely the only game in town.

＞it's the cost itself that defines the level of security.
That single sentence destroys this thread. 
The higher the market cap, the more secure we want the network to be against attacks. But too many resources being used for security eventually becomes wasteful. If only there were a mechanism for making the resources spent on security just enough to completely disincentivize an attack. 
Oh wait, there is: mining profitability. Sure, sometimes mining power will run higher than necessary, but since this causes mining to soon become unprofitable, the wasteful situation won't last long. It's self-adjusting exactly as we'd want it to be. 
Therefore, when people marvel at all the electricity spent to maintain the network, what they're really marveling at is the giant market cap. This is what it takes to defend a multibillion-dollar network where anyone can participate on equal terms (if there are advantages for early stakers, like in PoS, this can be done away with, but at the cost of decentralization; I doubt *any* system will be able to overcome this conceptual hurdle).

Devil's advocate:


We have outside confirmation (Andreas Antonopoulos, etc.) that they really did have a problem with withdrawals. That it was due to their own incompetence doesn't contribute in any way to your tacit conclusion that the company is preparing to close up shop. MtGox being incompetent isn't anything new.


Again, Antonopoulos estimated it would take them several weeks to fix, due to their error-prone homebrew code.


Any long-time resident in Japan can tell you this was a given, due to landlord pressure. There is little tolerance for tenants that have any kind of disruption associated with them.


This has been typical MtGox behavior for years.


The community was calling for it and the Foundation is obviously looking to clean up their image especially with this happening on the heels of the Charlie Shrem allegations.


The video is old and he's not even in Japan now so doesn't want to be taken as supporting something he knows nothing about at the moment.


Lawsuits, lawyers telling them to stop releasing info willy-nilly. Couple that with the usual braindead communications department.
All in all pretty yawnworthy to be honest. There remains no real reason to suspect insolvency other than the fact that some people probably were able to defraud them of some BTC. Withdrawals in yen and via SEPA are flowing with only a few weeks' delay. 
MtGox has a history of incompetently muddling through in a consistently dissapointing but disappointingly consistent fashion. I think they'll muddle through this as well.

On a related note, how about bounties for open source software, disbursed not by particular people who have clout in the community per se, but by people who have reputation as fair disbursers of bounties. 
Even though I trust Gavin, I wouldn't want him to be the decider of whether someone gets a bounty for some work they did on Bitcoin - because political considerations would inevitably come into play. But if the OpenBazaar trust system works as advertized, several highly trusted anonymous experts in bounty disbursal may arise (some may even be core devs, but anonymous) and make the bounty system far more lucrative for capable devs.

The overhead Satoshi referred to with banks and Paypal doesn't just come from their centralized nature, but from their non-anonymous nature resulting in AML/KYC and other reporting requirements. Since the final clearing method was always fiat money, this could never go away...until Bitcoin. 
Although a bitcoin micropayment processor would indeed be centralized and bank-like in that way, so would need reputation, it wouldn't necessarily be bound by the other overhead costs. (Burning bitcoins on OpenBazaar would be an overhead cost at first, but once reputation was established the total overhead costs would be very low.)

The "merchant adoption causes downtrend" theory never made any sense other than as a possible explanation for short-term price movements. People obtain and hold a certain number of bitcoins because they want to have that number for a reason. Whatever that reason is, a new merchant adopting Bitcoin is almost certainly not going to diminish the force of that reason. Any bitcoins spent then become a hole that person now wants to fill by buying back, unless there has been some change in the underlying reason they wanted that number of coins. But that change had nothing to do with a new merchant adopting Bitcoin. 
Even if we suppose it had - even under this odd assumption that people had obtained bitcoins mainly in anticipation that they could be spent at various merchants - more merchants adopting Bitcoin should make them want even more bitcoins so they can spend them in more places. The idea falls apart even under the most generous assumptions.
Meanwhile, under the far more realistic assumption that people are and have been acquiring bitcoins primarily as an investment in their future promise (including e-commerce adoption) and perhaps as a deniable way to preserve some of their capital, it also makes no sense for people to say, "I was targeting an investment portfolio of 50% bitcoins and 50% dollars, but Dell is accepting BTC and I gotta have that new Alienware computer so now I'm gonna target 40% bitcoins and 60% dollars." Rather, even if this person decided to mess up their ratio a little bit by spending bitcoins and not dollars this time, they likely won't continue to do so. Assuming their investment outlook hasn't changed, they will either buy the bitcoins back or at least spend them less and less - especially if the Bitcoin price falls as that would skew their portfolio ratio of bitcoin to dollars even further from where they want it. (Remember that we're here assuming that the person is primarily into Bitcoin for investment purposes.)
So why do people all these primarily-investors spend bitcoins at all? Why not just sell them if their bitcoin-fiat ratio grows too large? Because selling on exchange can be difficult, expensive, time-consuming, and risky. *If* there happens to be something they were going to buy with fiat money anyway *and* they feel their portfolio is overweight in bitcoins, it becomes a no-brainer to spend the coins. 
Thus for the investors, merchant adoption becomes an alternative more efficient and cheaper way of selling/profit-taking in certain situations. As merchant adoption increases we should see less and less selling on exchange and more and more direct purchases. Nevertheless, the lightening of bitcoin holdings was going to happen anyway, as part of the inevitable price gyrations in the face of people's portfolio targeting.

Oligopolies cannot last without government support, and it's easy to see why: even if all the miners were to collude to jack up prices for their mutual benefit, the advantage of breaking the collusion agreement will always be greater because all the fees will be funneled toward the cheapest provider - that one mining contingent that decides to break the collusion agreement by selling their services for a bit lower. This is why profit markets trend toward zero in a free market. The incentive is for everyone to undercut each other as long as there is still money to be made at the lower price.

Your response seems to assume that a 51% attack could do things like steal the coins in your address. It can't. It could disturb the network and cause a short-term price panic, but I would look forward to such an event because it would drive better practices that would remove that particular Sword of Damocles hanging over the market. 
Bitcoin is still very much a long-term investment, not to be thought of as a bank account, as the monthly volatility remains much too high.

Nice visual, but Bitcoin isn't moving to a currency yet as it claims near the top. The lower average payment figures are more likely due to bitcoiners being less rich right now. When you feel rich, you tend to spend more. Deflation eventually induces spending, not the opposite.

There are many times in Bitcoin's history where you would be sitting on losses, yet most of the time you'd be sitting on immense gains. If Bitcoin fails it doesn't matter much when you bought in, it will all go to zero. If Bitcoin succeeds it doesn't matter all that much when you bought in, except you'll be a millionaire instead of a billionaire if you buy in later or at the recent bubble top, for instance. It's still early days, and timing the market is much harder than simply holding. Whether you were lucky to buy on a dip or unlucky to buy at a peak doesn't change the fact that without extensive experience you're very likely to lose money trading.

Your final post as of this writing in response to suggests that an attacker could just keep messing with the main fork, which is a scenario where the attacker attacks multiple times.

Millions perhaps, either way I don't see them bothering at this stage, and any botched operation on the market just puts money in accumulators' pockets.
To the point about markets not getting confused, investment markets are a different animal from consumer markets. Investors who are easily confused tend to lose money and have less and less effect on the market, whereas investors who  have insight tend to make money and have more and more effect on the market. By this continual process of winnowing/attrition a core group of holders have become a very astute bunch while the less astute are systematically sidelined. 
In general, for any kind of attack against Bitcoin, the key is to hit hard enough, early enough to overwhelm the system's ability to adapt and self-correct. I think that horse has already left the stable and is galloping far ahead of government awareness of the threat, but of course this is a judgment call since we cannot know for sure what governments are thinking.

The market is the mechanism that clears up confusion. Three-letter agencies can infiltrate static groups and spread disinformation, but spending billions of dollars in an attempt to confuse the market as well ads a whole new dimension of challenge. They could conceivably do something like this now, but it's doubtful they would bother. Only once Bitcoin is several orders of magnitude bigger would they be able to secure the budget for it, and by then it will be too late.

Co-opting all the mining pools in turn just eliminates pooled mining, and good riddance. A disinfo campaign *could* work in theory, but that's just magical thinking without considering all the angles of how it would play out. Remember that one screw up and they'd merely succeed in inoculating the system against any future disinfo attacks.

It's not the blockchain that determines which change address the coins go to, it's whatever utility you used to create the actual transaction. That utility could be a Bitcoin client, or even just a javascript webpage saved on your offline computer. 
If you use a Bitcoin client to redeem the paper wallet, the change will just go to another address controlled by that client on your computer. Unless your computer crashes and you haven't backed up the wallet, you're in the clear there and won't notice anything special happening. It will look like you expect: the coins you spent are of course gone, but the rest are still under your control. They are in different addresses now, but all those addresses are part of the client's wallet that is under your control.
However, if you simply do what is called a "raw transaction" with your paper wallet, where you use a utility to simply generate and sign a transaction from your address to another address or multiple other addresses, the change issue arises. Just think of it like you have to send all the bitcoins in your paper wallet address out all at once. If you only want to spend part of it, you must send the rest to another address under your control.
For example, open up [ in a tab and follow along below.
If you download this webpage to your offline computer/smartphone and put your private key and destination addresses into the forms, it will create and sign a transaction for you*. What you have to be careful of is that if you have 10 BTC in an address and wish to send 2 BTC to another address and you fill out the forms in that way, the form will automatically make your fee a whopping 8 BTC, sent to a miner. That is, whatever amount you'd think would remain in the source address actually doesn't, and since there's "nowhere else for it to go" it by default all goes to the miner. Obviously a nightmare waiting to happen (not for the miner, though :P), so be sure to double-check the fee before sending. 
What you actually want to do is create a second (or several**) more new addresses for offline use, and send the remaining 8 BTC to them. That way you retain control of them.
Once the transaction has been created and you're SURE everything is in order (and you included a fee, if necessary***), you can simply copy the Raw Transaction field onto a USB stick or whatever then take it to your online computer and paste it into the form at [
That site will then kindly broadcast the transaction to the network for you****. Monitor the address on blockchain.info or elsewhere to see the transaction come up and get confirmed. 
*It's going to need the transaction history of the source address, but you can get that by going to blockchain.info/unspent?address=YOURADDRESSHERE on your online computer.
**Several is best, since you'll have to do this every time you spend from your paper wallet.
***If the fee is too low, your transaction could hang for several days, which will tie up your money for that amount of time and then it will go back to how it was. There's a fee calculator around somewhere, but I think brainwallet calculates the necessary fee automatically.
****Don't worry, no one can figure out your private key by looking at the raw transaction. Think of it like a signed check, where your private key is the pen you used to sign it. Everyone can see that it was signed with the proper pen, but only you have that pen (because it has never touched any online device). This is the magic of cryptography that makes Bitcoin possible.
EDIT: Obviously this is for somewhat advanced users and requires great care. But there are few alternatives at this stage if you want to be able to have the completel security afforded by paper wallets and offline signing without having to deal with Armory (which can be testy) or pay for a Trezor. Try Armory first, and practice this with small amounts until you're 100% sure how everything works, if you go this route.

As a user experience, users would be able to just select options like "Maximum guaranteed time to ~~6~~1 confirmation: 10 minutes ...........0.001BTC (95% confidence)" or whatever, with the confidence calculated from statistics. In other words, the client estimates with 95% confidence that the transaction with clear will 1 confirmation within 10 minutes *if* that transaction fee is included.
I'd personally find this incredibly useful, and it looks like miners could profit handsomely.

This is a cool idea but it ignores the division of labor. Tipping is best when it's clever (well thought out) and sparse, with decent amounts given. Carefully chosen tips enable the most bang for people's BTC, and this requires each individual person's knowledge of their own favorite subreddits and their cultures to wait for and identify great tipping opportunities. There should be a guide for how to tip for maximum leverage in terms of "bitvangelizing."
It seems like the best comments/posts to tip are **new** ones where everyone wishes they could help out somehow but can't. Like when someone deserves more than just upvotes for their work, has unfairly lost something, or could help the community more if they only had something else that costs a bit of money. They key is that the onlookers are stricken with a sense of injustice they they can't do anything to help the person out or reward them.
I also think it's best *not* to explain how the tipping bot works, at least not right away. If someone else in that subreddit explains it, fine, but otherwise let that powerful dose of "WTF just happened?!" linger as long as possible.

You're absolutely right. Gold was basically a low-tech hack to do what Bitcoin does without having to keep a history, but now that keeping the history is easy there is no need to lug around gold or trust third parties to store it for you. 
Definitely read the Kocherlakota paper and past discussion here and on Bitcoin talk on this, because I think it is by far the superior way to explain Bitcoin. It does away with whole classes of objections that arise from focusing on "bitcoins" rather than the societal memory encoded in the transaction ledger.

Outlawing Bitcoin would be like outlawing the Internet in its inception. Governments today are richer now because of the efficiencies introduced by the net. Governments tomorrow will be richer because of the efficiencies introduced by Bitcoin. To ban Bitcoin is to allow other countries to steal your economic edge, just as banning the Internet would have been. 
Governments do not need to fear Bitcoin. It makes everyone wealthier, increasing the tax base. Everyone stands to gain. And illegal activities will happen with or without the ban. In fact, remember that the nature of the Internet is to treat censorship as damage and route around it. Censorship of value communication (Bitcoin) will just make it more resilient and limit government options even further going forward. 
Embrace the future, Germany, and let other less financially savvy countries take the economic hit instead.

To understand why the Bitcoin price moves, you have to first understand why it is valued so highly right now, and most people assume it's about present-day merchant adoption. It's not. Current merchant adoption is a tiny drop in the bucket compared to the store-of-value function that Bitcoin offers. This is just another way of saying that the vast majority of the people who bought bitcoins over the past few months did so for investment purposes, not in order to enable a purchase. When people are buying bitcoins so that they can buy other stuff more easily, we can start looking at merchant adoption. Until then some merchants accepting BTC is just a tiny indicator of future merchant adoption, which is the underlying reason for current-day investment valuation.

It's like we wouldn't want to downplay how awesome Bitcoin and the tech behind it is by calling it magic, but to most people - and to everyone at first - it may as well be magic.

I don't think anything too special happens when we touch the limit. Some people will notice confirmations take longer, and pay higher fees if they're in a hurry. Although the software issue might take careful planning, miners and the community at large can move on a dime to give more specially preferential treatment to higher fee transactions and furnish the needed information to the public, if needed. 
For example, someone could whip up a website or browser widget showing the average confirmation time for the transaction they're about to send, given the fee they select. The only reason this doesn't exist now is that it's not a big deal yet. Ideally fee market information would be built right into the client GUI, but an outside website would work. And anyone who doesn't use or know about this would simply have to pay a bit higher of a fee, since they wouldn't know the market price and would have to highball it to be sure.
Since confirmation timeis already quite variable, I don't see that there will be a big hew and cry about "delayed transactions," just more of a gradual build up of annoyance.

Humans' inability to think exponentially should never be downplayed, but in this instance it's just not relevant because raising the blocksize limit is easy and takes almost no time. It's not like there's all this development work that needs to happen in order to raise it (despite what some small-blockers claim), where we'd get caught in an exponential growth trap. Getting consensus is what's hard, but that also would take very little time once the issue is very pressing.

It seems to me that there is a communication gap here between users and miners, forcing this sort of blind "send fee and pray" price consensus model. There's a great market opportunity for a fee monitoring service (accessed or woven into clients) that lets users select fee bids that are likely to get them the speed they need for each transaction, on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Even fees of 0.01BTC may be common when speed is critical. Big profits for miners, big speed boost to those who really need it.
Edit: It looks like 10 min/confirmation is the max possible speed, so users would actually just be paying to lower the chance of delay. Still, certainty or high confidence in getting confirmations in a given time frame is often worth a lot.

The question I haven't seen answered is, what does currency mean in China? The announcement specifically mentioned protecting the yuan's status as *legal tender*, which means they want to make it clear that you cannot refuse to be paid in yuan. If the PBOC merely said that you can refuse to be paid in bitcoins and have to denominate everything in yuan, it would be a classic misunderstanding. 
After all, gold and apples are not considered currency legally, but that doesn't mean you can't accept payment in gold or apples, even if you aren't allowed to offer goods or services to be paid for exclusively in gold or apples (and not yuan). Why would bitcoins be any different without an explicit ban on using them in trade? I think this is just wait-and-see caution + some lost in translation and cultural differences.

For a handwritten paper wallet that can survive a house fire, deportation, arrest, asset seizure, etc. you need to have backups in the cloud *and* memorized. Or rather, storing in the cloud inevitably entails memorizing something. With that, for ultimate security I can see an argument for just memorizing one single password or phrase, to avoid human error.
If there is a way to sign transactions completely offline without trusting anyone at all (not even Armory), some pen-and-paper tech, I'd like to know about it. Because that would eliminate the final worry about paper wallets, that you could lose them when you try to spend part of your nest egg.

While Coinbase probably is the leader as far as legit Bitcoin sites go, experience shows they could mess up at any time and lose everyone's money. 
I say if people are dealing with sizable funds, or price growth causes their holdings to become sizable, they should take the time to learn how to secure it themselves. As difficult as security and proper handling of bitcoins is, at this point investing the time to really learn it is the least bad option. Tons of newbies relying on Coinbase, blockchain.info, or an exchange for a susbtantial portion of their assets is a recipe for disaster (and PR hellstorm).

I'm now convinced that this kind of "memory" approach is the easiest route to really explaining Bitcoin in way that will obviate all the silly objections people come up with. So many of those objections are based on misunderstandings, which are probably the fault of those who explained Bitcoin to them. By trying to simplify and shoehorn Bitcoin into some easier, familiar category we set people up for having second thoughts later.
Keeping track (memory) of who owes whom how much is surely the *simplest* way to transact in a society, provided it can be done without any hitches. Unfortunately, until recently the technology to make this *practical* on a large scale didn't exist: updating all records in a distributed ledger would've been way too slow and required constant attention and physical proximity, and centralized recordholders would've needed way too much trust. 
Although modern technology now solves all these problems, in the meantime it is understandable that people used physical media and later centralized trust systems with all their disadvantages. They had no choice; the technology just wasn't there yet.
However, since we now have the technology for *trustless* public ledgers (memory) because we have solved the logistical problems that rendered distributed ledgers impractical for millennia, we can dispense with the unteleportable, difficult-to-conceal physical tokens and the overbearing, eminently corruptible centralized controllers. 
In a way, Bitcoin is a return to simple family accounting where no one needs to worry about mistrusting anyone else - but this time not because we trust each other but because trust doesn't even enter into the equation. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:17:46
Now that you're here, let me give you a more technical explanation. 
Bitcoin is actually a magically uncheatable accounting ledger in the sky, listing everyone's accounts and what percentage of the Bitcoin economy they command. The only person who can move the money in your account is you, via magic waves carrying your unique signature. Having 10 bitcoins in your account means you control about one-millionth of the purchasing power in the Bitcoin economy. If Bitcoin takes over the world, that would be about one-millionth of the global non-magical economy. The cost to take such a position now is about $2600, and the former VP of facebook thinks that could be worth $5-10 million in a few years ($500,000-$1,000,000 per bitcoin).
Bitcoin: magical and profitable.

The difference is this is extremely recent and there's no possible way people have been able to buy in yet. If they are to buy in, that wave is yet to come. An oft-stated delay time after news buzz is 2-6 weeks. It takes that long for people to research it and get money to an exchange, etc.

Basic economics says the price will adjust. It's impossible to run out of bitcoins, even if 20.9 million of them were lost, because they can be made infinitely divisible (no inflation, just smaller and smaller units). One singular bitcoin is enough to run the world economy.

About wealth distribution, what I think you're missing is that the later an altcoin was introduced the more established the whole idea was and hence people were willing to invest obscene amounts of money into them. Goat on Bitcointalk bought 500,000 litecoins all by himself(!). Mining is nothing next to what a wealthy bitcoiner (or old money) can simply buy, barring an extremely fast coin issuance schedule. 
Also the idea that early adopters just get richer seems a total myth. Some do, but only because they know what they're doing or got lucky. Unsung are all those who cashed out when their initial investment doubled.

Agreed on the first point, but Litecoin is not like silver. Since it is trivially easy to exchange cryptocurrencies, there is never much reason to spend litecoins instead of bitcoins. Soon apps that automatically route through a p2p cryptocurrency exchange will let you "spend" any marketable coin at any merchant that accepts bitcoins (or any other cryptocoin). You'll even be able to show the prices in your preferred coin. The merchant will know nothing of it. 
The value of Litecoin to the world is as a hedge for Bitcoin, a better tumbler for bitcoins, a backup in case Bitcoin goes down temporarily or permanently, and a testnet that can help anticipate potential issues in the Bitcoin network. 
Note: There is, nevertheless, no worry of endless proliferation of new cryptocurrencies, even though Litecoin is useful, because the marginal value of a third or fourth cryptocoin for the above four uses falls off rapidly. (A second or third tumbler, testnet, hedging mechanism, and backup system are less and less useful, so will command lower and lower market caps, meaning lower and lower inflation. In fact most of the inflation that altcoins will bring has probably already happened.)

1. Large central governments are on their way out, whether we like it or not.

The environment that spawned and nourished Leviathan is simply not what it once was, and the pace of that change is accelerating.
2. Don't confuse government with governance. You implicitly argue for (the maintenance of) a monopoly on governance services. You argue for a monopoly on policing, firefighting, adjudication, and road-building services. Why not a monopoly on food, water, housing, etc. like in the Soviet Union? Are governance services somehow more essential to our survival?

The rising price doesn't get worse on a percentage basis, which is all that matters. I agree that Bitcoin isn't working well as a currency yet, but that is mostly because it doesn't have "currency" - there aren't enough people using it, partly because of inertia and partly because it is still very difficult for the average person to use. The price is not a big deal (risk management demands dishoarding of bitcoins as the price rises; see the major spending uptick during the last bubble).
Bitcoin is working fantastically as Gold 2.0.

Healthcare: you must be joking. It's the biggest clusterfuck of them all. The government bids up prices ridiculously high and then convinces you it's doing you a favor by paying your hyperinflated medical bills (with money taken from you and the very people that would otherwise have used it to make society more wealthy).
People with a sense of self-responsibility aren't bad at money management. It's the "safety net" that destroys that, at a tremendous cost.
You also keep harping on DATA. Well guess what? Most data is from the government and the government-funded university system. Stop looking at supposedly reliable data and start actually thinking. Welfare doesn't help the poor; quite the opposite. Check out the book Losing Ground, by a former welfare proponent. It shows that welfare has been an unmitigated disaster. What is happening is the wealthiest countries can *afford* to waste money and destroy its poor citizens with welfare, not the other way around. Data will only give you correlation. For causation you have to think critically, which is almost impossible after years of government indoctrination.

Bingo. This is what I call the Early Adopter Paradox. Early adopters find their small investment now worth millions, but many of them won't sell much of it simply because bitcoin is the superior form of wealth preservation *even if the price falls quite a lot*. 
After owning bitcoins, dollars in the bank seem alarmingly precarious: your account can be frozen at any time without a trial, indefinitely, and moving your money around can attract IRS interest. Not to mention bail-ins (which central bankers agree are pretty useless unless they are done without warning) and the loss of the dollar's reserve currency status resulting in sudden massive dollar devaluati on. Oh and it's even harder to move it across borders. Also, estate taxes. Probably much more. 
When Erik Voorhees was asked at what price he plans to cash out, he replied, "I've already cashed out." I used to think that was a bold and maybe even flamboyant response; now I see it just makes sense. Of course a little fiat money is a good idea, as well as other assets spread across jurisdiction, but altcoins may be the best diversification nowadays, as ironic as that feels to write. If you believe cryptocurrencies are here to stay whether Bitcoin succeeds or not, it makes quite a bit of sense.

I concluded that there are so many people watching what's going on for any kind of abnormality - after all, the fortunes of everyone rest on this - that it would have to be something quite extraordinary for it not to be caught, if indeed such a thing were even possible in practice.
Supposing it did happen, there would be a selection of forks. The "fuck it!" fork would just carry on, chalking up government actions to fate (recall that they'd be fairly small corruptions). There might be something reverting all the way back to before the corruption, and various forks that attempt to remedy the corruption in as fair and simple/objective way as possible. Each will have their supporters, and eventually the most popular one will prevail and things will continue, if with a dampened mood for a while as whatever allowed the corruption to happen is fixed. Antifragility at work.

Good post, but a nitpick because I'm seeing this error a ton today: 
The problem isn't hoarders; the problem is "hoarders" who just want to make a quick buck because they don't understand the fundamental value proposition. Hoarding by strong hands who know what's up is completely good, not in any way bad for Bitcoin. It increases the base price and raises the base market cap, thereby decreasing average volatility. That makes Bitcoin better as a currency.

So I guess the only real security most people have in that area is that they can cross-check that the private key corresponds with the address using various independently created tools.

Others are right that paper wallets are safest, but you have to understand them first before you try to spend from them, especially about the "change address" gotcha. Actually even before you generate one. 
So I'd first sell a few of those BTC so you don't freak out, enable 2-factor on Coinbase, then get to doing some serious research on wallet security. Once you feel comfortable, take ownership of the coins. Remember the first rule of Bitcoin: If you aren't the sole holder of your private key, *you don't own any bitcoins*.

Yeah and I think that's excellent. The market is correcting people's mistakes in perception and people's mistaken billing of Bitcoin as a currency (as a currency now). It can become a currency, but it has to pass through a protracted melt-up where its wealth preservation/growth aspects shine. In the meantime it will be useful as currency only in more niche and roundabout ways, like when someone is feeling Bitcoin-heavy they can make purchases in liew of selling (can be quite convenient and could become rather commonplace as many investors feel rich now) or it may be used in otherwise very difficult situations like black markets or cross-border transactions with unbanked people/businesss.

In other words, Bitcoin is like a society that has certain rules and people are not forced to join. Since everyone joined voluntarily, most people can be assumed to prefer most of the rules and the ideals behind them (scarcity is sacred, irreversibility is extremely important, etc.). Therefore, a preponderance of members should only want to break the rules if there are very very very extenuating circumstances that make breaking the rules seem like the only way to hold to the larger set of ideals that constitutes Bitcoin.

That may be true, but the bigger picture to me and why I wrote the OP is that the Bitcoin ecosystem is confirming its suspected anti-fragile characteristics. To me this means that even if some of those in their temporary positions of power (devs, mining pool operators, forum mods, etc.) managed to conspire to harm the system, they'd likely only get one chance. After that, the system would probably restructure to avoid such a possibility in the future. The same could be said for almost any kind of attack scenario. 
I don't think Bitcoin is invincible; in fact I'm going to be just a little bit surprised if it actually succeeds. However, I think it's going to take a gigantic, fatal, very *sudden* problem or wildly unanticipated "perfect storm" to defeat it.

The deflation objection to Bitcoin is wrong twice over.
1) Bitcoin won't be a currency until most people are using it. Once most people are using it, it will no longer be significantly deflationary. Until then it's mainly a wealth preservation and payment system. Bringing up deflation now is a moot point.
2) Deflation isn't bad anyway, and it doesn't discourage spending. In fact it encourages it because of the wealth effect, once people reach their saturation point. The fact that Bitcoin isn't being used much as a currency now has nothing to do with deflation, but with the fact that it has greater utility right now as a store of value since few people accept it. To make the argument that deflation reduces spending, it is insufficient merely to point to low Black Friday numbers. You'd have to show that spending increases in bear markets and decreases in bull markets. Of course the opposite is the case.

Says who? Says hundreds of millions of dollars up for grabs for the past few years for anyone who could counterfeit it.
He's right though that Bitcoin is currently a "failure" as a currency; that's to be expected as a currency takes times to gain, well, currency. It should be marketed a Gold 2.0, backed by the eventual promise of becoming a currency once it overcomes inertia and network effects, since it is vastly superior on both fronts. That would short-circuit claims that it is failing or that it's too volatile, and help people understand what drives the price. What drives the price is more people understanding Bitcoin's present superiority as Gold 2.0 and future promise as Currency 2.0. Merchant adoption does help, but until we are seeing major league adoption this only drives the price because it reinforces the future promise, not because it boosts current transactional utility.

Also, before you put your money into a blockchain, you want to know for sure it is secure. You want the most scrutinized, stress-tested blockchain with the longest track record, the most mining power, the best development team, and greatest number of people with a strong vested interest in keeping it running perfectly.

The main cognitive error to watch out for when prediciting catastrophe is that of *ceteris paribus* presumptions: looking at one factor and assuming that as it changes nothing else will.
In some cases this involves argument from lack of imagination, where the predictor cannot envision how a novel situation will incentivise new behavior that will mitigate the foreseen problem.
Peak oil and other Malthusianism is a great example of this error. As resources become more "scarce," they command a higher price, making previously impractical sources become practical (i.e., profitable) and inducing more efforts toward searching for more. (See

As a deeper philosophical point, sure humans are collections of cells that all themselves can be said to act in some way, maybe even be conscious in some sense. But the distinction Austrians make is about individual humans vs. groups of humans. Austrians would prefer to say that groups of people show emergent patterns of behavior, but not that they "act" when the majority coerces the minority or whatever. To speak in such a loose way throws the minority under the bus. Worse still is extreme collectivist phrasing like, "China attacked Russia," which is unfortunately very commonplace.
Yet it is true, as referenced in the final episode of the original Prisoner TV series, that the human consciousness is composed of many "committee members." This is an important point as well and should not be ignored, but I don't see a practical reason why the methodological individualism of Austrian economics should be questioned for such reasons - unless we are also planning to arrest one personality in a person's mind for subverting another one(!). This is just too abstract for endeavors like understanding how the price system works or what result central bank inflation will produce. The limitations on the theory are what make it practical to use at all. Believe me, Austrian economics is difficult enough to work out even with these limitations - it can be argued that no Austrian economist, not even Mises, has ever successfully adhered to the methodological framework he laid out; if more nuance of individuals being made of mini-personalities and cells were included economists would never get anything done.


This is a problem, and addressed by the Austrians. They are almost always very explicit about where and when economics applies.

Strictly speaking it means that 20,000 BTC are suddenly not for sale (for the moment), so that anyone wanting to buy will have to bid for a smaller pool of coins, necessarily pushing up the price. However, of course there are many other buys and sells happening at the same time, so there's no way to know which way the price will actually go in aggregate. Basically it's a rather bullish sign, on its own.

The absolute worst case scenario is every government on the planet bans cryptocurrencies completely.
Even in such an unrealistically dire scenario, Bitcoin would only be set back a few years. It'd still be used in online black markets, even if (again worst case scenario) it was only among people that already had BTC to trade. There would still be *some* backing and some base price support, even if it were only $1/BTC. 
And here's the kicker: millionaires and billionaires still need a place to hide their wealth securely, and Bitcoin still functions for that purpose. Even if they have to do it slowly on the black market by sending cash through mail little by little, they will still do it, and there will be people who build up reputation for performing this service. It will actually be pretty riskless once the market matures. Selling BTC may be harder, but still definitely possible.
It's simply a matter of incentives. It doesn't matter how illegal it is; rich people will always look for ways to secure their wealth, and the cryptocurrency cat is out of the bag. It's only a matter of time before it becomes conventional wisdom in every HNWI club that you put 10% of your stash in Bitcoin, should the absolute worst come to pass (arrested, all bank accounts frozen, all assets seized). 
While it's not often mentioned, with Bitcoin people can still access and move their money covertly and securely from prison. Until Bitcoin, that was a *very* tough trick to pull off.
With many wealthy people putting some of their assets in Bitcoin, the price will go much higher than it is now. Like offshore accounts, it'll be pretty hush-hush, but it will happen. 
Since it will retain backing in this way, eventually the black market will become so powerful that a few countries will find it a good move to legalize and adopt it, especially given the currency wars we are entering into now.

A few points:
1. You don't need to download the blockchain. For large amounts, paper wallets are the way to go, and for small amounts a lite client is fine. I think downloading the blockchain is recommended only because it helps promote the network by increasing the number of nodes.
2. Perfect security for a large stash is definitely somewhat of a nightmare right now, at least until you put in the necessary research. But confirmations are not part of that nightmare. For coffee shops, just waiting a few seconds for the transaction to appear on the network is safe enough. 
3. Not an issue. Divisibility will be dealt with as the need arises, many many new developers will be jumping on board even as some of the original ones get rich and lazy (but I assume most already are rich yet still working hard).

A bitcoin is a unit assigned to a given address in a public accounting ledger maintained by a globally distributed consensus system of computers that all implement the Bitcoin protocol.
Since there very roughly 10 million bitcoins in the system, a single bitcoin is actually just about 0.00001% of the total money supply in the ledger currently as specified by the consensus protocol.
In other words, if you have a bitcoin in a Bitcoin address that you have the private key for, you control 0.00001% of the total purchasing power in the Bitcoin economy because the consensus protocol dictates that your cryptographic signature, signed with that private key, is the only thing that can authorize the sending of that 0.00001% to any other address.

The "2.5 = 10" argument is weak sauce. Better to argue that if 2.5 minutes is better, why not 2.5 *seconds*? Obviously there are trade-offs, and until we know more about those tradeoffs, it makes sense to stick with the coin that has the longest track record and has been the most thoroughly scrutinized.

One of the meta-indicators that convinced me there was something to Bitcoin was how none of the detractors really understood it and made obvious errors. There was not a single detractor that made anything other than common economic errors, simple misunderstandings of Bitcoin, or semantic sophisms. Everyone who made actual decent arguments against Bitcoin always turned out to be Bitcoin supporters who just had some nitpicks or concerns.

And they don't even consider the cost. It was cool, therefore it was worth it. Nevermind what we sacrificed to get there and how much more efficiently it could have been done.

Fun to think about:
* Who's going to have access to the government auction where they sell them off? Those will be probably be a real steal.
* What if the price rises dramatically as the gears of justice slowly turn during which they aren't allowed to liquidate them, so that they're soon sitting on billions of dollars worth? Since such a price rise entails rapid mainstream adoption, will there be power struggle within governent as to how the funds will be allocated among the agencies?
* Feds try to transfer the coins to their own address, end up paying it all to a miner because they didn't know about change addresses.

Newcoin, even if so vastly superior on paper that it could overwhelm Bitcoin's network effect, would nevertheless not be an overnight success, due to having an untested and undeveloped infrastructure and plain old lack of historical track record. Instead, it would gain ground over the course of a year or more* giving bitcoiners plenty of time to gradually diversify into newcoins.
*Barring catastrophic failure of Bitcoin. However, if that were to happen, having a halfway decent backup system is a win for the cryptocurrency movement, not a loss. Note: this doesn't imply endless additional altcoins would be useful to have around, but one or two would be.

Crowding out:
Someone living in a hard-to-reach mountain hut gets "free" mail service by the USPS (actually they/we pay a ton, relatively, in taxes for it). If the USPS didn't exist, they would not get it "free," but they would get it for the market price to deliver mail to that location. And it absolutely *would* be profitable for a private company, since they'd be paying the market price. 
It would probably still cost less than what they're paying through taxes, but even if it were more, it's kneejerk to assume that's a bad thing. There is expense associated with living ridiculously far from civilization. To ask everyone else to subsidize that expense for you is pretty odd.

To understand why Bitcoin is good for the poor, you have to understand why the "rich get richer" in the first place. 
Aside from cases of natural entrepreneurial and investment talent and plain old interest in being wealthy, it is mostly due to centralized power, enabling things like lobbying by big corporations to enact laws that beat down their competitors, create tax loopholes for them while making tax law for the middle class airtight, and being able to wage wars that feed the military-industrial complex. Think millions or billions of dollars for FDA drug approval, patents, the copyright mafia, and even government foreign aid, which ironically ends up just fueling third-world oppressors and keeping the poor down. 
Except for a very elite few who are able to create genuine massive value for the general public, it's very hard to stay uber-wealthy without the centralized power that is the government giving you an unfair advantage.

I was about to disagree, because of the possibility of catastrophic glitches, etc., but then it occurred to me that when starting anew, Bitcoin is big enough now that the only really acceptable way to do the coin distribution would be to base it on the last stable state of the blockchain and probably also follow the Bitcoin protocol exactly in terms of coin release schedule. So it'd just be Bitcoin all over again, with all holders still holding, with the same protocol financially speaking, just with some non-financial tweaks to circumvent whatever the glitch was.
Bitcoin isn't a collection of coins, it's a ledger. Even if Bitcoin fails, the ledger lives on for a new incarnation to pick up right where it left off, with many people being none the wiser.

This is why I'm not really worried about a 51% attack or any other catastrophic failure of Bitcoin due to glitch, etc. 
When Bitcoin started the only way to get people on board was to give them equal opportunity to mine coins. Now there's a new option: give people a percentage relative to how many bitcoins they can prove they own, just by using the state of the blockchain an hour or a day before the disaster. No need for anyone to judge the proof or determine a distribution, just let people use their old private keys and wallets in the new system and continue mining from there. Completely automatic, good for an instant million or so users if the implementation is sound and backed by the right people (Gavin, etc.).
This option to rollback seems to turn catastrophe into a mere setback that would be remedied within months or a year - maybe even faster because it'd show how resilient the system is, adding a lot of extra confidence.

While I am convinced that peak oil is just another popular misunderstanding of economics, I fully agree with your main point. The economy we have now thrives exactly where and in those aspects in which it is decentralized. Just like the internet treats censorship as damage and routes around it, those decentralized aspects of the economy treat the centralized ones as damage and route around them.
Bitcoin decentralizes huge swaths of the economy even further than the internet did, providing all sorts of new degrees of freedom for decentralized pathfinding (finding paths to mutually profitable exchange and asset protection) to occur.

It's a little complex when you have to pay a fee, but yeah it's definitely not $3.50 per transaction. That would make me cry. It's very low and often free.
Going forward, note that in a frictionless market profit margins tend toward zero. That means once the infrastructure for bidding is implemented in the software, fees will tend toward the actual base cost a miner incurs in relaying a transaction (utterly dirt cheap, I assume).

Definitely. It [has been argued or speculated]( that the average holder sells 17% of their bitcoins for each time the price doubles.

Sooner or later, people will realize that the base value of any altcoin lies entirely in whatever support role it can play for Bitcoin. If it is below that value, the price will tend to increase until it reaches an appropriate value for those roles. All other price increases can only be seen as speculation that that altcoin will overtake Bitcoin as king. For the foregoing reasons, there is no existing altcoin that has a shot at that crown, barring a Bitcoin catastrophe.

This is actually a plus, not a minus, once you realize that no altcoin - no matter how superior - can become competitive with Bitcoin overnight. 
Let's suppose "Supercoin" comes onto the scene and blows Bitcoin away in every aspect feature-wise. It still cannot be trusted until it has a track record, and that inevitably takes *time.* During that time, there will be plenty of opportunity for bitcoin holders to diversify into it as it proves itself. Sure, it's a problem for Bitcoin itself, but it is not a problem for bitcoin holders.
Even if Litecoin were to be deemed decisively superior by the majority, it also has the track record problem, and there is still plenty of time for bitcoiners to get into it. Again no problem.
Of course, a catastrophic glitch in Bitcoin would likely push one or more altcoins into the forefront, so it's worth holding a few as a hedge even now, but again this is an example of altcoins conferring an advantage to Bitcoin users, not a disadvantage. Without any backup coin, the value of everyone's cryptocurrency portfolio is always in danger of going to zero.
Moreover, having at least one significantly valued altcoin actually increases value not only for bitcoin holders but even for the Bitcoin system itself: 
* Passing Bitcoin assets through an altcoin and back again is the ultimate form of tumbling, adding substantially to Bitcoin's privacy features. (However, additional altcoins confer less and less value here.)
* An altcoin allows for something like "shorting" BTC when the price runs up too fast. Especially since trades can be made without going through fiat (without even going through a central exchange, once a p2p altcoin exchange is set up), day traders can perform their role of smoothing out volatility by temporarily shifting some BTC into LTC, for example, much as PM traders trade gold for silver when it looks like gold has rallied too far. This is both helpful for keeping BTC prices rational + smooth *and* ensures that at least one altcoin will maintain some value. (However, additional altcoins confer less and less value here.)
* Finally, an altcoin functions as testnet to help anticipate problems in Bitcoin before they occur. The closer the altcoin is to Bitcoin, the more helpful for that. Conversely, the more dissimilar the altcoin is to Bitcoin, the greater chance of finding a "must-add" feature that may be able to be incorporated into Bitcoin anyway. (Here again, additional altcoins confer less and less value.)
As for inflation due to altcoins gaining market share, it is extremely limited because each new altcoin confers less and less value. Even if somehow four or five altcoins were to take on some significant valuation, it seems reasonable that the first (say Litecoin) couldn't exceed maybe 20% of Bitcoin's market cap, simply because the above value aspects wouldn't ever justify more than that. And a second altcoin might max out at 20% of that (4% that of BTC), and so one. That is a tiny amount of inflation in the grand scheme of things, and is probably way too generous of an estimate. In fact, most of the inflation due to altcoins has probably *already happened.*
One more thing to keep in mind on why cryptocurrencies may "compete" but holders don't need to pick favorites or worry about it: Once altcoin exchange infrastructure matures, browser plugins or similar will likely make it so that users can buy from any merchant that accepts Bitcoin, no matter what kind of coins they hold, with prices even being displayed in the altcoin of their choice and the merchant being none the wiser. Their altcoins will automatically get exchanged for bitcoins in the p2p market as they make the purchase. This is why Atlantis is unnecessary and the whole way most people seem to think about Litecoin is flawed. The most liquid coin will be the standard, yet exchange among them being frictionless will make this sort of irrelevant to the end user, other than as a consideration on how to weight their asset portfolio.
**EDIT:** TL;DR: Fear not the altcoins. They are our friends and can only help the cryptocurrency ecosystem that benefits us all. They are not "competition," but hedging, tumbling, testnet, and backup systems that add value to Bitcoin and/or to bitcoin holders. Most business will always be conducted in Bitcoin as the most liquid and stable coin, except if Bitcoin ever fails in that regard, in which can having altcoins around is again a blessing, not a curse. Because of the limited and rapidly decreasing benefit of additional altcoins for these aspects, there is also no concern of substantial deflation due to a proliferation of altcoins.

This is the first time in history that "gold" also operated as its own container and transporter (in a "Beam me up, Scotty" sense).
So the common conceptions of Bitcoin as a currency or store of value are at least two steps removed from a clear understanding of it. 1) It's not just one thing; it's all of the above. 2) It's all of the above in one package with each component inextricably connected to the rest.

I hope this doesn't come off as abrasive, but this post shows an almost total lack of understanding of basic economics and doesn't stand up to even the slightest scrutiny. Just put yourself in an early adopter's shoes. You started off with an average standard of living, and three years later you have 100,000 units of an experimental currency worth nearly $10 million. Yet at any time the price could go to zero due to a glitch or other problem. How many of these people do you really think are going thinking, "Yup, let it ride baby"? You'd so cash out a large chunk of it, and a larger chunk if it reached $100 million or a billion. Only the most insane gambler would refuse to do this.

They have total control over production and distribution of XRP. They first told us XRP was quasi-worthless tokens. Now that that's becoming a total joke as XRP market cap approaches that of Bitcoin itself, they decide to give us a butthurt look as we criticize their distribution scheme and act like it's some problem they're wrestling with. No, the problem was solved by proof of work (mining). Yes, proof of work has drawbacks, but it is THE innovation that allows virtual currencies to exist. The main "drawback" of proof of work is that it is antithetical to centralized control. OpenCoin is desperate to find a way around that.

Since money is just information, it's really just a completion of the Internet. It allows not only for free exchange of knowledge with implications far beyond swapping recipes, but free maintenance of economic relationships with implications far beyond cheaper online payments (though that by itself would be huge). 
The Internet without Bitcoin is something like a "free total united knowledge society," whereas with Bitcoin it's not just communication of knowledge but also value: the complete internationalization of the division of labor, freedom of economic association, and all of it frictionless as the knowledge internet came to be.

It seems the atomic bomb has had the extreme opposite, very decentralizing effect. I could see it having both aspects, perhaps. What are you thinking of in particular?
Although it seems at first glance like it could be the ultimate centralizer, looking at actual history the main effect of the A-bomb seems to be that any countries that get it immediately gain a much larger degree of autonomy over their affairs, and are much harder to invade or take over. What the gun did for personal freedom, the bomb is doing for national sovereignty. Not to mention that no two countries armed with nukes have ever had a hot war with each other (correct me if I'm wrong). Since war is the health of the state, it seems very decentralizing so far.

The questioner started with, "Bitcoin is just a technology, which can be tricked." That, followed immediately by "can you be robbed?" sounds like the questioner is thinking the technology itself can be "tricked" resulting in a theft. Tucker mentioned double-spending, which is the only known way the technology itself could be "tricked," and that kind of question indeed warrants a response like "I don't think so" ("I don't think double-spends or other tricking of the technology are a major concern.")

The non-aggression principle is one of my pet peeves because it purports to be libertarian but is actually completely stuck in the statist mindset. It is all well and good to be against aggression; the problem is various people define the word "aggression" in wildly different ways. In fact, the entire purpose of law is to limit violent disputes in society *by defining what exactly constitutes aggression.*
Consider the common law (market-formed, non-legislated law) on assault and battery. Do snatching a plate out of someone's hands, blowing smoke in their face, or making threats of imminent physical harm constitute aggression? In common law, they do. Meanwhile, threats of physical harm at an indefinite time in the future do not. Why the nuance? Because society at one point discovered through trial and error that punishing the former types of actions reduces the level of violent disputes, while punishing the latter generally had no effect or wasn't worth it.
The non-aggression principle is of no help here. Neither is voluntarism: everyone defines voluntary differently, especially when you already have to shoehorn the definition to fit getting detained for stealing as "voluntary." Neither is liberty, as - again - everyone defines it differently. The whole point of law is to define these words in various situations, contexts, and social milieus. And the whole point of anti-statism is to avoid assuming the legal system should be centrally planned and monolithic.
Why, for instance, should the same contract law apply to a carpenter getting a warranty on his car stereo as to large companies making business deals? There's a difference in the relative sophistication of the participants. It is all case by case, there is no simple guiding principle by which law can be simply derived *a priori*.
The non-aggression principle is a minarchist idea, firmly entrenched in the old statist paradigm where people "demand their freedoms" from their government. Sure, monopoly government could not exist if it did not use force, but it and its supporters will never call its own use of force "aggressive." The NAP is a dead-end idea, an appeal to confused minarchists to get them to become anarchists, but it only functions that way because it appeals to the minarchist mindset of central planning.
Without a central government, there's no one to force people to follow any one principle anyway. At best the NAP would be a prediction of how a stateless society would function, but insofar as it is a prediction, it is an empty one as it effectively just says, "the law in a stateless society will be better and more just." It is a contentless, statist, oversimplified, and finally useless platitude.
The way to understand law in a stateless society is to look at the highly nuanced and sophisticated body of non-legislated law that still forms the basis of the general peace and order in most of Western society. [This essay]( (edit: warning: PDF) is a good start to moving beyond the NAP.

I disagree that Bitcoin's difficulty of usage is a real problem. The sticking points are surmountable for many applications within the year.
However, I agree that consumers (except in certain niches like SR and VPNs) will not be the first group to really adopt Bitcoin. It will be people who need to protect their wealth against capital controls, inflation, and general surveillance, as well as companies like Western Union that can profit from using Bitcoin in their back operations. Also, any persons and companies who need to save money on remittances between countries, like any company with a branch in Nigeria.

You'd want the support of an ad agency that knows how to create engaging commercials and how not to get killed in the bidding process. Superbowl commercials are expected to be good. So it's going to cost an awful lot. Perhaps make a commercial first, then if it's good pay for Superbowl air time.
Still, I think a more targeted approach would be way more efficient. For example, an ad that targets migrant workers on a particular program, like a popular Spanish-language radio or TV show in the US. Or an ad targeting goldbugs who live internationally.

When libertarians say words like "sovereign" and "no force" it makes me think they're still stuck in the statist/minarchist paradigm, still thinking about their sovereign "rights" to do their own thing and make their own rules. The logical endpoint of such a philosophy isn't anti-statism but mountain-manism, where you go off and ignore the government...and everyone else. 
Bitcoin isn't merely about being able to ignore the government. Bitcoin is bigger than that. What Bitcoin does is decentralize power, with *all* the benefits that brings. It doesn't mean you get to live by your own rules, not even regarding your money: you are always at the mercy of the sentiments of the nodes in the network. If everyone decided to stop running Bitcoin, you'll see how much "sovereignty" you have over your money. They won't stop, but not because of any sovereign right you have to your money, but because Bitcoin is useful to them. Stably so. 
Likewise with society: you don't get to kill whoever you want even in libertopia. You will still be *forced* to pay the price for unprovoked violence and anything else your community loathes. Force won't go away, it will just start to be used in much more palatable ways from the point of view of most people in society, or at least those not brainwashed by government schooling and propanganda. It won't follow the Non-Aggression Principle perfectly either; rather, the NAP is simply an approximate codification of what people's sense of justice would probably look like if perceptions weren't being distorted by a giant central authority. 
Decentralization of power still leaves you dependent on society and the division of labor for almost everything you could want (unless you want to be a subsistence-farming hermit). It's just that it takes away the ill effects of centralized power that interest groups can use as a weapon against you, that makes everything so inefficient, that distort public opinion and law, that let parasite feed off all productive human activity, that all around bring out the worst in people. Decentralization is no more a benefit to individual liberty than it is to prosperity, security, stability, technological advancement, peace, justice, and the overall happiness of the population. It does all these things, because it ends the disease that is centralized power. Bitcoin is way bigger than just "personal freedom."
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:59:49

I ran the numbers and noticed it wasn't worth it in my life situation for me to cash any coins out until higher prices. Others may be different. I fully support people choosing to diversify a moderate percentage at the bubble valuations (and yes, I have been calling this an increasingly bubbly situation ever since Cyprus).
However, panic-selling *all* your coins right now - if you understand Bitcoin - is retarded for two reasons:
1) If you know Bitcoin's history and thought things through, there is no situation that should cause you to panic. You'd only be imvesting what you can afford to lose, and you'd be prepared to hold straight to zero. Why? Because...
...2) If you believe there is a signficant chance Bitcoin will reach mainstream adoption, you are not prepared to part with your *entire* stash at any cost. Especially not for a chance at a measley 400% gain.
The price could have easily gone an order of magnitude higher before MtGox melted down, for all anyone on the outside knows, and then bounced around in the high hundreds for several months while the exponential adoption curve caught up with the price. Hindsight is 20/20, but the unseen here is the many bubble callers who sold everything back at $9 (or at $0.90) when they looked at the price and said a digital Pacman pellet can't be worth that. They gambled and lost their chance to participate in what has been a multi-year historic bull market with much sharper corrections than these.

On 2, speculators actually profit from oscillations by evening them out: "buy the dips, sell the peaks" is the most basic and common short-term trading strategy. This naturally makes peaks lower and dips higher: more stability.

Also difficulty of having it stolen or confiscated, or of people even knowing you have it in the first place, should be a characteristic of good money.

Here's what happened: Someone fiat tycoon put up a huge bid wall. It was there for a while, then finally some Bitcoin tycoon took advantage of this delicious opportunity to liquidate some coins. 
Why delicious? Because in the recent low-volume market, selling that many BTC would have caused massive [slippage]( and possibly panic. With this big bid wall in place, the seller could just eat through it at mostly the same price without losing money to slippage and without spooking that market more than necessary.
Basically it was whales humping :)

The comparison between Bitcoin and Paypal/wires for fees on a $6,500,000 transaction made me think it'd be cool to have a graph plotting the difference in % fees for transaction of all sizes, from the very small to the very large. That would sum up the fee advantages of Bitcoin in a single image, both precisely and at a glance, so that people interested in micropayments could see exactly where the sweet spot Bitcoin carves out is, and tycoons who want to move vast sums behind the scenes could see exactly how much they'd save.

Yes, this is the preferred path. The government doesn't regulate the Internet that much because it is addicted to its revenue. The same is happening with pot, and the same can happen with Bitcoin. The government simply wants its cut; it doesn't care about the future. In this case that's a plus.

*Evade --&gt; Avoid. It is perfectly legal to buy stuff with BTC instead of cashing out, and that incurs sales tax but not capital gains tax.
Another reason: Assuming a Bitcoin-enabled merchant has something you want for a decent price, it's cheaper, faster, more direct, safer, and less of a hassle than cashing out on an exchange before buying.
Also, a meta-reason: People do this as the price rises because they note their portfolio is too bitcoin-heavy.

The only slight hitch I can see with tipping physical products is that most would be rather expensive for a tip, especially with shipping. Some quick ideas for solutions:
* Allow multiple people to contribute partial amounts to the fund, kickstarter-style. This kind of crowd-charity is deeply woven into the reddit culture already, but until Bitcoin and the tipping bot it had been very hard to execute. 
* Perhaps there are some cheaper online-only goods that could be tipped, like single song downloads or domains or something. Ideas?

I think these attempts at control will just be routed around.

I don't think currency use matters much until we start hitting the mainstream. Bitcoin is an investment; like all investments the idea is you put money in to fuel future developments based on the promise that it will become useful for non-investment purposes later on. Right now it's great at a deniable, hideable, non-inflatable, non-freezable, non-confiscatable, *teleportable* store of value, and is becoming great as a method of international remittance and payment in certain situations. Its currency uses are mostly niche so far, but that's to be expected for a young entrant.
Most of the value comes from it being Gold 2.0 right now, backed by the promise of being Money 2.0 and Paypal 2.0.

Nothing has "intrinsic" value, especially not because it costs money to make. This is a Marxist argument and Peter would rightly tear it to shreds. 
Bitcoin is a consensus ledger. Gold is a low-tech sneakernet way of achieving the same thing. The ledger system is valuable to adopt, so people adopt it. No need to discuss currency unit value versus gold ounce value. No need to get into "backing."

Actually the only reason governments tax so much is that they are ignorant of economics. If you really want to make big bucks as a govster, you lower taxes and wait for the economy to boom so you make more in the end.

The situation here is subtle. 
First I'd like to point out that a black/whitelisting scheme could easily be introduced even in a stateless world. Many different blacklists might be created by different communities and private law providers. Then there are two cases:
Case 1) The lists are counterproductive. They just end up disadvantaging everyone who adheres to them while doing relatively little to prevent crime. All merchants in that community or operating under that legal order would be obligated to refuse payment from certain people, hurting their businesses and sending economic growth elsewhere. Black/whitelists soon fall out of fashion.
Case 2) The lists are productive. Surprisingly, their effects on business are outweighed by the miraculous effect they have on crimes. All communities adopt their own blacklists because they make everyone better off.
Therefore, in a stateless world black/white/redlists are nothing to be afraid of. If they're harmful they won't catch on, and if they're helpful then there's no concern in the first place.
Of course, we do not yet live in a stateless world. The question in the world of today is merely one of strategy with regard to the coming clash between Bitcoin and governments. Will supporting such schemes give a useful illusion that Bitcoin can be controlled, obviating more draconian measures like bans? Or will supporting such schemes merely make it easier for regulators to have their way? Both will happen to some extent, but which effect will be more significant? 
The ideal situation is probably one where slow-moving regulators are distracted by various coin tracking schemes while Bitcoin seeps into every nook and cranny of the global economy, so that by the time such schemes come into force they are already guaranteed business-losers for any government that tries them.

This is an for a popular weekly news magazine/tabloid. In the magazine, there's one page about Bitcoin at the end of a special section on "how to protect Japan's assets in the face of its quadrillion~~trillion~~ yen debt." 
The tone was dubious but not overly skeptical. It mentioned the drug and crime angle quite a bit, but it also said you could think of it as kind of like gold because of its limited supply. It showed the one-year chart and mentioned the dramatic price rises (40x this year, 50,000x since MtGox launched) and volatility. They also said there were only 4000 MtGox users in Japan.
They mentioned how to sign up for MtGox and get verified, and that it takes a week. With the price increases mentioned and the very wide circulation of this magazine, it will probably drive a lot of signups.
Some interesting tidbits from a MtGox rep quoted in the article:
* There are 720,000 users registered on MtGox
* 400,000 are active users
* 20% of MtGox users are Chinese, up from 4% in April

Good old economic ignorance also consists mostly of a set of cognitive biases that are vestiges of our ancestors having lived in very small tribes. So does the unwillingness of people to question authority, with the important consequence that they fail to ever question the nature of money, despite its tremendous importance in their lives. 
Another huge one is failure to understand exponential growth, caused by a bias toward linear extrapolation. The human mind wasn't designed for investing in general. There are too many biases in that area to even list.
Also, people have a *ceteris parabus* bias where they tend to evaluate one change at a time without considering the knock-on effects those changes will have or enable, nor the effects and repercussions that multiple simultaneous changes will have.
There are hundreds of biases and conventional fallacies working against Bitcoin, so unfortunately most people won't get it until late in the game. But that also means dispelling myths and helping people overcome bias are some of the more powerful techniques in the arsenal.

I meant they'd just go to the back of the line, but in many cases that might be impractical/expensive. But expensive is just the point: poor people can make easy money. 
I see it as expanding the scope of the division of labor, basically increasing the number of useful trades we can make with each other. Right now we either have to get a job or trade things or odd jobs on ebay or craigslist in order to engage in mutually useful economic (catallactic) actions. But there is so much more we could be doing for each other, if only we could have reliable on-the-fly knowledge of what trades people were willing to make and were able to make the transactions instantly and without meeting face to face. 
The Internet allows us to communicate those value scales through bidding, and Bitcoin allows the transaction to happen frictionlessly. With those two roadblocks out of the way, the scope of trade could really explode, making everyone wealthier and better off.

I'm under the impression that silver manipulation is happening mostly through "paper silver" (ETFs). This kind of manipulation can be done with impunuty as long as people trust the paper stock market system.
The question of whether the same could be done with BTC depends on whether enough people could be convinced to trust paper derivatives of it. I'm sure a lot of transparency would be demanded, but some people would certainly trust such derivatives, enabling a degree of manipulation that maybe could become significant.

I think this temporary change toward more centralization is simply a blip caused by the advent of ASICs and all the startup bottlenecks there. I've never seen a convincing argument that there is some kind of "death spiral" toward ever greater centralization.

They'd have to also run an extensive PR campaign to get people primed to accept the changes, resulting in a hard fork with traditional bitcoiners in the minority. To succeed at this without having the corrupted majority fork fail would take real economic understanding, and this is where I'd be surprised if any government organization could pull it off. Also, anti-fragility says that if that organization (or a different one) tried this once and messed it up, even if only on a much smaller scale, it'd be way harder to succeed next time since people would catch on.

Yeah, exactly. They can't say they seized them just because they have the private keys; they have to be sure they have **the only copy** of the private keys, which is impossible for seized bitcoins since they weren't the ones that generated the keys to them. The only way to properly seize bitcoins is to transfer them to an address you control. 
What would be hilarious is if they were forbidden from doing so because that woud be considered "tampering with evidence," on the analogy of draining a bank account rather than freezing it. You can't "freeze" someone's Bitcoin account, since there's no way to know whether or not they still have a copy of the private key. They have to drain it to be sure.

Governments may be rapacious, but I don't think they're in the habit of demanding taxes that it may not even be possible to pay. If that Norwegian guy who bought 10,000 BTC for $27 were taxed on his *holdings* but he lost his private key or Bitcoin went to zero before he was able to sell, it'd be impossible to pay any taxes on them, simply because he wouldn't necessarily ever have the money. 
I don't know much about taxes, but I'm pretty sure they won't tax anything unless there was - at some point at least - actual money available to be taxed.

Exactly. Adoption rate was never growing double exponential, just plain old vanilla exponential. Price went double exponential. Extrapolating the trend had the price reaching $googolplex next week. Something had to give. So it corrected, and could correct all the way back to the basic exponential. That would be really painful as bitcoiners would be only as rich as they were a few weeks ago :((
@_date: 2013-03-09 15:08:58
As long as the exponential rise continues, the way it will work is this:
* There will always be a large group of people who bought in recently and haven't seen huge profits yet. Those people will generally not want to sell and will wonder why anyone ever sells BTC or purchases anything with it.
* There will also always be another large group of people who bought in a while ago and *are* seeing huge profits (~1000% for example). Their net worth may have have tripled, say from  $70,000 to $210,000, but this massive potential change in their standard of living is still sitting in experimental  internet tokens that could suddenly go to zero at any time. These people will often want to sell a good chunk of their gains, and of course buying directly is often more efficient. So there will be a constant stream of purchases in BTC by relatively earlier adopters.

If this were true, it would be amazing that supermarkets don't also try to screw you over, etc. The culprit in every country will be slightly different, but in all cases I think you'll find (if you look in depth at the seen and unseen) the free market is being hindered by the government.

This feels like a shallow way to interpret how things will play out. There will always be incentive for anyone who is conversant in Bitcoin to cut out the middleman to save on whatever fees Paypal puts up. Paypal will eke out some business for itself before the tidal wave comes to sweep it away entirely. Paypal will survive if and only if it manages to add some kind of value, which will only aid in Bitcoin's rise. 
But even supposing Paypal adds nothing useful, the mere fact that it accept Bitcoin would be HUGE for Bitcoin, the biggest thing ever to happen in the Bitcoin world. We have to remember that this is a nascent technology just barely on people's radars. This kind of exposure and legitimacy would be a gigantic boost at just the right time.

Japan is reluctant to adopt Western things until they're "officially approved" or they are all over the TV. It took them ages to get into facebook, for example, partly because they had mixi. It took them a while to get into smartphones because until then Japanese phones were the best, and there was inertia. Basically if it wasn't invented in Japan there will be 1-3 years of lag. There are a ton of homegrown payment systems and digital moneys, plus moving money around within Japan and paying for things online is very easy. Taxation is also remarkably relaxed. Plus there are few libertarians or habitually out-of-the-box thinkers (there are some but the percentage is low compared to, say, the US). Finally, inflation is probably coming but it hasn't hit yet. Prices haven't budged for a decade on most things.

Better yet, fully embrace Bitcoin by letting people pay their taxes in it. Doing so will immediately put in motion entrepreneurial and business efforts on creative ways to have taxes deducted from bitcoin salaries and even to have merchants track who is buying what more easily for tax purposes. Those who want anonymity will have to avoid such merchants, but this actually makes government's job much easier for reasons I will explain. It is a win for both pro- and anti-government crowd. 
How can that be? History shows one very interesting thing about crime and punishment: when penalties are large but unlikely, crime flourishes. When penalties are small but likely, crime disappears. The point is to make things consistent; then the government maximizes its revenue, crime is minimized, and the people aren't living in fear of government. Bitcoin does enable tax evasion. However, it also - unlike cash - has the potential to make *casual* tax evasion by the general public much harder, because every transaction is public. The net result is *more revenue*, less total evasion, and also less business-killing worry about possible horrific consequences.
Let me say that again: **You can lower penalties while increasing revenue.** And this doesn't only apply to tax evasion. Even something as simple as speeding tickets can be revolutionized with Bitcoin. Lower fees, higher income; fewer violations (because people *know* they will likely get caught and fined), less popular hatred for government (because the penalties no longer need to be extreme to compensate for difficulty in enforcement). 
Are you getting the picture? Bitcoin is a government's dream come true, even as it's an anarchist's dream come true. Incredibly greater efficiency benefits everyone, is profitable for everyone, and makes the world safer and happier and more predictable (less worrisome) for everyone. Show the world what Germany is made of!

**tl;dw**: A bitcoin (actually a private key) is a proof of claim to property within a public record system. Like the deed to a house, which proves ownership within a government-run record system that is generally stable and secure, the private key proves ownership within a record system run by a network that sprang up voluntarily in the free market, consisting not of one company but of many independent actors, that is also generally stable and secure. Just like a deed contains this claim information in a form that is difficult to forge, so does a Bitcoin private key. And just as a deed contains that information in a form that can be held in the hand, so do Cascasius physical bitcoins. 
What he doesn't answer is, "What property are the private keys a claim *to*?"
To answer this we have to go deeper into what an ownership claim really is. In a government legal system, an ownership claim is essentially something that forces anyone who wants to "play by the rules" of that legal regime to allow the claimant full control over the claimed property. If I have an ownership claim to a house in the legal system in the US, the government and citizens will avoid interfering with my occupying or otherwise using that house as I see fit (within legal limits) **if** they wish to remain in adherence to that legal system. Government officials will generally try to adhere to the rules because failing to do so damages their credibility and weakens the social structure of their tax base; private citizens will generally do this because they want to be good citizens and not get arrested or sued.
However, an ownership claim isn't the only type of claim. Breaking down the concept of a claim yet further, we find that a claim is more generally something that "forces" (pardon the phrasing, voluntarists) participants in a given social order to allow the claimant to *do a certain thing*, if the participants wish to play by the rules of that social order. They want to do this because doing so allows them to enjoy the benefits of that social order.
Bitcoin - the system - is a kind of social order. It may not feel very social, because it is pseudonymous and built out of protocol instead of customary law and legislation, but it is a social order nonetheless. Like a government-based social order of government officials and citizens bound virtually by a set of rules (legal system) insofar as they wish to participate, the participants in the Bitcoin system agree to recognize "sent bitcoins" (claims in the Bitcoin system signed using private keys) as tender for goods and services they are offering. Although government is compulsory and Bitcoin is voluntary, we can say that those who don't play by the rules in the government-law-based social order risk losing out (on certain benefits and legal protections), and those who don't play by the rules in the Bitcoin social order (those who don't recognize bitcoins tendered via the Bitcoin protocol) risk losing out on the goods and services available through the Bitcoin ecosystem, including missing out on the speed, efficiency, and cost savings the system offers.
Essentially, then, bitcoins are claims to goods and services for sale in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

1) Bitcoin is not mainly useful as a currency. Currency and payments combined constitute maybe only a tenth as much as its wealth preservation function. So no, this China news is ho-hum. Certainly not "very bad." Those who continue to misunderstand what Bitcoin is and why it's revolutionary will continue to lose money (unless they just take a leap of faith and hold, but that's not likely to be a sustainable position...everyone eventually freaks out).
 
2) The market was overheated. It had been doubling every ten days. How long can you expect that to continue? It was way above its historical exponential growth trendline and veterans were looking for a correction. 
3) Weekend dip.
4) Typical panic overshoot. Though it could go even lower. Just a way for bulls to rake in even more money, unfortunately from weak hands who don't understand what is happening or how to contexualize it.

This image been posted many times, but what people usually fail to grasp is that although the chart applies very well to a specific pool of potential investors, with Bitcoin that pool is not static but instead constantly expanding. In fact it is expanding at an exponential rate!
What we actually find is a cascading series of hype cycles reaching ever wider (exponentially widening) circles. This means a boatload of volatility, and the longer the price runs up without a drop, the harder it will fall when it does drop. However, all this remains within the context of a net effect - long term - of steady exponential growth.

And of course people will sell as the price rises. If the rice rises a lot, people will sell a lot. That's just sane portfolio management. If you put in half your spare assets, $5000, and a few months later it's worth $50,000, BTC now comprises more than 90% of your portfolio. It'd be insane not to sell some, but of course just some - not all (why the heck does it have to be all or nothing?). In fact if people didn't do this there'd be the complaint that early adopters are hoarding their coins and won't spread the wealth. Using Bitcoin as a store of value or off-shore account isn't just not a bad thing, it is *at least* as legitimate and beneficial as using it as a medium of exchange.  
As a side note, 560,000 BTC volume doesn't mean 1/20 of all BTC were sold that day. It's the sum total of all buys and sells that day, and there were of course plenty of buys as well because there was plenty of volatility.

Bizarre argument. Why couldn't the private sector do that, supposing it were allowed to? What has any government ever done more efficiently than the private sector??

It would have been a colossal waste of money from most people's perspective, perhaps damaging the economy severely and sending many people into poverty. Worth it? Worth the cost in 1969? How can we know? Oh yeah, there's this thing called the market that incentivises people to do expensive things if enough people want them done badly enough. 
The fact that a private company did not send a man to the moon before NASA is only because not enough people really cared badly enough (again, why not in 1950? No market signal to tell if it was a waste of resources in 1969 or not), the skilled people were being braindrained from the private sector into working at NASA, and/or various regulations made it difficult or impossible to perform, fund, or control liability.

Perhaps it should just be stated from the start that **all coins leave your address every time you send coins from it**. Either they are *all* sent to one different address, or they are *all* sent to two different addresses that they are divided between. The only way to send "some" of the coins held in a given address you have the private key to is simultaneously to send the rest to a totally different address (and you better be very sure you have the private key to that one, too!).
ETA: I often hear that it's "recommended" to use a new address for each transaction. Never knew it was mandatory and automatic.

No, that's exactly his point and he's entirely correct. If you don't understand why stuffing money into a mattress is the *exact same* as a loan to all other holders of that money in proportion to how much they hold, you haven't really understood the basics of money. Money's value is proportional to its scarcity at any given time. Stuff 1% of the total money supply into a mattress and for that time period the money is 1% scarcer, making everyone else's money command 1% greater purchasing power for as long as that money remains in the mattress. If someone has $1000 and you hoard 1% of the dollars today, that person now has $1010 in purchasing power (in yesterday's dollars) for as long as that money is socked away. You've loaned him $10, or 1%, along with every other holder. The only difference is you get to recall the loan at any time.
Think if this were not the case: you hoard 1% but everyone else's money gains no purchasing power. That would be awfully strange since there're still the same resources available in the economy. The supply of eggs, wood, ink cartridges, masseuse labor hours, etc. in the economy didn't suddenly fall by 1%, but suddenly people can't buy as much with their money...just because you hoarded 1% of the money supply. Absurd on its face, ignores scarcity, basic fallacy.

As with all market speculation, it's hard to say what entrepreneurs will come up with, but it won't be monopolistic as it is now.

How is it quantified whether you made money or not (how *can* it be)? It seems there'd have to be some delineation between, perhaps, consumption goods and commodities or something. 
You can say you made money if you buy fiat money with BTC, and perhaps if you buy a car or a dinner with BTC where the fiat price is known (but this is less clear because sometimes there is no fiat price), but for another illiquid commodity with divergent prices on different exchanges like litecoin it's hard to say whether you made or lost money in the transaction.

If the yacht seller just reinvests the money, the yacht seller never gets to enjoy the wealth (unless the new investment pays off, but that's a separate matter of having good investment skill). You can certainly maintain your purchasing power if you put all your coins in cold storage and never consume anything, but that has the same economic effect as destroying the private key: it is a donation to every other person in the economy. The moment you spend on a consumption good/service, you start the distribution process. 
In no case can a person who is merely coin-rich and has no other wealth-preserving skills simultaneously live it up while retaining his or her purchasing power. Unless you have such skill or use your wealth to buy influence with those in power, either you get to enjoy the fruits of your wealth and redistribute it, or you sock it away forever and it's a donation to everyone else making their coins worth more.

It's not enough simply not to invest what you can't afford to lose, because when the price skyrockets people inevitably start to imagine they have those unrealized gains. 
They look at the $2000 they invested, which was just about all they could afford to lose, and now see $50,000 in value. They begin to imagine that they have $50,000 in the bank, maybe a nice new car in the driveway, or that they could quit their current job, even though they know they don't want to actually convert the coins to fiat money and miss out on even greater gains.
How do you capitalize on the potential gains without putting life-changing amounts of money (unrealized gains) at risk along the way? The answer is to sell off a certain small preset amount for each time the price doubles. Depending on your risk tolerance, selling 10-20% at each doubling (once the amounts become life-changing) will accomplish this.
This maintains a very aggressive portfolio of around 80% bitcoin and 20% fiat money during bull runs and will ensure you get wealthy if Bitcoin goes mainstream, and that you'll still do quite well if a catastrophe happens along the way. Most importantly, you'll be able to keep a cool head during crashes and you probably won't panic sell.

Hard fork annulling old private keys? No, extremely unlikely until maybe quantum computers require a new type of private key. I think you'd have plenty of advance notice.
The other risks are that bitaddress.org could be malicious or hacked (produces non-random addresses, for example), and of course that there could be some way for someone to see the private key you generated (or place limits on what private key is generated before you generate it).
I'd recommend crosschecking with another address generator like brainwallet.org, electrum, or Armory (or several). Also do it one a computer that's never been online if possible, so nothing could have been on it limiting the possibility space of private keys generated.

Might this be an opportunity to create a tiered system? Like
* High fee: Very fast
* Standard fee: ~10 min per confirmation
* Tiny fee: Slow, could take several hours
There are situations where speed is of the essence and people are willing to pay more, even much more, for guarantee speedy transactions. This could even be a substantial income source for miners.
**No, wait. This is better:**
If client GUI's displayed an estimate of transaction time based on fee gathered from current network data, fees could be dynamic, with people always paying the market price the speed they need, and miners making substantial income off priority processing fees. 
In fact, now that I think about it, it seems obvious this is how it should be. Not having price information available for users simply hurts users and miners by depriving them of the knowledge they need to maximize the mutually beneficial nature of their trades.
By providing price information based on the current state of the network and bidding, clients would perform a valuable service and vastly increase the total value of the network. In the meantime a website that did this would a second-best alternative.

If only there were a way to use Suica-type RFID smartcards to transfer bitcoins, as they're getting very ubiquitous. I imagine that the mechanism is too simple to perform the necessary transaction-signing calculations, but a centralized solution could work for that (MtGox/Bitpay/Coinbase/blockchain.info/Bitinstant issue their own card or partner with Suica or Pasmo to issue a Bitcoin-branded card that can be loaded with cash at any railway station but with balance maintained in BTC, so that your card is holding more and more value if the price rises). You can use them at almost every station in major cities, almost every convenience store, many kiosks, and a large and growing number of vending machines.

If you could make an API so that clients could incorporate the stats directly into their UIs, then each client could automatically adjust them for the coin age of each specific user's coins. All the user would see is, for any transaction they are about to make, how large of a fee they will likely have to include to get it processed within a given time frame.

Unemployment caused by regulations and other friction in the marketplace is bad.
Unemployment caused by no one having any needs that they need fulfilled is...the very definition of paradise. If robots ended up doing everything for us, food, clothing and shelter would be so abundant that everyone would have them without lifting a finger (of course many people would exercise and perform "work"  just to stay healthy).

Not true. If there were some real advantage we'd be trying to get it incorporated into Bitcoin.
The view of Bitcoin as a "cryptocurrency" is what leads to this kind of confusion. Bitcoin is a ledger; there isn't all that much use for more than one ledger. There's a little use for having a backup ledger to test things out on and maybe as a bit of a hedge and for the anonymity it can help provide by switching between the ledgers. Also, due to frictions in the fiat world, the altcoins may present some arbitrage opportunities on the BTC price if they were traded on the major exchanges. 
But after the first backup ledger, the utility of a second and third one drops off very quickly. This doesn't lead to endless inflation, but more like a maximum of 20-30% total. Not per year, but total, for all time. The market cap fluctuates more than that in a week. In other words, the inflation aspect is negligible.

The market is stepping up its moderation game by causing the price chasers to lose their shirts. And simply complaining about it and arguing prominently against it is quite effective. It just has to be done over again every few months due to the eternal Spetember effect. 
Direct moderation is the last resort of last resorts because it has a chilling effect. Worse, the effect is unseen. For example, how many of us would have seen the altcoin pumping that turned out to be an important bubble top indicator if there had been a stronger ban on altcoin-related posts? It wasn't excessive, but it had its moment in the sun and was annoying for a day or two, but turned out to be important.

The actual effect will be opposite; if governments see Bitcoin as a moneymaker because it opens up new revenue streams (imagine automatic speed ticketing where you just get an email and it's literally two clicks to pay it) and reduces administrative overhead, there could be too many fifedoms within the state apparatus that are interested in Bitcoin's benefits for a real attack to materialize.

You can send to two addresses at once, in the same transaction. So if you have 10 BTC in your paper address and want to spend just 2 BTC, make a transaction where you send 2 BTC to the recipient and 8 BTC to another address you created in advance (could be another paper wallet).

Hundreds and sometimes thousands, I think. But my impression is that checksums and such would make any errors in the OCR simply result in the transaction not processing. This is certainly true for when you mistake a few characters in an address you're sending to (it won't just send to some other random address), so I don't see how it coud end badly. I *think* you'd just have to redo it, or in the worst case check it over with your own eyes until you spot the error. I've heard the latest OCR software is pretty damn good, though, and reading perfect text directly off a screen seems like it woud be the easiest of OCR tasks.

The other reason people think Bitcoin will be banned is due to the ultimate long-term threat to the government's existence, or at least the end of the era of central bankers. The central bankers are aware of Bitcoin and the fact that it threatens central bank control (as recognized by both the ECB and the Fed in their reports...in fact a 1997 Fed paper recognized that a public ledger system like Bitcoin could end central banking over a decade before Bitcoin was even conceived). What they will do is the big question.

No one needs to "do their part." Simply having information about fee levels in the market at everyone's fingertips will create the appropriate incentives. Then it's just a question of fees vs. overcentralization. We can have low fees and risk becoming somewhat less decentralized (I think not enough to matter*), or higher fees and stay just as decentralized as we are, but unable to do more than 7tps on the blockchain.
*keep in mind that the amount of decentralization we have is somewhat arbitrary; it's a given that a strong degree of decentralization must be maintained, but if the argument is that decentralization is to be maximized at all costs, why not make the blocksize smaller than it already is? Of course anyone can rationalize the current blocksize after the fact, but Satoshi intended it as temporary so unless he just got really lucky and accidentally picked the perfect blocksize to strike a balance between decentralization and network capacity, the hardline argument against any increases is empty and arbitrary.

Yeah it's not a currency yet, but that's not worrying from either an investment or a technology perspective. Bitcoin can succeed as a platform, go several orders of magnitude higher in price, and restructure the entire world without ever being used directly as a currency. 
Everyone paying for groceries with bitcoins isn't revolutionary. Everyone using Bitcoin to bypass the traditional banking and payment system is somewhat revolutionary. Everyone storing their wealth untouchably in Bitcoin is massively revolutionary. 
Being able to buy groceries with bitcoins directly, denominated in bitcoins, will merely be a sign that we've arrived.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:37:22
Might be a good idea (thinking of China), but there's another important difference: a national currency is intended to be used universally within its territory, whereas Bitcoin is non-territorial. While the new national currency has no more-established competitor, the bitcoin* is always co-mingling with other currencies that may be much more established and enjoy legal tender status. 
But the larger point, and we probably agree on this, is that it isn't yet very proper to even call Bitcoin a currency. For one thing it does have *currency* in that few people accept it (especially few in a given geographical area), and it is volatile (mitigated by Bitpay-like services, but still). It's a store of value with some revolutionary Star Trek level properties, and that's where the valuation mostly comes from right now, as well as future promise to become a currency later on.

The interesting thing about Bitcoin compared to other technologies is that it is not only a technology, but also a valuable asset. We see abnormalities that make people think we are farther along the curve than we are, because adoption is not driven only by the use value of the technology (frictionless global payments) but also by investment/speculation.
No actually, let me start again.
The interesting thing about Bitcoin compared to other technologies is that it is *not just one revolutionary technological innovation, but several inextricably linked together as one*. We see abnormalities because there are at least *three major technologies being adopted all at once*, though some are more immediately functional than others.
Leading the pack, perhaps solidly in the Early Adopters section, we have "Bitcoin as Gold 2.0." Teleportable, hideable, deniable, not capital controllable, non-inflatable, non-forgeable. Simply put, people are seeing the value of Bitcoin as an investment, based partly on these stunningly advantageous characteristics and partly on the future promise of the other technological innovations contained within it, which are farther behind on the curve.
In the beginning of the Early Adopters section or late in the Innovators section, we have "Bitcoin as remittance system." Virtually cost-free, unhampered, anonymizable, trustless, irrevocable.
Solidly in the Innovators section, we have "Bitcoin as currency." All the advantages of the above, but without the necessary ubiquity (merchant adoption, etc.) to be useful enough to compel many people to obtain bitcoins solely for this purpose. The roaders count as innovators, going through the trouble to obtain bitcoins solely to enable purchases, but only because of their arguably niche needs.
Lastly there are the new technologies like colored coins, Mastercoin, smart contracts, and other applications of programmable ledger systems that are still on the horizon and not yet used for anything substantial to my knowledge.
The investor (as opposed, perhaps, to the speculator or "price chaser") takes into account the present value *and* future promise of all these technologies at their various points on the adoption curve, and is rewarded financially for understanding the potential before others.

If it's British customary law, on which US law is based, then I assume things like that won't be banned. The laws against things like that are usually not laws but statutes, or legislated law. Customary law is created through a decentralized emergent "market" process, and is probably what law will look more like in a Bitcoin-powered world.

Note that whatever is true about BTC as a currency, as long as it has *some* value there, it can function extremely effectively as a store of value. That alone would justify much higher prices, even if it never caught on as a medium of exchange.
Now go back and note that if it did catch on as a store of value, the price would stabilize and become quite suitable as a currency even supposing it wasn't before.

MisterBigg was Ripple's harshest critic, a total thorn in OpenCoin's side, lambasting OC very effectively and loudly on the altcoin forum at Bitcointalk. Then one day, on a dime, he totally reversed his position and started arguing Ripple was better than Bitcoin. OpenCoin reportedly paid off Ripple's original creator to stay out of the project and never again use the Ripple name. I wouldn't put it past them to pay people to keep quiet or shill for them. Much of the debate has that vibe about it.

Ignorant of what? Your Keynesian education?
These ideas are dismissed with a moment's thought. For example, Bitcoin is only massively deflationary while it's the underdog, and during that time everything will be denominated in fiat. As soon as it takes over and everything is denominated in BTC, it will only be as deflationary as economic expansion is large. In neither case would merchants have to be updating their prices any more often than they do now.

I spoke to well-connected Japanese professional the other day about Bitcoin. It stretched to several hours because he was endlessly interested. Since I had mentioned it previously, he had done some research in the meantime and understood the significance. 
Many Japanese like gold because they don't really trust the Bank of Japan or the whims of politicians in general. Most are not anti-government, but they do tend to think politicians are flaky. There is also, believe it or not, quite a strong thread of banking conspiracy theorists. I've had the subject brought up with me several times in the wild, though never the subject of Bitcoin.
I think the problem as far as Japan is that Bitcoin has been marketed as a payment system, but Japan would be more interested in it for its gold-like properties. This is also why this Japanese guy was interested.
There is a tremendous bandwagon effect in Japan, so the very most button-pushing way you could probably pitch Bitcoin to most Japanese people is, "Secure your place on the golden ledger in the sky." In other words, frame it as a landgrab, because that's what it is. More than the American dream of being wealthy and independent, in Japan there is a stronger feeling of not wanting to be left behind.

The best way to buy in large is through dark channels, i.e., find some other whale who wants to sell, or buy into a huge wall on an exchange. Anything to avoid price slippage - though a million isn't really that big a buy these days. As to where to find a large seller, user rpietila on Bitcointalk apparently has a whale network for dark liquidity. Still, again, this amount is not that large, so Bitstamp, etc. should be an option. Start with a smaller amount of course, just to check.

Here's my attempt at setting your concerns to rest. 
First of all, note that no altcoin - no matter how superior - can become competitive with Bitcoin overnight.  
Let's suppose "Supercoin" comes onto the scene and blows Bitcoin away in every aspect feature-wise. It still cannot be trusted until it has a track record, and that inevitably takes *time.* During that time, there will be plenty of opportunity for bitcoin holders to diversify into it as it proves itself. Sure, it's a problem for Bitcoin itself, but it is not a problem for bitcoin holders.
Even if Litecoin were to be deemed decisively superior by the majority, it also has the track record problem, and there is still plenty of time for bitcoiners to get into it. Again no problem.
Of course, a catastrophic glitch in Bitcoin would likely push one or more altcoins into the forefront, so it's worth holding a few as a hedge even now, but again this is an example of altcoins conferring an advantage to Bitcoin users, not a disadvantage. Without any backup coin, the value of everyone's cryptocurrency portfolio is always in danger of going to zero.
Moreover, having at least one significantly valued altcoin actually increases value not only for bitcoin holders but even for the Bitcoin system itself: 
* Passing Bitcoin assets through an altcoin and back again is the ultimate form of tumbling, adding substantially to Bitcoin's privacy features. (However, additional altcoins confer less and less value here.)
* An altcoin allows for something like "shorting" BTC when the price runs up too fast. Especially since trades can be made without going through fiat (without even going through a central exchange, once a p2p altcoin exchange is set up), day traders can perform their role of smoothing out volatility by temporarily shifting some BTC into LTC, for example, much as PM traders trade gold for silver when it looks like gold has rallied too far. This is both helpful for keeping BTC prices rational + smooth *and* ensures that at least one altcoin will maintain some value. (However, additional altcoins confer less and less value here.)
* Finally, an altcoin functions as testnet to help anticipate problems in Bitcoin before they occur. The closer the altcoin is to Bitcoin, the more helpful for that. Conversely, the more dissimilar the altcoin is to Bitcoin, the greater chance of finding a "must-add" feature that may be able to be incorporated into Bitcoin anyway. (Here again, additional altcoins confer less and less value.)
As for inflation due to altcoins gaining market share, it is extremely limited because each new altcoin confers less and less value. Even if somehow four or five altcoins were to take on some significant valuation, it seems reasonable that the first (say Litecoin) couldn't exceed maybe 20% of Bitcoin's market cap, simply because the above value aspects wouldn't ever justify more than that. And a second altcoin might max out at 20% of that (4% that of BTC), and so one. That is a tiny amount of inflation in the grand scheme of things, and is probably way too generous of an estimate. In fact, most of the inflation due to altcoins has probably *already happened.*
One more thing to keep in mind on why cryptocurrencies may "compete" but holders don't need to pick favorites or worry about it: Once altcoin exchange infrastructure matures, browser plugins or similar will likely make it so that users can buy from any merchant that accepts Bitcoin, no matter what kind of coins they hold, with prices even being displayed in the altcoin of their choice and the merchant being none the wiser. Their altcoins will automatically get exchanged for bitcoins in the p2p market as they make the purchase. This is why Atlantis is unnecessary and the whole way most people seem to think about Litecoin is flawed. The most liquid coin will be the standard, yet exchange among them being frictionless will make this sort of irrelevant to the end user, other than as a consideration on how to weight their asset portfolio.
TL;DR: Fear not the altcoins. They are our friends and can only help the cryptocurrency ecosystem that benefits us all. They are not "competition," but hedging, tumbling, testnet, and backup systems that add value to Bitcoin and/or to bitcoin holders. Most business will always be conducted in Bitcoin as the most liquid and stable coin, except if Bitcoin ever fails in that regard, in which case having altcoins around is again a blessing, not a curse. Because of the limited and rapidly decreasing benefit of additional altcoins for these aspects, there is also no concern of substantial inflation due to a proliferation of altcoins.
EDIT: In case the point re: Litecoin got lost in the length, it's that even a (one!) very similar fork of Bitcoin with minor changes confers several benefits for the cryptocurrency ecosystem just by being a separate fork, not necessarily owing to any substantial advantages it has.

You seem to be holding two contradictory premises in your mind at once.
It might be stupid to buy in or stupid to cash out, but it can't possibly be both. 
If spending coins you have is foolish, it can only be because there is likely more upside. If the only people to win were early adopters, that implies there's no more upside, which means spending them makes perfect sense.

The flipside is that you took out a $10,000 loan because you didn't have 10k to spare, and now you have $100,000 worth of value to work with even though it might be much higher than your credit limit. You couldn't have that much money even if you had put all your spare cash into BTC. "Deflation is awesome for debtors!"
What the debtor loses in magnified possible repayment shortfall, he or she gains in magnified stake in an appreciating asset.
Not to mention that this is all moot because if that tradeoff is not to the borrower's liking, they can just have the repayment terms be pegged to dollars, etc. (Borrow 1,000 BTC, pay back 120 BTC if the price rises 10x.)

To your first point: It seems right now the optimal use is as a long-term investment, which is what people typically mean by store of value in Bitcoin's case (hint: no one who's not insane thinks Bitcoin is a *stable* store of value). Medium of exchange will happen later.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:07:39
Again it depends on what risks you're up against and how those compare with however likely you think Bitcoin going to zero is. When you take into account the upside if it doesn't go to zero (the binary bet), if you don't mind volatility it can be a great store of value. It's not a universally great store of value, of course. That would be gold, or silver. But for many people in certain circumstances it is.

At this time, Bitcoin's value is not primarily based on its currency/transactional usage, but on its function as a store of value. The comparison should be to something like gold, and many of the investors are high net worth individuals, unlike the average person in Costa Rica. Although the number of people using bitcoins daily is a fairly small percentage, I'd guess there are nearly a million people holding bitcoins as a store of value.

Indeed. The problem isn't fractional reserve per se, it's that banks have the privilege to mess with reserves because they are politically very well-connected. Banks in a free market would still likely have a degree of fractional reserve going on, at least if they stored gold. 
Whether this argument has swayed anyone or not, it is largely a moot issue for Bitcoin, since once wallet security is foolproof for anyone, banks as we know them will be obsolete.

Bitcoin isn't user-friendly enough for easy mainstream consumption yet (which is also why most of the money is yet to be made), so don't expect to understand it quickly. It takes a few weeks of reading and thinking (and if you like, discussion) to get up to speed any way you slice it. The first thing you should try to figure out is what exactly Bitcoin is. It's a protocol, a distributed consensus system for maintaining a public ledger. Keep researching from the links provided (or others) and if you have more questions let us know!

1) Download a copy of both bitaddress.org and brainwallet.org
2) Send/transfer the two files to a *permanently* offline device
3) Input a long string of random words into both using the "brainwallet" function
4) Check that they produce identical results (public and private keys)
5) Write down the public and private keys, carefully
6) Optional: Physically destroy the device
The only way I can see this possibly failing is if both bitaddress and brainwallet were compromised, and by the very same person or colluding parties (this can be guarded against by choosing other generators, including the one included in Linux itself). Or if your random words were not truly random enough or you wrote them down wrong.

Tipping isn't where it's at. Here's where I think it's at:
You have an app that simply informs drivers that by changing to the right lane (etc.) within the next 5 seconds they'll receive $0.04. After an hour on the road they might have saved up enough for an extra taco at the drive thru. 
So there are buyers and sellers of "road favors." They could even be the same people (or even AIs). Of course they don't perceive it as buying and selling; their navigation display just shows little dollar signs to be picked up by changing lanes - like a video game.  
On the "buy" side, you could touch (or maybe just look) where you want to go, and whoever is in your way would - if they have the app - see that they could move for you and get a bit of money. You could bid higher if the stakes are higher for you or if you're wealthier. 
This isn't just for cars either. It's potentially *a whole new form of communication and coordinative resource allocation* that wasn't possible before. Just imagine offering people money to get out of line in front of you when you're lining up to buy a last-minute present for an important date, or for a concert you're about to miss the first 30 minutes of standing in line. It would be socially faux pas to do it with cash and face-to-face, but with such an app they wouldn't even necessarily know who was offering. (GPS could check that they moved, they could simply take a reputation hit in the system if they accepted the cents and didn't move.)
The possibilities are endless, especially with things like Google Glass and driverless vehicles. The bottom line is that every action we take that excludes other's ability to do the same (such as getting into the fourth position in a line) is valued differently by each person taking it. Until now there's been no easy way to coordinate so that the person who values that exclusionary action (occupying a certain lane, etc.) more highly can bid to increase the odds they can be the one to take that action.
The end result is simply a more efficient, more satisfying world. You're late for work and you pay people to get out of your way, you automatically advertise to any taxis that you're willing to pay a premium, maybe you even pay a store in advance to stay open a minute longer so you can pick up something you urgently need. Maybe you have a perfect bench scoped out for your magical date spot but some dude is sitting there doing his mail. You pay him to buzz off because this is make or break. It's beautiful. 
Anything at any price, but usually very tiny. Total coordination of not just all economic activities, but all rivalrous/exclusionary actions. Made possible by Bitcoin and other new technologies.

Correlation is not causation. It is in fact opposite: The countries with the most productive populaces can *afford* to tax them more without breaking the back of the economy.
And the industrial revolution was indeed a picnic for the poor *compared to before that* (this is verified by both the far more squalid pre-industrial conditions and the common sense observation that poor people voluntarily chose to work in factories versus engage in subsistence farming or whatever they did before).

No. It's the expertise of the wealthy and their connectedness with existing power structures that enable them to *stay* wealthy.

More risks:
* Rather than pre-generating the addresses, a scamming paper wallet generator could subtly introduce certain constraints on how "random" the address generation process really is. Most clever would be to limit the randomness in such a way that the scammer could only practically ever figure out say 1 in 1000 addresses that are generated. Then it'd just be a matter of doing some hunting and collecting the swag slowly over time so that few would suspect the generator.
* The same "constrained randomness" could simply occur by accident, then later when either the original creator or someone else figures this out, they go hunting. Especially if some random seed generation method were found to be insecure at a later date.
* Typos or errors in output. The checksum prevents errors like displaying one character incorrectly, but not errors like showing the wrong private key for the address. 
* Most devious would be to create a legit generator that has little "glitches" that appear occasionally, when the user is doing something "they aren't supposed to do," so that newbies will occasionally get waylayed into generating insecure addresses and perhaps the code reviewers would not see the trap.
Usual solution:
* Don't use any generators (or versions of those generators) that haven't been reviewed by the community. Cryptographicaly verify the code is authentic to guard against man-in-the-middle attacks when you download it. However, this doesn't guard against obscure glitches. Or heaven forbid, the long con.
My (foolproof?) solution:
1) Get two or more trusted paper wallet generators on your secure, never online computer (or unused smartphone). Example: bitaddress.org and brainwallet.org
2) Using the "brainwallet" function, input an insanely long string of random keyboard mashing. 
3) Copy that same string into both generators and check that the resulting public and private keys are the same between the two generators
4) As a final check, try changing a few characters in the string and see that the resulting keys change but continue to match between the two generators
5) Use the final resulting address and private key (only one; for a second address, perform the keyboard mashing extravaganza again from scratch)
I hear there's also a way to do this on the command line in Linux as well, so that would be yet another check. 
The only way I can see this failing is if somehow the two generators were under the control of the same person or group. At this stage it seems extremely unlikely that, say, the creators of Ubuntu would be in on it as well, though, so this Bitaddress.org+Brainwallet.org+Linux seems like a sufficient level of paranoia for anyone. 
I also realize some people might mash the keyboard in an insufficiently random way, but if it's long enough and you make sure to try changing characters near the beginning and end of the string to check that the generators aren't clipping off part of it, it seems to me foolproof even for the layperson.
EDIT: In case the reasoning behind any of the steps in this method weren't clear, the challenge is to 1) Be absolutely certain that you generated a completely new, truly random seed that no one else could ever possibly know, 2) Be absolutely certain that there is a direct, one-to-one correspondence between the random seed and the keys generated, 3) Be able to do this with no specialized knowledge.

People will soon learn that a coin is only as good as its devs, network, ecosystem, and any interesting alternative functionality it may offer. 
At this stage many coins are popping up and getting speculative attention as Bitcoin's growth has calmed down and people are looking for the next roller coaster ride to profit from. When Bitcoin (and/or an actually useful altcoin) starts ascending rapidly again, that rising tide of capital will ebb away from most of the copycat coins and leave most altcoin investors high and dry. The burn from that pullback will likely induce a dry spell in altcoin growth.

You think correctly. Most economists *would* sharply disagree because their funding comes from the establishment, which has a vested interest in maintaining inflationary policy.
You've simply segued from "Bitcoin needs users not just speculators" to "volatility is bad" and finally to "deflation is bad." These are three separate arguments that each require backing. One does not simply follow from the others. More users would probably be better and volatility is probably worse than stability, but to call deflation bad just because government-funded economists say so is an argument from authority.
@_date: 2013-10-03 18:05:47
That 9M figure is *highly* misleading. In fact without more details it tells us nothing conclusive. The same group of people trading around a million BTC mostly among themselves for 2.5 years could easily lead to a total transaction amount of 9M. The more furiously they were trading with each other the fewer bitcoins would need to have been in use for SR purposes at any given time to lead to the alleged 9M total. As a contrived example, trading around the same 1000 BTC among the same people 10 times per day for 2.5 years (~900 days) would lead to something in that ballpark. To the extent that many roaders were buying coins solely to facilitate purchases, they'd be trying to keep as few coins on hand as possible at any given time. 
The total users times their average number of BTC on hand on at a time is the figure that should be of interest. (Even money velocity is not so interesting for the wider economy if it is mostly insular exchange among that group.)

This kind of static extrapolation distorts the medium-term picture to a degree.
I think we can all agree you'd be crazy not to sell at least a bit of coin if your initial investment increased 20x and your unrealized gains had raised you several wealth classes. And since selling incurs big capital gains tax and other expense and inconvenience, if you also happen want a new iPad (you just got relatively rich, why not treat yourself?), you'd do far better just ordering it through bitcoinstore, Bitcoinin, or even BitSpend. Any fees are far outweighed by the savings and convenience of not having to "cash out." And these options for spending are increasing rapidly, as is the wealth effect that prompts longer-term holders to skim profits off the top - especially since Bitcoin is far from a surefire success.

More importantly, early adopters have no power to control the issuance of money like most of the world's current power elite, meaning that they have no power to keep wealth centralized.

Money is *a* measure of useful output, but not the only one. 
People don't always earn what they're worth to society, but that's nowhere near an argument that money is a bad thing. Money is what enables the division of labor, without which few of us would even have been born. The thing to look forward to is not having to work (or not very much) because of technology making things more efficient. Then you'll have plenty of money and not have to worry about it, unless you spend like crazy.

Depends on whether you think giant governments are a good thing. One could argue the current system of centralized control is exactly what is keeping children unable to think for themselves, technology (including medical tech) crippled by patents and other forms of regulatory capture, and medical services bid up to insane prices by government subsidies, arbitrary licensing requirements that severely limit the pool of doctors, and "hazard pay" for the risk doctors take on due to the subversion of common/tort law by legislation enabling the current tide of over-litigiousness.

But I mean, you couldn't possibly have to pay capital gains tax (15% or 40%) on each swap between altcoins, because after just a few you'd owe more than 100% of what you made. Maybe it's that when you sell BTC for LTC, you pay the tax on the BTC gain at the market price...but no, because then if LTC collapsed you wouldn't have any money for the IRS to take. 
So the only way a capital gains tax asset-to-asset swapping seems it could work is if you were simply taxed on the difference between the price you paid in dollars for the first coin you bought and the price you received in dollars (or in non-assets, like consumables) for whatever type of coin you sold. Like if you bought 1 BTC for $100, traded it for 100 LTC, then traded the 100 LTC back for 2 BTC and sold the 2 BTC for $1000, the taxable event would be the final trade only, and you would own tax rate x $900 (the actual realized gain, the only thing you're guaranteed to be able to pay from). Any other way and you end up potentially having the IRS demand tax money that you can't possibly pay.

I'd create a new address crosschecked with other such services (all offline of course), then send your funds there. You can sort of guard against de-randomization attacks by creating a brainwallet with a crazy long and insanely random passphrase that you *don't* try to remember. The point is to check that all the services give you the same private key from that brainwallet. Then it seems, barring collusion among all of them (or some virus in your offline machine), you can be sure the private key really is generated from that crazy passphrase, so it is untouchable.

It should be expected to at least touch its pre-Cyprus price, since most new money was just chasing that mini-bubble. In other words it could bounce off $50 (or even $30), then return to it's pre-Cyprus trendline at $70. That trendline has the price reaching $100 again in two weeks, $200 in early June, $1,000 by autumn, and $10,000 by Christmas - so it's hardly bearish. Just have a bit of patience. It shouldn't be a surprise that a media-hype-fueled bubble will pop, but it was already experiencing steady exponential growth before that, and not one single fundamental reason for the discontinuation of that growth has appeared.

Price slippage prevents this. 
If a government tried to buy all the coins on offer at MtGox right now, they'd pay the current price for the first few coins, but as they were buying the price they'd have to pay per coin would soar. Moreover, as soon as it was clear there was such a ravenous, determined buyer willing to buy at any price, people would raise their asking prices skyward until they reached a level where even a determined government would get tapped out. At the extreme, many people would simply never sell the majority of their holdings, because they would believe the price would continue rising, even at 1BTC = $1 million.

Yeah Jeff flubbed that one, but he must have known. Maybe misspoke or got confused, since obviously the state would soon just ban all cryptocurrencies if people simply switched to Litecoins or whatever.
I see at least four better answers:
1. States might get addicted to the extra revenue and savings Bitcoin offers, as they have with the Internet, and the CIA and NSA may be backing it for their own reasons behind the scenes. Certain political interests may make it difficult to ban. It may also simply grow too big before sufficient quelling action is taken.
2. Bitcoin would go underground, as parts of it already are. The price would probably take a large hit, resuming exponential growth but from a lower starting point. Even if it "just" becomes an illicit way for billionaires to offshore their accounts, the mafia to launder money, and an ever-expanding SR, it will soon be incredibly huger than it is now, and eventually the reliability and stability of the system would make the case for white market adoption too profitable for even governments to ignore.
3. Speaking of government**s**, it's not as if the world would come together in banning Bitcoin. Whatever countries refused to would be given a golden pass to the future, and their success would not be ignored for long.
4. Any movement in this direction also moves us a giant step toward end-to-end encryption of everything as standard. Remember: the internet treats censorship as damage and routes around it. Cryptographers have long wondered why encryption is not used by more people; well if there is a crackdown on Bitcoin, there will suddenly be a massive incentive to do so.
**Tl;dr**: The genie is out of the bottle. The worst governments could do is slow it down, and that window is closing fast.

Although the authors may argue this in their models, I don't think it's actually necessary to record information about actual goods and services, or even about who received something they considered valuable from whom. The logic of the argument only requires, roughly speaking, that the memory records how much "gifting" a person did, and Bitcoin does this. The fact that it doesn't do more is actually a strength because of anonymity and fungibility considerations.
A more streamlined argument without all the economics jargon is presented [here](

What it does for Bitcoin growth is that it makes BTC less burdensome to hold, which is a consideration for some. It eases the chicken-and-egg problem of "no consumers &lt;---&gt; nothing to buy," by making it easier to buy things with bitcoins and thereby increasing consumer familiarity with shopping using BTC, as well as the number of bitcoin holders, which boosts merchant adoption.
As the economy grows in this fashion, eventually more merchants should be comfortable dealing with bitcoins directly, as the incentive for doing so grows along with the percentage of their sales to bitcoin holders.

This. Mining was designed to solve exactly this centralized distribution issue, yet OpenCoin throws up its hands pontificating on equitable ways to distribute the money. It sounds too much like the Soviet Union pontificating on equitable ways to distribute wealth in their system. They get to decide what's fair, with "input" from the community and of course it all being predicated on them keeping half the entire market cap for themselves.

Bitcoin is 10% a useful currency now, and 90% an investment with the promise of becoming a (very) useful currency in a few years. Before it can really become a currency it has to have a much larger market cap, which means a much higher price. No real way around it. 
So in the meantime people are happy it's going up, both because it brings people in and builds out the infrastructure and enables larger market cap, and of course because people who support it early are getting rewarded financially for their risk-taking.

With Litecoin, the first quarter-confirmation comes 4x faster, but of course it takes four LTC confirmations to reach the level of confirmedness that one BTC confirmation has. But yes, as far as just wanting the bare minimum of confirmations (one, or a quarter of one), Litecoins seems to have an edge.
However, a single LTC confirmation is way easier to double spend, so it may be a wash.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:20:30
Litecoin has a slower time to reach the same level of security as a Bitcoin confirmation. Confirmation time is just about granularity. 4 Litecoin confirmations = 1 Bitcoin confirmation. Both take about 10 minutes. But that 1 Bitcoin confirmation is backed by massively more mining power, network scrutiny, track record, and dev support than those 4 Litecoin confirmations. 
The only tiny advantage Litecoin might have is that the first confirmation comes sooner. But that increases orphan blocks and may pose other security threats. Litecoin hasn't been stress-tested enough to know. That lack of a track record is a severe and almost insurmountable disadvantage.

The number of low-hanging fruit increases exponentially as the market cap does. A year ago no major company was accepting Bitcoins, few people knew what it was, no one was talking about it in the mainstream, there was an incredible dearth of user-friendly info on both investment and use, the market cap was too small for wealthy individuals to take a position without dramatic price slippage, no one had any idea if bitcoins were even legal or what regulations applied to them or how to deal with their tax implications, venture capital was virtually nonexistent, there was no way at all for institutional investors to get involved, exchange infrastucture was meager and centralized at MtGox, there was a constant stream of major scams and heists as early adopting companies fumbled around trying to establish security best practices, and in my opinion there was a lot of of misunderstanding around what Bitcoin really was about and what was driving its forward potential.
I think we'll continue to see a dance where major price growth takes turns with surges in the development of infrastructure, basic code, new ideas built on top of Bitcoin, public understanding, and regulatory clarity. As one takes the led, the other will follow. There could be a similar dance among different countries: while the US turns to focus on development China or countries hit with monetary instability may get into an investment frenzy.

He does know better. Austrian economists sometimes, carelessly in my opinion, use the term loosely to mean just "value from something other than monetary utility." The argument regarding Bitcoin is that no one ever valued it for a non-monetary use, so it can't be valuable now (Mises's regression theorem). Of course that isn't the case, since people did value it for various experimental/sentimental/speculative reasons rather than in order to make a transaction, but the response from such people is that "that valuation was minor/niche," as if that matters.

I sometimes post off-the-cuff thoughts to and and get some great responses, enough that I start to wonder if I could be getting substantial tips if I dedicated more time to it. The problem of course is that there's been no tipping mechanism. 
I'm considering investing some money into tipping in subreddits like those to set a precendent. If it takes off, many pickup gurus are going to have a new way to make a lot of money. The seduction community is one where people have problems that can 1) often be quickly easily solved by certain experts, 2) people are more than willing to pay for a solution that works. I've had so many guys tell me my off-hand advice has changed their life and gush with gratitude. It seems perfect for tipping. Not only for the "teachers" but also for the students, because they finally have an easy way to arrange one-on-one counseling sessions with prominent PUAs without having to go through any kind of rigamaroll. Even amateurs can trade good tips with each other. Quality posting ensues?

Without a free market, it's all down to the whim of central planners. The market signal that would otherwise say, "No, this is not a viable place to build a house given your income level and needs," is absent. It's an economy sitting on a pile of fluff, with no ability to do a rational cost-benefit analysis.

It gives would-be sellers another option besides selling. 
For example, say the price of bitcoins doubles two more times, to $170 or so. At that price many here might want to sell some just to lock in a bit of profits, or maybe take a little vacation with the money. If you wanted to book a hotel, you'd have to sell BTC on an exchange, then use the national currency to book the hotel (or pay off your credit card, depending on the timing). These kinds of services make it faster. 
If you can book a hotel, order pizza, and buy a new laptop all with bitcoins, it starts to be rather convenient compared with selling them.

He could have a way. All he has to be able to do is get some kind of secret passphrase to a trusted person on the outside. Or with the right methods the person wouldn't even have to be trusted (he could sign the transaction before giving it to the person to push out into the blockchain, though that might require a computer or at least a calculator).


Sure he could, though most won't accept BTC. Still if the amount is huge enough, they may be motivated to learn the ropes.

Direct Bitcoin acceptance at the retail level isn't likely the next step. The next step is incorporation of Bitcoin into (international) companies' backoffice functions to help them move money around. 
Think PayPal, Western Union, international banks, even credit card companies and later maybe even small national governments. It's simply not consumer-friendly enough yet, but businesses have no problem training employees to work with Bitcoin for moving money around internationally. As soon as they understand the value proposition and the regulatory landscape is clear enough, a number of companies are going to realize they're losing a hefty chunk of cash by not incorporating Bitcoin. Then so will their competitors, and it just dominoes from there.
Once these companies are used to working with Bitcoin, accepting it at the retail level will be a piece of cake.

Interesting, never heard of this before. My own take is that being anti-state doesn't mean being *libert*arian or *voluntar*ist any more than it means being *prosperit*arian or *safety*ist. A society without a large central monopoly would mean more liberty, but also more prosperity and safety. Why just choose one? Calling yourself a libertarian or an individualist makes sense if you are a minarchist, since you advocate not allowing governments to step on your freedom and not falling into the collectivist trap of viewing groups as being able to act. It doesn't make sense, though, from a fully anti-state perspective because there's no particular reason to privilege greater freedom over greater wealth or safety *when there is no central government* to violate your freedoms so egregiously.
Moreover, anti-statism needn't entail a rejection of all authority - only large centralized authority. Even most libertarians admit of authoritarian relationships within families, at least up to a certain age, and some even in extended families and tribes. The problem comes when the "tribe" gets so large that our instincts cannot keep up. Past tribes of 50-200 people, evolutionary discordance starts to be a factor; in a tribe of 300,000,000 people like the USA, things really start to go haywire.
Now to HBD, the Austrian starting point that "only individuals can act" is not undermined by the fact that genes are optimized for survival and replication, simply because the subject of economics is human actors. Either way, this is a moot point because the rejection of collectivism is all that anti-statism really requires, not the embrace of "individual rule" or autarchy. 
In summary, it seems that the evolutionary perspective provides the clearest lens for the problems with statism, as well as the inconsistencies of some anti-statists, but I'm not sure HBD has it entirely correct either. It seems more a case of having been a libertarian (anti-statist) for the wrong reasons (due to Rothbard, etc.) and then dropping the whole thing, rather than seeing the core reason why statism is problematic, which coincidentally happens to be explained by similar evolutionary reasoning. 
EDIT: I read the blog post. Some very interesting and controversial ideas about how people might even be different in terms of how large of tribes they will respect, and that these differences may have come about relatively very recently. I'll have to consider this more.

It's arbitrary since what we call "a bitcoin" is itself just an arbitrary sliver of the total money supply in the ledger. We could just as easily call a bitcoin what we now call "1.05 BTC," and then there'd only be 20 million "bitcoins" issued.

Case 1: Bitcoin always goes up. Then people will simply charge lower prices in BTC, since both buyer and seller *know* the price will rise.
Case 2: Bitcoin doesn't always go up. Then you're not always going to see an increase in value; sometimes a decrease. If you see more increases than decreases, the convention among merchants will be to give discounts for payments in BTC.

Science kind of has to be in order to make it what they want it to be (mainstream academia mouthpiece) and not a free-for-all of alternative ideas and religious debate. We don't have that need here. At most I can see moderation of altcoin stuff that isn't Bitcoin-related...but no, even for that I'd rather see it if it rises to the top, because it's usually helpful as a way of keeping your finger on the pulse of the market.
Heavy handed moderation just plain sucks. If it has to be done it has to be done, but the level of suckage it is countering has to be extremely high and frequent. This subreddit is not even 1% that bad on most days, and maybe 10% that bad on crazy price movement days. But I'm happy to be informed when people are losing their shit. It really helps with trading.
For example, if people are upvoting and failing to effectively counter a stupid meme that smacks of irrational panic, I know cheap coins and easy money are on their way.

It will make banks more efficient, just like everything else. The Internet may have diminished the post office in importance, but it did not in any way diminish communication. Likewise, Bitcoin may diminish traditional banks in importance (at least the laggards who refuse to adopt it), but it will in no way diminish the legitimate practice of banking. It will simply make it more efficient, transparent, and predictable. A rising tide lifts all boats, everyone will profit more than they are so there's nothing to fear. And banks who understand the opportunities Bitcoin presents first - like those who understood the Internet first - will reap the rewards in increasing market share.

Inflation is usually harmful because it is usually centralized: the government and corporations with government contracts get the newly issued money first, before the general price levels in the economy rise, so they get to buy stuff cheaply, whereas by the time the money trickles down to wage earners, these commonfolk have already been paying inflated prices for months or years.
In short, the inflation ripples through the economy in an uneven way that benefits the government, the corporatocracy, banks, military-industrial complex, etc. at the expense of those least connected with the government. It's thus an essential tool for states' maintaining control and keeping their friends happy, not to mention functioning as a tax on the general population that few people notice.

It's like no one of these critics think of risk management. Most of the early adopters weren't wealthy, and so a reasonable level of risk management would force them to sell a huge part of their BTC holdings as the price rose from pennies to dollars to over $100. At each doubling a sound risk assessment would require divesting significant amounts of bitcoin. Some people didn't and won't do that and will end up insanely rich if Bitcoin succeeds as a reward for their austerity and longshot gambling, but those will just be a lucky few. The rest will be merely wealthy, assuming they don't lose most of it on the way.

Since Second Market launched the Bitcoin Investment Trust, it has had to buy bitcoins through its dark (non-exchange) channels to keep up with any investor interest they had. Those purchases have a time-delayed effect on the exchange price, as coins that would've been sold on exchanges are not there, making coins scarce and prices higher. The reasons and timing are obscured by the time delay.

The author calls Bitcoin memory "imperfect" when it is in fact more perfect because it preserves fungibility. It is completely perfect for serving the memory function these papers refer to.
This has direct implications for the later argument where Bitcoin is depicted as "coexisting" with existing currencies because "both are imperfect," when in fact Bitcoin *is* perfect (for the purposes of the argument, in terms of memory function). This means that the author's conclusion, properly adjusted, is that Bitcoin will replace money entirely in almost all environments.

People will gradually learn that Bitcoin is a system of humans, in that way bearing a passing resemblance to, say, the New York Stock Exchange. It is different in that it is organized in bottom-up fashion, though with some *de facto* central command that isn't compulsory. It will continue to have hiccups as it grows, some small and some possibly large. Depending on how things play out, any of these hiccups could set Bitcoin back a few months or even years. 
This is why we are still in the early adopter phase. To understand how to value Bitcoin, you have to understand its organic nature. Most people won't. They will be stuck in the mindset that Bitcoin is a business, rather than a growing organism. They will be late to the party, and those that understand Bitcoin earlier will take their money.

Well sure, piecemeal libertarianism is no libertarianism at all. 
For example, most libertarians are happy when environmental regulations are removed, but they may not be aware that some of these regulations actually end up compensating for previous government perversions of tort law dating back to the 1800s, which vastly weakened an individual's ability to sue companies for polluting rivers and air. It is possible that removing certain regulations can actually make things worse from a libertarian perspective, provided that other regulations remain in place.
A more consistent libertarian position is that government is like a cancer. Changing it, even by cutting off its blood supply or poisoning it in some way, won't always have the desired effect. The only thing that works is complete extirpation - and even doing that too suddenly could end up killing the host.

This is what happens when people assume Bitcoin is currently optimized for commerce, rather than to store your wealth in a portable and hide-able form with no third-party risk.
Because of these extraordinary functions, anyone with significant wealth would be *imprudent* not to own a few BTC. The only thing stopping tons of people from buying a few bitcoins is that they do not understand this. 
Increase the understanding, increase the price. Communication is key. We need high-powered explanatory materials, engaging videos, prezi presentations, essays, etc. for wealthy people so they can understand why having a few BTC is indispensable if they want to have an escape route when things get dicey.

Why is everyone under the impression that Bitcoin is primarily a currency? If you look at what most people do with it (buy and hold, spend a bit as their stake grows large relative to their former net worth), it is obviously primarily a store of value, like gold. It currently has niche currency uses, and niche anonymity uses, which provide final backing as a store of value so that we can know it is unlikely to go to zero except in the event of a catastrophic glitch.

You wouldn't need to ask if you understood more about Bitcoin. With some research you'll either see that it is going to revolutionize the world or it's destined for the dustbin. If the former, it will be obvious that the prices are going much, much, MUCH higher from here. So do your research and then buy confidently. But buying a little right now can't hurt either.

Though actually, gambling has its uses. If you have only $100 and some mafia dude is going to cut your arm off if you don't pay him $1,000 in the next 20 minutes, the option to gamble looks a lot more appealing. You at least have almost a 10% chance of keeping your arm, versus losing your arm but keeping your $100.

I don't know what the rules are regarding liquidation of seized assets, but for example if they had to give notice of the liquidation date, or even if people had some general idea of when it could happen, many would move fiat into exchanges and keep their fingers on the BUY button (of course this itself could cause a crash as people sell coins in anticipation, hoping to buy back on the fed plunge - in any case the effect on the price would likely be quite temporary).

Your assertion that it is insane to think Bitcoin will produce more billionaires than the world has ever seen is merely an assertion. Sometimes reality is surprising; many intelligent and successful Bitcoin proponents, such as Chamath Palihapitiya, believe this is one of those times. Being gobsmacked by what could be underway is not an argument.
Buffet's "when everyone is greedy" implies all or most of the market participants. The problem is, unlike stock markets, only a tiny portion of the prospective participants have entered the market at all, even among the few who have noticed it and have the technical skills to grok it and secure it. Everyone was greedy in 2011 when the price was in single digits, tens and briefly twenties/thirties. Short-term his advice would have helped, but if interpreted long-term as you're attempting to do here it would've lost you a minimum of a 1000% return in 2.5 years, and probably closer to 10000%.

It could easily go as low as the $30s, then revert to the exponential norm at around $70. It would be back above $200 - this time solidly - by the end of May, and over $1000 by the end of August. 
The reasoning here is that all the fundamental adoption indicators are following a roughly exponential growth pattern, and there was very steady exponential price growth until a few weeks ago when it started going faster than exponential. Reversion to the mean simply means we have to wait until January to hit $10,000. Boo hoo.

What we call "money" always turns out to be either units of account in a ledger system containing a memory of who provided how much value to whom (bitcoins, etc.), or substitutes for such a ledger/memory system that through their scarcity end up also transmitting useful price information (gold, etc.).
The Austrians have mostly failed to see that a societal system of using gold as money only works because it happens to be a special case within the larger category of systems that faithfully transmit price information. Any system that accomplishes that can function just as well, and it turns out that a system designed precisely with that goal in mind from the start can be far superior to the use of gold.

Something can be risky but still serve to preserve wealth, especially if its volatility is by far exceeded by its appreciation long term - and it is. Also, it's situational. If you lived in China or Argentina (or Cyprus) you might see things differently. Also if you traveled a lot, were in a risky occupation or political situation, or if were ultra-wealthy.
That's why it's generally called an investment/store-of-value or Gold 2.0. For some the investment aspect is more important, and for others the teleportable deniable store of value is.

This is a new insight to me, and it seems ingenious. "Never" is too strong, but "never for very long" seems correct, because any large surplus of mining power will drive down profits for all miners, causing natural attrition back to the level appropriate to disincentivize a 51% attack according to the market cap. That is, even as the BTC price grows to astronomical levels and paints a huge target for attackers, the security network fortifies itself to the same degree.
EDIT: The new insight is that mining power not only grows to meet attack incentives, but that it grows no more than necessary (except for temporary spikes) so it can never be called wasteful.

This is an equivocation. Volatility has an "effect" on purchasing power, but at any given time that effect is just as likely to be positive as it is negative. The only thing that matters for how many people get fed is whether the price is down or up when they cash out. And the general trend for Bitcoin is unmistakably up. If Bitcoin is to succeed in the next decade at all, the trend must continue rapidly upward (albeit not at these rates).

It's very common in fields like mathematics, even if some style recommendations go against it. 
See for example: [
The fact that Satoshi used "we" is more likely indicative of his academic background (math professor?) than that he was actually a group. 
ETA: My theory on why mathematicians use it is they don't want to use "I" but they also don't want to sound as stodgy as scientists always using the passive voice. There's no need to sound like you're being unmistakably "objective" in mathematics, so they are fine with writing, "We present a method for..." instead of "A method is presented for..." and won't use "I present a method for..." because it sounds less modest or draws too much attention to oneself.

But insofar as this is just people following the herd, it will get unwound. 
A claim of double-exponential growth or increasingly parabolic growth requires a very solid argument. We usually see an increasingly parabolic pattern only just prior to bubble bursts. 
However, the recent correction has actually returned the growth to the merely exponential rate of the past few weeks. If we do go over $1000 this week, it will be back in "increasingly parabolic" territory.

Perhaps this is a good time to point out what I find to be the most fundamental and pervasive misunderstanding of Bitcoin even among the Bitcoin community: that Bitcoin is primarily valued as a transactional currency. I will argue that in fact Bitcoin is currently NOT primarily valued as a medium of exchange or transactional currency, but as a gold-like store of value and speculative investment (an excellent one, if you agree with Peter Thiel that it has a 20% chance of going mainstream - a 20% chance of 100x or 1000x growth), and why this is not a bad thing.
To any who doubt this, consider whether you agree with a nearly equivalent statement: "Most people who have bought bitcoins so far have done so primarily in order to enable a purchase, rather than to improve their financial position." Except for Silk Road afficionados, I don't see this being true. In fact I don't even see most bitcoiners considering this to be the case. Yet, it seems to me quite contradictorily, most show signs of thinking that Bitcoin is primarily valuable as a currency. 
I understand I am suggesting two very unpopular, almost taboo things: 1) Bitcoin is primarily a great way to preserve and grow (and hide and move) wealth, and 2) SR remains the shining star in the otherwise relatively barren world of Bitcoin commerce.
However, it is critical to distinguish carefully between the reason for Bitcoin's present valuation and the reasons it will likely be valued in the future. For example, the fact that Bitcoin will probably save online retailers tons of money in the future makes Bitcoin valuable not as a currency now, but as an investment now and a currency in the future. It's easy to misinterpret the fact that its *future* as a currency is largely what is driving its current valuation to mean that it is right now, today, valued largely because it enables transactions. People buying bitcoins now because they believe they will be sought out for transactional purposes *in the future* is not the same as people buying bitcoins now because they are sought out for transactional purposes *now*.  
This is not a merely academic distinction.
Symptoms of missing this subtle difference include: lumping the "buy because Bitcoin will become the foundation of the financial internet" speculators in with the "buy because price is rising" speculators, misconstruing the lagging transactional interest as necessarily problematic, judging the price as overvalued based on present-day transactional use, and generally being suspicious of healthy speculative interest (based on future promise, not price movements) even though it is the obvious main driver of several prerequisites to healthy Bitcoin commerce environment:
* Lower volatility (via higher market cap)
* More users (even if they are initially motivated by financial gain)
* Better infrastructure (more lucrative situation for entrepreneurs)
* Greater/better media presence (buzz from price rise, etc.)
* Generally being taken more seriously (due to higher market cap, etc.)
Investors who understand Bitcoin's potential do it a ~~valuable~~ indispensable service. They inform the public, through price information, of that which most of the public is unable or unwilling to figure out on their own: that Bitcoin has tremendous potential to change the world and warrants serious attention, both currently for certain people as a hide-able, unconfiscate-able, transportable, no-third-party-risk store of wealth and in the future for everyone as a transactional currency (and as the cornerstone of the financial internet).
Just because it turned out to be better for the "store of value" function first is no reason to worry overly about the transactional function taking time to blossom - that's what investors are for. The ones that invest based on a sound assessment of Bitcoin's future potential serve as a proxy for actual present commercial adoption by boosting the price in the present to a degree commensurate with how likely commercial adoption will be to take hold in the future. To misunderstand this is to misunderstand investing itself, as well as to misconstrue much of what is happening in the Bitcoin world.
Despite these points, I think many will be left with a lingering sense that the investment aspect of Bitcoin is somehow dirtier or less legitimate than commercial adoption. Whether or not that is the case, prematurely using commercial adoption as a measuring stick for Bitcoin's success doesn't really make much sense. Bitcoin is a many-splendored thing, and is valued by investors - rightly I think - for both its current and future uses.

The price is correcting upward now and should return to merely exponential growth (on the order of 10x per year, as has been the trend all along) eventually. Of course with the usual caveats that markets don't move in straight lines, don't panic the price will rise and fall sharply as it grows, etc.

Yes, eventually - when either fees become annoying for users or miners balk due to tiny fees, or both - a fee bidding market will emerge where people pay for the speed they need (and no more) and miners prioritize accordingly to maximize their own profit, which also happens to be the best way to provide satisfactory service to the greatest number of users.

The argument is that people are free to submit, but they aren't free *not* to submit. Sure, a non-poor person could move to another country (where they are also not free to not submit), but the question is why they should have to move in the first place? Why doesn't the government move if it can't submit to the will of the people it's supposed to be serving? Or at least allow people to opt out?
However, it's ultimately a bad argument because even a stateless society effectively forces people to submit to its (organically formed) rules in order to live in that society. The problem with government isn't that it forces people to submit to its dictates; it's that it has a monopoly on that privilege.
But even that isn't quite right: a family or small tribe functions with quasi-monopoly power vested in tribal elders or maybe split with warriors as the case may be. Humans are arguably adapted to function well when there are such "governments" covering about 50-200 people (Dunbar's number for ancestral tribe sizes). 
Submission to some degree of authority probably worked at these scales, when everyone knew everyone else and no completely decisive power was wielded by any one person or sub-group. This system starts to break down as tribes grow larger, and becomes totally comical in a "tribe" of hundreds of millions of people like the United States.
Basically we are adapted to respect the authority of the largest tribe in our geographical region, but that hardwired tendency betrays us in the modern environment of gigantic populations. The answer is decentralization.

Speculation is a slippery word. If a billionaire stashes 1% of his assets in Bitcoin simply because it becomes wealth no one can know he even has, it can't be confiscated, can be transported across borders, and can be sent anywhere in the world instantly and with no third-party risk - the ultimate offshore account - does that count as "speculation"? 
If yes, clearly not all speculation contibutes to volatility. If no, then it'd be useful to define another major category of Bitcoin usage besides as a medium of exchange and vehicle for speculation: Bitcoin as a store of value. What it lacks in stability it makes up in invisibility, teleportability, unconfiscability, and complete lack of third-party risk. Not to mention a historically consistent tendency to rise in value dramatically on a yearly basis.

Now it's not technically binary, since it has various high valuations it could reach depending on just how much functionality it takes over in the world, but all of them are much much higher than now. Alternatively, it fails to gain or maintain traction for any of those functions, and goes to zero.

I'm not sure why you're being downvoted. 
$10 fee *is* insane to expect on a free market with frictionless competition driving profit margins near zero. Assuming a free market, expecting $10 fee to be standard is tantamount to expecting it to cost nearly $10 for a miner to process the transaction, because if it cost less - say $2 (still insanely high) - there would be plenty of miners willing to do it for $3, $2.50, or more likely around $2.01. 
Now if people want to pay that much out of appreciation for the miner, that's of course fine, but the miner is doing very little work so it's also kind of shrugworthy - but that's a matter of personal preference.

The error is, you should be looking at purchasing power, not "wealth" as that can be vaguely defined.
If you spend all your bitcoins on landscapers for your mansion, housekeepers, butlers, chauffeurs, masseuses, cooks, jugglers, strippers, whatever, then all these laborers have all your coins and you have nothing but well-kept grounds and good memories. They have the purchasing power now, and you don't.
There are very few consumption goods you can buy that don't reduce your future purchasing power. Yachts are probably the worst example. And just because you don't buy a yacht directly from a poor person doesn't mean poor people aren't getting paid in making the parts and servicing it. The person you buy it from also has to pay for stuff like food, etc. 
The reason the rich get richer, excluding the obvious cases where people are rich because of talent in investing or entrepreneurship or highly marketable skills, is because the centralized power of governments allows them to lobby for favors that maintain their position. They learn how to play the game. Bitcoin erodes that dynamic. 
In a Bitcoin world, the only way a non-skilled person can maintain their wealth is by conserving it to some degree, by deferring consumption. Whatever consumption they do engage in will to that extent distribute the coins to others and fairly quickly to poorer people - it's not the yacht owners that are growing their food, driving their ambulances, guarding their gates.

The only real (essential) reason for using physical or fiat money is as a sort of memory of who did what for the community.  It turns out that if your memory technology is awesome enough to keep track of all transactions at all times in all places instantly without having to worry about whether the memory is accurate, you don't actually need dollars or gold.

For many people, the word "speculative" implies short-term price chasing. Bitcoin is currently mostly an *investment* instrument, which is not a bad thing insofar as it represents prescient people buying bitcoins now in anticipation of Bitcoin's future transactional value. 
What investors contribute to the societal division of labor is to boost the price of anything that promises to be valuable to society in the future. They put in the time and energy to correctly identify such assets so that the rest of the population doesn't have to. The "bat signal" to everyone else is the rising price, and the rewards go proportionally to those who recognize the asset's future promise earlier. 
This is one of the beautiful ways the price system transmits knowledge through society.

The thing is, from the moment a market for a coin exists, mining becomes just another way to obtain it besides *buying* it. The free market ensures that the price to buy a new coin will not be very much higher than the cost necessary to mine it. And these days, exchanges like bter and cryptsy take on new coins almost immediately. 
This reduced friction means that mining most coins is only marginally more cost effective than straight-up purchasing, especially for people who don't have great equipment already. 
Because of this, mining isn't about distribution anymore; it's simply a reward for securing the network. The bulk of the issued coins will go to those who can afford them and/or those that take great risk and end up being correct about the coin's promise. It is wealth-distribution-neutral, and cannot be made otherwise because there's absolutely no guarantee a coin will be valuable in the future (most of them will have a value of zero). Risk is always a major factor, otherwise there can be no major upside possibility. Only investing talent can reduce that risk.
As Risto Pietila mentioned today, with these ubiquitous altcoin markets, the moment you mine any coin - no matter how fairly distributed it might be, even if it was a CAPTCHA-based coin - you're immediately an investor, because you're choosing to hold on to the coins in hopes of future growth rather than sell them for immediate benefit. Investors forego consumption (such as a new car) in the present in hopes of possible gains. They're only rewarded if they have exceptional foresight. There's absolutely nothing unfair about it, except that some people are better investors than others...but that's a problem for educators, not cryptocurrency creators.

For a while I was wondering why you'd want machines to transact for you rather than just telling them yourself, but I now see that you could program the parameters but you'd want the machine to decide based on all the little situationals during its operations.
For example, you might program your driverless car to optimize for speed even if it cost a lot, but you wouldn't want to set asking prices for every little road maneuver yourself. Without Bitcoin driverless cars could still talk to each other, but what they would do for each other would be limited to mutually beneficial actions. With Bitcoin, these machines could do things for each other even if they entailed one of them giving up some convenience, since that could be rewarded monetarily.

I think people are promoting the currency angle overly much at this time due to social effects that make promoting a store of value somewhat taboo (looks like a ponzi scheme, etc.), but ironically the store of value aspect is the far more valuable one, and is the main thing that justifies the 10x per year price growth we've seen every year (but maybe not this year's 50x growth).

Microtransactions are here to stay, just not necessarily with the presently de facto main client.

Not to single this one out (and this isn't the submitter's fault), but why are half the posts that make it to Page 1 lately appearing twice? If people are upvoting both submissions in an effort to get more attention on a single story, consider that there are many people who will only upvote the first one they see. The result is a lower score on the more popular submission than there would have been, and worse, a discussion fragmented between two posts.

The speculators who bought into the hype are who is left holding the bag. 
Historically, the problem with premined coins is no one trusted them or believed in them enough to justify the centralized distribution. Gradually people have realized that premines still make significant money off the unwitting, and that whatever can be done to inspire confidence in the coin and distract people from what the scheme really is will result in a larger take for the creators. 
Associating your pre-printed coin with some promising technology people know about (Ryan Fugger's original Ripple concept) by tacking it onto that system, saying it is necessary for some function, saying it is "worthless" and not meant as a currency, throwing up your hands about how a digital good could possibly be dstributed fairly (hint: proof of work), keeping the source code hidden while calling it "open," and covering all this over with extensive marketing and aggressive guarding of the Ripple name - this is a recipe for making the really big bucks off your premined altcoin. With any luck, you'll get rich before even releasing the source code!

I know there's an escrow system, but I don't see the point for in-person transactions. There are some things you can do to mitigate risk:
1) Reputation system on localbitcoins.com. The more reviews without any negative feedback, and the longer they've been on the system, the better.
2) Meet in a public place with people around, like a coffee shop or mall. Maybe bring a friend or someone with you as well. If the person looks shady or whatever, cancel the deal, unless maybe they're willing to wait for two confirmations before you hand over the cash. Generally if you feel weird about the person or they look too smooth or whatever, it might be a good idea to find another seller.
3) If possible, transact in smaller amounts in the first meeting, going progressively higher as you build trust. Or if you both don't mind, you could do several transactions in one sitting.
4) You need a wallet or at least an address where they will send the bitcoins. If just an address, bookmark the address on blockchain.info so you can check confirmation status during the meeting. 
5) Meet and sit down, maybe chat for a bit to get a feel for the person. Then give them your address. Make sure it's double checked as being the right address. They should send the coins. When you get two confirmations, hand over the cash. Or they may want cash up front. I don't know, everyone probably has slightly different expectations. When it comes down to it, one of you has to trust that the other won't just run off with the cash/bitcoins. But see  and 2.

Alts prove Bitcoin is king, they make it more anonymous, they make it more robust by acting as emergency backups with excellent fluidity compared to fiat systems, and they act as hedges. Testnet doesn't involve real-world consequences and wealth changing hands, so it's not adequate for testing the economic parameters/incentives. The chipping away at Bitcoin's value is very limited, as should be expected for the functions the altcoins serve. And for the most part I see little dispute among coin users; it's usually just something like "x-coin is *also* cool, don't discount it."

Thank you for the tip! I've been trying to get people to notice the difference between speculating (playing the markets for short-term gain) and actually using BTC as a very unique part of an investment portfolio that is especially useful for high net-worth individuals.
To put the finest point on it, it seems to me that any billionaire that simply understands Bitcoin will find it reckless not to buy at least a small nest egg in BTC just in case the worst should happen (becomes an international fugative, all assets frozen).
Another more practical thing for normal people: Bitcoin is the only money you can control from behind bars. You know, the old cache-22 where the government freezes your account, preventing you from getting a good lawyer. Never heard anyone mention this.

In some people's opinion. But it hardly matters who is right there, in the long term, because Bitcoin nevertheless *enables* microtransactions. Bitcoin is just a base protocol, like TCP/IP. We are all starry eyed (though legitimately) over a base protocol. As great as Bitcoin itself is, what we have seen so far is just the tip of the iceberg. As just one angle of this, with the trustless and transparent transactions Bitcoin enables, third-party payment processing can be made trustworthy as well (new paradigm), and this then enables microtransactions because of the minimal costs of internal bookkeeping compared to actively using the blockchain for everything. 
I think what we are or aren't seeing right now is a result of just so much new possibility and so many new potential applications appearing that coders and entrepreneurs have their hands full just coming to grips with the multiple paradigm shifts that are taking place all around. When the dust clears on this initial wave of innovation, the world will be quite a different place, even as the number of new possibilities and gobsmacking paradigm shifts in motion has expanded yet further. Welcome to the Bitcoin singularity.

True, but not on the same time-frame. 50,000 BTC bought on an exchange would drive the price way up, but unsustainably. Second Market has dark channels for securing BTC, ensuring little slippage for their clients and a smoother more drawn-out boost to the price, as all those people SM bought from who *would* have sold their coins on exchange do not, over time making coins on exchange more scarce and therefore expensive than they would have been.

Purchasing things is one of the last things Bitcoin is useful for (right now). It is now useful as an investment and store of value (extremely so) based on the promise of its other future uses.

A few people in China have given their impressions in the past few weeks. The consensus seems to be virtually no adoption, though that's not surprising. Think of the US in 2011. 
There seem to be three stages of Bitcoin awareness:
1) Price-chasing/short-term speculation: buying bitcoin merely because the price is rising; any knowledge of Bitcoin itself is more just used as patter or fluff talk to justify the speculation, rather than real understanding of the system and its implications. Since their "belief" in Bitcoin is based mostly on the fact that the price is rising, people at this stage quickly lose confidence during routine corrections. They are weak hands and generally become fodder for day traders, manipulators, and skilled long-term investors who have accumulated enough bitcoin to be comfortable buying the obvious overextended dips and selling a bit on the obvious overextended surges. 
2) Short-term wealth preservation: converting some fiat money into bitcoin to get around capital controls and other one-time restrictions and frictions. This requires some understanding of what Bitcoin can do, but it's limited and situational. People at this stage may hold some bitcoin, but they aren't necessarily any better at keeping it, since they don't necessarily see the long-term potential. 
3) Long-term wealth preservation/investment: buying bitcoin as Gold 2.0, with the belief that it is decently likely to be here to stay because of its future uses as a currency and payment system. People at this stage see the investment potential, but crucially this is backed by a deeper understanding of Bitcoin and its implications. They are strong hands, tend to only trade a small portion of their holdings, and have the mental leeway to choose only the most obvious trades since their convictions are solid.  
Merchant adoption first happens at stage 2, where merchants see Bitcoin as a way to reach previously unreachable customers and maybe take advantage of some free publicity. We have seen such adoption happen slowly over the years.
However, the real merchant adoption will only happen when there are enough who people who own and are comfortable with Bitcoin. Until then it will be mostly about innovators and niche use cases.

Imagine Google took a bunch of $1 bills and declared them "Google bonds" that it would sell on the open market with the promise to buy them back in 5 years for a higher price. They stamp each one and publish the serial numbers of all those $1 bills on their corporate website and in their investor-relations literature. People then trade these $1 bills for whatever price (always at least $1, but probably a lot more). 
The problem is this is rather unwieldy because you have to either physically transport the bills when they are traded or rely on third parties to hold them for you.
With colored coins, you can do the same thing with bitcoins or small fractions of a bitcoin, circumventing the above problem and also simplifying authentication. You can also eventually do all sorts of financial things like escrow, insurance, collateral, etc. without relying on legal enforcement since it can be enforced by mathematical constructions instead (see [this]( for more).

The problem with "government hates Bitcoin" is that government isn't a monolithic, single-minded entity. It's more a collection of fiefdoms, each with their own narrow and usually short-term interests. 
So far so obvious, but this means that even though Bitcoin taking off would be substantially bad for goverment power overall, it just isn't a consideration for most of the actual subgroups that comprise the goverment. A few of the fiefdoms will find Bitcoin directly in their way, but the rest may find it benign or even helpful. I mean, consider what you'd rather do if you were the DEA: bust cartel kingpins or nerds like DPR. One's a whole lot safer.

Check out the [Speculation forum]( for many more views and theories, some with great track records. 
I personally think it's going up, simply because every single indicator I know about strongly points to continuing exponential growth in both interest and users, and since it takes several weeks to get comfortable with Bitcoin before plunging in big money, these seem to be leading indicators. The exponential growth has been very steady on a [log-scale chart]( since January, only frothing up slightly in the past 2-3 weeks, which *may* mean we camp around the 90s for up to a few weeks, though my best guess is we break through $100 by this Wednesday. The big "however" is if there is markedly bad news.

I had a look at the [actual laws]( in the US regarding compelling a suspect to cough up passwords. It turns out that they can't do it without probable cause to believe that specific files are on the computer. Given that, if Ulbricht had things arranged right, they *might* have a hard time proving he's DPR, even if they can prove he logged into Silk Road servers through the net cafe.
EDIT: Relevant section in wikipedia:


In another case, a district court judge ordered a Colorado woman to decrypt her laptop so prosecutors can use the files against her in a criminal case: “I conclude that the Fifth Amendment is not implicated by requiring production of the unencrypted contents of the Toshiba Satellite M305 laptop computer,” Colorado U.S. District Judge Robert Blackburn ruled on January 23, 2012.[20]


The difference between the two rulings is in previous cases, the courts have held that when the government already knows of the existence of specific incriminating files, compelling a suspect to produce them does not violate the Fifth Amendment's rule against self-incrimination. On the other hand, if the government merely suspects that an encrypted hard drive contains some incriminating documents, but lacks independent evidence for the existence of specific documents, then the owner of the hard drive is entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment. In the Colorado case, the police had intercepted a telephone conversation in which the defendant, Ramona Fricosu, acknowledged her ownership of the laptop and alluded to the existence of incriminating documents in the encrypted portions of the hard drive. The government successfully argued that this precluded her from claiming Fifth Amendment protection, since she had already acknowledged the existence of incriminating documents in the case. The Tenth Circuit let that decision stand, though it may consider the issue again later in the process.

If 20% of someone's net worth was in bitcoins three months ago, now 2/3 of it is* since the price rose 1,000% since then. Soon that could become 90% of the person's net worth in an experimental currency that could easily go to zero overnight. 
Many such people will be *very* interested in re-diversifying out of bitcoins.

A ban would drive Bitcoin underground, where end-to-end encryption schemes would emerge, making it so that government can no longer profit from Bitcoin's potential for transparency like it can now. It would simply weaken the countries that banned it, leaving them with slow, inefficient, laggard economies compared to the countries that embrace it. It would drive down the price, but strengthen the core infrastructure like tempering a sword. It would only be delaying the inevitable thrust into the future.

People are talking as if this is unlikely. It *is* unlikely at this stage, but that's partly because Bitcoin has almost unilaterally been marketed as something it isn't (yet): a viable currency. What it already is is a uniquely effective way to hide and invisibly transport wealth. The fact that the price grows rapidly each year is just icing on the cake. Yet it isn't generally marketed this way. 
Bitcoin marketing is stuck in 2011, when the bottleneck was finding some legitimate currency use to function as a backstop to ensure Bitcoin wouldn't just flop over and die. We are past that; Bitcoin isn't going to just die, people are using it enough that it will always have value (barring unforeseen catastrophe).
Now is the time to get the word out to the rich, the wanted, and others whose need for hide-able money is greater than their need for near-term stability.

Part of the problem is that they are called "coins," and in everyday experience coins aren't divisible. mBTC is too many letters for an acronym. I prefer bitcents, for 0.01 BTC. It's intuitive.

Changing the block size doesn't affect anyone's finances; changing coin limit absolutely does. Huge difference. 
Once block size becomes a urgent issue, consensus will be much easier to reach. And consensus isn't really needed.

Even supposing this were true, as the price rises you - yes you! - will eventually want to sell some, so that you can spend the fruits of your wise investment (what's the point of collecting profits if you never actually get to enjoy them?). At such times, if any of what you want to spend it on can be purcased in bitcoins, it is much faster, easier, and incurs less tax liability to do so.
@_date: 2013-10-23 04:58:19
The fun thing about the BIT is that it sources its coins as much as possible through dark liquidity pools (directly from miners and other off-exchange sources) to avoid slippage. That means the price won't rise immediately on exchanges, instead showing up later as the coins that would've been sooner or later been sold on exchange aren't. 
Supposing the BIT has been attracting a decent amount of investment, we may be feeling the effects now or in the very near future. If huge amounts have been purchased, it would likely result in a protracted swell.

Collectivist phrasing, where the government takes on the exact same name as the population and/or territory it governs, is inaccurate and horribly obfuscating. "We are the government," "I owe taxes to the city," "China attacked Russia," and other lazy wording obscures one of the most important distinctions in society.
The people are the ones who create and do just about everything valuable. The governments only try to "channel" that, but as I understand economics that is an impossible goal (too long an argument to make here: see F.A. Hayek or Mises). In the case of this headline, if people believe that they themselves will be less powerful and influential because of the loss of "American power," they may think it is a bad thing, even though it's really just their overbloated government getting a necessary haircut.

1) Bitpay and other payment processors take on the revaluation risks for merchants.
2) Although volatility cuts into Bitcoin's utility as a currency, it attracts speculators who will even out the price swings and raise the market cap to where it becomes less volatile, so it's self-correcting.
3) The entry of investment money also makes it a better gold-like store of value in the face of inflation and other banking shenanigans.
Bitcoin has many uses; it may be that its store-of-value utility will be the first major thing driving adoption for the next little while, with its currency functions largely taking a backseat in the meantime, except for niche uses. Total users seem to be doubling at a rapid clip as all the feedback patterns cycle their way through, and each doubling should substantially change the retail sales picture as well.

WU isn't going to be excited about going into a whole new line of business they know nothing about, taking a huge reputational hit if Bitcoin fails, and having that entire business arm die off in that case.
What they are interested in is raising the bottom line of their current business, and this is where Bitcoin comes in. If you want to sell them on Bitcoin, show how it can *very easily* function as a back end (invisible to customers) to vastly streamline their money-sending business.
They have to be left with the impression that by "not upgrading to Bitcoin" for their back end, they are leaving free money on the table. This is the path of least resistance. If they get comfortable with it, they could maybe look into providing BTC-cash conversion services or even functioning as an exchange, but that's going to be way later.

This is a crucial point, and the ability to imagine such an environment is one of the key things that differentiates luddites and near-field thinkers from visionaries. The near-field thinker will 
* go over each of Bitcoin's characteristics one at a time, without considering the effect of them all in unison
* fail to consider what the system will look like when not-yet-solved but very-likely-solvable problems are resolved (user-friendliness, standardization, a passable degree of public understanding), and then combine this error with the previous one
* fail to consider how the knock-on effects of Bitcoin reaching each new stage of growth and adoption go on to enable the next stage of growth and adoption (for example, Bitcoin reaching $10,000 will enable investment from firms that would move the market too much of they tried to invest now), and then combine this error with the previous two
Only those who can think holistically and imagine the entire system operating to some degree can understand the vision.

Let's differentiate between mere price-chasing (what we might call "blind speculation") and actual investment where someone does their research and realizes what Bitcoin could do to change the world. The former just creates froth but the latter play an essential role in adoption by supporting Bitcoin before it has reached its actual potential as a global currency. The insightful investors are not the type to panic sell, but the price chasers always do, because their whole "faith" in Bitcoin is solely based on the fact that it is going up.

It's actually impossible for Bitcoin not to correct on its way to mainstream adoption.
Because, suppose it never corrected and just kept rising in a steady exponential growth curve. Soon people would notice how it never corrects and always rises, so they would pile in and the growth would go super-exponential. If it *still* didn't correct, ever more people would pile in until the growth rate reached ludicrous levels, like $1 million per coin by next month. At that point, if not before, the price would crash. There's no possible alternative but to have periodic corrections.

Bitcoin doesn't waste energy. As difficulty adjusts to fit the price, it tends toward using exactly the right amount of energy to secure the network from the attacks that would otherwise be incentivized at that particular price point. In theory, Primecoin's use of computing power to discover new prime chains - or any cryptocurrency that uses its mining power for anything useful *besides* securing the network - is that much more vulnerable to attack, because the incentive gap is that much less. That is, it costs less to do a 51% attack because the attacker gets to use part of the investment in equipment to discover new primes chains, so that is subtracted from the cost of the attack. In practice, however, an attacker is unlikely to care much about advancing mathematics. 
In any case, Primecoin is the first interesting coin to come along in a long time.

This graph shows *only* that portion of the price action that is driven solely by bald, sheep-like speculation. Insofar as the price rise or fall is happening due to people simply following the herd, the diagram applies.
Right now I only see a little bit of this sheeple investor action. I'm guessing they account for 2 to 10% of Bitcoin speculators, up from 1 to 2% a few weeks ago. So it is starting to become a factor, and makes the price more vulnerable to knifing down on any bad news, but if it turns out to be a bubble it is so far only a tiny one.

Trade BTC for LTC on Gox, trade LTC for BTC on Stamp. Works only when LTC price is &lt;20% lower on Stamp than on Gox. The speed makes arbitrage finer grained than the fiat system allows for, helping Bitcoin. This means there is some limited utility for a second blockchain, though vanishingly less for a third or fourth. It justifies perhaps a market cap of 1% that of Bitcoin's.

Look at 2011. "Adoption" as in merely people buying doesn't necessarily mean they recognize the fundamental value. I'm not saying adoption isn't going double-exp, but it needs more than the price rising to conclude that.
Anyway, what I'm talking about is very specific: exponential vs. double-exponential growth on a short timescale. Right now we are seeing a short-term fast exponential growth within a slower exponential trend.
It's all right there in the [long-term log chart]( It very well could go double-exponential in the long-term trend, but there needs to be a mechanism, not just pointing to the price, because it is an extraordinary claim.

Bingo. The only reason we aren't seeing a fee market is because realtime fee pricing information isn't readily available to transactors. Users are mostly shooting in the dark when choosing fees. Imagine if buying bitcoins were like that: you log on to MtGox, tell them how many BTC you want, and then make a blind bid that either...goes through or doesn't, possibly taking a day to find out. That'd be preposterous of course.
However, the only reason such obvious measures haven't been put in place is that the fees so far have been negligible so there has been no outrage. Well now that outrage is starting, and will build until something is done. Hopefully the pricing information will be implemented sooner than later, but - if it is the easiest and best solution like I think it is - ultimately it will be.

You can if the other road is severely underserving customer needs or is too expensive. But more likely the more competitive company would just buy it out. There could be holdouts, etc., making this argument more complex, but this isn't that different to any other market situation.


1) I don't know where you're the getting the idea that private companies cannot undertake long-term planning. However, this may partially be the case now due to central bank inflation (difficult to plan long term when you don't know the inflation rate) and regulations distorting the stock market and corporate protections that end up in total incentivising directors to seek short-term profits. I am arguing for complete lack of government regulation on just about anything; I would not necessarily argue for any particular piecewise removal of regulation, since such regulation may have been offsetting the ill-effects of other regulations that would be left intact, resulting in a net loss.
For example, it may be that central planning of roads and railways is necessary or helpful *given* all the other gross interferences in the market that the government undertakes. I doubt it, but I grant that it's possible in principle, due to the offsetting effect. The more regulations, the more of a quagmire this becomes and the harder it becomes to see that regulation (*government* regulation) is the problem in the first place.
2) Social benefits do come from having a highly mobile population. But social costs are incurred in constructing roads and railways. How do we know exactly what point in time that those benefits outweigh the costs? In 1800 it would have almost definitely been a waste of money. In 1970 it would have almost definitely been a great idea. But how to do the extraordinarily complex cost-benefit analysis at a time in between? Market prices and profit motive are the only rational basis for such calculations, which have to aggregate the subjective preferences of millions of individuals, the scarcity of millions of resource inputs that would otherwise be put to other uses, and whether or not it is beneficial to society to divert the skilled labor of tens or hundreds of thousands of people from whatever they would otherwise be doing.

I tend to think (and the conventional wisdom seems to be) that it is a "binary bet" where languishing at intermediate prices is unlikely. The basic reasoning is, I guess, that even just by continuing to function at the current level, Bitcoin adoption will inevitably rise as more people find out about what it can already do for them even in its current state with its current infrastructure. It would go to zero in a catastrophe, and otherwise go very very high. But it's perhaps not been debated enough whether that is really the case.

Other mistakes bubblists make:
* Forgetting that the store-of-value function of Bitcoin is just as important, if not more important, than the payment function. When the price rises "too" quickly, it may undermine the payment function temporarily (though I dispute this), but it must at the same time dramatically enhance the store-of-value function. The price is based on both functions combined, and right now the sky is the limit for store of value. As just one example, post-Cyprus there is suddenly a huge number of millionaires looking around desperately for a value store that cannot be confiscated or capital controlled. Nothing else in the financial world even comes close in this aspect, not to mention privacy.
* Confusing relative growth with absolute growth and failing to notice how miniscule the Bitcoin economy was before this year. The tiny absolute growth entailed in going from super-ultra-niche to just ultra-niche is as big in relative (percentage) terms as going from small cap to large cap for a publicly traded firm. The price growth reflects the relative, not absolute, change.
* Using a conventional price chart instead of a logarithmic one. In a bull market, conventional price charts systematically magnify the most recent relative (%) moves, so that a doubling in price in the past two weeks is distorted to look massive compared to a doubling several months ago. A log-scale chart shows all percentage moves in the same way, without distortion, regardless of the absolute price of the asset at any given time. Bitcoin's price growth since January looks like almost a straight line on a log chart, with only a mild wafting up since Cyprus. This is what should be expected of exponential growth phenomenon, and it is backed by exponential growth in the number of subscribers to the number of blockchain.info My Wallet users, the number of media mentions, the Google trends for phrases like "bitcoin" and "buy bitcoins," and other indicators. Given this steady exponential growth in the price seems coupled with other indicators, it only starts to feel bubbly when the growth steps up *beyond* exponential, as it has in the past few weeks, though only slightly. If this is a substantial bubble, we only entered it two weeks ago and are in the very early stages.

This is a misconception; securing the currency of the Internet against fraud and attacks costs exactly as much as it needs to. This is the way Bitcoin was designed. As the price rises, mining profitability rises and draws in more hashing power both by an increase in the number of miners and the sophistication of mining technology. This rise is commensurate with the incentive to do a 51% attack, which becomes more attractive as the market cap grows. At any given price, mining soon expands or contracts to be exactly as resource-intensive as it needs to be - no more, no less.

What I'm saying is X is not a useful terminology in the field of economics because it encourages reasoning errors that lead to bad consequences. It isn't useful in the practical endeavours of economics and political analysis to lump group "action" with individual action, even though there are in some sense "factions" within a person's mind.
What we are discussing is which terminology to use: should there be a distinction made between human action and human group "action"? Hence it is not only not an error but in fact completely necessary to explain why making that distinction (or not making that distinction) is useful. I am saying it useful to make the distinction because it discourages the common collectivist errors.
If I understand your position, you are saying that Austrian economics arbitrarily considers humans as individual acters (even though there's more nuance to it) and the turns around and criticizes collectivists for treating groups as acters, arguing that there's more nuance to it. Why, indeed, make this methodological distinction in one case and not the other?
The reason is simply to delineate economics from psychology. That doesn't mean that the two cannot eventually be merged to their mutual benefit.
However, I am finally arguing in favor of making the distinction in both cases, rather than in neither. Ultimately, in that more complicated and complete analysis that incorporates both psychology (and maybe even biology) and economics, I'd simply dispense with the word "action" entirely and speak of emergent behavior in all cases. 
I am not adverse to this, but we must recognize that at this point in the development of economics it would be a case of biting off massively more than one could chew for probably little benefit. Even in such a case, though, we would have to - for the purposes of clear thinking about human interactions and not falling into reasoning errors - make a distinction between emergent behavior within a human and emergent behavior of groups of humans.
In other words, however important for biology and psychology it may be to realize that humans are emergent in a way that resembles the emergent behavior of human groups, it is likewise important in economics to recognize that similar does not mean identical. My point about throwing the minority under the bus was simply to show that this isn't a trivial or useless distinction.
Again on IQ we have a similar situation: it is both a great insight to learn that there is likely a genetic component to IQ* and likewise a great insight to realize that it is only a component. It is again a case of not getting so excited about one insight that we dismiss the other, as both "camps" probably tend to do.
*Assuming for the sake of discussion that IQ or intelligence are well-defined terms

I think by far the biggest issue among those is securing bitcoins. These days there are plenty of people who are deeply into technology but don't have the technical chops securely handle bitcoins. Once Armory and Trezor come of age and knowledge of how to use them becomes commonplace, and once it's commonly accepted that bitcoin presents no tax issues, the need for such a trust may mostly disappear. 
However, consider also institutional investors. If you're in charge of investing for, say, CALPERS, what are you gonna do, offer to secure the bitcoins yourself? You'd have to set up a full enterprise-level bitcoin security system with m-of-n keys and all that jazz. Way way easier logistically just to buy BIT shares.

The main difference is Bitcoin is trustless, whereas a bank might do a bail-in on you or let Uncle Sam dip into your deposits. Or the bank could just embezzle your money or make an error not in your favor. This is part-and-parcel with the fact that banks are much more centralized than Bitcoin.

Seems a lot better than those 0% return stores of value. 
But seriously, Bitcoin is different than gold in how it preserves ones wealth, but both provide store of value functionality for different people. Those with low risk appetites should choose mostly gold. But certain people, like the very wealthy, international/perpetual travelers, and of course criminals, find different things to be stores of value, because they are guarding their wealth against different eventualities. For many of them, volatility, especially when it's overwhelmingly in the upward direction, is not as much of a negative for their wealth preservation as counterparty risk, lack of omnipresent access, lack of deniability, jurisdictional risk, inflation, haircuts, account freezes, etc.

Bitcoin has been on a rapid but very steady exponential growth line since January, doubling about every 5 weeks. It only recently started getting ahead of that trendline, so it wouldn't be surprising if it temporarily corrects below it. In any case, that exponential growth trend targets breaking $49 decisively next week or the week after.

Even if this were true it would only be in a small time window. Once bitcoin grows to comprise more 90% of your portfolio, you'd likely sell/spend to maintain portfolio balance. From then on, the more deflation the faster you'd likely spend or sell them. 
Risto Pietila has done some analysis that suggests the average divestiture rate is 17% per doubling. That is, the average Bitcoin investor sells or spends 17% of their bitcoins for each time the price doubles, maintaining a portfolio of 70-80% Bitcoin (though usually after not selling anything during the first few doublings, which is the brief window during which the economic deflation effect happens).
Note that this actually results in *more* spending or dis-hoarding than a stable currency, not less.

Human-made climate change - of course. And no, the impact is not significant. You could find sources that say it is, and I can find sources that say it isn't. It is absolutely not a consensus or even close.

The whole conversation on this issue is obscured by the illusion that the developers control the hard limit, rather than the miners themselves. It is of course the miners who have ultimate control; it's just that they may not know enough about code to patch the software themselves. The devs simply control how *convenient* it is to change the limit. 
This means that when push comes to shove, miners will make whatever size of blocks they want. However, they will continue to be incentivized to make blocksizes reasonable and/or to ostracize any nodes that issue unreasonably large blocks. An equilibrium will develop based on the interplay between miners and fee-paying users, and the OP's idea of a sliding fee scale for different confirmation speeds will likely be part of that, because blocks will probably always end up being as small as they can be without causing problems.
In other words, the current hard limit is probably higher than most miners would have set it otherwise, at least until very recently, which is probably why we haven't seen a fee market emerge yet as the OP envisions. Or actually no, there is so much mining power and so few transactions so far that fees haven't been necessary. However, as the economy grows fees will start to be required, and this sliding scale will probably develop.

To anarchist bitcoiners: Austrian economists are actually careful to point out that Austrian economics is itself politically neutral. It doesn't advocate any political system. However, if you happen to be inclined toward maximizing the prosperity, health, and happiness of the greatest number of people, Austrian economics tells you that the most efficient means of accomplishing this is to have the least amount of government interference in the market. 
Bitcoin also advocates nothing; it is apolitical, just like 3D printing and Google Glass are apolitical. That doesn't mean, however, that these technologies will not move society toward or away from certain modes of political organization.
What the inventors of a technology believed is also irrelevant. If the inventor of the gun were a socialist and believed the gun to be socialist technology, does that make guns socialist? This would be an easy conclusion to fall into, since socialists even advocate for redistribution enforced "at gunpoint." 
No, guns aren't socialist, nor are they libertarian or individualist. This is a reasoning pitfall. Ultimately tools are tools, nothing more. The net effects they have on society are not to be confused with their advocating a certain ideology. If eventually Bitcoins make the world a better place, every ideology will claim Bitcoin as obviously a technology of that ideology.

Because the price of the coins in dollars is going to be equal or approximately equal when you exchange BTC for LTC on an exchange, so any profit or loss should be negligible.

The thing usually missed in the tax debate is that, yes, gov can still tax people in other ways, but there's a reason they spread taxes out. Governments get away with a lot, but they still cannot just do absolutely whatever they want without consequences.
While they *could* levy 300% property taxes to make up for lost tax revenue elsewhere due to Bitcoin, this would be widely decried and revolted against. It would also mess up the property market something awful.

This is the market auto-correcting, contrary to the static thinking that leads mainstream economists to speak of "deflationary spirals."
There is no way for such an unregulated market *not* to self-correct, because insofar as a certain percentage of consumers hoard because the price has been rising consistently, a similar percentage of merchants will for the same reason be incentivized to offer discounts for payment in Bitcoin. 
Conversely, insofar as the price wavers or rises in scary fits and starts, merchants may not offer discounts but for the same reason plenty of people will be looking to get out while they're ahead or otherwise take substantial profits as a hedge against volatility and uncertainty.

Like changing the composition of soil in a garden, when the technology available to a civilization changes, the pattern of what sort of things spontaneously sprout up and thrive also changes. When new technology tips the scale toward decentralized natural order, society inevitably moves in that direction. 
The rise of the Internet has, for instance, made the "censorship is damage and will be routed around" dynamic and the analogous "centralized control is inefficient and will be routed around" dynamic ever more pronounced. We see that on a large scale with the rise of Bitcoin and all the changes it will bring, and on a smaller timescale with lesser innovations like Open Transactions making an end-run around OpenCoin Ripple's attempt at even a moderate degree of centralized control. 
It might be asked whether every type of increase in technology really pushes society more toward decentralized power. Why wouldn't certain technologies have the opposite effect? It seems clear, however, that every advancement in the ability to communicate freely must move us away from monopolistic central authority. If that is true for the communication of information, how much more for the communication of value? Of ownership? Of effect of contract? Of the legal decisions of private courts?
EDIT: What I mean by the last one is, imagine you have an arrangement through assurance contracts in the blockchain and smart property whereby you being too late on your car payments causes your car keys to stop working. That is all fine and good in theory, but real life is more complex. Human arbiters are often needed to determine reasonably how the letter of a contract should be interpreted, especially in extenuating circumstances or ones not envisioned when the contract was drawn up. In a more decentralized world with private, reputation-based courts, some kind of "authority" may be vested in certain arbiters (perhaps specified in advance in the contracts, with such arbiters included into the decision-making process regarding ownership through some manner of M of N scheme). In this way, contract law could be not only much more fair and free from monopoly control, but also much more enforceable - yet free from the clunkiness of pure letter-of-the-law automatic determinations whenever the market deems such to be inappropriate.

There is no end to wants, so there is no end to scarcity, hence no end to money.

You speak as if the "means of exchange" function is the main use of Bitcoin, but even Lead Developer Gavin Andresen sees the store of value function as more important, and the post-Cyprus rally confirms this. Like gold, as long as Bitcoin has *some* non-store-of-value use, its store of value functionality will remain. Tulips? Gimme a fucking break, they aren't even durable or easily verifiable. THAT was a quintessential bubble/mania.

Set of people with Japanese name and strongly British, perfectly native writing style x Set of people capable of creating a system like Bitcoin = Extremely small set, likely a null set. Add to that the fact that Satoshi was obviously trying to remain anonymous so would of course not use a real name, and moreover the name sounds like it carries a message that could be relevant to Bitcoin ("Awaken to the Heart of the Matter" or similar), whereas most Japanese names include landscape features (Suzuki = Bell Tree, Sato = Wisteria, Hayakawa = Fast River, Tanaka = In a Rice Field, Yamamoto = Heart of the Mountain, Koizumi = Small Spring) or otherwise couldn't be interpreted in such a way.

Exactly, closed loops. Any closed loops that can be formed become self-sustaining as the efficiencies that Bitcoin brings are fully realized and there's no going back.
A good next move might be to try to get some SF area supermarkets or restaurants to use Bitcoin. If the wholesaler's customers start to use Bitcoin then they'd both have an incentive to cut out Coinbase/Bitpay and transact directly.
However, I still think Bitcoin doesn't really shine for local transactions as much as online ones.

I view the altcoins as backup, hedging, tumbling, and testing systems for Bitcoin, whereas Bitcoin is the payment system. The question for very Bitcoin-like altcoins (as almost all of them are) is how much mining and development interest they can attract. Primecoin has a unique point of interest in how it generates numbers of slight scientific interest. It may not be much, but how much it marginally stands out from the other altcoins is what's important, and almost no other coin is offering anything other than slight tweaks on Bitcoin. Or if you extend the main cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin and Litecoin, it's even more strongly so that almost none of other coins offer anything other than gimmicks (Namecoin is an exception, and PPCoin might be an exception because it uses proof-of-stake). Next to that paucity of innovation, Primecoin looks quite nice.

The logic of attacking deflation is self-contradictory in the first place. It cannot be that people won't spend because of the belief BTC is guaranteed to rise, while at the same time be that this "flaw" hinders adoption (else BTC would *not* be guaranteed to rise, and in fact should be disposed of as soon as possible).

The monetary regression theorem is irrelevant because Bitcoin isn't money. Granted it is billed as money, but remember there is really no official voice or PR department for Bitcoin.

Localbitcoins with a reputable seller in Laos, or if you can and it proves necessary, make the trip to another country to do the purchase. If you have literally no address, there are probably things you could do but they would all take too much time, except localbitcoins.
Keep in mind there are probably many like you, and the hassle you have to go through is part of why there is so much upside still. Once everyone in, say, Laos can easily buy Bitcoins the price will be much higher. The hours or days you spend doing convoluted and annoying things to obtain those coins could turn out to be ridiculously highly paid work hours. So you could look at it that way, and may who came before you have done exactly that.

You got burned for falling into the prevailing wisdom on this subreddit that "Bitcoin is a currency." 
Bitcoin's functionality is 90% long-term investment, and only 10% currency...and *there's nothing wrong with that*. In fact, it couldn't be any other way. A currency has to have a modicum of stability. Bitcoin simply cannot have that stability until more people invest in it seeking for long-term gains.
As more people move part of their assets into Bitcoin, the upside for investment will gradually decrease, its stability will gradually increase, and its functionality as a currency will start to come to the fore.

Simple: you pay with whichever one you want less of.
Note that even for the most staunch Bitcoin bull, the one you want less of isn't always going to be dollars. If, as happened six months ago, the price just went up 10x and now you have almost all your net worth in bitcoins, it may be sensible to convert some to dollars. 
The exact numbers are down to your situation and risk appetite, but the point is there is some price at which you say, "I need to re-balance things a bit, because dollars aren't completely useless yet." To pay taxes or whatever, even die-hard bitcoiners sometimes want more fiat money. 
At those times (which you'll note are also the most deflationary times) you'll definitely want to spend your bitcoins instead of your dollars, even if you hate fiat money. Of course you could just sell your bitcoins, but spending them is cheaper, can be faster, and is likely more advantageous as a tax strategy.
And as others have pointed out, you could just spend BTC because it's easier and buy them back in chunks later.

Litecoin actually takes longer (way longer) than 1-2 hours to get to a level of confirmation resembling 6 Bitcoin confirmations. LTC only has the edge (possibly) in the first confirmation. It takes 24 LTC confirms to theoretically match 6 BTC confirms, but since LTC is far less secure in terms of mining power, it really takes far more than that. Perhaps hundreds or thousands of times more. 
This means Litecoin is actually orders of magnitude *slower* than Bitcoin at securing a transaction to whatever degree you need. And if Litecoin had as much mining power as Bitcoin, they would merely be equal (LTC would have a definitive edge in getting 1st confirm, granted). As this makes obvious, it's all about the network effect. There's only room for one big boy; the rest play support. That doesn't mean LTC won't be valuable, but it will play second fiddle barring catastrophic failure of Bitcoin (one that somehow doesn't affect Litecoin in the same way).
@_date: 2013-03-25 17:52:37
Gotcha. Never knew it was like that. So basically any extra fee would just be to raise the probability that your transaction gets included in the earliest available block?

Not necessarily, but for certain people in certain situations it's probably the case.  If you have a large amount of BTC it tends to become moreso the case once you've converted a sizable amount to fiat. Also moreso the case for international or perpetual travelers, gangsters, the ultra-wealthy, etc. Everyone's risk profile is different. I'm just trying to give an even-handed comparison, as although Bitcoin is risky as we all know, fiat carries many risks that Bitcoin does not.

Supply is probably the wrong word, and that changes the whole meaning. Should be:


Note that here "services" doesn't mean service-providing companies; it means actual services. So it's not saying the banks can't provide services to Bitcoin-related companies, but rather that the banks can't provide Bitcoin-related services themselves, such as trading, etc.

He's not talking about the actual cost to produce. He's talking about what the industrial value (sale price) of gold would be if all the speculative/store-of-value aspects were stripped away. What would gold be traded for if it were just like a more expensive tin, for example. What would its value be if it were only used in production of electronics,  etc.
The point is that very little of gold's market value comes from its industrial uses; most comes from its use as a store of value.

I'm aware, but relatively the price is much less fixed than for power and mail. Replace apples with RAM or something if that makes the point clearer.


How can we know if the benefits exceeded the costs? Also, see my comment about crowding out: it cannot be known what private companies would have done without the government contractors in the market, bidding up the price of materials, labor, etc. with their relatively lavish budgets. On top of that are regulations that the government isn't necessarily subject to. 
 


And bureaucrats have better foresight than entrepreneurs? On what grounds? 


"How exactly" is the whole point. The decision to invest tremendous resources into a massive project like an interstate highway is an extremely complex one, requiring some rational way to aggregate data on the individual value scales of [every person affected]( both by the highway itself and by the construction of the highway, as well as fairly exact knowledge of the scarcity and value to the rest of society of all the resources and skilled workers that will be diverted to that project. How could a bureaucrat hope to even begin a cost-benefit analysis on all this? 
Fortunately there's this thing called the price system, which impels a profit-driven enterprise to choose the most cost-efficient resources and personnel, and thereby those least scarce and relatively least valued by society for other purposes, and then market test what they would have to pay people to give up their property and how much people are willing to pay for the service (recalling that the fees are going to be way less than they would have ended up paying via taxes). Such entrepreneurs, who are fiercely vetted by the market for their excellent skill in this area - unlike bureaucrats - are the only people close to being in a position to evaluate whether now is the best time to move ahead with a transcontinental railway, interstate highway, or mail delivery system.
This is how the entire productive aspect of the world works. Even government contractors insofar as they operate with any efficiency at all do so because of the market price system, thanks to the fact that the economy is not a complete command economy. 
The question at issue then, I suggest, is why not let the market take an even more active role? I don't pretend that the argument is completely obvious, only that it there is no prima facie reason to draw the line where it is currently drawn in terms of how much rein is given to the market, while there are all sorts of reasons why monopolism is obviously generally bad. A little more on this contention here:

No, but there's also no such thing as not investing in anything. If you're think about buying bitcoins, you're holding dollars or some other thing. Those are all investments, and none of them have an 100% guarantee that you'll make money or even that you won't lose money. Sure, you may not lose dollars, but you can very easily lose purchasing power as those dollars fall in value. No matter how you slice it, you're already investing; you're already gambling. 
Risk is a fact of life. Learn to use it to your advantage or you'll be almost certainly be worse off.

I got an image of Kermit riding up in a Ferrari all blinged out, flanked by Miss Piggies, yelling "BITCOIN BITCHES!!"

Yo dawg, I heard you like risk, so we put a risk of 100% default on your loans through a company that itself carries a risk of 100% loss of the coins you own whose value already had a significant risk of going to $0 anyway.
I'm not sure how btcjam works and if they act as intermediary or not, but **all** your coins?

Not a fallacy, but misleading.

No problem, that's quite helpful. I'll look into this more.

What you say applies to obsession with how many bitcoins you own and how much they're worth, but not to Bitcoin as a technology and how it could change the world. To be fair, though, the whole one-two punch of amazing technological promise and massive profits is extremely addicting. When the price languishes people talk about and develop the technology more, then the price gets interesting again. Never a dull moment.

**ATT**: Entrepreneurs and VCs
Whatever the Bitcoin price does in the near term, there is huge money to be made by simply setting up a halfway decent exchange, in almost any country. 
Let a thousand exchanges bloom!

Exactly. Always ask, "Who benefits?" Politicians and crony capitalists love inflation.

That's what "premined" means: no proof of work used. That is, the creators have come up with some wily excuse or justification why they should be the sole controllers of the issuance and distribution, and why that's OK and even unavoidable/beneficial. It's all about the marketing. If you can actually take a promising idea and attach your coin to that, that is very clever marketing.

The only sort of worrying thing was the word 根強い with regard to illegal activities conducted via Bitcoin. It implies a certain incorrigibility, which I suppose is accurate, but it seems to leave the door to regulation firmly ajar.

Bitcoin, no question.

Yes, but only after you're verified on MtGox. Once verified, you can buy bitcoins in a few minutes or hours during banking hours, for like $5 in bank fees + MtGox fees. The larger hurdle is that no one in Japan knows what a bitcoin is.

Just because decentralization is good doesn't mean every move toward relatively more centralization should be frowned upon and every move toward less centralization applauded. If that were the case, why not make the blocksize way smaller than it is now? That'd make it more decentralized but no one's arguing for it. 
The market will decide the optimal amount of centralization that will keep the system at maximum resilience and functionality. Miners can work it out among themselves. The scare scenarios have, as far as I've seen, all proven to be based on economic reasoning errors, not taking all factors into account, and treating miners like robots instead of rational market acters.

The logic doesn't scale: Imagine Bitcoin went up 30x by summer. Anyone who had bought in last year at $2 would see their net worth explode. Yet it's sitting in a form that might be worthless tomorrow. Think they won't want to spend??

I think parent meant, "...can't touch your coins *if you do it right*."
