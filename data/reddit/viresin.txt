But who will decide which third party is the most trustworthy and who will hard-code them into the system?
In my opinion the decision should be completely in the hands of transacting parties. If the seller suggests unknown and untested insurance provider it'll be an obvious red flag for the buyer, and vice-versa.

By all means. I don't know if you're serious or you're mocking me, but in my opinion those kind of discussions are a good way of explaining where Bitcoin's true benefits come into play. If you have any chance of having a conversation with the lawmakers, fucking go for it!
It's my personal viewpoint but i'm fucking fed up with arguments like "Bitcoin has no value, it's just a giant ponzi scheme for criminals and such". Once people will learn how exactly Bitcoin is radically different - and better - than traditional money and truly experience how it works, they should immediately see it's true value. 
Applying a thought experiment where you apply Bitcoin's properties to government money seems to me like a good way to start when you're talking with laymen. That way at least a few of my friends went "Ooh, now i get how it's different" while previously they thought it was comple nonsense.

The Bank would then have to buy Bitcoin and color the coins before issuing them to the public, i don't think the free 1:1 exchange between national money and digital coins could be maintained in this scenario due to the price swings of both. 
In my proposal there's no mining, no 51% risk, no network. Just a single server maintaining nation's cash flow, controlled fully by the Bank. It's basically cherry-picking of the best features of cryptographic currencies and applying them to old, centralised system. I see it as a intermediate solution before the global nature of Bitcoin truly kicks in.

I read recently that after Argentina's disastrous default the inflation has skyrocketed to 65.4% this year. 
But Bitcoin units - 12.2% the past month? If i'm not mistaken 108,000 Bitcoins have been introduced into circulation in the last 30 days, out of 13,259,085 coins currently in use. That would amount to an inflation rate of 0.815%. Am i missing something?

It's very good sign of the community, however the problems that are currently being discussed can be solved only by sophisticated algorhithms like an "invertible bloom lookup tables", so the technical discussion is really like something from another planet for most. 
And it's not like the discussion recently got so advanced. Even in 2009 when the great Hal Finney got involved with Satoshi Nakamoto to develop and test the protocol, they started by improving the mechanics of elliptic curve cryptography. 
This was clearly conceived by someone with strong academic or quant background. Not to discourage the discussion, but it's some quantum-mechanics type stuff technically. Just trying to get your head around all of that is an awesome intelectual excersise.

I'm just as convinced that open ledgers are the way to go. As i've said, the national cryptographic currency won't solve the BIG issues like remittances and the fact it's pegged to the whims of the national bank. I just think that if done right, it could serve as a intermediate solution. 
I didn't consider a private mining pool before, i agree it would be safer to distribute mining computer across the Bank branches. It would have to be inaccessible from the outside though or it would be 51%'ed almost instantly.

Yep, i was just trying to point out the difference between hardware and software-based approach to something on a global scale. I meant it as a quick way to end any comparisons between the two. 
Now i get how it might seem like i'm glossing over the fact that Apple Pay is only trying to do something that works like public key cryptography for transactions in the Bitcoin network. And even in this regard Bitcoin is vastly superior since if i'm aware you can't yet do multi-sig with multiple iPhones.

You've just described in essence the process of critical thinking. That is the absolute basis of a scientific method, and also a sign of an educated man.  
Unfortunately, most people don't really get critical thinking at it's basic level. Critical thinking isn't an attitude. It's a process, which requires a ruthless intelectual discipline, so you don't fall into the hole of only scanning for arguments that support your preconcieved claims. It should be ESPECIALLY applied to the theories that you support. It's the only way the good science emerges.

Yeah that's the part that is confusing me. However if i understand this correctly the block-chain technology is a very powerful tool for making incentivised and efficient mesh networks. Marc Andreessen pointed out how if this technology existed 40 years ago, we wouldn't have DNS servers today at all and the ISP's would certainly work very differently than their today's business model.

Oh thanks, it's all awesome stuff!
However looking from traditional customer's POV, probably right now they would want to trust a well-known company instead of another one operating solely on block-chain. The delivery companies already provide a similiar service when you pay for the package on arrival, it's just a question of extending it to Bitcoin transactions. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:29:52
You can actually calculate it yourself looking at the previous transactions to that address. 
Most of the coins (35K) were transferred to that address on 3rd of april 2013, so that's 19 462 973 Bitcoin days destroyed. Te rest was mostly added a month later, so at best they would add about 2 500 000 days.
It should trigger a spike on blockchain.info chart, although a minor one. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 12:23:25
You could invite the third-party just to make the transaction instant and irreversible, for instance when you're trading with an online-gambling website, local coffee shop, whatever. The benefit is that the seller can be certain the TX will go through once they see it's been signed by both parties. As i understand it currently the seller can have this certainty only after waiting for the TX to get to the blockchain and be buried under enough blocks. 
My second point is meant to cover the security of physical shipments. As long as both parties trust the delivery company, this arrangement could provide a transparent way to instantly solve eventual disputes. 
Edit: And by the way, thanks for joining the discussion! :) 
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:07:00
That's actually a piece of advice that's very respectful for the Bitcoin community, so i have no idea why on earth people are downvoting you. 
You're basically saying you are considering passing your "torch" to people still in the community, not just cashing out to god knows who and saying "Fuck y'all, For that sole reason i think the community would be worse off without you. We - as any community - need awesome and honest people. You have my upvote and respect, sir. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:09:58
How about if the seller designates the trusted green party and asks the buyer to channel the payment through it? If i get this right currently the bulk of the required trust is on the sellers side, that way they could have the certainty that nothing untoward would happen.
Maybe i'm too rose-tinted glasses on that, but in my opinion the fact that we're operating on a open and free market means that the best services and providers will naturally surface over time. I mean even one reversed transaction would red-flag a third party and make everyone else stop using it. After all the whole point is that you're not bound by anything and can now specify your insurance provider for each transaction separately. 
That's in my opinion a crucial advantage in having a open and free market: it can be self-disciplining and self-policing. I belive this hive mind (instead of the regulation by authorities) is the spirit of cryptographic currencies. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 02:23:08
Oh my god. I skipped over the most important bit of the article - they want to generate a national alt-coin maintained by P2P with dedicated computers as a part of mining, or form their own internal network inaccessible from the outside? 
I have to research it further, but clearly if they're going for P2P it's a total disaster in the making.
Either way you have an awesome opportunity for your startup. If the e-peso won't work you can propose your solution that will. If the e-peso will work, just pivot and make the equivalent of Bitpay in Phillipines. You'll spend the rest of your days throwing truffles at dolphins from your yacht, bored of having so much money.

We have our fair share of spewing out bullshit in Poland currently, and it's really becoming a major problem because it led rise to second political force, about to win in the elections. 
It stems straight from something called Kruger-Dunning effect in psychology. How it works: If you're absolutely no good at something, you'll likely overstate your abilities in this area. It actually requires a certain amount of knowledge and understanding to know how much you suck in a given subject. This goes in reverse for well educated people, they tend to understate their abilities. 
Now we have a swarm of young people convinced by parties that there's a grand conspiracy going on. They believe that the plane crash in Smolensk, 2010 was a plot to murder their president. Suddenly everyone became an expert on the physics involved in plane crashes. Add to that very strong views on economics from people who can't even explain basic principles of capitalism and socialism. Spin city.

That's funny, i'm working on a very similiar proposal to be introduced in Poland. 
To all that say this is a wrong direction and a move that will hurt Bitcoin: it won't. This proposal won't in any way change that peso is still a gov't-issued currency - therefore it's value will still be pegged to the whims of the central bank - and it won't change the costs of remittance since outside of Phillipines you will still have to exchange it for analog money. 
It's like Apple pay - it will introduce some benefits of new transaction system while leaving the BIG issues as they are. 
Bitcoin will be fine. 
In essence my proposal goes like this: The National Bank could issue their own block-chain fully run and controlled by the Bank, and allow free 1:1 exchange of the money they issue (say peso, euro or polish zloty) with coins in the public ledger, or vice-versa. 
The keys (wallets) could be generated offline, as they are today with Bitcoin. This is i think the tricky part, since they couldn't immediately identify who holds coins at any given time. Citizens would immediately get the benefits of completely digital payment system while retaining their privacy, **which i strongly believe is the basic right of every human being**. The Bank will surely be tempted to obtain the identity of every holder at any time, but the process of officially registering your keys would severely hamper the usability of digital money. It's not like i'm asking for anything that isn't possible today with physical cash, since the Bank today doesn't know the holders of every physical banknote either. By going digital the Bank would at least become aware of every transaction that has happened.
And obviously it would allow for completely transparent public and government organisations, since the people could freely inspect their accounts and money transfers. 
This scenario could potentially wipe Visa and Mastercard from the country, but i doubt anyone would bat an eyelid because of that fact. We on the other hand would gain instant and completely free transaction system.
The infrastructure required by the bank is minimal, since it's been tested that high performance PC today could easily cover up to 40000 transactions per second which is similiar to Visa and Mastercard's capabilities. 
I don't know the costs of maintaining the cash flow in Poland, however in EU it's been estimated to be at least 50 billion euro per year. 
I know, it probably will never work. It would require a Bank acting in good faith (nearly impossible) and a government that can do IT (absolutely impossible). However if done right it could greatly boost the value of national money and allow people to learn the immense usefullness of the block-chain.

Thanks, so Bitcoin isn't a true physical mesh network because for example when a node issues a transaction it has to rely on an existing network to carry this message and know where it needs to be sent?
I think now i get it. Jeff Garzik pointed out to me on Twitter that the Internet itself is a mesh network, i didn't consider it before because of the need for DNS making the structure sort-of centralised. The DNS servers just act as a digital road signs pointing out the way the packets of data needs to go, they don't physically transmit the data so it's still a physical mesh network that they're just an integral part of. Is that correct? :)
Edit: reply instead of replay and i'm not sure about DNS centralising the Internet.

This could never, ever happen, and even if it did it would be idiotic. Sorry. 
For this business model to work, your phone would need to actually generate that 10-15% of store stuff value. Even if 21 somehow made a chip that efficient, your gains would quickly dissolve between more chips as they enter the market. 
Besides, if your phone can generate that amount of money, why not just handle it to you directly? You're effectively now proposing to take cash from Bob, exchange it through a third party for a coupon, and then hand this coupon back to Bob so he can use it like cash. That's unnecessary.
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:06:05
I think they can handle that part if they run the mining rig for instance only when the device is charging. 
What i'm worried about is that the Bitcoin network couldn't (and imho shouldn't) sustain the constant stream of dust transactions those chips would generate.

I get your point completely. But you see, this thing goes the other way round as well: if someone is absolutely no good at something, how can he tell if his criticism is accurate or not? You'd have to actually gather some skills in the subject to be able to tell what it takes to be good at something. The result: People who know very little about something tend to have the strongest opinions and think they've grasped the issue better than anyone else, whereas it's opposite in well educated people. It's known as Krugger-Dunning effect in psychology. 
Could you provide a few examples of those flaws in bitcoin that you mentioned?
@_date: 2015-01-08 12:09:19
I'm not suggesting this phone is or was meant to be a competition for Android. :) I do enjoy the arms race to make better and more capable cheap phones very much. 
It does however make a lot of sense and have big potential imho. Those cheap Nokias still sell in hundreds of millions in developing countries. In those markets the factors like familiarity, reliability, ruggedness and above all battery life have much more importance than processor or screen resolution. 
Ericsson predicts that in 5 year 85% of our population (that's nearly 6 billion people) will have access to the Internet. The landscape is changing really quickly. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 11:54:56
Nokia is quoting 29-day battery life on their 215. 
I'm guessing much smaller and lower-res screen, pretty basic processor and very simple Operating System with only basic Internet capabilities are the factors in that. 
Modern smartphones really are powerhouses, there's a lot of computations constantly going on in the background, and much more powerful internals. 
You probably couldn't run more intensive applications (like YouTube) on 215, but basic text/imaging like Facebook are fine.  And that's quite enough to run a wallet. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 18:11:56
Then fuck it, because what he left behind is something most people thought wasn't even possible for 20 years. And it's out there already anyway, and i am damn certain in the next 10 years everyone with the access to the Internet will be using some form of the block chain technology, just as everyone today uses TCP/IP. Bitcoin may even end up failing, the block chain won't. 
Honestly Mark Karpeles is perhaps the last person in the world to be a candidate for Satoshi. His writing style and fluidity in English, the timezone, the software architecture, everything points against him.

Now we're talking. 
**Transaction time:** The common agreement is that after 6 blocks (about 1 hour) you can consider transaction as completely irreversible. In Visa they can be reversed up to a week after being done. It's a serious concern for online merchants. 
Instant confirmations are possible on a number of ways. It's just the question which solution will end up the most practical and widely used. Remember it's still very early days, like the Internet was in 1994. 
**Regarding transaction limit:** the actual numbers IIRC are 12 transactions/second limit for Bitcoin currently (it will be slowly raised, the question is how to do it best) and the capacity of Visa network is more like 40000 transactions/second, usually reached during black friday.
Actually it's been tested that the regular high-end desktop PC could easily and securely process more than 40 000 transactions per second on the Bitcoin network, which is quite something when you consider that Visa spends up to 40% of it's earnings on server farms that sustain 40000t/s capacity. 
**Regarding privacy of buying a dildo:** actually you'd probably more likely use cash to pay for that. And i'd say the bigger issue here is that you have to fill out forms and hand over your whole identity whenever you have to pay for anything over the Internet. 
**Regarding useless hashes:** For Bitcoin it's i think 150 mW/h globally at the moment. Compare that with the costs of digging, extracting, melting, transporting and storing of gold. Just because a certain metal have pretty good qualities as a store of value for us. And a fun fact: there's est. 100x more paper gold than physical gold circulating on the markets. 
**Fees:** For Bitcoin it's $0,03 whatever the size of transaction, for WU or PayPal it's for instance 7% from USA to Venezuela. That's why servers are much better than human institutions: they are much more trust-worthy (when they are in the for of block chains at least) and cheaper to run. 
Intermediaries are existing just because previously we couldn't figure how to do it any other way. The firms like PayPal, Western Union, Visa or MasterCard exist **for the sole purpose of allowing us to pay each other**, and they became very big institutions collecting huge fees just to exist. They don't make any product at all. 
TL;DR: Yes, we've heard all those arguments, they are of no real concern. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:26:22


Are we talking about torrents that are already in circulation? Then no. You'd break the checksum of your torrent by adding any code into it. Every node would reject it by default. 


With bitcoin you can collect and analyze data about people's money usage, in real-time as well. That's kind of a big deal given that in the "old" system you'd have to relay mostly on quarterly reports for macro data, and even those cannot be accurate up to every penny.
That's not everything, though. Big merchants could set up their own full nodes for added security, so that they could monitor and get alerted of any sheanigans going on. 
There are incentives aplenty, thank you.

An experiment to create something of limited supply on the Internet, which people could freely exchange between themselves without having to relay on any third party.
So far it's working. Bitcoin is running since 3rd jan 2009 and i'd say the fact that it's still there proves a major technological point about the underlying technology. 
Now - some people have their concerns if it will be able to scale to handle mainstream use. This has never been done before so we truly don't know yet at this point, but there are very promising solutions being worked out as we speak. One can point out that very similiar doubts were cast over the early Internet, and those issues were also sorted out eventually.
