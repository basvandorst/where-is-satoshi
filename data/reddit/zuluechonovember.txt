I don't really agree with their perspective, but their argument is that during a crisis they want to have a central authority to provide stability. They're not convinced a decentralized network of participants can provide stability in a crisis.
Regardless, my question is more about competition from a larger competitor that can enforce adoption. How likely is it for bitcoin to be pushed aside in favor of a crypto RussiaCoin / ChinaCoin, assuming those governments force/incentivize their citizens to use their own crypto currency?

But if they do launch cryptocurrencies with those features, what happens to the price of bitcoin?

Exactly! Some of us will stay true to bitcoin while everyone else could be forced / incentivized to migrate to a government backed cryptocurrency. But what happens to the price of bitcoin if this scenario plays out?

Interesting point...for one, they could use smart contracts + government crypto to automate many of the government functionality like taxation, contract enforcement etc. 
Another reason: bitcoin is truly a global currency. Even though it is inefficient compared to fiat, the benefits of a decentralized system of trust might outweigh its transactional inefficiencies. Thoughts?

I'm a HODLr, plenty of pros, but here is my list of downside scenarios:
Competition: Being first isn't always the best - plenty of alternative currencies can challenge bitcoin (e.g. Ethereum)
Regulation: If regulators step in too soon, they can hurt innovation
Adoption as a transactional medium could never happen: fees are high and price volatility isn't helping, which ends up reducing utility of bitcoin
Future hard forks are inevitable, and bring plenty of uncertainty with them (scaling is not easy)
51% attack is becoming more likely as bitcoin becomes more centralized due to high mining costs and influence from big miners.
Tail events like quantum computers cracking private keys, governments making it illegal
These are just a few...

ITS REAL! :)
