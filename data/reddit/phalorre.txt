A few hundred BTC on satoshi dice on a lazy Sunday afternoon, just to kill some time.

That's where I started. No ragrets. Careful, it can become an obsession...

No. Sometimes I clear my history because I'm paranoid. Other times I feel really open and want to share. It's probably not a completely healthy mental situation. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:56:22
Sort of. I don't comment much. But I also don't comment never, if that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:39:40
Sure. Consider it done.

Been hodling since $3. Never sold any without replacing. Won't ever sell any again most likely, no matter the price. Don't know how to stop hodling.

And we should start right now. My name is u/phalorre and I promise not to pick any fights with another bitcoiner unless they are really, *really*, wrong.

I just don't know when that time would be. And if I jumped off the train, my life would still be consumed with watching the bitcoin price, dreading that it will go above the price I sold at.

Yeah, those were crazy times. Mt. Gox was pretty much the only game in town. Also, there was much less community in-fighting.  
  
Luckily for me, I was actually *late* enough to hear stories from the *super* old guard who talked about getting like 50,000 coins for $1,000 and then selling it all for $5,000 3 months later and how much regret they lived with.  
  
I hodl bitcoin now and forever because I fear deeply that kind of regret. I don't mind if bitcoin goes to zero (OK, I would), but I'd probably kill myself if I sold all my BTC and then it went to the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:53:51
Sure thing. All set.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:53:43
OK, done.

I typically introduce people to bitcoin using breadwallet. It's known for being easy to use and highly secure.

Dude, what's with the disrespect? Have you provided a solid, FREE, app to the bitcoin community? How can you accuse these guys (I assume they are all guys, there might be gals too) of not caring about the spirit and purpose of bitcoin? This whole sub-reddit has got an attitude problem lately and I think you should be ashamed for the way you're speaking to people who have put WAY more blood, sweat, and tears into this industry than you have. They've already said they will give you a way to follow the original bitcoin chain. What more do you want? Some kind of chest-beating about attackers at the gates? I like the breadwallet guys because they keep their heads down and they keep building product. I just hope they don't get lose their enthusiasm for it because of comments like yours.

It can be. Generate a phrase on breadwallet. Write the phrase down and keep it in a safe place. Transfer funds to breadwallet. Wipe the wallet.  
  
If you ever need to recover your funds, just take the piece of paper with your passphrase and enter it into breadwallet again.

If you do a bit of thinking, and maybe play around with anagrams (hint), you can figure out who at least one of them is.
