Seems to me like he's buying comments more than votes.
@_date: 2016-11-07 02:10:28
That doesn't make any sense. Is the technology good or not? That's all we have to care about.
Morals... lol ... funny guy Roger Ver.

Whether these examples are true, false or somewhere in between is not really the point of the article.
What about that BU placebo controls? Are THOSE true?
@_date: 2016-12-07 01:30:51
Nice try...
@_date: 2016-11-26 12:56:02
Good point.

I get paid 2 dogecoins for every upvote and 5 dogecoins for every comment in line with the message of my masters. It's hard work but we will succeed in bringing down the world... one upvote at a time!

I have the same post rate limit there (1 post per 10 min). It is because you have been mostly downvoted in that sub.
The only way to eliminate the rate limit is to be 'whitelisted' by the mods. But don't get your hopes up. I have asked for myself and they told me it's only for 'well known bitcoin personalities'. Not sure if you fall in that category...

"I'm agnostic about SegWit, but I will finance a smear campaign against it."
-Roger Ver
You missed an important one.
@_date: 2016-12-07 12:35:35
No no you got me wrong. I don't care about the downvotes at all. Just explaining to him that it is possible to have bad karma and not be a troll.
I'm sure it must suck to be banned...

First sentence: 


Lol. The emotional bias in the article is a too clear for my liking... Even though I agree with everything there.
@_date: 2016-11-12 03:44:35
We are grateful for your tireless work over there.
@_date: 2016-11-12 03:40:05
-3? That's not bad
Simply write the following post in r/btc: "SegWit is a horrible solution for a simple problem. Just change a simple digit goddamnit! This is what Satoshi wanted"
This should give you enough good karma for a week. That is how r/btc works.
@_date: 2016-12-08 02:50:29
Nice message. I endorse.
@_date: 2016-11-29 00:41:33
That doesn't add much to the conversation. Are you at least going to day what you don't agree with?
@_date: 2016-11-11 15:50:41
Yes, that would be great, but I don't think the mods share your opinion on that.
@_date: 2016-11-25 20:33:11
Yes, I also thought he was acting in good faith at one point.
But when he makes deceptive comments like this one:
You see that he's simply politician. Misrepresentation is his middle name.
@_date: 2016-12-04 20:02:09
I thought it was funny. 
@_date: 2016-11-12 03:24:09
3 conditions need to be met in order for it to become a real success in r/btc:
- A core dev most come and point out obvious flaws with the method that would make it unsustainable for the network.
- An r/btc oracle (Ver, Garzik and al.) needs to come out and say that he thought about it in 2010 and that it is the only way to make bitcoin survive the impending altcoin threat.
- A group of improvised devs need to produce a new version of protocol in two weeks and give it a real catchy name, like "bitcoin infiniti".

Very interesting. Nicely done video!

From what I understand, you can vote on his site with a bitcoin address. The weight of your vote is proportional to the # of bitcoins you have in that address.
We don't know who voted....
@_date: 2016-11-22 01:24:52
I had no idea about that difference between "type 2" and "type 3" hardforks. Really interesting. Thanks
@_date: 2016-12-07 01:29:13
You were banned from there? Is that even possible?
@_date: 2016-11-03 01:03:33
That "mining heater" is all good and well... but I'm pretty sure the payback time on investment will be... never. 
If you consider the first cost, maintenance and short lifecycle on that thing. And especially considering how a standard electrical baseboard is so cheap compared to a highly technical item like this one.
Unfortunately, I'm skeptical about that idea having any chance of being commercially viable. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 01:27:43
Try being a 'contrarian' in rbtc for example... see what happens.
I'm personally having difficulty staying in the positive karma. I don't think I'm a troll either...
@_date: 2016-10-24 00:57:18
You're implying that the 30 minute talk about on-chain scaling given to 100-200 people was so incredibly moving ... that people all over China and the world were inspired to buy at the exact same time huge amounts of btc and shot up the price. Bitcoin Jesus himself descended from the skies with his golden aura to sing the praise of bigger blocks to the world.
No... I think you have no idea why the btc price moved... like the rest of us. Stop telling yourself stories.

Until it's official, what you are saying isn't worth much.
@_date: 2016-10-27 00:41:17
Good post, I agree 100%.
@_date: 2016-10-25 18:30:59
So I guess this is the official release?
@_date: 2016-10-24 15:28:24
I stand corrected. I am surprised too.
@_date: 2016-10-24 00:40:18
Are you something in China?
@_date: 2016-10-24 14:55:34
AA might sometimes be overly optimistic. But I have to say I agree 100% with him on that one.
But try posting this on rbtc.... I don't expect much success.
@_date: 2016-10-24 15:07:50


Nice link, thanks.
@_date: 2016-10-24 01:09:22
I think i heard that one already. It's getting old.
