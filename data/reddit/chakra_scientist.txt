It's 45 days from being published in the Federal Register. It was published on Thursday, July 14, 2016.
August 28th is the 45th day. So they will likely give a yes/no or file an extension within the next 7 days.
But, even with a yes answer, it does not indicate final approval. They will still need to get final permission from the SEC to go live. But a yes answer greatly improves their chances of going live.

Alot of things, global stock markets at all time highs when historically we've seen recessions every 7-8 years. The political drama going on now, I honestly think something big is about to pop off. The dollar has been tanking. Look what happened in that big Saudi corruption scandal. Let's just say shit hits the fan, then there is going to be alot of worthless currency looking for safe havens.
It may sound a bit cynical, because everything is good right now, but it won't always be this way. Noting how stable Bitcoin has been, how reliable, no downtime, and the strong economic security behind the token BTC, it's probably one of the best things to hold during a global economic crisis when everything else is made up of hot air.

I wouldn't waste money on school and a bachelors degree. Some people may see the value, but I just see them as businesses making alot of money from selling their customers some dreams. As crazy as it sounds, you can be whatever you want, and do whatever you're passionate about, without a degree. 
Some of the best healers I know don't have medical degrees, the best architects are great at CAD and never went to architecture school. There are great legal advisors that aren't lawyers, that understand regulations and know how to navigate around them.
Degrees don't measure skill, nor are they a prerequisite to pursue your dreams.

Deal with it for the time being.
You want to keep increasing the block size every time there is some congestion? 
You want 8mb blocks which equates to 400gb a year, where most laptops only have 500gb space?
Ask most hodlors who made money from Bitcoin. People are in it to hold it, not to transact with it on the daily. It's been known from the beginning that Bitcoin is a terrible payment system. 
A transaction cache layer is absolutely needed for people who want to transact. It's coming... you need to be patient.

It has nothing to do with the stress test, the transaction was never propagated to the network correctly. It's not a rare occurrence.

Mostly because Coinbase CEO is pushing things people don't support, even Coinbase's own employees don't support what he is pushing for.
BArmstrong/Coinbase has not contributed much to Bitcoin scalability, yet the roadmap that Bitcoin Core (Bitcoin's top scalability and implementation development community) is being undermined or discredited (by saying it's not progressing) by him.
Majority of the industry is rejecting BIP101, yet Coinbase is still trying to push it on everyone.

That's not the point.

They actually released it late. In February, they said they were going to release it in a month or two. So no, it has nothing to do with the blocksize debate.

That's wrong on so many levels. Let me start.
1. How are people supposed to support something before it has has a champion promoting it?
A: Well, Segregated Witness is pretty much ACK'd by majority of developers. It allows Bitcoin to increase the number of transactions per block.
2. Gavin and Brian are heroes in my opinion.
A: How so? Bitcoin's decentralization is barely anything now-a-days. And BIP101 is decreasing it further. The only reason Bitcoin has any value at all, is because of it's decentralization. By increasing block size, decreasing node count is a side effect, which discourages decentralization.
3. Core is betting the future of Bitcoin on untested technology and censoring anyone who disagrees. It's deplorable.
A: Core is not doing any censoring at all..

I think their reasoning behind "blockchain can exist without bitcoin" is this:
Bitcoin's are needed to incentivize people to mine. Currently, Bitcoin mining is already heavily centralized.
If Goldman Sachs creates a blockchain, it will be centrally mined, and the token won't be necessary.
But then, this wouldn't be decentralized. Not that Goldman would ever run a decentralized chain anyways. 
For decentralization, the token is needed. Anyone who says otherwise is not building a decentralized ledger.

To be honest, these guys can blow bitcoin's ass out of the water. If there was ever a real competitor to Bitcoin, this is it.

Hard forks only get consensus if a wild bug, or something happens that forks the blockchain in a unforseen way.
Otherwise, soft forks are how majority of new changes will be made. Even for new features, it's difficult to get consensus for hard forks.

FYI: To calculate BTC volume.
Take turnover, divide by price. So you get shares traded number. Multiply that number by 0.005
Example: 6,120,559 / 10.15 = 603010.73 Shares volume
603010.73 x 0.005 = 3015 btc volume

There is pretty much a guarantee that more users = higher prices. You can bet on that. If you think Bitcoin's userbase will continue to grow, it doesn't really matter if you bought during a gap of $20-$30, because the price will still go up in the future. Given a larger userbase. 
Yeah theres no guarantee in anything, but lets be realistic here.

Mining pools are the real problem here. If blacklists do happen, governments will force mining pool operators to uphold those blacklists. 
If mining continues to be more and more centralized, and 5-10 pool operators own majority of the hash rate, than blacklists can be very easy to implement. 
Thats why decentralization of mining is so important, and if anything kills Bitcoin or fungibility, it will be the mining pools.

I don't understand how you can say XCP is not an altcoin. Maybe not in the truest sense, since it doesn't have mining etc. But Counterparty uses a currency (XCP, which is not btc) to carry out it's functionality. That's like saying ETHER or Mastercoin is not an altcoin.... They are.
It's in the interest of many people to have a financial platform on Bitcoin network that gives value to the bitcoin currency vs a competing currency.

Yeah. Use cases vary alot. But you can peg assets to the value of other assets.
Also counterparty works as a decentralized stock market.
There is a inbuilt distributed exchange to buy/sell xcp, as well as other assets. So if I create a share for my company, I can trade that share for a asset representing a gold coin.

Sounds like a honeypot, specifically using the word launder, so they can bite you in the ass once regulations are in place.
"This guy used the launder feature on our website... Throw him in the cage!"
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:44:12
Heres a good way to do it:
Go to the bulk tab, generate 3 rows. Copy all of that. Open wordpad, paste the 3 rows. Make everything 1 line (eliminate all the spaces and returns), so you get a huge line of random numbers and letters. Now change some of those letters and numbers.
Copy that huge line, and paste it into the brain wallet tab on bitaddress.
This will create a private key, and address based on the long string you entered. 
This is the most secure way to do it. People tend to think because your disconnected your safe, thats not true. The correct way to use bitaddress is to create your own passphrases, and see the private keys it spits out.

Mixing is a double edge sword. Hypothetically speaking, since bitcoin is money, you can send coins from coinbase to a mixer, but then the individual can be accused of money laundering.
Lets say someone send coins from Coinbase --&gt; new address --&gt; mixer --&gt; back to coinbase, they can say this is laundered money.
Until the day comes where Bitcoin's can be mixed in a way you can't tell they were mixed, there will never be true fungibility.

Mastercoin was a really well thought out scam. They got thousands of BTC invested. Everyone knew it was failing like 6 months in, and then they used MaidSafe to pretty much make liquidity for all the big guys to cash out. They ruined MaidSafe and Mastercoin is pretty much a fail.
Thats why it takes 1 year for Mastercoin to develop features, and Counterparty has all the same features and more in like their first month of development.
Take everyones money, put on a front for development, create liquidity, get out.

NXT is great, but having 100% of the currency distributed to 70 people will hinder adoption. It's distribution was its weakness from the start. Ethereum can also do everything NXT does, and hopefully its launch will be more fairly distributed. I believe the initial IPO was cut off early as well.

Looking further at propagation, you can also try importing that private key into a different wallet (local works best) and resending the transaction. The balance should still be there.
I do not think it was broadcasted properly.
Next time, it's best to completely empty out the address. As you can see, you left a very small balance in the address. So you don't have to create unnecessary outputs.

So the question is, how much BTC do you think MtGox lost? And will they be able to buy it with their profits to complete all withdrawals?
If I understand correctly, the attackers were doing withdrawals, doing the malleability exploit, and MtGox's system was automatically processing another withdrawal. Multiple withdrawals may have been completed under different transaction ids, and MtGox's automated system was thinking none of the withdrawals were going through.

Major retailers accepting = selling pressure because they are converting into fiat. This doesn't really bring new users in, it actually lets existing users cash out. I am saying that with new users entering the bitcoin space, the price goes up accordingly. 
My argument is that if the OP thinks Bitcoin's userbase will grow, so will the price. 
I'm not expecting it to grow 10x or 100x, I am saying it does grow with more users. The past few days, with the FUD going around, isn't going to break bitcoin. In fact, I am actually happy that this is happening, because it allows people to see bugs and fix them. 
This FUD won't be around forever, and when peoples confidence is reassured, new users will start to come in again, thus increasing the price.

If blocks are 2mb, and there is 0.9 mb of legit transactions, the attacker only needs to set fees to minimum to fill the 1.1mb of empty block space.
Meaning 1.1mb of $0.04 minerfee transactions.
Legitimate transactions aren't even filling 1mb blocks yet.

@_date: 2016-03-01 16:24:09
Wheeler, no need to get sarcastic. 
Low miner fee transactions (lets say 0.04) can still fill that 1.1mb space. Without a 11x higher cost. 
It doesn't raise the cost by 11x. The cost stays at 0.04 per transaction, not 0.44. 
If 2mb blocks are filled with 0.9mb of legit, and need 1.1mb of spam, 1.1mb of spam is roughly 4782.60 tx (lets use 230bytes per tx). 4782.6 x 0.04 = $191.3 cost of minerfees to fill 1.1mb of empty block space.
So 7.1mb of spam 30,869 transactions. Using the same fee of $0.04 to fill up empty block space. 30869 x $0.04 = $1234.76 cost of minerfees to fill 7.1mb of empty block space.
2mb vs 8mb at 0.9mb legit transactions, costs roughly only 6.5x more, not 77x more.

That is the truth. I certainly don't like being demonized or accused of "censoring" when that was not my intention.
**Mods have the option to reapprove removed threads. The fact that I submitted this should be concrete evidence that it was done with no malintent. Certainly not because "you kicked up a fuss". Otherwise I would have just left the original submission live after I removed it.** But I removed it and reposted it because it was not able to be seen in the new section. I don't care about the karma either...
It's definitely not a good feeling being accused of malintent when your intention was a good one. 
Jumping to conclusions and yelling censorship accusations isn't warranted either.
Anyways, I accept your apology (if your OP reflects that), it was just a misunderstanding and bad moderating time on my part. For the person who tells others not to assume bad faith, we sure don't get the same treatment around here. Disconnecting for a little while.

Blockstream? You don't like them for having an opinion? Segwit is a solution to more capacity, but more importantly it's a solution to maleability problem. Alot of people are blindly blaming Blockstream, but in reality, Blockstream is doing the most important development work out of any other company in this space. Hands down. Blockstream hate is really unwarranted. It's mostly the blind following the blind. Look at some of the things they are funding: Lightning, elements project, sidechains. Blockstream is actually the ONLY company doing work on the privacy/fungibility problem. Who else is doing protocol development like this?

In one of his final moves as New York’s top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky will soon unveil a set of new licensing rules that could have long-lasting effects on businesses using bitcoin and other virtual currencies.
In doing so, bitcoin advocates fear Mr. Lawsky will cement his reputation for taking tough stands against the financial industry.
Mr. Lawsky, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, said those fears are overblown and that his goal for the so-called BitLicense is to find the appropriate balance between protecting consumers and carving out enough freedom for developers to build new products with what he has called this “promising technology.”
Mr. Lawsky said on Wednesday that he will depart the New York Department of Financial Services in June to form a consulting business that will include virtual-currency advisory services.
The pending launch of the BitLicense comes amid a backdrop in which an increasing number of Wall Street institutions are exploring ways to adopt the blockchain ledger technology that runs bitcoin and other virtual currencies.
Some people in the nascent industry worry Mr. Lawsky’s rules, likely to be released next week, could hinder innovation among small tech start-ups with limited resources.

In the interview, which took place before Wednesday’s announcement of his resignation, Mr. Lawsky said the most-recent draft of the BitLicense already provided sufficient exemptions and protections for software developers.
“There is nothing worse for a business person than not having clarity, so we intend to be as clear as possible,” Mr. Lawsky said. “If it’s not clear enough, we will give examples. And if it’s still not clear enough, we will give more examples.”
Mr. Lawsky plans to stay at the agency until late June. An NYDFS spokesman said details of the license wouldn’t be affected by Mr. Lawsky’s departure.
Last month, leaders from some of the biggest bitcoin companies, investment firms and advocacy groups gathered in New York to hash out a list of concerns and draw the NYDFS’s attention to them.
Their concerns are amplified by expectations that this first-of-a-kind license will be a template for other states. Some state regulators are already applying existing money transmitter rules to virtual-currency businesses but many are expected to follow the lead of the country’s most important financial hub and set specific new rules for the sector.
Still, some industry leaders argue that New York risks “becoming the bitcoin backwater of the U.S.,” as MIT Digital Currency Initiative Director Brian Forde put it in a blog post that summed up the New York meeting’s recommendations.
In making such criticisms, bitcoin business leaders “are fighting for the rights of companies that do not yet exist,” said Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of bitcoin exchange and consumer service provider Coinbase, who organized the New York meeting. He argues that the established bitcoin industry, including well-funded firms like his, benefits if startups are free to continue the sector’s hectic pace of innovation.

During the New York meeting, Mr. Ehrsam estimated it would cost Coinbase $2 million to fulfill all its licensing requirements around the country. In response, Fred Wilson, a partner at New York-based Union Partners, described such costs as a huge barrier to entry that encouraged venture-capital firms like his to concentrate on established players that were already well down that compliance path.
Bitcoin advocates were happy when a second BitLicense draft that was released in February rolled back stricter regulatory constraints contained in the first draft published in July. However, they continued to harbor specific concerns.
The bitcoin business leaders complained that the BitLicense’s anti-money-laundering provisions, as written in the February draft, could unfairly apply to all developers of so-called wallets, which are software applications that give people direct control over their bitcoins, whereas controls should only be imposed on those services with custody of customers’ bitcoins and dollars. The group also said the draft’s rule requiring NYDFS approval of updates to a provider’s software was impractical in an industry that makes product changes weekly.
Mr. Lawsky said such concerns were misplaced. “We make it crystal clear that we are not going to regulate software providers or software creators or people doing code. The MIT student has nothing to worry about,” he said. “We are only regulating financial intermediaries.”
    ‘We make it crystal clear that we are not going to regulate software providers or software creators or people doing code.’
    —Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services. 
On software updates, he said, “We have no interest if they make an update to their code in having them every time get approval for that. It is about when you’re fundamentally changing what you are doing in a material way.”
Mr. Lawsky also played down industry concerns that the rules would require some providers to apply for both a traditional money-transmission license and a new BitLicense. Describing this as a quirk of New York law, he said “you will be able to file just one application for both and you will be able to cross-satisfy so that even in those duplication cases you don’t have to do the paperwork twice.”
He also vowed to work with other states so that prior NYDFS approval of shareholder structure changes and other reporting requirements could help expedite approvals in those jurisdictions. “We have done a lot of work and hopefully we will be able to have some influence” over other state regulators, Mr. Lawsky said.
The BitLicense comes as interest grows on Wall Street in new applications for virtual currencies’ blockchain ledger technology. In the past month, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. invested in bitcoin consumer services company Circle Internet Financial, Nasdaq OMX Group announced a test of a new securities transfer system that would exploit the bitcoin blockchain’s real-time settlement capability and the New York Stock Exchange launched a new bitcoin price index.

Bitcoin Classic's argument is that they want alternate implementations, we'll that's fine. They can have those.  But what is their justification for a hardfork, when the softfork is much safer, and achieves the same goals. A little more code complexity is well worth the security you get by soft forks. We need to ask ourselves what is the main goal of this fork, it's not alternate implementations. It's consensus control.

It's a seperate, competing, and hostile project to Bitcoin Core. They've repeatedly insulted Core devs, and now they want collaboration to review their code? What incentive does Core have to review/test Classic's code? They made their bed, now they sleep in it. It's lose-lose with that community. If you do, you're damned. If you don't, you're damned.
Everything they do is non-organic, based on spending money. Whether it's advertising Classic, buying up fake nodes to inflate node count, even when it comes to buying manipulation bots to use on this subreddit, or pushing the sky-is-falling panic to influence support. If the Classic movement was organic, maybe they could get some allstar devs to do their own testing. Or pay some Core devs to do it for them, but don't expect it for free.
My opinion.

No, decentralization &gt; price
I currently run a full node. In 4 days, I used about 65gb of upload bandwidth. Increasing block size to 2mb, will do a few things:
1. Decrease full nodes.
2. Increase costs of those running full nodes x2
3. Plus, the additional bandwidth requirements from the decrease in full nodes.
Then, in 2 years, after block size is 4mb, it will happen again. Effectively pushing all full nodes into data centers due to bandwidth requirements.
If we can compress 2mb worth of transactions, into a 1mb block. Why are you complaining about it? It's effectively the same thing.
If social consensus is needed, then try to achieve it. Posting on reddit complaining that Core needs to get social consensus, and not doing anything about it, is useless. Have you forgotten that this list of people is comprised of volunteers? You run a business, put some of your resources into achieving social consensus.

It's not _only_ Greg's plan, it's the plan of majority of Bitcoin developers.
Alot of Bitcoin users are pretty dumb to be honest. "oh my god I won't be able to use Bitcoin if 1mb doesn't turn to 2mb" Then when 2mb gets stress tested, Gavin and Brian are going to run out again and say "omg the block size needs to be increased". I don't buy this false scare tactics one bit. Bitcoin is working fine right now, Segwit is around the corner, increases block size by 70%, payment channels are around the corner, bitcoin has NOT hit capacity yet, and still centralization pushers want to double the amount of bandwidth for full nodes essentially pushing them to VPS's = data centers.
Truth is, from a speculation standpoint, the value of BTC goes up the more decentralized it is. Gavin and company are misleading when they say Classic is about alternate implementations. We already have 5 or 6 different implementations. Core is the most popular because of developer network effects and having the best devs. Classic might think they "decentralized development" but really they are piggy backing future work from Core. I think its very rude how Classic just did the community a disservice by spitting on the face of devs who have successfully carried Bitcoin this far without any major problems.
2mb is unnecessarily adding more centralization pressure, trying to fix a problem that doesn't exist (full blocks). 1 week average, blocks are still below .75mb, 7 years into the project. Instead Classic wants to hardfork now, and can't even wait 3 months? **The hard fork makes no sense, especially if it doesn't introduce a flex cap.** We have capacity increases right around the corner, but Gavin and company still want to double the amount of bandwidth full nodes need. Pushing them to VPS's only..
Don't support Classic.

No because the miners which are signalling for BU are actually running Core. Otherwise, they would have lost alot of money. 
Jihan Wu (miner running BU) only signals for BU to block a malleability fix Core has pending, but in reality he is running Core for it's stability.

Whose arguing against a dynamic limit? Blockstream's own, Mark Friedenbach has a flex cap proposal.

I used to be a moderator on this subreddit. 
The main reason why I resigned was because I started browsing this subreddit less, mainly due to a busier schedule, but also because every single Bitcoin-related subreddit is being plagued by this "debate". I had a good idea to start but never really put the time into it.
Believe me, the work that the mods do in this subreddit is incredible. They get a lot of crap for "moderating" and other individuals will be screaming censorship like little kids. But it's really necessary. In the beginning it started as moderating contentious hard fork attempts like Bitcoin XT/Classic (dead), but then the promoters of those two forks really started paid slander campaign against this subreddit and did more damage to this community than moderation did. Much of it is misinformation, and every time the mods delete these fud posts crying about censorship, it encourages people in rbtc to just scream about it more. 
I agree this subreddit shouldn't be a echochamber, but there is a huge amount of manipulation going on in all the bitcoin subreddits. I forgot what the proper word is, but readers should really do their "due diligence" and see through the bias when reading anything about Bitcoin on Reddit.. Both subreddits transformed into echo-chambers, and there are paid shills posting everywhere.
@_date: 2016-03-25 20:16:57
But what they're pushing for is not a dynamic limit.
They are pushing for 2mb. Which stirred up all of this drama, for maybe a 2-3 month fix. And people rejected it, because 2mb hard fork is not worth it. A flex cap hard fork is worth it.

Bandwidth is the issue. I can't even run a full node with open connections with 30 mbps/1.5mbps because then noone else in my house can do anything on the internet. This is one of the reasons we need to be conservative with the block size. At least until global internet speeds increase enough to handle the bandwidth for full nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:29:32
There is some truth, but it seems like a paid shill posting. 
Roger Ver has been paying people to post bad stuff about Blockstream, Bitcoin Core, and Core developers. 
So it's good to see the bias there.
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:11:20
At least it's not the 13th
@_date: 2016-01-26 20:32:30
Would you rather have:
1. BTC with low block size, and majority of transactions having on a secure decentralized layer of payment channels. The benefit is, when global internet speeds increase, running a full node is just as easy as running a background application with low bandwidth requirements. This will increase decentralization in the future. Transactions still get done, and Bitcoin still functions.
2. Have large blocks, and keep increasing block size every time blocks start getting full. Eliminating the primary use of payment channels and fee market. High bandwidth usage, so only individuals with high bandwidth can run a full node. Transactions still get done, and Bitcoin still functions.
I'd rather have a Bitcoin with low resource usage for a full node, that way when bandwidth and internet speeds increase, running a full node is just the same as running Dropbox sync application in the background. Also increases decentralization of the network. Keeping resource usage of a full node to a minimum is great, it increases decentralization and will bring more nodes online when Bitcoin has more users. Regularly increasing block size every time blocks get full just pushes all the nodes to data centers, since they are the only ones with enough bandwidth to run a full node.
No matter which you use, you will still be able to make transactions on the Bitcoin network. I think, if there was any way to kill Bitcoin, it'd be through splitting the community and reducing decentralization. Decentralization is the branch that Bitcoin is hanging by. We should try everything possible to scale Bitcoin without reducing decentralization. Reducing decentralization should be a last option.

Don't think for a second, or give others the idea, that I posted this because you "started yelling about it".
Mods have the option to reapprove removed threads. The fact that I submitted this should be concrete evidence that it was done with no malintent. Certainly not because you started yelling about it. Otherwise I would have just reapproved the original submission live after I removed it. But I removed it and reposted it because it was not able to be seen in the new submissions section. I don't care about the karma either...
I think the reason you were getting upset is because your over exaggerated censorship posts were being deleted at the time. And rightfully so, while I was in the process of reposting.

If Uphold gives you the transaction id, you can check for 1 confirmation (normally about 10 minutes).

I think so. Developing a multi-billion dollar decentralized network is hard work. Minor bugs that break consensus can be very costly for the ecosystem. They take their time testing very seriously, which is a good thing.
I think all the developers have done a fine job of keeping the network running smoothly. I read the bitcoin core meeting logs every week, it's nice to see how their work flows.
@_date: 2016-01-18 04:58:23

No it doesn't include increasing max block size. Maybe you don't know how segwit works.
If average blocksize over a course of a week or two hits max segwit levels, then we should consider it. Until then, we should use what we have, and not try to go overkill. Even right now, average block size is about 750kb. We still have a year or so until average block size hits 1mb, by that time segwit will be rolled out. No need to jump the gun. All this panic is unnecessary, my transactions with a 0.0001 always get confirmed fast. And if blocks are full, I use 0.0002

Good chance they will fork off btc. There's no point in forking from a existing fork instead of the main valid chain. It's been almost a month of transactions now on the main chain, and there would be many problems from anyone who received BTC after August 1 if they forked off of BCH.

Physical delivery is a term used in financial markets meaning taking custody of the asset. When the asset traded has been transferred from one counterparty to the other.
Aka not cash settled, because many futures markets only settle in USD, physically settled means it's done in BTC of actually conducting a onchain transaction to finalize the delivery.

I don't think it will ever reach $250k, I think it might reach $100k
Reasons being, I think supply shocks are a issue. Without constant mining reward subsidy, reliance on transaction fees to pay for security won't work out that well. Especially after like 2-3 halvings from now.
Privacy is huge, Bitcoin network has 0 privacy, and options like Wasabi are expensive (0.1 minimum), and wallets like Samurai etc do a decent job at privacy but still it should be baked into the protocol.
I think theres too much "Bitcoin is gonna be great and take over the world and citadels and only btc forever" and not enough healthy skepticism around problems we know exist.
Also, every layer 2 protocol which was developed on Bitcoin has failed to gain any significant usage. Counterparty and Mastercoin were of the first that let you issue assets on Bitcoin network, both failed. Well technically Mastercoin rebranded to Omni but now that Tether is using different chains, it's also a little obsolete. RSK was super hyped, never really took off because it doesn't have a decentralized 2wp. Liquid was promoted so much, you hardly ever see more than 2-3 transactions on that blockchain. Lightning Network has significant development and time will tell how much mainstream adoption it gets, but once transaction fees replace mining subsidy, it's going to be very pricey to open and close channels and do coinjoins too. 
People think Bitcoin invented digital currency, but it's been a constant evolution the past 20 years or so that i've witnessed it. People thought egold was awesome, people thought liberty reserve was awesome, people thought WoW gold and MMORPG digital currencies were awesome, then Bitcoin came out and changed the whole game because it was decentralized, but I think we will continue to see the evolution of the digital currency industry for many years in the future and I am not willing to bet that Bitcoin will win that race.
At the moment, it's the best we have, but I don't think it's going to remain this way forever.
So yeah, that's why I don't think Bitcoin will reach $250k, I'm not betting against it though, I just think the digital currency industry and the free market will provide superior solutions that solve these issues and I don't believe it will be based on the Bitcoin blockchain as we know it.

That was a good interview, solid points from everyone. Makes me bullish on October's decision. I'm already so bored of the ETF news for years, but if approved, it will definitely have an effect on GBTC's premium.
Although, the argument that there is a huge portion of wealth in the US that hasn't had exposure to btc is false I think. Everyone who has wanted exposure can get it, just maybe not in the vehicle type they wanted (etf, fund, physically settled btc, etc) but it's definitely been available. It will make it alot easier though, with very low premiums to buy cash settled btc.

There's some things which stick out to me as a Bitcoiner.
* Although this bank was/is regulated by the government, this scandal was uncovered by a whistleblower and completely bypassed regulation. Meaning, the same regulation that government touts as ways to protect the citizens, is completely ineffective.
* PMC Bank account holders have funds blocked. Now, many of these folks were using this banking service as a way to store their savings. If these users used Bitcoin instead, they would not have their money taken.
* How many scandals will it take for people to see that banks commit more fraud than anyone? When Wells Fargo was discovered to have been creating fake accounts, nobody even went to jail. At least in this case, the chairmans were arrested for fraud after creating tons of shell accounts under false names.
Although bitcoin is volatile, it is much safer to store wealth, than in traditional banking systems. As this event has proven.

There are many solutions for scaling being developed, and tested, but for some reason Mike really wants to sidestep this and jump straight to bigger blocks. Worst, divide the community.
It would be different if 1mb blocks were being filled constantly, but Bitcoin is using 1mb blocks now and its working fine. There would be much more consensus if this was actually a problem. On the true Bitcoin network, I bet scalability issue will be resolved before 1mb blocks are being filled constantly.

Hi Bobby, I've enjoyed watching your talks on YouTube.
Bitcoin is a evolving protocol. The numerous developers/testers/contributors of the main reference implementation, Bitcoin Core, have done a great job in building new features, and increasing low level scalability. Most importantly, in a organized, consensus-based, well-tested manner.
BTCC is currently signalling for Segwit2x, a incompatible hard fork which a overwhelming majority of all ecosystem developers are against. Why are you signalling for Segwit2x?
I like BTCC very much, but every day your pool is signalling Segwit2x, it shows arrogance of not being a responsible company in this space.
My question is, do you have any plans to stop signalling for Segwit2x?

Payment channels is the layer 2 on top of bitcoin. People were always talking that Bitcoin protocol is the first layer. 
Layer 2 provides all the scalability needed FOR PAYMENTS right now, and it provides enough security. For large important transactions, it makes sense to pay a higher fee to put it in the blockchain. But for regular payments (which is probably 75%+ of transactions right now), payment channels are a good way to get your transaction confirmed instantly, with good security.
It should be in everyones interest to keep the blockchain small and decentralized. Especially when payment channels (layer 2, lightning network) can handle most payments the average joe wants to make: instantly, securely, and without adding it to the blockchain. The blockchain is a good settlement network, but a bad micropayment network. The Cost per Transaction (mining cost, not transaction fee) right now is $10.48, much better to use payment channels and keep it down.
Disclaimer: I know payment channels aren't 100% live yet, but I don't think there are any major flaws in the design.

There should be a homepage, that OB1 controls. That way, when you load in, you don't see a bunch of random products. You see a well designed homepage.
OB1 can make revenue off of it, and it will make the user experience much better.
Yeah, it introduces more power for OB1, but at least you load into a well designed page instead of a bunch of random products.

"even if we ignore the fact that trying to acquire that amount on-market would skyrocket the price."
Noone would buy on market. They would use dark pools and other forms of liquidity.
DigitalBTC purchased 10.1m of BTC this year, and the price didn't "skyrocket". Accumulating 100k isn't that difficult. Assuming they paid max $300 per coin, thats 33k btc right there, in 1 quarter.

In the post, he mentions:
"The growth rate of 17.7% growth per year is consistent with the average growth rate of bandwidth the last years, which seems to be the bottleneck. If over time, this growth factor is beyond what the actual technology offers, the intention should be to soft fork a tighter limit. "
But what if actual technology outpaces the growth factor of 17.7%? Would we have to hard fork again? I think we are going to make a huge jump in the next 3-5 years with many more cities introducing gigabit speeds.

From the whitepaper:
"Fully trusted and third-party-free two-way pegs can be created using smart-contracts on both platforms. But since Bitcoin does not currently support smart-contracts nor native opcodes to validate external SPV proofs, part of the two-way pegging system in RSK requires trust on a set of a semi-trusted third-parties (STTP). No single STTP can control the locked BTCs, but only a majority of them has the ability to release BTC funds. The STTPs temporarily store the BTC that are locked, and unlocks BTC to pay Bitcoin users RTC are locked in RSK to be transferred back to Bitcoin."

A hard fork is when the network splits into 2 different forks, either unintentionally, or intentionally. Refer to 2013 which was a unintentional fork, which was quickly corrected. 
A contentious hard fork is when there is a proposal/fork which is not widely agreed upon. It may change some fundamentals of Bitcoin which is why it's very controversial.

Here you don't see many posts complaining about Classic. There on the other hand, majority of the posts/comments are complaining about Core or Blockstream. 
Even the biggest promoters, talk about competing implementations. Ironically, all they try to do is insult/"depracate" Core instead of doing high quality development work and organically attracting devs. This is how they plan on competing with Core?

Use the visual representation of key players to begin whatever campaign has been established. If the moderators are on to your shilling, claim CENSORSHIP!! loudly and often, try to migrate users to a new hub or sub, and continue fighting to get back on.

Here is what I want in Bitcoin:
**Nodes:** I want nodes to be extremely light and not resource intensive. Like running a lightweight sync program in the background that you hardly notice. This way, when global bandwidth speeds increase, more people can easily run full nodes on their home computer, instead of renting VPS's in a datacenter (like many do now). This requires blocks to be at a minimum size. 
**BTC and Transaction Fees:** I want bitcoin to be a digital gold. A gold substitute has a much higher market cap potential than a payment network. Bitcoin is a bad payment network by design, it's much better store of value. I would happily pay $0.05 - $5.00 every time I wanted to move all my gold from point A to point B. 
**Payment Network**: I want payment networks to be done on higher layers on the Blockchain. Imagine if Lightning Network nodes were like instant payment service providers. You set up a channel with your provider, and now you can use Lightning Network for your every day coffee, and the service provider will worry about the hops to get it to the destination. Of course, you always hold your funds because if something goes wrong, you can close the channel and end the contract with your provider.
This is my vision, for how I'd like to see it play out. It does 3 things:
* Helps keep blockchain decentralized.
* BTC serves as a great store of value, and digital gold.
* Great for everyday payments as well.
@_date: 2016-02-10 16:47:19

To everyone who uses Coinbase to store funds: You should withdraw your btc and send it to your own wallet you control.
The more btc you have stored with them, the more potential problems you will have with KYC/AML when someday you try to withdraw a big amount.

Those articles may not be 100% accurate. People are mining with whatever energy they can get.
In China, energy is very cheap. There are some hydro energy miners there.
In Texas people are mining with wind energy at 2.5cents kwh.
In Canada people used to mine with hydro, but I think it was cut off.
Venezuela people are mining with any energy they can find. 
In some places people are even mining with unused liquid natural gas that gets burnt, instead they use it to mine.

There is no really good _legal_ solution afaik.
1. BTC being accepted by their suppliers - This doesn't solve the cash out problem for the end supplier. And profits would still need to be held in BTC which wouldn't be desirable for normal businesses.
2. Federal decriminalization - Then credit cards will be used, and the only reason people would pay with btc if there was a price incentive to do it.

That's the main thing that bugs me. That's why it feels so scammy.
To distribute airdrops via Blockchain Wallet can be done in many ways without collecting KYC data from the user. It's almost like they cut a deal with Stellar to boost users and Stellar probably gave them a super cheap rate to unload XLM so the business model that Blockchain is trying to do here is buy XLM for cheap and pay customers to register KYC-data accounts with them. 
If you think about security and internet related fraud, these types of AML/KYC airdrops are dangerous for consumer protection because it incentivizes people to create numerous accounts with ID's being collected via unauthorized methods. Knowing that each successful account generates $25 minimum. 
The model Blockchain chose to use is very selfish.

The answer is no. A few people have gotten sample units. They have been publicly saying for months that they will begin shipping in mid to late march.
So far, based on all their communications, manufacturing &amp; testing videos, I see no reason to doubt. They have also allowed people to test the miners at conferences. A good way of showing you're legit is not getting offended by questions, and also providing appropriate responses, which so far they have done both. Check their Twitter.
Also backed by some very reputable old school bitcoin folks.
I'm not vouching for them, just stating the facts, but I am rooting for them as a solid competitor to Bitmain.

@_date: 2017-10-23 03:04:17
Well of course you don't just change the address from a 3 to a 1 for implementation of segwit wallet. That was a anwer to your question asking, "how do you think the front-end interface should look with Segwit addresses?" 
No matter how it looks on the "front-end interface". That's their choice on how they want it to look.
The point is it's not done yet, and Segwit benefits have been available for months now. It shows wrecklessness when they are for endorsing a upcoming hard fork, yet lagging on implementation of latest *available* features of the current stable Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:25:35
Bro, these people claim to be Bitcoin companies that have been around for years now. You would think following the developments of the largest decentralized network (bitcoin blockchain), which their business depends on, is something they should do. Segwit was being coded and tested publicly on Github for years through a community of open source developers. Wallet implementation guides were also available publicly like a year before Segwit was even activated to be able to be used on the bitcoin blockchain.
The hypocrisy lies in the fact that these companies are endorsing potentially destabilizing hard forks on the public blockchain, yet they are not even utilizing current blockspace available through a up-to-date wallet. The side effects of this lead to increased fees &amp; confirmation times for their users. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:22:39
Good job. I agree with you, I don't support Segwit2x incompatible fork.

Simple, every bitcoin address will start with a 3 instead of 1. Nothing else changes in the front-end interface via segwit addresses. To answer your question.
We have the largest bitcoin exchanges utilizing segwit addresses already.

It's interesting to note that this topic of a POW change is kind of frowned upon by some in the community, because everyone is so invested in the price.

The word virtual currency term that NYDFS coined using Bitcoin as an example, should really only apply to virtual fiat. Like DAI, USDC, and other stablecoins.

I'd like to elaborate too. Let's say you want to buy some porn from a website. You don't want people to know what kind of stuff your into. So you send your coins from Coinbase to a mixer. And of course you can't send it straight to the mixer because Coinbase would shut off your account, so you need to send it to your wallet, then a mixer.
Now you've mixed your coins, and you send the porn website some btc. You get a utxo change output which could be linked to that porn website, so you need to mix your coins again. 
Then you send your mixed coins to Coinbase, they will tell you, "hey, these are mixed coins. Why are you using laundering tools to mask your transactions"
This is why a true privacy-by-default coin, such as Monero (the only real privacy coin available) or Grin (testnet3) are much better to use for day-to-day transactions. You do not need to go through the effort of mixing coins because every transaction is private by default.

Segwit benefits require ZERO interface changes which would affect user experience. I don't know what you're referring to.


By transaction batching, they could save on fee's to make new transactions. Currently, their users are already paying higher fees since their using legacy addresses. They should have started using Segwit wallet as sooner like Bitstamp, batched all their transactions, and move to Segwit transactions. Heck, they could even start now, keep fee's the same for the user while they do it. The longer they wait, they are just more expensive to use.
This is a guide they can use -

Bonds, IRA, 401k, pension, tbh I don't have any of that shit because it's all based on fiat. To me it's a scam. I don't even believe in the concept of "retirement". I just think you have to have enough money and cash flow till you die. I'm 28 and even though every paycheck, social security takes a shit ton of taxes, I've mentally just marked it as a loss. I doubt I will be getting any social security, I doubt it will even be around. And if it is, it's gonna be worth pennies of the taxes they took out.
But i'm kind of extreme in that sense.

Yes, but fees do change which block your transaction gets included in.
ProHashing argument is that they cannot make transactions because blocks are full. This is impossible. You can always make transactions no matter what the block size is.
ProHashing can easily solve this problem by increasing their miners fee on transactions, but they are just blaming this on the block size.

Yeah but Core has done much for in terms of scalability. Why do you assume block size limit is the only scalability obstacle?

I like to think there is 2 types of bitcoin fans. One is someone who has a vision of decentralization, disrupting intermediaries, and follows the original cypherpunk vision of privacy.

The market is still searching for a smart contract platform that isn't "middleware"
People want to use btc, the native currency, for their smart contract applications.
Counterparty is a excellent and well designed platform, but my honest opinion is that the winning platform will use bitcoin btc as it's currency. 
That's the story behind Mastercoin (now Omni) as well. Many others too.

I am also an Amazon affiliate, but you get on average 6%, and you do not get credited for purchases you make. 
And proof in case you have any doubt: 
I don't think anyone can argue that Purse.io business strategy isn't based on fraud. They collect BTC fees from buyers, and the people who buy the goods convert their stolen credit cards to BTC. All the risk is left on receivers of the goods, and of course Amazon.com to deal with the chargebacks.
This is just my opinion...

Who else, besides someone who is trying to hide something or launder money would pay 15-20% more with a credit card to buy btc? The whole business model of Purse doesn't add up. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out.
The purpose for Purse sellers is to buy BTC by showing a Amazon.com purchase on a statement. There is really no need to do that unless you are doing something fishy, or have a stolen credit card.
I have been a Amazon member since 2008, I would not risk my account to save 15%. Until Amazon.com comments on Purse.io's business model, or Purse says they have permission from Amazon, I would not use them. It's not even FUD, it's the truth.
The risk all goes to the consumer getting the delivery, not on Purse.io or the buyer.

Yes tangible negative outcomes is that if Bitcoin ever needed to be compromised, there is a few companies/individuals which can be contacted/forced to act maliciously.
Even so, read gmaxwell's post the other day about how dangerous even 30% can be: 
There are lots of ways Bitcoin's Proof of Work can be drastically cut to perform an attack. I think we can agree that 75% of hashing power comes from mining datacenters. Governments can go straight to the electric company and tell them to stop providing electricity to these companies. And poof, there goes 75%. I love Bitcoin, don't get me wrong, but there are flaws with PoW. From what I have researched, is DPoS is much better because the number of entities you need to collude with is much higher.

ABRA isn't gonna work because the incentive is not correct for the tellers. 
Tellers have to carry around the cash and act as the money transmitters. They are taking huge legal and safety risks.
I doubt any teller would want to do this for any less than 5-10%. If a teller does a $100 transaction, I am sure they will want $5-10 for their time. 
If tellers are actually situated in a office type environment, $5-10 isn't gonna pay the bills unless there is huge volume. If the tellers are just individual people meeting up similar to Local Bitcoins type sellers, then it's also not in the tellers best interest to meet some random stranger, coordinate time and meetup, and take the legal and safety risks for $5-10 for a $100 transaction.
The faster cheaper safer ratio is still better with Moneygram/WU

Let's hope that Coinbase has been accumulating ETC at current prices, because if the price keeps rising, it will be much more expensive for them to purchase the funds they owe to GDAX customers who were forced to wait 2 weeks.
I am not invested in either ETH or ETC, but there seems to be a incentive to buy ETC if Coinbase did in fact lose their ETC. Reason is Coinbase has to buy some to return to their customers. And the more expensive ETC becomes, this grows Coinbase insolvency fears.

Theres alot of controversy on the Blockstream topic, and 90% of the time when people are posting about them, it's trolling.
Blockstream was a company founded by a few Core developers. There are people in the industry, who don't like the path Bitcoin Core developers are taking (my opinion is that they're doing a great job), and they blame Blockstream for this.
In my opinion, Blockstream is a excellent company, and one of the few who has contributed to the most important Bitcoin protocol developments.

I doubt they will run the software. That's like saying all the people signalling BU were running BU. No they weren't, they were running Core. Otherwise they would have been down for half the time.
I suspect the same will happen with Segwit2x. They will signal Segwit2x, for activation of Segwit, but they will be running Core. Latest Core is compatible with Segwit, so once it's activated, they will still be compatible.

As long as we get Segwit, they can say whatever. The permissionless innovation starts at Segwit :D
Yeah, it is nonsense. I think even the miners signalling Segwit2x, I bet many of them are just agreeing so we can get Segwit. 2mb has no consensus.

sha256 - nsa

Verification is only going to be required more and more. Its best to just keep those documents handy. Bitstamp already has so many happy users. I seriously don't think they would care if one person who could not/did not want to verify his account, decided to close the account.
They have rules and regulations to follow if they want to remain in business, and they can't please everyone.

It depends how you look at it.
It won't be more expensive (than it is now) to make a standard transaction, but a Segwit transaction will be cheaper.
Segwit makes Segwit transactions cheaper by reducing the size of the transaction. Standard transactions will stay the same size.
That's the user incentive.

To increase the value of your savings in Bitcoin. Look at it this way, you bought 5BTC to speculate/save. Now you want to buy something online which is $20, and lets say you have a Coinbase account. So your choices are either credit card or Bitcoin. You can charge your card $20, or you can buy $20 worth of Bitcoin from coinbase and immediately transfer it to the business. Either way you spent $20, but when you spend $20 on Bitcoin when you already own Bitcoin, it will increase the value of your savings because more Bitcoin was bought from the market.

I do agree, but the verification they require is needed for them to stay in business. BTC-e will get shut down sooner or later for being a unlicensed money transmitter servicing US customers. Then we are going to see the, "All my btc and ltc have been stolen" drama again. Do the verification, even if its a hassle, because at least you get the security of using a stable, legal, and trusted exchange.

Yeah man, sorry if it sounded harsh but thats the reality. Anyone who sends a PayPal payment can easily get it reversed, and Bitcoin cannot be reversed.

Bitcoins main purpose is not even currency. Its a API for programmable cash. There is so much development going on for protocols and add-ons to Bitcoin. Some of these can even make a satoshi (.00000001 btc) worth an oz of gold. That satoshi may not have much btc/usd value, but it represents your stake of a oz of gold. So many other things bitcoin can and will be used for just besides currency/speculation. Although, the people who have stocked up on coins will have a nice wealth in the future.
@_date: 2013-08-25 21:04:29

@_date: 2013-12-25 19:18:42

bitcoin is the bubble, everything else is just growth

I doubt hes bullshitting
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:54:29
brainwallet as cold storage is the best way to go. 10+ non-phrase words, in random order, is the best way to do it. Its like 200 bit security. And 60 bit has not been broken yet so its pretty secure.

Coinbase support is non-existant. It takes more than 2 months to get a reply. They also have a ton of bugs in their system.
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:49:54
I miss the ease of bitfloor
@_date: 2013-09-12 01:39:52
There may be a incentive to produce coins, but will there always be a incentive to own coins? Thats my more specific question, thanks
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:48:08
Well I was really happy to see my Bitstamp account was already credited the next morning! So kudos to them for the quickness!
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:24:28
download the github raw html file and use that on a airgapped computer
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:34:54
Cartman buys Bitcoins, gets hacked, and they all find the hacker and kick his ass and take the bitcoins back. That would be a badass episode 
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:19:54
upvote for this guy he is my friend from college selling these miley christmas ornaments. I told him if he sells it for btc he will make more sales than paypal.

lol 2011 was probably great
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:30:50
I bought a domain with namecheap.com. It was the best thing ever. I highly recommend webmasters to get their domains from namecheap.com
The total came out to 10.87 for .0103, so I go to coinbase, instantly buy .0103 (Paid about 20 cents extra) and immediately sent it to the bitpay address. Viola, like immediately my account was funded. It was awesome
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:22:49
Fuck everything about these guys, just because some cash was used to buy some coke, are they going to deny the cash for their funding? 
Damn hypocrites. Every day Bitcoin is looking more like a trap.
Dark Wallet and Mastercoin are beginning to look better everyday.
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:57:19
yeah but getting money into campbx takes a while...

Getting paid is very relevant.. Still looking for a more serious response to my question, its not sarcastic. Its a real question I have lol because I am going to be a merchant
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:52:51
LOL doesn't take a genius to figure that one out 
@_date: 2013-08-31 22:34:58
ever think that these coins have been stored on that wallet before bitcoin hit $10
@_date: 2013-10-10 20:36:50
Fuck you too Dwolla. And Mastercard, you can suck it too.
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:21:43

Put your wallet.dat file in a faraday cage lol
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:10:55

@_date: 2013-12-10 15:59:56

@_date: 2013-08-24 02:58:32
Good thing it was Dollars and not $5 million worth of bitcoins
@_date: 2013-09-11 01:35:57
Noone is gonna sell you bitcoins for PayPal. Unless they want to get chargebacked and have their bitcoins stolen
@_date: 2013-09-13 21:54:19
be sure to get tracking number and delivery confirmation, and insurance
@_date: 2013-09-06 16:21:30
I think NSA is also behind Bitcoin. My reasonings behind that:
1. NWO wanted a global digital currency.
2. SHA-256 was created by NSA.
3. Digital Signature Algorithm created by NSA.
4. NSA published electronic cash document in 1996 which closely resembles Bitcoin.
For me, its not a bad thing. I have invested some too, and having the NSA sort of "back it" if I can say, gives me a deeper feeling that it is going to be huge in the future and I will make a great return of investment from it.
If they wanted Bitcoin to be gone, they would have smashed it by now. The fact that it is getting media attention and govt allowing it to grow only reassures my opinion that Bitcoin is here to stay because they want it to stay.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:20:58
This is such a wonderful piece
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:14:55

@_date: 2013-12-04 23:55:16
Its still a work in progress, I need to find a way for it to automatically convert the dollar amount into bitcoins
@_date: 2013-08-23 03:12:18
Thanks Diapolis, I will spread this $2 tip around to someone who deserves it And eventually it will come back to you
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:46:36
Better to get it now than later. Later the prices will be higher, and it will be more difficult to get in with barriers of entry created by regulators
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:39:35
I'd say 1200
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:32:52
It was never broadcasted, take the wallet.dat, import it to blockchain.info web wallet, look under archived addresses, and your funds will be there. Un-archive the address
@_date: 2013-12-29 15:15:27
buy at market price to spend, and hold the coins you had before.
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:54:35
A 24 random character password is not that great. You need to use 9-10 RANDOM words to make a secure brainwallet.
electricity omelet dictionary michaeljordan bigtits envelope racecar
something like that is a good brainwallet. 9-10 words completely random is a good brainwallet

The 3k club has bugatti's
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:50:30
Wow dude, you should just wait a few days and sell immediately if you borrowed $300k. And when you cash out, 33% profit will go to short term gains tax if you do it legally.
Buying at the all-time high with $300k on a loan is really not a good idea. Because if it drops to lets say 300 tomorrow, all your Bitcoins are only worth like $190k, and you'll be going into debt that way.
The saying is only put what you can afford to lose, you cannot afford to lose $350k which is on a loan.
And if you spend your Bitcoins to refill your alzheimers medication, how are you going to repay the loan?
Essentially you just got a loan to gamble, and there are very high chances that the price is about to drop soon.

Looks like the arbitragers are getting paid out and now the Bitstamp prices are going to start matching the MtGox prices when they start buying back lower
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:46:06
I bet at least 1 million out of the 12 million in circulation are lost
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:07:47
As someone who uses Bitcoin as a store of value, it worries me that Bitcoin will be replaced by something better. Hopefully that doesn't happen in the next few years

They already do bitcointrust.co
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:33:25
Bitcoin transactions ARE instant. Its the confirmations that take time. From the time I got to the bank to the time I left, definitely took an hour to get the wire done.
