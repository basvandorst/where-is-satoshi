I agree,  until you educate yourself self about moving bitcoin, hw wallets, and so forth, just leave that small amount at coinbase.

@_date: 2017-12-08 03:31:17
What you're doing is not hodling. If you want to hodl right, your bitcoin should be tucked away on a hw wallet and not put out to risk. What you are doing is called swing trading or scalping.

Yes its doable, I have done it many times but it's stressful as fuck, when you've sold your coin then it keeps going up and up and up without you. You can't help but wonder if it will ever again be as cheap as when you sold. Do you think you can hold it together for days or weeks for it to possibly come back down? Or will you buy back in at a higher price before it gets even more expensive? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:52:49
