Agreed. I was just there last month.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:55:05
Yeah, what the hell? I bought at .71 and sold at 1.16 thinking it would drop overnight. It's done nothing but skyrocket. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:15:49
Market maniuplation, panic selling, high transaction fees, etc..........

Take this BS back to FB
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:00:17
Oh, so you've been there?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:37:48
Dude, with a wife like that, it sounds like you already won the lottery
@_date: 2018-09-04 04:34:31
How ironic
@_date: 2018-05-31 20:37:44
I found an absinthe bar in Prague that accepts BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:39:06
Just maybe...... you shouldn't decide why someone else should or shouldn't get into crypto.  Everyone comes here for different reasons. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 05:12:37
Etoro = egarbage

Fat fucks like this would much rather stay with a 700 year old double ledger system because it's much easier to line their pockets with. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 06:00:15
One ATM is at DEPOT 2015. The other 2 are at different Tescos. I'll have to look at my photos tonight to find the name of the new place. It's right on the main square across from the church. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:14:35
Your idiotic response shows you know ZERO about cars
@_date: 2019-01-07 16:10:03
Wait.... Who were you responding to?
@_date: 2019-01-12 10:39:55
You definitely picked a non-crypto friendly country to do this in. Best of luck on your journey.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:29:22
Not if you plan on rebuying lower
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:13:52
So the dumbass lets this story get out forgetting that he owned this asset when he filed for bankruptcy................Nobody ever said he was smart.

I was in Prague last year and also found an absinthe bar that accepted Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:28:33
Oil companies often speak out against electric cars too............what else is new?
@_date: 2019-01-06 09:21:05
I normally go to Plzén. There are 3 ATMs there and a new store has opened where you can buy Bitcoin. They will help you set up a wallet if you are new.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:21:28
Speaking of trying to look clever; your definition is the complete opposite of a dead cat bounce. Smh
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:00:33
Yes, but only after he is fired for becomming irrelevant. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:16:04
Unfortunately alts depend on bitcoin even though it's older tech. Since it was the first, it will most likely always be around.
It's like dating a hot chick, but you have to bring her older and uglier sister along or her parents won't let her go.

@_date: 2018-02-02 11:14:24
I was going to post the same thing
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:56:20
Exactly! The community that uses it is the correct answer. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:54:21
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:49:36
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:24:45
Ok................so what if it beccomes no longer profitable to mine, who will confirm the transactions? IE......who will run the network? No miners = no bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:26:25
Because there haven't really been dips, its been straight down.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:26:33
Must me an American 12 year old little girl word. Now go find a safe space.
We're done here.

Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...........
About damned time
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:26:39
Dead cat bounces don't qualify
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:00:22
How about they answer for all the fradulent chargeback claims against peple that sold crypto on their site first?
Ebay/Paypal biggest scammers ever. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:59:06
I live in Germany. People notice my 93 Cobra SVT more than they do Lambos...........
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:36:56
Thanks. I'll take what I can get  :)
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:05:34
Looks like an opportunity for a scalp to me
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:01:47

Except Sen. Warren, she just wanted to be her usual self.

Nobody even knows what a chavvy car is. Stop using made up words like a 12 year old little girl. And since you've probably never been on the Autobahn, who gives a fuck what you like.... Bye Felicia.

They should bring in Andreas for testimony just like the Canadian parliment did. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:19:10
If you've seen it thousands of times that means the price has retracted often and those people were most likely right. Any other smartass comments or do you just like looking like a prick?
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:22:29
I was dead on and I get down voted. Gotta love Reddit.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:33:26
Kind of like somebody just having to make fun of someone else on social media because they are a loser in real life? Talk about small cocks.
Bye you fucking pussy.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:16:25
I'm trading on Bitfinex. Currently at 8150. I expect a bounce @ 8000 to at least 8500-8700. Then most likely back down. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:23:42
You spelled POS wrong
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:01:22
Hmm.................first all, I'm not a refugee; second, it's over 600hp at the wheels; third, go fuck yourself. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:04:46
And your comment doesn't make sense. There are only 2 registered 93 cobras in all of Germany, so refugees don't exactly come into the equation. But, your jealousy is almost childlike.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:19:05
Yep. The entire point of crypto was to operate outside the purview of traditional financial establishments. Instead, it invited it right into bed with it. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:09:26
It won't go that low. That is below the cost for mining one BTC.
