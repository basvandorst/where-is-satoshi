Thanks for your feedback, the ID verification is something we're still discussing. We decided to initially follow the example of fotolia.com that ask for the ID. Can you send us some sites that do not require ID verification? Thank you very much!

The legislation text is to advise publishers, since they're responsible for trying to sell something they might be forbidden by their laws, and of course, if we find that the publisher is not the does not have copyrights then we remove the content from the website.
Anyway, you're right about some of the texts are confusing, i'll review them and take in consideration what you said here. Thank you very much sir, that was very helpful. Thanks!!

I'm sorry you didn't liked my nickname, i can do nothing about it =)
But thanks for the heads up.

Wow, that is actually a good idea! We're just beginning, but there are plans to make more integrations with blockchain, the ones i have in mind is register the invoices in blockchain, so buyers would have a "distributed certificate" of the aquisition, and integration with multiple wallets, so you would be able to plugin your own wallet/payment processor instead of using ours. I'll keep what you said in mind. Thanks!

A quick search you can find all information you want...
We're on business for over a year...
UseCryptos is not only a trading platform, is also a payment gateway, used for photobtc and online wallet. The information we need for usecryptos is the same that we need for selling photos, so why make another one?
@_date: 2015-06-14 13:52:15
UseCryptos was initially published in Brazil, with the company eTreeLab Technologies LTDA, a few months ago, it was moved to Portugal and the terms are outdated.

Yes, we just published the website yesterday and we're looking for sellers to publish their content. Give it some time =)
@_date: 2015-06-14 23:46:46
We'll be happy to see your content published. If you have any doubts just ask.
There are one or two other sites (that i know) that sell photos for bitcoin, both are poorly made, and one of them is only for porn.
Thank you very much sir!

The ID is no longer needed. You only need to send your Full Name, Birth date and Address (text only).

That is actually the law for copyright of the Eiffel tower...
I agree with you that many kinds of copyright rules are crap, but its not in our power to change them, and they actually make our job harder...

*Thumbnails are no longer required for posting photos and illustrations, they will be re-sized from the original file.

Hey there, we just launched photobtc.com, i think it might be interesting for you to take a look. Here is a reddit topic about this: 
@_date: 2015-06-16 20:25:02
useCryptos started in Brazil and then moved to Portugal several months ago, so now it is a Portuguese company with a European bank account, trading in EUR... People need to look things up before talking.
@_date: 2015-06-14 20:14:48
What do you consider private information btw?
@_date: 2015-06-17 23:36:39
Nice! If you have any doubts, suggestions, complaints or anything else, just talk to us... 
@_date: 2015-06-14 18:42:31
Actually i'm the one that should thank you for having the trouble for pointing this out this way. Thanks for the help, and i'll be waiting for your work! =)

**Why you must upload ID?**
1- We can make sure (or at least try) the publisher has copyrights over the contents being sold.
2- To apply with useCryptos's KYC/AML policies, since PhotoBTC uses its Bitcoin services.
**Why must I register account at shady company?**
PhotoBTC and useCryptos are both products of MountainCode LDA Portugal, and both use the same registration process.
Also, why you think useCryptos is a shady company?

Maybe the word "forbidden" is too extreme, it should say that you require a release for those cases.

It was verified some time ago =) We've done some upgrades since the weekend, and still working. Enjoy!

As i just said to the other guy there, this was something we were still discussing. And now this was just altered, you only need to send your Full Name, Birth date and Address (text only).
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:26:18
Hey, let me know if you have any suggestions =)
@_date: 2015-04-11 18:09:13
If Bitcoin was directly in Paypal would be much better... First time i've heard of Braintree was because of bitcoin xD
@_date: 2015-04-11 23:38:39
Oh, ok then. Hope this don't happens with other people then. Thanks for checking on other browsers =)
