Anyone can do it! 
So why haven't you? Show us your lambos and get to work.

Some people need their hand held.

Introducing people to Bitcoin that would never get in otherwise is not bad for Bitcoin.

Same is true of everything that is curated information. We make a killing on information that anyone could find with enough time and energy. So far, about 3 people in the world have.

Exchange used a low fee and just wondering how long I should expect to wait. Livecoin.net if anyone is familiar with them specifically.

Anyone doing business with Bitcoin or anything similar should be. There are about a billion laws covering things that help people make money.

I would go. I would obviously stop by to tell my past self to invest in Google, Apple, Amazon and Bitcoin first.

Not everyone can know every damn thing.

He leases the cars or at least one of them. Showed this clearly on H3H3 I believe.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:08:30
He's rich, no matter what you have to say about his lowly rentals.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:06:29
It's part of the pitch you weirdo.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:11:08
He's not advertising to you. How any of you figured out HOW to buy Bitcoin is mind blowing.

Same issue on a transaction in this batch.
Receiving end says "low fees" which is ridiculous from an exchange but that's crypto.

Every single person in history that has sold curated information on how to make money, no matter the topic, has been called a scammer by 80% of their customers. This is true no matter how effective the shit they are selling is.
Because the lazy assholes that buy this stuff are mostly too lazy to do anything with the info. Others are too dumb. 
Your long winded rant is ridiculously silly.

There are thousands of them floating around Facebook. People that made money after buying a course that is.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:02:21
There are about 1000 of these already out there, nothing novel. They call them "mastermind" courses.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:07:55
Showing them off wouldn't make you millions.
