For the amount of ppl there I’d say is Bcash day
@_date: 2018-08-07 18:15:52
That’s a good point. However if you believe that’s going to happen, you should be buying and therefore looking for the cheapest price in fiat conversion.
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:27:41
May happen 
@_date: 2018-08-10 09:00:35
Could be, but check 2022 ;)
@_date: 2018-08-10 18:19:08
Halvings dates are correct
@_date: 2018-08-07 19:27:08
I don’t understand 
@_date: 2018-08-07 18:04:49
I mean FIAT. If you earn FIAT, converting it to BTC is more expensive as the prices BTC/FIAT goes up. Therefore you get less BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:54:42
And a million later ;)

Who is this guy?
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:00:35
How is peer coin going?
@_date: 2018-10-03 16:45:54
You won’t need it
@_date: 2018-10-05 06:33:16
No, you can’t 
@_date: 2018-06-30 22:11:48
Two many assumptions here. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:38:58
How do you sign a contract when doing a call, what if you have the wifi off? You can’t call?
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:55:01
What are the implications of this ?
@_date: 2018-06-30 14:29:04
Are we sure is finished yet?
I’d like to buy more
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:18:48
If you can pay your ride in a big city with btc is a good sign about the adoption going forward. Is nice when you spot these signs.
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:15:32
Do you receive many spammy calls via VoIP?
@_date: 2018-06-08 12:00:27
What is the meaning of ETF?
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:29:55
I mean the coffee shop
@_date: 2018-06-19 13:46:18
There is no way mister. You should think it twice before putting money you need in something you don’t know how works
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:33:36
Where do you buy the food/clothes? I’d like to use more btc but can’t find many shops accepting it.
@_date: 2019-10-13 16:47:15
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:30:30
What if you just want to do a quick call?
@_date: 2019-10-01 18:09:11
Please stop the chaia shit spam
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:04:34
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:07:00
Nice! Where is the place?
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:00:46
I’m talking about running out not about existing less. Notice the difference.
@_date: 2018-06-19 14:44:56
Another step to mass adoption, beautiful!
@_date: 2019-10-13 16:45:14
@_date: 2019-10-13 16:45:32
Holy shit

The best is yet to come
@_date: 2018-07-20 21:44:32
Look like ages
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:31:23
