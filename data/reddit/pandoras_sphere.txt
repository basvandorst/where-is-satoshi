Only if the block-chain is combined with public disclosure of expenditures metadata in a systematic way that has not been invented yet.
Even so there is need of dark budgets.  Employees on business travel would not want their expense reports made public.  Many employees would not want their salary public.  I've worked for places that make public disclosure of individual employees compensation, and places that don't.  The transition would be painful for many organizational cultures.   
There is still a need for dark budgets to enable bribing people. Despite FCPA the CIA still does it.  Hell perhaps the state department did it.

Fees are already too high.  This does not address how the decision is made to increase block size, or keep non bitcoin transactions out of the block chain.  
@_date: 2014-08-10 15:59:19
Fees to get it in the block after next is around 0.5 mBTC/kB (1).  And a typical transaction is ~250 B.  So a typical fee is 0.1 mBTC (0.05 USD).   Square charges 2.75%.  This means Square is cheaper than bitcoin for anything less than $1.80 such as a cup of coffee.
There is talk about off chain transaction and trusted intermediaries, but such a set up must 
*  Use bitcoins
*  Be reasonable transparent
*  Open source
*  As easy to use as bitcoin

Yes, [This is mostly copypasta from a previous comment I made](
My understanding is that the blockchain is a authoritative distributed ledger of all transactions without numbers that can be attached to people(1).
Each block is like a page in the ledger. When a bitcoin is transferred from A to B it is signed over using A's private key to B's public keys. This is transmitted to all, and included in the next page on the ledger. The private keys are kept in a secret wallet.dat file on a user's computer.
Each page on a ledger has a special number, this special number is a hash function of all transactions on the page, the previous page's special number, and a nonce (random number). Each page's special number must be below a certain value decided by the difficulty. Miners take all the pending transactions and try to find a nonce that will create a valid block/page. When a miner succeeds the miner gets the reward (original bitcoins) and and fees. The ledger is authoritative because the longest ledger is the correct one.
When one recieves a bitcoin the computer looks through the block chain/ledger to make sure that it is valid. It follows all the signatures back to the bitcoins origin, when some miner awarded bitcoins to himself for the page creation reward.
Anonomousness is preserved by using many different accounts in the ledger, and using each one sparingly.
Eventually, and in theory one will not need the entire ledger, but just the the pages that are needed to verify one's coins.  One will need the special numbers on each page of the ledger, but not the content of each page.  More development is needed for these light clients, but its on roadmaps.

I also mentioned Hash.  A Hash is a function that takes numbers and find a characteristic short number.  A hash function has no known inverse.  Hashes are used to create that special number on each block.  SHA-2 is the hash function I believe is used in bitcoin.
I don't really expect CBS to explain all this in a TV show.  I just wanted the technobable to sound more plausible.  
I liked in the episode how random text in the blockchain came into play.  This type of thing has happened before.  [Miner's have slipped in poems and such in the blockchain.](   Any miner can or could do this(2). However, Satoshi and perhaps Gavin Newsom have the ability to message all bitcoin clients.

Luke Jr. is accused of being a poisonous person.  Specifically he is accused of creating extra [BIPs, or BitCoin Improvment Proposals](  These are proposals relating to the bitcoin protocal that are voted on with mining power.  
[BIP 16]( and [BIP 17]( are beyond my ability to comprehend.  
[BIP 20]( and [BIP 21]( both deal with an official bitcoin URI standard.  
Luke Jr's (20) proposal is overly complicated.  LukeJr's BIP allows for values to be encoded in decimal, hexidecimal or tonal (wtf) values.  It also allows for transmitting private keys.  Private keys are suppose to remain private and not end up in URIs.    
BIP 21 is reasonable.  It specifies address, amount (decimal), and label.  It leave room for extra yet to be defined variables.  
BIPs are suppose to be discussed at length before calling for a formal vote.  I'd imagine the overly complex nature of Luke Jr URI BIP would of been called out by IRC, the mailing list and the like.
Based on a preponderance (more likely than not) of what I read so far; I'd say Luke Jr is a poisonous person.  However, having bad ideas is not a crime.  In fact all ideas, including bad ones, should be celebrated.  I'm sure there is more evidence both for and against this motion.

A SYSTEM EXISTS.
To avoid ballet box stuffing we need each ballot to have a name on it, however a voter's vote must remain secret.  Paper ballots should be preferred because computers are are hard to prove secure, work without electricity, and require less training to administer.  [Scratch and Vote]( provides a method to accomplish this.  
The magic is in the Homomorphic public key encryption.  This means that some operations are still possible under the blanket of encryption with the benefits of asymmetry.
Sorry, to fully explain this I need to go back to the top.
So on the left side of the ballot is the candidate names in random order.  On the right side are corresponding bubbles to fill in, and corresponding cipher text(s) in a 2D bar code.  The right side can contain a name of the voter.   The right side of the ballot is posted publicly on a web site.  The public right side contains a bubble, the corresponding cipher text and perhaps name/signature of the voter.  The left side with candidate's names in random order is destroyed by the voter onsite.    
After the community/nation comes to consensus on what votes are valid the sum of the cipher text is decrypted by mutually distrustful parties that can assemble the private key.  Because the public key is known, the public can verify that this is done correctly.
I left how how one can verify the ballot is well formed (that is the scratch part), and many more details.  Please read [Scratch and Vote: Self-Contained Paper-Based Cryptographic Voting]( by Adida and  Rivest.

I like how they use the argument that BitCoin is a commodity.  This argument was taken from [this paper by Reuben Grinberg of the Yale Law Review]( .
I didn't like the technobable.  They could have replaced most of the technobable with plausible technobable.  They could of used words like Hash, SHA-2, and public private keys.  The block chain was mentioned, but it was never explained that the block chain is effectively an anonymous ledger.

I don’t really understand open transactions, except that it sounds awesome.  Can we talk about Escrow transactions, because it’s a small subset of what is possible?
Lets say Alice purchases a Car/House from Bob; and Charlie is the escrow agent and sale is dependent on the car passing smog check or something.  Bob needs to be sure Alice cannot double spend the money in escrow.  Both Alice and Bob don't trust Charlie not to run with the money.  Is this possible?  Where does Alice sent Bitcoins such that Charlie can decide to revert the transaction or complete the transactions?

Yes, it will be easier to inspect the banks for cash on hand and loans.
Say they keep all deposits in account D, pay all loans from account L, and all payments on loans are forwarded into in account P.  The reserve ratio would be D/(sum(L,over all time)-sum(P, over all time)).  If this ratio goes too low, the bank is dangerous and would offer high interest rates.  If this ratio is high, it is safe and would offer low interest rates.
Anyways, I probably just touched the tip of the iceberg with accountability in bitcoin by publishing public keys.  I think bitcoin can bring accountability and competition to banks.

Cryptocurrency is not ready to support an entire country.  
Venezuala is 32 million people, with say 2 transactions/day.  That is 741 Transactions per Second [TPS].  Bitcoin limited to 7 TPS right now.

We need state channels, sharding, real light clients on phones, secure enclaves in phones, universal smart phone adoption ,small cheap nodes and other stuff before prime time.

Bitcoins are instantaneous and secure for amounts less than 50 BTC (~750 USD now).  
To pull off a double spending attack, the transaction must be transmitted through the network to reach the merchant, however the next transaction must not be included in the next block.  Nodes will only pass on the transaction if it does not conflict with other transaction in their buffer.  
There are two ways to pull this double spend attack off; either win the race to registrar the transaction with the miner destined to win the next block registering a laundering transaction; or be that miner and refuse to include the said transaction in that block.
Winning the race condition, while having the merchant believe the transaction is valid, would be hard with real life transaction.  It could also be overcome by having a trusted network of nodes that would confirm they all hear the same transaction.
Manipulating the next block would be hard in real world conditions.  It means the evil miner would have to sit on the solution until the transaction was completed. Someone else could find another solution in this time.  It would not be worth sitting on and risking a 50 BTC reward to steal 10 BTC of groceries.   
It's significantly easier to shoplift.

Its gone forever, but the devs have thought of that.
Bitcoin can be spent in increments down to ~10^-9 or incredibly small values at todays prices.  Hence, if bitcoins are the worlds currency prices for burgers will be measured in mBTC (10^-3), uBTC (10^-6), or nBTC (10^-9).  I once saw some chatter on the boards going even smaller to pBTC and beyond.  
Bitcoins are finite, and can be easily destroyed, but split to near infinitesimal sizes.  
Currently miners do not verify transactions less than &lt;.01 BTC, without a 0.01BTC transaction fee.  It is feared that trivial small transaction can be used to attack the database somehow.  mBTC, and uBTC transactions are just one boolean flag away if needed.

No, you don't need to be online nor synchronized to receive bitcoins.  Yes, you need to be synchronized to confirm you received them, or to spend them.  
The blockchain is like the authoritative bitcoin ledger, and each block like a page of the ledger.  You need the page that you received bitcoin to confirm you have the coins.  You need the page you recieved the coins to spend them.
