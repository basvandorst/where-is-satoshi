But that’s my point. It won’t always. Why would it?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:30:53
Oh? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:05:17
I want to know the same. Not because I’m concerned but just curious if this is the settling point for it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:23:03
...and you think this why?
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:34:55
Some of you are a little too confident that it’ll always bounce back up. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:11:50
I like how those who are heavily invested in it whether to make money or “the future” just always pretend that all this can’t just continue to drop and never go back up. There’s no guarantee. May be time to sell or time to accept a lower standard? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:55:26
It was fun while it lasted. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:39:30
Conspiracy theories. ��
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:23:15
What about the $5k part? I don’t think it’s going that low. Not now at least.

I know this isn’t really the place to ask but I don’t think it warrants a thread. If I buy BTC in Coinbase, why does in the receipt it show the price of BTC more when I bought it versus what the market showed at the time?

I’ll make it fun by posting a huge picture of your face on my race car for international TV to see. ��‍♂️
Props though for doing something cool like this. And 8 cents a pop. FML. ��

So I’ve been kind of out of the loop for a couple of days with the holiday. Just been watching some numbers and holding what I have. 
What’s the fork? Do I need to know about it or do anything? Or just keep holding. Yeah I spelt it wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:58:02
Yeah I didn’t buy a whole one. Sounds like you’re probably upset you missed the opportunity years ago.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:37:47
Thanks yeah I sent some over to GDAX I’ll probably start using that more since it’s more informative. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:47:33
Gotcha. If I don’t have Bcash or anything just some BTC and LTC does it even matter to me? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:37:07
Yeah but that’s not the price it said it was at when I bought it. I bought it because it showed less than that. Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:50:20
I don’t get why so many people play the “why didn’t I” game. Because you didn’t? Lol Buy now or wait for the next thing.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:50:06
So I should take my money out of GDAX? It’s not much but...
I mean I know it’s safer to hold it off an exchange but I just haven’t yet with what I’m doing. What benefit is from the fork?
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:32:19
Dude in any investments it’s a bumpy game this movement is hardly anything to lose your shit over.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:32:40
I’m just happy I was able to buy a little at 11.3 or so yesterday. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:19:40
Yeah I for one got excited by a small drop. Bought some this morning. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:47:18
Aside from BCH what did Coinbase recently do? I use GDAX but change if warranted. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:10:15
No I just thought people thought it was going to jump a bit this evening. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:22:13
What happened?
