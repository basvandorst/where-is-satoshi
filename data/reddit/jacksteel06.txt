It could be. Just saying to average in and not blow your wad.

Nothing.  Traders will just roll over to the next months contract.  Futures settlement dates are not any cause for price movement.  The price movement usually occurs the week before settlement dates to F over as many ppl as possible.  Also known as Max Pain.

Did I say I was wiser than the Oracle of Omaha?  Shit no. 
Simply saying that I believe Crypto do not have a place in his world view mainly because he is old and will not invest the mental bandwidth needed to learn it's intricacies. 
Thus, I am not putting too much weight behind his comment. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:36:51
So you are comparing BTC to the value of all publicly traded tech stocks combined?  LOL.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:43:00
Yes and those bubbles all popped.  Then grew again.  As will this.  But saying that the price correction going on right now, has no chance in hell of being a major event, is putting your head in the sand.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:07:09
BTC futures contracts are cash settlements only, so no BTC will trade hands on expiration.  This entire article is BS...
Source =  
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:34:17
My bad.  But it's actually impossible to show a longer term view on the daily b/c the chart goes so exponential...  Which is even more evidence that this could be a MAJOR correction in the works.
Here is weekly chart zoomed out...  Looks pretty convincing still.
 
Re: Timeframe, you absolutely could find many examples, and they would all follow the same bubble bursting theory as the example but on much shorter timeframes.  Market psychology works at all levels.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:49:03
Beginning of the end of what?  I'm not saying its going to $0...  Looking at the chart I'd say $4700 is a good retracement point.  
Then will slog around in a range until the next bubble.

Let's not forget, Buffett is 87 yrs old.  Try explaining BTC to your grandpa and see how that goes.  The guy is an unquestioned financial genius, but in my experience old men are very routine driven.  
BTC does not have a place in his head.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:00:59
Totally agree.  Anyone going all in like BTC is going straight up again is delusional.  I bought some ~$9400 but I think this goes down to ~$4500 before returning to normal. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:18:14
Lol that you're saying 20-30% is not carnage...  It shows what the average BTC HODL mind set is.  In any other market this is armageddon...
The fact that you think this way makes BTC becoming a legit currency a long shot.  Until 1-5% BTC swings happen 5 times a year at most, BTC will never have a place in the monetary world. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:28:51
It referrs to US markets opening...not individual ppl. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:25:08
It actually does on different time frames .  But this view, being so long term, makes the correction even more severe.
In the example chart he posted, if that was zoomed into, multiple corrections could also be seen.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:11:09
From a technical perspective, this is one ugly chart.  Anyone who is thinking of buying again better do so with limited amounts of $$ and plan to average in as it goes down/up.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:59:59
I'm really hoping that comment was a joke.  Either that or I've just seen the single worst financial comparison in my life.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:19:59
I posted this exact same thing before.  Text. Book.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:21:19
He posted a 10 yr chart...  How much do you want him to zoom out?
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:27:35
~$19K will be first major resistance.
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:51:54
They only want eyes on screens and ad clicks.  They will jump on any and every band wagon to do so.  CNBC is a joke of a financial news network, no serious trader watches that garbage.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:39:46
Ok, so here is the NASDAQ bubble popping...  Look familiar?  I'm not saying BTC won't bounce back.  But this could be the pop of the first bubble.
 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:11:33
Futures always lead the price action for any asset they trade in.  The big boys are most likely buying futures contracts to prop up price while selling actual BTC.  Then after they have unloaded their position they unwind their futures trade and the price tanks.
Rinse and repeat.  Retail traders will never win once institutional money is involved.  Thinking different will only serve to lose you money.  Not to say that HODL will not work, but this game has been changed forever.
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:25:51
BTC - Chart looks bullish! Having rejected the H&amp;S pattern forming, and breaking through a clear resistance line, I'd say there is room to run...
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:22:56
Which is why it will never have mass adoption...  Catch 22.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:41:52
Yes, but like BlackJack if you play by the book it increases your odds.  Technical Analysis is playing stocks by the book.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:03:40
No actual BTC is involved at all. Only monitary value of the coins under control of the contract.  And money is in no shortage whatsoever on Wall St. ...

First Fib support level on deck...  Lets see if she holds!

You need to feed the latter the former. Kind of like BTC mining...

BTC Technical Analysis...  One opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:49:25
Yes, my stop is at $16500
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:49:20
I don't think this is over guys...  
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:51:06
It depends on what time frame you trade.  H&amp;S, like most patterns form for all different time periods.  The max price drop of the pattern completing is relative to the time frames it's observed at. 
As far as accuracy, I'd bet that if you traded every one you saw you'd lose money.  But they are know as one of the most "powerful" patterns as far as velocity of the drop/rise if completely. 
It's prob mentioned the most b/c it's one of the most famous and new chart jockies look for it.

I'm short BTC futures now....  You see a chart like this you place a bet.  Tight stop above the previous high after that major dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:52:42
 - They have the best platform for Crypto charting by far!  
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:11:02
What not sell a futures contract and hodl ur actual BTC. If it goes down u are hedged. If it goes up cover your short and end up ahead.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:04:44
The BTC futures contract is cash settled, so won't have any affect on the supply/demand of actual BTC, thus no impact. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:10:14
I think its actually fascinating how this holds true on many timeframes.  Here is a 60-min chart from May 2017...  
 
Almost matches the pattern exactly and resulted in a 76% sell off before rebounding.  This could be a great level to look for if this current pattern holds true.
Edit:  Almost exactly the same level it dropped to in 2013 as well...
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:52:33
It's not the cleanest H&amp;S for sure, but ppl are looking at it nonetheless. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:07:57

Futures are just that, a bet.  Full stop.

It's an opinion piece as stated, just thought it was good commentary.

This is the pattern everyone is watching FYI...  If that neck line breaks ~$12500 in theory (Technical Analysis Theory) all hell breaks lose and watch out below.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:39:06
Until we clear yesterday's high BTC is not out of the woods.  Painting a double inside period which if breached to down side could get nasty again.

Forex markets have so much liquidity that it really limits the volatility.  Basic concept is explained here:
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:53:28
Or if there are a shit load of stops that get run.  I don't think it will go straight down either. I'm  picturing more of a roller coaster.

Drugs got into BTC b/c of me.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:31:02
A BTC futures contract should be very scary to anyone not a professional holding BTC right now.  
This opens up the BTC world to trading systems already designed and perfected to take advantage of the inherent volatility of BTC.  
They will bang the tape around in circles going on epic stop runs chasing out many retail traders who don't know what they are doing.  
I predict a massive drop in price followed by an equally massive ramp.  Longs will get squeezed out and shorts won't have time to get on board.
Just like Mike Tyson said "everyone has a plan until they get hit"

Seriously!  
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:35:22
Futures trading is almost entirely composed of machine trading algorithms that feed on high volatility.  BTC is perfect for them.  
They will bang the tape around shaking out weak hands on both the short and long side.  
It further provides a massive short selling platform.  So while people are waiting to BTFD, the algos with huge amounts of capital are on the sell side blowing through stops and collecting profits on the way.
I am by no means an expert or institutional trader but have traded futures for 6 yrs now.  I think this will be the end of the straight line up and make people really gut check before buying.  Not to say it won't go up to $100K, and HODL's will still HODL.  It's just going to be a Very. Bumpy. Ride.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:26:06
Wait till futures trading opens.  You ain't seen nothin' yet.

My prediction/buy level.
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:52:51
This is my current high level technical analysis of the situation.
There is huge amounts of resistance above...  
The $5873 low will be retested if the March low is broken in April.  Price target of $4657 for the bottom, breach of $12K to upside would make new highs possible.

e.g. - Every financial market. Ever.  These cock suckers having been stealing money hand over fist from retail investors for decades.  The BTC bubble gave them one of the easiest markets to manipulate on a silver platter.
It is not a coincidence that this started almost exactly as BTC futures came online.  If you think otherwise then you are the sucker.
