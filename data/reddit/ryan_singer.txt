Stay tuned. Miron Cuperman (former Tradehill CTO) and I are going to present a complete Hierarchical Deterministic Multi-Signature (HDM) wallet service at the Texas Bitcoin Conference next week. We have working reference implementations in python (based on electrum) and javascript (based on brainwallet).
