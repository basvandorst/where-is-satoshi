EDIT: FBI has authority to view NSA's Xkeyscore data - the infiltrator must of siphoned data to have gone as far as they did. That data can be traced. If the attacker is sloppy and shits where they eat, there's a good chance they'll get caught. For their stake I hope they did it overseas. Any transactions done through foreign accounts.
For everyone here, I hope you have ways to find the above :)

Coinbase closed my account 4-5 years ago for using my coins to buy weed (darkweb)
fast forward 5 years later, I want to buy more but I can't.

This thread is going to be a PR nightmare for them. They even had the CTO post and get wrecked on here.
This is going to be good.

I know you guys aren't exp. with fraud since I see PayPal on the list for payment options. Good luck.

Not to mention there is strict regulation. If you put in your returns that you invested that much into an unregulated currency, you can expect our nice friends, the taxmen, to pay you a visit! Enjoy calculating the hours put into that!

Anyone else finding it hard to believe that this Blockswater doesn't have a website? The only thing that comes up for Blockswater when you Google it is reference to this article.
This is fake news.

Think of this like the Federal Reserve pumping money into the U.S. Economy after the crisis. 
There was little liquidity, and suddenly massive amounts of buying pressure started coming into the markets. Everyone became complacent because there was always a buyer where there was a seller. The Fed. had inserted "fake" money into the system. Similar to what is going on here.
How does that relate to this? If I understand correctly, buying on margin from Bitfinex was inserting money where it did not exist before. Just massive amounts of buying really drove the price up. Holding margin positions require interest payments. Once its no longer profitable enough to hold those positions, selling will happen. That's when the real downwards cascade will happen. With these tethers, there are buyers and sellers of it; however, there are *real* people affected to. These are the people like you and me buying into Bitcoin at its current price. 
Are you fucked? If you get out in time, no. My analogy probably sucks, but someone else can describe it better. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 03:18:19
Ah, one day she'll have a big pile to buy lots of weed with.
That's what happens when your parents give you 50+ bitcoins to hold at a price of $200 each. Every last one spent on weed.
Fuck my life.

If I wished to reuse their services, which I probably will, I complied. On the other hand, I gave extremely vague responses, in response to extremely vague questions. 
They didn't take any coins away from me, or suspend the account. I still have full control of the account, but they have not yet responded.

In terms of FDIC insurance, Coinbase, to my knowledge, is the only one; they are subject to the constraints of the United States government. 
I don't know how to feel about this. Never did I expect this, especially since I did nothing wrong. It was insulting to say the least.
@_date: 2015-04-11 05:20:47
Its a real e-mail. They posted a message upon logging in that I got an important e-mail that requires my attention.

Cool concept.

I would say I'm pretty actively purchasing. I've maybe sold a tenth of what I've bought. It was after initiating a sale for ~$1200 that they sent me this "love letter." Purchase history definately suggests that I am more of one of their frequent customers.
Scratch that last statements. I was. Not going to use them any further.

This is so deeply concerning and alarming. I've heard of them limiting accounts associated with selling grayhat services (booters, resolvers, etc.), however, none of my payments were illegal in any nature. Never have I sent coins to the darknet, to any services associated with it, or anything to even question the integrity of my online transactions. 
Even further, this goes against everything Bitcoin, in our eyes, was intended for: anonymity. Why should I be forced to divulge my online activity when if I wanted to, I could of used my credit card or bank account? 
The greater irony lies in the fact that Coinbase didn't question my transfers when I bought from them; however this happened when I got coins from another source. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 15:12:47
If only they would accept those as answers. I got a response, a lengthy one. In the interest of time, I'll share the interesting parts: they read this post, and the many others. Of course they also read the part where I mentioned I would discontinue using their services, and they implied that complying is required for their longevity. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 04:37:38
We all knew PayPal sucked anyways. They just try harder and harder to reaffirm it and help spread the word themselves.

The CEO (or ex, not following) of Paypal was the founder of Coinbase. Paypal generated revenue by holding funds and accruing interest. See the connections here?

This has worked in my favor, as a buyer in the past. Seller shipped me the product, Paypal decided to go through the "lol fuck you" ways and for whatever reason, they reversed the transaction. Was a $20 buy so I had no problem resending it privately, but boy could that have been exploited.

Are you fucking kidding me? They'll pay reddit because they won't take down negative posts about them? Why the fuck don't you fix the negative aspects so they don't happen again? There's something you can actually fucking do. Jesus these people are ridiculous.
