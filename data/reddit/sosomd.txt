Thank you for sharing it:) 
I don't say to stop using the Bitcoin Paranoid app, you can use **CMC Alert** app in parallel with it. Use CMC Alert app only for notifications(I like it's simplicity), and others for graphs etc. 
Just try it, thanks

I downloaded your app, nice work !
You can try mine too, it's free and update are coming constantly. Users can work with both **Cryptonomy** and **CMC Alert**, why not to try it? 
Every time when there are big fluctuations in the Coin Market Cap, most of the coins are going UP or DOWN in the same way..
I recommend you **CMC Alert** app - It's a hidden notification, only way to see it is if you drag your notification tab down, you don't even know it's there, **heck your wife would never know that you are constantly checking the cap**. :D (  )

Thank you for the feedback!
The main point of having an overview about the **Coin Market Cap** was this: 
 *Every time when there are big fluctuations in the Coin Market Cap, most of the coins are going UP or DOWN in the same way. Be informed and act accordingly (for example, when it goes DOWN: you can move into other stable currencies or withdraw; etc.)*
As I said, we are going to add currencies in the near future, but step by step. Thanks for understading !
