There is quite a difference between science, more specifically *physics*, and the ideas that he's proposing.
You see *societies* are not physical particles that can be examines accoring to strict Laws of physics. To say something about man and the nature of society, to make predictions about possible future societies you need to engage in a multitude of disciplines like: sociology, psychology, politology, philosophy perhaps biology/ecology etc. 
It is an extremely difficult topic that is perhaps too complex to make any reliable prediction about, and is being completely *waltzed over* by this physicist.
Furthermore his ideas have a distinct totalitarian overtone and dismisses moral/ethical concerns entirely. 
It's a nice story, some nice ideas to think about. That's it.

Because most people want to see a price that leaves them completely incapable of comparison? Of measuring value? Yeah...

Let us not underestimate it. But yelling it *every time* at this stage is like celebrating victory when all you have is a couple of rebels and you're up against the Empire (had to think of a comparison...).
It makes you look a bit like a moron, out of touch with reality.
But yes, I too wish for bitcoin to become BIG. But for now that is just a wish connected to some really exciting, possibly revolutionary technology. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:16:16
This is true of most technological developments. See how much it costs for a business to invest in computers in the early days.  All there needs to be is a value proposition with a favorable and acceptable risk/reward ratio.

This is very important.
Hind sight and pointing to winners is a real problem in the world of investing. A good value investor for example has a *strategy* that he maintains that could mean for example that he only has 10% of his assets in a speculative investment (such as bitcoin, high uncertainty high potential reward). As soon as the price goes up 100% his strategy will dictate that he sells until his speculative assets are again at 10% total assets.  His greed however will tell him other things.
A good investor only emerges after decades, maybe a lifetime of investing, only then we can say who is an actual smart investor and who was just lucky.

I for one am in favor of the state and have not heard any *solid* arguments or solutions to how a stateless society will maintain the *myriad* services and securities that the state now provides.
The individual is too distracted, too uninvolved, too individualized and too greedy to *activily* participate in a society that depends on its citizens to take the reigns that government is now holding. Because it's not commerce between people, it is Politics (with a capital P) between people that first needs to be rehabilitated. People actually getting together and talking about the common good, people *actively* caring about and supporting the common good in a society where individual life choices are connected with morally relevant outcomes on a global scale. Commerce is only a small part of the picture. Commerce can easily be fueled by greed and fear alone.
If you do believe in a stateless society could you please direct me to a source that does more than just proclaim ideals and actually gives some concrete foundational support for how those ideals might work out in reality?

I don't really understand these people. They didn't pay *hundreds of dollars* they paid *bitcoin* probably knowing full well that the price of bitcoin has great potential to rise significantly.
They should have bought back the coins after spending them, their sob story is just an expression of their own ignorance and foolishness.

The smugness of your post is quite pathetic.
Some people *'get'* ideas that have not solid foundation in reasoned argument. A whole nation may *'get'* fist pounding and and angry shouting. 
What I "get" is that a lot of people are swayed by an idea without any real understanding about the consequences or reality it entails. I am very open and welcome any reasoned argument about the topic. But this smugg attitude without providing any substance is pathetic.

We need more 'general purpose' internet companies accepting bitcoin. I think Overstock is great because everyone needs sheets. 
The bitcoin "community" is quite small at the moment and more specialized little places are accepting bitcoins than general purpose stores. The problem is that a "bitcoiner" will easily switch and start buying household appliances at overstock, but won't suddenly crave a sausage from a small italian vendor in another state or country. Thus the sausage vendor might become disillusioned with bitcoin because he's not getting any more business from it. His market segment is too small and specific to gain access to the tiny bitcoin pool.
In the Netherlands I have only one real place where I spend bitcoin and that is for takeout food at thuisbezorgd.nl because that is something I actually buy sometimes. A very broad market thing. It's a shame because I already invested all the money I am willing to invest in bitcoin *as* an investment. Now I'm waiting for shops to accept my bitcoin so I have incentive to replenish my spending wallet. I even considered buying some stuff at overstock from overseas to support the company, but at that time they didn't yet allow bitcoin purchases from abroad...

What is fair value according to you and what ways do you use to measure it?
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:11:46


Yes, but hopefully after seeing their kids off to a good college. Having lived a for filling life, maybe in a good neighborhood and enjoying a nice pension with some to spare for a couple of nice vacations perhaps.
No argument here for the "foolish" investor, for he has a bigger chance to have none of these things and will die eventually as well.

Perhaps you're right. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:42:53
I wonder: Does it matter?
I mean, if businesses are accepting it and increasingly people are using it, what does it really matter that the value is measured in dollars? I'm not an economist and would like to know an explanation.
Furthermore what does it matter that businesses at this point are converting to fiat currencies? Won't the price go up because *customers* are buying bitcoins and holding a part of them while only spending certain amounts of it at a time?
If the technology has clear benefits and adoption is happening, will there be a point at which it runs into 'problems' or something because of this?

"Only invest what you can afford to lose"
Is utterly bullshit advice anyway. The gambler will always make poor choices in this regard. It's an empty phrase.  *Real* investors have a percentage of their assets that they are willing to put in the stock market and allocatie to assets of different risk levels. And that percentage will not change. "What you can afford/are willing to lose" is playing dice with your greed on the other side of the table. And greed will win most of the time. People have terrible judgement and make terrible and unintelligent choices when they are greedy. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 14:26:53
You (and the guys at are completely right.
At that stage (and still now) bitcoin was a completely speculative gamble. It was and still is an 'investment' that is completely covered by thick clouds of the unknown future with little proof of concept and market. There is very little predictability and it is *not* at this time, and especially wasn't back than, a solid value investment. It's still a highly risky asset. 
Any reasonable, smart, *investor* would realize this and allocate a part of his assets that is *appropriate* for that sort of risk level. This should probably never be more than about 10% of total assets.
A good investor shows himself after a lifetime of investment choices. People can get lucky, but that luck tends to be cancelled out over the long run. 
They were utterly right to point this out to him.

Am I right that I cannot pay with bitcoin at overstock if I'm an international customer?
I'm from The Netherlands and want to buy something with Overstock to support them for supporting bitcoin but my payment options seem only to be credit card/paypal.

I would recommend you to read this before you start replacing all of your diet with this powder: [examine soylent](
Perhaps your diet is bad because of a tendency to take the "easy road" when it comes to food? And instead of grabbing the nearest powder to make up for not eating right, as another quick and easy fix, focus on building some new, healthy habits like eating some fruits, vegetables and unprocessed foods, learn to cook a good meal. Perhaps start exercising if you haven't already?
Agreed, this may be a bit harder than downing some powder a couple of times a day. But this is going to *actually* make your life better. As opposed to feeding yourself on illusions.

People that invest all of their savings in such a high risk asset will have lost their savings sooner or later anyway. Their character doesn't suddenly change overnight, these people are gamblers that have not realized that it's not smart for them to go to the casino with a credit card on hand.
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:54:18
Totally different really.
So people cannot talk about their good fortune anymore because it's immediately bragging and gives people the direct moral right to take you down when the chips are down? This is a pathetic slave morality.
Unless you have been excessively talking about it, 'bragging' about your investments just implies jealousy on the other side that is expressed through them poking fun at you for losing. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 17:25:21
That and because bitcoin is not stable enough to be used as a (mainstream) currency and measure of value/unit of accounting at this time. And it will take quite a bit of time, years, before it is on a level where it can function in this regard. And because of this, adoption will also take time (a sort of feedback loop..) More time than a lot of bitcoin enthousiasts probably imagine.
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:53:19

This is the problem. Dogecoin isn't all serious because it isn't serious and à real currency is serious because people's lives and futures depend on it. 
I have nothing against dogecoin, but the "all fun and games disarming free exchange, this is how crypto is supposed to be" keeps it à game played with pocket change, excess wealth western youths have plenty of (eventhough economic insecurity and student debt..etc. If you can afford your iPhone with à laté at starbucks while you complain about your debt ridden life you're horribly wealthy compared to 80% of the world).  The playfulness is fine ofcourse but it's not an argument against something of a more serious nature.
Perhaps the bitcoin community needs à bit of an attitude change, perhaps not. 80% of posts in this sub are enthousiastic news about bitcoin being accepted somewhere or the like. I have yet to see a bitter community full of greedy haters.
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:23:56
That actually surprises me a bit. Still so small but a whopping 60% has heard of it.
@_date: 2014-02-04 13:25:12
At the outset it is the same. But it has aspirations that are more serious and could have major implications for the non-western world as well. Major implications that can only be reached with a currency that is "serious" and not just an internet fancy.

I think this is very true. 'Hassle' is the main thing standing in the way of a large increase in overall donations. It only takes a little hassle to put a large amount of people off of it. At least this is what I think and personally notice in myself.

Do people who go to the casino and waste their childrens college education deserve our sympathy? 
I feel bad for everyone who lost money there *but* the people who gambled away their life savings. They would have lost their savings anyway for they are no more than gamblers that went to the casino with a credit card on hand. Who puts all their savings into one exchange betting it all on one very high risk asset?
I am not sympathetic for sheer stupidity.

What can one expect from five year old technology that's only *just* been getting mainstream media attention? 


Adoption rate has not slowed in any way as far as I know so this doesn't hold up at this point.
Furthermore this doesn't seem to be an argument. People will use dollars/euros as a measure of value because that is what *all* products and services and their paycheck are measured in. *Ofcourse* bitcoin is not a general measure of value (yet). But again, what does it matter?
@_date: 2014-03-05 11:47:42


The 'community' is an aggregate of people who share quite a loose tie through a common interest. Most of these people probably didn't have money in Gox and thus haven't lost anything. This 'community' just resumes business as usual after an event that caused bad press for bitcoin and maybe a little bit of sympathy for those who did lose money.
I think there's nothing either admirable or weird about it. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 01:21:54

@_date: 2014-08-08 09:41:59
Exactly. Ofcourse 'bitcoiners' are going to be excited by the news of a company accepting bitcoin and be driven to buy something there to support it. But people forget the relatively tiny group of people that actually own *and* spend bitcoins. It cannot sustain those large order volumes.
This has nothing to do with the interest waning or anything else, just with the size of bitcoin at the moment.
Furthermore small businesses have to realize that the fact that they may have gotten orders in the beginning when they just started accepting but very little afterwards is because they operate in a niche market. A niche currency will not support a niche market. People who would not ordinarily buy your product at all may have just given you some sales because of the news you accepted bitcoin, but they will not suddenly start buying 'custom male grooming products from Belgium' when they didn't in the past. 
People need to have a little more realistic expectations at this point.

So basically the players and factions that are able to pump the largest amount of money into the game will come to dominate as all the players that play to earn some doge will be producing for the players that pay the most. I suspect that large clans/factions will start asking their members for regular monetary contributions to support the faction.
This game will effectively become a micro economy of its own that will vacuum up money from the 'real world'.

Your 2 cents are pretty worthless. 
The fact that you haven't had any security issues is educational to no one. 
The fact that it's 'people's own fault' that their coins get lost or stolen doesn't make it any less of an obstacle for mainstream adoption and it doesn't make the currency any easier to use. Instead of threads like this we need people thinking about ways this can be improved.
Thanks for the worthless post.
