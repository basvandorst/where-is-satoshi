Not who you replied to but I also have a similar question.  I bought a small amount of BTC ($10) on Coinbase and wanted to transfer it to my electrum wallet.  I started the transfer from Coinbase and noticed if said it would take about half of he total BTC for the transaction from the exchange to my wallet. Is that normal and if so how can I be sure the coins transfer to the right wallet the first time?  I've read other places you want to firs transfer small amounts and then the rest once you know it will go through.  
In addition, if I have a hardware wallet coming in a week or so, should I just wait and use that or would the fees still be the same?

Any word on KeepKey getting this?

Awesome thanks for the reply!

So that being the case does it make sense to transfer purchases to cold storage whenever they are purchased just to get them out of third parties? Or would the fees make that unviable?

Sorry I still don't follow this entirely.  So say I buy 1 BTC with fiat and have that either in an exchange.  Is consolidation only really coming into play once I've done numerous additional transactions so that maybe I have a variety of altcoins and BTC on multiple exchanges or wallets?  Because otherwise I'm just seeing that no matter what I exchange or buy between currencies on a single exchange it stores the BTC in the same address.

This may be the wrong place to ask, but can someone explain what consolidation is?  I keep hearing this thrown around but wasn't sure.  Is it when people have various coins of smaller values spread around multiple exchanges and they pick a time like now to put them into one wallet to get the least fees?

As someone fairly new to this, do you recommend logging all of your transactions down to that level of detail?  Not sure if it is important to log everything unless you're invested in a bunch of different coins but curious what your thoughts are on this.

Ah, makes sense and I appreciate the explanation!  Sounds like it's an issue that people who transfer a lot of transactions directly to their wallet have to deal with but looking forward to that fix eventually.

Not OP but would GDAX charge for transferring from their exchange to cold storage?  Or would this just be the regular flat fee across the network? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:51:28
Got it, sounds like it's worth consolidating if you have enough transactions in a single wallet and the fees are low.  Now I know I'm going to regret having to see my 0.000001 BTC as a separate transaction when I wanted to test the transfer lol

You seem to know a lot about Iota so I’m hoping you can answer my question.  I understand the underlying technology and definitely think it’s an interesting project (will likely be investing in the near future).  But my question is why is the current price of Iota not seen as extremely overvalued given the total number of Iota available?  Correct me if I’m wrong, but aren’t there 98 billion or so Iota that will exist?  Comparing to other coins in the market right now I.e ripple why is the price of Iota so high?

Thanks for the video, that was exactly what I was looking for.  In the video they state that one “I” is $0.000035 or something like that.  Is that because the video is old and the value has gone up now to $0.88 at the time of writing this?
