You would be the only "economist" in the world suggesting that a deflationary currency "works". Well then genius, how is your deflationary currency going to account for population growth? It won't. Deflationary currency induces economic environments where the first generation takes all and everyone born after that is fucked in the asshole. Deflationary currency is a wet dream for those who seek to gain power over the system and over others who didn't move first. Deflationary currency never worked, and will never work. Not one single country in the world has a deflationary currency anymore and not one will ever go back because we are smarter now. "We" being me and the whole world, not you.

More like 100 million. Don't you think there would be exchanges all over the U.S. if all it took was a million dollars? Of course there would be. But in reality you'd need 50-100 million seed capital just to meet regulatory compliance. Only western union and moneygram seem to be able to afford it at the moment.

They are selling "gold producing" machines. That's a bit different. Among professionals, this is one of the biggest red flags about bitcoin. Why would anyone produce minting machines and sell them if they believe that  the end user will profit more than the price of the machine? Either the asic makers are selling hardware that they know will make a loss for their customer, or they are just being good citizens and allowing everyone to make free money. I don't think it's the latter. Plus it suggests that they don't see a long term potential in their own asics if they sell them right off the assembly line.
History will laugh at bitcoin.

I don't agree with the term slavery, but I do agree with his characterization that bitcoin operates in a cultish environment where one must surrender all criticisms in order to accept the "faith" of bitcoin. Just like any cult characterizes all powerful institutions as "evil", so have the bitcoiners characterized all powerful institutions as "evil". Bitcoin is a faith, no different than scientology. Bitcoiners will evangelize their friends and families to fucking death, just like a new found cult member would.

Think about how naive op is to think that some white knight will come along and want to assume hundreds of millions in liabilities and invest in this glorious brand name...yeah, right...if this isn't full on delusions then I don't know what is. Why don't they still use Lehman bros brand on wall st? Because the brand stands for failure, that's why. Gox stands for failure and nobody would invest one fucking nickel in such a  brand. That is why if they announce a "takeover" you can bet your ass that it is a shell game with the old owners simply reincorporating under a new name, just like blackwater has done three or four times now.

currencies are always traded in pairs, because that is how you derive its value by pairing it with another currency. If all fiats failed then of course bitcoin would fail too because bitcoins value is always stated in dollars or euros or whatever. BTC would fail quicker than everything.

Nobody is going to carry you shitcoins for you. Either their is utility there or there is no utility there. Marketing and persuasion don't carry technologies into the future. Google didn't become google by persuading people to use their service. Google has massive utility so people organically used it until it reached full saturation.

I can't. So because *your* dad likes bitcoins, that means that wide-spread adoption is right around the corner? Don't think so. People don't care for a currency that comes with a 50 page manual of instructions on how to maintain and use it. Bitcoin will never be mainstream. Never. And if you cannot see this, then you most certainly have drunk the kool-aid the moment you bought into it. You cannot will btc into being popular. And the more you guys yell from the mountain tops, the more you guys look like a desperate lot. How many people had to be convinced to use google? None. If there is great utility with new technology, then wide-spread adoption falls in line immediately. Btc has no real fundamental utility that cannot be served by existing infrastructure.

So when gox was priced above the market, it was ok to include them in the average because it brought the average up. But now that gox is priced below market, suddenly there is a rush to get rid of the anchor that is pulling the average down.

nice propaganda L Ron. If you need to make post after post because you are attempting to "talk up" the market...then you should take a look in the fucking mirror and realize its over. Doesn't the fact that you are trying to persuade strangers to buy into btc point to the fact that bitcoin does not lend itself to self description? Organic natural growth in btc is completely over as now all I see is shills and shills selling btc over and over. BTC IS DEAD and your shitty selling technique is proof of its death.

Dude, think about it.

There is only ONE reason a financial institution would risk their reputation by not paying...and that one reason is BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. Of course they have been insolvent for a long time. Bitcoiners loved the fact that they were insolvent as long as the gox price raised the average price much higher, but everyone got butthurt when gox prices fell and dragged the average down.

Right, cause it's ok for an exchange to snipe accounts that don't use 2FA? If it could be any clearer than the day is long, exchanges will steal your bitcoins if you don't use a third party 2FA system because they can't hack your account then. The exchanges are the criminals. 
You wanted to support a non-regulated security, well, now you got it. Have fun trying to track down your funds in the unregulated bitcoin world.

Here is your cult attitude...*if you don't use bitcoin its because you don't "get it" yet and don't realize its going to take over the world* . You automatically assume all critics to be just uninformed, as if they all would adopt btc if they just learned more about it. WRONG. You are in a cult mindset and only see what you want to see.
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:05:30
The biggest barrier is simply that bitcoin IS too complicated for most people to use. People simply get turned off when they hear all the techie-babble that is "required" to learn so you can securely store and use bitcoins. It simply will never work because people will still choose to swipe a card or pay in fiat cash.

Why don't you "fight corruption" and empower those who've lost money at mt gox? Unregulated exchanges are as corrupt as anything we've ever seen in the financial industry. Withdrawal delays everywhere are getting longer and longer with new hoops to jump through added weekly.

USD cannot be a ponzi as no true ponzi scheme owns it's own currency printing press.

That is the truth and you can choose to believe it or not, but your perception doesn't change the consensus reality shared by market participants.

no market ever moves in one direction for any length of time, ever. Go back and look at any major crash and you will see that it didn't happen overnight. A crash is a slow motion event that only looks like a crash in hindsight. Bitcoin's 90 day average is markedly pointed downward. For over 90 days bitcoin has not gained a cent. What happens in the short term is anyones guess but the fact remains that until bitcoin climbs above 1000 again, you will never see regular folks jump in again.

bitcoin needs to interface with banks in order to operate. If banks refuse to cooperate, then it is game over. Other p2p technology, such as bittorrent, do not depend on the banking system or any other system in order to function. Bitcoins weakness is that most banks in the world will be under pressure to not participate.

BTC has fundamentals? Uncorroborated non-quantifiable nonsense stats that don't mean dick to anyone who doesn't suffer confirmation biases does not count as a sort of fundamental. The only thing fundamental about bitcoin is that its going to revert back to its $13 price for one year ago. No security ever goes up 500x in a year without falling back hard!

Saying "never" suggests you are developing a psychological blind-spot and is very dangerous attitude for any trader or investor to take on. Be careful during the next crash as you will might find yourself stuck in a burning building all the while you'll be sticking to your arbitrary made-up price floor. Just because you want the price to stick, doesn't make it so. Markets do as they wish and you don't control that.

Do you understand what the word "short" means in finance? Obviously not. I keep hearing bitcoiners say "to short bitcoin, just sell then buy back"...yeah, that's not called going short, that's called closing a position and opening a new position. Going short means at least NEGATIVE 1 (-1). You have to be SHORT at least one share. You cannot sell something you do not have so you MUST BORROW shares from somebody with a positive position.
You cannot short bitcoin.
I can't even believe I'm explaining this out to you. This should be fucking obvious as obvious gets.

By your logic I should invest in real estate companies if I want my real estate holdings to appreciate in value. Your logic is faulty. You cannot just say that investing in bitcoin infrastructure will "necessitate" the increase in bitcoins value. Bitcoins value is only derived from a small pool of ultra-high risk takers. That pool of market participants will never get any larger because there just isn't that many people willing to put one cent into an unregulated security. $1000 is most definitely the top of the market. Bitcoin's market will never attract more than a few billion dollars. Never. Invest in infrastructure all you want, but unless you can decrease the risk aversion that 99% of regular people have, bitcoin will never be the great savior that you think it is. Or any other cryptocurrency for that matter.

Google didn't need better pr. Youtube didn't need better pr. Bittorrent didn't need better pr. WHY? Because they all offered a utility that was supreme and so it sold itself without the need for commercials or advertising or marketing whatsoever. And bitcoin? Is it not obvious this technology will never take off because the idea of it needs to be "sold" to  people? Do you not get this. The market isn't demanding bitcoins, its rejecting it by virtue of not adopting it. I know what you are thinking: *"But, but, give it more time plz!!"*...5 years is an eternity in tech-years. BTC is finished because it has reached its peak adoption rate already.
@_date: 2014-02-19 13:12:44
So you guys still think that bitcoin will have widespread adoption? Even though you are all admitting that most people will never "get it".

Of course  some people will spend some bitcoins. If you are suggesting that most people invested in bitcoin are not there for the long term profit, then you are wrong. Why else would the early adopters take the risk of buying into a new currency if there wasn't a profit motive. The majority of holders are all long biased at this point.
Also many are spending their coin because they worry about another crash and there is no easy way to withdraw an amount like $50,000 from any exchange, so they spend the coin and let someone else deal with that problem while avoiding any future losses in a potential crash. A lambo is an asset which can be liquidated much easier than bitcoins.

I agree with point 1. I don't agree with point 2. Adding "another function" to an SHA256 does nothing to solve the problem of SHA256 becoming insecure by known attack vectors. The blockchain would have to be upgraded to SHA3, which requires a brand new blockchain. 
Nobody knows where the collisions are yet. With a hash like **9595c9df90075148eb06860365df33584b75bff782a510c6cd4883a419833d50** there are 64 characters for a total of 4,126,620,254,
929,080,114,319,413,364 possible combinations. And in that big number surely is many, many collisions. So randomly doing double-round hashes  *could* sort you a private key via random guess or even a collision. It *could* take you a billion years, but it IS within the probabilities that someone could stumble into a key within a short time, not likely, but certainly possible. 
The bottom line is SHA256 is on it's way out, and won't be secure for long. That should make all bitcoin holders concerned.

If you argue that bitcoin is currency that the government cannot have control of, then argue that banks should be forced to accept bitcoin, you are arguing that it is your right to access a money laundry. There are laws that penalize banks for allowing clients to use their facilities to  buy and sell untraceable assets. 
So they have a right to prevent their own penalization, and the government is happy that they closed another laundry/tax loophole. This is not class action stuff, not even close.

Cash transactions are anonymous, but only to a certain point. Let's say you walk into a yacht dealer in the U.S. and buy a yacht with 5 million cash. When the yacht dealer goes to their bank to deposit said cash, it will trigger an IRS flag and it will be investigated: "Who did you sell the yacht to?" they will surely ask. Using threats of penalties, any business owner will gladly tell the authorities anything they want to know. Sure you can buy a pack of cigs completely anonymously, but you cannot move large amounts of cash without it getting flagged at some point in the transaction chain. It's the classic drug dealer problem, what to do with a million dollars in drug money? Buy a house? With cash? Good luck! 
Any business that uses a bank account IS within the anti-money laundering system no matter if the business deals mostly in cash or otherwise. Investigation flags occur with any deposits that deviate from established normal patterns.

The downfall is 100% guaranteed over the next 5-10 years as the SHA2 protocol is cracked. Take a look at this list [ and you'll notice that SHA256 (the encryption algo used in bitcoin) is up next to be broken. When SHA2 becomes insecure, SHA3 will be needed. The problem with that is that the blockchain will have to be started from scratch when SHA3 needs to be implemented. And someday in the next few decades SHA3 will be broken. There is no way around these facts. Most bitcoin holders pretend to understand cryptography, but fail miserable because they're fanatics who only want to hear their own idealized fantasies parroted back to them.
Once bitcoins are totally worthless when SHA2 goes down, not many people are going to be that eager to throw money at the next cryptocurrency because cryptocurrencies are based on cryptographic standards that **always** will be cracked given any length of time. I don't see cryptocurrencies having any future in the long run.

To win the lottery, the odds are so long that you are more likely to get bit by a swimming pig in the pacific ocean. Yet someone always wins the lottery every week. Technically speaking, you are correct in thinking that it would take a bajillion years to find the hash, if iterating from random sets. But someone generating a random walk hash of hashes could still find the private key they are looking for. Someone will win this lottery too. Imagine getting satoshi's key? Oh man, that certainly would be worth "mining"  for, even if it took a year or two.
But that is not the biggest fundamental problem with bitcoin. It's this: SHA2 will be cracked sometime between now and the next 5 years.

What good does an average do when exchanges are quoting prices varying by 10%+? 
The bitcoin market is full of friction. You should be able to arbitrage out price differences between the exchanges, but there are arbitrary transfer and withdrawal delays imposed by exchanges that are hindering fluidity of the market. Bitcoin needs to mature much more before anyone will take it seriously as a currency and not just a speculative commodity. 
The market will be mature when you can deposit $100,000 with an exchange, and turn around the next day and request a withdrawal for $100,000, and actually get it all at once . That just isn't possible with any exchange today and that is very worrying because the upward bias on bitcoin pricing may be somewhat due to "trapped" or "throttled" money in the exchanges.

Difficulty only increases if you are trying to calculate the hash. If you are generating hashes willy nilly via random iteration then it cannot be said that difficulty is increasing.

If it's sooo easy, then the question is Why aren't you going down to the bank to get this easy money too? It's because those loans for yogurt shops or whatever are backed by collateral...home equity, stocks, bonds, equipment. Banks aren't just going to give out money willy nilly and take on all the risk.

Nice cover story. I get it, it sucks to lose shit loads of money, and that is what OP is doing. Looking to "talk up" the market is not going to work if the risk bearing is at a threshold.

Maybe he believes in "the secret" LOL. Yeah, cause all those millions of children around the world that die each year of starvation are at fault because they weren't "wishing" correctly apparently. 
I don't know how people truly believe they can will things into existence through desire alone.

Not to mention this is outrageously complicated for your average Internet user to complete. Bitcoin adoption isn't going anywhere as long as this extreme friction exists between bitcoin and the banking institutions.

I'm sure most are going to risk riding it out for a few more weeks in the hope that the market has a sudden upward spike. It is likely many are sitting on positions that are losing. You can bet your ass that *sometime* before Jan 31 2014 there will be a hell storm firesale on BTChina.

You sound like a scientologist. "Keep your problems with us  quiet. Nobody needs to know how bad we are fucking you over"
You don't get to manage a 100% bullish presentation of bitcoin to the world. Warts and all, the bitcoin ecosystem needs to be critical evaluated in public. If these many problems persist, bitcoin is doomed.
Many in this sub are feeling a strong sense of annoyance at any critical comment, not because the volume of negativity is increasing, but because you are all starting to entertain the thought that bitcoin may not be all it's cracked up to be. That feeling of annoyance is your dissonance. Which is a good thing because many of the fanatics need a wakeup call. 
Bitcoin is subject to the same bubble mentality that any other brand new technology is subject to. Bitcoin wasn't the first technology to appear to be the savior of the world, and won't be the last.

Nobody knows what satoshi intended. He might be an evil genius who designed the bitcoin with the intention that the miners themselves will discover hash collisions thus cracking the SHA2 algo.

Can't wait to see grandma start using bitcoins. Oops, there goes 500 grand. 
But, I know, we should be blaming the victim here, right? It's all his fault, right? If it were a bank wire, he could reverse it, but it's not, it's fucking bitcoins. Bitcoin is so secure that it is insecure. Like adding 50 locks on all windows and doors, everyone dies in a fire because they can't get out in time. Bitcoin's "security" is an illusion if you are OP.

He's attempting to reframe the concept of "money" as a subject that is now entirely encapsulated within a new "internet" named "bitcoin".  His argument is that bitcoin&gt;money, which is a sentiment I do not share.

China is de facto banning bitcoin. After Jan 31 2014, chinese people cannot move money to or from an exchange and that is the real truth [

China has lead the downturn. All exchanges have been following China's lead. Just look at the price at btchina, and you'll see the price that the other exchange will migrate to. Look out for this falling knife!!

You're talking out your ass. In 2008, the U.S. markets destroyed over 11 trillion in wealth. All those trillions that the fed is bringing down fills that 11 trillion hole. Inflation IS at records lows you idiot. Take a basket of goods: How much did they cost last year? How much do they cost this year? The difference is inflation. Is a can of coca-cola $25? No. Inflation is just over 1% right where Bernanke said he was going to bring it.

Except cryptocurrencies are secured and bound by the algorithm they are constructed with. In bitcoins case, it's the SHA2 algorithm. Algorithms will always be cracked and become useless for cryptography. While a decentralized network like bittorrent isn't hinging on any specific algorithms to function. When SHA2 becomes useless (any time now) the blockchain must be started from scratch using the next algo which is SHA3. 
Comparing P2P systems with the bitcoin network is a fallacy. The devil is always in the details.

Dude, you don't know what the fuck you are talking about. Do you understand what "hedging" means? Like, at all? No serious player will ever become involved in bitcoin because not only are there no fundamentals to analyze, and there is no fucking way to hedge out your risk. So "shorting, insurance" are for "gamblers who don't know better"? Ok then. Call the derivatives markets and tell them to shut out the lights because farmers no longer need instruments to insure or hedge against crop destruction because being a farmer is being a gambler and if you are a farmer you don't know any better.
You just simply do not have any handle how the fucking world works and the reasoning behind it.

Bitcoin doesn't even need to die for this to occur. If bitcoins continue to rise is value, it will become very lucrative for miners to search for collisions that produce a private key to a big wallet. What else would you do with giant hash generating machines?
It goes without saying that sha2 will be cracked, and then sha3.....and on and on. History proves this to be the reality. Bitcoin would never survive a sha2 compromising event. And moving bitcoin to sha3 would necessitate  starting a new blockchain from scratch (bye bye version 1 bitcoin holders!), and then you would have to ask people to trust again even though sha3 cracks will be right around the corner. 
IMO I don't believe any one crypto-currency can ever become a functionally secure currency over a long period of time (15 years+). Get out while it's hot is my only advice.

Historically, holding your bitcoins is much more rewarding than spending them. I would say the "disincentive to spending" remains in place, as long as this pattern continues to reward long term holders.

Because exchanges can do whatever the fuck they want with your money and they don't have to answer to anybody. No regulators, no laws = exchanges fucking their customers over because who's going to stop them. For most people, suing a foreign corporation is impossible unless you are a filthy rich millionaire. Exchanges have up and disappeared completely before, and what did anyone do about it? Write an angry blog post? 
Once you send money to an exchange, count that money as lost forever because they are not legally obligated to give you anything back.
