Here's the oldest one 
@_date: 2013-10-20 08:01:02

@_date: 2013-11-23 15:40:55
cctv is also obsessed with Bitcoin recently

@_date: 2013-12-04 15:19:22
found a stream 
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:12:57
This one means much more to general public than the small jiasule service
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:33:15
Baidu adds this page today  Alexa top 5 in China
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:02:54
That's really great! I decide to try your service for one of my tracks now.  I'm not a professional musician, if you don't mind... Reading the upload instructions now. I think I need to make some adaption. Just wait one or two days.

I don't know what 人民网 is doing
@_date: 2013-12-24 23:10:41
same problem here
@_date: 2013-03-03 16:50:30
You can use google translate  it's not that long, but hard to read maybe, sorry about that, no time to translate myself
@_date: 2013-05-06 10:16:56
because the character 发 could mean both “send” and "hair" in Simplified Chinese.
@_date: 2013-02-16 21:22:09
me too
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:22:53
I pointed it out at the same day Baidu stopped accetping bitcoin but seems no one noticed it, probably because of my bad English. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:57:10
I'm native Chinese. I confirm it's a very bad news. The rumor is true. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:16:18
Yi Gang, the deputy governor of China's central bank, said that the People's Bank of China will not admit the legitimacy of bitcoins in the short term, during a forum on November 20, 2013. However, Yi admitted that bitcoin is an "interesting" and "inspirational" development and added that he will personally focus on the virtual currency's future.

sorry, my bad English. This site (hao123.com) is ranking top 5 in China. It belongs to Baidu. It's like an index of many useful websites. Many people set it as homepage when open browser. There is also an English version of this site you can read it here.  At the same day baidu stopped accepting bitcoin, they added "bitcoin" (Chinese: 比特币) into this page  hao123.com , just in the finance section, in the same row with hedge fund and stock market.
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:59:45
It's not good at all. It's government behind.
@_date: 2013-05-06 10:18:30
@_date: 2013-03-03 17:09:23
Interested part is what Chinese police think bitcoin to be. According to past cases, they are not interested in small amout of virtual property stolen
@_date: 2013-12-24 23:40:31
Got this from support:
"Hey, unfortunately we are only able to accept orders under $100 using Bitcoin, we're looking to extend this early next year - in the meantime feel free to place multiple smaller orders to get round this.
Apologies for the inconvenience, and seasons greetings!"
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:49:45
He's BTCChina CEO
@_date: 2013-04-02 09:41:48
They should sign that page using that address
@_date: 2013-03-03 17:01:02
AFAIU, 200BTC lost is due to some data error before the hack, not this time. Even though the amount is not quite big, the funds of some people I know have just been frozen there and can't move out until the case is solved by police and who know when. This caused lots of trouble
@_date: 2013-02-06 20:29:38
Why no Japan?
@_date: 2013-02-22 16:43:12
you mean btcnCNY?
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:46:18
