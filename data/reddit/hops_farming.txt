No this miner chose to create only 49. 99.. Btc instead of the 50 the protocol allows, that one Satoshi can never be recovered or created in another block, even if every possible private key is generated and checked. The counter party proof of burn is a different thing entirely and is technically recoverable even if the chances are astronomically tiny.

well theyd need to start from the block before, and get consensus from users that their chain was the true bitcoin

He means network as in the bitcoin network, not the cell network connection or internet connection. He didn't answer your question but the opposite of how does the smartphone provide benefit to bitcoin.
Conceivably the benefit to having something like this integrated in the phone is for when/if crypto transactions become more mainstream, using your phone as your hardware crypto wallet to pay for transactions similar to how applepay/samsung pay etc work currently

This doesnt reduce the amount of transactions per block, it just reduces the amount of signature data outside the block. With segwit we have 1mb of block data and ~.8-1mb of witness data in the optimum. The claim hes making is it would reduce the .8-1mb of witness data. So less data would need to be transfered for the same amount of transactions, no decrease in transactions.

That's a correct understanding, these signature proposals would just then shrink the size of the extra signature data. Meaning you still get the same number of transactions as now but with less total data (block+signatures) having to be relayed over the network

Two people. Send private key + message saying "on X date i will make a transaction, send a double spend transaction at some time after that"

The optimum meaning with everyone/majority of users using segwit. If users create nonsegwit transactions then there is no benefit to this extra space outside of the 1mb block. These are the optimal conditions do take full advantage of segwit
@_date: 2018-06-26 09:13:04
Currently with segwit there is still the 1mb block size but additional signature data that brings the amount of data per block, to ~2mb. Their claim of signatures taking 1 space means the additional 1mb of signature data would be near 0, so only 1mb of data per block, but the same transaction count per block as currently.

Higher throughput is a priority and among almost all developers lightning / other 2nd layer solutions are seen to be the solution, because there are unavoidable problems with scaling blocks indefinitely. Having signature space reduced via other signature types could in the future lead to a more realistic increase in block size, since the average case block + signature size wont be as large.
There isn't one central group deciding the priorities of Bitcoin development. There's many different individuals and groups working on different projects. Not everyone has the skill set or passion to work on 2nd layer/lightning development, but do have the skills and passion to work on a different aspect. All different aspects of development help to move the project forward.

It is practically impossible to guess a specific key, but it is not impossible. There is a tiny tiny chance you will do it, but the odds are so incredible small that for all intents and purposes it may as well be impossible.

neither of these graphs have a log scale
