The volume isnt fake, everybody in Korea is in crypto
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:52:00
I mean exchange volume not tx throughput
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:44:47
they can take the futures that say btc will be lower, AND THEN LITERALLY MAKE THE PRICE LOWER BY SELLING BTC THEY ALREADY OWN
it is free money. you can crash the market with 5k btc easily. jpmorgan probably has way more than that

Show me anywhere the irs says this about crypto. You can't, it's pure speculation.

"The financial authorities [in SK] have decided to declare exchanges illegal, where the exchanges are buying and selling virtual currency such as bitcoin. If they are following certain consumer protection rules, exceptions will be made. The Financial Authority personally decides on a case-by-case basis whether a given exchange is following these rules, notifying law enforcement if they're not being followed."
Asked a friend to translate it for me

This is seperate, they appeared on tv today to talk about this. futures were banned yesterday. READ THE ACTUAL KOREAN SOURCE ARTICLE. FUTURES ARE NOT MENTIONED. THIS IS NOT ABOUT FUTURES
"Other government officials also said, "It is government's intention to eradicate speculation by making transactions uncomfortable, even if it is not a total ban." He added, "We will adjust the differences between the ministries and give them a regulation next week." In this regard, the Ministry of Justice, which leads the Virtual Currency Task Force (TF), focuses on the legal basis to stop the operation of the virtual currency exchange. An official from the Ministry of Justice said, "If the exchange registered as an online telecommunication dealer hurts investors, it can be canceled.""

they already bought btc, they will short with that existing btc, and then go short with their futures. They manipulate the price down so they win their bet
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:38:53

@_date: 2017-12-08 12:56:44
They are considering it. When China did this it was the exact same, then they did it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:54:21
Futures already were banned, the government spoke on TV today about FULLY banning crypto as to many people are losing their savings by buying high 


@_date: 2017-12-08 13:13:09
Right? This sub is fucking delusional
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:55:47
Binance is the best exchange

@_date: 2017-12-07 10:58:56
Big if true
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:56:14
Mathematical analysis ignores those factors, and works solely on price and volume.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:23:28
usd vol : 32%
jpy vol: 31%
this volume is mostly from the chinese actually as their exchanges are shut so they use japanese ones
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:25:45
found the guy who bought last week
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:43:14
You pay tax on the profit, when you realize them to fiat in your bank account, not per trade. It's at capital gains rate, which is not too bad in Canada.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:15:55
you saying it wont happen is just as much speculation
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:38:16
wall street buys OTC, and via places like nordnet which arent going to show up on coinmarketcap volume

@_date: 2017-08-14 17:23:48
Crypto is legitimately a massive ponzi with the whole human race involved
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:02:09

Login to tor on public wifi, sell all to xmr, transfer to new account.

@_date: 2017-11-27 03:32:59
like, you have the public address of it, but you only need to access it if you are withdrawing, and you would probably just withdraw a large amount at one time. I think it is extremely secure.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:53:15
i think it is a paper wallet, so you will have to break in to wherever they keep it :D
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:26:40
Moral of the story, mining is a scam and holding is better

just because things have slowed for 10 years, doesn't mean anything is over. a breakthrough can happen at any time

Inflation will destroy all currencies given enough time
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:27:16
you are fucked, they will turn it into monero and boom its gone
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:54:32
you can easily convert fiat &lt;-&gt; btc, so by your logic you should be all in on btc
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:53:34
you dont need a confirmation, I am pretty sure
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:49:34






literally the exact same
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:37:39
claiming moores law is finished is stupid. you don't know what advances in technology we might make to increase the speed of cpus. making smaller transistors is a dead end, but I am sure there are many many more methods we will discover that will push us further

Who do you think is buying the monero :)
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:10:53

 The fact that 1 green party hat is even obtainable by the average person, considering the finite supply and actual average wealth of individuals, is truly amazing and an opportunity of a lifetime. Don't miss out, own at LEAST 1 GREEN PARTY HAT and HODL like your financial future depends on it, because it does! You've been warned!

@_date: 2019-05-08 06:35:52
It is and always has been possible, but it's a lot of work to coordinate and the hacker can outbid the hackee for hash power
@_date: 2019-05-22 17:06:50
They denied this. They said it was 200k usd of btc not  200k btc
