I guess for every winner in a market there is an equal and opposite loser.

I find it crazy that the US gov are going after Localbitcoin traders like this. Shows they are scared IMO. If I lived in the US I would come support! Good Luck!

The main reason why millenials get into crypto is lack of trust in the current financial system so this does make sense. Good to be skeptical

Best to start with the oldest and most secure crypto than diving into untested and sometimes scam alts

The progression is so exciting! A new era for Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:04:02
Its definitely more volatile but putting 1-10% of your wealth in bitcoin is not financially irresponsible IMHO. It's a bonus that you can participate in a new paradigm of money

The stress of maintaining more than one identity would be too much for me! Let alone multiple

The next "Blockchain but not Bitcoin" I remember when this was all the rage in 2015

Such a brilliant thinker who writes excellently

True but its not easy to pick the winners amidst all this noise

No rest for Bitcoin!

I have to say I agree, there will be a real 'culling of the herd' and considering shitcoins have no fiat markets the likely route of these inflated market caps is into daddy bitcoin

I swear Forbes and Bloomberg switch between Bitcoin Moon and Bitcoin Doom every other article

Amazing that he could do that, Bitcoin's rich history is partly why I love it so much
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:07:56
Shame when stuff like this happens
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:09:32
Thats a shame, I hope that getting millennials into crypto would teach them more about finances. maybe this will be a valuable lesson to those that got burnt.

Is there a name for TA based on drawing pictures?? Anyone remember the dinosaur one, I can't find it for the life of me now

So exciting, having micro payments can push Bitcoin towards being a widely adopted medium of exchange
@_date: 2018-03-29 08:51:28
So exciting, I really hope to see some mainstream merchant adoption with Bitcoin thanks to lightning
