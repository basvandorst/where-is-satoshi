I tried posting this a second ago but I think it got deleted. We need to bring this to the forefront...
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:24:48
Basically the same thing with bitcoin. As the value goes up, we regress to the mean. But for a certain few, they're just taking profits on top of that. It seems like an infinite loop.
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:12:46
Going out on a limb here and saying you don't quite get the basics of supply and demand...
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:54:22
I'm trying to put it as simply as possible. If one person stops, the momentum slows down and we start to see the whole thing come down with it. Stopping is easier than starting it just requires less people to join in before it all comes to a stop. If that happens the price would plummet. Mark my words.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:11:54
I think some people are just not gonna get it.
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:15:30
And even then, there's not enough hashpower to get it all. Sorta seems doomed from the start...
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:52:40
The blockchain. Right now, you could say it's veering offtrack with everything that's going on, but we're just chugging along like it's no big deal. How close to derailing do we have to get before we do something?
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:29:40
I was just using apples as an example. Could be anything. Pens, purses, bitcoin etc....
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:17:51
Plus, getting 51% percent of all the coins is almost impossible by todays standard. As proven many times.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:13:28
Actually I know. I'm saying the effect of one person leaving the pool could cause that.
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:48:17
You're restating what I'm saying exactly.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:18:24
Tell that to Warren Buffett
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:10:15
What part doesn't make sense?
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:05:46
I'm not talking about the hashrate! It has nothing to do with what I'm saying.
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:33:32
How does bitcoin get from one node to the next without the natural inflation and not regressing to the mean?
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:24:47
You are begging the question
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:04:16
Yes. I'm american.
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:49:41
sorry. hashes. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:11:00
Were you using 2FA?
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:10:31
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:22:29
I don't understand why all the hate? It's like any time someone points out a flaw in the system, the evangelists step in and downvote. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:16:40
Yes, I know that. What I'm saying is because it's naturally defaltionary, we'll never get it all back on course without bringing out the big guns. But I don't think even G-Hash has the power to do that. Even if they did get 51%...
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:46:16
Blockchain is where all the transacations are recorded.
The blockchain prevents double spending by verifiying transactions with miners.
When you send coins to someone, the system uses your private key along with a secret message to someone elses public address. The miners confirm the transactions.
If on entity controls 51% of the hashing power of the bitcoin network, there is potential for double spending.
Bitcoin takes up no space really. Only the space it takes to store a sting of letters and numbers. You could store an infinite ammount on a DVD.
Two generals problem is a communication riddle. Two generals each on a different hill need to stage an attack but can cross the valley without giving themselves up. Bitcoin uses the blockchain and the signatures I was talking about before. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:12:38
Downvotes? Genuinely curious about this. This sub is only about good news.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:10:41
Which part?
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:50:04
That's great for that miner. But what about the rest of the world? How do they get it back?
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:46:53
I'm not a noob. I just know that if we don't get the problem fixed, I will repost this thread and laugh.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:34:25
That makes no sense
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:35:23
Not a troll. I tried posting and didn't get answers before it got buried. Nobody could agree on it...
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:58:32
That's a valid concern, but you have to look at the bigger picture. Think about this, if we had 100 people in a room and they all bought bitcoin, do you think they'd not notice? We just can't see any of that happen since it's on the internet.
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:55:43
Read up on bitcoin and come back to me.
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:03:02
Definitely not laughing. I'm invested along with all the rest and it's reaching a point of no return if we don't get on this soon. I wonder if we start a petition for added features we could turn this around. It's would take some good ideas, though.
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:51:31
Sort of. Just think about litecoin. We had that for a long time but it's still not as old as bitcoin. The older bitcoin gets, the older litecoin gets. THey will never reach parity. Now compare that to the blockchain. When you have something that just goes on forever, where does the REAL power come in. It's the same thing with the universe. Ever expanding.
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:40:45
Oh yea, sorry. I didnt say "TO THE MOON!" at the end. This sub astounds me.
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:14:53
It could be a 51% kind of thing, but we'll never know until all the coins are mined.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:34:39
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:54:36
Ha! Yea, okay. I think that's part of the problem. People refusing to believe that it's an issue until its too late.
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:27:08
What doesnt make sense to you. I cleared it up above.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:04:41
I'll come back to laugh when this all goes down and you didn't listen.
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:36:01
So would everybody else! They're just choosing to ignore it...
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:26:32
Sure but that one miner would have to carry the weight of the entire network. So let's say there's a million transactions in one day, but the hashrate is less that 1% of the volume. That would be enough to cripple the network and send bitcoin into a downward spiral while everyone is waiting for their money to go through.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:09:41
I'm not saying they're not public record, I'm saying we don't get the same market effect as if we were there in person. Some thing happened when the stock exchange went all digital.
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:45:27
Okay, but what about the rest of us? 
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:32:10
It's just like the supply and demand problem. We get more, we give more. How and when is it enough?
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:38:26
I'd glady keep the conversation going there I just mostly want to raise awareness. It seems like nobody has thought of this yet.
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:56:46
Yeah, except this puppy is realistic and not like the "to the mooners"
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:10:18
That's faulty logic. Google: Quantification Fallacy
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:45:49
it = the problem explained in my OP
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:37:48
It's not the problem anymore, I know that. But how do you solve the hashrate problem when there are so many people who dont give a shit?
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:21:43
Just earlier this morning we witnessed a massive dump. Maybe not massive by todays standards, but still. How does that get back in it without another firedrill? We just make the numbers up from Huobi?
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:49:16
Take a look at the pools. Look at the history on the charts. We've seen so much since January, that I doubt we'll ever get it back. THAT's the problem. It would take all the miners in the world to do that.
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:23:55
Okay, let me explain. If I had an apple and sold it for 3 dollars, that apple is worth 3 dollars. If someone else took that same apple and sold it for $10 dollars, they just turned a profit of 7 dollars did they not?
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:48:56
I've been learning about bitcoin since last January. It wasn't until recent that I recognized the problem and how big it is.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:03:08
It does matter. Mining is the backbone of the blockchain. Read up on this and then come back.
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:03:58
Not yet. But they will be when all the coins are mined. That's when we'll start to see the real issue. Google: confirmation bias.
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:47:54
Talk to any economist. They'll tell you the same thing. Nobody will exchange goods with you for more than they're worth.
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:49:29
Right. So if you use all of that up, you're not going to have anything left to spread. You start to stretch it too thin, you see what I mean?
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:28:17
Okay. Let's say you've got 20% of your money invested in bitcoin. If everyone decides to start selling, your value will go down. Supply and demand...
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:36:39
No. That problem has been solved. Transaction fees incentivize the miners. If anything, that's a good thing.
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:59:32
I don't mean it like that. I'm saying it's too high. Google: butterfly effect
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:06:48
Sorry, that was a little ambiguous. The blockrate @ 10 minutes per block is in general a good thing. But what if it faltered? Even just a little bit. Have you heard of the "butterfly effect"?
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:44:44
correct. We should be seeing more but now we're seeing less.
@_date: 2014-01-24 01:13:34
I think the only way to do it would be to fork the system, but that seems a little drastic. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:02:29
If there are 50 miners and only 2 people not mining, we'd run into this quicker than you're saying.
