My prediction is that it will probably still be where it's at, lol. I try not to get my hopes up..

I love how his first recommendation is "invest in real estate"... 
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:22:39
I'm not saying there's a rule against it, but strictly advising against owning crypto and instead invest in something that can be more risky seems like terrible advice for a "financial planner."

Don't worry guys, can confirm. Source: I sold my BTC yesterday to pay bills. So don't worry, you all enjoy it!

So should we start a funeral fund now or...?

BTC is the big and upcoming thing. People come by and tell people they can help them invest in it and get huge returns in X amount of time. They pay the schemer, he/she pockets more of the money than he/she should over the time span, just keeps getting more and more people, screwing them all out of their money. I can easily see this done with BTC.
  
(At least that's how I've always understood Ponzi schemes. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.)

I understood how versatile BTC was, but this honestly shook things up in my head a bit. I never really thought of it like this. You can literally purchase anything in the world from anywhere for someone and they'd never know the difference. No currency conversion, no crazy delays (okay, slightly debatable), just instant transfer of funds. Awesome stuff!
