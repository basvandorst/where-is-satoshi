The answer to the question you're asking is very complex. You literally cannot put enough BTC in to guarantee you'll have enough because BTC value could theoretically go to zero.
Because the future values of both coffee and bitcoin are unknown, the answer can only be presented in probabilistic terms. 
I've done all the math.
For 70% certainty plus or minus 5%, you'd need 0.6832 BTC today
For 90% certainty plus or minus 5%, you'd need 1.64 BTC today
For &gt; 99% certainty, you'd need ~5475.0 BTC today (live with 90% certainty)
**edit**: these numbers take into account your probable age and probable remaining lifespan as well as probable BTC and coffee prices (assumes you are a USA resident)

It's kind of strange being agreed with. That's why I love this community, a lot of us "get it". On most of the internet or Western world, price controls and a trusted 3rd party (benevolent government usually) are a no brainer.
Bitcoin has illuminated for a lot of people that having an entity "in charge" making sure things are "fair" isn't necessary, and is not in your personal best interest. That's why I feel obligated to take the time to explain.
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:04:26
No, it doesn't quite work like that. With 16.4 invested today, you can expect to spend a lot more than $30 every day from today with a certainty of 90%.
The reason is that BTC value is likely to increase by quite a bit over the course of years, so assuming you had 16.4 BTC today =~ 185k, if you spent $30 per day for the next 10 years you've only spent $110k worth of BTC. Even (this is very silly) assuming that reduced your BTC holdings according to today's prices, you still have over 6.5 BTC.
In 10 years, BTC price could easily be $250k each, so your 6.5 BTC remaining could be worth over $1.5 million. Assuming you've still got 70 years to live after that, you could be spending $50 daily at that valuation for the rest of your life.
I've left out a lot of details and greatly simplified the scenario, but rough estimate, if you did 16.4 BTC today, you'd probably have a 90% certainty that you could withdraw more like $60 worth or more daily for the rest of your life. Even though at today's price withdrawing $80 daily would exhaust your BTC in only ~8.5 years.
Of course, take it all with a grain of salt because these numbers are based off theoretical models which have never been proven "true" or applicable for something like cryptocurrency.

It's a little funny, but you know a handful (at least) of college kids genuinely did "invest" loaned money in BTC at $15k+
Hopefully they're HODLing and not panic selling. If they can hold for a few months they'll probably be fine. But if you're "investing" college loaned money I have to guess you might not have the backbone to hodl.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:15:36
I think you're generally right, and BTC and alts will remain depressed until we start seeing some utility. In this community, I think we all agree crypto is completely undervalued even at ATH, but we're basing that on future utility. Since the utility is only realized by those living with super-inflated fiat currently once the hype ran out it's less tangible to people not looking ahead.
Basically, everyone in this community and with a hodl mindset should be seeing today, and 7000, and 5000, and 3000, and 1000, and 500 and fantastic opportunities to increase BTC holdings because it will be worth dramatically more.
In fact, this is precisely why we're not at $5k yet. Because so many people are already aware of this. Currently, no, the utility in non-oppressive countries without massive inflation, what BTC actually is today does not justify even a $2000 valuation (IMO) but what it will be is priced in, and that's why we're at $10k, and we'd be at $20k if everyone "got it", but we had a lot of hype from people who don't get it, and they took profits and panic sold and here we are. 
A good buying opportunity.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:03:36
It isn't outrageous at all. They are completely playing by the rules and this is EXACTLY how BTC was intended to work.
They are trying to coerce higher fees by omitting the lower fee transactions. This should be expected, and the market solves the issue on its own. 
"Value" is fundamental, like gravity. No one gets to just decide to change it. AntPool doesn't get to decide how much transactions are worth, the can put a price on it, but that doesn't dictate value. Burger King *could* set a price of $50 for a Whopper, that doesn't change the value of the whopper. It's either worth it or it's not, regardless of the price.
Some transactions are valuable, to those issuing them, and those are the ones getting high fees associated with them. Others are not, and that's why AntPool's blocks aren't full. 
This is ok, and it's how the system ought to work. If the mempool continues to empty as it [has been]( AntPool will be mining empty blocks if it keeps this behavior up, and it will be self-harming. They'll be making block reward only when they could be making block reward plus fees. **If** they choose to do this long term, in time, a competitor(s) will push them out of business.
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:38:27


What principle?
It might not be intuitive, but it is perfectly normal, desirable, and efficient. In a free system everyone acts in their own best interest, and that is optimal.
AntPool is going to do what's in their best interest and what makes them the most money. This is good and desirable.
You do have a choice, and you DO vote with your wallet. IT IS AN ENTIRELY FREE system, and that is a good thing. What's good about it is that you and AntPool and Me are all subject to reality.
AntPool isn't stupid, they've made a calculated decision. They've said, look, we *believe* that the service we provide as a miner is worth X, and we're not going to mine transactions paying us less.
It's now up to you and me to decide whether they're right. We are completely free to issue transactions below X with the knowledge that since AntPool controls 18% of the hash power that there's an 18% chance our transaction does NOT make it into the next block. We **are** voting with our dollar and saying, NO, guaranteeing my transaction gets into THE NEXT block is NOT worth paying that premium.
Time will tell who is right. The mempool is in fact [emptying]( If it indeed empties, and AntPool continues this policy, they will be acting irrationally, which they're free to do, but they probably won't do it long.
Think of it this way, if the mempool is empty, I think that 90% of us are going to be paying the lowest possible fee to get our transaction confirmed. 10% of us might pay the premium to guarantee that if AntPool finds the next block that our transaction makes it in, but most of us won't. 80% of the time, the highest fee transactions will be added to a block generated by someone OTHER than AntPool. This means that every time AntPool mines a block leaving some of it empty, they're leaving cash on the table. (They're doing that now, but at least there's a non-empty mempool, they know that there is at least a waiting list to get tx in a block).
Over time, various mining operations are going to be adding more and more hardware and the profit margins for mining are going to decrease more and more. Eventually, AntPool will not be able to afford leaving transactions out. It'll be the difference between being profitable and not being profitable. They're just playing a gamblers game right now because they have wiggle room, they won't be able to forever, and it's ok that they are.
Also, pools are made up of contributors. Pools have different payout structures, but the fact is, a block with some empty room is worth less than a block that's filled up with transaction fees. What this means is that any AntPool competitor could theoretically copy AntPool's model EXACTLY, with the exception that they ARE willing to fill each block, and be more profitable. This means that competition is guaranteed to outperform AntPool. This isn't a good place to be and the market will correct it.
I hope this helps. Being free is a good thing. Even though it might appear inconvenient in the short term it's better for everyone in the long term.

I think it's mainly day traders. A lot of people bought around 9-10k a few days ago, watched it rise, now its on its way down. A lot of people made a lot of money, some people are making a little selling off now, others will take a loss selling now, hoping to buy back in lower. Rinse and repeat.
Just make sure you're buying low enough and selling high enough and you're good to go!
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:06:28
Hype drove it high in the first place, when there was little utility to back it.
Utility will come, and with it value will increase but it'll be slower and steadier now. Still, probably one of the best investments you can make. But it's not going bananas like it used to.
$15k, I think we'll see that by April, at least it'll be steadily $15k by that time, we might see it spike up there within the next few days, but I don't think it'll be steady at $15k for a few months.
I'm primarily basing that on the guess that hodlers are still excited about it and talking to friends and family, we're going to see people putting a little in to hodl, just in case, etc and hodlers will continue to accumulate. BTC will still be the primary trading currency on exchanges, and so on.
Adoption is going to come faster than people think. The cat's out of the bag and people know crypto has a major future. It's a matter of the hard work of the early adopters. As vendors really start signing on accepting currencies (real vendors) it's going to snowball pretty quickly. In a way it already has begun.
I do think BTC will largely act as a gold standard though. People will continue to HODL it because it keeps gaining value. There'll be other coins that are atomically swappable for BTC (and other cryptos altogether) which will be more frequently. BTC itself is going to be settlement layer, and reserved for big transactions.
So I think $20k isn't far off after that, maybe August. We may get as high as $40k, $50k by 2018.  I honestly would not be a bit surprised to see $100k. People might call me crazy and that's fine. I do think everyone selling off today and throughout 2018 is going to be kicking themselves 5 years from now.

Yes, it's necessary to open the channel before using it. Opening the channel requires there to be some funds committed to it. It's not a commitment that those funds will be spent, and it's not a "charge" in and of itself. Once the channel closes, assuming those funds were not spent, you get them back.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:25:37
This isn't all that unreasonable. Thanks for the addition.
However, I still think this is how the system ought to work. If they are genuinely able to handicap Bitcoin so much so with only 18% of hashing power, and this is really enough to push people to BCash, then maybe Bitcoin isn't robust enough.
Of course, I honestly don't think this is realistic. But for the sake of argument, and on principle, if they're able to break confidence / reduce usage of Bitcoin so easily, it probably isn't the trustless, permissionless, system we're looking for.
In reality though, I don't think this is AntPool's game plan, or I think they really would be doing empty blocks, and they'd probably be coercing / paying other miners / pools to do the same to really handicap Bitcoin to the point that no one can get a transaction through. I think it's less sinister, I think they are just trying to keep rates high, and I think it'll probably end up netting them less money in the long run, especially as LN goes mainnet on exchanges, that might be the nail in the coffin.

I think it's going to make sense for companies to use their own currencies. i.e. AppleSeeds, StarBucks, GoogleDimes, AmazonLeaves etc. Then they can give their own chains the characteristics they want you can maintain a balance with them, they can incentivize everything in their own bucks that nobody else has any say over. I'm surprised we haven't seen this already.
I think you'd be able to load it with other crypto or cash, similar to how airlines do miles. But if they do crypto with their own wallets and aspects, now they're in the crypto-space competing with other alts and gaining the benefits of being in that space on exchanges creating an asset from nothing that magically increases their company's value.

It's what the company makes of it. Yeah implemented completely in-house, closed source, accessible only by API etc, yes, this basically describes the reward point systems already in existence and there might be no point to branding it a "cryptocurrency".
However, it's what the company makes of it. It could still be "centralized", the source code is owned and licensed by the company, but it is shared with partners and exchanges, mining hardware could be sold and distributed (earning the buyer the coins, AND decentralizing the POW at least), smart contracts, etc, there could definitely be business-side benefits to it, and it's up to the company to figure out whether it's worth making it appealing to the customer or not.

Well, lots of US debt "create" money out of thin air. This increases supply of USD which lowers price. Since BTC isn't created out of thin air, one BTC can buy more USD than it used to because the USD price went down.
There's a million more factors, and it's not really this simple, but that's the main idea. Notice though that under these circumstances, "BTC value" didn't really change it was USD whose value changed.

Well, "having the right nonce" is the solution.


This suggests that there are "methods" and perhaps better and worse ways of "choosing" nonces. The fact is, every nonce has an equal chance of being the nonce which provides the solution so the "method" you use to choose the nonce is completely arbitrary.
There is no algorithm (that I know of) by which you increase your odds of choosing the correct nonce. It's possible I'm wrong and don't understand something.

This isn't necessarily true for everyone. Some people have things they need to purchase, or want to take profits on some gains. For those people, selling makes a lot of sense.


A lot of us are tired of this. Some folks bought into BTC to get rich. Most of them make posts about hodling because the BTC price hasn't risen enough from the price they bought at. These poor souls are usually FOMO victims. I know of some who spent their student loan money on BTC, and "investment" they didn't understand. It's a dangerous world when children are given government loans for nothing.


This is absolutely incorrect. If you have $100 worth of BTC and market forces drive BTC values down by 90% you have lost. Even if you didn't sell, your net worth in terms of bitcoin has decreased by 90%. That is a loss in anyone's book.


This is unequivocally false too. There is no such thing as a buyer without a seller, so the statement in and of itself is somewhat of a contradiction. If "people" just buy, and no one is selling, then there is no market. You can't buy what's not for sale. I hope that makes sense.
The Bitcoin ecosystem is finally large enough and accessible enough that it's robust at this point. Yes, big news and major movements of money in crypto are going to affect emotion and orders and price. But cryptocurrency and bitcoin in particular is a market that is at this point out of the hands of "hodlers" or any other coordinated entity. It's in the wild now and it's just a matter of seeing what happens.
There are reasons to think the price may increase, but it's entirely possible (not probable in my opinion) that speculation has propped the price higher than is justified. It is possible that BTC settles at $6k for a couple years (again, unlikely, but possible, no one knows).
Try not to treat bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme. It's not going to obey your whims, it's going to follow where the larger market directs it. A lot of us here think that's upward, but don't put in more than you can lose. Good luck out there.

No, this sucks. Theoretically, this could be tolerable when BTC price is both high and relatively stable. But **ONLY** because it's familiar based on USD and cents. Bitcoin is global, so this is a little silly to begin with.
There are other reasons this completely sucks. First, a Bitcoin is a fundamental unit, it's the whole unit and has existed from the beginning. Satoshi is the smallest divisible piece of a Bitcoin. These are fundamental.
Your whole argument is arbitrary. Hey, let's take BTC a fundamental unit, and divide it by a million! We can call that a "bit". Why divide by a million? Why not 10, why not 1,000 or 10,000?
Or starting from the Satoshi, another fundamental unit. Hey, let's take a satoshi and multiply it by 100, and call that a "bit". Ok, but the **only** benefit to doing this is because of the correlation between a "cent" and a "dollar". But this only makes sense to people who's everyday currencies are measured like this.
Further, what happens if BTC reaches very high valuations and we have to go to sub-Satoshi's for small payments. Now we have this arbitrary "cent" / "dollar" relationship at some goofy mid-point. When a Satoshi's value is somewhere in the range of $14, it's going to be pretty silly to be paying in "bits".
To throw in the term "bit" is asinine in and of itself. The term "bit" literally, logically, and historically means "binary digit". These aren't binary digits at all, why "bit"? Why not "nibble" or "word", the only reason someone came up with using "bit" is because it sounds computery and a somewhat common term but it really doesn't make sense.

\# of transactions is not at all an accurate measure of usage.

This obviously depends 100% on each individual miner's electricity cost.
I know people who mine where electricity cost is fixed per contract (so it's costing their landlord, but not them). These people can mine profitably indefinitely.
A significant portion of the world has very inexpensive electricity and it will be profitable for them to mine at very low prices.
I, for one, would continue to mine at a loss for quite some time. It may be stupid, but it's a calculated risk. I would mine, even at a loss, even if BTC hits $100, I'll mine until my reward goes below ~0.000004 BTC per kWh regardless of price. I base this on my estimated future BTC value and ROI requirements. My guess is a lot of miners have similar profitability calculations however it does depend on how big your operation is and how much out of pocket your electricity is costing you. It's definitely infeasible for big operations to mine at a loss for very long.

I'm pretty surprised to see so much agreement about statements like this in the crypto-community. Let me explain.
If Bitcoin truly is better currency than fiat, then it will take market dominance as a currency. This is simply the way things work. If Bitcoin has true advantages that are worth it to people over fiat, they will use it.
Suggesting that perpetuating views that Bitcoin is something other than a currency makes a difference is plain wrong. It doesn't matter how much anyone told you that Bitcoin was good as a table lamp. If it makes sense to use it as a table lamp, people will. If it doesn't, they won't. Plain and simple.
The same goes for Bitcoin as an investment. Right now, people have seen that there HAVE been Bitcoin millionaires, and general public does NOT see it being used as a currency. So to the general population, it does look like an investment. And for most regular joe's I know, that's exactly what it is. 
The whole HODL meme is explicitly based on [the idea of investment]( that it will appreciate:


Personally, I believe this is a short-term stepping stone, but it is the current mainstream application for Bitcoin until it is more stable AND usable as a currency. This isn't BCash shilling, btw, **NO** crypto is really even close approaching the usability of fiat yet.
Robinhood is a step in the right direction. No, it's not Bitcoin, no it's not an application of Bitcoin as currency, and no it's not where Bitcoin will be most valuable long-term. But, it is an acknowledgement that Bitcoin is here to stay.

I disagree. Blockchain isn't sentient and needs governance. Only when we have someone we can trust in charge of it will things really be made right.
We really need some forward thinking government to step up and put some enforcement on blockchain. A government that cares about the little guy. And no democracies either. We need a government run by smart people, that doesn't happen when you have idiots voting.

I see. I imagine you're not the only one. Too bad customer service in the crypto-world is so terrible. You could submit a support ticket but it might be 2020 before it's answered.

Right. It's all just dreaming until we can.
But, someday... Hodl.

We are going to see a new Bitcoin fork being pushed by *everyone*. 
Maybe we'll call it SegWit3x. It'll have LN support, it'll have faster blocks, it'll have x, y, z, and everything that a good fork should. Miners and Exchanges might support it, we'll have a futures market where 3X futures will start being traded.
Regular folks will signal No3X, etc etc (This'll be new for a lot of people). Roger and crew have meanwhile been buying up No3X futures pushing the price as high as possible. $5k? These same crooks divest all their BCash at T0, execute this attack in a major way, not one exchange targeted, but several, not $10M, but maybe $500M, they've been preparing this for some time, so they have a plan and have been running up BCash price and volume for a couple weeks also hounding BTC for its uselessness and flooding the network with spam tx to prop up the 3X futures.
Now, the attack BCash funds are sold and moved into alts, at the same time, all of the 3X futures are sold off and moved to alts. Then a mystery announcement gets sent out. "Hey everybody, actually, 3X doesn't have enough reception, so we're not going to go with it." BTC tanks as fork-anticipator funds move out and back into alts. Alts rise, Roger and friends prepare for a rinse and repeat in November.

Yeah, I thought about (1), and I agree that every node does not have the same view of the mempool, BUT, on average nodes would have a similar view of the mempool.
And I'm not suggesting looking at any individual transaction, more-so the number of transactions in the block in proportion to those my node knows of which are explicitly not in the block.
Theoretically my node MUST have some route to the mining node, so while our mem-pools are assuredly distinct, they ought not be off by so much that we'd disagree on this.
(2) almost makes sense and perhaps there could be a "lucky" allowance for this type of case. Like, if the block is within 30s of the prior block, suspend the transaction inclusion rule. But I still think adding the tx to the new block would be trivial.
Also, these types of rules would have to be in proportion to how full the mem-pool is.

Not sure, I wasn't there. In any case, not the best.

Can you point to a reference for what you're talking about? I know nothing, but it seems to me "choice" of nonce would be a non-issue / completely unimportant. What are you referring to?

I don't know of one, but I must believe Coinbase is going to be offering this in the near future as part of merchant services. Merchants are going to demand this, since a lot of businesses don't have the margins to offset the risk of crypto-volatility.

So much bad news... Bitcoin is dead. I guess you won't need to do your update next month. Let's go home everyone.

In short, no.
But it depends on what you're really asking. It's like saying, "Is there anything negative about driverless cars?" Well, sure, anyone who drives a car to earn a living is not going to be able to make a living that way anymore. But the efficiency gained is totally worth it.
Then there are other "negative characteristics", but they're a matter of perspective. You could say that 10min block times or 1mb blocks are "negative", just as you could say that the lack of protein in spinach is "negative". Well, the lack of protein in collard greens isn't really "negative", that's just not what they're for.
It is extremely important that people understand that YOU are in control of your money. That means when it gets stolen or when you get scammed, you don't have a CC company or bank to go bitch to. That's probably the biggest "risk".

This is probably right. Unfortunately.
I just feel like people have been speaking US Doomsday since Bush 2000. We were, and are, always on the brink of catastrophic failure. And while 2008 was bad, a lot of people got burned. Catastrophic it wasn't. We've band-aided it, pulled the wool over our eyes and are doubling down. What stops us from doing that next time?
I'm half convinced this is "new normal" and actually can go on forever.

You're confused about what the terms "worth" and "value" mean.
At their core, both are entirely subjective. So your statement:


Has no benefit, it's like saying, "By counting, you reach higher numbers". Yes, of course, because that's what counting is. If you weren't reaching higher numbers, rather catching fish you'd be fishing, not counting.
So to say that something's "worth" is "*what people believe it is worth*" is true by definition. The definition of worth is how much someone values it.
I'll try to make it more clear for you.
You can usually buy a jar of peanut butter for about $3 USD. That's its "price" not its "value". Someone who is allergic to peanuts will rarely find a jar of peanut butter *worth* $3 USD. However, where food is scarce and someone is NOT allergic to peanut butter, to that person the same jar of peanut butter is easily *worth* $3 USD.

You know how sometimes you're in the middle of a TV show, or a movie in a theater? You REALLY have to go to the bathroom but you are waiting to make sure you're not missing the most important parts? It's that.

I'm sure this has been discussed before and I'm guessing there's a good reason we don't, but can anyone point me to the source of discussion on why it's *undesirable* to enforce blocks include transactions.
I'm imagining in the consensus rules, if I'm a node, validating a block, if I see a block come through with 75% free space, and I can see that the mempool is full, reject the block. 
Why *not* do this?
It would at least discourage some malicious attackers from doing this, right?
