Well clearly we men of the Bitcoin board will have to band together and tell the CEO of Bitcoin that his reign of gender based discrimination is to be stopped immediately. I won’t stand for this. Until there are an equal amount of penises and vaginas involved in Bitcoin I won’t be silenced.

How much smaller is that? Like could a person carry that in their wallet or would you suggest a dedicated satchel for each portion of bitcoin? Would a whole bitcoin require something larger, like a backpack? ELI5 please

I have a feeling (I’m no expert) that if you split up the wealth of the world evenly among all the people, within 10 years it would look like this again, anyway. Some people are good with money, some people are bad with money. Some lucky, some unlucky. Some honest some dishonest. The medium of exchange won’t change that.

I have a new rule. Only talk about it if someone else brings it up. And even then, feel the room, and figure out who you’re dealing with first. Sometimes it’s best to just shut up, rather than have people listen to you, assume it’s a sure bet, and blame you when they don’t get rich a month later.

The thing about Bob, and I believe this is true of most Bobs,is he’s a thinker. Is Bob exciting? Not really. Is Bob the first one you’d call for a last minute Vegas trip? Not likely. But Bob, he knows what’s up. His head’s always on a swivel. When the government comes calling, Bob won’t be caught with his pants down. Bob was beating the system before the system knew he existed.

Then I think you’re already doing a good job. Keep in mind, and this is true with all sorts of topics, there are certain people who are just looking to get a rise out of you.

I’m fairly certain parallels to the wild west refer to the utter lack of protection offered by law, in the face of a brave new world. In other words, people are on their own, so they should keep their head on a swivel....it’s either that, or something to do with Will Smith riding around in a giant mechanical spider in the late 1800s American South...Never mind, that’s the Wild WILD West. Horrible Rotten Tomatoes score I see.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:36:58
I have to say I’m a little disappointed that in 3017, widespread bitcoin usage appears to be the only thing that’s different, but maybe I’ve seen too many sci-fi movies. I just want my own jet pack, is that too much too ask?

If you keep anything on your phone, you could also just delete the app before travelling and recover with the seed, after, right? Assuming you don’t plan on using it while on the trip, anyways. That’s probably what I’d do, until I had a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:20:04
Yeah definitely. This is just more of a worst case scenario idea. They can’t take anything from your phone if they don’t know you have it in the first place.

Nope I mean Wild Wild West. It shows 17% Rotten Tomatoes. Clearly they didn’t buy into the steampunk western theme.

I can understand why you’re pissed off, but I didn’t charge you those fees. And I wasn’t belittling you. I offered advice that, as it turned out, wasn’t applicable to your situation. I don’t use Coinbase for transactions, so I don’t know. I’m sure somebody else here does. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:08:45
Agreed. My only request, generally speaking, is that, if you’re going to address me with a derogatory term, make sure you’re consistently using the same one, so I know when you’re referring to me in a setting with others present. Just a preference of mine.

I may have to check that out yet. Honestly, I have no idea why that movie came to mind. I guess “wild west” just rang a bell in my head. Salma Hayek in her prime + teenage boy at the height of puberty, might have had something to do with it.

Wouldn’t you be able to sort of “clean” your bitcoin by swapping it to a privacy coin and then swapping it back to bitcoin again after? Sort of like laundering it I guess without the criminal aspect. The trail should be dead once it’s swapped into a true privacy coin right? I guess your IP address could still come into play, I’ll actually just shut up, because really I have no idea.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:21:02
I don’t know exactly what your situation is, but I don’t move my bitcoin off of coinbase until I’ve accumulated enough for the $20 to be fairly insignificant, relatively speaking. It’s still to high, but in Canada my options are pretty limited.

I get what you’re saying, but it’s worth pointing out that a lot of money gets printed to replace money taken out of circulation or money that is otherwise destroyed. The number I found was 90% bill replacement. I don’t know how accurate that is, and it didn’t mention denomination, but it’s just something to keep in mind. Also that was for America, I don’t know about other countries.
@_date: 2018-06-30 02:16:02
No, because 90% of any given thing is, by definition, not 100% of that thing. And that’s enough reddit for today. Good night, and don’t forget to take your pills before your mom tucks you in tonight.
@_date: 2018-06-30 01:33:28
Well aren’t you a treat. Yeah it’s 1000 billions. I’ll repeat myself, the numbers I found were around 90% replacement, but i don’t know the denominations. Why don’t you “do the math” you twat. I wasn’t being confrontational, just putting some food for thought out there, I didn’t realize your fuse would disappear quicker than a line of coke in front of John Mcfee’s nose.

Make sure You keep all the pure, best quality bitcoins for yourself. I only sell low quality bitcoins to people of colour. Now I have to figure out a way to deal with the Asians...they’re not white...but they kind of are. Plus they’re crucial to the industry. It’s a dilemma, I’m not sure how to deal with it.

Yeah I’m a way, we know that it works. There are still a lot of people that have nothing to do with it though. I guess what I meant was we’ll find out if the lightning network will get put into wide spread use and so on. 1 BTC will be very valuable in that case. I hope it does. I don’t want to ever sell my BTC, I want to use it, for whatever I want to. That will be success, IMO.

@_date: 2018-02-18 20:57:17
Good point. I just wonder more if people will, due to lack of knowledge, simply look at other coins and think that because they’re cheaper, that’s where they will invest/store money.
I personally think that a very important factor will be ease of use. If BTC and LN can lock that down, I think it’s game over for pretty much every alt coin, but I could be wrong.
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:37:13
I think in 5 yrs we will probably know if this whole thing is a success or not. So it’ll either be worth nothing, because it’s dead, or a lot because mass adoption has begun. Gonna be interesting to watch it all unfold.

@_date: 2018-02-18 20:35:56
I’ve wondered that too. Do you think atomic swaps will dilute value at all? Part of me thinks that the ability to quickly swap from LTC, VTC, and maybe others, to BTC, will make owning BTC less important. But I don’t know enough about the tech or the economics to come up with a solid answer.
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:58:42
Haha, that was what makes Reddit worth it.
@_date: 2018-04-18 18:33:08
Most wealthy people keep their wealth in assets, not actual money. I highly doubt Bill Gates has a warehouse full of dollar bills. I’ve actually heard from a couple of rich (not extreme wealth, just well off) people that they actually have very little spending money, and that most of it is tied up in investments or assets. Obviously, that is anecdotal, but it’s definitely something I’m going to keep in mind as I get older.
@_date: 2018-04-06 04:37:04
Oh, that looks familiar.
@_date: 2018-04-18 19:23:37
That could very well be, but it’s also not the banks job to play mommy and daddy for everyone. Most people have debt because of decisions they’ve made. That doesn’t mean some people haven’t been screwed over by the system, but most people get into trouble because they don’t plan properly or live beyond their means. In the past those were both problems I had, and it was no ones fault but mine. No one forced me to take out loans.
@_date: 2018-04-28 19:17:00
It’s been close to 50/50 for a while now. A little more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:38:39
DYOR, but to me, it’s classic indicator of the price increasing rapidly. You can tell because the line is green, singular, and heading in an upward direction. This typically means that the price of the asset is now higher than it was previously. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 18:20:51
Keep in mind though, that on a personal level, as long as people are taking out loans for things they can’t afford, debt will remain an issue, regardless of currency. I know people who put couches and TVs on payments because they insist on having the best. That is a problem no coin will fix.
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:16:51
The banks can only do so much. They have rules for loans as well. Monthly income, debt percentage, credit, etc. The borrower makes the decision to ask for a loan in the first place. Most people know full well when they should an shouldn’t be taking loans. I know of a man who was willing to pay any price any term for a vehicle he liked as long as he could make the monthly payments. It’s not the banks job to play daddy and tell him what to do. He’s foolish and there are many like him.

That’s true, and it’s definitely become a problem in areas. But people have been aware of this for a while now and continue to make many of the same choices. You’re not required to go to college, and if you decide to go, maybe work a bit first to save up some money. Pick a field of study that’s in high demand. As for a house, it might be a better option to rent for a while. Again, I’m not denying that these are real problems for people, life can unfortunately be a tough ride, I just hate it when people claim it’s all the system out to get us. We all feed the system, so when we make smart financial decisions, that system has a lot less power over each of us.

I should clarify that I’m not saying the banking system is innocent, just that if people, as individuals, made better financial decisions, the banking system wouldn’t be nearly as relevant. I agree that there have been and currently are, issues. I don’t feel that we are all cute little puppies being beat to death by the evil man with a claw hammer. It often feels like that’s the attitude of many people.
