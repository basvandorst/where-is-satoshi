Some more stumbling blocks:
* you generate and address that you plan on giving to to everyone as your "pay-to" address without realizing everyone you've given it to can see exactly how much money you're being given by everyone else.
* you ask to borrow a bit of money from a friend, he agrees and you see in your wallet that a certain transaction (let's call it TX0) funds the address you gave your friend. A few days later you want to give some money back, (plus a little extra as a thank you) to the friend, so you send it back to the address that was used as TX0's input. Oops! Your friend may never get the money because he sent you TX0 from &amp;amp;amp;lt;insert custodial Bitcoin service here&gt;. Better hope they have good customer support!

Why would your parents be ok with this? There's a real risk their bank could close their account. You should not be involved in this. Tell this "someone" to wire the money to an exchange like kraken or bitfinex or bitstamp, and buy it himself. It will be cheaper than the 4% fee you're asking, and you won't have to worry if he is using your parents to launder money and flagging their account for suspicious activity. If he *can't* do that, because it's cash or he doesn't want to use his own bank account, maybe you should think about if you really want his money tumbling through your parent's account.
All that aside, 4% is way too low. Most in-person trades using mycelium or localbitcoins take 10%.

* The simple way addresses can be hidden behind contacts
* The 'apps' make it extensible.
* Unit/precision stuff is great
* There is no "up" button in the action bar in the 'apps' list or in an 'app', making the android back button the only navigation available
* I couldn't figure out how to edit/remove a contact.
* I couldn't figure out how to remove an 'app'
* When you long-press an icon in the action bar, a toast is shown with the action name. But you have a grid of icons in the main view with no text and no long-press toast. I guess it's fun to encourage first-time users to click on everything to see what happens, but noobs don't want to be afraid or hesitant when it comes to money.
* Of the four icons in the main view, the camera icon sticks out. It's the only one with a gradient, and it is not as sharp as the others, probably because it is missing an xxhdpi asset.
* Consider making the currency list searchable by its rows' human-readable name. "Gold" should find XAU, "Switzerland" should find CHF

Talk is cheap. Saying "it does work" and linking to a half-year-old thread (in which there is also no proof) is not helpful. Instead, link to proof that ANYONE has had success using it to essentially get 90% a merchant's product. If this service has been up for that long, there has to be at least one "success" story, if only to gloat. The idea just seems sketchy as fuck, and the FAQ has some ridiculous shit saying somehow miners in a pool can make a profit outside of pool earnings, and that private keys should be sent over the network, so excuse me for being skeptical.

You're right, in that the cost of mining a coin is about the same as the cost of buying a coin. Fewer and fewer coins are going to be mined as halvings occur. We're already at 13m/21m, and we have a ways to go before fees are anywhere near the value of coinbase transactions.

So much poorly understood and under-researched statements that are just wrong in that post. Between his dismissal of possible ECDSA vulnerabilities being more likely once a private key has been used to sign a tx, spouting nonsense concerning bad RNGs being better with 1 address than with many addresses (hint, he's wrong because bad RNGs should be used for 0 addresses, and any positive number is equally bad as any other positive number), to saying backups need to be made for every newly generated key (as if that wasn't solved ages ago with key pools), I can't take anything this guy says seriously.

So where you live, let's say you have an account with about sixty thousand US dollars (or Canadian, or Australian, or pounds, or euros, or francs, doesn't matter) and you want it as cash. No ATM is going to let you withdraw that, I don't care what you say your fees are for. And going through a human teller at your bank will take hours (or days) of interviews and forms, and the bank will likely have to file a Suspicious Activity Report without telling you.

For $500, I'd say whatever, do it. But 11k is like 5x the "suspicious activity" amount defined by FinCEN, at least for MSB's, and over 10k is even more suspicious if the money isn't already in dollars. Do your own research and don't rely on random redditors.

Each address you create should be used for one spend transaction **only**. If you are sending change to a spending address, that is address re-use. If you are giving the same address to multiple people so they can pay you, that is address re-use. If you use a paper wallet more than once, that is address re-use.
Edit: sending coins to the same cold-storage wallet is not ideal, but as long as you haven't spent from it, it's not the end of the world. Consider making multiple cold-storage wallets. If there are too many, consolidate them every once in a while to a fresh address.

the real question is: why can't you pay for your flights with bitcoin and then buy back the bitcoin immediately with fiat?

If the answer is that you have such a small financial cushion that flight payments need to be delayed or put on credit, then you probably shouldn't be speculating with so much of your money.

@_date: 2015-05-25 11:28:07
The bitcoin protocol can change the difficulty based on the hash rate of x previous blocks to target y bocks/hour. x and y are hardcoded, but the system is sustainable. Satoshi picked x=2016 and y=6. Eventually fees will float too, since a hardcoded minimum fee with no regard for bitcoin value / purchasing power is not sustainable.
Why not make the block size limit sustainable? Every *X* blocks, get the median block size *S* of those *X* blocks, and make the maximum block size for the next *X* blocks = *S* \* *Y*, where *Y* is a hardcoded multiplier. How about *X*=2016 and *Y*=6, same as difficulty. It could even have the same limits that difficulty has (like not being able to adjust by more than 4x or less than 0.25x at a time)
Maybe *Y* should be lower, like 3. Maybe *X* should be higher, like 8064. But either way, this would be sustainable. Tx/second can grow organically, a malicious miner can't bloat by too much, there's a bit of room for peaks like big holidays while providing a bit of scarcity (read: higher fees) during those peaks. Is there something undesirable about this idea that no core dev has suggested anything other than a fixed number (read: kicking the can down the road) for max block size?

Sorry, but none of this makes any sense. You mention "last digit of the block" not being known and using that to change fees into outputs back to sender.
Let's first address these digits. If you mean the block's height, it is known before the block is mined. If you mean block's hash, then it is dependent on the transaction, so changing the transactions would make the hash invalid. Unless the refund is in another block, which wouldn't make any sense either.
Then there's the idea of a refund. Who gets it? Is it split between all the tx inputs as evenly as possible? The miners would have no idea which change address to use; that's for sure. Plus the headache for accounting, especially for systems that allow off-chain transactions which usually decouple tx inputs from users (all exchanges, payment processors, tip bots, etc).

1) you can have websites and programs respond to the Bitcoin protocol so that you can just click on a QR code and it takes you to whatever wallet you want (coinbase, circle, Bitcoin core, electrum, multibit, etc) on the spend page with address and amount filled out. Super easy. On PC this works with websites and apps; on android this works with any app you have installed; on iOS it works with the last wallet app you installed (apple designed that aspect poorly, it's not the app devs' faults).
2) Why would one be called "Bitcoin" and the other be called "Coinbase" even though Coinbase lets you pay from any wallet (using the protocol stuff I mentioned above)? Twitch (the game streaming website) has the same kind of choice: If you use "Bitcoin" Xsolla waits for one confirmation, if you use "Coinbase" the 0conf transaction is accepted.

In Switzerland, you can take advantage of the fact that chain restaurants and supermarkets all still have the 1.20 peg until corporate HQ says otherwise. Just go to any corner store exchange (they're everywhere), change a bit more than 200CHF for a 200€ note, then spend it in those places. They give change in Swiss francs and you can end up with more money than you had in the morning.

1) Many times, using the fast app switcher to open it leaves it on a blurry screen where I'm assuming a bug broke the Touch ID prompt.
2) No way to tag received fund origin. Just "external account".
3) Nowhere does it display the current price of a Bitcoin.
4) Before confirming a purchase/withdrawal in dollar amounts, it displays neither the rate that will be applied nor the final amount in bitcoins. You can't even see how many bitcoins were added in the details screen of a purchase/withdrawal.
5) No landscape orientation or native iPad support.
Apart from all that, it does work, it's not ugly, the rate is generally the best you can get (short of using a market order on an exchange), and they recently fixed a whole bunch of problems (the worst of which was you were unable to transfer Bitcoin amounts below 1).

I thought we were talking about money being safe from the bank's problems. You're talking about money being safe from your problems. If garnishments and creditors are a problem, get out of debt. If unauthorized card transactions are a problem, have an account at a different bank than the one you have a card at and pay attention to your card statements (and don't use your card on unsecured connections or on shady websites, and get a card with better fraud policies).

Not to mention that not only does he have to try to move it immediately, he has to check that it has a balance worth more than the goods you're buying, and that there isn't another transaction using the same inputs that will make his transaction look like a double spend. The double-spend check should extend to a few seconds after he moves the money too. And then he also needs to know where to send the change. All around, this is a terrible idea.

Pools that need to make lots of payouts do so over multiple transactions. Transaction 1 has tons of tiny outputs plus a big amount to a change address, and the another transaction with a bunch of outputs and another change address, etc. mostly to keep the individual transaction sizes reasonable.

* odd grammar, missing words
* odd capitalization ("New Version" in last sentence)
* really lazy formatting, and oddities in the changelog (repeated numbers, 
* domain problems. **mull**tibit.com (even if you forgot that it's supposed to be multibit.org, the misspelling is a red flag), and "multi**bitt**
* direct link to an exe file (why would the devs presume to know the receiver is on Windows?)
* the person receiving this never gave the multibit devs his email address, so how is he being contacted? Even if the person doesn't realize this, there is no apology for the inconvenience, or a link to unsubscribe.
Basically, if an unsolicited mail is asking action of you, always triple-check that website names have no misspellings. Even if they don't seem misspelled, google the company name and make sure the TLD (.org, .net, .com, etc) matches. A direct link to an executable (.exe, .vbs) or an attachment to one will NEVER be present in any company's email.

And then since I said "so many" instead of "some" or "a few", the rest of it isn't worth pondering?
So now what's the next step in this little dance? I reword? I contend by saying we're also equating a handful of core devs who won't work on 2X as "many"? I attack the character of the core devs? I defend the characters of the devs I named?

I assumed when OP said "exchange rate charges" he meant fixed fees for foreign currency transactions (like $20 or whatever per tx), and I suggested that with the proper planning, that is a non-issue. I don't think any decent card actually fucks you over with the exchange *rate* more than a percent or two. And since credit cards usually give you 1-3% rewards, the exchange rate is never the problem; it's the fees.

When visiting another country, plan ahead. I have a credit card that has zero-fee foreign transactions (I use it often and sometimes the exchange rate seems off, but never by more than 0.5%, which is made up for with ~2 reward points per dollar spent) and I'm sure your bank has something similar.

I gave a paper wallet to a friend's son nearly a year ago. I said he should spend it quickly or risk it devaluing. I explained that the easiest way to spend at the food place that accepts Bitcoin near here involved sweeping the balance to a phone app so he could scan their QR code.

Do you realize what that mistake really means, though? It could mean they had no staging area or unit tests, or they decided not to use them.

As a programmer, you should know what a stack (the data structure) is. To break down the example: 01 means "push 01 on the stack", 02 means "push 02 on the stack" and op\_add means "execute the ADD OPeration", which will pop the last two stack frames and push the result (3). There are a bunch of operations you can try; look at autocomplete when you type "op_"
Another example to try: "5 4 3 op_add op_mul" = 5*(4+3) = 35
It's kinda like RPN.

Xapo email = 10000 satoshi / tip
Wallet address = 1000 satoshi / tip
Basically, you choose between your tips being 10 times smaller, or having to give Xapo your phone number.
EDIT: I got the numbers above by testing both tip types, but tip amounts are random. The app does warn that address tips will be smaller than Xapo tips, though.

"Many" is a weasel word, and Apple *for a time* did not allow Bitcoin apps in their walled-garden store, but that hasn't been that case for months (see: Circle app, Coinbase app, breadwallet, Sarutobi, etc).

How does that work with all-or-nothing? Then it's all-or-half or nothing. Or-all-or-two-thirds-or-one-third-or-nothing. If a good idea on Lighthouse gets good exposure, reach their goal, but no one else can donate, should the creators make a "continued" one (making sure the end time matches that of the first, and editing the first one's description to mention the new one so people don't just think donations are closed), or risk leaving money on the table? When Lighthouse project "Good Idea (continued) part 78" reaches its limit, part 79 should be made? Popular Kickstarter campaigns have hundreds of thousands of backers, so that is thousands of "continued" projects, and a nightmare of usability and discoverability.

Transactions can depend on one another.

Until projects can have ambitious all-or-nothing funding goals with with low minimum donation amounts, Lighthouse can never be mainstream.
