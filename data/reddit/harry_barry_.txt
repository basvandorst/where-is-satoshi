Remind me in a few hours when it's going up again

"healthy correction" I don't know, but is a 50% "correction" healthy? Don't get me wrong, I'm not panic selling, but how is a drop of this size a correction
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:52:11
C'mon, it's been above €10.000 for a day, aaaand it dropped again
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:19:38
So you're saying that a dump of &gt;50% isn't one of the largest dump since anyone really cared?
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:20:13
How long will it go up for? I'm kinda sketchy buying right now seeing the graph of the last few days
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:15:13
Will it drop in the next 5 hours? What do you think
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:33:29
Let's hope so, I still need to make my 1100 back from my investment
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:30:43
Haha *cries in corner*

Coinbase: "We anticipate buying of BCH", yeah, if you could just enable my buying of anything at all, also enable my GDAX account because I have verified myself in 2 different ways, also verified 2 of my banks (each independently and together), that'd be great

Why is it suddenly dropping so hard?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:40:32
It's been a correction for the entire month, I don't think this is really healthy
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:41:18
Woah, calm down a bit there 
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:35:04
How exactly?
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:06:09
Just hodl the drop away
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:53:20
Wait, even if it's €200, people will say "but it has gone up though from 2013
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:52:30
Worst decision of my life, investing again...... I just got over the fact that I can't fix this except just work my ass off after half a week of feeling horrible. Someone I know laughs at the dip and waits it away... HOW CAN I GET THIS MENTALITY?
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:49:22
I invested and got like $2000 out of it, bought shit and invested again, losing $2000, so now Im 1300 in debt at myself...
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:17:47
You mean it's going to hit 8k soon?
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:38:14
Yeah, too bad GDAX and coinbase fucked me over because my GDAX account is suspended for some reason, I contacted them multiple times and no reaction
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:30:19
I don't think it will reach 19300 anytime soon, I hope you didn't buy more than .2 or so, because it might take at least a month or likely more.

Enjoy the sudden price increase everyone because I just sold
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:13:58
Just let me vent here for a little bit okay:
The last 2 weeks I felt horrible (especially last week) and I panic sold a little bit, maximizing my losses in the process. In the end I calculated that I lost around $40 in total, which isn't that big, but because I have been fucking retarded (and greedy as fuck) I invested again while already having bought 1040 worth of PC parts from my lottery money as I call it and thus being in debt at myself, which I can fix just by working...
Lesson here: DON'T be greedy, if you have gotten even $100 out of bitcoin, fuck it, be happy, live life a little better.

A wallet is only to hold a currency, at trade markets like GDAX (if they don't fuck you over like me) you can trade BTC/ETH/BCH/LTC for money, then transfer that money to your own bank account
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:40:27
Wait what? It's €9899 right now, ofcourse the dip isn't over yet
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:35:13
Personally I think these are becoming excuses, first the WSJ-bonusses were supposed to increase the price, which it didn't, now this new year thing? I'm not saying this is impossible, but just that these sound like excuses to hodl (believe me, I want the price to go up too)
