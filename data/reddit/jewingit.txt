Bought my first bit of coin today. It feels good. Hasn't changed too much so far.

I was the same way and said fuck it and bought a little bit today. Nothing that's gonna put me out if it dips or the bubble bursts, but enough that I will be doing a lot more research on this cryptocurrency and hope to learn a lot from it.

So my father just gave me $1,000 to invest into bitcoin today and I bought in at about 17k. This is on top of other investments I have made with my own money. I've been talking this up to him for the past couple of months and he finally bit. He gave me the money because I know about it more than he does, but I still don't know a lot. Is it now time to get a personal wallet?

I don't think it was homophobic, they weren't in fear of gays, rappers and artists just didn't care for it. Also, whole yes I can choose what to quote, this is the line that would make the most sense in relation to this thread.

Ha I bought a little higher than that, but we'll see!

Ah yes, the classic quoting lyrics.

Happy I was able to pick some more up at mid 13's

You know, watching the price I thought about that after buying. I was happy that my father finally has some faith in this though, so I bought. Luckily, he's not in a position where he needs an immediate turn around and it's something that we can do and talk about with each other, so that's great!

I've seen that the floor is high, but the ceiling seems to be even higher.

Okay cool. Yeah was about to verify my identity, but figured I'd ask her first. Thanks all!
