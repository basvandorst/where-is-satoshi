bubble, bubble, bubble, everyone shouts bubble lately, the thing is bubble is going to be when no one expects it not now, and not for just a 200B market, it needs to reach at least a few trilions, only my opinion at least, I do not recomend to ride the wave or get out of it

Sure, it's like pregnancy, if you're pregnant with twins it will take you 18 months till you give birth

the gods will be happy with your offering

If you can't even be bothered to look it up on google before posting I would say it's probably better this way

I feel really bad for you but blaming Kraken instead of blaming yourself for the stress you had in your life is wrong, this is crypto world, nothing is guaranteed and people that see this as a fast way of making money usually end up under the bridge
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:07:00
there is nothing rational but the crypto market is not mature yet, we are just getting in waves of newbies that just wanna get rich quick (dot com bubble rings a bell), I know it's crazy but hopefully we still have 1-2 years to get the best out of it, the returns in percentage I made this year (and probably it was more luck than knowledge) makes me believe I'm actually good at it lol

 I believe it is 0.0005 BTC or something like that, my coins have been stored on hardwallets  for more than a year or so,I'm  only moving them into Trex or Binance when I wanna dip into alts and then they go back to hardwallet so can't really say for sure.

you didn't fucked up, you bought Bitcoin Cash for  BTC is  Different coin that's all, you can swap BCash for BTC or you can stick with BCash, your call

I went all in with my life savings and I might as well go broke but I will not dump lol

That's when I will think if I keep on buying..for me those money are gone already  and I can honestly tell you there is no  better feeling in the world than knowing you are investing and fighting for something that actually makes sense in this crazy world
@_date: 2017-01-05 09:58:01
oh no!!!! I'm losing my life savings!!!
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:52:05
Thanks. I'm in for the long run anyway, end of year is when I'm drawing the line and considering my options
@_date: 2017-01-03 11:17:40
f'em all bro. Since I've got involved into BTC i'm feeling like i'm finally doing something that goes on the same path with my beliefs. It's not even about money and winning anymore, if it drops it drops but i will never give up on digital currency unless all the believers are declaring it dead.
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:23:08
good pus
@_date: 2017-01-03 10:55:56
yes and no. every single day passing BTC gains more stabilty , if it drops it will be just a small drop and for  the next few weeks trend "should" be bullish. Unless something big happens like banks starting a media war against BTC (which can go both ways for BTC holders) or another huge scandal or hack (less possible now that buyers have so many options) BTC should never go back to under 500-700
@_date: 2017-01-17 23:13:26
I love how you love the currency and  how you love the idea behind it. Now will you please send me bitcoins?

Strong hodl by the end of January!

At least now I have a valid reason to live until '27
@_date: 2017-01-08 21:23:30
I'm in the same spot as you. Give it 5 working days since you made the deposit then open a new ticket. It seems that we have to wait 5 days until our deposit is processed.
@_date: 2016-12-26 03:13:13
I'm using the wallet from Exodus...very simple to use...but if you're in for the long run i would go with a hard wallet like trezor, keepkey or nano ledger 
@_date: 2016-12-28 01:22:24
that's weird...i can see it as 939 highest point on worldcoinindex. Which one is more accurate?
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:53:37
upvote for your arrogance
@_date: 2016-12-31 19:51:22
whoa...heading to 2017, asking about a currency that will rule in a few years but you're still living in the 15th century?
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:36:25
@_date: 2016-12-24 02:03:55
Let it stagger...that's a good sign!
@_date: 2016-12-24 16:03:36
This! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:23:15
sold everything...will buy on a later date
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:30:12
I was more concerned if it would have stayed at +12% for the day, we need a nice and stable grow, a correction from time to time to put a red candle on the chart is more than welcomed
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:07
I'm only in for the adrenaline rush, the fittest survives
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:13:59
yes, BTC keeps on crashing for one year already, I just wonder how I bought mine at 700
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:45:29
they are still laughing now even though I'm 10x in this bitch
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:56:26
The majority of them lost more than 50% of their value, only the top 2 went up. I believe that's the reality that most refuse to see.
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:01:30
Yea few projects working on that but I believe Komodo already did it 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:40:57
why would you get into margin trading into a volatile market? then the only liquidity on Kraken is vs EURO, if you really wanna go for it but right now I would only do scalping and learn TA and margin trading meanwhile, once you start seeing signs of bull or bear market you start margin trading.
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:17:35
what about atomic swaps?
