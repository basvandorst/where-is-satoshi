Wow, the 10k support has been aggressively tested since yesterday. But the graph gets beaten back just as aggressively. If it stays that way bitcoin is stronger than we all thought and we have an incredible year ahead of us!

The dream is not over. But the bear market will go on for a while. Maybe 6 months, maybe 1 year. But we will recover.

Kraken ist very laggy atm, you just have to try again and again, but reload the trading-Interface after every try because sometimes the order is placed but you cant see it. Kraken is legit, just stay there, they will improve the situation soon

So the tethers card house finally collapses. This is a good thing longterm and a good oppurtinity to buy cheap coins shortterm.

Quiet heavy drop incoming, look at the volume.

Its over, its fucking over. Sold at 10k, 8k and now the rest of coins i still had, luckly 5-6x profit. Will buy back in when btc is below 2k and forget about it for 2-3 years.

8/7.8k Support is getting weaker and weaker, stay strong guys!

Despite all eventually buy walls I'm quiet sure that 5k is the next stop if we break 7.5
