Yup, sorry if it's a dumb question. I'm just scared about all the "bubble" stuff I've heard  
@_date: 2017-01-04 07:04:58
I'm good thanks, I'm willing to lose the investment 
Are you just trying to be condescending?
@_date: 2017-01-04 09:52:13
Humanity in a nutshell 
@_date: 2017-01-05 02:46:49
That analogy probably works on 95%+ percent of people lol.
But I actually am gay, and I do own some BTC  
I wish I could buy more but I can't afford it right now, I want to go to the moon too haha!!
@_date: 2017-01-04 03:50:02
And an asteroid denier apparently 
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:40:24
A good investor wouldn't pull it all out at this price, just enough to make a good profit. 
Then when the bubble starts to pop they could sell the rest and still make a profit.
*I think, I'm no investor, just a random new guy*
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:52:32
I keep seeing in this sub how slow and steady it is 
@_date: 2017-01-04 08:10:25
I'm not scared of losing my money lol
@_date: 2017-01-04 07:05:39
It's not about the money, I don't have much in there. Definitely willing to lose it 
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:10:39
I wouldn't say it's steady 
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:56:39
I don't think much changed
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:28:01
@_date: 2017-01-04 07:01:47
Keyword is risk, I hope it was a responsible risk and that you liquidate at the right time 
@_date: 2017-01-05 00:35:53
It went up over 100 in one day... that's not slow imo
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:38:17
What's Satoshi I'm a super noob I guess
I currently have .02 BTC basically I have a total of $20 but it's increased in the last week or two  
(I'm really new so I'm not yet comfortable putting my life savings into it)
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:23:34
This sub ~~can be~~ is very condescending to newcomers 
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:01:52
I think 1 bitcoin will have to cost 1 billion dollas for my $20 to become 20million
I'm new lol
did really lazy math so I might be wrong idk   
@_date: 2017-01-04 07:00:48
@_date: 2016-12-28 21:22:08
I'm new what's huobi?
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:13:18
I have coin base, but what does 5 bucks worth do for me? I figured I'd need atleast $100 
Then again, I don't know how it works 
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:30:04
I'm learning 
That's why I only have a few bucks in there right now 
@_date: 2016-12-25 19:29:10
I'd get some bits but I'm clueless about what it is and how it works...
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:20:34
I bought bitcoins from coinbase by simply putting in my card # and buying them
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:38:39
I've done this, I'll probably also work on memorizing the code as well
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:36:25
Still in college :)
And yes I can do basic math, but I'd rather someone else do it.
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:10:12
Thanks, I couldn't find that option but I finally did.
But yeah, I have a 12 word seed 
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:15:01
Gee, thanks a bunch. I'll do it right now and send you the receiving address 
@_date: 2017-01-04 07:40:56
At this rate it will 
Edit: yup...
@_date: 2016-12-26 05:29:49
It's fine, the other users explained it all to me. No need to be rude 
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:40:06
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:41:13
Sure is 
I think I'll go to a different bitcoin forum with friendly users tho
@_date: 2016-12-26 01:37:06
True, my $.89 just became $.90 
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:14:12
Oh, ok thank you! I'll probably use mycelium instead
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:56:03
Probably smart, I feel like the only cynical one sometimes.
There's still a possibility that it drops again 
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:29:07
That clears it all up for me. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:14:47
I have coinbase wallet, is that good?
However, what is a private key?
Thank you for the info 
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:35:50
I didn't think he was talking about the math part.
I've passed Calculus in college, it was mostly about the other broke bitcoin users 
@_date: 2016-12-28 21:27:05
Hard because you have to physically be in China?
@_date: 2016-12-29 04:29:55
Coinbase isn't a wallet. I think it's just an exchange or something 
I use mycelium. Backed up with a 12 word seed. 
Bought from coinbase and sent the coins to my secure wallet on the mycelium app. Very easy to do with that app  
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:56:50
What's your net worth?
@_date: 2016-12-29 04:16:32
Seems like a whole Lotta guessing 
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:39:44
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:28:00
So this is my address
14tRyrN1hc9iNYBZYpzrvYv3EFPPaRmARB 
Edit: backed up the account I have with mycelium. But there no login or password? Is the wallet only on this device? 
Edit2: ohh, the special words are the key to the account oh ok. Right. I get it now  
@_date: 2016-12-28 22:03:19
Also the day when Underworld: Blood Wars comes out. The 5th underworld movie...
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:15:04
I don't know if keeping all your savings on bitcoin is a good idea 
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:36:41
Lol, you guys sure aren't friendly 
@_date: 2016-12-28 21:00:40
Yeah can't have newcomers here trying to become part of the community unless they come here with news sources 
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:59:59
Oh yeah, I wish I could buy a few whole bitcoins
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:46:53
Thank you! So I just watch it grow now? I'm excited 
I'll be adding more for sure
