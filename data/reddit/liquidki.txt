That's a good point. It will be a matter of record to show what ratings they gave and when, and how well their ratings held up to reality.

I just turned 40 and when I was in my 20s this is exactly what all my friends and I did. We went out all the time, eating and drinking most of our money away on things we could make at home for a fraction of the cost.
And guess what? It's exactly what my parents say they did in their late teens and early 20s. Ever hear of the 60s?
At some point we either decide what we're doing isn't helping us and we shift from spending to saving, or we don't.

Thanks for the link. A good read, and very nice to step back a bit and look at these cycles.
If this guy's predictions are correct we are close to the end of this cycle. Though by his own admission in the conclusion he notes that he had forecasted the Nov 2013 bubble to peak around 2500 but it only made it to around 1200. Still a great read and reinforces what we already know about the possibility of predicting the top or bottom of any given cycle.

I feel you, man. The speed of the internet certainly works against our self control. Not only that but advertisers are deeper in our heads than ever before, and ready to target their ads when we're most willing/vulnerable to make a purchase.
Human adaptation still exists though, and we have the chance to escape these cycles of consumerism. Unfortunately that means giving up things, it might be giving up popularity, it may mean having to find a new group of friends, or to cease being as cool in the eyes of your contemporaries. To live is to struggle, yet hopefully we can find some joy in that. All the best to you.

There are hundreds of currencies in the world because there are hundreds of geographic areas in the world where each of these is issued and accepted, and that's how it's been for a very long time. 
Bitcoin and other cryptos aren't limited by geography in the same way as these currencies, so it seems logical that parent has a point worthy of discussion. If BTC can get and keep fees low and transactions fast, I don't really see why we'd need something like LTC, since those are the only things LTC claims to do that BTC doesn't.

I wish I knew how much of a gamble it is, but that's the point, no one knows.

Thanks for the good points.
The only problem I see with looking at BTC's ups and downs on charts 2+ years--or TBH anything older than 6 months--ago is that the number of people in the market now, the number of hedge funds, the overall participation and trust in the fundamental tech seems much higher now.
I feel like it stands to reason that we might not see another dip/crash of the kind we saw before where we lose 50%+.
What do you think?

So nobody can predict the future, except you?
We could dig up any number of charts showing an asset that gained value with corrections on the way up, then at some point stopped following that pattern and went down and down and down.
Stick to "no one can predict the future" and treat investing in an unprecedented asset as what it is: a gamble.

Because it makes something sound more important than it is. We redditors know all about that xD. (edit: misspelling)
