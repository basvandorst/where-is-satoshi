A double life sentence for Ross (34) ends up being much more severe than a similar punishment for El Chapo (61) who will most likely die within 20 years. Also as someone who believes that all drugs should be legalized, signing this petition is a way for us to show that the government should not be able to interfere with people's personal choices. Running a site for selling drugs shouldn't be illegal.

I'm not sure I understand your question. El Chapo will most likely die in prison. ( After serving 10-20 years) My point is that someone whose 'crimes' ( running a darknet drug market ) are far less than one of the most brutal cartel leaders should not be given such an insane sentence. ( Double life ) IMO the government made an example out of him; sentencing him unfairly.

Great work, interesting comparison. IMO most alts will go to zero over the next few years.

Mainstream adoption happens slowly but steadily, Bitcoin is not a race it is a marathon. Hang on HODLers

Mass adoption happens gradually. Bitcoin is not a race it is a marathon. IMO there will come a time when there are Bitcoin ATMs instead of bank ATMs and where prices are in Satoshi's not $$$

Use cash app and then withdraw to secure wallet.

I agree. We punish people with extreme sentences to make an example out of them, the modern equivalent of a public hanging or cutting the hands off a thief.

Adoption is growing. HODL

I've been verified for BTC withdrawal, it's super easy. Just drivers license and dob as well as last 4 of SSN. Got approved very quickly. Great way to fund exchange accounts like binance.

Lol, not a sprint.

I would agree that reforming the drug laws would be ideal, I'd definitely sign a petition for that.

Already signed, although not everyone agrees with what Ross stood for I think we can all agree that he doesn't deserve such a harsh sentence. Especially for someone so young.
