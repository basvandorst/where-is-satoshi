Not after they convert it into monero. And then back into some clean bitcoin.

It’s a little hard to understand your question but the movement of the btc occurs in the block chain. You don’t own any bitcoin you only know the private key which lets you move it. Anyone can move it if they know the key, and this is public record. If you move it into an exchange wallet (where the exchange holds the key) they know your identity. Bc you told them and linked it to you bank account. So yeah if you buy btc from coinbase and move it to you private ledger key/wallet, then use it to buy drugs, it’s traceable. The trail from a coinbase wallet linked to your name, to some private wallet, to some drug dealers wallet is traceable and publicly viewable by anyone. 
To wash it send some to a private wallet, then send that to a changley exchange and swap it for monero. The swap it back. Those are now different bitcoins. And those bitcoins are not linked to the original coins you had from coinbase. Once you have clean coin reimport back into coinbase or Gemini and sell for usd.

You realize we’re talking about washing the coins right? Anyone that controls the private key to the wallet controls the coins obvs. But if you want to cash them out to fiat you need an exchange. If you don’t wash the btc before importing into an exchange that converts to fiat, then the exchange can ID you. And upon subpoena by a government, you become ultra mega fucked. Converting to monero is a common untraceable way to wash coin. The paper trail of these btc to monero will be broken. Once you have monero, then you can buy eth, or btc, or whatever fiat conversion exchanges accept and cash out. Trick will be not to do it with too much at once. But 10 million at a time nobody can track.
