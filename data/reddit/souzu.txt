A CFD still needs a counterparty to accept the other end of the risk. Who would provide that service? Exchanges? Abra?

That's not a reasonable assumption. It requires each dev to hold thousands of coins to offset the lack of salary. Or enough other assets.
But even if it were, Falkvinge argument is still that they should work for miners for free. He is saying that they should implement someone else's idea of what will make the price grow, instead of their own, without compensation. And without enjoyment.

Not in the 100 meter dash.

Oh, I'm only talking about what the guy above me said. A working blockchain CFD would solve the problem of pegging to USD without being a custodian. It would require a price oracle.
The other claims sound kinda magical. Blockchain CFDs would not remove counterparty risk or expiry expectations.

A functional blockchain CFD would solve that problem. Not a simple problem though. You still need counterparties willing to take the opposite risk.

On top of this, Falkvinge completely discounts the ability of the miners themselves to put resources behind a hard fork. They have money, they have technical talent. If the miners wanted a hard fork, they could have written and deployed it by now.
According to him, it is the responsibility of developers to implement the hard fork miners claim to want. Not the responsibility of the miners to create working code and convince others to run it. If they want a hardfork so badly, 
This isn't a bunch of guys running a planned economy. Bitcoin developers published, built, and tested the changes they wanted to see. Hardfork proponents have not done that, despite having time and resources.
Sure, the market of miners has rejected Segwit. But they haven't offered any good alternatives. Falkvinge's argument boils down to "anyone with technical skill should be working for miners for free."
