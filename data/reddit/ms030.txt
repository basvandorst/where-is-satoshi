I've submitted the original version a few weeks ago, I have added a lot of different coin pairs since then. 
It fetched the price from the big exchanges and returns the weighted average. It updates the price every 30 seconds.

First time I hear about this, - and no I"m not trying to steal wallets!
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:41:32
They do not include volume in their API, that does not work with my current coding.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:09:41
Good news - just talked to my Korean business partner, he said, they will only ban BitcoinCash.

I have another site, that offers this:  (just click on the + icon)
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:52:20
You are right, I've added BTC/GBP. Will look into the other thing later. Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:41:54
Yea, will add that one too!
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:32:47
Fuck Paypal, hope Crypto will replace them completely.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:07:20
Nice one!
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:14:34
Every 60 seconds, for source please check the post above yours.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:09:37
I'll add that tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:03:51
Nice one!
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:54:55
"Your Coinbase account has been successfully deleted" :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:05:17
Thanks, should not be a problem, will look into that.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:22:54
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:18:14
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:02:52
Not yet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:55:01
For Coinbase please check the GDax price, it's the same platform. I'll  try to add other cryptos &amp; currencies later this week.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:12:12
Can you take a look?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:46:34
That's basically the "Fair Price" in the last row.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:56:08
Yea, definitely something worth adding/changing.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:33:47
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:12:51
There are many sites that offer similar data, I wanted to make a basic site that loads fast and has multiple coins/markets on the same page.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:17:01
Can't tell, it's the price that the API returns. Since they have low volume it does not have much of an effect on the Fair Value though.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:48:15
Yes, that was me ;)
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:35:58
Hehe, yea always having open 10 tabs myself ;)
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:12:56
Yes, I just updated the page. You can see the volume when you hover the cursor over the price.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:36:06
Maybe later, there are some passwords and stuff hardcoded. But the requests are very simple:
    $json = file_get_contents( " );
    $data = json_decode( $json, true );
    $usdbtc[ "Gemini" ] = number_format( $data[ "bid" ], 2 );
That's basically it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:47:38
Here is an exchange overview: 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:50:40
I can do that!
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:05:09
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:41:24
That number is really crazy, I wonder what their valuation is.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:23:10
Ah, did not know that one yet.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:57:41
Looks like Coinsquare does not off an API. I've added QuadrigaCX.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:19:49
Thanks ;)
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:34:37
Thanks for letting me know, will check that out tomorrow!
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:39:43
There is not a single REAL price... maybe this helps -&gt; 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:13:16
I just updated the page, it's now weighted. You can see the volume when you hover the cursor over the price.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:10:50
Will add that soon.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:20:07
Let me try
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:10:56
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:34:07
Yes, will add it later this week!
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:17:01
Welcome ;)
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:52:39
Thanks, it updates every 60 seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:33:08
Good to know, have removed coinbase. I'll try to add 24h volume ASAP.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:28:18
Do you also offer a mailing address in case that I want to throw away some cash?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:40:10
How does this one work: 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:24:02
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:28:24
Would have blocked her after "pigs get slaughtered"...
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:38:25
Totally missed that one, will add it right away!
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:32:52
That's more of a "keep in the background, low power consumption" version. The regular homepage should be responsive already.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:47:28
- Added more currencies and more exchanges. 
- The prices are updated every minute. 
- Fair Value estimate is weighted.
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:48:35
If only everyone bought under €6327
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:56:11
He probably lost it in some other bet before...
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:05:06
It can still go up to $11,000 within the next few hours... no problemo!
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:49:11
Can I interest you guys in some sugar futures?
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:34:58
You can add all kinds of coins and pairs.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:29:20
Thanks for the feedback. Every domain that contains crypto, coin, ... is already taken. After searching for an hour I went with .ooo. Never heard it before, but at least it's short.
