I think the server was shut down, and the app doesn't work without a server, that's why you can't log in... You'll need to restore your wallet with the 12 words passphrase in some other app or tool, e.g. I did that with Breadwallet which uses the same format.

You must be new here ;) Look through the history, every month there are posts like this, about them asking for detailed info or even disabling people's accounts because they just didn't like something about one transaction they did. I stopped using their wallet long ago because of this, I'm not going to risk losing access to my money because someone wants to be "more catholic than the pope"...
If you want a hosted wallet with more reasonable policies, try Circle, I never had any problems like this with them and I rarely hear bad things about them.

You guys realize this is gonna be reposted on The Other Sub as "current state of Bitcoin"? (hell, I wouldn't be surprised if it was there already)
@_date: 2016-04-12 23:20:31
Yup, it's a lot of responsibility. Too much for one guy to do it part time as a hobby after work... Things looked better back when it was developed as a flagship project of Hive Labs with proper funding, but the plan was to eventually start charging some small fees once we have many thousands of users using the app daily, and that just never happened...
It's a bit of a chicken and egg problem really. More people would use Bitcoin if it was more user friendly and the apps didn't suck, but to build great apps you need a lot of people using Bitcoin for it to make sense financially.

We've used BIP70 Payment Requests in the Hive wallet back in 2013 already. It's a good idea, it's mostly a UX improvement, I don't see how it increases risk of surveillance in any way. It basically just helps you send a payment correctly + adds some metadata about it so that your wallet can show on the transaction list who you paid and what for.

I think you just get some amount of coins if you produce solar power (verified by someone), or something like that... I'm not sure how it works. But it's one of the older coins that has survived so far, and it's one of very few that seem to be affected very little by crashes in the rest of the market (and rallies too for that matter), so it seemed like a good hedge.
I've done once some calculations on which coin had the lowest yearly drop in the last few years, and Solarcoin was on top (i.e. it dropped very little in 2014 when everything else crashed).
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:13:36

I don't think it has to... Are you assuming it will make collecting taxes impossible? Governments are doing a fairly good job at collecting taxes, they did that back when all transactions were done through cash, which was almost as hard to detect as Bitcoin. You don't have any income and you buy a big house - you're gonna get some questions about where you got the funds from... Hell, I'm paying taxes on the Bitcoin profits myself even though I could easily ignore it, partly because I'm worried they would somehow find out, and partly because I just want to be a good citizen.
So I think they'll figure something out. There's always VAT, property taxes etc.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:47:13
Yup, that's pretty much it. Old clients (like pre 0.13) see only the 1 MB part of the block so they accept it as legit, and everyone else sees larger blocks - we've seen up to 1.6 MB so far, could be around 2 MB on average later, and the more people use Segwit transactions the faster we'll get there.

Shit, man, so sorry... that weekend was fucking crazy. I was scared myself, but I didn't sell anything (I got rid of my remaining BCH at ~0.25). I just told myself that if Bitcoin gets killed by BCH, then oh well, I'm going down with the ship... I don't want to have anything to do with those guys, and if BCH is to become THE Bitcoin, then I don't want such Bitcoin anymore. But I tried to convince myself that there was too many smart and/or rich people backing our side for this to work in the end. Bitcoin has all the tech development, all the businesses and the investment funds, and they have some shady people, a couple of unknown devs and a lot of trolls. If the latter can beat the former, then the world is even more fucked up than I thought...
But I can imagine how easy it was to fall for it and panic. It was just stupid to sell all of your BTC and not keep half of it at least as a hedge...

Libertarian and left-wing/socialist/socialdemocratic aren't the only options available, there's plenty of space in between for moderate views. I'd consider myself a standard European center-right which a lot of popular EU parties are an example of (Merkel's party in Germany, Tusk's party - former PL govt).
I'm generally against regulation for the sake of regulating, excess taxes or spoiling people with too many handouts, I believe private companies in most cases are more effective than state institutions, and so on. On the other hand, I acknowledge that free market can't always fix all problems and can sometimes lead to pathological situations (e.g. monopolies) if it isn't controlled to some degree. E.g. I much prefer the EU healthcare system to the US one where you can be ruined financially by a minor accident.
As for Bitcoin - I'm honestly curious to see what's going to happen when it gets to the size where it can influence economies and countries... I won't dare to predict how it's going to work out, but it's definitely going to be interesting :) It fascinates me in this way, even though I imagine it could potentially lead to some major changes in political systems. I just feel like it might be a force that we won't be able to stop even if it gets out of control, so all we can do is get some popcorn and watch (ideally from the inside).
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:05:03


That's not really a good description I'd say... It has existed since 2011 and it's doing pretty well 6 years later, and perhaps the author didn't give it much attention in the past, but if you follow him now, he's pumping it like crazy, so he definitely doesn't seem to think it's going down (he left his job at Coinbase this year to focus on Litecoin only).

Today there was also news all over the Polish internet about a large bank BZWBK closing a customer's account for making transfers to an exchange, saying that it's not regulated so it's illegal. I know it's a common thing in the US, but we didn't have many such cases here - but I think they must regret it because they've done themselves a nice PR disaster...

You're making it seem like the probability of something bad happening to an exchange is absolutely minimal and not worth thinking about, and that's just not true. We have countless examples, from MtGox which partially caused the 2014-15 crypto winter, our Polish Bitcurex, to recent Bitgrail from which Nano still can't pick up itself. And various minor hacks which were small enough not to kill an exchange. Not to mention exchanges locking up people's funds because of KYC and stuff... Yes, most of the time nothing happens, but it happens often enough that if you're in this market for a few years, the probabilty that something like this will happen to you is trending towards 1.

Yeah, this pisses me off so much. Random people writing on blogs about altcoin trends: "here's some investment advice, but please note this is not an investment advice". Well it obviously is, so why all this bullshit... I guess in America you're just taught that you can sue everyone for everything (like for burning your mouth on hot coffee), so people are conditioned to be afraid of that. Where I live, most people probably never talk to a lawyer in their life unless someone really screws them over (or maybe for handling inheritance and such stuff).

This makes zero sense right now, 1000000 units for shoes is a way too large number. It's the same problem with paying 0.00001, but in inverse - you still can get the zeroes mixed up. Satoshis may start making sense when Bitcoin is maybe at $1M, but right now bits are much more appropriate.

Well, for me it's already 1 because I had some pretty large (in today's prices) sum on Bitcurex. My friend had a truckload of Nano bought for pennies and he kept it all on Bitgrail. I'm pretty sure if we did a poll of how many people who were in crypto since 2013 have lost anything anywhere at some point, it would be a double digit percentage.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:17:16
I guess they've done a test on the mainnet and it worked, but it's not officially usable there, or just not guaranteed to work yet (i.e. you could probably download a version from git and build it and it could work, but it could also delete your bitcoins / melt your computer / kill your cat or just not build at all).

Regardless what I think of Roger (and I better skip that part), he doesn't look to me like a person who would mass steal private keys this way...

Oh Americans, your single-axis political system is so funny... that's what you get for setting things up so that only two parties can ever hope to have any power. In Europe there are plenty of parties that are e.g. pro-life/anti-immigrant and want to raise taxes and give out benefits, and parties that want to cut taxes and spending but are also very open and liberal. And the funniest thing is when you use the word 'liberal' (from a root meaning 'freedom') to mean someone who tends towards more regulation and higher taxes...

I have mixed feelings about this. Going forward is good, but backwards compatibility is also needed. We're not talking about iOS version on iPhones which people use all the time and update regularly, but about money which people often put in a wallet and leave there for years. If Segwit addresses are required at some point, how are people supposed to use their funds that they put into cold storage in 2014 and haven't touched since?
@_date: 2018-09-22 01:27:24
Just updating to the latest bitcoin-core isn't enough - if a merchant, exchange or another company is using a node for their system, they aren't using it manually but they have some software integrating with it that calls some commands on the node interface. These commands are different for SegWit addresses, so this software needs to be updated and tested very thoroughly, that's why it takes a lot of time.

Electrum with an offline wallet is actually an extremely secure setup imho, I'm using this myself (though I have hardware wallets too). Although that's assuming the offline computer is really offline (but it could be e.g. a live Linux distro booted specifically for each session, though that makes the whole thing pretty complicated).
Another option could be an iOS wallet (e.g. Breadwallet) on an iOS device that isn't used for anything else (could be some cheap iPod Touch or an old iPhone) - not really cold storage, but still I'd put it pretty high on the list.
And in any case, spreading your funds across a few different kinds of wallets lets you avoid a situation where you mess up and suddenly lose everything somehow.

@_date: 2018-08-02 00:03:38
That's the only kind of scale that makes sense in crypto, since it grows exponentially, this makes the lines look somewhat close to straight. Otherwise, the latest bubble always looks huge and everything before looks like crypto didn't exist. We make or lose money based on percentage changes, not absolute changes - when it went from $10 to $20 it was a change comparable with going from $1000 to $2000, not from $1000 to $1010.

It kinda was, e.g. there's EtherDelta on Ethereum. I guess it's just that for Bitcoin you'd spend too much on fees if every trade was an on-chain transaction, there's just not nearly enough space on the blockchain to keep all that there.

And all of us here are just for the tech, right?
@_date: 2018-08-02 13:30:49
Yeah, so the algorithm works this way that the number of bitcoins mined is halved every 4 years, and it only gets to 1 satoshi (which can't be divided further) in something like 2140. By which time we'll probably be all living inside a computer or travelling to other stars or something... Of course the reward will be getting much smaller than it is now long before that, but the assumption is that the price will also be much higher than it is now. That, and as others said, fees are also supposed to be a significant source of income (they already surpassed mining reward for some brief periods in winter).

BitPay is a bad company, but about the payment request you should complain to the people who make the wallets you use that don't support it. I had support for that in a wallet I was building in 2013, so they had plenty of time...
@_date: 2018-08-02 00:50:49
I (try to) imagine how hard it would be, I was lucky to never really be any worse than at zero, with all profits erased, and even that is so incredibly frustrating... But I can tell you this - back in 2015 I really had moments when I was afraid this was all over, that we've lost the game and the experiment failed. I didn't feel that even once this time. With all the stuff happening lately with the institutonal investors etc., Bitcoin almost seems "too big to fail" at this point... (although I gotta say February was hard, but only because I realized I made some mistakes and might have to change some plans because of this).
Oh, and one more tip - contrary to what some "hold forever" people will tell you, showing you the Morpheus meme, don't be afraid to start selling bit by bit once you've made some nice gains. It makes things so much easier when you start having less at stake and you know that whatever happens, at least you've made a little money on this already.

I don't see a reason why it wouldn't in the current circumstances. I can imagine a scenario when this line would break down, but something way worse than the MtGox hack would have to happen. Without that, it should continue until all people that could possibly want to own Bitcoin already do, but I don't think we're even close to that.
Also, it's hard to say but this base line might not be straight, but slightly flattening as we go forward - but not nearly flat yet.

IMHO the key is not to avoid any hosted wallet, but rather diversification. Having a pile of bitcoins and keeping them all only on Coinbase is a bad idea, but keeping them all in a hot Electrum wallet on a computer that can get hacked by malware is also a bad idea.
Coinbase isn't so bad, they're a company with very good reputation and they seem to know their stuff. Just don't keep everything there. If you plan to have a lot of bitcoins, put at least half of them in cold storage (e.g. Electrum can help you set that up).
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:28:52

Check out bitcoinj:  Hive for Mac is built on top of it, and bitcoinj handles all the complex and dangerous stuff like generating and encrypting private keys, signing transactions, exchanging messages with the Bitcoin network etc. If you find a way to integrate a C# UI with JVM and bitcoinj, then you only need to call the right methods in bitcoinj API and you can focus on building a great UI.

The thing is, health isn't something where competition and free market can work, because it's not something you can choose to buy or not. It's not a TV where you can buy a cheaper or a better one, or hold off buying until next year, or decide not to buy at all. If you're sick, you will do whatever you need to do and buy whatever you need to buy right now, and if the hospitals are allowed to ask as much as they want for that, then they will, and you'll still pay whatever they say (unless you can't afford it, then you're screwed).

Each Bitcoin address has a matching private key that lets you access the bitcoins on this address. What OP says is that by having an account on Coinbase, you don't technically own the bitcoins there, because Coinbase holds all the private keys to them, so they could theoretically take them away from you, get hacked, lose them, be ordered by the government to block them, and so on. Of course the probability of that happening is small, but it exists. If you hold bitcoins in the kind of wallet that gives you and only you full access to them, then no one can take them away from you. (Though that also means that only you are responsible for securing them.)
@_date: 2014-07-26 14:25:46
Yeah, it's probably ok. The bitcoins you see on your Coinbase balance don't have to match any specific number of addresses, you just deposit them to their account and they manage them internally, they could possibly have just one big address with all of their customers' coins in one place.

Be prepared that a lot of buy/sell/hold decisions you make will turn out to be wrong and will make you angry if you take it too emotionally. Probably most decisions initially, but you don't become all-knowing even after a couple of years. It will all get up in the end, but can still crash and cause panic in the meantime. Don't rush things and make bad decisions worse by selling at the bottom or buying at the top. Ideally, at first just learn to buy and hodl and don't overthink it.

If it was the Hive wallet, there were a few independent versions with different architectures:
- the original Mac app (I worked on that one), released in January 2014 - it had a single address and no 12-word passphrase, but it should have told you to make a backup so you'd need to find a "bitcoinkit.wallet" file somewhere in your archive - if you find it, you should be able to open it with Multibit Classic (long unmaintained, but still available for download from multibit.org); it would probably be protected with a password too (normal password set up by you)
- the Android app which was developed independently as "Bridgewalker" earlier - I think it used the same underlying library and had the same backup format, but I'm not sure
- the web-based iOS and Android apps that came later (summer 2014) - those had a 12-word passphrase that should be compatible e.g. with Breadwallet, I think (and even if it isn't, when you have the 12 or 24 words it's just a matter of finding a right tool to extract the funds), and they had no separate backup file

It's not PGP signed. The Sparkle update system (the one that's currently broken...) verifies new downloads with a signature from the feed that we generate using our private DSA key and a public key included in the app.
The app is open source (the "github.com" in the link should give you a hint :), GPL-licensed, you can track the progress here: 
As for trusting us to write bug-free code - I can't really answer that (I wouldn't trust myself to write bug-free code...), but the entire backend part (network connections and wallet file management) is handled by a well known bitcoinj library by Mike Hearn, which has existed for about 3 years now and is used in multiple wallets. So there isn't that much we can mess up. Also, if you have backups, you should always be able to restore the keys from a backup.
@_date: 2014-11-04 11:57:29
Try Hive too, it's actually the only Mac wallet written in ObjC/Cocoa (although it does require Java, but only for the backend stuff, i.e. the UI is fully native). With SPV, so fast sync too.

About Hive Web: reading QR codes in HTML5 is tricky, because current version of Safari doesn't yet give you continuous access to the camera, you have to grab a photo first and then try it, but it usually works only after a few attempts.

To be honest, I admire Mike Hearn's patience... He's done so much work for this community - e.g. bitcoinj, Payment Protocol, now Lighthouse, he's doing everything he can to make Bitcoin more useful and increase user adoption, and he's getting so much hate for what he's doing. A lot of other people (including me) would have given up and quit long ago...
As far as I understand, the coin tracking thing wasn't something he was actively pushing for, it was just an idea he presented for brainstorming with good intentions, and he backed off when he saw everyone was against it.
And about "he wants the bitcoin dev model to change" - well, yeah, because too few people work on it right now, so why not change something? That was one of the reasons he wrote Lighthouse, to crowdfund development of various bitcoin features. How is that bad exactly?

@_date: 2014-11-25 16:29:13
I guess it's because they don't want to hold people's bitcoins themselves like Changebit does, because that might cause a lot of trouble once some regulations are introduced. Still, that kind of limits the usefulness of the service for people who don't want a Coinbase wallet.

@_date: 2014-03-27 10:07:12
I think if you're fine with Qt or Electrum, then this might not be for you - we've created it primarily for users who:
- have high standards for UI/UX and thought the existing wallets were ugly and hard to use
- are new to Bitcoin or not very technical at all
So the main goal is to make the UI nice and intuitive. This sometimes comes at the cost of feature-completeness though, so e.g. at this point we still only support one address, there's no key import/export, message signing etc., which is a problem for a lot of power users. (That said, it will all come in the coming months, starting with payment protocol support and BIP32 HD wallet sometime in Q2.)
As for security, all the innards are actually implemented by bitcoinj (shared with Multibit and some Android wallets), so it should be more or less as secure as any of those.

Do you really believe that being able to: 1) see recipient's confirmed name instead of a meaningless string of letters and numbers, 2) specify a refund address easily, 3) get a confirmation instantly instead of waiting potentially minutes in the shop, 4) being able to pay via bluetooth w/o an internet connection, etc. isn't already better than what we had before?

There are actually a lot of wallets with a single address or a small number of manually created addresses that work the way you've described. E.g.: Hive Mac/Android, Blockchain.info wallet, Multibit, and some Chrome plugin wallets. This is of course not an ideal solution, but for various reasons these wallets use a limited number of addresses at the moment (though I'm guessing long term most of them will be moving to BIP32).

I'm not sure what you mean about the insulting, I certainly didn't intend it to sound that way. I just meant our target is primarily people new to Bitcoin who aren't power users, and who prefer a simpler and more intuitive UI rather than a more complex one with a lot of features they don't need. Since you're already using BitcoinQt, I assumed it might not be the best wallet for you, but of course if you like it then great.
And I completely agree that our site isn't perfect at the moment, and that it could use some more information - we just didn't have access to a good desiger recently, so we did what we could. Fortunately, there's a big chance that this will change in near future.

But that's not why I got interested in the first place. I got into it because it excited me as a technology, a hacker-made Internet alternative of the existing currency systems. It's something so crazy that it just shouldn't work, and yet it seems to.

The fact that it's easier to hide income with Bitcoin and avoid taxes doesn't mean that Bitcoin is inherently incompatible with the very idea of taxes.

I'd suggest trying out Electrum too, you can also use it to set up a cold storage, but it's much simpler than Armory and doesn't require a full sync.

Wait, so they're processing payments by having people show QR codes of their *private* keys to the scanner, and then they make a transaction from their wallet on their behalf? Am I the only one who thinks this is kinda insane? Which part of "private" don't they understand?...

Hive developer here - to be honest I have no idea how this is intended to be done on OSX, I guess Apple just didn't think that it would be a common case for users to have multiple apps installed handling the same URI schemes... The most reliable approach that gave at least a consistent result was to just force assign the handler to Hive when it's started, which is what I did.
I guess I could add some kind of select box in the settings that would let you reassign this to a different app, but it would be stupid if every app had to have such setting - it should be somehow handled on the system level...

With Coinbase it's like if you asked someone you trust to install Breadwallet on their own iPhone, hold your bitcoins for you and give you easy access to them through a browser. But they hold the wallet directly and they can potentially run away with it. It might be more convenient, but it's definitely less secure.
That said, Coinbase is a serious company with a good reputation, and no one seriously expects them to pull a MtGox, but still...

Most of the people here who tell you to hodl and buy the dip have been here longer than you, and have seen periods like this and they know what always comes next and how it all looks later, looking back. Of course, it's more profitable to sell at the top and rebuy later, but no one ever knows when exactly is the right moment to sell and buy. "Hodl" doesn't mean it's the strategy that guarantees the best results, it means that by trading and trying to outsmart the market you're likely to lose more if you're not as good as you think. So holding at least lets you come back to the same price at some point in the future without losing anything, but only if you're patient enough, and being patient is the hard part.
@_date: 2014-12-07 02:17:00
The reason these coins were lost is precisely because this is not a web wallet that controls your keys - if the keys were managed by the server, the server wouldn't lose them.

I'm not going to check which country each user is from, that's ridiculous. If you go e.g. to France and you buy a car there, does the car vendor ask you for a passport and then check the laws of whatever place you're from to make sure they allow selling cars to its citizens? Or do they just follow French law regardless of who their customers are?

Some random google-translated news stories:
A drunk guy with a knife was threatening the police, they fired warning shots, which scared/confused him and they were able to stop him, no one got hurt in the end. If this was in the US, he'd most probably be dead.
Policewomen shoot warning shots at a guy escaping in a car, he then stops the car and runs away on foot and then they catch him.
And something about law changes reintroducing warning shots - it says a policeman is now only allowed to shoot someone without firing a warning shot and shouting "stop or I'll shoot" if there's no time for the warning shot or they can't do that safely. Which of course is open to interpretation, but it's obvious that if you do that then you will have some explaining to do.

@_date: 2014-10-30 11:42:39
Don't worry, this is normal :) It takes time to get a grasp of all of this.
Easiest way to buy bitcoins right now, IMHO: Circle or Coinbase. They've expanded recently and are now available in a lot of countries, especially Circle, and both have very user friendly UIs. On Circle you can buy with a credit/debit card without any additional verification.
You could also try exchanges (there are dozens of them, depends on which country you're in, Bitstamp and Kraken are very popular), but you'd have to deal with a bit more complexity, possibly more KYC verification etc.
Wallets: for now you can keep the coins on Circle/Coinbase, it's not the most secure option, but probably the simplest one, and they're both reputable companies. When you're more experienced, you can consider moving some of them e.g. to a Blockchain.info wallet (also web-based, but they don't have access to your money), or the Coinbase Multisig Vault released yesterday, or a desktop wallet (Electrum, Hive), or a mobile wallet (Breadwallet, Hive, something for Android).

Yes, unlike the Dropbox adapter, the Time Machine adapter doesn't actually do the backup, it just checks for Time Machine backup status. The point is that it will tell you if backups aren't being done or TM is disabled or something like that (we'll probably add some more annoying popups later that show up even if you don't open the Backup Center manually).

Sorry, we don't actually support any kind of key/wallet import in any version of Hive. I have no idea which apps support this specific format.
As for cold storage, Electrum can make offline wallets and syncing is very quick. You can also consider buying a Trezor.
@_date: 2014-07-10 23:27:55
I don't know if you can get a private key from Coinbase, and even if you can, it's as you say - they will still have it. If you want to own your bitcoins completely, the only way is to use a wallet that doesn't store the keys on any server (desktop wallets, most mobile wallets, and some HTML5 wallets).

We're assuming that restoring from backup is something that would only be done rarely in emergency situations, so it shouldn't be a common enough use case to require a UI for this. If someone asks us for help, we'll tell them what to do. If this becomes a regular problem then we'll add a UI for that.
I'm not sure how it will work with BIP32, but I'm guessing it will work like in Electrum, i.e. the seed is random and generates the key directly, and the password is used for encrypting it on the disk.

To be fair, a multisig wallet wouldn't have helped with today's Blockchain.info fuckup - if I understand this correctly, if you can decode the private key from a transaction, it doesn't matter what kind of address it is.

I think the main hope about Circle is that they will be better at marketing. I'm not saying Coinbase isn't good at it, but Circle seems really determined to reach people who are not into Bitcoin yet at all and make it a mainstream thing. (Might be just my impression though since they're still largely vaporware at this point.)
The point is, they don't need to have more features than Coinbase, they just need to be able to reach more people.

That sounds like an edge case to me - normally I'd either transfer money from my account to someone's account, or give them cash, but I'd never think of going to someone's bank and depositing cash in the bank office to their account...

@_date: 2015-05-18 11:07:12
How the hell is this even legal? We like to complain about taxes and tax agencies here in Europe too, but I don't think any tax agency here would even conceive the idea of taking someone's money just for matching some kind of pattern of deposits and not giving all of it back if the person was innocent. Even in case of clear tax fraud there's usually just a set percentage rate that you have to pay as a penalty.

Could it be that you still need to somehow send money between the offices, because the input/output will never be balanced in all directions? E.g. if more people send in Chicago and more people receive in Tokyo, some fiat money would still need to flow from Chicago to Tokyo. With Bitcoin the costs of doing that should be noticeably smaller.
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:22:54
Wow, nice :) I asked them last year if they could accept Bitcoin, but I guess it was too late to set it up, though they did say that a few other people had already asked them about it. Nice to see they managed to do it this year.
In case you haven't heard about it (which I guess most people here didn't) - WOŚP is a huge event, it's impossible to miss it on the Grand Finale day (this Sunday), everywhere you go in every city you see people with the boxes gathering donations, and people with red heart stickers attached to their clothes. They gather a fuckton of money each year, and probably a significant percentage of hospitals use at least one machine or some other thing bought using those funds. So help them if you can, it won't go to waste.

It seems this wasn't an idea of someone at the top, but rather of people in that office specifically, so the HQ might not even know about it yet (though I suspect they will by Sunday, and they might even mention it on TV).
They say the address is managed by some kind of partner of theirs that has been helping them for the last 10+ years, and that the coins will be sold on an exchange and added to the pool of everything that WOŚP Bydgoszcz manages to collect.

@_date: 2015-01-11 20:04:06
I've read that and I still don't understand how they can be so sure they're going to win. If the large block blockchain becomes accepted as THE Bitcoin blockchain by majority of miners, exchanges, payment processors, wallets etc., then it's irrelevant what happens on the old blockchain and how much bitcoins you have there, because from the perspective of the majority of Bitcoin community, whatever is there will not be bitcoins anymore.
(That will be scary and I'll probably short the hell out of it before that happens, because the price might plummet until shit gets sorted out, but I think it will get sorted out in the end.)
@_date: 2015-01-11 12:26:37
Isn't that kind of too harsh? Can't you, like, just send warnings the first time or something? I imagine a lot of people have no idea that such rules exist, I've been here for over a year and I still don't fully know what's actually ok and what isn't. Banning someone just because they moved from one subreddit to another and pressed an arrow sounds like an overkill to me, especially if the person might not have realized they're doing anything wrong.

You want to send your friend Mike 1 mBTC. You could just send it and pay the fees. However, coincidentally, your other friend Bill owes you 5 mBTC and Mike owes Bill 3 mBTC.
So instead you just agree to take 1 mBTC off the two debts, and now Bill only owes you 4 and Mike owes Bill 2 mBTC.
You're now owed 1 mBTC less than before, so it's like you've spent it. Mike only owes 2 mBTC, so it's like he got 1. For Bill it balances out, so nothing changes for him, he was just a middleman. The result is the same as if you've sent that 1 mBTC to Mike, but no transaction was actually sent. Also, no one else apart from you three needs to know about it.
Scale it up to thousands of connected users with multiple "debt" channels each, and make everything completely automatic and secure, and able to connect through several people one after another instead of just two connections, and you get LN. (Also, in real LN Bill wouldn't actually know who exactly is paying whom, just that the numbers on the two sides have changed.)

It increases block size from 1MB to a more dynamic value around 2MB on average. There's another increase by 2x to ~4MB on average as a part of "Segwit2x" in November, but Core doesn't agree on that, so it will hard fork to a new blockchain.

Firmware upgrade always tells you that you should have your seed somewhere, even though it's usually not needed, because it could potentially be. And AFAIK there's no way to test the seed inside a configured wallet.
I've looked for this literally 3 hours ago, and I only found this:  I downloaded the linked "bip39” page to a pendrive, I opened it on a Linux booted from live cd (not connected to any network) and I used the page to enter the seed and check if the generated addresses below match what I see in the wallet.

I think you need not only all Segwit transactions, but specially formatted Segwit transactions, so it rather won't happen in practice. Although it could if someone tries hard to artificially make the blockchain grow faster for some reason...

@_date: 2017-08-24 14:23:46
BCH/BCC people have decided to solve the problem in a simpler way, by not introducing SegWit and instead just bumping up the block size limit to 8MB. The core team wanted to do it the way they did, because they believe raising block size too much is dangerous, and introducing the changes that just went through will be better for Bitcoin in the long term. They couldn't agree on that, so BCH people have decided to go their own way with their own blockchain and coin.
For now they have BCH and we have upgraded Bitcoin in which block sizes should start increasing and fees should start falling gradually over the next weeks. And Segwit also enables the Lightning Network, which should also start rolling out alpha versions fairly soon. What happens in November with the second hard fork - no one knows...
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:14:41
Yup. And I think I've read that the fee algorithm is also slightly changed to incentivise decreasing the UTXO count by using more inputs and less outputs, or something like that (but that isn't something the user will usually have control over).
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:41:18


Oh for fuck's sake, this is my government's level of propaganda…
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:19:25
Not sure, but I think that's the plan... There might be block size increases by hard fork later, but only done very carefully. I watched a presentation about LN this week, and they calculated there that for billions of people doing a few transactions every day we'd need like 20+ GB (not MB) blocks, so a whole multi-TB disk filling up every day. And then you'd have probably only a few nodes in total, at Google, Amazon and so on... so we can't get there by just increasing block size and not fundamentally changing how we do things (even though I'll miss those early days when I could sent transactions back and forth all day for testing, because I was too lazy to switch to testnet...).
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:19:46
I'm not sure about on disk size, but transferred size definitely goes up to 2 MB on average and up to 4 MB in an extreme case (for updated nodes). I looked it up just in case I misunderstood it, this article explains it well: 
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:53:14
As I understand, It should be above 2 MB on average once Segwit addresses are common, and 4 MB is the theoretical maximum. If someone wants to attack the network by filling blocks for some reason, they can find a way to make blocks close to 4 MB. When the devs are considering long term effects of such important changes, they have to consider worst case scenarios, especially if they can easily happen if someone wants them to. How is this lying?
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:33:35

These would not be 2MB blocks, they would be 4-8MB blocks, in contrast to 2-4MB blocks we're going to have starting this Wednesday. Please read: 
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:28:01
As I understand, there are 2 main issues:
- increasing block sizes has a hidden cost, in that it makes it more expensive and harder to run full nodes and mining, because the disk/memory space and bandwidth required are increased; you have to be very careful not to push this too hard too fast, restricting running nodes and mining to a much smaller (and easier to control) group of people
- simply increasing block size as BCH did (not through the workaround that Segwit uses) requires a hard fork, because it changes block validation rules in an incompatible way, so it splits the chain into another automatically; if you don't want to create a situation of a civil war in the community (like we got now), this should only be done in a way that everyone is on board, devs, miners, exchanges, wallets etc. and everyone switches to the new version and leaves the old one behind (and that's super hard to achieve for obvious reasons)
@_date: 2018-10-13 00:50:12

@_date: 2017-08-11 11:22:45
There's one thing I'm confused about, please correct me if I'm wrong... As I understand, what I'm seeing here is payment channels, which were actually possible in Bitcoin for quite some time (see e.g.  it's just that no one bothered to really use them in practice; and Lightning Network is some larger structure built on top of payment channels, which connects multiple channels to let you push funds through a path of several channels, although the video here doesn't show anything like that - do I understand that correctly? Do you intend to have something like I mentioned in the app?
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:00:56
It does increase the block size. That's one of the reasons the devs resist an additional increase, because you could potentially spam the blockchain with almost 8MB blocks then.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:52:23
Ok, let's imagine an extreme case: all miners leave, and there's only one guy left with a single ASIC machine connected, and he keeps mining. Are you saying he would also be producing blocks every 10 minutes (without a difficulty change)?
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:15:04
I thought at first this was about  and I was a bit confused...
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:54:28
Yes, 2 MB on average, but blocks close to 4 MB can be made if you're trying to attack the network by filling the blocks for some reason. When the devs are considering long term effects of such important changes, they have to consider worst case scenarios.

Uh... how? If you take any coins you don't have a right to take, the full nodes on the network will completely ignore this transaction, even if it's included in a block, so you may think you have taken someone's Bitcoins, but no exchange or business will accept them, so they won't really be Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:07:12

The silent majority will probably keep using their current wallets in their current versions, so they will keep connecting to the core chain, because it will be the one that's following the rules that Bitcoin network had for the last few years.

Look, I'm a Bitcoin maximalist too, I didn't own any altcoins until this month, but at this point it would be insane not to acknowledge that they exist and will exist whether we like them or not. Making it easier to build Bitcoin products that can also handle other coins, especially if it's basically zero extra effort, will just lead to better products, so it will help everyone, including Bitcoin.

Segwit doesn't just make the blocks simply larger like in BCH, it makes more space for transaction signatures, but only for transactions being sent from segwit-compatible addresses. You need to first send coins to such address (and these addresses didn't exist before today), and most wallets don't even allow you to create such addresses yet - most of them are working on this right now and promised to release new compatible versions very soon. But it will still take some time before people switch to this type of transactions (though I suppose e.g. exchanges will do this fairly quickly, because they can save money on this).

I expect them to start coming down next week, not immediately, but gradually once more Segwit addresses are used, blocks get bigger and the backlog gets shorter. I'm planning to move my Trezor coins to a Segwit-compatible subwallet immediately, not sure if other wallets support it yet.

If the PC is infected, you should assume it can potentially read and affect anything that happens on it, including in VMs that run on it - it might not be as easy, but just in principle, a fresh system in a VM doesn't count as offline/airgapped.

Either the miner get a higher fee for a given transaction, or the sender pays less for it, both can't be true at the same time... As far as I understand, you pay a lower fee for a SW transaction than you would for a normal one, so the miner gets less. But more SW transactions fit in a block than normal transactions, so in total a miner will get more fees for a block full of SW transactions than they would for a block full of normal ones.

Wow, looks pretty complex, nice work!
I've been working on something like this myself since January:  - it's mostly meant to sync and combine transaction histories from all sources, but it also lets you e.g. check balances, and maybe I'll add open orders later too. But only read-only actions in general, for safety and simplicity. It only has a command line interface though (but it's easier to set up :).

@_date: 2017-08-18 22:38:10
I still don't understand what you're trying to say. A mining company that has e.g. 10% of the hashrate produces blocks on average every 100 minutes at a given difficulty level, so in total one of them produces a block every 10 minutes on average. If half of them drop off, the rest will still produce blocks every 100 minutes, but there will be less of them producing those blocks. A better comparison would be a group of builders laying bricks to build a wall, and if half of them leave, it will take longer to finish that wall.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:30:36
As far as I understand, it does quite a lot to increase capacity directly too, but only if you format the addresses and transactions in the right way, so it will not be an immediate change. But e.g. if exchanges implement this quickly, and they have a motivation to do so, the fees should go down.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:23:42
Well, it's all a matter of calculating risks, no Bitcoin is ever 100.0% secure :) Whatever wallet you use, the ultimate hack is always to capture you and demand your coins as ransom for your life ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

But the difficulty only updates every two weeks, so if half of them left right now, blocks would be generated every 20 minutes on average, so it would take 8 days instead of 4 to get to the activation point, because the time is measured in blocks, not hours.

But that would mean Breadwallet would let me do transactions on a chain where the coins I'm sending could potentially be stolen, in this hypothetical situation. Since it can't know what new validation rules this chain is introducing, it should not let me send transactions there unless it knows it's safe.

There is zero chance of $2000 IMHO (except maybe for a brief moment), $3000 is the worst it could possibly go (but it doesn't seem likely). Everyone talks about 2014, but we were falling from much higher then (relatively speaking), two bubbles one on top of another.

It's probably a good idea to move out of Bittrex indeed. Although we can't be sure the same won't happen sooner or later with Binance - with Malta being part of the EU which also likes to regulate everything... But at least IMHO there's a smaller risk they'll do it in a shitty way like Poloniex. I usually prefer Binance over Bittrex anyway because Bittrex login process is super annoying with that "your IP address has changed and you need to log in second time" thing...
I really don't mind exchanges knowing who I am, but I'm not gonna send my ID scans to someone over the internet, since I don't trust them to handle and store it securely and never leak it to hackers.
And I also started moving almost everything I had on exchanges to local wallets after some Chinese exchanges almost fucked me over - I always treated this "not your keys, not your bitcoins" rule rather loosely as "don't keep the majority of your coins on exchanges", but right now I've decided to only keep there what I'm actually trying to trade and deposit anything more only when I actually need it there.

If you look at a very long term log chart, there is a kind of base level trend line that we never went below since at least 2011, which is probably based on some kind of true network value of BTC, and it keeps going up, but slowly. We get often get above it a lot, when the market goes crazy, but then we get punished by having to suffer until that "real" price catches up with what the market price got pumped to.
In 2013 it went straight from one spring bubble to a second autumn bubble without going back down, so since the second bubble started from an already inflated level, it got us way too high in the end, and it took us a long time to get back closer to reality. Now, the top of this bubble wasn't as high, so we don't have as much to fall down to the "real" level (which is somewhere around 3k I think) as we did back then. (Of course we don't have to get down there at all, just like we didn't after spring 2013.)

Yeah, like the other comment says, these things won't necessarily appear in the commit list immediately. If you're writing something relatively simple like a web app for a blog, or an iOS app that shows a list of some things, you just sit down and start coding commit after commit, because you pretty much know what and how you want it done, and you figure out the rest on the way. This would include features here like adding some new command line operation to Bitcoin Core (that end users normally don't see) or adding some buttons or switches to its UI.
But for something like an upgrade to crypto signatures of Bitcoin, you instead need months/years of thinking, planning, discussing, reviewing, testing, prototyping etc., and only once you settle on some exact plan you start coding the actual stuff. You really don't want to screw up everything by skipping some of the steps...
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:20:30

Higher price also means that even if B2X is e.g. 0.2 of BTC, mining B2X will still be profitable for them, which it might not be if BTC was at $3000. So they will not be forced to switch to the more profitable chain as quickly.

Yeah, that's the whole point of why most people stick with Core in all fork debates - this shit is f\*cking hard, even for software, which is hard in general, so we really need the absolutely best and most experienced people working on this, and we need to let them progress on this as carefully as they need to. Even if we'd all prefer if some things changed much faster or disagree with some of the policies.

Right now it looks like Coinbase might be getting more influence, not less, with things like this:  - if there's another contentious fork in a few years, who's going to bet against all this money they will be keeping there?

I was totally expecting this Uncle Bob... 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:01:11
I'm kind of letting Coinbase off the hook myself, since they were going [back]( and [forth]( on this, so they were clearly [unsure how to handle this best]( Although of course they are partially to blame too.
The Xapo CEO also seems to at least partially regret the whole thing, I read that as a semi-apology: "[I got too impatient](
The worst offenders IMHO were:
- BTCC / Bobby Lee with his horrible offensive AMA ("[If your version of bitcoin is easily attacked, then I suggest for you to look into other choices](
- BitPay, which [told the users of their Bitcore software]( that they need to "upgrade" to the latest version of Bitcoin Core in a horribly misleading way, without even mentioning that this was code from the btc1 repo that would put them on a different chain after a hard fork, or that there was any fork at all (the footer note was added later)
- Blockchain.info, who made [an announcement]( that they would call the chain with more hashrate "Bitcoin", which called it just an "upgrade" and IMHO downplayed what was really happening
- BitGo CEO Mike Belshe, who was one of the strongest supporters (or perhaps even leaders) of 2x, against his CTO and lead dev who were very loudly against it, and who wrote some pieces of horrible propaganda that they're "[keeping the community together]( and "[upgrading
Bitcoin (...) and taking the unity path to keep the Bitcoin
network united without a chain split]( unwilling to admit until the final announcement that there was clearly no consensus around this change and it wouldn't be a painless "upgrade"

It would destroy both coins, because at the moment everyone assumes they are lost forever for whatever reason and will never be used to dump the coin to the ground. If we knew some of them are ready to be used at any moment, there would be a constant danger forever.

Looks nice, looking forward to trying it :) I've played with Delta and Crypto Pro today, and they're the best I've tried so far, but there's certainly space for improvement.
All I need really is:
- a list of my tracked cryptos
- showing current price and +/- % change daily
- and how much $ I own / have gained in a given coin and in total (after I enter the amount and cost)
- and all of this with a nice design
- ideally also price alerts, Apple Watch and iCloud sync :)
I've used Coinfolio before, it's pretty good in terms of layout and approach, except it's shitty because it's not a native app, so it feels broken all the time. It forgets the numbers after a restart and the scrolling is terrible.
I also prefer Coinfolio's simpler approach to portfolio in that you only enter the total amount and cost, Crypto Pro and Delta expect you to enter all transactions one by one, which would be too much work (I guess you can just enter one fake transaction with today's date and total amount, like I did, but it's kind of a workaround).
I've settled on Crypto Pro so far, Delta looks nicer but the fonts are a bit too small for me and the process of entering transactions is a bit complex.

3 outputs. That's why if you receive a lot of small transfers it might be hard to spend the money, and people often wait for periods when the fees are very low to consolidate the outputs (because the more outputs you use, the bigger the transaction in terms of kb, so the bigger the fee).

Yeah, the problem with this fractal is that:
- this was the *second* bubble, and at that point we were much higher above the long term trendline that now (basically we were two bubbles above the level and this time we were one bubble above it)
- what followed was IMHO largely influenced by the MtGox shutdown, which discouraged a lot of people from crypto in general
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:37:40
This. I always thought "what you can afford to lose" was pretty vague... It's not a 0/1 thing, it's a spectrum between "I'll be totally ok and laugh at the loss" and "I'll have to live in a cardboard box and eat food from a trash can", and everything in between. If you don't risk even a little bit, you probably won't gain much either.

You don't need the Bitcoin Core wallet (the one that downloads the full blockchain) just to make one transaction, most people don't run one. There are light mobile wallets for iOS and Android like Breadwallet, or you can even just send the transaction straight from the exchange / online wallet where you buy the BTC (e.g. Coinbase).
Bitcoin divides up to 8 decimal places, so the smallest currently possible to use unit is 1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC, which is worth fractions of a cent.
If you pay someone for something with Bitcoin, the usual approach is that at some point they take the current rate, convert the price to BTC and tell you the specific amount to send, e.g. 0.009 BTC, and you send that amount within the next hours/days, whatever it's worth at that point (if they accept Bitcoin, they kind of implicitly accept the risk of sudden exchange rate changes in the meantime, as long as you keep it within a reasonable timeframe).

To be honest, there is no way to have a completely 100% secure wallet on a desktop that's connected to the internet... You are the weak link, and there's always the risk that you'll be tricked to download malware from somewhere (even e.g. searching on google for a known app and getting directed to a wrong place), and then it's game over. You shouldn't keep more than small amounts on desktop computers.
Where you should keep most of your coins:
- hardware wallets (Trezor, Ledger)
- mobile wallets, preferably iOS (NOT jailbroken), e.g. Breadwallet - I'm not an expert in Android security so I don't know how possible it is to keep it secure
- wallets set up offline on a disconnected computer, but that's pretty advanced stuff

A blockchain held in a Microsoft database is completely, utterly pointless.

Yeah, I know... I think the best hope is that these and different, new kinds of wallets will just become more and more user friendly, to the point where a normal non-techie can easily use them.
I don't expect desktop wallets to ever be as secure, because PCs are by design built to allow the user full control, and that's great but also the source of the problem. With platforms like iOS you have the opposite - we have a walled garden and a locked up platform that's frustrating for some people, but the upside is that it's much easier to secure. And the current trend anyway is that more and more people only or mostly use phones and tablets outside of work anyway, so maybe it won't be as hard.

I've looked at Mint a while ago, it looked ok-ish, but still not nearly on the same level as Mac... (besides, I was always on the KDE side and hated Gnome/GTK, but KDE kind of lost the war). And tbh at this point I'm too deeply in the Apple ecosystem (habits, bought apps, data stored in iCloud, and I'm still officially an iOS/Mac app developer even though I mostly just read crypto reddits these days) and any switch would be a massive change and I would need a really good motivation to even consider that.

Thanks for posting this. As someone who once implemented BIP70 support in a wallet (Hive), it's annoying to see it constantly presented as some kind of evil conspiracy... For me back then, this was mostly about being able to pass a lot of additional info about the payment (which wouldn't fit in a bitcoin: URL) back to the payer before they send the money, so that they feel more certain that they're paying the right merchant for the right things; see the screenshots here:

TheBlueMatt mentioned that one option would be just paying the miners to "buy" some hashrate. If they only choose based on profit, there's some finite amount of money that would make them switch at least for some amount of time, although I can't estimate how much would that be.
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:49:02
Yeah, it's not recommended to keep the majority of your coins on exchanges or online wallets long term. Try e.g. Electrum, Breadwallet, Mycelium. If ~$100/€100 isn't too much for you, hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger are even better.

No approval != illegal. The question is whether we're only allowed to do things that the governments have told us we may do, or if we're generally free to do what we want unless it was explicitly made illegal.

Gox crashed in February when we were around $600. A correction brought us only from $1100 to $600, the rest was due to MtGox. I don't think we would have gone down to $160 if it wasn't for MtGox, this event was a massive negative change.

I don't think you understand what 'exponentially' means... Yes, there were 2x more bitcoins per block and the difficulty was much lower, but the price was also much much lower (over 30x lower than the current price at the bottom). The situation was the same, miners never work at super high profit margins for a long time, because then you get more miners and things balance out. When profits drop, some miners will drop, the difficulty will go down and it will balance out again, same as it always did. They won't suddenly switch off all at once within one hour.

UASF meant rejecting blocks from miners that didn't signal Segwit, but since everyone started signalling Segwit, it didn't have any effect even though technically some people enabled that blocking, because there was nothing to reject. So in a way it both did and didn't happen... and there's no way to tell for sure if it would have worked otherwise.

What else have we been arguing about since Friday and what else has pushed the price on Chinese exchanges a few hundred dollars lower than on the others since Friday (look at the BTC/CNY chart and the cliff on Sep 8)? Of course it's the China ban. We don't know what % of what we hear is true, but the uncertainty that we can potentially lose 1/3 of the market is why it's been falling for the last few days.

Here in Poland the general assumption you should have is that if anything happens to your card, the bank will probably screw you over... they will gladly sell you some kind of card insurance for a few bucks per month, but if you don't get it, tough luck. That's why I was confused at first when I heard about card chargebacks on r/bitcoin, because it's not really a thing people do here (I've heard very recently that it does actually seem to work, but that's probably only because the request is passed to the card service and the bank hasn't got any say in this).

I found this info just when I was considering mining ETC too, because at that point it seemed the most profitable, but I gave up on the idea.  I was also thinking about mining Monero too, but it didn't work with my GPU for some reason (or maybe I just have too much shit launched on my computer already…) and I calculated that mining on the CPU wouldn't make me enough to bother. I don't have any custom machine for mining, I've never really mined anything (I joined BTC too late for it to make sense), just wanted to try if I can make something extra on my MacBook. But in the end, I make much more money just hodling BTC than I could ever do mining, so... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
If I wanted to mine something seriously, I'd probably go with Monero, seems to be still fairly profitable and it's a nice coin overall.

@_date: 2017-10-07 14:43:55
BT2 is the name of a temporary token on Bitfinex that's used for determining what price to expect from a real token later, it's not a ticker for the real Segwit2x. And "btc1" is the name of their repo on GitHub. But yeah, it would be nice to use B2X consistently now and not e.g. S2X now that Bitfinex has kind of made that ticker official.
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:21:09
I'm thinking that BCH's fall might also be working in our favor in terms of the B2X fork. If people see that one hard fork, which had fairly large community support and almost 50% miner support at some point ended up crashing like this, they might think twice before selling their BTC for another fork token this time...
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:46:20

It will be tradeable on some exchanges, even if only on the shitcoin ones, but it's definitely waaay behind BCH on the seriousness scale, so I seriously doubt Coinbase will care about it at all. So if you want it, take your money out before the fork.
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:49:02
Yeah, it's not recommended to keep the majority of your coins on exchanges or online wallets long term. Try e.g. Electrum, Breadwallet, Mycelium. If ~$100/€100 isn't too much for you, hardware wallets like Trezor or Ledger are even better.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:14:39
Not selling, but e.g. running their version of the Qt client on your computer to get the coins split from the BTC you had in your Core wallet, stuff like that.
@_date: 2017-09-29 23:41:00

@_date: 2017-10-06 15:01:21
This is typical lawyer language, you can see that in any software license for example, that there's a section at the beginning defining some keywords - meaning that e.g. the word "license" or "software" used in the rest of the document will mean specifically this license or that software, so that they don't have to repeat more precise terms every single time. So this here just means that *in the following text* B2X refers to such token as defined. This doesn't say that this token will be listed as B2X on the exchange.

If they're on the same address, yes, they can move together or stay, so you might have to repeat it a few times (sending to another of your addresses). Once you're lucky and you managed to get one transaction to confirm only on BTC and another only on B2X, you have the coins on different addresses, so from that moment you can safely send the B2X coins anywhere, because there are no BTC there and they won't ever be there (since the B2X chain transaction is no longer valid on BTC, because there are no coins on the input address).

I'd imagine that just selling the BTC on any other exchange once and buying it immediately again should be enough, right? That should break the chain since it won't be the same bitcoins, so it shouldn't be visible on the blockchain. Of course someone with access to that exchange's database can make the connection, but as I understand, OP is only asking about how to hide the coins from Coinbase, and Coinbase (hopefully) doesn't have access to other exchanges' internal databases.

It's actually pretty normal in Europe to be neither on the left nor the right, it's a shame that in the US you kind of feel forced to choose one or the other, because there are no centrist parties. Like, here in Poland I'd say a good 1/3 absolutely hates the current right-wing govt, but would also not be comfortable voting for someone who wants easy access to abortion, gay marriages with adoption rights and so on. The problem though is that for a lot of people on the right, everyone who doesn't agree with them 100% is a leftist... (kind of like in the US some people call everyone else cucks, as I understand).

That's how I see this too - it was created to be independent of the existing financial system, so if something seriously blows up in that system, Bitcoin theoretically should be a stable island, like gold. But there's also this effect that when investors get scared, they run back to USD (even if USD is the problem) - here in Poland USD slowly fell down to almost 2 PLN before 2008, and then in 2008 it jumped back towards 4 and it was bouncing between 3-4 PLN since then (and we were the one country in EU untouched by the crisis). So it's quite possible that in case of a huge new crisis crypto will first crash, with everyone running away from "new, unsafe, speculative assets", and only sometime later it will go up once people realize it's holding up above some support levels and might actually stay there while everything else sinks.

No replay protection doesn't mean it's not possible to split, just that it's not simple. The two chains still work independently and they won't keep every block in sync with a matching block on the other chain. So you send one transaction on one chain and another on the other chain (sending same coins elsewhere), and you wait. If they both confirm on their chains and aren't copied, it worked, if not, you repeat until it works...
(That's without any replay protection at all - with the banned address thing it's simpler, though still not simple enough.)

I've been basically 100% Linux for like 5+ years (2002-08), and I went through several distros (Mandrake/iva, Fedora, Suse, Debian testing, Mepis, Kubuntu), but then when I discovered Macs, it was like a breath of fresh air. In Linux something always didn't work, something always randomly broke when installing updates, or required googling for manual configuration, the apps were basic or incomplete or not integrated with each other or had unintuitive design/UX or looked like shit and so on... In the best case it felt like a cheap imitation of a real OS that just happened to work this time.
I loved the idea of people building such thing from scratch by themselves for free and giving it away for others to use and contribute to, but in the end the desire of using something that looks and works great won over the open source purity... I even saw some friends from work who were die-hard Linux users and laughed at us Mac fans and swore they would never switch finally break and move to Mac because it allowed them to spend less time messing with the system and have something that just works and focus on the actual stuff they wanted to build.

It doesn't prevent HTTPS connections, it can only try to trick you to open a fake HTTP site instead of the real HTTPS one, and it may only work with some sites and in some cases (and if you aren't careful). It's the same as when you open to a non-encrypted WiFi e.g. at the airport.

There are already a couple of independent (although not as popular) full node implementations. They aren't a problem because they're operating on the same blockchain, same coin, they're getting the same blocks with the same transactions. 2X will have a separate blockchain from the point of the split, so it will be a new coin, with different price per unit, sucking life out of the current BTC.

Where is the line drawn from?
@_date: 2018-07-29 00:38:20
You'll probably spend it all on fees.
@_date: 2018-07-14 15:29:48
It's like if you get $5 from 40 people and you put it all in your wallet. You have $200, but you also have 40 pieces of paper in your wallet, because the money each person gives you is completely independent of what you got from other people. So the wallet got kind of thick now, and it's more convenient to exchange those 40 notes for a few larger ones if you can.
Similarly in Bitcoin, each transaction you receive gives you a separate "banknote" with some bitcoins. It doesn't cost anything to keep them, but it costs more in fees to spend them than one large one, so it makes sense to make use of periods when fees are low to exchange those smaller banknotes into larger ones, so when you actually need to spend them later when fees might be larger, you only pay for 1 and not for 40. (Unlike with banknotes you don't actually exchange them with anyone, but just send all those smaller pieces to one new address.)
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:11:33
That might be the plan, but I don't think it's going to work. If anything, I'd expect that the miners who are currently signalling NYA would be more likely to switch to BCH than the miners who are planning to stick to BTC because they believe in it.

He says in the video that this only works against incorrectly configured websites, and I think it may also work against less popular websites that you haven't yet visited in a given browser. It doesn't break HTTPS connections, it just tries to trick you to open a fake HTTP version instead of the real HTTPS one, but it won't work if: 1) you've visited the site before and it correctly set a flag (HSTS) that tells your browser to always open it via HTTPS, or 2) it's included in a whitelist shipped with your browser which lists all popular sites that should always be opened only via HTTPS.
In any case, if you notice that the site is HTTP instead of HTTPS, you can just manually type HTTPS in the address bar and it will open the right version.
And in general, even if everything described there works, it's only as bad as if you connected to a non-encrypted WiFi, which people still commonly do anyway.

It wasn't stagnant in the first part, it crashed, from $1100 to below $200. And your chart makes that part look like a flat line, which means it's bullshit - it would have also looked like a flat line if it went back from $200 to $1100 back then. If you can barely see a movement 5-6x up or down on a chart, then it's useless. And the current crash, which looks soo scary on your chart, is actually just half of that crash. If you invested $1000 in winter 2014, you'd have $160 a year later, and if you invested $1000 in December 2017, you'd have $300+ now. Your chart doesn't show that.

What we have now is just a foundation, and there's so much more to be built on this foundation. For example assigning contacts/identity to addresses - how do I send BTC to someone if I just know their email address? How do I send someone a standardized request to pay me? How do I add someone to some kind of contacts list so that I can keep sending them transactions without asking them "hey, what's your address this time"? I think there is a quite real risk that the answers to such questions (and others) become "just do X, as long as they're on Coinbase/Circle, and if they're not then just invite them".

IMHO: because we got to the resistance line going down from 20k/mid December again, and possibly already through it. It's not clear if we've broken it, but since we might have, or if not, there's a good chance we will because the support at 6-7k was very strong, so people are FOMOing in now.

Hive is open source, but it had funding, so it really started as a startup that happened to be open source, not a typical hobbyist open source project.

It depends on what the Core team will do and whether some miners defect from the btc1 camp. I for one will be sticking to the core chain, and I suspect that a significant amount of people who own Bitcoin are running some version of Core, and might not be reading this subreddit at all, so they won't switch to some alternative client, because they don't even know it exists.
The plausible scenarios IMHO are:
- Core team agrees to do a 2x hard fork
- miners switch away from btc1, they lose momentum and the hard fork doesn't happen
- the hard fork happens with a majority of miners, but a lot of people stay on core and we get 2 Bitcoins for some shorter or longer period of time

Unlike some people here, I don't consider any web wallet of this kind evil by definition. They do have a role to play and I agree with you that they're much more likely to get the UX right and be more user-friendly and reach less technical people this way. I keep some of my bitcoins at Circle and I trust them to not go Gox, because I realize this is a much more serious and better managed company.
What I do find evil though is the kind of things we hear about Coinbase regularly every few weeks or so: blocking accounts, asking privacy-invading questions, tracking where the users' money goes several hops away from their address, and so on. Generally trying to be "more catholic than the Pope" in what the authorities might possibly expect from them. This is why I don't use Coinbase anymore, and I'll also stop using Circle if they start doing the same things too.
And another danger is that if everyone uses either Coinbase or Circle, we might start expecting that from everyone, and end up with proprietary standards and protocols that only work with these two. So we need to make sure that we have other wallets too that are actually popular, and that new protocols and standards are introduced as BIPs that can be implemented by anyone. As long as it doesn't matter which wallet you use, it shouldn't be a problem if most people use one of a couple web wallets.
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:49:25

The most surprising thing is that Circle is supposedly in the same category of services, but they're doing so much better job at this. I honestly don't remember any posts about them closing accounts for stupid reasons, tracking where people send their coins or requiring some crazy KYC procedures. Apparently it's not all because of regulations, because they should be following the same ones...
@_date: 2017-07-29 12:32:45
The reason why BIP148 was any threat to anyone was because if you gather enough companies, exchanges, wallets that run BIP148 and only accept Segwit-compatible blocks, it could convince miners to switch to that chain, because of fear of losing money not being able to use these services. It's not just about the fact of splitting a chain and about who has more nodes, but about having enough economical power that you can convince people to switch to your side because of the utility you provide.
But BCC creates a completely independent coin that (most likely) only a small minority of Bitcoin users will be interested in. And the number of people and companies that are interested in both Segwit and BCC used together is effectively zero. So it would be completely pointless to try to force a Segwit-supporting subchain of BCC, because even if you made one, no one would be interested in using one because you wouldn't provide any more utility over what standard BCC will provide.
And actually none of the above really matters, because IIRC, BCC actually removes support for Segwit, so if you tried to run a version of BCC enforcing or even supporting Segwit, it just wouldn't be compatible with BCC in any way and would be automatically rejected by BCC nodes.
@_date: 2015-02-19 13:39:12
Lighthouse crowdfundings work in such a way that when the project gets funded 100%, it creates one huge transaction collecting all the inputs together and connecting them to one output. You can only have some 600+ pledges before this transaction becomes so large (in terms of KB) that it takes half of the space in a whole blockchain block, which is the max size of a transaction. So the min pledge amount is the target amount divided by the max amount of pledges.

Breadwallet is honestly one of the better ones. There aren't many that are actually fully native iOS apps that look like whoever built them has any experience building native iOS apps.

Breadwallet is very minimalistic though, so maybe that's what you don't like about it (I guess it's meant to be easy for people who don't know much about Bitcoin). If that's the case, check out "bitWallet" (Sollico Software), it has a very classic UI and a lot of options.

The BCH people basically split into two camps, one around Roger/Jihan and the ABC devs, and one around CSW and his buddies. And both hate each other and believe the others are scammers (and ironically, both are right at that...).
The ABC team came up with some incompatible changes to the protocol they wanted to do in a hard fork, and the BSV team came up with a separate set of incompatible changes to the protocol, where each side strongly disagreed with the changes the other team wants to do. (I don't remember the details, stuff about some transaction ordering, enabling more opcodes, BSV also bumped up the block size a lot again.)
So they've split up into two coins, ABC appeared to be winning for a few days (they brought a lot of hashrate from BTC which mined at a loss), so they managed to claim the BCH ticker at all exchanges, but now BSV has more or less caught up with the hashrate and the price. A lot of people don't trust BSV because it's heavily centralized in the hands of CSW and his friends and CSW is basically not the most trustworthy person in the world, but at the same time BCH/ABC is now also more centralized than it was before, and during the fight they also introduced some "checkpoints" to forcefully prevent the blockchain from being reorganized, which a lot of people are really unhappy with.
I don't know what to expect at this point tbh, they made a huge mess and in the end it might ruin whatever chances BCH had. If I were to bet, I'd say BSV might pump a few times and then dump just as hard, and in the end it will settle somewhere below BCH price. The ABC team still has smarter and more reasonable people behind them IMHO (relatively speaking), so long term I think it has a better chance to build something (but still lower than before).

I'm not against the whole idea, as long as the vast majority of the community agrees and it doesn't result in a war between two Bitcoins for which is the One True Bitcoin. What I'm worried about though (apart from such chain war) is permanently switching to a different, probably technically inferior implementation and a different, less competent developer team. If they manage to do it in such way that the Core team gets on board, includes the changes in their client and most nodes can keep running the Core software, then I'm all for it. But if it's meant to be a takeover and we'll be stuck with a buggy client done by a less experienced team, then I think I'll pass.

This guy is a total weirdo and in a bad way. Everyone laughs at him, he's been trying to get into the Polish parliament for like 2 decades and always manages to get at most 4+%, but usually much less than that. His voter base is mostly young men and teenagers, and he's mostly known for wanting to destroy EU (which he mentions all the time), mentioning Hitler just as he's starting to raise in the polls, and making absurd and offensive statements (e.g. there was a lot of noise about him saying in the EP that women are less intelligent).

I don't know how exactly that will be shown, but definitely not in a crappy modal alert like there. Some kind of better looking window/panel perhaps. But the idea is to discourage reusing old addresses that were already used once, although you obviously should be able to see a list of them if you want to.
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:07:11
The PIN isn't actually required if you have the passphrase, the passphrase is sufficient to generate all the private keys from it. The PIN was used to unlock the passphrase stored on the device, but since you're logging in to a different app, you're setting up a new PIN, not logging in with the old one.

"To answer the question in the thread title...we're going all the way down.  There simply is no reason for bitcoins to be worth more than a $1, no reason at all.  Nagle has been right.  When a bubble pops, it pops all the way, and in the case of bitcoin, there's no reason for a legitimate recovery on the horizon."

Hive Mac dev here - you have two options:
1) Get the last version of Hive from  it should still work. Put the wallet in the right place (~/Library/Application Support/Hive/BitcoinJ.network/bitcoinkit.wallet) and start the app. If it works, you should see the main window, not the startup wizard. Then wait some time for it to sync (see the progress bar in the debugging tools window).
2) Try the last version of Multibit from the 1.x branch, IIRC it was able to open our wallet files.
A third, more hardcore option would be to find the command line wallet management tool that was distributed with bitcoinj, not sure if it still is, and try to extract the private key using it :)
The FAQ might help you too: 
EDIT: I meant latest Multibit Classic (that would be 0.5.19), as opposed to Multibit HD which uses BIP32 passphrases.

How does that work though, in practice, what is the process? I mean, here in Poland you can e.g. go to the operator's office and ask them to switch from a full-size to a nano SIM, in which case (after checking your ID card) they give you a new different SIM. Or you can request your number to be transferred to a new operator when signing a new contract, in which case they contact the old operator, which takes probably a day, and give you a new SIM.
But in each case, you have to actually physically go somewhere and be handed a new SIM card. How do you do it online? You put a random SIM card into your phone, you call operator X and you tell them "yo, John Smith here, please transfer the number 123-456-789 to SIM card with ID 987654321"?...
Is this about Verizon using CDMA instead of GSM, does that work differently in those networks?

If you really need 100% reliable anonymity, as in "they will kill me if they find me", that's actually very hard to achieve... You'd also need to be very careful about what address in what wallet you receive the coins on, and where and how you transfer it further. If you're not, at some point later the transaction can be matched to you through some other coins you mix in from another address, or through an exchange account, etc.

Since when are Bitcoin transactions made by logging in to someone else's wallet? Who the hell does that? If someone tells you to log in to their wallet instead of sending the money, something is very wrong already.
In online transactions, you don't send someone the goods when they tell you they have money, you send them the goods when you receive money from them... if they won't or can't send the money, no deal. What's so difficult about it?

It should be handled in exactly the same way as in case of fiat money. You don't pay taxes based on what is on your bank account, you pay taxes based on what you report that you have earned. If you earn money in bitcoins or by trading bitcoins, you should report your profit same way as when you earn money in green papers with some guy's face on them. The fact that it's hard to track bitcoins doesn't change that - cash is also hard to track, but honest people still report what they earn in cash, because they don't want their country to go bankrupt, or because they're afraid the tax agency will ask one day how they were able to afford a house.

Ok, fair enough. A lot of things in EU are ridiculously overregulated indeed...
That said, there really is a difference between inspecting bridges and regulating who can invest in Bitcoin. I don't have a problem with safety regulations for buildings and bridges etc., because not doing that would be a direct risk to people's lives, and no one's going to manually check every bridge they want to drive through.
On the other hand, in case of things like Bitcoin, it's really your own choice if you want to risk more than you should or not. If we want to prevent people from harming themselves this way with regulation, then we should probably also limit how much fast food people are allowed to eat monthly, how many beers you're allowed to drink during one night and so on...

Java is only required because of the bitcoinj library we use to manage the wallet, the UI is pure Cocoa. Believe me, we'd love to get rid of it, and maybe one day we will, but that was simply the best bitcoin library available at the moment.
An intermediate step would be to provide a micro-JVM like avian embedded inside the app bundle, so that people doesn't have to install Java in the system (or even know it's being used). We've actually tried that, but connecting together bitcoinj, avian and Cocoa turned out to be a huge challenge. That's still on our list though, hopefully we'll find a solution later.

I don't understand this - can someone explain to me how you can send bitcoins to a wrong address by accident? And what's a "sending address" and "receiving address"?
