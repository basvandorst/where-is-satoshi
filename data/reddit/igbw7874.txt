Just wait for the coming Carbon footprint taxes. That will happen at some point.

I'll go with my favorite, Nano, no fees, faster than this (fully confirmed) and the lowest carbon footprint(to my knowledge of any cryto). I'm a fanboy but none of previous statement are untrue.
\*enqueued - My brain and typing speeds are out of sync. Thanks for pointing out my bad grammar. 
\*overtoke - I own Bitcoin as well I made to mention that it would be a smart move to sell right now.
\*My point was only there's a much more efficient Coin for storing an sending value. Just wait for the Carbon taxes are put in place by countries. At that point I'm not sure that Bitcoin will be profitable to mine.  Already Washington State is enacting [Bitcoin mining taxes](
Also, I see the excitement and 3rd party Development on r/nano that I used to see on r/Bitcoin even after it bottomed at $230 that one time. The first time someone sent me RaiBlocks(now Nano) I was blown away. Now that it's becoming more and more decentralized as full nodes come on line it's exciting. If I'm wrong so be it but I can buy a lot of Nano and only whiff of a the cost of a Bitcoin on my limited budget.

Oh we'll pay as the cost will trickle down to the consumer. Which I'm fine with I'd like to have a planet worth retiring to when I retire.

It's doubtful that the taxation rate wouldn't be progressive. I'm guessing it would start at trucking company level or large cattle farms but would be based on ppm each company generates or uses off the grid.
