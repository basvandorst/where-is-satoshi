So, you decided to become the scammer.
"You've done something illegal to others, let me do the same to you!".
Do you live by an eye for an eye?

Alright, so I'm in this situation aswell.
First time I've traded bitcoin (I'm doing it through Bitcoin Core and I've tried the solutions I can find here on reddit and elsewhere..)
My transaction has been pending since 8th of May..
I thought Bitcoin Core would set the fee pretty high (high enough atleast) when you do recommended fee (with fast option selected aswell)
But I guess it didn't, since it only gave 20 sat/B..
Is there anything I can do to speed up the transaction or cancel it?
I've tried to abandon it and Bitcoin Core doesn't allow me it..
Forgot to add my transaction link:

So, you turned into a scammer, to scam the scammers.

Everytime I try the txaccelerator it just says it has reached it limit, tried it multiple times before, I dunno what to do :_|
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:08:21
Well fuck, I just don't understand how the other transaction went through pretty quick and mine didn't, even though it's in the same transaction? Thought it was a block that was mined, and they both were in it...
Anyway, I didn't set the fee, the bookmaker did and I thought it would be enough :|
