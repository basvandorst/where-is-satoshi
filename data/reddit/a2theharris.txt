Good luck I hope they don't rip you off. I hate hearing about victims of fraud especially when it involves bitcoin mining. Seems like that's one of the biggest threats in mass adoption when prices fluctuate so much.

Doesn't matter. Citizens united decision means an unlimited amount of money can come from foreign sources provided the business receiving the laundered money is American.

Was it paid for through bitcoin speculation profits or simply paid by using bitcoin?

Most scams require the less sophisticated buyers to be given some seemingly independent signifier that they are making a good investment. The classic penny stock scam is probably what this guy is trying to pull. Refer the target, in this case potential first time bitcoin buyers, to a chart that shows trade volume doesn't match the price so get in now while there's a gap between volume and price.

He's no hero. This meme has to be a joke. Even if you throw away the contract killing messages because of possible evidence tampering where there was an unparalleled amount of government graft, then he still created a site that profited from child porn even though it was supposedly not allowed.

The about just-dice.com section gives away the source...as itself with all their glowing adjectives. Also, some one losing their ass initially is not being "bullish". They're being victimized. This is hailcorporate worthy.
