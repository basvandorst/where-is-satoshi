Lol, no. I think he's saying that people think if the world is "run" by Bitcoin, the world will burn...then the scene pans out and we realize it's not burning...the only thing that changed is the fact that he was able to buy that painting/photo with Bitcoin. Or at least that's how I read it.

"this is a significant flaw in the currency for OP's mother however, since it is about twelve orders of magnitude too large for the amount she usually charges for a suck and fuck down at the docks." - Said by someone whose mother didn't teach him how to play nice.

You sir have far too much time on your hands. Why don't you get a job and maybe a lover? Oh wait, that's right...you can't. You've proven yourself to be unloveable. Go away.

Can you please marry me? Assuming you're a heterosexual male that is, not that I have anything against any other type of male...I just would prefer you to be a heterosexual male...that is if you would marry me. Ok, this is getting out of hand. tl;dr Comic funny, marry me?

Dude, he just started like a few weeks ago. Chill. Let him do his thing. I don't think he needs a comedy partner.

Ah....everyone touches everyone's peni (that's the plural of penis...right? haha) because no man/boy washes his hands in the bathroom...and then proceeds to tip his stripper with dollah, dollah billz...right? Then that stripper does copious amounts of crack cocaine on those dollah, dollah billz because....why the heck not? I think I understand this one....

I've lived near the D for a bit, this is an accurate portrayal.

You're just jealous, haha. And well I guess if he's shitting out comics, he shits some pretty good stuff. They may not be gold, but it's some good shit.
