Not sure if this is accurate but I think the IV overstatement is to promote market makers selling options. I presume this would carry into selling bitcoin futures (no crypto options in US from what I’ve seen) but I don’t know how to confirm this easily.

Just like they did with phone infrastructure. 
Skipped home phone lines and went straight to mobile via satellite.

What if it said “don’t buy bitcoin”
@_date: 2019-10-08 21:59:34
Gonna be waaaay worse for USD
E: Therefore, this is good for bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-08 21:05:42
 \&gt; name something that would be bad for bitcoin, just try me

Who cares about being rich when you could rule the world?
@_date: 2019-12-24 06:14:23
If you crack sha256 you don’t use that power to steal bitcoin (because then everyone knows bitcoin is no longer safe). 
You use it to spy on foreign military communications and the like. You don’t show the whole world what you can do, you keep it a secret.

Yeah, he goes into way more detail on this in one of his talks.

Bargaining doesn’t fit among the others. 
This is just acceptance.
@_date: 2019-12-25 04:55:22
No amount of money can buy power over a foreign nation quite like being able to hear everything they say in private.
And yes, I do believe SHA256 is the standard. If there were anything better, bitcoin would use that by now.

Uhh did you add a number or did it actually 100x in 2 hours?
@_date: 2019-09-21 21:06:36
I’d love to do this, I live in a major metro area and tons of people would see an atm near me. Please shoot me more info!
@_date: 2019-09-10 02:45:19
Bc it’s centralized
@_date: 2019-09-25 00:07:41
This doesn’t seem right...
- May 28 (open 8,785 - close 8,738) =&gt; -0.5%
- June 25 (open 11,025 - close 11,768) =&gt; +6.73%
Even given that you said “on average” and even looking at the intraday highs/lows (not open/close) I don’t see how this could be correct. 
More sauce pls.
