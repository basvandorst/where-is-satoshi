I dont get the American economy is soaring. The stock market is at a all time highs and people are complaining? This would have never happened under Clinton.

My tinfoil hat theory is Roger Ver and his gang are working with CME Futures and bankers. If the stock market keeps the price of BTC stable we are in trouble. 
Roger Ver and his group own 300 - 500 thousand BTC. If coinbase is involved with Rogers evil plan Ver is in control of 500,000+ BTC to manipulate prices. When CME needs BTC they buy direct from Roger at a set price. Hurts BTC while Ver pumps his Btrash. Would anyone put this past Roger Ver, the stock market guys or bankers?
BTC has been flat lining about a week after CME pumped BTC to 20k. If the stock market and bankers didn't get involved in BTC would it be flat lining today? A lot of new people and money coming into the crypto market since Dec 10th. 
Again this is only a theory. What's not a theory is Roger Ver is a greedy and evil man. Roger has gone out of his way to hurt BTC and people that  BTC for self gains.

The ones benefiting under Obama's Economy were curropt government officials. New jobs are coming back to America and the stock market is breaking records because of Donald Trump 
Google obamagate. There will be charges of treason to officials in the Obama administration. Comey, Andrew McCabe and possibly the Clintons. The next few weeks should be interesting.
It started��

Thanks for the heads up. Knowing its a small island and Roger Ver might even visit St Kitts makes It a no go zone for me. Roger Ver is Btrash.

Selling Bitcoin and crypto from a Trezor. 
New to crypto. Bought a Trezor as suggested by the experienced people on. Where can I cash in bitcoin or litecoin from the trezor without paying coin base fees?

Ask Roger Ver on Twitter how its done. He denounced his American citizenship. Pretty sure he lives in Japan now.

Rogers actions the past 3 weeks in the business world would be called a tried "hostile takeover". Roger spent 150 million pumping Bcash. He raised the 150 million by selling 25,000 of his bitcoin destabilizing the crypto market. 
Roger was a huge bitcoin advocate and promoter the last 6 years. He felt like he deserved to be on charge of bitcoin. 
Bcash is a corporate. Bitcoin is decentralized. Bcash will be successful but nothing like BTC. 
My prediction is litecoin will outperform Bcash in 2018 by a large margin and Bitcoin will reach $30,000 before Bcash reaches $3000.
Side note. Roger did invest in Ethereum with some of that 150 million.

Not sure if hes a Japanese citizen or not. In a few you-tube videos he stated he lived in Japan.
He recently stated he spent 10 months in a prison but he didn't say why he was locked up.

Congrats on your first bitcoin buy. If your going to buy crypto every week look into ethereum &amp; litecoin, both are sold at coin base. This past week ETH out preformed bitcoin by a wide margin.
