At $10k (and assuming you owned 'only' 1MM bitcoins) you would still need another $20k per bitcoin to be the 22nd richest person in the world.

Love hearing from long term bitcoiners who were at the for front before it was even a niche. 
Thanks for posting OP. I wish I had been present through those years.

Similar to an older project Kryptoradio in Finland a few years ago. Great ideas and agree that there is needed as many mechanisms as possible to communicate with the blockchain.

If you own the private key you own the coin.

I do this all the time. Bread will pick up non confirmed transactions also so you can see it confirming through the app. I have been with bread since day 1 and have never had an issue. 
I would though make sure the app is the correct one as there are some copycats. On iOS it is in version 2.0 updated a few days ago with a redesign.

Got my first bits in 2027. Come back to get some at a discount. Difficult to get out the Citadel nowadays but snuck through.

Ken Sherriff's blog (righto.com) has lots of great info. Here is a starter for you - mining bitcoin by hand !

Well done Godfreee. I have been following you guys for several years now and it is really great to see your success.

Great service. Never had any issues. I would recommend them.

As the walls fell. 
Unfortunately you have to find this yourself. Then the epiphany will come and you will see like the OP. I remember when I just suddenly 'got it'. Still cannot explain it though - but just inherently get it.

A few years ago now but mine was a memory card from scan.co.uk. Cannot remember the cost exactly but it was about 0.05 btc.

My story:
Note. Timeline below is not 100% accurate but gives the gist. 
2013: 
Significant debt (&gt;2 yr salary not including mortgage), had no choices, no savings, no pension. Struggling with mortgage (which was interest only). No one who knew me would have even guessed. I had a nice house with loads of useless stuff that I was beginning to hate. 
Mid 2013: 
Found out about bitcoin mid 2013 but could not afford to participate. This triggered something in me. Something needed to change. I created a spreadsheet and looked at the full mess I was in for the first time. Shit. 
Late 2013: 
I had learned as much as I could about bitcoin and my past approach on money had now dramatically changed. Purchased a very small amount on bitcoin late 2013. 
2014: 
No motivation just discipline. Each item of debt on the spreadsheet was now systematically being tackled or reduced by any means I could. Fines and late payment fees that previously drained my last pennies could now being used to pay back further debt. 
Mid 2014: 
Slow but steady growth of my collection of bitcoin. Every row that was deleted from my spreadsheet of debt I allowed myself to buy a little more btc to add to the collection. 
Late 2014: 
Started a pension with money that become free from more debt being cleared. This was the beginning of a new relationship with money. Things were starting to change. My future self was starting to thank me. 
Early 2015:
All useless debt (non needed mobile phone contracts, extra cable/internet etc) that I had built up were now gone. Now time to tackle the 'consolidation loans' from early 2008-2010. My tally of btc was growing. They were my small rewards. 
Mid 2015:
By this time the money I had free from reducing my debt was now used on overpaying my loans. I was setting up a position to clear all debt by early 2016. Credit cards were now all paid off and closed. Purchased a little more btc - made sure I rewarded my small wins. It was the only thing that kept me sane. 
Jan 2016:
All debt now paid off. All that was left was my overdrafts. I had been living in these for 2 decades. 
April 2016: 
Overdrafts all paid off. I think I ate porridge for 2 months to do this !
May 2016: 
Put my house up for sale. I didn't need the space and it just reminded me what an idiot I had been. I was a fool for buying this and buying into the hype (mid 2006). 
June 2016: 
Sold my house. Made a little on it which was great. This was the first sign of being fully debt free since 1998. 
August 2016: 
Moved out to cheaper rental property. Bitcoin collection was now healthy. I actually had some spare money after savings for additional rainy days savings. Pension was now being maximised. 
Oct 2016:
Went on vacation for first time in 11 years. Got married to my childhood sweetheart. 
Dec 2016:
Rainy day fund (full contingency) was now saved. Took a lot of energy not to put this in bitcoin !
Feb 2017: 
House deposit finally saved using some bitcoin and some monthly savings. Put this in separate pot. 
April 2017:
Bought a property that I love and I move in in June. Plan to overpay the mortgage from the start and have built a full savings pot with rainy day funds. The collection of btc still growing strong and acts as a reminder of how far I had come. 
Today: 
I have zero debt. I have options. I now only spend what I don't first save. I have more than enough contingency for all bills and a healthy pension pot, healthy savings and healthy btc position. 
I am still not finished. There is more I can do. I lost 20 years to debt and because of that I missed lots of opportunities. I was very angry at that. I was mostly angry because it was my fault. I was such a fool. It took a long time to let that go but took much longer to see it. 
Now I save for the future, DCA a little bitcoin for long term holdings and laugh a lot with my wife. We will be having our first child next year. 
TL,DR: Bitcoin completely changed my life for the better. I owe a lot to bitcoin. I will always be grateful for what it has given me. 
Thanks for asking the question OP.

Really great to hear ! I have done almost exactly the same thing but in the UK. A bit less convoluted as I got away with just saying I was a rare coin collector !

Long time full node member checking in with an Sapphire Edge ! In the U.K. and cost me £99. Looks smart and is solely used as my core full node.

bitWallet works well for me.

I am currently going through this (In UK). My aim was to get the cash into a new bank/savings account as early as possible and not touch it. I am just about to exchange contracts (delayed several times) and sold some BTC early April and missed the price rise.  
I still have my cold storage but that bit still gets to me... all 2014/15/16 and miss it by a few weeks ! I have and had been holding for several years and DCA all the way. However it was take the chance and sell or wait and possibly risk having issues. I sold. 
The irony is that a previous purchase fell through (last year) and for that I needed proof of deposit so transferred a qty of BTC via Circle and had the deposit mode in £ sterling and a 5 min transfer later cost me 3 BTC in exchange rate fees. Funnily enough no current request this time round so I constantly think what if I had just waited ....
Good luck though buddy. For me it was worth it knowing that I have all my finances in order if ever needed or requested. Should hopefully only be a few more weeks !

I'm right with you. I use to use takeaway.com (In the UK) and I would spend around 0.1 btc per meal. I had many meals with them over the period of around 2 years. I don't think they operate in the U.K. anymore. Happy to say I always bought straight back in with a little extra for luck ;)
