There was an interesting interaction below, couldn't grab that. Maybe it wasn't John. Anyhow sanity is overrated.

At this point I just hope he's right, whatever the coin prevents him from cannibalizing him self on TV.

Don't forget that Satoshi (person or group) hold a lot of BTC that hasn't been moved. Without revealing their identity just shapeshifting all that BTC to other coin will be enough.

Gone, you sold to low and lost half your money. I recommend to avoid doing any further transactions until you figure out how it works, that waiting time might get your money back.

If you have more than enough money buy now. It might go down in the future but it will certainly bounce back and reach new high values.
In addition if you buy a large quantity you will contribute to the valuation in price.

Sure, it should be safe. My advice, using an offline box generate some Bitcoin addresses and encrypt them using your PGP key. If key and password are not compromised you should be safe.
In fact you could even publish the encrypted zip in a public FTP. That's how cryptography works, it is how the blockchain works.
There shouldn't be a risk with Gmail other than data loss. But you could have copies.
Now, if you lose your PGP key or the password is compromised, then you are screwed.

Don't take my word. But last time I did the math under the same assumption (free electricity) it was more profitable to invest in BTC instead. Let's say your willing to invest 10k in the Asics it will take some time to get your investment back. ETH and BTC have grow a lot in just a few months.

This seems a good candidate, although at the bottom of their FAQ reads:
"The Token sale is not intended for persons who are citizens of or residents or domiciled in the United States of America and/or entities incorporated, established or registered in or under the laws of the United States of America"

Con you confirm if OP pm's you and issue is real?

Have you read "Human Action" by von Mises? I like to think that Bitcoin was born in a Libertarian circle, a group of people with solid knowledge of mathematics, computer science, economics and human behavior.
As you may know, South America is the classic example of corruption, highly inefficient public institutions, aggressive tax pressure and double standards. Most of the people is good in nature and hard working but are subject to abuse by groups with too much power. The rest of the world is not that different.
Cryptocurrencies aim for decentralized consensus among un-trusted parties. How can someone with BTC/LTC can reliable transfer value without a central institution is something extraordinary. And the blockchain itself is extraordinary.
Sometimes power is disguised as a need to have control for our own good. Money laundering is used as an example of the need to regulate blockchains. But no matter what we do, money laundering will still exist. People will figure out ways to do it. On the other side, blockchain can have a huge impact on economies at all scales.
My advice would be to first get involved, understand what is it, own it, read a lot, if possible start your own business and put Bitcoin to practice. Those will be your credentials when you go talk to people.
We are in a very early stage, still a POC that will open a few roads for the future.

No clue about legal scope, but for your question, Mayweather is under global watch now.

Encrypt your private keys using a symmetric algorithm (passphrase), convert to ASCII (armor) and print them using an dot-matrix printer. Buy a ticket your town - Shanghai - La Paz - Lisbon - your town (or nearest).
In addition buy two Samsonite carry-ons (exact same model different colors).
You'll need three days in Shanghai. Book The PuLi. Ask for Li Jun at the bar. Order the SegWit special martini. /s

1) Satoshi hasn't move his coins yet, so it's early to conclude that. 2) Greed is an important factor, without it wouldn't​ work. A disciple of Von Mises could have created BTC. Someone with deep understanding of what drives human action and economy.
What I agree is that greed, even though is needed it's controlled by the network. 10 years from now cryptocurrencies will be part of our daily life, but BTC et. al. might be gone by then.

Free market trading. There are open buy/sell orders. Their intersection is the reference price. Price is driven by supply and demand.
