I did not say or imply any of the following things:
















 
Note that aside from these quotes above, the remainder of your reply is basically either insults and a couple of inaccurate statements. To which I have the following responses:


Sadly you are wrong here; the state and industry strongly steer impactful technological advancement, and, then wield those matured technologies. I wish science had more independence, I really do, but sadly it has historically, and still is essentially, a means to an ends that the heads of state control. This actually sheds light on another large counterpoint against Anarchy; if the governments just dissolve, a grass-roots movement of local neighbours gaining power would not likely be the case - the people with the resources, i.e. fuel/energy, food, clean water, building materials/machines, communication infrastructure, *weapons*, and the like would gain the power and negotiate/compete for territorial dominance, most likely with violence. Yes maybe some financiers would be dethroned, but the world operates on a very large number of commodities, and the people who control those would just step up. This wouldn't be the rise of the have-nots over the haves. No, this would just the be rise of certain Haves over the rest. But once again, this would just be a snapshot, a transient point in our re-evolution to eventually having a new government oversee the industries.


The human condition I am referring to is not the result of any environment, it is the flaws and weaknesses any human in any environment on this earth is prone to to some degree or another. I'll spell out just some of them for you: ego, bias, limited perception/information, limited energy/patience/discipline/learning capacity, fear of survival and the need for sustenance, and so on. 
And to the medley of insults: look at our situation right now, two people are having a completely anonymous, inconsequential discussion with no dramatic life threatening factors associated to it, and yet tempers are still rising and insults are being thrown around. Don't you think if we were face to face and any one of the countless day-to-day challenges to our survival we would face in an anarchy were the topic at hand, that we wouldn't end up trying to use "coercive force" eventually? It only takes one act of aggression for it to start and once it starts it is very hard to go back, as SouporBonBon has detailed. And be sure that philosophical idealists wouldn't be immune to it (if at the very least their bodies are still in the real world).
I'm not sure if you are bored, don't understand, or are just blinded by rage for the current system, but in any case you seem to just want to preach and vent on the topic to me, instead of trying to understand my points and have a coherent discussion. You basically read a vague/blanketing point (purposefully so, due to the previously mentioned complexity of the topic and the context of this conversation), then you find a very illogical and controversial interpretation (a low hanging, *imaginary* fruit), and then get worked up and preach to me about it, all while creating enough errors and contradiction that comprehensively addressing it would be a very large waste of time (even more so than this comment). 
I am not an expert on these topics, but simple common sense and functionally comprehensive imagination of such scenarios are what we are working here. I am not attacking you, and I am not condoning exploitation of peoples and unfair power structures. Is that clear enough for you?
I'm not going to indulge you in this long and pointless pissing match; if you have relevant rebuttals, or legitimate &amp; constructive questions please let me know, otherwise, good day to you sir/madam.

Great post, I think it paints a convincing picture of human behaviour/flaws and a likely potential timeline. There are a few things I'd like to add to you point, but I'm in a rush, so I'll just say this:
**Government as we know it is a very advanced and elaborate thing, and it took a lot to get here**. It has gotten where it is now over millenia, from people dedicating their lives in many different capacities to it -constantly addressing specific, practical imperfections/deficiencies in policies. Don't let some petty banksters or politicians devalue or oversimplify your perception of it. If we simply "started over", we would have to go through the very long and costly growing pains it would take to get back to were we are today (violence, rape, illness, famine, religious/gender/sexual/geographic/etc discrimination, psychologically traumatizing situations and a million other "misfortunes" the majority of the people in this thread, including myself, can't even think of because we are lucky enough to have our lives have been omitted from such devolved *anarchy*). In the context above it would go something like this: first day we stand up to the man and reject our current system, next week we party like Avril Lavigne, next six *horrific* months are spent warring and expanding groups, and then we would spend the next **few decades** trying to get back to the same level of quality of life we have now. And then after that, we will realize that the new group in power still isn't perfect, they are still humans and have limited time/perception/energy/influence. They will still fall victim to special interest groups, misconceptions/misinformation, personal motivations, and of course the fact they are temporary and needy beings not some god-like mountain of omnipresent justice that doesn't need anything and has no weakness! The intentions of the systems are good, they usually are, but the problem arises when humans (note the plural, one "Gandhi" cannot do it all) try to operate on an *ideal, all knowing* level, for any significant period of time. This notion that Rome can be rebuilt in a day only sheds light at how taken for granted the current system is, and how unfamiliar some are with *natural* and unregulated nature of humans.
**TL;DR**: The "system" has been developing for millennia and in many cases is better than ever, don't mistake human flaws for systematic ones, or else you will become tragically familiar with (the timeless) human flaws, in the absence the "system".

Yea that's a pretty concise way of putting it, but *perfectly* is an extreme word...
I would change **boss** to **bosses**, because the chances of getting a awesome boss are low (say 1%) but still attainable. But when you start having several bosses, like a large and distributed government would have, the chances of the entire management department being awesome drops exponentially; even as little as say 3 bosses brings us down to a virtually unachievable possibility (0.01 * 0.01 * 0.01=0.000001 ie. 1 in a million).
But even that won't do *perfectly* because the government isn't your boss, and this isn't a business context... If I had to say it that concisely, I'd say:
"Meet these humans, yep they are just human".

I will try and answer below, but keep in mind this is a very complex and long topic, which we are just spit-balling on reddit about, so an overscrupulous &amp; pedantic disposition is counter productive in this context. 


No, I am saying is the system is not fine. But merely saying that is a pretty superficial, and inconsequential statement. What I am saying is the *cause* of this not-fine-ness is the human condition. The general intentions are good and right (taxation, police, healthcare, education, etc.), but in the process of actually making systems to do these things (making the policies, working out the numbers, operating these organizations) is where the problems arise. And these arise not because of some conspiracy or coincidental one time event that created this concrete, un-retractable screw up, no, they arise because of fundamental flaws in the beings that create and operate such systems. It will happen every single time such a system is created, to some degree or another, eventually. 


Yup, go ahead, be my guest. Congrats, you've come full circle to the original thinking behind this thread.


Rhetorical? Once again, I don't know, you can go ahead and aim for the noble prize on that one too.


No it's not, but ideals can never be achieved... by definition! There is certainly a lot of room for improvement in our systems, I agree, but there has already been tons and tons of improvement and added considerations compared to where we were 100 or 1000 years ago. The shear amount of laws and policies that need to exist in our modern society is much much more than it used to be (and for good reason, globalization and technology create staggering amounts of things that need to be regulated). And that amount of policy is just too much for numerous small decentralized organizations to take on. It's just not realistic. 10-1000 people can't do the work of 100,000-10,000,000.


I agree, but my point is it is just devolution, essentially. anarchism = temper-tantrum. It will just lead us to more primitive, cruder form of government which will inevitably grow and grow and lead to a more centralized and similar government to what we have now - as Monsieur SouporBonBon describes above. That's the main point being made here. After countless generations we have a united, productive GLOBAL society; where millions of people work together through systems that were built by their elders, and we are seeing progress and evolution on unprecedented scales! Certainly there are still many problems and very large groups of people who are suffering and victims of this system, and we do need to make these issues a priority... but they are natural and likely challenges that would come up time and time again, regardless of how many revolutions we have. We are at the limits of humans, and anarchism's solution is to just restart the game, so we don't have these problems any more... but it's short-sighted and pointless, we will have much larger problems then, and eventually we will just find ourselves at the same mess we started with, facing those very same fundamental human limitations!
