Try looking at [Romit]( for payment services or you could try [BitScan]( you can set up a store and sell directly with them, they will handle the payments for you.

Right now, I'm wondering how best to clean my system...
@_date: 2014-02-12 11:06:34
Fair one. Shit title. Our bad. Did the article itself take you anywhere interesting tho?
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:21:44
Fair point. We're working on an Android app at the moment...

Damnit, that's a good point.  I passed the transaction file to Armory but have wiped it from my flash drive. I'll re-pose the question and post the second address here when they respond.
No offence taken re your first comment, but as a business we're real sensitive to spamming reddit. Having said this, we did just launch our directory App on Google Play (&amp; re-launch the iOS version) ;-)

Mate, that is NOT why I posted.

Fair points. Building this resource has been hard graft and it's free. If that's not good enough for you we can't help.

I think there's huge potential value in what you are doing - particularly for merchants that trade or could trade online. If you're interested in establishing your own agency check out

BitScan pays and we have no agenda. No shit.

Not sure if this is the done thing on Reddit but I've reflected on what you've said here and would like to engage further. If you're prepared to get in touch I'm pretty easy to find. I'd be grateful for the opportunity to better understand your position. RW.

The aim of the L+B project is to incentivize people to provide exactly the education you want at the grass roots.
@_date: 2015-04-22 12:14:58
Thanks for the heads-up. We'll get onto that!
@_date: 2013-12-29 08:26:58
Hmmm, we'll review server mgmt/data warehousing. Thanks again.
@_date: 2013-07-12 06:55:41
Ah, okay. Will try that now.
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:19:50
Thanks for that. Will implement. How was the upload/update speed? Did anything crash on you? Also, was is sufficiently intuitive?

Hi. Some will be aware that we have been posting bitcoin market analysis and features for some time. We have also been building a website and iOS app that helps consumers and bitcoin businesses connect, which launched in beta just before Xmas. The business database contains over 4,000 businesses and is supplemented by a classifieds marketplace that enables merchants and private vendors to showcase products for sale. As we seek to optimize the site and app (Andoid in the hoist) we'd really appreciate community feedback on what you like and don't like about what we are attempting to do.
