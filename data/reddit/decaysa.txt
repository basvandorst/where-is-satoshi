The difference is built in fees charged by the cell networks. With MPESA you have agents competing with their fees on top of the network fees. 
I do expect higher fees for Abra in areas where holding cash is risky,than in less risky areas.
Competition can drive them much lower though because Abra is charging so much less.
In addition Abra is global so the use cases are much wider and stronger.
My core point was though that most tellers will be people/businesses that already work with money. Not random people walking around.

Every ATM on the planet already have this problem. Everyone knows you have cash as you walk away from it. So why do we have them ??

Crime exists. People will take your valuables and kill you for them. This does not preclude business going forward or having valuables...
Shops already get robbed etc. still they remain open. That's life.

MPESA has already proven that this works. MPESA has all the same risks with massive fees and its hugely successful. 
You absolutely should not become a teller If you're not geared to dealing with the risks of having cash on hand. But corner side cafes and supermarkets already deal with these risks. This is an opportunity for them to make extra money.

What stops any shop that already has teller machines etc. and fixed rent from putting up a little 'ABRA TELLER SERVICES' sign and making extra money ?

Should this not be true for EVERYTHING you buy ?????
I buy a car so I can get to work and earn money.
I buy food so I can stay alive and earn money.
I buy a TV so I can relax and not go postal tomorrow at work so I can earn money.
I've never felt like I had to buy something just to get rid of my horrible fiat...

Your'e buying power after 10 years of holding onto a property will be completely dependant on the relative value of your house to other assets. The currencies involved in buying and selling the house is irrelevant.
The fact that there might have been better investment opportunities... Like holding on to bitcoin or buying google stock could obviously influence your decision.. But it should do that already. I really fail to grasp any of these deflationary currency worries.
