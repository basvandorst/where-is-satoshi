Apparently the Spaniards do, hence the link to. RT News (es) even reported on it:

OK.

No. Anyone, anywhere (in Japan), can adversely possess(squat on and use) privately owned land at any time. It is the right and obligatory duty of the legal owner to prove that they are in fact the legal owner of said land, and voice their opposition to the adverse possessor. If the adverse possessor physically stays on or uses the land for a specified amount of time (20 years in Japan) without intervention, then legal ownership for the adverse possessor can be gained via the court.

I've googled the heck out of this micronation in Japanese and have found nothing written about it. No court case, no articles, nothing. So you're probably right about it not being recognized, but that's what makes it a micronation.

[OP]( here. From [The Patch's official website faq]( : "*Yoshida laid visible claim to the land – abandoned land – for 20 years without intervention. At parts of the abandoned land he staked The Patch’s flag (whereon it was written that he claimed all abandoned lands within X amount of square kilometers) and, at other parts of abandoned land, he collected firewood and mushrooms, dug swells, planted fruit trees, and grew vegetables, wild rice and herbs. In other words, he practiced good stewardship of the land that he claimed to be his; maintained an intense relationship with it.*"

My link to Kamakura Shogunate was on topic, imho. :)
I think this is a semantics issue. "Burden of proof" makes it sound like the adverse possessor is burdened by having to prove himself; prove that he is worthy, but in reality the way it works (in Japan) is that the adverse possessor physically does something on the land (tree planting, cultivation, et al) while saying "*I'm taking this, will you stop me?*" The act in and of itself proves that he is worthy. 
You don't have to write a 20 page document outlining what you plan to do on the land, you just do what you do until either somebody says "stop", or 20 years pass without fight. 


It'll only work in the countryside where depopulation is ripe and abandoned lands abound, but watch out you just might get The Patch as your neighbor !

I understand this, but please remember that Yoshida laid claim to abandoned land ! What that means, I think, is that if the abandon-ers had protested Yoshida's claim, they would have liabled themselves for back-taxes. I presume Yoshida knew this and used it to his advantage.

Update: [Hideyuki Yoshida, founder of Woodland Patchwork did an AMA]( That link goes to it.

Hmm... To me it sounds like the guy isn't looking for recognition at all, at least not from Japan, and that he's content with micronational status, legit or not.  
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:14:41
Sounds legit to me [non sarc]. The remainder of the three sentence answer is as follows:
"*Also, under Japanese law Yoshida did have actual, legal ownership of the abandoned lands. Then he took those lands and founded a micronation, rendering them Japan’s no more.*"

[OP]( here. 2.5 million acres = [Nagano prefecture]( That's a sizable chunk of old Japanese territory.

I AM sure. I will try and explain why but will totally understand if my explanation sounds unreasonable to you. Actually, it will sound unreasonable to most who are not Japanese. Japanese acquisitive prescription is in two instances (there are three varieties of the law) the exact opposite of the West's adverse possession, which, like you say, means the adverse possessor has the burden of proof. 
* 1. Unregistered type {[Tomoyuki Toshinori method](
* 2. Abandoned Private Land type
* 3. Border Dispute type
For 1. and 2. the party making the claim as adverse possessor does not have the burden of proof. They are physically saying "*I'm taking this, will you stop me*?" For 3. the party making the claim as adverse possessor does have the burden of proof. They are saying "*I think the property line is different, here is my proof*." 
Japanese acquisitive prescription goes back to the [Kamakura Shogunate (1192–1333)] ( when the law was utilized by strongmen to expand their domains (they weren't exactly marauders). Over time acquisitive prescription on the archipelago fizzled, Japan became at one point regressive imperialistic giants (we know the end to that story), then progressive at home while importing all the resources they need: oil, timber et al.   
Now, back to Yoshida. The land he laid claim to was ALL abandoned land (private - see 2.), which meant that nobody was paying property taxes to the Japanese government, and also nobody was intervening or protesting his claim. He physically said, "*I'm taking this, will you stop me*?", and nobody said nothing, zilch.
