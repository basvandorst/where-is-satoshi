Thank you! Im on holiday in spain and phoned my mum. She told me barclays were going to start some kind of bitcoin integration.   
I said she must have been mistaken! 
5 min to find the paywall and another 30 min to find this!  
Thanks again.

DyslexicZombei suggested the same and as you anticipated its dampened the sound. Now it just sounds like a giant fan! And I couldn't really justify underclocking it i just wanted to see if it made a difference!

No, I have no interest in buying from a company that at best delayed a product for over 8 months with no compensation
Why don't you go and look at the projections from last July. They were considerably better then!
And no profit is guaranteed, it's the nature of ~~gambling~~ bitcoin

I literally just picked it up again and you really can't hold certain parts too long! Apparently just putting it on its side helps. That's why I was handling it. It seems to have calmed slightly but It's still loud and hot!
@_date: 2013-07-29 23:21:11
Thanks thats not a bad idea at all. I'm in the UK tho! (mentioned beijing to london)
Apparently the third batch have superior temp settings. I was just messing round and told it to cool to 60 and it nearly took off! Its default set to cool to 70 and shut down at 90
I tried underclocking it but it has a noticeable effect on the hash rate but not the temp or fan noise!
@_date: 2013-07-30 12:47:26
I didn't say you cant pick it up. I said there are parts that you cant hold for very long. The box has 6 sides. 5 sides are stone cold to the touch. The other (the hot side) has 4 mounted asic modules, its hardly surprising that its hot
[Also this](
@_date: 2013-07-29 23:24:11
Yeah looks like its always been an issue. Even if I disable one of the modles and underclock its still a noisy bitch
@_date: 2013-07-30 12:25:49
Maybe, its not obscenely high value so could be covered by my contents insurance
Any other type of insurance I would probably have to declare it beforehand which would be bit weird. "How much is this box worth" "Well they have been selling for as much as $30000 on ebay!". Don't think they will buy the bitcoinz rule argument
@_date: 2013-07-30 11:29:32


So that's the heavy hot end? I started it on its side but it kept on restarting. I think I may have had it on its head! Will try again later


Just in case someone else is looking for it (also I assume this is correct!). Firmware[ck.kolivas.org/apps/cgminer/avalon/20130703], [wiki](
Any more resources on changing out the firmware? I'd love even the basic step by step points. WTF is the Avalon firmware SDK?
Yeah very interested if I can get the fan speed down. Seems to be most of the noise. I had seen elsewhere a suggestion to take the PSU out of the case
@_date: 2013-07-30 10:01:18
I feel real bad for you man. I'm certainly not going to defend avalon. Or any asic provider for that matter. I was one of the first in to BTC_FPGA so I can relate
@_date: 2013-07-31 19:50:31
Config is surprisingly challenging. Doesn't help that the thread is long ass. Couldn't get the other firmware to work without the hash rate cycling up and down. They really could use a guide on the config
I had some down time (too long) trying to get that working and just went back to the old firmware and gone up to 325. Seems to be running well. Temp within range but I might switch it back to 300 for the day. Especially tomorrow, its going to be hot here!
@_date: 2013-07-30 20:26:32
Thanks. Maybe ill just do the firmware and tinker with the settings
@_date: 2013-07-30 18:19:57
My avalon is steaming away. Hashing at well over 100 GH/s. Thats a 20% increase since advertised. Yes slightly late but you bought back in september? Thats 3 months? Whats going to happen to the difficulty while you continue to wait for your units? Whats going to happen in a month if you still don't have your unit?


Again, you don't know that. You can't. Not without a crystal ball
I am (at my own surprise) currently projecting to break even in under 2 months. At this rate just over a month. PROJECTING. As in estimated


What? I HAVE my product. In my possession. I can say that it definitely exists. AND it works better than I anticipated. That's a win. So where is yours?
As I said this is all a gamble. I realize that. You don't seem to
@_date: 2013-07-30 02:18:17
I considered flipping it when I saw some of the crazy amounts the pre-orders and new machines have changed hands for (like almost £20,000)
But I'm a big supporter of the technology and well it's a gadget so there was really no decision to be made!
[Its the noise that could change my mind]( and if it does ill let you know!
@_date: 2013-07-30 12:33:21
Like when they are actually going to ship
@_date: 2013-07-29 21:53:06
Just received my 4 module avalon batch 3. Got DHL shipping info only a few days ago. No comms whatsoever since the purchase conformation. So saturday morning it was in Beijing and monday afternoon it made it to London, amazingly. They sent it to the wrong address, I added a billing address just in case I moved or something. The address I gave was my parents, a few weeks ago my parents confirmed that they are selling the house, Just to be certain I went in and changed the billing address to match the (desired) shipping addess. Well lucky they are still a few months away from moving and were in to pick up and then drop off the asic to me after work.
Initial worying thoughts. Its hotter than I anticipated. Its louder than I anticipated. Like too loud regularly, and every now and again it sounds like a jet engine or something. I only have one room and I doubt putting it in a cupboard would do much good for it heat wise. Its hot to the touch. Hotter than any machine I can think of without a heating element. Picking it up in the wrong corner or side can be surprisingly painful!
I ordered the unit with the PSU. Didn't even think about it and regretted it at first. I have seen people bitching about something on Bitcoing talk about not getting the PSU so maybe I dodged a bullet I don't know. I do remember reading a PSU would make it harder to clear customs which obviously was guff. So in the end I was glad I could plug and play and not have to get up in my new toy.
It came with the unit only. No power cord, Ethernet cable (which I can forgive) but no antenna for the router? (although it sits next to my router and can see it fine anyway). I remember in Jeffs batch 1 review he said
"The unit was packed very tightly and securely, with multiple layers of packaging, bubble wrap and Styrofoam.   No instructions or wifi antenna were included, and the included power cord was for a Chinese outlet.  These seem like excusable oversights, given the special shipping procedures and rush to get out The First Package.  Yifu notes here that US customers will receive a US power cord and other accessories"
Lucky US for batch 3? Any commenters? I would mirror what Jeff stresses tho. It was very well packed. Big box with cut to shape styrofoam. Clearly no damage was going to happen to a unit during transit. Save for excessive dropping or stabbing
As you can see from the  last screenshot the device is registering at 94486  MH/s . Its currently running an estimated speed of 96,436.33 MH/s on BTC Guild. It has just peaked 100,000 once or twice which is a very pleasant bonus. I tried to use bitminter at first but couldn't seem to get the unit to connect to the worker.
just got bitminer working, frigging capitilization
--Next day
So I have almost a whole bitcoin (I do have a whole NMC), which seems a little low but given all the messing around with setup and pools i'm not sure if this has been a fair time frame. And obviously PPLNS isn't ideal for a 14 hour mining stint. As I said its getting 100 GH/s at regular clock speed. Over 20% up from advertised (confirmed from unit gui and pool)
--week or so later
Thought i'd come back and add a few thoughts and notes. Pushing the clock speed is very interesting. I seem to be able to get a stable hash of 104 GH/s. Almost completely stable. I'd imagine that's the optimal efficiency. The HW errors seem to be non-existent (&lt;0.1 I think). I have pushed the clock up to 350. The hashrate averages over 110, the high end being 130. Work done shown by bitminter goes up by a very steady 30%. HW errors well within tolerance &lt;2% but it pushes the internal temp up to 66ish. Tolerable but I'm not going to do on hot days.
--pools and bitminter
So I am loving bitminter. I strongly advise people to consider it. You get a very fair reward, [the low fees offset the reduced pay frequency]( If bitminter could get a bit bigger it would easily be the best pool
@_date: 2013-07-30 16:28:49
Oh that's you! I read that page over the weekend. And the one you link to about profitability. Nice dogs!
Thanks very much. I think i'm going to open it up and see what's inside. Then can add a big fan or pull the PSU out to start
@_date: 2013-07-30 12:30:43
It seems to have disabling fail-safes. It stops and goes into a boot loop if it start overheating. But that's only if its on its head or has obscured ventilation
And has no one ever had a hot laptop before? These temps aren't that bad! Certainly not dangerous
Its configured to maintain 70^oC and cut off at 90^oC
And Jeff wrote about the fail-safes in batch 1, I'm really not concerned
@_date: 2013-07-30 12:18:30
As someone who followed the [unnoficial BFL twitter]( for quite some time I disagree. Especially as the BLF updates were shit at best
So they do update more regularly but why update if what you say is more than likely going to be lies. they have proven that time and time again. These units were supposed to start shipping a year ago! Fuck you, we are not shipping anything today is hardly a shipping update!
[I think more to the point I would be horrified if I had made a significant investment in BFL](
@_date: 2013-07-30 20:18:05
But someone else would have the avalon. This is not &gt;You may have your order from your "reputable" company but it sure looks like others don't
Almost missed that. Fuck you. Are you responsible for BFL's errors. I suppose you wouldn't mine? Piss lips?
@_date: 2013-07-30 10:27:05
[Yeah! Let's all go shop at Jim's Drugs down the street!](
@_date: 2013-07-30 10:50:33
Its not as large as it looks, a medium sized desktop, just bigger than an office workstation. Very heavy tho


That was my original intention. I was into BTC_FPGA and was going to supplement with BFL. But life had other plans
If you ordered every single asic when they were announced how many would you have now? Not many if any
@_date: 2013-07-30 10:09:12


daily shipping updates have to be daily
And they hadn't finished developing the product before the initial or secondary shipping dates
And they lied about having a working asic for ages! Remember when avalon pulled out batch 1 and BFL just put 4 months more on its estimates
In conclusion everyone sucks
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:55:52
6 lines down from that. Same post


I'v not had it 24 hours yet. Today I have mostly seen speeds over 100 and up to 114. That's with the standard clock
I do all my investments and returns in GBP. BTC was worth around 50% of what it is now. I actually purchased well under 20 or so but BTC was worth about 35. But I paid 5000 USD effectively. I left most of the presets and set some of the higher wattage setups for the avalon [Looks like this](
@_date: 2013-07-30 09:54:38
He had a fair amount of hardware


So multiple computers with multiple cards. The heat from that would dwarf the avalon. The avalon is exactly like having 1 hot computer
And it doesn't literally sound like jet engine, that was an exaggeration. Maybe a hair dryer would be a closer comparison
I am not concerned about the heat and the noise didn't keep me up last night!
