MtGox is nothing like pirateat40.  No reasonable person would believe that a 7%/week ponzi scheme could pay back all its depositors after a year, because it mathematically impossible.
An exchange that profits from trading fees being able to cover some losses due to duplicate withdrawals and government seizures is plausible, if not likely.

Due to the way most home routers work, software running on the local network will not accept connections from clients external to the network.  This is done for both technical and security reasons.
Routers use Network Address Translation (NAT) to allow multiple devices to connect to the internet using the same external IP.  This creates a problem when accepting external connections.  For example, say you have 3 computers on your local network, each running a bitcoin node on port 8333.  If your router received a connection to your external IP address on port 8333, how would it know which of your 3 bitcoin nodes to connect the external client to?
This is where "Port Forwarding" is used.  To accept external connections, the router must be told which ports to open externally  and which host on the local network to forward incoming requests on this port to.  In the above case, you would tell the router to forward requests to port 8333 one of the bitcoin nodes on your local network.  This functionality is good for security too, as it allows services to run on the local network without exposing themselves to external attackers unless explicitly configured to so by the router.
I believe that a listening node can be set up without port forwarding through the use of UPnP, which bitcoin now supports, but I am not familiar with the specifics of how UPnP works.

The number of connections itself does not cause a problem.  Having a maximum of 8 connections corresponds to bitcoin not being set up to listen to the outside world on port 8333, usually due to a router or firewall.  If a node is not listening for connections, then it can only connect to existing nodes that have their port open.  Nodes without their port open cannot make connections with nodes joining the network or looking for more connections.  By running a node without the port open, you are essentially taking resources from the network but not giving anything back yourself.
TL;DR:  Port 8333 Closed = Leeching, Port 8333 Listening = Seeding

That is not a transaction fee, it is change.  Bitcoin transactions consist of a set of inputs and a set of outputs, if desired payment does not match the sum of inputs exactly, the excess is returned to the sender's wallet in the form of change.
On blockchain.info you can click on the transaction id to view more details of the transaction, including the fee paid.

MtGox currently has two US withdrawal options:
1) Pay no fee, wait indefinitely
2) Pay a 5% fee, wait a shorter but still not definite time
As far as I know, the only people getting USD wires sent are the ones paying the fee.

Wow. Batch 3 units were supposed to ship early May.  It is ridiculous that they are shipping chips before batch 3.

It is standard practice for exchanges to do this, and was the action previously taken by Mtgox in June 2011. More recently, Vircurex cleared their order books after their outage this weekend.

It could mean that 30%/50% of the fee the ATM operator charges to customers goes to Robocoin.  In this case, if the ATM charges 5%, then Robocoin receives 1.5%/2.5%.
