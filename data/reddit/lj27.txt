This is actually good news is a meme that somewhat caught on in this sub.

You could probably say the same for the people who haven't read Keynes
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:52:51
Just curious, are you worried about the security? Or are you keeping it

There's only one thing worse than not getting a joke, and that's getting the joke too late (why didn't you notice the original grammar error?)

When you think about it, the scammer really got a cheap lesson anyway. Now he will come back with more knowledge and better photoshop skills!

Is there a way to short bitcoin?

Disclaimer; I don't know much about bitcoin, but judging by most threads on r/bitcoin, you would believe that people care more about capitalizing on the crypto currencies speculation of value as opposed to using it as a median to facilitate the exchange of goods.

Mr. Winkleberg, when are you going to create platform that facilitates the trading of SchruteBucks(§) to BTC?

Still surprising that the rate at which people adopted electricity was slower than the rate at which people adopted the TV.

Math. How does it even work?
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:42:16
Good point. I was going to mention why cars were so slow on the uptake as well, but that's also tied to the road network and other infrastructure development.

But what about the World Cup?

Same can be said for anything. The people on the other side of the fence rarely see the issue how you see it, which is the point. If they were to explain "how it works" that would mean they are in agreement with you.
Rather, they are trying to show how it **doesnt** work.

Another level to give you a false sense of security

I'll try to be more positive:
The additional security feature is meant to give a would-be hacker another loop he has to jump. Knowing that hackers and security breach experts have much better things to do with their time, this should be enough to stop them dead in their tracks. Good job

Will you do 5% of the transaction? That's a cool 0.25 doge in your pocket

This is actually good news though, right?
