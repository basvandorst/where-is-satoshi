Thank you. While my immediate family is tech savvy, some members of my family are not. I wouldn't want them to have been completely lost, so I made sure to not only create that document, but I also answered every question I could while we were gathered together.

Thank you kindly.

I'm going to guess not. The username seems entirely random, and poking at that link in a sandboxed browser seems to just 404.

When I was putting these together, I made more than I needed just in case we had any unexpected visits from out-of-state family members. The one pictured above is one of the extras, so technically it is mine.
Because I keep transaction records for myself, I still have the public addresses of the other wallets (though not the private addresses). That said, I wouldn't post any of them without asking the family if they were comfortable with it.
That one being mine, however, I'm totally ok with it. Given the public address can only be used for deposits and balance checking, I see no reason to be worried.

I designed the document that's holding the wallet, but not the wallet itself. All credit for the wallet goes to Canton Becker, who is--as I understand it--the person behind this website here:

I took the time to write up and format the letter myself, yes. And I'd be happy to share it.
ODT Format (Original): 
DOC Format: 
I'm from the US, so you may need to make adjustments if you're not printing on 11 by 8.5 letter paper. Also, if you look closely, you can see two very faint, barely visible grey lines. You can use these to fold the paper neatly into thirds without needing to make any measurements. And of course be sure to replace "X.XX Bitcoins" with the amount you intend on handing out.
I imagine you're familiar with the paper wallet, but for anyone that's not, you can find it here: 
When printed out on a 11 by 8.5 piece of paper at full size, the paper wallet should be just the right size to slip into the holder at the bottom of the printout. Depending on printers though, your mileage may vary.
Feel free to use the printout as you please. I'm always happy to see more people using Bitcoin, and gifting is a great way to encourage it.
As for your other question, it was a choice between saving a copy of their private keys to provide them with help in the future, or destroying all of my copies so that they felt in complete control of their Bitcoin. Ultimately I opted for the latter; I wanted them to feel they had 100% control over what I was giving them. After all, Bitcoin has always been so much about giving people complete control over their money; it would feel wrong retaining those private keys unless they specifically wanted me to do so for them.
