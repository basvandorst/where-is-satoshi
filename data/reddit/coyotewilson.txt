Ive more than tripled my position doing this I just didn't mean for it to send to my bank account
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:31:09
Im assuming I have to wait for this to clear into my account then buy back 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:20:32
I was meaning for it to just go into my coinbase account!!!! I was going to swing trade it !!!

I have a feeling that wall street isn't going to make this an extremely obvious pump and dump and make money just once. This isn't going to be a bloodbath of selling on the first day. Just hold and let them know they can't scare us out of our assets.

Really the only thing anyone is afraid is Wall Street has the money to influence the price up take out a futures position saying the price will decrease and they withdrawal their funds creating mass panic to all the weak hands who sell. Price plummets and then rinse and repeat.

I wasnt meaning to get out for good!!

Is big money moving this price up only to withdraw and short ? As a trader of penny stocks you see this time and time again MM

you can get caught with your pants down on how fast it moves. But I did it for a while and increased my holding position which was nice. hard for the price to move if selling occurs so holding elevates the price at a higher rate.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:49:50
I don't remember saying I was selling. It shuts down buys as well.
