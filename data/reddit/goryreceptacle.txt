Certainly do your own due diligence and ensure you're investing into something you believe in, unless you're just trading trends.

Hard when I'm glued to 3 screens. I did get liquidated on one but recovered it on the next one. I check reddit on the slow times. LOL

Bitmex for leverage and Binance for alts. I used to arbitrage and used several charts to watch the same coin/token but not anymore.

No thanks to trades like that. Sure more profits but that's a waste.

What if I told you I'm up 2,800%? 
@_date: 2018-08-11 22:55:45
Oh, I am!
@_date: 2018-08-28 21:17:45
LOL!! Nah, just crypto.
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:07:40
Ah.. Okay!

Did you trade during Feb 7-14, April 10-30, July 14-current? Sure it's a bear market but there are still many support levels you can buy that hit often. We've rebounded 15%+ from 6k range several times. Sure might not work all the time and no I don't go for those 10% profits. I go for 2%-4% regularly with 1%-2% stop losses and it turns out to be much safer however but I don't always see the 10% gains but they do come. I'm still up over 1,000% from last year.

This is pretty much the exact same thing I do! Yes it's a lot tougher during these times but it's still very possible. When it's rough like this is when I shoot for those smaller gains which came often, still. In a bull market we're a little more greedy and can make that 10% easily which is mainly what I'm referring to I suppose.
