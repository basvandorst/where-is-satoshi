NASA's main goal is not to build rockets. It's main goal is to further our understanding of the universe and develop tech that helps to accomplish these goals. Tons of these goals could never be accomplished through private industry because there is simply no profit in it. One company in the private sector has surpassed NASA in chemical rocket development but without multiple entities that can compete with each other the sls will continue to be developed. Someday when multiple private industries can taxi NASA's experiments to space then they will stop making chemical rockets and focus on the next tech that is out of reach of industry.

More power to them. You get to do some really cool stuff for those companies and for some that's worth it but you can make a lot more money while spending a lot less time elsewhere.

They are the coolest thing I've seen in my lifetime but I don't think I would personally work there with that kind of time commitment

That's not true at all. Places like NASA develop technologies that would obviously fail in the private industry and once they are further developed they release the information to the public for free. Without NASA's role in rocket development and the enormous subsidies and paydays they give SpaceX then it would have failed horribly. It's just a fact that some technologies will not make any money without generations of development through government work.

This is the true. Many of my friends from college went to the big space companies and the one who went to SpaceX was averaging a 76 hour work week at one point.
