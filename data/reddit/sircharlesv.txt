Nothing like spending tangible universally accepted currency to purchase invisible sparsely accepted tokens (not a currency doesn't hold value) in a gamble to hopefully sell those tokens later for the original tangible universal currency to purchase a depricating asset which requires expensive insurance and is terrible on 99 percent of public roadways.
(I know OP didn't buy a Lambo but also no one really should because they are money pits.)

Ummmm, no. This is why corporations are evil. They aren't innovative they are breaking the law to boost profits &amp; pay dividends, they take the fine because they still come out ahead.
Bitcoin is STILL not worthy of being considered a currency &amp; cannot compete with Visa or Mastercard for transactions per second &amp; way more energy intensive.

As an investment instrument 10 to 15 years is considered long term.
As a form of currency, just look at the currencies around the world. Some are new, some are OLD, very few experience the roller-coaster that Bitcoin does. If the Euro was worth 1 today at 9am &amp; 3 of itself by noon then less than 1 by 3pm &amp; 1.25 of itself by 6pm it would make a very difficult economic sense to attempt to purchase labor or goods with that Flux.

Which is why it is STILL an utter failure as both. It doesn't hold value as a currency should &amp; its too volatile to be a realistic investment instrument for many.
:edit bring on those "I disagree with you" downvotes. Not those this isn't a valuable comment downvotes.

Wow. One person on reddit. Now the actually cost you paid will rise &amp; fall for decades. (8 million dollar pizza, or whatever)
I'm glad you use it like a currency, but a few true believes don't change the HODL groupthink.

It hasn't existed in the long term yet. &amp; in the medium term it hasn't been as stable as most large circulating currencies. I want it to be a success, but the system it wishes to replace needs it to endlessly rise &amp; fall to discourage individuals from using crypto in general as a medium of exchange.
Until the "invest in bitcoin" Era ends it will be a failed currency &amp; at best a gamblers paradise. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:51:29
Oh, I'm sorry I chose a great example of what a currency should be....stable.

Does anyone see the possibility of Bitcoin expanding from Singapore kind of like domino theory (but in developing power) next it will be allowed in Indonesia, up into the Southern Asian continent. Once most of South Asia is on board China will be forced to allow it on a broad scale. That is when Bitcoin goes global as a viable currency alternative.

Depending what making it means. 
Bitcoin is so volatile that isn't not a good currency &amp; I don't expect it to transition from a financial instrument to a working transfer of payment. 
Bitcoin Cash has the makings of a less volatile currency. Which could act more successful as a transfer system because the value is more knowable over time. 
TLDR - currency only works when its in circulation. When the value of the currency is volatile, especially volatile up, people will no circulate the currency but hold it as the value rises. Making it an investment not a transfer of value.

No. 1000 USD in Bitcoin could be worth 800 when she arrives in Greece. Not smart.

A 1500% increase over 40 years is a lot, but Bitcoin is (supposed) to be a currency, currencies hold value will Bitcoin does not.
A four year degree is dumb if you don't need to to do your chosen work, a 2 year general education post HS will be (market mandated) in a decade.

Example of why Bitcoin is not a currency.
It's a gambling unit.
@_date: 2019-10-12 17:40:04
Don't avoid my true statement that you won't trade your "currency" today for goods or services by suggesting my $20 today could get me a steak dinner, but tomorrow it's value could buy me a restaurant. It's not going to happen.
Currency is a medium for exchange of all goods or services in a society. Bitcoin is largely not used as a medium of exchange for any goods or services because it's value today is not a good indication of its value tomorrow. Go take a theory class in something beside 10wayzBitcoinMakeMeRicch's YouTube.

Golds value did not increase or decrease by 5% in the markets of antiquity.
I'm sorry Bitcoin will not be a currency. A cryptographic currency will rise, but it won't be Bitcoin, especially as new cryptographic purposes are developed.

Raising the stakes, why Bitcoin &amp; not literally any of the other thousand cryptographic &amp; physics limited digital tokens?
Bitcoin is not uniquely designed as better for the customers.
Edit: grammatical fix. Stakes not steaks
@_date: 2019-10-12 18:49:07
Perfect so we agree, Bitcoin is hardly different than a company's stockholders. Early adopters/investors are rewarded for their risk by the increasing value of their holdings &amp; should they choose to they can sell their holds for profit.
It's a gambling unit &amp; should be regulated like all other investment tools.

Explain how my small business accepting a currency that can fluctuate 5% on a day, is still not accepted as a payment by my vendor, &amp; that my older employees won't accept as payment because how do I explain Bitcoin to Betsy!
Bitcoin is not a currency, it is an instrument of speculation.
@_date: 2019-10-12 18:42:23
Again avoiding the actual topic to divert to my grammatical error.
Maybe one day voice to text will be able to understand steaks versus stakes.

Go out &amp; spend your Bitcoin.
I dare you.
But you won't because it could buy more tomorrow then if could by today. Sure 20 years ago a 50 dollar bill bought more but so did 50 yen.
Go now buy that pizza with your Bitcoin. You won't.
It's not a functional currency.
@_date: 2019-06-17 10:55:32
It's scarce yeah. But can someone explain why owning an individual bitcoin matters when the instrument can be divided almost endlessly. If the point is bitcoin as a instrument is scarcer than human millionaires. Cool a numerical facts, but it's tells you nothing about the soundness of the instrument.
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:10:41
so what. if one bitcoin was worth 20 million dollars (because it has become an investment instrument not a currency) owning half a bitcoin is 10 million.
This is the most worthless statement.
