when I was a kid I thought bistromathics was incredibly profound... I'm a dumby

I agree, I'm not.

What is it you think people are hoping to gain by making new accounts to post here?  If it was an attempt to influence the market, they'd be downplaying the drop to try to slow the hemorrhaging of their investment.  What's being shilled?

is that where your stake in bitcoin is now worth $21?

Ahh, that makes sense.  Thank you.

that was great :)
This is all going by memory, but there was a small boy around 20 years ago who was supposed to have the highest IQ ever measured, who was teaching at Harvard at the age of 9, things like that.  For a little while there (a year? in that range) he got a good chunk of publicity for it, with his (single) mom milking this super-genius thing to get a lot of speaking invitations (for him) and public appearances, and have his reputation function as her meal ticket.
Eventually it turned out to be mostly a con by the mom.  The kid was very bright, but--for example--she'd helped him cheat on the IQ tests, by asking the test administrator to please leave the room, because his initially merely-high-average scores in the testing were low (for a super genius) because the administrator made him nervous.  The administrator cooperatively left the room, the mom stayed in the room and helped him answer all of the questions, and he gets an IQ result in the 300 range.  
(IQ test scores are normalized by age; results that would get an adult in, say, the 120 range, would read as something like 200 for a young child, because his score is so superior to peers in the same age bracket--other 9 year olds--even though it's not exceptional for an adult.)
The teaching at Harvard thing?  When the mom's con started to unravel, journalists reached out to people who'd been there, students/grad students and the like.  Turns out he hadn't taught a course; he'd been invited to speak there.  As for what he said, witnesses said that he seemed like a nice kid and pretty bright, but he didn't really say much of substance, that it was kind of generic stuff about mankind's hopefully utopian future.  They just hadn't been skeptical of it, because they didn't want to pressure a child, he was good natured, and he was just a guest speaker anyway.
I think, when I'd last read about it, that by that point the mother was being observed by child protective services (once journalists poked holes in the super-einstein-child scam she'd been pushing on everyone, people started to worry about how she was raising him, and the worries turned out to be well founded).
I wondered how he would turn out as a teen and adult, given that she'd set him up to be majorly emotionally fucked, by pressuring him into this con during major formative years of his life, and making him think he had to pretend to be a genius just to live up to what everyone thought he was.

Dude.  It was some gallows humor while I watch the price crash and take my tiny investment with it.  You're overreacting.

The sub is flooded with people downplaying the drop (perhaps with good reason--I have no idea which way the market's headed--although a lot of the dogged optimism does look less than sincere), and one small joke in the opposite direction gets this reaction?  It's a little amazing to watch.

Sure, but for the many who were at any point dismayed by a particularly shitty turn of behavior by a mod, they'd have a very simple and low-effort way to exclude that mod's actions, without overcoming the incomparably greater inertia needed for a large diverse group to organize a move to a particular new replacement subreddit.  The solution doesn't have to be close to ideal to be a huge improvement.
