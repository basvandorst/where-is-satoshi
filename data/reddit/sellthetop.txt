do you have to pay social contributions too ?
what if its your professional activity
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:05:26
yes but what about professionals, u need to have a status, or can u trade without any status as an "unemplyed person"
if wanna be very secure : are you sure as a self employed in LLC
social contribution are capped to 2280 RON ?
when i search on the internet : 
Freelancers deriving income from independent activities will be liable to pay pension and health insurance contributions (25% and 10%, respectively) on their monthly gross minimum salary (although they may opt to pay pension contributions corresponding to a higher income level of their choice). Currently, freelancers pay pension insurance (10.5% or 26.3%) and health insurance (5.5%) contributions on their realised income.

I had answer from lawyers in romania : 
An needed correction
 
The corporate profit tax in Romania is 16% not 10%
The 10% is the income tax paid by physical persons, not by companies.
So in your case will be 16% on gross profit + 5% dividend on net profit + 500 EUR Health Contributions
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:20:03
so you just pay 10% corporate tax, 5% dividend tax
and 500 euros per year social contribution thats all ?
I meant the loss you made while trading on platforms. For example you are doing 1000 trades, some lose, some wins, u can see only whats the amount of cashout to the bank and says its the profits ? no matter whats the trade on platforms ?
Do you know any lawyer or accountant that could help me, i want tto relocate there

is it possible to do it througth an LLC ? 
i see everywhere there is a 5% tax on dividends from this LLC
it seems less risky than what u say cause isnt there a 30% social contribution in romania on salary and not capped to 500 euros ?

oh gosh this is way different to my country where u need  to own a status u cant simply be statueless and jobless and work fulltime as a trader
so theres no risk if u make big profit in trading that they ask u something like 35% on this profit, this will always be capped to something as low as few thousand RON
(thought they removed any cap for salaries in 2018)

okay, i am contacting lawyers firm to get this confirmed
