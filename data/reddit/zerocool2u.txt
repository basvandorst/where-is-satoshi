If I buy and sell enough BTC, can I make the graphs go different colors too?

Yeah, I was gonna call them too, but I took a nap instead.

Beautiful idea. I'm hoping to do something similar for a project in the next year as I finish my undergraduate CS degree.

Yup, see my edit.

In the US a circle account is FDIC insured, so you're dealing less risk of an exchange going under and just losing all your money. 
EDIT: My bad, it's insured just not through FDIC. Seems to be a company named Marsh Insurance. Either way, that's vastly more protection than you'd get from most accounts/exchanges. See here:

I concur. Why waste our energy on something as monumental as attempting to gain the trust of entire societies, when there are easier ways to focus it's potential. I'm particularly excited about its potential to increase the scale of moderate size businesses internationally. What's more if this hyperloop thing somehow works out, suddenly there's the potential for cheap long range *fast* transactions among businesses smaller than say a huge corp.
