It even (theoritically) could make sense this way:
What if... This is Satoshi and he invented Bitcoin in the future. He thought the world needs to be free of FIAT sooner so he also invented the time machine and went back in the past to invent it sooner.
However, some wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff happened and he created an alternate universe. It was a little different so he didn't know if his parents even existed. He jacks a car, speeds to his parents' house to see if they are actually there and at the last turn he hits a woman, who turns out to be his mom! He gets in jail, when he got out after a couple of years, he went to their home and issued an apology in person. Wife starts shouting at him "I can't have children because of you! This is all your fault! The insurence doesn't pay for IVF anymore and it hasn't worked so far!". Satoshi realized the mistake he made. **If he can't be born he will never exist!**
He used his time machine to go back to 2008. He released *Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System* then implemented the bitcoin software as open source code and released it on 3 January 2009. 
*Sidenote: OP's wife got hit in a car accident by a mysterious man who's identity never existed. The couple try IVF until the insurence pays. Unfortunately, baby Satoshi didn't come.*
He waited and waited until 2015. He left a message on OP's voicemail explaining he needs to buy bitcoin NOW because the price is going to be so high. Signed off with the name 'Satoshi'. OP invested a little bit in Bitcoin, he sold and rebought in bubbles and made a bit of money. 
But all stories come to an end: until 2017 OP made enough money with Bitcoin that they can now pay for the IVF and after the first try they had a wonderful boy! They named him Satoshi.
Edit: originally intended to remove plotholes, made even more, bc of my lack of writing skills. Don't be too hard on me. I tried so hard but got so far.

In my country this was a huge thing because CHF mortgages were sooo cheap back then. This was before the global financial crisis. CHF got stronger and stronger compared to our currency and the total amount of money you had to (have to, sadly) pay increased by a lot. A lot of families went to rock bottom financially. Of course, this happened everywhere in the world, but here it was especially bad because it was so popular.
Unfortunately the whole system is corrupt bottom to top. It's in the law that it should be the way it is now, and of you try to do anything else, you get blacklisted, and if you stop paying the mortgage slowly they will take away your belongings for auctioning and the end game here is losing your home (which gets auctioned as well). 
These auctions are rigged, the city council's auctioner and some people at the auction agree with a relative/friend on a very very reasonable price, relative/friend gets the VERY cheap stuff, they resell and split the profit between each other. 
You can be free of debt in 3 ways: 
1. You pay back (for us 400% of the original deal) the mortgage 
2. City council auctions your belongings (whichever they choose to pick up), if it covers the mortgage you're free (although they bring down the pre-set price to very small amounts for more profit, and to get the house as well)
3. You lose your house that the mortgage was registered on after step 2. (Relative/friend gets the house, sells it for the actual value, makes around 50-75% profit, which as I mentioned gets split between the auctioner and some people at the auction) 
Yay you're free now. If at this point you don't have a lot of money put in banks or another place to live (which is not common at all for poor people) you're fucked. 
The whole system is rigged, it's in nobody's interest to help us, not the government, not the city council, and especially not the bank.
Edit: I don't really know how this all works too, I just know what the government and banks order us to do, how much we have to pay back and what happens when you don't do it.

They could straight out just ban it/criminalize using it. But at this point it's too late IMO, it would cause massive outrage. This is why I think that cryptocurrencies won't just die. (And for that reason, the bubble won't pop, just grow bigger/shrink).

Oh that reminds me, what happened to the guy?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:24:26
We use a credit card because the interest is very very low (until you don't pay back all the debt after one mont) + the bank gives back 1-4% of all transactions in coupons (I know, so cheap, but hey, that's life). There is no debt on it (well, there is during the month but we always pay it back before the next billing date). This way we get a small % back but we have to be very careful with it.
Most of our debt comes from a shitty CHF mortgage and even after stabilizing it to local currency the amount we need to pay is enormous compared to what we actually signed up for. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:47:21
That's pretty arrogant to think. Do you think a 6-member family with $1500 income/ month wouldn't kill for 15k to pay off debts? (it's eating up $700/month). We don't have enough money for proper food, I eat very small amount of food (breakfast with eggs before heading to college, one meal mostly a small menu at a fast food restaurant during the stay of 12-14hrs in the city and one dinner at home). I'm starving 60% of the day, barely can pay for my medicine, hell sometimes don't even buy it so I can buy anti depressants for my bipolar sister and you don't think we have very big problems if $15k would solve them. With that amount of money the monthly payment for the banks could be cut down 50% at minimum, giving us $400-500 extra a month. Athough it's true it wouldn't solve it completely.
Sorry for the rant, I hope you see people's problems differently.

Thanks :) Although I'm 100% sure we would just easen up the mortgage. True that money could always be used more wisely (for example what if I invested that said $15k in bitcoin and withrew $150k a couple months later) - we don't know the future so we can only be so wise.

Agree with both of you in a way, I think rich ppl have to find the ethical boundaries. There are sooo many shitty people up there, just to squish every .01% of profit out of the common people. Huge companies putting together so much money just so they could make even more money unethically (see: comcast) is not fucking modern human nature. It goes back to our barbarian roots, and we need to abandon this as we abandoned raping women. We should support each other if we wan't to thrive.

They could just say (and implement a law accordingly) "Using any cryptocurrency is against the law". Which won't happen in a democracy. That's my point. That's why cryptocurrencies in general are not a bubble. They can't be just terminated and removed from existence.

Point is, that's a fuckton of money which he can't/doesn't want to put in a highly speculative market? Months/years ago that 10 BTC might have not seemed like an insane amount of money but 140k is like a yearly salary of a senior programmer.

@_date: 2017-12-09 19:45:42
I'm no expert so I don't know, I'm basing my prediction on that it makes sense for them to do this for $$$. Wall Street is definitely not interested in blockchain technology and the future of bitcoin (yet?), they are speculators. Their intention is not making BTC the next USD, so they just want to milk this while they can. What's the most effective way to do this if they have billions of dollars? Manipulate the market.
My thoughts behind this are plausible, and I'm just guessing here like the rest of us. I'm looking forward to the coming days, it's going to be exciting.

And you didn't use credit card... So the fee seems extremely high. If you would have paid by cc, they cut 4% which seems to be your case (approx), but you're not using cc wtf.
Depending on the method they should have charged 1.5% or $50+2.5%. If they have to convert fiat, they charge exchange fee too. I have no idea what happened here. I think you should write to support so you understand this better.
Personally I wouldn't touch coinbase, their fees are extremely high.

Yeah that's a terrible idea 100% (last paragraph), I had some money saved up and I still do, I could have invested into bitcoin earlier. I'm not going to live on the streets if this fails, so I'm gambling my $500 saved up money (it was for a new phone - don't really need it, current one is fine). Maybe I will lose the opportunity to buy a phone or maybe it will double over the course of few months/who-the-fuck-knows-with-btc.

After researching more about cryptocurrencies and bitcoin in general I feel like this really could be the future. I'm hoping the time comes when there will be no need to get out of BTC. Although right now we don't know its future and it's really dangerous to put most of your assets in an unstable currency but what's even more dangerous is to use this as a short term investment. I hope people realize that this could be much bigger than just speculation.
I'm going to slowly pour money into this as long as it shows that it works. My savings are really *really* insignificant compared to the amount of money is in this but I could be one of the "few" that get lucky in the long run. If bitcoin becomes big the value of my "worthless" savings could skyrocket.
