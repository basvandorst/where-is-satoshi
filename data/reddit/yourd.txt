Remember that these are early addresses. The coin was worth nothing; it was simply an academic exercise at the time. There's no particular reason to be careful with addresses when you're running a lot of tests. In fact the honest thing would be to drop any addresses associated with the development effort.

It depends what you mean by "control". He could have engaged in any number of dodgy accounting practices. He could have lent them to a paper subsidiary, for example.
Personally I hope that he used them to secure a line of credit from the local Yakuza, and they're currently carving bits of his body off.

It's the big chest of useless gold in the corner. It's stuffing money under the mattress.

You are not saving by "investing" in coin. It's simple speculation, or, worse, mercantilism. It's not capital; it doesn't produce anything. 
[Edit: I didn't mean to imply that speculation is bad]

The mistake this graphic makes is conflating utility with price per unit.
