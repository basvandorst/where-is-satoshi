Yep. I buy my btc from coinbase here in Canada and they don’t have a sell option for us yet. Works for me!

You only “lose” when you sell. If your still holding you’re fine because it will go up.

Oh okay. So I get that a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger is the best and most secure way, but a wallet such as breadwallet will still give me full control over my coins as a private key right? Where as coinbase is just an exchange and I do not own the private keys to my btc. Am I understanding this correctly? So even if I don't have a "hardware wallet" before the fork, it is still a good idea to have my coins in a wallet like breadwallet so I actually own them. Thanks for the replies by the way. 
Edit: forgot to ask, is the fork still scheduled for mid November?

The cost of living in Australia is not the same as the USA, or really anywhere else. I just spent 7 months in Australia last winter and its stupid expensive.

Yes I've seen a few posts regarding coinbase going back and forth on the issue. So if I put my btc on a hardware wallet such as breadwallet, how do I go about receiving this new coin? Will it be there as well or do I have to claim it somehow? 
Also if I were to leave it on coinbase my understanding is that my bitcoin will unaffected and I just won't be entitled to any of the new coin. Is this correct or will it affect my btc?
