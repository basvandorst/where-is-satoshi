People have been saying that since the first bounce back after the 1k gox crash. It's amusing at this point. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:02:47
Can you explain how it can only go up 300x?
@_date: 2015-12-09 18:06:05
i've read the article but at this point its a swirl fest for me. Am i understanding right that the email used as part of the stories backup is incorrect and not the one believed to have been used by SN?

Mozilla now started accepting Bitcoin donations. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 19:49:14
Well I'm glad I tested that with a small amount because I'm encountering issues with the send bitcoin tab. When I go to send from one wallet to another it duplicates the transaction within the origin wallet and just subtracts the fees. Won't be using this until it's fixed. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 19:06:06
You do know you an encrypt your private key before you print the paper wallet. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 04:01:20
No. Sending to another wallet. It's the "from" account selector that screws up. If I don't sleet a from address it works fine. If I attempt to select a from address from the drop down it tries to send it to itself.

I've been googling for the last few hours to try and find an answer to my question with 0 luck. This is in reference to the Bearwhale sale. 
What service,exchange, software, etc allows you to set up a buy/sell order for a future date? I don't see anything explaining how you set a sell wall up. 
I get why the buy/sell wall is, I just don't understand how one goes about setting one up. 
Thanks.

Or provide them with a free Order Coupon to say thank you. That will keep the good service coming.  
@_date: 2014-07-26 01:42:02
Great job OP, thanks. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 18:33:27
Thank you. I figured as much. Don't folks in the US have problems using those exchanges? 
@_date: 2014-09-11 03:23:10
Could you please tell me what else this week Coinbase released? Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 04:02:05

Good job Coinbase!
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:57:40
So do our boners. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:32:53
In addition an explanation would be greatly appreciated.

I keep hearing folks say that he primed it by processing the first sell wall IIRC 10-12k then set the next wall at 20k Or so. 
I get why the buy/sell wall is, I just don't understand how one goes about setting one up. 
Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 17:21:06
Yeah, I need to figure out how to contact the developers. Thanks. 
Any favorite HD wallets that support those encryption standards and allow wallet import?
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:25:10
these turned out great. I love the first one. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 17:36:33
oh, I could use my laptop to import as well, iOS isnt a constraint. Thank you
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:13:21
Exact same story here. But then I figured I would recoup some loss by picking up more when it dipped to 400. Oh crap man.   
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:54:50
Could we organize a multi-sig wallet that feeds a changetip account?
@_date: 2014-11-12 23:03:40
At least in California they are unable to decrease your balance or charge maint fees.
@_date: 2014-12-05 16:06:00
Well if it's true it wouldn't be unexpected but also very sad. Why do people have to be so deceptive. 
I tipped his "kid".  I wonder how much of tips he collected? 
@_date: 2014-10-08 03:42:05
I apologize for my lack of any real real technical knowledge concerning the block and some of its intricacies. This fork or change you are all speaking of does it open up the community and its users for theft or loss of use somehow? It sounds as if it's a necessary change, however when money is involved it can be difficult to trust complete strangers. Regardless of how well you think you might know these folks. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:51:19
You ever figure it out?
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:51:00
I just downloaded it 45min ago with 0 issues. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 21:28:20
Any idea on a iOS release? Thanks 
@_date: 2014-10-07 03:48:36
Well, from what I can see,  neither Coinbase or Circle allow it. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:39:48
Well now I'm not glad I wasted money on some USB thumbs to be used for a cold storage option. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 06:49:31
Would you mind telling me where I could find when the vulnerable period Was? 
@_date: 2014-12-10 05:41:20
I would love a detailed explanation of what the heck you guys are talking about in right here. I get the basics, just not what you and the guy above your are taking about.

i was told by a tax attorney on here that if you bought something with bitcons that you would be required to pay taxes on it, not sure though. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 17:25:37
it's cute that you think they will even care. They will just askwhen you lost them, asses a market value and then charge you the tax. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 17:26:35
mine were instant because I was verified.

You don't you don't understand it yet, it's not even anonymous.
 It's a beautiful technology. 
I invested because I believe that it was an interesting concept and had potential for future gains. I do treat it as an investment. And it's been very good to me.

So if we have some coins in a mycelium wallet or in a trezor or ledger wallet, we should just leave them until after the dust settles? 
@_date: 2017-05-02 23:35:27
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:27:40
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:33:25
So lets say sam has 2 BTC in a mycelium wallet. What does Sam need to do to keep HODL'ing and not get screwed somehow?
What about he same situation but with a Trezor?

So ethereum is just another crypto? I was under the impression that it was some side chain fork for Bitcoin block chain.

Just the tip

What happens to your money in your savings account?   the federal government continues to print dollars. they create more debt.
 What you save, cit eventually devalues unless you have large gains in the marketplace through Investments. Bitcoin curves some of that deflation, it is actually the opposite. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 04:22:46
I actually suggest the bread wallet over this wallet for now. The lack of pw/pin bothers me. 
Edit: stupid autocorrect. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:35:50
They would lock you up until you figure it out
