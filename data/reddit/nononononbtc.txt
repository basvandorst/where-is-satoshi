Hey man thank you for taking the time to post that detailed response.  Sadly, after restoring my wallet successfully to Electrum with Bip39 all tramnsactions showed up except the 1.7 BTC one that is missing. :(((  I posted a link to the transaction abobe if you would like to take a look, currently ay 36 confirmations and still not in my wallet.
I also cleared my cached, good suggestion, but alas no luck..

Tried this many times, and also restored in Electrum, and nothing, no money in wallet, no history of it in my transactions.  It is possible that there just aren't enough confirmations for some bizarre reason and I just need to wait?  It's been close to 12 hours.

Here is an old post by Mycelium wallet that says under New Features: "No more address reuse".  So I am not very hopeful. :(((((  WTF that's fucked up if true, it should keep it for a day or two at least, or else I'm guessing a LOT of people are going to lose money!!!

Here it is, the one for 1,7 BTC is the one that nevber showed up.  The one below it (it got split into 2 for some reason) I received just fine in about 5 minutes.

Mycelium says in a post here that you can't with their wallet, it says "no more address reuse" in their new features section:

Yeah, see my post above, Mycelium made an old post saying "no more address reuse".  So I'm not hopeful.  Can't believe they can't let me reuse the address for even 24 hours or something, I did the 2nd transaction after only 10 minutes or so.
