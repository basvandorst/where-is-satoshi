Bro. Look at you search history. Youre either dumb or lying. You searched "bitcoin binaance" which lead you to the hack site not 2 minutes after you were alresdy on Binance. Stop using google as a bookmark service!

I own both and Trezor is just better. Its more intuitive and easier to use for the average user. It took me 2 days to get Ripple installed on my Nano S. I simply could not recommend the device to a novice user at this time. 
EDIT: Im a former MCSE and CompTIA certified computer tech with 15+ years in web development. I'm no idiot and I know how to use these devices. While a majority of you may have had no issue there are some that do. I tried to install Ripple and NEO on my Nano and for the first 36 hours I kept getting the "could not install app" error. I tried it on two separate pc's and still it continued to fail. 
I've actually owned both the older style and the newer style Nano and neither of them worked as easily as my Trezor does. The original Nano sucked so bad I just never used it (i bought a pair of them and they sit in my safe unused to this day) and I gave them a 2nd chance with the new one but once again the Trezor just works right out of the box where the Nano has now failed me twice actually.

Find a ProTrader in your area preferably with 500+ trades of significant volume and strong feedback. Actually read some feedback and determine if the trader sells a lot or buys a lot. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:54:14
they have no proof of where your coins come from and you never have to show it to them. tell them he bought the coins at $100 each (or some other random number) and pay the capital gains.

Hes not an investor. I seriously doubt he realized what effect he would have. Its more likely he was told what to do and when by someone bigger than him.

Well from a conspiratorial view it was Tether that pumped the price and the Gox coins that crashed it. If some group was able to coordinate that it would be a pretty grand conspiracy and a guaranteed major money maker. The timing of the sells is suspect. Actually everything to do with the Gox coins is suspect. I'm not sure they are linked or related but its not impossible.
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:53:47
You seem to be one of the few that understands this. There is a reason he sold that specific amount of coins. That's exactly what he was ordered to sell to satisfy the judgement. The remaining bitcoins may as well be furniture or any other corporate asset. Legally they'll belong to Karpeles.

You are correct. Its more like .2% actually. My mistake. Too much going on this morning to pay attention. I knew it seemed statistically insignificant to me really but I'm not an economist or mathematician obviously. 
I think if a group of people had the power to print Tethers on demand that increased the price at will and then also had the ability to get this guy to sell the GOX coins with market orders at the right time you have a setup for making a fuckton of money.
Someone had to know what was going on. This guy didnt just singlehandedly crash the market by mistake. It was orchestrated.

Fair enough, 40k is more but still only about 2% of all available coins.
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:27:39
so all it takes is ~~6000~~ bitcoin to crash it like that? how many other wallets hold that amount or greater? how strong is bitcoin if such an insignificant portion of it can have such a great effect? I wont bother to math but 6000 is pretty small in a world with 21 million bitcoin
Okay, its 40k coins which is just over 2% of the currently available supply of bitcoin. Is 2% enough to rocck bitcoin like that? Apparently so
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:59:09
The truth may actually lie in the middle on this one. Its probably not a full blown conspiracy but rather obvious some people knew and most others didn't. Some of this can be explained by an inexperienced trade making panic moves but its does fit a conspiracy narrative well.

Bitcoin is no longer a threat to the remittance industry. Bitspark is just the latest to drop bitcoin over fees. It makes you wonder what role Western Union has in the all of this blocksize nonsense.

I recently purchased some precious metals from a large online dealer using bitpay. It was an enormous hassle moving coins to an approved wallet on my PC just for this one transaction. It actually bothered me so much I contacted the metals dealer and told them about the situation but they seemed aware of. Basically they said they had no other choice available to them because switching providers would be a hassle and they had to stick with with what they had. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:04:20
You could have sold at $18,000 and bought up twice as much of that tech you love so much today when it hit $9,000. Think about it. You'd have 2X the tech if you SODL and didn't HODL
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:15:32
I bet those that bought at $18k+ agree with him

As a protrader on localbitcoins I feel I can help answer one side of this question. 
My primary issue with bitquick has been the fact you cannot determine who you want to do business with and whether or not you want to share your banking details with that person. You also have no ability to determine whether or not a 3rd party is involved with a transaction. 
As a seller this is important to me because I need to be wary of man in the middle scams which are prevalent on cash deposit trades. Basically I need to be sure that the person making the deposit is aware of why they are making that deposit. 
With Localbitcoins I can chose whether or not I want to do the trade based on things like where the user is located or what their existing feedback is like but with bitquick you have none of that. So as an example a craigslist scammer can get your bank details. Have some schmuck deposit $2000 in your bank thinking he just got a great deal on a car. Bitquick thinks the receipt is good and you release your coins. Some scammer gets the coins and the victim gets a refund from your bank. The only one who loses is you the seller. Even Bitquick still makes their fees.
With Localbitcoins you have more options such as feedback and a functioning dispute process. You get none of that with bitquick.

So whose half did you just lose? Yours, hers or will you split those loss? Pretty smart if you just scammed yourself and screwed the old lady over. Pretty shitty if not.

Its a great alternative to Tether based exchanges or selling on localbitcoins. i got booted from coinbase for selling on localbitcoin so cashing out can be trickier. I sold most of my bitcoin over $11,000. I kept a few to see what would happen but its been all down hill and its getting worse. I sold a couple bitcoin for gold at $10,000 and I sold one more 
for $9000 in gold and silver last week. I'm thinking about selling the rest for gold an watching bitcoin tank. I agree with you and so does Charlie Lee. Its going to be a long bear market. I think it'll average $1500 for a year or so while the US gets its shit together and regulates crypto. We wont see a new ATH until 2020 when it finally breaks $20,000.
