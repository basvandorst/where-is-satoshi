It says in the HMRC document that crypto to crypto trades are considered so highly speculative that they are treated as gambling and not liable for CGT.
CGT is only applicable when trading from crypto to fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:48:45
“Whether any profit or gain is chargeable or any loss is allowable will be looked at on a case-by-case basis taking into account the specific facts. Each case will be considered on the basis of its own individual facts and circumstances. The relevant legislation and case law will be applied to determine the correct tax treatment. Therefore, depending on the facts, a transaction may be so highly speculative that it is not taxable or any losses relievable.. For example gambling or betting wins are not taxable and gambling losses cannot be offset against other taxable profits.”
I take the law as it is written. Trading bitcoin for shitcoins would be deemed highly speculative, in fact the entire crypto market is pure speculation at this point. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:54:15
There were too many miners mining bitcoin and as such the hashrate was high, blocks being found too quickly. The difficulty adjusted up to keep the block time the same.
With the difficulty now higher, miners decide it is more profitable to mine other coins. So there are now less miners available to mine bitcoin transactions, therefore the highest fees get mined first. 
Until the difficulty lowers, you may find there are longer waits on your transactions.

Bakkt may well use physical cards but I’m pretty certain they will use an app. 
Either they will go the route that Revolut has where you can expose yourself to crypto, but hopefully it will be the case that you can buy crypto from their exchange (with a nice UX like coinbase) and then spend directly using the app at accepted stores, like Starbucks.
So you get the exposure to the upward (and downward) movements of an investment but the ability to easily spend them at any time.
The only downside for the US is that I’m not sure if they have CGT allowance like we have in the UK. We can realise up to £11300 of capital gain without having to declare / pay tax so it makes for easy every day spending of crypto.

Of course it works **in theory**, just the same as saying “I can turn $1500 into $1,500,000 if I just make a 1000x trade”.
It’s possible, but not likely.
The probability of someone landing 69 perfect 10% trades is incredibly low, which is why I advise OP look into the variables a bit more.
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:02:43
Because a flash crash doesn’t always bounce back. Crypto moves fast enough to wipe out your first lot of 10% trades, even with a stop loss there’s no guarantee it will fill.
Trade 1 - $1500 - exit at 10% - $1650
Trade 2 - $1650 - exit at 10% - $1815
Trade 3 - $1815 - exit at 10% - $1996.5
Trade 4 - $1996.5 - market dumps 20% - $1662.5
Sell at loss on trade 
Trade 5 - $1662.5 - market dumps 15% - $1445.65
Now below your start price. 
It’s easy to do this method you speak of if you have a crystal ball and a bit of luck. The problem is, a lot of the time you will not see a 10% rise before seeing a relatively bad dump. 
Last year when everything was full bull, you may have had a better chance. 
The main issue arises when you get up to a decent amount of capital. On some low volume shitcoins you will suffer slippage and it will become harder and harder to take your 10%.

I had banked with them since I opened my first "adult" account when I was 16. 12 years later they kept issuing shitty chip and pin cards that broke all the time. I went through 4 cards in a about 6 weeks. 
They handled it really poorly so I just switched everything to Halifax. HSBC called me to ask why I was moving all my savings over and that I would lose interest. I told them I didn't give a fuck if it meant I didn't have to put up with their bullshit.

Ok, well you have nothing to worry about.
The only tax you would have to pay on crypto / bitcoin would be capital gains tax. 
If you are buying ten quids worth of bitcoin and then spending it immediately (or near enough) then chances are you will not have made a gain / loss on that ten pounds. So you will have no capital gains tax to pay.
You can also make £11700 tax free in the 2018-2019 year. 
Now if you are going to be “investing” ten pounds into some kind of scheme, where you will “earn bitcoin” ie: accrue more assets like an income, this will more likely be considered as viable for income tax.
Again, your own personal allowance for tax comes into play for income tax.

“There was a thread on the anandtech distributed computing forums posted some time ago when bitcoins were worth very little (.03 USD each iirc). Most of the replies were derogatory. Bitcoin is currently trading at 1.40 USD each. I posted a response (when bitcoins were trading at .80 USD each) suggesting that I wish I had known about it when some of the posters were making such comments. I was accused of "mining" the forums and not much has come from it since. 
I do wish I had known about bitcoin earlier. I'm hoping that I'm early enough to continue being profitable processing the transactions. It is extremely competitive. Those with lower electricity costs have the edge.”

Not necessarily, it would help of course as it means cost of mining would be reduced and make mining more accessible to individuals.

I’m not an American but I am in my early 30s. I am also married, 2 years and now have a 5 week old son.
We have a house, it’s a nice house but we plan to have a bigger one in time (plus keep this one to rent out).
If it was me, I would sell half of that 200 BTC. 100 BTC over here is about £580k at the mo. After taxes that is enough to pay off the remaining mortgage on our current house and buy outright our “bigger house”. 
Most likely would take a mortgage on the bigger house and buy another rental outright. Then would have a nice house to live in, plus two nice houses to rent out that cost nothing more than vacant rates and maintenance. 
I would not now be living a lavish lifestyle of lambos and Tesla’s, but I would now have the knowledge that my family is now pretty much set for life. 
Two rental properties bringing in steady money. Main house being paid for by rental money. Continue to work but have very little dependency on it.
Plus, still have 100 BTC left.

Nor can you infinitely divide bitcoin without invoking hard forks which in the end, ultimately divert away from the fundamentals of bitcoin.
You could deal in micrograms of gold (totally impractical) but it would be getting the users / market to agree to do so, much in the same way you would need to get a consensus to increase the decimal on 1 bitcoin.

1. Get "hacked"
2. Trade into Monero. Sell Monero.
3. ????
4. Profit.

“Oh I thought you meant the keys for this wallet, the one that contains 2 FUCK tokens. I lost those. I can’t give you any FUCKS. This wallet with 100 BTC in? That’s not mine, never seen it before.”

Haha, those are funny. The point I’m trying to make though is that crypto is very difficult to prove ownership of, unless it was purchased with fiat. 
If it was mined or gifted, then there is no chance of it being pinned as your possession. There are also many ways of getting around moving that money if needed.

I’d sell you mine but I need it.

I think the issue with Bitcoin.tax is that sometimes it magics BTC out of thin air. Don’t know why it happens. Just does. 
Drove me mad for months. In the end I just amended the amount to what it actually is and made a note.

Nothing to stop people reinvesting profits into new shares but same applies, its on the individual to set aside enough to pay the tax.

This is what I am thinking, the word must either start with er or end in er because teh chances of me deleting letters before and after are pretty slim

I generated the seed on  but I didn't write down the seed, hell I usually take photos / screenshot and I forgot to do that. 
I then selected groups of 6 words. Each line generated had 6 words in and I know I took 6 from each line I selected.
Because of this, the only word in my list that could be classed as incomplete is "er". And I know where it is supposed to be in the sequence. I believe it must either start with er or end in er. 
I have never used any brute force software so not sure how I would go about using one. You are right I could probably sit and go through them manually. I have tried short words so far, about 40. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:54:21
Yeah thanks bud I just opened it up myself and started tracing through the words. Turns out "er" is actually in the 2 letter word group. All of the words in my pass phrase are words in that list, so I don't really know what I have done wrong. I could have sworn yesterday I encrypted it, unlocked it, locked it again. 
Must have copied and pasted the wrong thing over and over, can't remember doing that though. Lesson learnt I guess.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:11:07
No my passphrase is made of varying letter words taken from the website I listed. This is all my own fault as it is most likely that whatever I copy and pasted into the encryption, I copy and pasted into the retype too... and whatever it is that i put in both, it isn't what I have saved in my note file. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:31:04
Looking into the site it says that the words are chosen from a dictionary of 27489 words. It says anyone can download the pages info and they assume that all of these words would be known. How could I go about finding this information? I imagine it would be pretty easy to narrow it down if I can find this out.

I bought in at $1200 but only a mere 0.4BTC. As the price has been dropping I've just being buying small chunks. I'm at 0.599 now and as soon as I get paid I am going to work my way up to  1BTC. I feel fairly confident it will go back up and hell if it doesn't oh well, it's just money. Don't invest / gamble what you can't afford to lose.
