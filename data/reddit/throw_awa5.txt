Barry is a vestige of an older generation, his youthful looks are deceiving. Similarly to Charlie Munger on gold, "civilized people" don't invest in Bitcoin so Barry treads with great care, often to his perceptual detriment here.

How are you working to make Bitcoin better? 
When the Nazis came for the communists,
I remained silent;
I was not a communist.
When they locked up the social democrats,
I remained silent;
I was not a social democrat.
When they came for the trade unionists,
I did not speak out;
I was not a trade unionist.
When they came for the Jews,
I remained silent;
I wasn't a Jew.
When they came for me,
there was no one left to speak out.

How about this for ethics: if you aren't working to make Bitcoin better (read: more private, more fungible, more scalable) than you should keep your dirty, groveling sycophant paws off of it. This is for the people, not some pretend-Sorcerers in their spiral towers convinced they are working with white magic when, in fact, they are just practicing voodoo. The fact that the stellar minds at MIT are even focused on developing AML/KYC initiatives is absolutely disgusting and will ultimately be to the detriment of MIT's reputation as an institution.

Internationalizing your business is a good first step but ultimately if the known benefactors only include yourself and you're acting as judge, jury, and executioner in corporate affairs, you're going to have a hard time escaping the realities of your physical jurisdiction.
