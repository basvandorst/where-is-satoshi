Coinbase.pro is the new option
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:29:24
What kind of commands are available?
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:22:05
Is that what was asked?
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:15:10
Absolutely 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:22:17
No one is really sending this guy anything are they??
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:52:17
You're delusional if you think this is going to stay unregulated forever. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:53:41
This is true. Without a programming background you simple do not have the tools needed to solve these problems. It's also kind of an insult to the hard work and time they have put into learning not only this technology, but programming as a whole. It's quite clear that he knows nothing about development or CS in general, so his opinion should, and does mean next to nothing.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:29:07
If it’s a secret to the person who actually has the opinion, you might want to take your tinfoil hat off. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:51:20
Well unless you want to land in prison, yea we kinda do. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:37:23
Social justice warriors. A large portion of our society who get off on playing victim.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:11:45
Yes you are locked in at the price you purchase. If price goes up, so does your value. Just have to wait a week to see it in your wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:19:49
If they’re weak hearted and don’t believe in the tech, they’ll sell. Anyone who does so deserves their losses.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:44:34
Didn't he just explicitly state that the lightning network will change that?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:11:26
Are you aware they lock you in at the price you pay at the time of the purchase. You’re not loosing any money unless you had planned on trading, which I don’t recommend if you want to keep your BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:26:30
More than you

This sub has turned into a pathetic collection of beggars. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:35:29
No, sell
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:22:47
To be fair, it was a dumb question.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:56:47
Sell it all! Crash is imminent 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:44:53
Yes, this is what I meant. You receive same amount you bought, the (USD) value of that amount may change during the waiting period. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:00:16
Not even 100. Are there honestly adults that believe today’s world is more racist/sexist/xenophobic than even 20 years ago? If so, were these people even alive then?  I understand equality and change for the better but anyone arguing that things are worse off now is just wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:12:56
Just... stop
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:25:09
No, quite the opposite 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:42:49
You should be fine. Give it a little more time. Keep contacting them on social media, and try to be as patient as you can. With such a high demand right now, you're not the only one dealing with this exact problem. They haven't stolen/lost your money, it's there. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:19:18
However large corporations don’t pay anything close to that and often times pay none at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:13:48
Many things are vulnerable to quantum computing. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:10:52
Yes, sell it all.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:08:21
Someone missed out.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:47:55
Yep, take the advice or pay the price in BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:00:19
I would start with lobbying for favorable crypto regulation. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:16:19
Better question. Why are you here?
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:19:41
Brilliant 
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:35:43
TA’s fake news bruh. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 12:45:56
@_date: 2018-05-16 23:16:27
And if you “need” the money now, then you likely needed it a week and a half ago when it was 10k and hadn’t seen a significant dip since it was at 6. No temptation to sell then, I’m sure.
@_date: 2018-05-16 23:44:06
Not gonna happen. Back up to ~9 where it will fluctuate mildly for a few months... I’m clairvoyant.
@_date: 2018-05-03 11:23:42
lol 20% huh?
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:07:21
These posts always crack me up. Panic selling at its finest.
@_date: 2018-05-01 20:34:56
Satoshi is God
@_date: 2018-05-16 17:52:58
“Bitcoin bagholder” lol right 
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:32:45
This sounds realistic. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 20:07:24
A computer program is dirty? Intelligent insight.
@_date: 2018-06-03 02:33:49
Very interesting...
@_date: 2019-02-26 12:39:28
@_date: 2019-02-02 21:09:59
No, neural networks are not “just a bunch of if/else statements”.
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:16:28
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:38:02
is there a reason you are so offended by BTC reaching the 10K mark?? Something tells me yes.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:33:10
Every previous “top” has been recovered within weeks of a crash. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:30:03
All customer support for exchanges are terrible. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:53:30
OH NOOOOOO!!! Downvotes!? I guess you’re right, very analogous to N Korea.
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:10:45

Make it eat it’s own microprocessor. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:22:21
Why are people posting four day old articles about the “current” price? I’m genuinely confused.
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:42:23
You’re definitely overreacting. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:26:56
This sub is an absolute wasteland. This is the third article referencing BTCs  “struggles”, that I’ve seen posted this morning. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 11:51:05
Probably the owners of said “centralized” databases. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:44:48
Do you not love that fact? I’m really confused by your oversensitivity.
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:23:47
How are these articles allowed to stay up while legitimate conversations are blocked?
@_date: 2018-07-26 11:22:38
Well this hasn’t gone as OP expected.
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:37:34
Wut?
