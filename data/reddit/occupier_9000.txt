There are relatively simple precautions that can be taken against this (and that cannot be feasibly worked around by the US government).

I'm not. The user above is *over*estimating them. If you were to use an open wifi connection in a major city on a used laptop you bought with cash, with TAILS or a similar live system, connected to a remote server that you gain control of and turn into a high anonymous proxy---there is positively *no way* for any adversary (even the NSA, FSB, MI6 or some other resourceful governmental entity) to locate you even in principle. The government is powerful; it is not omnipotent.

So, never.

I'm not a newspaper, cannot be sued for defamation, and am not entertaining the notion that thousands of people know the sting was faked (but nothing has leaked about). They have him dead to rights. Im not a part of and have no influence over his trial---so I have no reason to wait for a conviction to state the obvious. He totally did it.

It might have been cool for people to adopt this moniker and pass it along to each new site admin as they retired/got busted. Then Ulbricht went and tried to have someone tortured to death. Kinda ruined it.

Other than the evidence given to the public by the FBI, uh no. What's farcical is the idea that the hit put out on the blackmailer was made up. A theory that has no support.

At length he even reluctantly agreed to have the fake victim tortured to death.

Not that I'm defending Ulbricht for trying to have someone tortured to death, but no that wasn't actually permitted on the site along with credit card fraud and a few other things that violated his concept of the 'NAP'.

I made two separate orders today in the same amount. I think your system has confused them as being a duplicate order or something (moneygram had the same confusion until it was resolved) because I only had one Mtgox account funded and the other account remains empty. I verified using the receipt and reference number on the moneygram receipt that both orders were received by zipzap. I've left voice mails twice. I have the accout  they were sent to and here is the order number:
Can I get some communication here?

You're totally right. It was gumption and grit and entrepreneurial spirit. Ever since the day he was carved out of a piece of pinewood by a kindly old man named Geppetto; he was filled with the wit and will to succeed.
An American hero.

Of course it is. Warren Buffet is a lucky gambler.

You mean how Buffet's strategy is to commit to holding stock in order to advance the long term prospects for his bet? That doesn't mean it isn't simply gambling---he just has enough money to do this (and enough to influence the market) that this strategy is feasible for him. 


Of course I am---I'm parasitically manipulating money and contributing nothing to the economy in return. Unlike the Ayn Rand fanboys I hold no illusions about this. The money I'm making is not the reward for risk or merit or hard-work or lifting myself up by my bootstraps or any of that bullshit. This is all anyone who plays the stock market does. The sooner you realize that the better.

This has been resolved awhile ago thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-25 19:04:56
This order has been fixed already thanx
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:16:36
Yes. It was fixed this morning. Thanks
