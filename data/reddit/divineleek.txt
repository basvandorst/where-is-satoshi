Agreed also
I feel like these dates/numbers were picked randomly

Seed words are not helping, the sixth one in particular : that’s the word whose position is the least determined.
I’m still into my “something” (if you want to know -&gt; DM), I’m losing hope a bit

Take a look at his posts history...
@_date: 2018-09-03 18:17:18
That’s equivalent I guess, by symmetry
@_date: 2018-09-27 09:58:36
I tried the same, but considering the beta version as well.
You cannot get far with this, the entropy drop is truly low
@_date: 2018-08-15 19:29:06
What do you mean? 
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:48:55
I gave up on that a while ago
@_date: 2018-08-12 08:47:50
As expected, it is not easy
@_date: 2018-05-29 10:23:02
Anybody else made the first step? I'm stuck after it 
@_date: 2018-08-24 08:51:45
I have a way to break it, as long as the cipher verifies a few hypothesis, but I have to code the program, and I'm a bit too lazy for this (already made a few unsuccessful attempts...)
If it does not verify the hypothesis, then I'm almost clueless...

Blessed be the fruit.
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:43:46


Yes, and something that is undoubtedly right and part of the problem. I wanted to keep it for myself only, but I'm stuck again.
@_date: 2018-08-15 13:49:57
Okay I give up

If you extract every single color of the picture you'll notice that some letters are outlined by rarer color.
In RGB 212020 is a color that occurs exactly 6000 times in the pictures, in RGB, guess it is the meaning of clue 5. Another color appears 4000 times and highlight those same letters. Many color that occurs &lt;200 colors does the same. Color occurring &gt;200 (roughly), except three are due to resterization of small tilted words, and then 3 colors appear over a million times : the three main colors.
Note that rare colors happen only in the circle and at intersections with bitcoin logo, the pattern is pretty clear.
I will post extracted colors later if you're not convinced.
@_date: 2018-05-31 07:10:53
Some do. They make a mistake. I did not dream those letters, extract 212020
@_date: 2018-08-25 11:15:55
Nope, I didn’t even try yesterday (I was busy). I may try this afternoon
@_date: 2018-08-22 11:51:35
OP has replied only one comment, over a week ago
@_date: 2018-05-31 08:15:24
Yes. 00212121 is the clue, I think the leading zeros are there to tell us that this is color. It doesn't appear though, so I searched nearby colors, found it.
EDIT : 
Here you go, if you all human waste just lifted your ass from your chair you would have it already
@_date: 2018-05-29 13:29:51
Sure 
@_date: 2018-08-16 14:44:22
*ahem* Maybe is it time for a slight hint ? Something tiny enough to keep us focused, vague enough not to reset everyone's advance ?
@_date: 2018-08-15 20:09:35
Heh I gave up but not THAT much
(sorry :3)
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:13:57
I can assert : yes
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:11:14
I do not have much more that is SURE.
Guess nobody do
@_date: 2018-10-19 05:54:30
Ah, thanks :D
@_date: 2018-10-18 22:15:47
Fuck, I totally forgot 
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:50:26
How much money can a channel “operator” make ? (Ahem...)
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:15:19
Yep I know. Well it’s a good time to try to have a consensus, 150000 transactions are waiting
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:17:07
Mmhmhmh this, I hoped everyone would agree this
@_date: 2018-12-24 10:14:14
Jesus Christ, this community talks none stop about price

Bitcoin was meant to be a way of payment, not a some speculation value. This day was a bad day
