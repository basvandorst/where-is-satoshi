I agree that when bitcoin is regulated, the regulators will probably fuck it up royally. Let's be honest though: there are going to be some regulations. Not all regulation is bad. I think we would all like to see bitcoin somehow legally protected as an asset, so that when an exchange goes under, the exchange is liable for all the bitcoin they lose. Instead of this idealistic libertarianism, we should be pushing as hard as we can for the right regulation. We should be educating lawmakers about the right and wrong regulations. Nobody is going to listen to us if we're against *all* regulations, just like nobody listens to Ron Paul.

Fraud is only punishable because of regulation. It's not yet clear whether fraud involving bitcoin will be treated the same way as fraud involving fiat under current US criminal laws. Regulation could provide some kind of assurance that bitcoin will be treated the same way as any other currency when it comes to fraud.


No, I don't think the two are separate. A lack of regulations doesn't mean you can get away with *whatever* you want, but it mean you can get a way with more than you can compared to fiat. There's no precedent for bitcoin.

Old white men are a group of people who have it the best in society. They're senior, they're white, and they're men. Check, check, check. The joke is that this privileged class is out of touch with anything young and hip. The joke wouldn't work with any other class of people.
Recognizing that race exists and that certain races often have a better place in society is not racism. That's reality. This joke points out the reality of racial inequality. That's a good thing. That challenges the status quo and challenges racism.
The idea that people should go around pretending we're all the same now and that someone's race doesn't affect their place in society is silly. There is still racial inequality. Not talking about it doesn't do anything but make the situation worse. Whether someone is white or black *matters*. I don't like it either but denying that it's a problem would be even worse.

Mining is why Bitcoin currently uses a lot of electricity. Processing transactions is not the same as mining. Processing transactions doesn't actually *require* all this mining. The Bitcoin protocol forces miners to solve otherwise useless math problems (mining) in order to be *allowed* to process transactions. Mining is just a security measure to make it prohibitively expensive for someone to control the Bitcoin network.
If we had one million times the current number of users come on the network tomorrow, it wouldn't mean that the network would need to consume a million times more electricity.

I'd like to see you make your case in front of a panel of top VCs based on research you did on reddit.
"Look guys! 99% of people in a community of bitcoin enthusiasts think Amazon should accept bitcoin!"
Maybe you should learn to do proper market research instead of saying shit like "I just don't find it valid to hear them saying that amazon users don't really want a bitcoin pay-end though. I've personally scanned through this subreddit and found countless threads with users posting e-mails/suggestions sent to the team and Amazon to consider bitcoins". You do know that you're on r/bitcoin?
Amazon probably did their research and found that all their customers reuse passwords and can't be bothered with 2factor auth and that accepting bitcoin would just result in confusion for their customers.

I agree. Companies in the bitcoin space want and need regulation to protect and legitimize their businesses. The lack of regulation is keeping a lot of entrepreneurs from starting companies, because they're afraid of being shut down.
Unfortunately, you won't find any of that reasoning on reddit. You'll find lots of people supporting absolute libertarianism. Some here think bitcoin is immune to regulation because the bitcoin network can't be shut down. Others think that bitcoin can self-regulate through technology. These are all interesting ideas, but none of them are practical.
I think that the use of "regulation" as an umbrella term is the problem. There are two kinds of regulation: laws that will protect bitcoin businesses from legal threats, and laws that will subject bitcoin businesses to overbearing standards.
We need to be working on the kind of regulation that provides legal protections for bitcoin businesses. You can bet that the powers that be are working on the other kind of regulation behind closed doors. If we stand on the sidelines protesting all regulation, then we're going to get the kind of regulation that we fear.
Prepare to get downvoted. We're in the minority.

I still don't understand. Can someone explain further.
When I put something on my credit card, it might not clear for a month, but the store has my full name and address and can dispute it with the credit card company who accepts that liability. The reason I have a credit card is because a bank trusts me because I have a good credit history. If I go around doing fraudulent chargebacks then they can drop me.
If I walk into a store and pay with bitcoin and double spend, then the store is totally out of luck. There's no tracking me down and nothing to stop me from going into another store and doing it again.

Devil's advocate: At this stage bitcoin really isn't for the average joe. If you don't understand security then you really shouldn't be holding much bitcoin. Coinbase is giving the average joe a false sense of security. Average joe might not realize that he needs to have a malware-free computer and a secure password and 2FA etc or he might lose all his coins with no recourse. So if bitcoin is not average joe friendly then who is Coinbase for? Nobody. Coinbase should make a product for geeks instead like blockchain is doing. When there are reliable hardware wallets secure enough for the average joe, then they can start in on that segment of the market.

An idealistic libertarian would be completely (because they're idealistic) against regulation (because they're libertarian.) I don't see anything wrong with being libertarian, but I'm worried that people are too idealistic.
For example, if there were explicit regulations stating how a bitcoin exchange must be operated, then entrepreneurs wouldn't have to be terrified of getting arrested for opening an exchange in the US.
I recognize that if the regulations are too complicated, then no entrepreneur will be able to afford the lawyers needed to comply and they won't open that exchange anyway. That's why we should be pushing for *smart* regulation, so entrepreneurs have the protection of the law without it being overbearing.
If we just stand on the sidelines protesting any regulation, while the regulators write the regulations, then we're going to get the *stupid* regulation we fear.

Speculators and people who want to see bitcoin as a payment system are one and the same. That's what they're speculating on. If the speculators go away, then it only means less confidence in bitcoin as a payment system.

Edit: It's not a threat. It's an example to show that in the right circumstances, OP would ask for help in his violent fight too. OP admits that he knows nothing about the conflict in the region, yet still won't help if it means contributing to violence. That's absolute pacifism, and it's a nonsensical philosophy. An absolute pacifist wouldn't give their buddy a baseball bat so that their buddy could defend themselves, because that would be contributing to violence. An absolute pacifist would also not donate money to defeat Hitler, because that too would be contributing to violence.

It sound pretty trivial to pull off currently. Step one: send bitcoin to merchant with a small (or no) miners fee. Step two: immediately send bitcoin to yourself with a large miners fee. Couldn't someone make an app to do this all for you or is there more to it?
How does Coinbase or Bitpay detect that? Correct me if I'm wrong: transactions propagate to every node on the bitcoin network in a few seconds, but then take until a new block is mined to be confirmed. So is Bitpay able to monitor the nodes and make sure no other transactions have propagated?
I guess I see how it could be fixed, but right now it still looks like a problem.

This is clearly iDrive just trying to get some press and ride the popularity of bitcoin.

The article explains this obvious fact as though the folks at iDrive discovered it. Then the article goes on to tell you all about iDrive's services.
I'm sure the folks at iDrive were hoping this article would lead to some brand awareness and interest from a technical and influential demographic.

Well... Think about it... What's harder to brute-force? A long string of random characters isn't going to get brute-forced. If your brain wallet is a few words from a dictionary then that's pretty easy. If it's 10 truly random words from a dictionary then it's harder. Random strings from books are easier because they can be pulled from books and searched for and also because they are not randomly constructed.
The quality of a brain wallet depends on how much you can memorize and how random it all is.

Not really. The price of bitcoin is down on the news. It was better for bitcoin when people thought that the creator was some superhuman group of cryptography geniuses operating under a pseudonym. Peoples's imaginations could run wild imagining Satoshi as some infallible messiah-like genius. If people know that he's just a regular guy then they'll see bitcoin as weaker. It isn't actually weaker, it's the same bitcoin, but the reality of Satoshi can't compete with the mythology of Satoshi. People can now start attacking the creator and pointing out his weaknesses in a way that they couldn't with the mythological Satoshi.

I said that old white men are the most privileged people on earth. You can't possibly disagree with that.

Yes. It actually is safe to assume that a white male has had it better than a minority or female. You can find examples to the contrary, but we're talking about demographics. Old white guys represent the most privileged demographic.


Nobody said that. I said it's clever comedy to point out that the most privileged class (old white men) wouldn't be accepting of technology that challenges the status quo.

I'm starting to doubt this story more now. If Satoshi knew she was coming, then he had time to make a plan. If he didn't want to reveal himself, he could have just told her she had the wrong guy. If he did want to reveal himself, then I imagine that someone of his intelligence would have prepared a more definitive and intelligent statement.
If I were the real Satoshi and a reporter was on her way to my house, I would just politely deny involvement. Calling the police and giving these ambiguous statements sounds like what a confused recluse would do, not a genius.

It's *important* that we make jokes about how old white men are out of touch. We can't just sweep it under the rug an pretend that white men didn't have more opportunities than other demographics.


Racial inequality was the problem I was talking about. What I said was: "There is still racial inequality. Not talking about it doesn't do anything but make the situation worse. Whether someone is white or black *matters*. I don't like it either but denying that it's a problem would be even worse."

I'll bite...


Explain to me how Venezuelan politics are analogous to American politics given the difference in the types of government and culture.


Equally true statement: Plenty of rational, intelligent people listened to Ron Paul. And they came to different conclusions than he did.


Explain to me how you can shoehorn someone into a dialectic. Am I shoehorning people into the Hegelian Dialectic, or bitcoin into the Hegelian Dialectic? Explain to why the Hegelian Dialectic doesn't make sense to use given that we are talking about regulation vs. no regulation.


We agree on this point.
