But they provide a service for that 2-3 percent. When I dropped my iPhone and broke the screen within the first month or two, American Express covered the repair. When someone charged something to my card in some other state, chase called me, removed it from my account and sent me a new card. From the merchant standpoint, so many people have cards (many are lines of credit) and would rather use cards than cash or checks, so the merchant has to accept them or risk losing a lot of sales. In fact, when a customer pays with cash or check, the store has to secure the cash and have them taken by person or security company to the bank to be deposited, adding a cost. That's not counting the labor cost of handling the cash at the point of sale. All of this is a cost. Card transactions appear directly in their bank account.  
I understand Bitcoin does not suffer from some of these problems, but it does have its own- exchange rates, cost to convert to/from fiat, confirmation time, relatively steep learning curve, dependent upon devices (to some extent) and network connections, etc.
@_date: 2015-12-04 18:09:57
First, you are receiving services- as you yourself said, you don't have the option of accepting cash or checks. You do, but it's not really feasible when compared to instant payments through card companies that take a small fee, and you'd have no customers that are willing to give you 3-5% more revenue by making it inconvenient to pay you. 
Those services the cardholder receive drive cardholder adoption. It's clear by merchants would prefer bitcoin, but where is the incentive for a purchaser? They have to spend money to convert it, they have to spend money to send it, it's more complicated to use, they have no protections or recourse in the event of a dispute, and a mistake can cause them to lose everything they have. It seems like the bitcoin fails to align incentives with the purchasers who have the leverage. In fact the only incentive I've seen that really drives bitcoin adoption from the purchaser side is to offer discounts to those that use bitcoin- which means you are no better off than if you had paid a card processor a small fee.
My anecdotal example: I purchased a piece of furniture from overstock using Bitcoin to support their acceptance of it. They shipped me the wrong item. Rather than correcting their mistake by shipping me the new piece while waiting for the wrong piece to be returned, they made me return the wrong item first. Then I had to wait for them to process it. This took a couple of followups. Then I had to wait for them to ship the correct piece. It was 6 weeks between the time that I made the purchase and the time that I actually received the correct item. Yes, this may deal with Overstock's policies when using Bitcoin, but they have those policies because they could not place a hold on my bitcoins to force me to return their mistake, and I could not dispute the transaction for which I did not receive what I purchased. Had I used a credit card, they would have reshipped immediately and waited patiently for my return knowing they could charge the card for the wrong item should I not return it. This means that next time I make a purchase from them, I'm going to use my credit card.

They can absolutely coexist. What they offer is different enough. It's not that merchants would want to pass it up, but they also won't implement it without demand. Infrastructure and training is a non-zero cost, and those relatively fixed costs have to be worth the cost savings over time before they'll start accepting bitcoin. I suspect this is why we're seeing it accepted by small merchants and websites with a central shopping cart (using a 3rd party service that charges a fee to the merchant). 
Don't forget- credit card companies offer more benefit to the consumer. Which encourages consumers to use it. And that drives demand for merchants to accept it.

You're saying that deflationary currency would put pressure on companies to make more durable products that they can sell for more money. This same currency would put pressure on consumers to buy cheaper products to save more of their value-building money on hand. For the most part, companies build what customers want, not the other way around. Even Apple, a company that has long tried to go the other way, has been forced to cave to market pressure and release large screen iPhones after their long-standing stance that 3.5" is the perfect size for the human hand.


Give me one source for this. There is one bulb known to man that has lasted this long and it is the exception. Also note that companies are building longer and longer lasting light bulbs. (incandescent &gt; CFL &gt; LED)


They do, but you have to spend more than $40 on your printer. How much did the one you bought in the 90s cost, when adjusted for inflation? Again, companies figured out that cutting costs would get more customers, and they cut the quality to get those low costs (along with print cartridges). An example of a high quality, high priced alternative, Brother laser printers are known for longevity- not a single one in our office has failed, and the longest lasting one has printed over 70k pages and shows no signs of failing. Check out their reviews on Amazon (HL-2270DW is a current model). 


Not sure what that has to do with this discussion, but companies do this because customers shopping for inexpensive solutions prefer things to be dead simple. Again higher-end stuff works differently as it aims for a different market.


Money already is valuable and thus customers demand **value** for their money. That's why most are okay with buying inexpensive, lower-quality stuff that lasts long enough for them to get the use they feel was worthwhile out of it.

Generally speaking, the buyer can place the chargeback with their card, and they will take the money from PayPal. PayPal will take it from you while they research. PayPal can find in your favor and work towards getting the money from the card issuer, but if the buyer said it was unauthorized, you're pretty much SOL.

Oh I can definitely see why they did it, but from the customer point of view, the merchant screwed up and the customer is "suffering" for it, simply because the customer used a payment method that benefits the merchant more than the customer.
Merchants that accept Bitcoin will need to think things like this through and come up with a better solution.

Fair point, but note that it's not the only thing that bitcoin has to offer. Bitcoin will never be successful in a raw state, nor do I think it was meant to be. It's far too technical for the average user. However, you can layer things on top of bitcoin to make it easy to use, to the point that the average joe doesn't need to know about the blockchain and change addresses and such and still use it.

It has to do with Bitcoin because it's Overstock's policy when the buyer uses Bitcoin (but not other payment methods), I assume to mitigate fraud. 
It's just one of those issues that merchants are going to have to work through, like how to set up recurring payments with bitcoin.

Back in college, I underestimated my expenses, and had ordered food at a restaurant but didn't have enough to pay for it. I called my dad who, from his house far away, transferred money via PayPal to me. I then used my paypal debit card to pay for my meal. 
Since he transferred via bank account, there was no fee involved, and I even got a very small amount back from using my PP card. So yes, you can send and instantly use money via PayPal if you have their linked debit card, and you can use it anywhere that takes MasterCard. You can even withdraw it from an ATM, though it does charge a fee.
Absolutely no idea why you're being downvoted. Bitcoin is great, but that doesn't mean some existing solutions don't work for some things.

While I wish that was the case, the majority of people would rather pay with credit, hold their money in a place they are less likely to lose, receive some sort of protection, and incur zero fees.
Merchants would rather people pay in bitcoin because they have no risk of chargeback and no fees. They are in good position to drive adoption, as they can offer discounts that give consumers incentive to try something new.
Bitcoin does not need to be the solution for every problem for it to be successful.

I have no idea why people keep having trouble understanding this, and worse, try to suppress the thought by downvoting. Credit cards offer more benefit to consumers, period. That's a big part of the fee they charge to merchants. Merchants receive more benefits from bitcoin and sometimes they incentivize consumers by passing along a portion of the savings.
Merchant acceptance helps grow bitcoin, but that's not where it will make its biggest mark.

Accepting a dollar via PayPal will often net you less than a dollar.
They are trying to raise awareness of Bitcoin by tipping. If they can get a hospital to start accepting it as payment, then there is no need for recipients of donations to need to go through an exchange first.

I know price and quality is not a one for one correlation, but products tend to fail faster than others because they used lower quality materials, cheaper manufacturing methods, less quality assurance, and less research and development. These things all play a part in price. What companies have discovered is that the average consumer would rather pay $5 for a product that lasts 5 years than $10 for a product that last 20. 
Also, your premise that companies purposely build products to fail is flawed. Companies would rather have a second customer than the same customer twice, as there are great advantages to controlling a market. They don't get that by purposely making products that will fail after a specified amount of time. Even if a failing product was their goal, using lower quality materials achieves this goal while also saving money. Yes, there are companies that practice this form of planned obsolescence, but they pretty much have to control their market for it to work, so it's not that common. Doing so risks a competitor edging in, which self corrects the attempted reduction in quality. For an example, look at how popular Japanese cars are nowadays after American car companies cut costs.

Better durability means higher costs. Many companies that go this route are punished by customers buying a cheaper product instead.
In fact, if Bitcoin gains money in your pocket, customers would be encouraged to buy the product that only lasts 5 years instead of 10, assuming the cost is much lower, in order to save that money.

First, you need to understand what it means to be mainstream. It can be mainstream without everyone knowing what it is or how to use it in its current form. 
We're not entirely sure what or how it will be mainstream. It will almost certainly need layers that make it easy for a specific market to use. If you can figure out what layer will do it, you should be building it, because that's a huge opportunity right now.
Perhaps it becomes popular in as a hedge against inflation in third world countries, but is largely ignored in first world countries.
Perhaps banks will use it to store value and make it easy to transfer said value internationally. That way, the end users (bank customers) as still using local fiat, but the banks are all using bitcoin behind the scene.
Perhaps a growing mistrust of government and inflation causes first-world citizens to seek out new ways of storing their wealth. Layers like Coinbase can make it feel more similar to a traditional bank. 
Perhaps merchants will continue to add it as a payment option at POS with discounts to customers that use it, due to the benefits a merchant receives. 
More than likely, it will be a combination of a few things, perhaps some that we haven't thought of yet.

I have purchased a number of things from overstock over the years and a couple of things from Overstock with Bitcoin recently. Never again.
I ordered four chairs on 8/31. They sent the wrong chairs. I contacted them immediately, returned them immediately, and then had a follow up a week later to figure out why I didn't have the correct chairs yet. Since I had paid with Bitcoin specifically, they waited for me to return their mistake first, then wanted to wait a week for them to process it, then a couple more days to ship them. After a couple of more weeks with no word, I had to contact them again to figure out why they still hadn't shipped. Anyway they finally shipped this week and the chairs are being delivered today (Saturday). It better be the right chairs this time. 
Anyway, my next order from them, if I order from them again, will be with a credit card. They can eat the fees and I'll have some protection from their bullshit.

I don't necessarily agree with your premise. As I said before, there is no reason they cannot work side by side, or even together. However, if they do forfeit market share, so be it. I have no personal stake in VISA. 
I'm sure they see it as a possible threat, but they could also be looking at it as an opportunity. Bitcoin is still very young and (currently) has a small fraction of the market share and name recognition as VISA. It's as likely that Bitcoin is a flash in the pan as it is that it will change the world. Obviously I'm hoping for the latter.

I do agree with that- they are ripe for disruption. 
On the other hand, merchants are free to not accept credit cards. They do so because people want to use them. People want to use them because they are convenient, provide a layer of protection, allow them to purchase easily on credit, and give consumers rewards. Bitcoin has it's own benefits, but doesn't do all of these. Merchants will have to find a way to incentivize consumers or else they have very little reason to use bitcoin (in this capacity) rather than their existing credit/debit cards. For instance, thanks to a bad experience using bitcoin with Overstock, I will certainly be sticking with purchasing from them using a credit card.

I'm responding to your edit that says half of global wealth held by the 1%.
To clarify, they made headlines last year saying that the 85 richest people have the same wealth as the poorest 50%. Now they are saying that the top 1% will have more than the other 99% by 2016. They are not saying that 85 people = 1% of the worlds population. 1% of the world's population is over 7 million people. It's not difficult to get to the top 1% if you are in the US.
Edit: I am not saying that income disparity is good. Just trying to add perspective when they use numbers like this.

Just a note on that, if you make more than ~$34,000 a year, you are in the top 1% globally. We are not talking just about billionaires here.

Ah very true. It's interesting that it takes so relatively little income to be in the top 1% of earners, but so much equity to reach the same position. It makes sense to measure both ways and consider both, because it only takes $3650 in assets to reach the top half. Many medical doctors have negative equity for long time, but they certainly do not live like the bottom half of the worth.
