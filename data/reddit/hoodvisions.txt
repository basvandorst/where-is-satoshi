You could send all your coins to software wallet(s) and only leave a small amount on the hardware wallet for wiping and recovering. If it works and your balance is still there send your coins back to your HW wallet.

You didn't read or I expressed it falsely. This is exactly what I am talking about. People are hoping to get the maximum profit and will refrain from selling (too early). Everyone is infected by that millionaire fever even when they only spend a 100 squid... It's become a pure lottery where you just have to keep playing.

Exactly! I'm in for a profit to buy a smartphone or something, which is great, yes. Not complaining. But considering all that hype lately as well as how crypto made loads of people millionaires with a comparable small investment the thought about selling is haunting me. If I could afford a small house or part of it (500k over here "close" to Berlin) I would totally cash out and never look back again! Right now I just hope it will become a nice vacation or maybe even the initial fees for a mortgage...

Website down and for sale. And according to the forum entries of this coin the pump and dumps already managed to ruin a few people's "investments". So, obviously a shitcoin.

Maybe it was a legal, regular transaction, but due to low fee settings they decided to take him hostage after a couple of days looking at the unconfirmed transaction still...

I would totally love if you could donate to some the really "small ones"...For years I pumped money into companies like WWF, Peta (yeah, I know!) etc. but eventually stumbled upon a woman saving and neutering dogs in egypt as well as a small team of people saving and neutering cats - they all spend their private time and effort on doing something good. I cannot imagine the impact of donations in the thousandsomething-area on these people.

Yeah, well...so I thought this is a bargain and went to coinbase as it's my only account where I can **quickly** ( &lt; 3 days) buy BTC via credit card. +$20 fees for buying and to send it to my wallet another $20...wow.

I hope they tested their recovery via seed process first.

In fact I did exactly this yesterday and stumbled over 700 USD worth of Bitcoin! Guess I bought them for porn or whatever back in 2015 and the small change happens to be worth a high-end graphics card today. However, I'm gonna hodl in my trezor!

Okay, thanks a lot. Guess I'll be moving my coins to coinbase and hold for a week or two. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:02:09
Would you mind emphasizing on why this would be your choice? Thanks

There's really a dream coming true here for him/her. Whenever I phantasized about becoming super rich I always felt like donating to all kinds of charities and specifically the small unknown ones would be the best and most sensible thing to do. And when listening around I feel like most people actually share this "plan". 56 million, just WOW!!

Wow, what a piece of BS. The part that finally convinced me this is just a pile of SEO relevant keywords is:


Good luck with that, lol!
