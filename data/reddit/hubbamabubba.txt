When people talk about ram prices they're talking about DDR4, not VRAM. Miners have very little effect on that compared to say smartphones. DDR4 isn't selling out instantly on Newegg like GPUs are.

Ram prices haven't really changed in the last month, therefore miners aren't having a large effect on its price.

I personally prefer high fees.

Even though that was an Ethereum reference?

They also have a lot of random tech stuff like GPUs, laptops, etc.

RAM has nothing to do with mining.

Mining rigs are capable of running 13+ GPUs each, with each rig requiring 4GB of ram. That means that it takes at least 52 GPUs in mining rigs to match the ram used in a decent gaming computer.

All in AMD!

They pay a lot less tax than you do.

They're not really related, its just that you don't really control your coins if they're in someone else's wallet.

We're you using it on and off? That doesn't seem like very much.

They have the same build quality at least.

They don't let you change default apps, which is forcing you to use them to some extent.

No in saying that if you install a third party browser, but open a link from a text message you'll get sent to Safari. 
If you have the YouTube app and open a video link you'll automatically be sent to the app. 
You think Google doesn't have your info? If you have an account and use it, it doesn't matter what platform you're on.
@_date: 2016-02-18 12:45:58
You still end up using Safari when another app opens your browser though. Also, if you have a YouTube app you're stuck always opening the app when you want to watch a video, you don't have a choice.
Play services isn't a necessary part of Android.

Newegg.com has accepted it for a long time, .ca hasn't.

Maybe not, demand from miners isn't that high right now. Supply is just really low as production of Pascal has siezed.

This is 2017, 6 year olds don't go to candy stores on their own. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:33:39
Demand isn't normally very high at this time of year. What would typically happen before a new release is a bunch of sales as the stores try really hard to clear stock of the old gen before nobody wants them.
