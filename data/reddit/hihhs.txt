Do you like the initial decrease in block size to 300KB from Luke's proposal?
@_date: 2017-02-03 20:20:26
But 30 seconds is not the average propogation delay

Did you get the time to read their paper? How do you feel about a 1 min block interval?
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:09:55
SegWit is nice, and it's a shame that it is not being activate. But what do you think about the subject discussed in this paper? Do you disagree with their conclusion that having a block interval of 1 min does not compromise security?

Do you mean with current knowledge, or ever? In your opinio'n what is the max throughput that can be achieved on-chain? Is there a known upperbound?

Thank you for the detailed answer, this is interesting. I understand that we cannot find the optimal parameters, but why not improve them to the best values that do not impact security?

Yes I know these stats but I don't think we can deduce the stale rate from them. According to what I see in the paper the stale rate wouldn't increase significantly with 1min blocks. What do you think about their results?

It's true I don't see any big changes getting consensus in Bitcoin anytime soon. The community may have to split.

hi again, did you get a chance to?
@_date: 2017-02-03 20:51:48
Are there downsides?
@_date: 2017-02-04 09:21:41
 column t_mbp in Table 7, am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-02-03 21:15:25
why does the block propagation time decreases when the block interval decreases?
@_date: 2017-02-03 13:45:30
I agree with your point but I don't think your math is correct. Why do you conclude that 95% visibility in 30s imply 5% stale rate?
@_date: 2017-02-03 14:55:13
This research paper is quite new, I haven't seen it discussed here.
@_date: 2017-02-10 11:28:35
If I understand, Table 7 changes the block size as well, right?
In the link you provide, I checked 1 MB and 1 minute, and t_median is 544.198 s. That's not good at all is it? Why does the paper conclude (in Table 9) that 1 MB/1 min is secure enough, despite the fact that t_median gets very high?

Wouldn't you say 0.14 takes 33% less time than 0.13.2 to sync?
Edit: Questioning my sanity as well
@_date: 2017-03-06 10:34:36
But it's a decrease, not an increase. If you go from 0.14 to 0.13.2 then yes it's a 49% increase in time. In the other direction it's a 33% decrease
@_date: 2017-03-06 07:24:32
Nice! but this is 33% faster
@_date: 2017-03-06 14:32:54
Ok I think I got it. "faster" describes blocks/time unit while "less time" describes overall time. You were right
@_date: 2017-03-06 12:20:38
I got this, but shouldn't we say: 0.14 is 33% faster than 0.13.2, and 0.13.2 is 49% slower than 0.14?

what's the best alternative for cold storage?
@_date: 2016-10-20 07:11:50
This would have to be included in the consensus protocol. Then they would mine blocks with just one transaction. Where do you draw the limit?
