By talking to everyone you know about bitcoin, you kind of invite this.
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:00:00
And they most certainly use more electricity than all BTC mining.

~~bitcoin~~ r/bitcoin is moving towards a religious mentality instead an actual discussion on technology.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:34:04
Wrong question. Some of us still focus on the tech. But the number of people who only focus on the price has increased.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:45:54
What an absolute whiny little entitled piece of shit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:21:01

Well there might be 111,114 BTC for sale soon.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:03:39
Both subs are a joke.
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:56:52
Why do you care what people online think?
@_date: 2018-08-13 04:09:25
their loss
@_date: 2018-08-13 04:12:42
Thanks for your prediction!
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:06:20
Hasn't that been the point all along?
@_date: 2018-08-14 00:54:29
Well someone woke up grumpy.
@_date: 2018-10-25 07:42:43
It will, be patient.

Far from it. While this is certainly good news, the tax system on crypto profits is horrible. They are taxed as miscellaneous income, rather than capital gains, which means they just stack on top of your regular income and you end up paying 40% or more on your crypto profits.
What Japan really needs to do is set a flat tax rate like they did on Forex (20%). 20% isn't great but it's a LOT better than 40%+.

Fuck that tyrant.

Why do Bcash people say "bro" all the time?
@_date: 2019-04-07 12:26:44
When they first started they required BitFlyer and there was a limit of 100,000 yen. I didn't realize they had changed their policies, that's good to hear... might actually try it now.
Now all we need is Japan to change their tax system for crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:36:23
1000 is the new 100
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:47:12
That's the one I see when I'm trying to fall asleep.
@_date: 2019-04-07 12:15:18
But you are forced to use BitFlyer right?
@_date: 2019-04-02 01:38:18
Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
@_date: 2019-04-02 08:14:18
I agree. I just don't trust people who are absolutely certain. I was certain that Trump wouldn't become president and now look at me.

The Amazon of Japan is Amazon. Rakuten is the Rakuten of Japan.
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:28:33
And abandon virtually ALL of their customers? No.
@_date: 2019-01-20 13:04:33
"looks" artificial? It WAS artificial.

The smell of my fart this morning suggests price bounce may be coming.
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:48:04
~~If~~ When
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:34:34
Japan here, just woke up. Pleased.
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:54:10
Except for the whole tax thing.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:12:18
Market cap $54,183 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:14:41
The market cap was around $250,000 at it's peak.
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:34:03
Same way I remember my passwords. Lastpass.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:53:45
And did they pay for it?
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:10:12
And who made Stranger Things?
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:33:35
Only because he lost $100k.
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:58:37
That's why you don't talk to your family about Bitcoin.
