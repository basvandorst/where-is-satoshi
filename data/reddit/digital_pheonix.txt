Its hardly a rescue when the price of BTC is drastically declining.
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:34:37


Actually its on its way down -

Why would bitcoin replace the dollar?

I'm not sure where you get this from. 
As mentioned with the Nikkie example, many people have waited decades, and are still waiting, just to get back to break even. In that same time, other investors cut their loses and invested in more profitable investment schemes.

Because it may take decades for you to get back to break even, similar to the Nikkei. If you had invested in the Nikkei back in 1998 you would still be waiting to get back to break even. Thats 20 years of wasted investment opportunity. Most financial advisors recommend that you cut your loses quickly - on any losing investment - and move to something more promising.

Nixon's last day in office was January 20, 1961. And the US economy is still, generally, very strong.
@_date: 2019-11-14 03:46:01
Very cool. Can you make the price go up?
@_date: 2019-11-22 01:28:31
Especially for those who sold. They can even buy something useful.

BS. Article is about derivatives and is nothing to do with BTC. 
Dont give them your clicks!
@_date: 2019-11-21 22:32:04


This is utter BS! Please stop spreading this nonsense! People on this subreddit are gullible and will likely start believing it.

You have a scheduled bank run? What country is this happening in?

The repo payments are repaid each day. The Fed isnt printing an additional 100b each day for repo. And repo payments isnt the best indicator of the strength or weakness of an economy.
@_date: 2019-11-12 21:39:03


Actually this isnt true - 
@_date: 2019-11-13 01:14:56


Basically, yes. Although QE did end, at least temporarily. 


They did QE.
@_date: 2019-11-12 22:10:39


I think this is the most important point.
In previous recessions, namely '08, quantitative easing actually worked, and was well managed. However, with low, or negative interest rates, QE almost certainly will not work in the current economic climate.

Ah, no. Retail traders trade everything they can, especially stocks, commodities, indices, bonds and forex.
@_date: 2019-11-22 00:35:37


Ok, yes. 
We just need to be remember that Bitcoin has been around for 10 years - which is a fantastic achievement. But its not long enough to be sure that the trends will consistently repeat.

Someone didnt read the article.
@_date: 2019-11-26 01:25:08
Use which ever language youre most comfortable and competent in. 
Asking the internet will not help.
@_date: 2019-08-22 02:10:19


How does one do that?
@_date: 2019-12-05 21:13:10
I'd take the Truck!
@_date: 2019-09-30 03:57:56
Ok, this makes sense.
@_date: 2019-09-30 03:15:35
Hmmm, I see.


Yes this is what I also expect. But the docs say:


I think I need to do some testing.
@_date: 2019-09-30 03:40:08


Ok, thanks
@_date: 2019-09-30 02:45:34
Ok thanks.
So, to clarify, if I use GPG / openGPG, for example `gpg -c wallet.dat`, then I can use this encrypted file - `wallet.dat.gpg` - in the wallet?
Will I still be able call `getbalance` without needing to decrypt the `wallet.dat.gpg` file?
@_date: 2019-09-30 03:06:22
Yes I understand the file will be gibberish.
However, when I read  and  I get the impression that I can still use some functions, but various functions such as `sendtoaddress` will require the decyption passphrase. 
So, I'm trying to understand if the wallet will know to decrypt the `wallet.dat.gpg` file, or if I need to renaming the encrypted to be `wallet.dat`.
And also trying to understand, what, if any, functions will work while the `wallet.dat` is still encrypted.
