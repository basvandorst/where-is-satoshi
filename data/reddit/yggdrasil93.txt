Just dropped $1000 into BTC and then not 5 minutes later get the alert about China imposing tariffs. Beautiful timing. To the moon!

BTC and gold... We already can “make” gold in labs it’s just cost prohibitive (which can and probably will change with technological advancement). No more BTC will be made. 
I remember when my grandparents died we found tens of thousands of dollars in cash and coins stuffed all over their house. They lived through the depression and did not trust banks at all. They didn’t even use credit cards. 
Have a feeling our grandkids will experience the same but with finding our bitcoin wallets lol.

You shouldn’t be investing anything at all until your responsibilities are taken care of. 
This is how you end up living in a cardboard box under a bridge...

Tbh if we see another 2008 level global meltdown BTC @ $20k USD that everyone was geeking out over could look like nothing. Sky is the limit.

Yes BTC exists completely in its own little bubble. It’s own little plane of existence completely unattached to the realities of global economics and finance. There are no institutional investors into BTC just like how the IRS isn’t getting involved in it (they are) and the Feds haven’t confiscated BTC as assets (they have). 
Are you for real?

Lol not me. I haven’t been in crypto for like 2 years and just jumped in and bought $1000 worth of BTC. Everyone’s talking recession and worried about the Fed... If shit hits the fan I like my chances with BTC over any stock.

I do not understand bears at all. The underlying fundamentals have not changed. People need to learn how to read basic Candle charts. Far greater resistance to downturns than upturns if you’re looking at a bigger picture than hour by hour with BTC. 
If the global economy goes into recession BTC @ 20k USD could look like child’s play. I am not just into BTC and I treat it just like everything else I trade. I intend to hold over a longer term because I like the fundamentals. Time in market &gt; timing the market.

My theory is that 90% of “Bears” are actually long BTC and just troll to try and encourage panic selling so they can swoop in and buy.

2% dip in about 20 minutes. Maybe I’m out of the loop but what’s going on? People just shorting through Bakkt?

I would be too but all of my cash is tied up in my side business. I’ve thought about pulling out all I can but then I can’t really do any work on my current business project which would make me sad.

What do you guys use to track the price(s) of Bitcoin (and other crypto) live? Any good websites or whatever that are free/open source?
I don't want this for trading purposes but for my business. Just to have essentially a live ticker of current exchange rates vs the USD displayed. So I'm concerned about legal issues.
Sorry if this is a newb question...

Yep. Wasn’t repealed until Ford. Dec. 31st 1974.... Part of the reason the 1933 double eagle $20 gold coin is one of the most valuable coins ever. There were like 400,000 minted but I think there are only like a dozen known to have survived and not melted down.
Also the similar EO 6814 signed on August 9, 1934 that was for silver. That was a bit more lax though. 
Even foreign banks that had gold stored in the US had it confiscated and their only option was restitution in paper currency. I think Australia did something similar in the 50’s as well. There might be examples from other countries I’m not aware of. 
Just saying but all it takes is more pushing of the “crypto = safe haven for terrorists and criminals” narrative that’s been pushed more by governments lately and some arguments that bans are necessary to “ensure national security and national sovereignty over currency”.... Boomers are ignorant and gullible they won’t care and younger people don’t even vote. 
They may not be able to outright get at our wallets but they can make it illegal to hold or use it and make examples out of a few poor bastards with fines + prison along with instructing ISPs to report any related activity. 
Not even sure what could be done at that point.

No I was just born in 93. 
Thanks for the link though it looks interesting. I'll have to do some research and then reach out to them and see if they'd be cool with what I have in mind.

You’re not wrong.

Anyone else concerned about France and the Libra debacle? I don’t care about Libra and fuck Facebook but the language of the French govt. is concerning. They keep talking about “public crypto”. Ignoring that the current state of BTC is about as “public” as it gets. Also mentioned that they have projects in the works towards that end. 
Reading between the lines it sounds like they’re going for state controlled crypto (if it can still be called “crypto”currency at that point). Has me very worried as I foresee other governments jumping on that train. Wouldn’t be unthinkable to see a ban on BTC. Maybe I’m overreacting but when you start talking about these sorts of broad economic issues and what BTC can represent (true freedom from central bank controlled fiat currency)... Wars have been fought over less in the past. Wouldn’t be unthinkable that at some point governments give institutional investors the heads up to dump their holdings which would be followed by a ban on ownership. Wasn’t all that long ago that FDR made it illegal to hold gold...

Same. If you include my stock portfolio I was up about 17% on the year so far. 
Now I’m down on the year by like 5-7% in terms of all investments purely from Bitcoin this last week. 
It’s only a loss if you sell though. If anything I think I may average down on BTC. Idk. It is frustrating though.
