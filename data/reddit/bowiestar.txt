i just bought some bitcoin to give away to people who had never used bitcoin before... and now they are HOOKED! even small amounts... once they see it show up in their wallet, they freak out and think it's the coolest thing that they have ever seen! if everyone on here just gave a small amount to people adoption would increase exponentially!

futures are up now almost 20%!! we have entered into some weird positive feedback loop where the futures and exchanges are powering up each other lol. check out this poll on CNBC (which i think is garbage but all the old financial system people read it.) 57% say that bitcoin is going to $100,000 lol:

@_date: 2017-12-10 19:46:24
i think it's better to actually get them set up with an app like coinbase, it's way more exciting than a paper wallet, because then they can actually see the bitcoin price fluctuations and play with transferring it and see how cool the technology is!

coinbase is the best on ramp for noobs. while i agree their fees are ridiculous, for someone new it is the easiest way to get started. more mature bitcoin uses i refer to exchanges.

because they are just testing it out on 1 site, their billing department has no clue about their bitcoin implementation, it's an outsourced billing company that has nothing to do with bitcoin. 
as far as your login problems, i'll find a support email for you to get the issue fixed and PM you.
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:52:50
i'm actually not one of their employees, i'm a long time lurker, though. if i did work for them i'd have no problem disclosing it as i don't think it would make the news any less important. i have a friend that works there, and i've been bugging him for ages about them accepting bitcoin as i think porn+bitcoin is really what will help push this mainstream... today he told me they are doing a pilot program with one site as a test and i got really excited and said i'd post on reddit about it.
i mean it's really perfect... a non-recurring method of payment that is almost anonymous. just what porn needs! no more wives asking wtf that charge on the CC was for.

mtgox probably already had the malleability fix completed within 48 hours. look at the other exchanges that inserted the same fix-- it took them 1-2 days. they are just trying to take AS LONG AS POSSIBLE to open up the exchange again because they are trying to stockpile fiat from people unfortunate enough to be making deposits. they are most likely insolvent and they know that there will be a flood of people exiting. they are finished.

flattered that you think i'm a social media guru, haha... i did spend time putting together the post because i think it's really important. i don't work for them and i'm really not a social media guy, just a bitcoin enthusiast that wants to see it grow. the last week has been horrible, so i think we need some good news!

i don't know, i don't work there... this is a trial to gauge response. i would assume if it is successful and they roll it out across all their sites they will make changes based on how well it does.
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:03:45
they are using this as a test to see if there is interest... so i would think its pretty big news, hopefully people rally around this so they roll out widestream adoption.

barry knows what he's talking about, and i look forward to using his exchange in the future. we are in the process of weeding out the bad apples, and that takes time, but bitcoin is resilient and will come back stronger than ever.

totally. right now their ad has absolutely no 'hook' to make you want to find out more about what's on the billboard. very useless. from an ad creative perspective they are pretty much wasting their money, it's just a very poor creative -- the only people that will give the ad a second look are people who already know about bitcoin. also their website is very amateur looking, and their mission statement about educating the public about bitcoin falls short, when they could be getting so many more eyeballs to the website with a more professional ad campaign.

the scariest part of this article: "In addition, a freedom of information request revealed an even more aggressive stance being debated by FINTRAC. The request revealed that Canada has been considering "chok(ing) bitcoins oxygen (sic)” by denying Canadians access to the foreign-exchange market and even the possibility of forcing exchanges underground."
basically that means if you have bitcoins and live in canada, you will be unable to sell them on any exchange, even ones outside of the country as the [fiat] funds will be blocked from entering canada.
scary stuff.
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:54:50
with china increasingly having a smaller impact on the price/volume of BTC, this has brought a lot more stability and an upward trend. hopefully it stays this way! 
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:58:29
support is who you should be contacting for this, since they are the bitcoin payment processor for this site.

i've been hearing this same bullshit about bitcoin since it hit $1 per coin. boom, bust, boom, bust. the cycle will continue forever. bitcoin will never die. there is no chance it will ever hit $0. even if everyone stops mining tomorrow, there will be someone out there who will just mine for fun... its unkillable at this point and will ALWAYS have some kind of value.

eventually, it seems, there will be no point in 'cashing out' bitcoin to dollars, because you will be able to buy/do anything with bitcoin that you can with cash/dollars... so there is no point in ever selling.

this article really pissed me off. transactions are at an all time high. the author says that countries central banks will issue their own digital currencies which will kill bitcoin. LOL. the whole reason people use bitcoin is BECAUSE it isn't issues by a central bank and is decentralized! he also said that digital currencies can't be taken home and stored in a vault. 
this guy is CLUELESS and doesn't get it!
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:06:16
actually they didn't have a choice but to remove it since coinbase removed their custodial merchant service. if they wanted to they could have set up their own merchant service like cheapair.com did.

how can segwit2x happen when their node count is almost non-existent?

start a thread about bitpremier.com please
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:10:57
honestly, i hope it does. it will be horrible for the ecosystem and price.
their main complaint is that fees are high so they want bigger blocks. well, how about waiting 6 months for segwit adoption and lightning network and then there will no longer be high fees... 
though fees have come down and very low fee transactions are going through.
segwit2X is bitcoin suicide.
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:00:07
why does worship this proven fraud? they're delusional. he is a proven criminal and fraud. the guy is mentally ill.
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:58:02
i say do it BUT only if its PROPERLY TESTED FIRST. segwit2x is RUSHED, centralized and has a very small dev pool, it's a joke.
core could even at the last minute release a 2mb upgrade before the hard fork thus taking power back from segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:10:10
he's very angry lol
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:44:15
if you do it, please ONLY do it if you are going to hold for at least 3-5 years. bitcoin is the best performing currency in the world, and will most likely be for a long time to come. but if you are going to invest everything into it, you shouldn't be paying attention to the daily price fluctuations.
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:54:18
i'm not trying to shill for them at all... i don't have one.
this is more a sign of mainstream adoption than anything. their fees are really high -- 1.99% just to load the card and 3% for currency conversion.
but keep in mind there are still a LOT of things you can't buy directly with bitcoin. most places still don't take it, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:36:55
bitcoin-yoda is a troll who says mean things to everybody because he is a keyboard warrior with no life, who attacks anyone who posts anything. he sits in the new submissions area replying to every new post. ignore him, he's an idiot from a 3rd world country. if you have nothing nice to say, why bother attacking people that are new instead of trying to help them in a constructive manner? we're all in this together, and the more people that use bitcoin the more we all benefit from the network effect.
there are lots of exchanges you can use. coinbase is what most of the new people to bitcoin use, but their fees are outrageously high, and they are having a lot of problems scaling their platform to handle the new influx of new users, hence their site/app not working half the time lately.
if you are located in the states i'd give Gemini a try... if you move your bitcoins off of coinbase, no you are not charged anything. you really should be holding the coins in a 'real' wallet, not on an exchange. if you don't hold the coins yourself, you don't really own them. there are many different wallets you can use, such as the bitcoin core wallet. just make sure to password protect it and back it up in a few places. best of luck!
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:42:17
it's really not that complicated. you install the core software, then transfer the coins from coinbase to core. just keep backups and password protect the wallet and you're good. lots of FAQs and info around to read.
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:09:31
