i am 100% investing if they do. Ambani family cant be stopped in India by anyone lol. I would 100% invest even if Ambani family opens a company that sells packets full of air in India.

did any of you guys look into Tron/TRX. i invested in it and made a good profit so far. dont know the future of this coin  but i throw some money in every coin just in case. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:27:31
is it 100k yet ? No ? HODL
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:59:36
thats all the BCash holders who didnt sell when they had chance :D
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:45:00
i will just take what i invested and leave the profit there for couple of years to see what happens.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:02:38

@_date: 2017-12-13 00:36:45

@_date: 2017-12-13 00:42:14
well i like to get in early, bought them few months ago and today i checked and there was some decent profit waiting for me :D 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:50:22
i am just gonna pretend i knew that when i bought 100k of trx
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:42:48
TRON/TRX is almost triple in price in few days and going up fast
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:56:52
yeah, i will be honest here that i am not a good trader, i just buy stuff and "HODL", this has made me good profit so far. if i can do this kids, so can you. after reading about CEO of TRON, i have hope.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:48:50
did u assume that. TRIGGERED
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:30:42
i saw this coin at very low price on binance so i bought like 100k of them, i suddenly went like 45% up and made me good money so far. i dont know much about it. i just like to throw some money in small coins as well. profited from Litcoin and Tron so far. Bitcoin is still my main chick tho ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:29:49

water is not wet, a water molecule doesnt have a state. i dont remember getting in this argument tho. wtf going on 
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:51:26
water is not wet tho scientifically speaking 
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:35:31
my god the education system has failed you guys. how can water be wet? water wets other things, it can not itself be wet. just like fire, it burns thing but its not burned.  we dont say this fire is burned or this ocean is wet.did you forgot the middle school science lessons? wet ? covered or saturated with water or another liquid? anyway i dont really care about educating you here, takes about 5 mins to study what water is and u can do it urself.

@_date: 2018-02-03 15:16:28
sorry man, just a science guy. water is just three atoms that make up a molecule. It cannot itself be wet, :D

its not grammatically wrong but i agree it could be confusing and annoying for some people that dont like science. sorry to break it to you but Water is not wet. 
This guy explains it pretty well &gt;
