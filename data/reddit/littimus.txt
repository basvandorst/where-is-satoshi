I'm pretty sure that's not Mark Karpeles. MtGox was founded by Jed McCaleb and then sold to Mark Karpeles in 2011. Given that those posts are from July 2010, I'm betting that isn't Karpeles.

to automatically link. And I agree, this would be okay there.

Why is everyone downvoting this guy? It seems like a genuine concern / question.

Thanks! Satoshis Box was the best one I could find. I wish there was an actual android app store that accepts Bitcoin. Maybe that will be my next project.

I'm running ElementaryOS and I go to all the shady websites :D Once, I accidentally opened a bad .exe. It managed to open in Wine, screw up a bunch of files, and then the "installer" crashed. I'm really skeptical that I'll ever receive a virus / keylogger on a linux distro. No one writes viruses for them unless they're specifically targeting you.

Honestly, I've seen this exact comment more often than I've seen the "we did it guys!" comments...

You mean a custom picture or something? It allows a custom color at the moment.

Can we get this post removed / hidden or something until its verified? They've already made 500 mBTC and it could be a scam. OP hasn't replied in an hour.

And it shut down after MtGox collapse :( I can't believe there aren't any other services like this.

Just sent an email. Here are the options I chose:
1. Something Else (ignore options that show up)
2. More non-order questions -&gt; Opportunities for improvement
3. Email

How does everyone's email keep getting compromised? I have *never* been hacked on any account on any website (that I know of).

I'm pretty unfamiliar with selling digital goods for BTC, so if there is a better way, please let me know and I'll get it set up.

The most likely? I would say Dorian actually being Satoshi is more likely considering the circumstances.
Why, if the account was hacked, would the hacker post *that*?
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:33:08
Well, it downloads a 25 kB file every five minutes so...
25 kB * 12 (per hour) * 24 (hours) = 7200 kB / day. Which is ~7MB per day.
Unfortunately, I never actually paid attention to how much it was downloading (I'm on unlimited). However, after calculating it for the first time today, I will most likely be improving this soon.
Keep in mind that you can restrict access to mobile data usage by going to Settings -&gt; Data usage -&gt; LiveBTC -&gt; Restrict background data.
This will allow it to update prices only when you're using WiFi, and (thanks to my most recent update) won't break the app. As soon as WiFi is gained, it will automatically update, as well.
edit: Keep in mind...

I did, too! Except, I bought from Overstock. Tigerdirect had way higher shipping &amp; handling costs than did Overstock.
I bought a car charger for my phone. It felt good.

Really? What Android version are you on?

What are people in Ukraine going to do with Bitcoin exactly? Your FAQ just says the funds will be disbursed. What are the people going to do after they receive Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:34:01
That's a really good point.
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:08:10
In response to this, should we really be advertising Bitcoin this way?
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:26:00
It makes BTC look less "legitimate" IMO. Which, I thought, was one of our bigger problems. Then again, that exact ad one month ago was what made me finally check out bitcoin, so I don't really know, just a curious concern :)
