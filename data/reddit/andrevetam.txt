Don't know if they're scam or not but let me share a history that I had with them... I bought a small contract and the network was slow, so the price of the contract updated and the bs started. They told me that I needed to pay more 0.00129604 BTC to activate the contract. I transfered 0.009 BTC (my wallet minimum limit) after Shaun (BTC pool developer) agreed in refund me. Then he told me that he was giving me a "discount" to activate the contract and he didnt gave me any refund because the price of the contract was higher. Basically, I owed him a small quantity of BTC and he charged me something like 7.5 times more. This is the kind of crap that I had to deal and what happened to me. In my humble opinion, dont trust them.
