This was probably back in 2013, they had mining pools. I remember turning off my gaming rig when it was only making like 2 BTC per month because I got tired of the heat and noise lol

"it was also written in computer languages that might not exist yet, with different syntaxes/rules, and maybe even a diffent mining algo"
lol,  this is as far as I could get

It can be used that way, go ahead and try to wire 50 bucks to a friend without involving someone that has a banking license

This, people underestimate the value in storing some of your bitcoin in a way that makes it very difficult to retrieve. Most of my btc is in cold storage and in a very safe location and there have been a few times I thought about selling a few and decided against it because I don’t need dollars and it would be a pain in the ass to get them.

There was someone on here years ago when bitcoin first went to 1K that bought 500 BTC back when it was trading around 1 dollar to buy some drugs on silk road and chickened out.  He forgot about it until he saw something about the price going up so much. Not sure what he did with it probably sold at 250.

You should only sell at a price you are comfortable with then only buy back if the price goes below your sell price. And never sell your full investment.

I don't know how to do a time locked address but just having your coins in cold storage is great for me, its a real pain in the cunnings to go dig it out of my safe that I keep buried in a remote location that nobody knows about except my cat.  That gives you plenty of time to think before you go through with selling them.

Consider yourself lucky, you probably would have dropped a bunch on an asic from butterfly labs lol

There are two gambles with bitcoin, there is short-term fiat price fluctuations and it's pretty risky. The other gamble is on blockchain itself which I think and probably most people here would agree is a much better bet, thus hold

Actually yes, when I am working on one of my miners (I gpu mine) I think of it in terms of how many SAT it produces per day as an example you can expect about 20,000 from a GTX 1080 Ti I also find it easier to think of things I'm shopping for that way also, a T-shirt may cost about 700K as an example, it may seem strange at first but once you get used to it its much better than working with decimals.

I did most of my mining back in 2012-2013 now days I just keep a few hobby rigs running back when I ran a farm I used Linux but I'm more comfortable with Windows so I just use that with nicehash now.  It used to be a lot more work than it is today. Running more than a couple cards was not very well supported back then and you ended up having to do a lot of troubleshooting, rebooting etc.

maybe not, but it probably doesn't hurt to much for your two personalities to have contact with each other it makes it look that much more like its someone else.

I'm not saying that Hal is Satoshi but it may be to your advantage to create two personas, one public and the other private.

If you are smart enough to create a revolutionary currency and you are very concerned about your privacy you are probably smart enough to apply techniques to anonymize your writing style.

No, 100 million
@_date: 2018-07-11 20:33:21
I do all of my figuring in Satoshi's now so 280,000 SAT
@_date: 2018-07-13 11:45:02
lol, I made so much mining over the years I don't think about the price on much of anything anymore.
