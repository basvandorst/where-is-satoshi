Any type of bitcoin mining hardware is a scam.

Today you released the Factom API - what is this for and what can it do?
@_date: 2014-09-02 16:52:43
I guess someone needed to educate Max Keiser
@_date: 2014-12-22 23:01:28
what are the details for the hackathon?

"we’ll be pioneering a milestone-based fund vesting structure. All fund withdrawal request will only be possible upon hitting certain product milestones and subject to multi-sig approval from an independent project arbitrator."
Finally some crowdsale protection

yep 11k emails !! 
@_date: 2014-10-22 03:22:09
awesome, I was looking for something other than PDF. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-18 23:04:57
awesome! I went to university in Victoria, glad to see Bitcoin traction there
@_date: 2014-10-21 03:47:37
awesome 
@_date: 2014-10-13 03:35:03
pretty cool
@_date: 2014-10-23 03:56:35
Its the first crypto wallet and encrypted chat
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:25:18
Supporting! Interesting project 
@_date: 2014-10-19 21:52:17
BITCOIN! 
@_date: 2014-11-24 07:53:51
Why are you concentrating on getting so many exchanges out there? Surely you will saturate the market that way.
@_date: 2014-09-25 05:09:06
This completes my survival pack for the apocalypse
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:05:12

AWESOME. I have been following your BitSat project Garzik!
@_date: 2014-08-29 00:44:01
this is pretty huge, it opens up any blockchain transaction to an alarm, or text, or email, and even a blog post
@_date: 2014-09-04 01:14:07
MerchantCoin is a transitory currency and created for redemption amongst merchants who choose to accept Bitcoin. It's not meant to replace Bitcoin - and neither can people 'dump' MerchantCoin
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:15:48
What are the other use cases
@_date: 2014-11-07 02:02:47
Epic fail
@_date: 2014-09-29 04:12:55
This is cool
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:48:11
Bitpay is probably the biggest brand in Bitcoin today
@_date: 2014-10-19 22:59:49
Definitely the best support email I've seen from Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-08-30 01:34:51
thanks but I'm not interested in colored coins
@_date: 2014-09-18 05:39:04
Checked it out a few weeks ago, awesome selection and his dabs were insane. Got dizzy, faint, sweaty, hot, and high within seconds 
@_date: 2014-10-20 01:29:10
Yes and No. It will be an app, but it wont be about Bitcoin. Gems is designed as a Whatsapp and will use Counterparty tokens for in-app purchases. Counterparty uses the Bitcoin Blockchain.

funds flowing from the first tx, when satoshi sent bitcoins to Hal

@_date: 2014-11-30 06:42:54
Why would you ever want to set up a node just to accept Bitcoin?
Get a Bip 32 wallet like Electrum
Use a block explorer - preferably Blocktrail as its not likely to have a key logger
@_date: 2014-10-17 19:29:32
They are a Bitcoin based project using the Counterparty protocol
@_date: 2014-10-13 03:32:34
You are not alone.

The definition of Appcoins applied here is inaccurate 
@_date: 2014-09-27 22:04:53
if I could plug in different Exchange APIs and customize the dashboard that would be awesome. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 18:41:37
I like this Dmitri - he knows much bitcoin
@_date: 2014-08-29 18:16:56
I think this is a first for any Bitcoin wallet, havent seen crowdfunding integrated on a wallet until now
@_date: 2014-09-23 17:54:43
nice work btcdrak
@_date: 2014-11-30 06:40:34
I got the same phishing email

The Blue Screen of death - to my heart
@_date: 2014-10-21 19:07:36
Another reason Trucoin might actually succeed in this arena, no waiting times to receive Bitcoin but its not available in every state yet.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:31:07
how is Storj going to use Factom?
@_date: 2014-10-23 02:15:24
lamestream media reporting at its best
@_date: 2014-11-24 07:53:13
 How is your exchange platform decentralized?
@_date: 2014-10-18 06:49:35
its not a pyramid 
and neither is it a shitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-09 04:59:17
wanted to see some nudes
@_date: 2014-09-27 22:07:26
Cool story bro
@_date: 2014-11-24 07:54:06
Why would anybody choose you over any of the other White Label exchange providers? 
@_date: 2015-05-09 06:34:10
You'd know em if you saw one because they all love Rand Paul

Interesting way to build a social network

gutenberg bible project on factom demonstrates the use case. that you can take a file of any size and hash it in the blockchain
@_date: 2015-03-17 01:53:04
the fact that you want to have an intellectual debate on reddit is laughable.
@_date: 2015-02-25 02:41:15
unless you work for INTERPOL, DARPA, CIA, FBI - I dont care if you've written or researched anything.
Sounds like you're jealous - why dont you present a paper on how Malware on the Blockchain "is pointless and doesn't have any serious advantages" 
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:16:12
Whats interesting is that INTERPOL is warning us about this ;p
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:43:38
Crypto-Currency will change the world!
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:46:40
You're right there might be a bubble here, but the rise of crypto-currency will continue even if Bitcoin pops
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:35:26
1. Can I ask where you bought it from
2. How much was it
3. How much are your fees
4. Besides fees, what are the other ways this is generating money - i.e. arbitrage?
5. Did you look into insurance for this, and is it available
6. How did you choose your location
Thanks! Incredibly interesting and best of luck!

The black swan known as Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:39:18
I've heard about this on Black Market Reloaded, saw listings that offer double your BTC back 
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:49:56
Tried transferring from a Canadian bank and only US is accepted right now. 
Will this be available for Canada soon?
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:21:42
1. Stability
2. Not subject to government influence
3. For the people, by the people
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:00:50
It would be possible with a quantum computer
