Neat. I have been following bitcoin since it first began but only recently invested. As soon as I realised how the block chain worked I decided to go both feet in. Now I'm looking to start working with bitcoins and crypto, but not sure where to start.

The 100K transaction backlog is Core's fault!!! They could have fixed the backlog you by allowing Segwit 2x to go ahead. With 2MB blocks, there would be no delays on the network by now but because Bitcoin can only support 1MB blocks, any wallet with less than $100 in it is immobilised or else paying a 30-50% fee to transfer out its value.
THIS IS THE INTENTIONAL DESTRUCTION OF BITCOIN.

What, like Segwit, which delivers 1.7x the throughput with 4 the bandwidth? Nice! Also, I am an engineer, and understand exactly what scaling means. I also understand how badly the Bitcoin network is failing to deliver on its promise right now and that's my main concern.

Visa process 2,500 transactions per second. That’s a lot less than 30,000 which is a 10,000x increase. 
To scale to visa levels that would require a 1gb block size which is equivalent to 50TB/year. You can already buy a 10TB drive off the shelf so don’t give me that ‘out of reach’ crap. It won’t scale to that level for another 5-10 years by which time a 50GB hard drive will be something you can pick up at Best Buy. Moore’s law is still very much alive and applies just as much to RAM and storage costs as it does to processing power. 
Why are you so fixated on everyone and their grandma being able to run a node? The fact is that hardly anyone does, and if you spam the system with a bunch of layer two solutions there will be even fewer. 
Also, Segwit is a block size increase to 4MB for a 1.66x increase in transactions. What the fuck? If you just made the block 4x bigger, you could have done 4x the volume. Hopeless.

Lightning is the worst idea ever. Imagine having to front the cash for any potential transaction you want to make every time you want to buy something. It’s the equivalent of having to set up an ‘account’ with Starbucks preloaded with cash so that you can buy coffee. So you load your funds for 10 coffees in there and they are stuck there unless you wanna pay the fees to move them out. When I found out how Channels are created I laughed because it was so shit and thought I was being duped. 
It replicates one of the best features of bitcoin badly and in such a way that the whole trustless nature of the machine is gone. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:03:22
Fine. So scale on chain first and go with whatever when it’s ready. But it’s not ready. Why hold everyone at the 1mb block limit when it is so severely crippling the network??? This is lunacy. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:07:47
It can handle twice as many transactions which, on a network as congested as bitcoin, can only be a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 11:27:31
Consider that $10 in 2010 is over $1,000,000 now. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:49:30
Why can’t we just scale on-chain? Make the block bigger to fit more transactions. That would do more than Segwit ever has. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:23:37


I love how you guys think you're so smart. We shall see how this pans out.
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:00:46
Bitcoin used to be awesome and now it's fucked. The fees have gone from 2c-5c to $2-$5 in about 2 years because the current block size cannot handle the transaction load. Telling me to sell my btc because I don't like it is no way to frame your argument. You tell my why the block size should not be increased? The only metric that matters at the moment is this one: 
and this is the one that it will fix.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:11:02


No, but for segwit to even achieve that increase you need 100% of transactions to remove the transaction data. Last I checked it was at 8% and falling. Segwit doesn't and will never do shit.
The BCH scaling method which just makes a bigger block to fit more transactions is far more simple and far more effective. All the bitcoin core narrative of segwit being better for scaling than bigger blocks is completely false once you actually read how it works.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:08:12
Nice read! Thanks :-)
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:13:50
And your ‘post’ that you sent me to is nonsense. You think that by calling people dumb they will think you are smart when quite the opposite is true. You have provided no counter arguments to anything I have said. All ou are is rude. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:59:09
So what are they doing to fix the congestion? So far I see a complete stagnation of progress. 'Lightning' which is a broken idea as far as I can tell is at least a year (more like 18 months) away and the network is broken NOW. WHAT IS YOUR PLAN CORE? COME HERE AND TELL ME.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:47:30
Better than the core attitude of do nothing. 
Oh wait, LN right? How far away is that? Last I heard 18 months. How many unconfirmed transactions will be on the network by then if you don't grow the blocksize.

Doesn't that mean trusting a third party?
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:17:47
Nice. So you came up with Segwit, which actually fundamentally changes bitcoin and makes it no longer compliant with the original whitepaper.
Great work fellas. Also its not as good as bigger blocks for scaling. How can you not see that?

@_date: 2017-10-28 05:14:50
If you are in favour of on chain scaling, what is your thoughts on the current situation? The network is grinding to a halt and a bunch of people ar telling us there’s nothing to be done because if anything changes it won’t run on a raspberry pi in ten years time. That is why this is happening. I hope 2x crushes 1x and we can scale effectively from there. I also hope segwit dies a slow death. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:23:52
Also, please tell me how Segwit (which gives a LINEAR MULTIPLE SCALING OF JUST 1.66x) is going to fix this problem? Even if 100% of all transactions were segwit they still won't fit on a 1MB block. Unless there is something I am missing in any of this.

So as bitcoin scales, you are going to get more and more transactions happening. If, as you say, each one is 400B of data, how do you cram more of them into a block? Is that not what bigger blocks would do? Maybe it’s not a long term solution, but we need action on this _now_. What are the arguments against big blocks anyway? Why should I have to go online and check the mempool every time I want to make a transaction? What if I can’t? You say 33c per transaction? Even that is completely incompatible with a modern day service economy. What is the plan to fix it?
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:22:47


This is from the r/bitcoin subreddit. The process of using lightning is so convoluted that nobody will want to use it. Why do I have to put my funds into your network before I can buy anything? What if I want to buy something else with that money? I have to close the channel. It seems that it will actually increase the amount of traffic on the network.


You think 80,000 unconfirmed transactions is fine? 4 days for a confirmation is fine? $5/transaction fees is fine? You keep your coin pal. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:30:09
Impatience? Call it anger. The system is broken!
According to the Mempool chart you send me to, the last block did not even confirm 25% of the transactions in the pool. 2 days ago there were over 80,000 transactions in the queue and nothing less than a 250sat/B fee would get you confirmation. The current best blocks are barely squeezing 2500 transactions in there even with 14% segwit. What if 100% of the transactions were segwit? How many could you fit in a 1MB block? The best info I can find is around 12195 transactions per block, which with 10 minute blocks is about 20 transactions per second. I don't know about your, but for a global currency that does not seem anywhere near enough. 
It's really hard to sort the FUD out from the real information, but it's clear to me that BTC needs to come up with something serious in faster than the expected 18 month timeframe that Lightning is currently expected to take.

@_date: 2017-10-29 23:16:17
Do you even know how bitcoin works? The congestion is there because the miners are restricted to 1MB of transactions per block. If they increased the blocksize, the number of transactions that each block could fit would scale accordingly.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:26:19
I read both r/bitcoin and r/btc and what I see is that r/bitcoin regularly censor anybody trying to talk about these problems and have a heads in the sand approach to this looming crisis. The 1MB block limit has to go. At least with Segwit 2X we have a chance at saving the BTC network.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:57:51
Segwit doesn't fix shit. It makes the blocks 4 times bigger for a 1.7x increase in the number of transactions. The only difference is that all the transaction data (which makes bitcoin transactions immutable) is removed from the block. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:54:22
Hi there,
Most of the issues stem from Bitcoin Core's stubborn attitude around increasing the size of blocks on the bitcoin network. This causes massive congestion and very high fees. 
Here is my post on just this issue from this morning:
Also, r/bitcoin is highly moderated and censored. r/btc is not which for me means that community is much more open to criticism and analysis. The Bitcoin Core team will quickly delete any posts critical of them or their products. What have they got to fear??
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:39:45
It’s not that core _can’t_ change a constant, it’s that they’re so fucking fixated on peddling their own layer 2 ‘solutions’ that they _won’t_. I concede on the difficulty algo. They fucked that good. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:15:05
Because if we scale on-chain we don’t need a malleability fix. The only reason segwit is even a thing is so that lightning will work. The sole reason lightning is a thing is to fix the issues being created by not allowing on chain scaling. 
There is no reason not to scale on chain. The low tech node is being used as an excuse to cripple bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 10:42:20
Sounds like a settlement layer...
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:41:06
The miners will then follow the market thereby creating the chain with the most accumulated difficulty.
