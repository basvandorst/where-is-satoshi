Bullshit.  As it stands now I see 3, possibly 4 currencies for the internet.
1. Ethereum, for business purposes
2. Monero, for the privacy minded
3.  Nano (maybe iota), every day cash
4. Possibly some new coin that hasn't even been made yet which combines the privacy of monero, the capabilities of ethereum, and the fee less nature of nano.

Just to write transactions then.  The transactions can then be put onto other internet connected hardware.

Write the transaction on the computer then put on other hardware.  Maybe print transaction as a qr code to scan into other hardware.

Doesn't need to be cheaper than a hardware wallet.  Just something that could be dedicated without ever touching anything other than a dedicated wallet.  Hardware wallets still need other hardware to work which is where the possible, if unlikely, security comprises could come from.

I mean, I guess?  Kind of hard to write transactions that way but with enough time and paper anything's possible.

One could argue that he did in fact, do nothing wrong.  That argument is likely to come from a hardcore controversial libertarian, but it is an arguement to be made.

4% seems pretty good to me.  How much of the population bought their own stocks? Bonds? Physical precious metals?  For being such a new tech I'd say 4% is doing alright

Thank you OP, very cool!

It depends on your financial goals.  Having a finite supply of bitcoin was an intentional choice made in effort to resist inflation.  Other currencies actively pursue inflation because they have different financial goals.  One argument in favor of inflation is encourages spending instead of hoarding money.  Deflation tends to encourage the opposite.  For example "HODL" shows how people will stop spending money if they think it will increase in value.  While the dollar for example is known to inflate, which encourages spending that employs people.
It's not that one is always going to better than the other, it depends upon what you value and what you have in mind for you and your society's economic goals.

No.  My patriotism is not a measure of my loyalty to a government.  I love my country and way of life, that is my patriotism.  Bitcoin is just another showcasing that money and government do not need to be intertwined.  Money existed before any large government did.  It could sea shells, metals, beads, rice, beer, or pebbles which are used as money.  Governments are not required to make any of those.

Don't put all your eggs in one basket.  You would be much better off holing your cash in a bank account right now and just buying small amounts of bitcoin at a time.  try r/personalfinance to look for investment opportunities.  Right now however, your income is probably a lot more important than any investments you make.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:21:30
Their more confused on if/how they make a dollar off it.  So many people I talk to think bitcoin is some kind of scam, worthless, or scary internet hackers drug money.  Then I tell them I made $5 and their ears perk up like a dog who just saw you wave a ball in front of its face.

Bitcoin is available on phones, just in case that was sarcasm

I've never heard of woom-boom-dood-dobilators but I hear that they are going up in value.  I've done a little research and think I know what I'm doing.  Does anyone want to tell me to invest thousands upon thousands of dollars into something I maybe kinda sorta understand?  Or should I just do it anyway because there's no way the value of this stuff could ever go down for any reason ever?  
obligatory HODL

cash has been around a lot longer and banks know exactly how to use it in a manner that virtually guarantees them profits.  laws are written for banks and cash.  bitcoin is still new and banks haven't figured out how to guarantee profits and laws are not yet written in their favor for bitcoin.  even with legal considerations it's a lot harder to repo a bitcoin than it is to repo say, a house or a stack of cash.

protip: use gemini next time.  on the real though it should clear in another day or two.
