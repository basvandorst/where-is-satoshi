Exactly. Fuck, say you bet everything on a Bitcoin gambling site. No way they can subpoena a dodgy Russian business looking for evidence. It really is the Wild West here. Unless you fuck up and admit to a judge you have coins on a paper wallet or Trezor no one can ever prove you wrong (yet). If it did get that ugly that you're looking like you're going to lose half or more of your hard earned stack of coins - then a tumbling service is your best friend. Then, at worst they could subpoena Coinbase, prove your purchases, follow them in the Blockchain until they hit that big muthafucka of a wall at the tumbling service- no tracking coins from that point on. It looks dodgy if it came to that end - but fortunately being dodgy alone isn't a crime (yet). ;P

Nah, no salt. Just Murphy's Law that being secretive with family often ends badly. Karma etc.

You know how'll it end for him though. He'll die in a car accident or something and his wife will learn she has $5 million dollars in Bitcoin that she can never access as he took such high security methods no one can open his encrypted files!

Different argument. The issue was it was alleged to be a ponzi scheme. If it'd gone from cents to thousands, and the creator was a scammer, he'd have offloaded his coins when they'd got around to 10,000% profit. They're still there - one of the world's richest financial accounts I'd imagine and bordering on billions.

Isn't that amazing! Mind blown. Imagine the computing firepower they can realise now that heat capture is improved by 97%.

Yeah, fuck this guy. How dare this prick have in a nice clean pair of pants, tidy shoes and a nice car.  He'd look a shit ton much better wearing grotty pants low enough so his underwear was clearly visible, dirty Nike trainers, tattoos up his arm and flipping the bird in the pic like an A-Grade douche wanna-be gangsta. 
So, OP, if you're reading this, grow the fuck up, give yourself an uppercut and get with the program!

Riiiiiiight.

And he isn't talking about animals.

What's the ball park figure on setting up your mining setup? And what's your power costs per week? I'm fascinated that anyone other than Chinese miners can afford to make a profit mining Bitcoin?

I've seen your dad's work lifted and used on online Bitcoin news sites. Did he know that by chance? I don't have a link, saw it about a month ago, but remember it was the bull one. Awesome stuff. Official Bitcoin artist! :)

Busted :P
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:22:15
Precisely. /s

What are you talking about? Selling skins? WTF?
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:55:17
You don't measure it from your butt hole you know!

I'm on the core side of the argument- but, bloody hell, they better get cracking. It was a pretty freaky time to be watching the other day. I feared we were watching a slaughter in real time. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:50:23
I've got each of these. Good picks.

If it was created as a scam Satoshi's coins would be long gone by now. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:59:31
I literally don't know what you're talking about - but I'm curious?
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:38:13
And my thin piano tie too. :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:54:38
Got a source?

The recent photo of Ver, fake Satoshi and a dodgy brother out of central casting says to me people are involved in BCH that are in it for themselves- and they collectively make my skin crawl. They are sketchy personified.

I am no way affiliated with this guy - but you have to check out the Delta Crypto &amp; ICO Portfolio App. 
It allows you to enter your buys and track them in percentages and whatnot. It's bloody awesome and has become my major space (other than Reddit) to track my hodlings. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:54:44
It's true (unfortunately). I've been in since 2013 and even cut &amp; pasting from a text file address concerns me - especially with the malware out there that changes addresses when they're pasted. I triple check the pasted address, but it's like there's virtual burglars waiting when you go online to move coins.

If there's a Black Swan event with Bitcoin (fatal flaw in code) there's going to be 100's of Billions of dollars lost. Most/many coins use Bitcoin's blockchain as their code - so if there's a fatal breach we're all fucked (except those few who can unload first before the majority can).
