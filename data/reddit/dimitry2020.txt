There are two mnemonic seed consisting of the same words. The first gives the right to restore the wallet and the second is not. I rearranged the last two words. And how does the checksum work? Try creating a wallet with the last phrase...!

I use it:  it is not possible to open a new wallet. I used more than 1000 combinations of permutation of words that are in BIP39 and in the area of the puzzle disk. The result restored 60 wallets. Balance = 0
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:24:54
Explain why you have 1 word - WAY, 6 word - NETWORK, and so on?
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:40:17
In all options tried? I tried 600 options, but they also didn't have logic...
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:59:46
@_date: 2018-06-17 17:05:04
So the system checks whether the private key has transaction history or not and produces the result.
@_date: 2018-06-17 05:57:29
You're talking about the wallet recovery feature...perhaps it is. But in Blockchain.info there is another function - the creation of a new wallet. In this case, the system also has no idea whether it is new or old wallet?
@_date: 2018-06-10 07:06:00
You're probably right. In our dialogues, a new understanding of the puzzle. We'll move on....:-)
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:05:39
You try to open at least one wallet using your method....
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:29:18
Recovered 40 wallets. When you finish? Who knows?
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:39:12


I see. balance = 0 BTC. all wallets. I think it's a hoax....!
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:42:32
New information. Mnemonic seed can contain two identical words. for example: 6 and 8 the word - PLACE
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:15:28
try it, you will not have enough life....:-)
@_date: 2018-06-17 17:33:45
Thanks. And if the wallet is not open in Blockchain.info but restored in Blockchain.info, will the transaction history be visible immediately?
@_date: 2018-06-09 15:43:35
Hi. I was restoring access to the wallet using a mnemonic seed of 12 words on Blockchain.info All 12 words are taken from the puzzle and each word has a logical justification. Chance is completely excluded. Mnemonic seed is created by the blockchain system and is associated with all addresses of your wallet and cannot be changed. When you restore access to the wallet using mnemonic seed, the system creates a new wallet and transfers all transactions and addresses from the old wallet to it. It is impossible to create a new wallet from invented words. Who's not sure can try.....:- ) When I got access to the puzzle balance wallet = 0 BTC and no transactions. I look forward to hearing from cryptogreetings to clarify this.
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:44:36
You're right. Therefore, the one who came up with this puzzle should give some guarantee that everything is honest. He's quiet... Who opened these 40 + wallets?
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:38:19
At this address is big balance BTC: 3Ap6mixhHLmVtH41YHH94Ut4jBfmqRpzgq 
Im declare that the puzzle is hidden mnemonic seed of 12 words that gives access to these funds. WHO CAN REFUTE ME...!
@_date: 2018-06-08 20:24:30
**Hi. I solved the puzzle, typed in a 12-word phrase, and got access to wallet. In this wallet the balance is 0 BTC...!** What to do next? Is it cheating? I reported it cryptogreetings he didn't answer!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:53:38


I can't. because the key will become clear
@_date: 2018-06-09 04:29:31
I didn't create a new wallet. I rebuilt an existing wallet from 12 words mnemonic seed. Each word has a logical justification in the picture of the puzzle. This is not a coincidence!
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:36:40
You want to say that all the wallets are in the system? Like a pair of mnemonic seed and private key.
@_date: 2018-06-16 20:25:17
How then blockchain.info opens a new wallets? If there is no criterion to determine whether it is a new or old wallet? In other words, I opened a new wallet and after a while it was transferred to another person...?
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:38:56
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:27:31


In your words there is no logical chain associated with the puzzle and this should be present. My words are different from yours. But you are right that these words also work. Then the solution to the puzzle is to sort out a lot of options for words - this is nonsense for fools.
@_date: 2018-06-17 06:07:48
There are three ways to access the funds: 1. need to have wallet ID and password, 2. private key, 3. mnemonic seed.
@_date: 2018-06-09 05:01:49
**I am ready to publish the 12 words after receiving a reply from cryptogreetings. But he is silent and recently deleted all his messages in the chat... What's it?**
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:04:45


In the puzzle hidden 100 wallets....? :-)
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:26:13
 Please explain
@_date: 2018-06-17 11:26:59
Note the number 0001 at the bottom of the puzzle. This number is not in the white pages. If you use BIP 39 Wordlist, the first mnemonic word is - ABILITY.
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:05:57
I have a question to cryptogreetings. 6 word - TRUST or MUST? I don't think that would be a significant clue!
@_date: 2018-06-10 16:54:08
Hi. I want to share information. When restoring access to the wallet using a mnemonic seed, the previous owner of the wallet does not know that he lost funds! He doesn't receive any messages on his e-mail or phone. The whole history of the transaction restores immediately. Today restored 8 wallets! Balance = 0
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:48:47
@_date: 2018-06-14 03:59:00
Are you sure this exists?
@_date: 2018-06-17 17:15:23
OK. Thank you. Then the first word is ONE. 1 next to "try", matches the color, angle and font size.
@_date: 2018-06-17 08:51:03
But such a possibility still there? :-) Nicely. When I restore my own wallet using mnemonic seed, the system does not generate a new private key but gives access to the existing key. Right? The mnemonic seed and the private key are one, like " Siamese twins." Right?
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:43:39
Hi. I have a different logic to solve the puzzle. I can't say until I'm done...:-) 19 wallets regained balance = 0 Where's the consolation prize?....:-)
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:37:34
Hi. You are not using the Try+1 hint. Using this hint, I selected 50 mnemonic seed combinations. These are the same words in different combinations. As a result, I got access to 8 wallets with a balance = 0. I use the link: https: / / blockchain.info/en/wallet/# / help [Recovery Funds]. If it worked differently I would have opened 50 wallets.
