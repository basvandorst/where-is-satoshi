Is there a graph somewhere of ethereum blockchain size over time? I found a graph of individual block size over time, but not the whole blockchain.

I don't think that it's accurate to call it a cryptocurrency. There will be no blockchain nor mining, and it will only be tradable on bitfinex. It's probably more accurate to call it an IOU, or scrip.

I'm not sure it's the right thing to do, but one option would be to buy fiat at fixed exchange rates and burn the fiat, effectively allowing the world to move to BTC without disruption and fiat hyperinflation.
This would of course mean that the current distribution of wealth would be preserved, which might not be ideal, but could well be better for everyone than a complete fiat meltdown.
@_date: 2014-06-10 07:54:45
You could also add a fixed maximum amount you would purchase of each currency, as well as a fixed term under which the deal would be available. Both those things, along with an exchange rate that was fixed upon publication of the deal, would mean that the value of fiat would not be inflated.

Since bitcoin provides automatic interoperability, there is no winner-takes-all, or at least winner-takes-most network effect like in traditional payment processing. I expect we'll see zillions of bitcoin payment processors. The future's so bright I gotta wear shades ^_^

I think I made it too hard by using port 80, since there a ton of machines with port 80 open, which will slow down a port scan.
I'm going to switch the port, although on the off chance that someone is scanning all of the internet right now, I'll keep it running on port 80 too.

I hopefully fixed both issues. The program now uses threads, it no longer hangs, and handles exceptions properly, just in case s.accept() can throw an exception.

I'm assuming that most installations are 64 bit, so you'll need IDA Professional.
And also, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that it's not possible. It's definitely possible, it's just not trivial, and more bugs could sneak through that way. I don't think it's a good practice.
@_date: 2017-04-01 05:15:27
When a language like C or C++ is translated into machine code, small changes in the original source can translate into large, unintuitive changes in the machine code.
Machine code is hard to read. Many errors are possible in machine code which are not possible in C or C++. "Trust me, this binary does what I say it does." is not good enough.
Optimizing the process to defeat script kiddies is not a sound strategy. The process should be optimized to defeat talented, dedicated, malicious programmers. If reading a diff between two binaries is trivial, then it only protects against the script kiddies, who are a lesser threat.

I think that the root of the blowback is the use of the word "trustless". I'm a huge fan of the Prism concept*, but the use of the word "trustless" in marketing and blog posts is problematic. Even though the behavior of the oracle is observable and auditable, one must still trust the oracle, whether it is run by ShapeShift or some other third party.
I personally think that minimal trust systems are still incredibly valuable, they just need to be responsibly marketed to describe them as they are. Just gotta come up with a better marketing term than "much less trust than all the trust but still more than none".
\* Can I have an beta invite so that I can hopefully be converted to being a fan of the implementation too?

Unfortunately the reality of software development is that it's impossible to be 100% confident in a program until you've used it in a situation which resembles real-world use.
For cryptocurrency code, the right thing to do is test it privately, then test it on a testnet, then test it on a mainnet with real money.
I'm not super familiar with the lightning network project, but I think having an additional testing phase on mainnet with a soft cap is sensible and responsible. Imagine how much drama would have been avoided if the DAO had been test-launched with a soft cap.
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:23:55
I don't think that that's guaranteed, although it might be overwhelmingly likely.
Many private keys might turn out to hash to the same value, and there might be hashes that no valid private key hashes to.

Even for addresses generated to be bitcoin eaters, it's possible that a private key does exist for it.
Although, I mean, given that you would need to do brute force search to find those private keys, they're still definitely lost forever, in the sense OP means.

Sorry for the incompatibility! I did something in JavaScript that Firefox doesn't support, and certain GPUs are blacklisted by Chrome, so it doesn't even work there all the time.

I'm interested in promoting knowledge and ownership of bitcoin among the general, non-techy population. I think people will be much more interested in bitcoin if they own a little bit.
I would probably put a little strip of opaque removable tape labeled "keep secret!" over the private key.

So, things I would include would be:
* A very short plain english description of bitcoin.
* A brief lecture on how private keys should be kept private, and how if you lose them, the balance is gone, and how since I gave them this private key, it shouldn't be trusted, and should be swept to another wallet immediately.
* How to create a wallet.
* How to sweep the balance from the given private key.
* How to transfer the balance to a charity or other worthy project. (instead of sweeping it)
* A place to learn more, probably weusecoins.com
Can you think of anything else that would be important, or other options for using the bitcent? I would be trying to keep it as light and non-overwhelming as possible, but still want to provide as many concrete possibilites as possible, and give a little taste of the wonders of bitcoin.
I was thinking "worst-tip-ever.com" would be a good domain :)
@_date: 2013-04-17 12:58:12

I like the idea of making it simpler, but don't you think that too simple might be a bad thing in this case?
I think it's important to understand a few things to use bitcoin, even for a non-savvy, non-technical person, and I wouldn't want to gloss over that. Things like:
* A private key is just a number. Unless you save it somewhere, nobody else is keeping track of it for you. If you have the only copy, and you lose it, it's gone.
* The address can be derived from the private key, but not vice versa. This means that the address can be shared, and you can regenerate the address from the private key if you happen to lose it.
* Private keys must be kept private. Anyone with the key can move the funds that it owns anywhere.
I kind of don't like it that a lot of programs use the "wallet" as the basic unit. A wallet is a complex, multi-part data structure, and what it contains, where it's stored, and what you can do with it vary between implementations.
Compare that to a private key and address pair. They have simple rules, and are the same across implementations. (Modulo the fact that there are a few different representations of both.) I think there would be fewer "I lost all of my bitcoins" posts out there if people understood the basic mechanics of addresses.
It's kind of like the difference between paper money and something more complicated that is ultimately derived from paper money, like a credit card, bank account, or checkbook. You wouldn't want to give somebody a credit card if they didn't understand the basics of money.
@_date: 2013-04-28 08:47:44
I could create a very simple tutorial on how to generate a new wallet with a web service like blockchain.info, and transfer the balance to it. I think it would only be a few steps long, and pretty manageable even by non techy people.
It would also kind of be a cool starter transaction, just moving the money between keys.
Also, I would probably include the advice that since this private key was generated by someone else, and thus can't be trusted, they should transfer the money out as a matter of course.
@_date: 2013-04-28 08:37:07
Yeah, it is kind of annoying. I might clip it to a dollar bill, so it isn't such a weak tip. I would only leave it as a tip at a coffee shop or bar, not a restaurant. (Where 0.01BTC would be a pretty shitty tip, crypto or fiat.)
[edit] I would consider saving the private key and transferring the btc out if there's no activity on the wallet after a year, or six months, or whatever, but that feels a little shady.

Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Actually, Dwolla charges no fee for receiving less than $10 and withdrawing money to a linked account. It would be pretty complicated, but the mt-gox -&gt; dwolla part would only be $0.25, so they could get at least a dollar :)

I like the idea of making it simpler, but I don't like the idea of trying to gloss over the fact that there is a shareable address and a private key, and that they are different things and must be handled differently. I think this is the minimum knowledge to use bitcoin, and would want a new user to be aware of it from the beginning.
I cringe whenever I see one of those posts from someone who says something like, "I upgraded windows and my wallet's gone, what happened?" and it's clear that they don't understand what their wallet actually IS, and where it lives.

Mt. Gox isn't bitcoin, although point taken. They would have to create some kind of wallet, but they could always do something with it on the bitcoin network, like give it to a charity.
Also, I think it's kind of cool, even if it's impractical. I like getting foreign coins and learning about new things, and this sort of combines both.

The learning curve is very steep, but it flattens out quickly.
The learning curve to fiat money, the banking system, monetary policy, credit card processing, the ACH, and the rest of it starts out very flat -- "Here, take these dollar bills, you can trade them for stuff because the government says so." -- but then becomes steeper the deeper you get into it.

Something that a lot of people miss is that scrypt is parameterizable, and as parameterized in litecoin is gimped. See this twitter thread with Colin Percival, the creator of scrypt:
It only requires between 64k and 128k per thread, which is just peanuts. This is the reason that GPUs already dominate litecoin mining, and that ASICs being produced soon is a certainty.

You do need to look at the time between the transaction and the present, to make sure that it hasn't already been spent, but that's presumably much better than having to look at the whole block chain.

Also, it appears that the price moved in the same direction at the same time on both MTGOX and Bitstamp: 
Wouldn't that imply that the spike was for some other reason, since flight from MTGOX would drive the price lower on other exchanges?
