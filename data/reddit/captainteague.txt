Assuming the same number of transactions. 8MB blocks will do that in roughly 8 hrs.
No minimum amount to open channel.
No routing and route finding. P2P it is.
Centralization you say. Mining fee earned should be able to buy you storage I say.
What if LN nodes stop and some crisis or panic make everyone close channels?

Ladies and Gentlemen, I present you Bitcoin Cash. It is time to come out of your bubble and look at BCH. Feasible and Practical. Bitcoin is virtually useless now and is a good store of value.
Open your eyes, a few Influential people (devs and exchange owners etc.) wanted to get rich and stay rich and thus this Bitcoin Core is original Bitcoin propaganda. Segwit is Bullsh!t, it is not even complete.
Bitcoin Cash can mine 8MB blocks. Thousands of transactions get mined very quickly.

if the chain splits and we can use coins on both chain ... why isn't the demand for BTC increasing?
