Life is full of mistakes. Everyone 'knew' it was going to pop at 5K. So someone just spent 4950 dollars without due diligence.
That same person just needs to chill out and trust the process.  Did they buy bitcoin to make a quick buck or are they invested in it as a future technology? If you're buying bitcoin to flip it everytime it moves, you need to sell drugs or something else
Also, you should only invest money you can afford to lose, bitcoin or not, any investment.  Anyone with 5500 in the bank who bought a 5K bitcoin wasn't meant for this life anyway

As I understand...
Before, BTC split into BCH and BTC. If you had 3 BTC, you had 3 BTC and 3 BCH. 
Either piece of the fork had the chance to take off. Even if you held, BCH is worth like 300 bucks and that'd have been 900 free dollars. This is why the price of BTC is rising right now, people are pumping before the fork. 
Coinbase never gave anyone their BTC. They are holding it. Some people say this is a scam, that Coinbase sold all of the BCH when it was high and is buying it back cheaper. other people say Coinbase is holding everyone's BCH until it's worthless.
If you take your BTC off of Coinbase before the November fork, you will get your split coins right away and you can decide what to do with them, sell, hodl, whatever. I just got a Nano hardware wallet to move everything off Coinbase before the fork so I can get my money asap.

It's supply and demand. It'll sort itself out. 
The less people who provide the service, the more they can charge in fees. Ticketmaster is a good example. 
When every bank and every website and every store start accepting crypto because it break into the mainstream, the amount of companies converting will increase and in order for them to compete with one another, fees will drop. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:58:56
Once it dips, it's even dumber to sell. Why would you buy something for 4300 and then sell it for less immediately?

Think about this, right now when a panic happens, miners sell their riches to get out quick.  
After 2020 when mining becomes more difficult, the volatility will slow down. Scarcity will begin to outweigh other factors and when all the BTC are mined, holy shit, that's going to be a crazy day in bitcoin

@_date: 2017-10-20 17:49:02
is a good sub for questions, there are a lot of great articles and comments on the fork.
Forks work like this. This is how Bitcoin Cash worked.
BTC wanted to split. So if you had one BTC, you jhad one BTC and one BCH after the split. It was be up to you and the market to decide which coin is stronger. 
If you have your coins on an exchange such as Coinbase, they are the holder of your private key on your wallet.  It's up to them to distribute your BCH. As of right now, Coinbase still has not distributed BCH to users.  The value started at 1100/each and is now 331/each.  Coinbase users lost 700 per BCH because Coinbase was slow to act.  Rumors that Coinbase sold all the BCH at 1100 and is waiting until it's $5/each to buy it back and distribute are all over.  
If you pulled your BTC off the exchange into a hardware wallet before the fork, you could determine when you got your BCH because you had your private key and all the power. 
People are buying a lot of BTC right now because they know they will get Bitcoin Gold and B2X after the next two forks and they want the "free" coins.  They are selling their altcoins (ETH, LTC, etc) and pumping money into BTC. That is why it is rising so quickly (that and the market, and increased press, and Brexit, and Venezuela, and Trump and other stuff.) 
My advice is to keep saving and on December 1st, after the fork dust has settled, buy your first fraction when it dips.  Mining will be cut in half in 2020 as I said before, there are a finite amount of Bitcoin and once the supply of freshly mined coins is halved, we're going to the moon. 
The best time to buy Bitcoin was two years ago, the second best time is right now. 
Also, my advice is worthless, do what you want. I'm not a financial adviser, I'm just a guy on the internet.

Every single investment in the world is more valuable to someone who can invest more than $1500.  
My advice is squirrel away as much cash as you can and then when the split happens and it's November and the price drops as the whales dump their new BTC they only bought for the fork, buy the dip and ride the wave.

But you don't have 6,000 to put in, so you're nothing will double to nothing.  
If you buy a little at a time, you can average your cost.  If you bought LTC at 90 bucks, that was dumb in the short term but long term, I see a $500 LTC so it's not all bad news.  If you bought a few more when it dipped to 45, a $63 LTC could turn your holdings into a profit. 
After 2020, mining will be halved and stability as well as price will go up.  Just chip away at it until you have a whole one before 2020. Get in before 2020 and you're good.
