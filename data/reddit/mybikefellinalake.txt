Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:54:27
The creator said so? You'll never see btc stock at 0.00000. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:45:20
Same man, same
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:43:14
You make me feel better 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:59:06
Fuck it, we're all fucked 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:51:55
"hey send me money and I'll donate it for you" lolol Jesus reddit
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:43:11
Unless you sold at 17,700 and bought back in at 13,900 like an absolute boss
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:51:46
Holy fuck. Btc:0.00000 will never happen. The coins are lost. It will be like 0.0002 because of the lost coins. They may not be worth anything usd. But the stock amount of Btc will never hit 0.00000
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:45:45
It can't hit 0.00000 that's a fact. Sorry
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:18:17
Nothing, but im also not asking for money. 90% of charities are complete bullshit anyways. Most of the money will go Into pockets of ceo's
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:52:46
Read the next comment dude. Ur really not getting this and it's sad. Btc will never hit 0.00000 on stocks. Because of the lost coins. It may not be worth usd.. But Btc won't ever be 0.0000. Maybe 0.002 but not all zeros. Holy. Fuck. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:01:40
OMFG.... How this has gone over your head is beyond me. I'm not talking about failing or winning. Bitcoin can never hit 0.0000 because some coins still exist. They are lost. Forever. As the creator said lost coins are a donation to the cause. Holy fuck. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:03:37
I do it erday
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:32:50
It won't ever be absolutely zero. Holy fuck
@_date: 2018-09-03 11:43:34
Then do it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:20:06
0 what? The price for one bitcoin will never be 0.00000 that's all
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:45:33
It will never be at 0.00000, you will never see btc:0.00000 ever. I'm not talking about value or trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:39:31
Tell that to the other dude harassing me haha
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:34:58
So you can't source anything contradicting my original post? Okay bye
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:03:53
Out of what? My free money? 
@_date: 2018-09-16 23:15:41
Didn't read past the first sentence because I see that you cannot source info thag contradicts op. Yea didn't think so, it's your own echo chamber until you can do so bud. Have fun! 
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:14:58
But it isn't more effecient right now. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 07:28:46
So you cannot answer a simple question? Great have a good one man. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 19:43:50
Just me? Maybe you wanna go back and see who said names first? 
@_date: 2018-09-18 06:24:41
So is 43k, one million? Can you just answer yes or no? Because u said 1million times faster. So if you could just clear that up. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:53:08
Lol okay bud. I haven't made one claim other than what the chart above shows. I'm sorry you're ignorant, emotional and too fucking dumb to provide your own source. Take her ez bud
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:14:33
Ask fucking anyone. Even people in the thread agree it can't be zero
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:52:16
Lol I'm sorry you're so upset by this. Bitcoin will never ever reach 0.000 go make an ask reddit thread. It just wont
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:21:55
Then Google it and learn. You won't make money anymore
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:19:32
Bitcoin can never go to zero, just so ya know 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:54:45
I didn't read anything you said because bitcoin will never be 0.0000 ever. Ask whoever you need to. It won't be
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:51:48
Lol jeeeesus. Bitcoin will never see 0.000 end of story my dude
@_date: 2018-09-17 01:34:41
Hahahaha I stopped reading after your first sentence where you contradicted your original statement. Also calling yourself wrong. Bye buddy
@_date: 2018-09-17 03:01:18
Lol just give it up man, nobody's reading your shit
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:01:59
OMFG.... How this has gone over your head is beyond me. I'm not talking about failing or winning. Bitcoin can never hit 0.0000 because some coins still exist. They are lost. Forever. As the creator said lost coins are a donation to the cause. Holy fuck. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:32:34
U didn't say no demand you said bitcoin dropping to 0
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:32:30
I like how you assume I'm lazy when I'm just calling shit out haha, sorry I hurt your feelings bud
@_date: 2018-09-16 23:14:39
Yeaaa except that's not what most people use. Why do you think people are dumping their 1080's on eBay used from mining lol its not like they could only use asics. Sorry you are so butt hurt you gotta get all emotional and call people names bud. Maybe you need to go outside if someone's statement upsets you thag much haha, kinda sad man
@_date: 2018-09-19 19:51:29
Dope. Hopefully u see what I meant tho
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:21:39
Yea, I know all of this. My only point was it won't ever hit 0.00 and it's hilarious that people think it's possible. Look at all these people calling me names when they're wrong. I. Love. It. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 23:15:06
Wait so can you not give sources to Coontradict the OP? Okay cool, didn't think so 
@_date: 2018-09-16 19:39:21
They say it is tho... 
@_date: 2018-09-16 21:48:50
You responded to me talking to another person. It's all irrelevant. Look at the OP... if u wanna be right about soemthing I'm sure theres a relevant thread for you 
@_date: 2018-09-16 20:25:15
The federal government 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:29:56
Lol no kid. It's not. Ask someone smarter than you. Tweet whoever you have to, to find out you're wrong
@_date: 2018-09-17 02:24:42
So you cannot source any claim defending or opposing op? Great
@_date: 2018-09-16 23:17:10
Fucking source it then dude. Show some proof. Or just down vote anyone who can disprove you. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 21:43:18
It's neither here nor there. Source that bitcoin uses more enegery than usd which is what the entire argument was about. Which nobody can source. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:26:17
Yea but you will never on a stock exchange or anywhere see btc:0.000 even if we value it for 0.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:08:27
Because it will never be worth 0.0000000. Read what Satoshi said. Every lost bitcoin just adds to its value like a donation. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:39:14
But it'll never be 0,that was my point 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:26:36
People had these posts in 2014 as well. And in 2015. But look what happened.. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:31:37
Prove it
@_date: 2018-09-16 17:49:21
Do you think it's easier to plug something into the internet and wall socket. Or get ink, build a machine, hire ppl to print money. Package money, distribute it in cars and planes, then take old money and burn it. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 20:20:22
Yea but theres more than 21 million gold. It isn't capped. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 23:26:16
Because they're less effective and the new Gen are coming... Dude you can literally make profit with a 1070. Do you even mine? Wtf is making a profit anyways, my last apartment had electricity built into the rent so everything mined was free profit you ignorant fuck. But no, you're super smart and know everything there is, fucking dipshit now a days man. Go on the mining subs and ask what coins to mine. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:31:32
So then you're wrong. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 02:33:48
The answer is always yes, because I was always talking about the OP. Because this is a thread about the OP, in a forum about the OP. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 19:38:22
Lolol asics don't make up the majority of computers used in bitcoin. Don't be ignorant 
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:12:44
So you can't answer the question still? I love how you expect other people to admit their wrong when you can't even admit it. What's closer to 1 million. 5 or 45k. I'll let your autistic ass decide 
@_date: 2018-09-16 19:13:02
Mother fucker then source it? Oh wait, u can't, all u do is talk shit lol. You're a fucking idiot with no proof. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:21:54
Then do it? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:17:13
How pissed would u be if it doubled next week 
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:09:53
But dollars are supposed to be backed by gold... 
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:26:20
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:11:29
Fallacy fallacy, invalid point try again. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 22:26:15
So you cannot source something on the contrary to my op? Okay bye
@_date: 2018-09-19 05:06:40
Lol or is it a million
@_date: 2018-09-16 17:51:57
What numbers? 
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:21:36
Lol we already have all of that bud. They aren't bitcoin Computers. Just regular computers that can mine. That's a dumb argument. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:01:34
OMFG.... How this has gone over your head is beyond me. I'm not talking about failing or winning. Bitcoin can never hit 0.0000 because some coins still exist. They are lost. Forever. As the creator said lost coins are a donation to the cause. Holy fuck. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:12:21
Exactly. Now you get it
@_date: 2018-09-26 20:04:01
You realize John McAfee is a attention seeking moron who eats literally human shit right? 
@_date: 2018-09-17 01:00:07
Uhh.. Yes you can..
I'm sorry, I mean, of course you can you stupid peice of shit. That's the whole point of bitcoin. Asics just do it faster. You can mine bitcoin with an android you ignorant sack of shit
@_date: 2018-09-16 21:23:02
Yet we still maintain there was enough gold to support the economy which there isn't 
@_date: 2018-09-16 23:52:26
Hahaha just ignores everything else. You can have a farm of 1080's too bud. It happens. Not that I would expect you to know, you literally don't know anything about mining besides the word asic. Peace out bud
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:22:05
Lol it's supposed to be... 
@_date: 2018-09-16 01:58:57
I'm fucking with ya bud lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:06:27
Okay great. But btc:0.0000 wouldn't show up on screen. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 17:59:44
Well I asked you a question. Like a normal person. Then you just didn't answer it and down voted me. So idk what you want bud. The numbers very clearly support the title of op's post. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 00:59:45
That the OP. Of the entire fucking post. Is probably correct. Do you agree or disagree... It's what the entire post is about buddy. Cmon, u can do this. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:07:16
Yea. Don't. Just put the money in bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:03:52
How?! It uses 183m and gold mining uses more. Whatr you reading. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 17:50:02
Go to the federal reserve and look at their power meter
@_date: 2018-09-15 21:03:30
I just got mine tatood on me, and one of the numbers is switched and only I know which ones. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:06:53
Btc:0.0000 will never show up on any screen and be correct. Ever. It's impossible. That's all, take her easy
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:09:31
Because the bitcoin numbers are lower Tha  the other numbers.... 
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:53:27
Lol my point exactly? 
@_date: 2018-09-19 00:31:54
Hahaha makes the math to make himself right. Moron you were off by hundreds of thousands, I was off by under 100k haha. Fucking retard trying to be right will do anything 
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:32:25
So they were a million times stronger? Oh my bad
@_date: 2018-09-17 03:42:01
Great so no sources still
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:20:04
He thinks he gets a lot more than he probably does lol. Making a lot of assumptions over there
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:06:46
U support bcash then go to the competition to vent? Some could say that's crying on the wrong shoulder. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 01:45:08
Haha pathetic move being completely wrong and trying to save yourself
@_date: 2018-08-09 20:12:37
Lol my hands are stronger? Dude you belong in r/iamverybadass with that shit. Go be a little whiteknight in bcash's sub
@_date: 2018-08-09 20:42:04
Yea no shit, ur not bad ass because you don't sell your coins sooner... You aren't the only one who can hold coins.. You went from Iamverybadass to r/whoosh. I already told you to take her ez, u can stop responding now bud
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:40:09
It can't drop to zero. Too many people have lost thousands upon thousands of bitcoins. Think about it
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:44:18
You sound soft as hell haha. I'm calling him out on his bullshit. Keep all the bcashers off this sub with their drama. It's that simple. Sorry you can't handle anything that isn't remotely uncivil. It is the internet. Take her ez bud
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:14:53
Always test man.. Always. I still do with coin base and I've used it for a year. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 15:41:40
And now you came to the other side to cry about it. The irony is too strong 
@_date: 2018-05-30 17:37:06
"when did I insult you" so the question now is are you stupid or can YOU not read 
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:00:14
Yea and if the dollar reaches nothing, and bitcoin is still at 7k. Who the fuck would cash out their stack for almost nothing. You'd just be losing bitcoin which actually has value, you could still go to Europe and cash it out for their fiat and have money again 
@_date: 2018-08-09 18:17:59
Either way, he created a shitty community now he's outcasted? Deal with it
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:23:53
Lol everyone else? Dude let it go
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:36:10
And he was right. It went completely over your head. So just let it go 
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:54:06
But u still said it.. U only apologized to seem more credible and less butt hurt. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 00:24:18
No no no. A .Com is what Satoshi ACTUALLY meant to invision. It's what closely match his white paper the best. Maybe you didn't read  /s
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:25:42
Literally just you and 1 other person. Maybe you're the narcissist 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:10:37
I'll take 1 bitcoin please 
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:53:43
Way to talk out of ur ass man. Plenty of apartments have electricity included in rent
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:19:19
I know about the sidebar info, I was kinda hoping it could start a discussion with different options, or some nice dude could answer a couple questions for me, thanks 
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:10:02
And just sketchy Cuz of the big fees
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:31:39
My fee for 1000 dollars is 14 bucks on coinbase. How are you paying? Debit card? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:22:42
Big risk big reward. Some of us don't have that much money to 'diversify'. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:10:04
All good homie
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:37:03
U never need to. It's fdic insured and you can withdraw them into your bank account for another 1.99 fee. So quit ur bullshit 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:36:29
It's not 10k yet haha 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:33:06
Stocks and because he's an idiot 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:01:08
It does but okay 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:27:30
You sound so serious
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:00:13
Short it and screenshot it or you're a puss
@_date: 2018-11-29 00:40:03
Because he doesn't believe what he's saying. He's just spouting bullshit. If you know this will then make the most out of it. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:01:11
Here's the thing. Nobody's angry. You're just being called out for making dumbass statements and assumptions 
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:49:10
GtaV easily has 1 million plus. Especially including rage engine and euphoria physics and then game code. Some think it's about 50+ million. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:03:04
Hahaha oh boy got self conscious and added a Lil edit. That's cute bud
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:02:13
Yet you're pulling past prices out to justify your statements. Okay okay. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 16:05:01
So you think bitcoin will only drop from here? Great, let's remember this moment and see if you're right. Because I'd be willing to out money on you being wrong
@_date: 2018-11-13 21:11:35
Can't be a pedo and married I guess 
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:13:38
Nope 
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:42:22
Hahaha that's not irony bud. Jesus fuck. Even if it was true. It's still not irony. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 17:50:21
Depending on where you live. Capital gains in my state is 25% under a year. Where as income tax would be a little less. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 21:11:12
Sick, shill that eos even though it's a scam. Do it man
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:32:00
Haha bud you have way too much time on your hands, example one and two are in your last messages
@_date: 2018-11-08 00:21:48
Pyramid scheme confirmed 
@_date: 2018-03-17 16:02:47
So why are you shitting on this guy? You seem like an old grumpy man, get off these subs and grow up, I can't imagine being in crypto and lurking subs since 2011 and still being this jaded. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 20:00:02
Nah, I'd never give up 50% of my wages. Idc if there isn't a pothole in the city. Or Healthcare. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:20:15
Idk how bad of a call out does it have to be before you edit your statement. See idc so I won't edit. But clearly someone's got some feelings towards the argument here haha
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:27:06
Explain the high risk part... Because I'd argue it has the lowest risk. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 18:50:45
No way ur losing half of ur income to tax... So if you make 40k a year, u only get 20? 
@_date: 2019-01-14 07:47:39
Nah it's so he doesn't have to pay capital gains. Hell still pay tax on it though because in assuming he has not life outside this and it's his main source of income. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 19:16:18
But we cant exchange coins for bitcoin? 
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:59:09
Yea.. They do lol
@_date: 2019-01-22 21:52:57
And? That's not how this would work at all. It's impossible for everyone to withdrawl everything from banks. Everyone knows this. You can still pay people back. That's how credit works. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:44:38
Yea lemme just put all my money into bitcoin. Way more stable 
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:09:18
You are 100% wrong and you can set a reminder for 2 months and admit it yourself. Or just keep being stubborn. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 01:33:33
Where'd the under 50 number come from? I exchange hundreds of dollars worth of coins at a time
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:41:33
Okay so you're right it'll never go up, smart a/
@_date: 2019-01-02 23:50:54
Take ur coins out of an exchange 
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:36:38
Or you can just make 900 at your job in less than a month ? 
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:41:16
Fun fact, it'll go back up and you'll be wrong again. See fun facts are fun
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:35:27
To which I responded. That's why medium articles are trash haha
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:52:10
It's not a particular investment. It's crypto. So it either will go up or it won't. He says it will. You argued. You are wrong. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:57:30
Is that how you learned to read. Haha Jesus man if you're gunna talk shit, have it make sense. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:11:20
Even so it's still dumb. He coulda bought now and made more 
@_date: 2018-07-12 21:55:46
Cuz it's a funny meme
@_date: 2018-07-28 00:15:54
I'm sure you would bud. I'm sure you can also google
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:12:32
K. But not buying at the lowest is dumb. Nothing you can do. But objectively it's dumb
@_date: 2018-07-27 23:15:32
So you don't think androids have viruses... And you work with computers? Hmm
@_date: 2018-07-30 23:47:26

Just curios how isn't it a fork and altcoin? 
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:06:54
They'll probably have higher fees... I mean how does Binance make money
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:50:56
Nah PayPal just upped the fees. Nobody's wants that shit anymore. I'd rather use lite coin and wait 5 minutes 
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:24:51
Local exchanges
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:06:54

Haha look how triggered you are when u get called out on bullshit. Wow, feel bad for you bud. Have fun buying groceries with land and bitcoin haha. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:40:52
The 60 million figure wasn't based off of the same article. You can waste the time if ya want to though. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:41:03
Dude got lucky as fuck. Moving ur shit around to all these exchanges. That's how people get fucked. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 07:43:10
Your the only one that thinks that way. Just take a chill pill bud
@_date: 2018-12-18 03:47:49
That just sounds like forcing your friend to buy btc. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:35:50

@_date: 2018-12-03 01:55:57
You have no clue where I got my sources lol just give it up bud
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:48:05
Nobody is trolling, I'm just saying have fun buying groceries with bitcoin. You still need cash. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:55:45
Have fun paying rent when u sold all ur dollars
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:47:25
You literally just said invest in soemthing valuable like land hahaha smh man. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:37:53
There's only 60 mil a year in gold AND silver wasted from discarding e-waste. That's chump change compared to gold miners and bitcoin volume. Nice try tho. That's like saying you lose 5 bucks a year, it's nothing. Furthermore a gold ring would power thousands of computers, computers need around 0.0005 ounces of gold. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:44:52
Ur so cool
@_date: 2018-12-08 19:02:05
Buy land instead of hodl cash. Land isnt worth anything
But nah, Im an idiot
@_date: 2018-12-08 19:01:29
Have fun paying 10% more every week for groceries and rent you fucking idiot haha. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:37:45
Coinbase absolutely tells you about the fees before hand man. Also this is all such a low amount of money, no platform is going to try and accommodate for people withdrawing 2 dollars. It's pointless honestly. Try sending 2 bucks on PayPal, it'll tax you too. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:30:45
Nah just an accurate one. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:30:02
How is making fake bills success? Anyone can buy funny money hahaha, idiot
@_date: 2018-12-02 22:48:01
So where does it mention that a billion dollars in gold is wasted a year? Find that statistic for literally any credibility to what you're saying, instead of napkin math to prove your point. No shit we've sold more smartphones. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:41:01
It doesn't matter. You don't live a life in society where the only money you have is bitcoin. Not possible yet. Sorry 
@_date: 2018-12-08 19:07:37
What you need is a new hobby bitch, all you do is post in bitcoin. Get a life bud
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:55:41
I don't believe you. But it doesn't matter. Right now, using bitcoin for everyday stuff is dumb. And you're dumb for doing that. Let me explain why, bitcoin has dropped 90% from a year ago, constantly dropping. Cash hasn't. Now, I like crypto, but I've pulled out, and I'm waiting for a bottom. Whereas you just keep losing money because apperantly you pay for everything in your life, with bitcoin. Financially you're making a dumb move all because you like crypto, stubbornness maybe? Not sure, but any logical person in the world would agree this isn't smart while it's dropping so fast and it's so volitile. Now I'm sure you're gunna disagree and give me a whole speech. I don't really care, because holding btc and using for everyday purchases is dumb. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 00:07:28
This is literally a disclaimer at the end of your article
"however, neither Kitco Metals Inc. nor the author can guarantee such accuracy"
Its just a bunch of napkin math, but published lol. But whatever I'm done debunking the bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:19:39
I've never seen someone lie so bad to get out of something
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:06:28
Prove it
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:47:13
Wow I can't even imagine how hard you had to try to come up with an excuse to explain why this is dumb. I mean you included the small amount of gold inside a computer? The RECYCLED gold that computers use? It's barely worth anything. That's an idiotic reasoning. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 22:03:23
Hahaha dude you're not going to do napkin math to debunk a number that I gave you coming from people who did actual math. sorry. You're just way off, maybe try and research instead of continually making up numbers based off a percentage. 60 million a year in gold AND silver is wasted from e-waste. Those are the numbers. Not  a fucking billion.
