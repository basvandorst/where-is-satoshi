b-b-but u/jstolfi said LN is impossible! Did my based computer science professor lie?

r/btc is EXTREMELY toxic and deluded. This place isn't nearly as bad despite the exaggaration I made in my post. But this recent tantrum is some high level irrationality.

grovel? They met, talked and decided to submit to the community's and core's will to get segwit. Yet you fucktards are still whining.
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:29:03
Is it incorrect to say that segwit + 2mb hardfork would increase our ability to process transactions more than just segwit?
1-2 years to coordinate a hardfork to change one variable seems like an overstatement to me?I feel like segwit2mb would gain support among miners and companies  very quickly if core backed this path forward.

Bitcoin is quite simpler than the fiat system.

I'd love that even more. I just want something that both sides would agree on though... My standards have been lowered significantly. I'll take fucking anything, except the BU garbage of course.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:03:03
Yes. And we wanted segwit all this time. They talked together and decided they want it too. So what's all the complaining about?
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:07:56
I didn't express an opinion on the (unannounced) proposal. I expressed my opinion on the idiocy of this community.
@_date: 2017-05-18 00:05:28
Yes please. Don't forget to buy my BU shitcoin tokens after the fork happens.

They're not allowed to meet? Who's the authoritarian scum now? People like are you a fucking disgrace to the community.

If the retarded inbreds on both sides of the debate stopped calling everyone 'a shill', that would be a nice step forward. I make a new reddit account every month or so for privacy's sake, but I wouldn't expect a subhuman like you, who jumps to conclusions backed by nothing, to understand that.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:53:45
People here brainwashed themselves in their hatred of the other side to believe anything that other side wants is horrible.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:47:49
Because it actually combines a great idea(segwit) with a good idea(2mb HF).
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:49:34
This is obviously not directed to you?
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:09:46
Agreed, we just have to wait and see, no point jumping to conclusions like people are doing.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:51:06
Fuck your UASF. Fork off and fuck off, bitcoin doesn't need extremists of either side.
