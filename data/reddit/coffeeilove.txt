There is not any reason to assume "the real" Satoshi wrote that. No one even knows if the guy actually exists. Even if he did write it, it does not give us any more information about the website. Any discussion about this thus doesn't make any sense.

An attack of Meltdown and Spectre is theoretically possible, these flaws exist already for a long time. But attacks like Meltdown or Spectre being used "in the wild" have never been seen. There need to be very specific circumstances for this attack to succeed. Now that it has gained so much attention fixes will follow. It is being overhyped currently just as with the millenniumbug 20 years ago.

No. I find the hardware backdoor story fascinating. But with JS you cannot simply read all cached passwords by just letting someone visit a website. The browser limits your possibilities with JS, it won't let you access cached info only but for the particular website you are visiting. What you likely mean is an official website that is compromised with e.g. a JS injection, that could lead to a dangerous situation when your data is stored in cache.
