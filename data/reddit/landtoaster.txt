This often gets brought up by Maxwell's critics. But IMO it's actually a sign of a rational mind. He had an opinion, saw evidence to the contrary and changed his mind. Then there are people who take things on faith and won't change their minds even when presented with evidence that they are wrong.

You forgot to multiply by 100 to get in percents. If you did that it'll be around 4%. 
Here's a graph that makes it easier to see:

If we talk about price inflation then we'll need to look at a country that has suffered from hyper inflation like Zim 7-8 years ago. After all bitcoin has lost 80% of it's value in the last 18 months.

It is unexpected because bitcoin usually trades at a discount there. Now it's more expensive than all the other exchanges. That indicates that people are buying btc to withdraw because they can't get their money out in fiat. It also indicates a higher risk of trading there. 
This is similar to  what happened with Gox where the price traded at a $100 premium after Gox's problems with fiat withdrawals.

To spend or merely view the balance? If you just want to view the balance then bookmark the link to your wallet address from another block explorer. Like btc.blockr.io. 
If you want to be able to spend your bitcoins then pretty much any desktop or mobile wallet can be used to import or sweep your private key and spend your bitcoins. mycelium, electrum, armory, bitcoin core, multibit etc.

Will it? My understanding is after the next halving inflation will still be around 5% for quite a while. Which OECD country has an inflation rate that high? Most are in deflation.

Bitfinex must be happy. They are the ones that got hacked but people are hating on OKCoin. This subreddit has gotten so biased.

What do you mean *more* evidence? He has no evidence at all! Just bullshit. 
Too much fighting going on in this subreddit these days. One day they are piling on lukejr. The next on the largest bitcoin exchange in the world and now on a whole lot of other core developers.

The majority of devs are against it. It is Gavin that needs to build consensus not the other way around.
