In the US the president does not have a say in monetary policy. The US keeps those powers separated so that monetary policy can be independent from political agendas.

So theres no chance that FB was concerned by the enormous amounts of ICO scams advertising on their platform?
@_date: 2018-09-11 00:43:29
Did you even read the article? The author gave no reasons why keeping 1% of its reserves in Bitcoin would make any difference except that they could then have a reason to mine bitcoin with nuclear power plants.

Someone with that large of a position probably isn't going to be using margin. Unwinding such a large position in the markets would require assistance from the exchanges so that bitcoin didn't collapse in the process. I doubt the trading data from the exchanges is going to show whats happening.

Yeah but if you filtered out all the fake crypto news how would you know about all the strategic partnerships being misrepresented, which shitcoin partnered with an unverified Chinese government agency, or news of adoption increases?

Yeah fuck roads, electrical grids, the internet infrastructure on which your bitcoin exists, agencies that regulate the pollution in your drinking water.

The president can affect the Fed's policy with the budget, but he can't tell the chairperson what to do. This independence protects the US from problems where a president could print money to achieve their campaign promises when they start running out of money or don't want to raise taxes. Venezuela is an excellent example of what happens when there is no separation of these powers.

You can't touch it either sitting in a prison cell for tax evasion. But who cares if my fiat wages get garnished as long as my precious bitcoin isn't touched.
@_date: 2018-09-11 00:26:10
I'd imagine that regulation would prevent it from functioning like Tether.

3 steps to silence a FUDder:
1. Repeat that Wall Street is spreading FUD
2. Make sure they know that they will be crying when bitcoin is $100k
3. Tell them that they've been warned

I didn't know bitcoin's 3.87% inflation rate means its deflationary, what would you call the USD's 2%?

Because manipulation only goes one way, right?

Bitfinex BTC premium has been steadily rising the last 2 weeks since they suspended both fiat deposits AND withdrawals. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 15:02:33
Fiat withdrawals aren't processing either. They keep claiming withdrawals are up but the $500-$1000 bitfinex btc premium is proof nobody can get fiat out.
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:28:45
Exactly! Tether dropped to $0.90 when they lost their banking connections. Its pretty neat that the moment they lost all access to capital the tether supply started to increase exponentially, coinciding perfectly with the start of the 2017 bull run!

Is there a quality source for the JPM silver thing? Like one that isn't a bullion dealer or zerohedge? 
@_date: 2018-10-16 05:25:48
I dunno man. I struggle to find a youtube video of the author of "gold and silver digest" as conclusive evidence. I can't find any market news about it that isn't coming from a gold bug.

I'll bite. Imagine if political affiliation was not apparent in twitter users. Would there be any difference in the people who are "ejected" from the platform? Perhaps being banned from twitter has less to do with whatever labels people choose to identify with in their bio, and more to do with violating community guidelines by posting offensive material.

Mcafee marketed computer viruses of the 90's as catastrophic doomsday scenarios that could only be prevented if you bought HIS antivirus software. He went on tv and hyped shit up way out of proportion to sell people shit

Really? Like you didn't make a single comment? The mods were actually so active in this community that they frantically read the name of every new subscriber in order to catch every racist 4channer that may appear?


Oh shit, you mind reader! How did you possibly know that I was going to ask you to list some historical communist leaders? Oh wait

The only people who would profit off of a bitcoin etf would be the company issuing it. The management fees associated with balancing it would eat up everything. Google leveraged etf decay

Did you seriously just compare the horrors and abuse that African Americans in the US have historically suffered to not being able to spend your fucking bitcoin? That aside, Iran is a legitimate global terrorist threat and you want to give them fucking money???

Why would you want total anonymity with the other party unless you're doing something illegal

Right, because miners who are stealing electricity or getting it for almost nothing in their countries are going to invest in a fucking wind farm to reduce their carbon footprint.

Oh man, you are either an expert troll or insanely delusional. I applaud the effort at least to come up with that.

Woah woah woah. Someone who clearly has no personal investment or bias in this went out of their way to make a 30 cell spreadsheet with unverifiable data points, and you're just gonna question the validity like that?

No, I will not read a fucking trash blog from BitMexico about why China's government should allow crypto.

I have a feeling theres a good deal of cherry picking in this data. Also the "Banking System" deals with a few more transactions than Bitcoin currently.
@_date: 2018-07-04 06:42:01
Banks do a little more than payment transactions.

Would another graph comparing bitcoin's current energy consumption to all the cars in the world answer your question?
