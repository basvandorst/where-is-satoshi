a rumor going around says that he's sitting at $445 with a huge buy order

Much appreciated

are you retarded... the 2 articles are not the same lol altho i agree that the title is "editorialising" it a bit 
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:29:09
I agree 100%.. Directpool is for sure helping make the hashrate be more distributed among the public pools and the giving back initiative is just great on its own... 
@_date: 2014-04-09 05:19:24
nope... but you just did prove that you're either a stalker or a stalker... and your still wrong lol creep.

It really does seem like something's up over at btcguild. They took out PPS while they have over 6ph of hashing power... they must be going thru some turbulent times or luck. Either way, PPLNS is the safe way to do it imo and directpool is full pplns
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:07:31
It's great that this pool is pplns only cuz pps payment method has "hot wallet" security issues. Even BTCguild took notice of your pool i guess check it out:  from btcguild's news section
@_date: 2014-03-15 19:01:09
+1 you are right
@_date: 2014-04-15 11:14:54
that just happened like a few hrs ago on the eve of passover
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:05:02
I think that's a fair assumption...
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:30:56
i haven't seen Directpool people say they will prevent the 51% atk... all they said is they want to prevent any pool from every reaching close to it by giving the mining commmunity the option to sspread out... so that the over all hashrate of the network gets more distributed amongst public pools

"As for now, one thing is clear: Bitcoin is not banned in China."
@_date: 2014-03-21 20:52:15
I think what they mean is that they want to help prevent 51% attack by helping redistribute the over all hashing power of the bitcoin network. But most important part that i took away from this is that this is the ONLY pool that wants to help the bitcoin community grow!! That's HUGE.

I bet Google has quietly been working a secret bitcoin related project!!
@_date: 2014-04-06 22:13:01
I think they're doing a "all premine" on their own servers and handing it out to their people... i doubt 51% atk would be a concern for them
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:07:39
I'm Xatoshi.
@_date: 2014-04-06 19:58:36
The article doesn't indicate that its far fetched.. from what i read it commends them for getting scotcoin going
@_date: 2014-03-15 18:22:26
Good bitcoin pool setup...Looks beautiful
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:10:51
i'm mining on it now, easy setup and all. They did say the will provide a lot more details of the donations and the giving part.. this is far from just another pool bro
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:24:46
Thank you Overstock for being cool. I just started shopping at Overstock today with Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 20:56:39
By giving miners the option to mine on a pool that's just as good in service as bigger pools.. didn't you read the article? geez
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:23:39
You might be using the wrong command line. Contact the pool thru their "Help" button. They respond rather quickly.

"Story updated: PBOC has not yet made any official announcements. Reports suggest that the Chinese exchanges are receiving notices from the PBOC. More on this story will be posted as it develops."
I think there's still hope..maybe they didn't shut it down just yet.. who knows for sure wth is going on over in china but my guess is that shit is bad
