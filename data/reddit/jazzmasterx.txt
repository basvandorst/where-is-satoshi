An old Bitcoin proverb says: “The best time to buy bitcoins was 6 years ago. The second best time is today.”   ;-)

I don't remember bitcoins at $130.00 the last days... Last time was around October 2013.

Bitstamp and BTC-e?

Exactly my point. Banks will fight against Bitcoin, but if people allow payments in bitcoins without having to exchange them to dollars or euros or whatever, they'll become powerless.

Prices now around $95,00 / Bitcoin...
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:38:14
People wont listen to you here, but you're right. The ones who are here already have sold or are plain stupid. The other ones are trying to sell at any price right now!

You mean, that will be the last step before we have Bitcoin SEPAs comming our way...  :(

Had the same problem... had to sell at $120. Was lucky that I could buy at $72.
@_date: 2013-03-28 11:33:23
What will most likely happen is that at $100 there will be a lot of media attention. This means a lot of new people will want to buy bitcoins and prices will raise even faster. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:36:24
Sent mine in Dutch... no issue.
@_date: 2013-03-28 13:53:03
I believe the $100 cap will give Bitcoins a lot of media attention which will attract a lot of new buyers. And what caps will be reached then?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:52:40
We are in for the burst!
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:28:08
It all depends on the reason of the burst of the bubble. If the reason is that hackers found a way to reave Bitcoins, there wont be a comeback for the Bitcoin. If it is solely a stabilization of the market price with huge price drops, Bitcoins probably will be in for the long run with slow but steady price rises in the future.

Bitstamp is also down...
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:43:32
bitstamp as well
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:57:39
3 day's ago it was around 18.000 ... are we getting over the top already? Or is Mt. Gox just working harder now?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:31:08
@_date: 2013-04-03 11:52:50
Still not too late or will you be crying if they are $1000 and you didn't buy them today?
