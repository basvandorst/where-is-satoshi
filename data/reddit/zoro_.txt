virtual currency will never be popular in India. A virtual currency can be manipulated by those who have the technology AKA americans. We will not touch it atleast until we are sure that Bitcoin is fool proof with quantum computers

Do you think the protocol would be implemented on the Day one when quantum computers are created? It would take a decade or atleast 5 years to have these changes after they are created. Please remember this post when you guys find out that a govt had taken the advantage of this bug. I think the military already has the first functional quantum computer.

Im Indian, and what are you talking about bitcoin destroying quantum computer??

Bitcoin would fall flat the day quantum computers are used to generate bitcoins.

Tell me guys. If you are sure the algorithm which creates bitcoins cannot be broken by a quantum computer, buy this. My guess...bitcoin would stay for 10 years atmost
