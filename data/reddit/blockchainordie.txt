shiiiit. now back to almost 200. So that means, someone could have made something like 10x their money today...if I have put like 1K in the morning at 32, and sold at around 200...that would have been around 6k,,and then bought for 6k when it was 122, and sell now for 200...6*200= almost 10K..

Great explanation! That makes it very clear! 
ANy ideas regarding moving other ETH and LTC to gdax from coinbase? (sorry, I know this is a bitcoin forum, but just in case someone has done that before...)
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:36:12
I know these guys dont represent the whole crypto world, and maybe some of the mentioned guys are behind the pineapple fund that is doing some really good shiit, but I feel sad about the general attitude here. Ok they are quite young and it is very easy to lose oneself when one acquires a massive amount of money over a short time (I will probably have acted the same way, had I gotten millions in my 20s). But it's still unnerving to see a "hiphop" sort of mentality growing here, and they dont seem to see the irony in crying out leftist slogans  " decentralized money for all, fuck the banks, ..." while driving fancy cars and knowing 95% or so of the cryptowealth is controlled by less than 5% of the people in the crypto space. We are decrying wallstreet while we are creating a crazier trading philosophy (at least wall street doesnt trade on weekend and evenings ) and there is some control against price manipulation. I really hope this won't end like the hippy movement, which started with the lofty idea of bringing more consciousness/love/peace to the west but got hijacked by drugs/laziness/hypocrisy.  
I'm getting fed up, once I get my Lambo, I am out!������

Very good high level explanation! However,  I still don't understand how the distributed ledger aspect comes into play in the context of LN. I mean, how do transactions get verified or get into the ledger if they are done on a direct  peer to peer fashion,  what does minning mean in the LN context, etc...
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:40:53
gdax not cooperating...freezing all the time I try to get my deposit address :-(
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:03:02
Same here, burned 1 btc at 7.5k euro, it was actually he very lowest point. But I bought it back at 8.5k. Sell low, buy high, that's my principel!��
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:02:35
unrealized gains now 9.5K euro....but that was if I hodled....but but, stupid me, sold 1BTC, at 7.5Keuro, because that was the avg price I paid for my coins so far, and it was a break even point... but now that is like 3K euros lower than the current price.....Duuuuuh
And it doesn't end there... realizing I made a mistake, I tried to day trade to make up for the loss, bought at 8.1, sold at 8.5, bought at 8.3, sold at 8.9, bought at 8.5 sold at 9.3, etc... just to realize now that I have now only 0.5 btcs left...from original 2....didn't realize how stupid it was to do that, I mean, if you see something growing, you don't day trade, you keep and hold...
lesson learned, now I pray for a little bit of crash so that I can go back to my 2BTC, and forget about the last two days....I think with the change I have from the sales I will be able to buy maybe something around 1 to 1.2...so at least 0.3btc lost...and the stress and lack of sleep counts to at least 0.1 btc:-)..
but I think I learned my lessons, I will be a champion hodler, once I crawl myself back to the 2BTCs, all will be forgotten when I will have 100K by the end of the year :-)
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:07:06
and how come everyone is ignoring this? (2hrs since posted) or is it old news?
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:20:09
I was wondering, even if gdax covered the transaction fees and set it to high value, how come it is carried out almost instantaneously? I mean, doesn't it take 10 min to verify a given block of transactions on the average? (also looking at this  seems to suggest even much longer time. Of course, the very high values in the graph could be mainly to very low transaction fees)

total crypto market cap has decreased by something like 300B USD in just a couple of days. Craaaaazy... (If I remember correctly, it was more than 750B few days ago, now just 465)
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:01:26
really glad that you benefited from BTC! That being said, and I would like to remind you that I am a hodler myself, I think such a story have little substance in terms of lessons to be learned to others. Example similar story one could tell me: "Nice lottery story" where the protagonist bought a lottery ticket and won it and solved some financial problem of his own/family. I will still be happy for him, but that doesn't mean I will start believing in lottery.  I believe in blockchain and that it will drastically change/is changing our world. Ad bitcoin, being the first mover, has a huge headstart than others, and I hope it will remain for quite sometime since that will be to my advantage. But I think there is so much hype around crypto, and there is no way in hell we need 1000s of coins to do this or that, and most of them, say 95% are gonna plummet and die, and there is no guarantee that bitcoin won't be one of them.

Ok, finally managed to transfer 1Btc to gdax (fee:14USD). It took about 1 hour. Ahh, and now price has gotten a bit up, and my panic is a bit gone, I feel so tempted to keep it... let me wait a bit :-)
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:04:03
would be nice to have this done live. something like:
- one that is predicting the price for every day of the rest of the year, based on only the data set until right now (so no adjusting)
- one that is like above, but it is adjusting every day (i.e. the actual price of yesterday will be used than that of today, while in the first one, it is the price that was forcasted yesterday will be used even if it was wrong)  
- and some "fun" parameters like FOMO and FUD influence of the day (e.g. china bans minnning  equivalent to FUD = 0.2, every country bans minning, equivalent FUD = 1,  big bank guy says bitcoin is a digital gold  FOMO = 0.1, a statement from the  European union saying that it will replace the EURO with bitcoin FOMO=1.0, etc...)
and then we display all the three charts together :-)
Any volunteers to do this? I have some programming background (and did lots of monte carlo simulations some time back for my thesis work), but I have not done so in quite a long time. But with some help from active programmers, I can take on this project!
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:43:08
So basically the LN is somehow similar to what the exchanges like coinbase do, but done in a nicer and decentralised way?
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:19:17
congrats! Yes, that shit was crazy. Pure gambling, but as long as it worked for you! 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:20:48
I had my first experience of day trading the last couple of days, and the lesson I learned was that it is really very hard to play that game with crypto. But that being said, right now maybe the best time to do day trading, because it is wobbling up and down, not by that much but very cyclic trading happening (for example, at gdax, during the last 4 hours,  we had 3 cycles that has highs around 10.05K euros and lows of around 9.9K...so if one was to follow very closely, and invested say 1 btc to play with, he/she could have theoretically made around 400 euros. .... but still very risky game to play full time with a lot of cash
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:04:47
so a further dip when this hits the western media???
Does this mean the shutdown of all chinese exchanges? I have some invested in binance, does it gets affected? I mean, you can't use credit card or bank transfer, but only coin to coin exchange...
I was thinking of buying some btc because expecting it to ramp up, but now this is stopping me from doing so. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:57:07
I was referring to from gdax to ledger nano S, it finished in less than 30 seconds, I don't really understand it...
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:06:06
Thanks for the fast response! And nice to know that with faster transfer fees I can avoid the delay completely. So if I am interested in day trading, then the best option will be to leave some btc around on gdax for that purpose? say, something like 10-20% of my total holdings?
Also somehow related to gdax, it seems I can deposit only from my coin base BTC or Euro accounts. I have some litecoin and etherum as well. Is there an easy way to transfer them to gdax?
 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:12:52
I think I give it few hours, and if it keeps on plunging, I have to do it :-( ... the thing is, I have transferred it all into my ledger nano...so now to sell it, I have to get it back to an exchange like gdax, right?...I will also have to allocate some fee for the transfer fee, and transaction fee, right?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:38:34
Fantastic article! I have yet to read all of it, but it got me hooked, so I wanted to share asap.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:00:05
I saw it on binance. but now it is going down to hell... have gone from like 200 to 122 in few hours!
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:25:04
But how come? I mean, the story was that bch supports were selling btc and buying bch. But seems bch is hit even more in the last hr (8% down for btc vs 16% down for bch)
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:39:10
I noticed the same thing the other day on coinbase. I sold some when the price was around 16K (didn't exactly check the exact value for sale, the 16k was what was shown on the chart), and I tried to buy when the price hit around 12k (also on the chart), but I saw that the price asked was around 14k (and that was also what I got when I sold when the chart showed 16K). Annyoing, because I was not checking that properly until now, I thought the selling/buying price will be slightly different than the one shown in the chart, but not by 2K! 
Is there a way in coinbase to put a price limit for buying and selling? I know you can do that on gdax, but I have yet to get verified there (I need to renew my national ID next week to do so)
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:23:15
can't wait to switch to gdax next week!

Thinking of buying this for one of my friends (hint,hint)��
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:24:53
The problem is that once it has made it on the blockchain, it is immutable, so you can't just delete it. ALso, if they use hundreds of blocks to store one file, how will you be able to detect it, as these blocks are not added together, and nor they have to be sequential....
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:48:47
Ahhhh, so annoying that I have no fiat available for the next one month to take advantage of this dip������ (tempting to buy using a credit card, but I won't play with the money I don't have yet)
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:08:33
different cases. With internet, you are not forced to store the data. With blockchain, if you are a miner or have a full node, you are forced to store the whole blockchain. So maybe not BTC holders, but minners and those who run full nodes will be considered as committing a crime..
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:55:19
you are allowed to have some extra stuff (apart from senders/receivers addresses, amount to be transferred, etc...). I think at the beginning it was for novelty (e.g. write your name on the blockchain forever). Say you have an illegal image, which is just a byte stream when you store it on a computer. You split it into x parts, and put these into x different transactions. Then you can assemble them later, and recreate the illegal image. At least, that is how I understand it
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:02:19
As far as  I know, even with a hard fork, you are forced to keep the old blocks. Unless you have to go back to 2014 where the first illegal blocks were spotted, and do a "retroactive hard fork". That is, you have to somehow re-mine all the valid blocks between then and now, which in my opinion is rather infeasible. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:11:19
That is actually a very good analogy! Say you use this mechanism to start distributing child P or any other illegal stuff (you send to your consumers the decoder software that takes your twitter feed and recreates the illegal files).  Is Twitter then committing a crime by hosting your tweets?
Even if that was the case, Twitter can easily delete your files and go on "living" while we can't do the same (i.e. delete the bad data) without destroying the blockchain.

Use gdax, which is the same exchange but with more features like buy and sell limits etc. Also much lower transaction fees. But you have to register to coinbase first and then register to gdax using your coinbase account (extra verification required, but with it). Using coinbase for a couple of months, I spent so much on transaction fees. Check out this guide:

Actually, it was not lambo that drove me into it...early retirement dreams... now set back by about 6 months to a year if I lose it all... But actually one positive outcome is I have become very aware of my spendings. For example, I have realized that I was spending like 200 euros per month on massages (I am a runner, so I get injured quite a lot) ---&gt; now replace that with Yoga, at home!.. I almost ate out every night, nothing fancy, mostly take outs, but easily 10-15 euros per day, I can reduce that to at most 5 euros if I eat at home...just these two changes will bring around 500 euros per month, about 1BTC (at the current price) per year.. And don't even get me started about impulse spending on clothes and shoes, etc...... So the silver lining, no matter how this turns out, I know now how to save at least 10K euros more per year, without being too frugal.
@_date: 2018-03-30 06:00:33
Hmmm. Doesn't coinbase still allow that? ( I switched to gdax since January, so haven't used it since then). I still have a debit card and some cash on it but I was hit by unexpected 10k euro tax that I have to pay by May. So might even have to sell some stocks by mid April to make that sum. I just hope at least the stock market recovers a bit by then, otherwise this is gonna be the worst first half of the year for me from financial point of view ��

I firmly believe in blockchain, that is why I even booked a flight all the way to South Africa for the blockchain africa summit in March. However, not sure if bitcoin is going to be the MySpace or Facebook of the crypto currencies. ..

Mid Oct: It is my birthday, let me try this bitcoin thing.
Early Nov: shit, I have lost like 500 euros, out of a 2K investement, shall I go out? No, it will definitely go up, put some more
Mid Nov: Mmm, I have gained like 3K euros out of a 5K investement, that is almost double! Yeeha, put some more!
Mid Dec: Wow, I have gained liked 26k out of around 10K investement! 50K, 50K, 50K! Next year I am gonna get a lasik surgery,  probably a hair transplant in Turkey to take care of my balding head, and I will still have some good 5-10K left. I love life!
Mid Jan: WTF? I am now only 5K+, should I go out before it it's too late?
Now: I am at -9K, out of a total of 28K investement. That is around 33% loss. Shall I take my 19K out and accept my defeat and leave or wait a bit, risking to lose it all?
I know I am not gonna take your advice, because I asked when I was still 5K+ and didn't do anything, actually even tried a little bit of day trading that dragged me down further. So just talking to myself, like any normal crazy person....
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:27:00
Yeah, would be nice to hear your view on that. I ve invested around 35k and now worth around 20k if I cash out. Shall I accept a loss of 15k or shall I wait and risk a loss of  25k or even more if the ship keeps sinking ��
@_date: 2018-02-21 06:52:00
This is actually more healthy, two steps forward and one step back. A thousand up a day is not sustainable, remember December. A 1% increase per day will take us to over 450k in a year, which I don't think it is gonna happen. So just enjoy the discount on such days as today, if you have the Fiat to play with. I just wired 1.5k, hoping it dips even more today and tomorrow ��

Shiiiit, sorry to spread FUD, but this doesn't look good :-(
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:32:26
In Gdax, if you want to avoid the fees, just set a buy limit some cents less than the market value. Then you are not charged any fee at all if the price falls down to that level, ...play few times, up it up a few dollars if it keeps increasing, still following it only with 50cents or so below the market price, then sooner or later you will catch it.

One part of the story of "banking the unbanked" that I don't understand is how the people in the developing nations could make use of the crypto currency if there is no point of entry or exit from/to fiat. Take remittance,  for example. I send btc to a relative living in an African county who doesn't have a bank account. He gets it without the ridiculous transaction fees that are agencies like western union require. But then what? no shops that accept cypto, no atm machines to begin with, government controls all fiat leaving or exitinga the country, etc.. if there is someone who has a connection tof a country that allows fiat to crypto exchange somehow, then he could be the link to them (basically he will become their exchange, taking crypto from them, paying them in fiat and cashing it out, if/when he wants to,  in another country). But typical African government wouldn't allow this to be done openly, so this has to be done undercover, illegally.    Or am I missing something?  I mean, the poor people in developing countries don't want crypto to speculate on its future growth but to use it as  a currency, but I fail to see how it could work without a blessing from the government somehow
