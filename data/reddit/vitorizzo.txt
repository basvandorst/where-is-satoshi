Yeah this id just yolo it all at once throw it on a nano and hodl if I had the money
@_date: 2019-07-13 13:48:11
That’s a nice thought
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:18:54
Send them to gdax first. The send it to where you want to send it 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:42:10
Cuts down on fees
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:12:16
I find it to be easier to verify on coinbase. That will make you verified on gdax
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:55:18
How do they determine how many you get?
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:35:49
Are you in the US? I’ve helped like 4 or 5 people this month sign up for coinbase and verify themselves there and that made them verified on gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:35:58
You did it right. Just have to wait. Next time try eth and see if it’s faster
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:01:40
I wanted to sell at at least 3000 now it’s gonna go down to probably nothing before I’m able to sell. Fucking bullshit
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:34:22
How much did you send? It took 3 hours to send like 470usd worth of btc to binance a few days ago. Before that it only took 30 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:10:08
I can’t get it out of coinbase.
Edit: maybe I can 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:54:27
Made it to a little under 15,000 on coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:07:07
I’m hoping man 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:39:04
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:45:51
My weak hand took the profits and ran. Will I regret it one day? Maybe. Will I get back in at another dip? Maybe. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:54:33
People trade between cyprtos all day I don’t see how this is any different 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:30:42
Good luck getting verified though. It’s been legit 3 days not verified yet
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:49:54
I’m pissed I can’t fucking sell it 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:31:34
It’s showing up as 0.00 like everyone sold it lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:34:59

What I already have I mean. I can’t sell it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:42:30
Can confirm.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:37
Can’t do anything with the bcash in coinbase right now 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:17:03
BCC is bitcoin cash on binance right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:04:02
I feel like by the time I can have a chance to sell bcash it’s either gonna up or down 1500.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:35:18
That would be a Christmas miracle
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:20:39
Every night? 
@_date: 2018-08-30 07:05:55
So I should just sell all my alt coins and put it all into bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-13 14:15:11

There's hodling and then there's common sense. Get your profits and come back later.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:01:35
By the time they wake up bitcoin is going to be back to 1200
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:18:43
985 a coin was the lowest I saw it go 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:13:06
When's he next time they can get approved?

Coinbase is good because it’s very user friendly. I use it but I’m not a fan of all the fees though
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:11:30

@_date: 2019-04-18 23:45:58
Is there a calculator that shows how much 100 bucks of bitcoin brought today will be if bitcoin reaches 100,000 or 1,000,000
Edit: I’m dumb.
@_date: 2019-04-28 18:39:49
You would actually sell if Bitcoin hit 1 Billion? If it hits a Trillion I’ll think about it but a billion lol no
@_date: 2019-04-05 09:12:37
Ehhh 
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:18:04
70k using a web wallet? Why? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:17:56
Moral of the story is to just hold. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:40:38
With the fees it would probably be better to do a monthly thing or every two weeks

I had 2.5 bitcoins I bought in Feb when bitcoin was like 950. After the ETF fail I sold even though I really didn't need the money for anything. Now I have one bitcoin when I bought back in at like 2500. I could have had well over 10,000 right now if I just kept the 2.5 coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:03:26
I’m kicking myself everyday for selling my only 3 coins at 1100 each after that ETF fail. I can’t imagine being that guy. I don’t know what I’d do.
@_date: 2019-09-09 01:24:49
I can’t believe he only gave them $9.43

I remember that story. I’d be there all day and night just digging. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:25:38
Same brought .90 at 2450 this morning. It's been going up non stop for the past like 2 months. The day I decide to get back in it goes down after I buy some. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 08:33:40
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:23:49
Bought at like 990 sold at like 1250. I wonder when we will see another dip like the ETF approval mess

When's the next failed ETF so it can go back down to 800 again.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:24:25
Can it go back to 3000 first?
