Yeah, just like the how they treat the Constitution as a social experiment in freedom... oh wait.

Yes, however people that don't believe anything, and are willing to entertain your opinion are left with nothing to go off of, and will potentially be less likely to entertain it in the future if similar opinions are expressed again without anything behind it.

You should probably proved sources for your claims, as you are totally going to be buried and immediately written off as a nonsensical conspiracy theorist. 
Even if you had sources outright... the same thing would probably happen.

Not many would be willing to take time to verify that, [Ukrainian jet fighters that downed the plane]( and that [Turkey orchestrated events involving chemical weapons in Syria]( and that those events are failed attempts at generating pretext for wars.
You really do need to lay everything out for people, complete with internets, if you want be [*winning*]( at teh propaganda wars. eg, I have an opinion, here's a thing to help explain how I arrived at this opinion.
Usually how this works is that the person making the claims has to provide *something* to backup what is being claimed, even if that something is in itself highly questionable[.](

well start your vms and copy your blockchains to usbs, grab your switches and routers, get more public facing ips, connect your alt coin mining rigs and game servers and host some 15.0.1 nodes. It is only 150gb right now and don't forgot to port forward 8333.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:14:10
that's why you have multiple routers connected to a switch connected to a routerless modem, then a node behind each router that should get is own public ip.

This is why you buy in slowly over time. 
Instead of trying to time the market with one big buy in, you can for example buy a tenth of a bitcoin a week for 20 weeks or something.
That way if it drops further you still have cash and can reevaluate or buy tenths at even lower prices and average out the total cost in dollars.

At least give some sort of reason why. I don't think bitcoin is 'nuts' as a concept by itself, but markrobinson85 is being dangerously hopeful and idealistic which I am assuming makes you somehow think bitcoin is 'nuts' by association.
Personally, I think completely ignoring the whole "military industrial complex" thing as a factor is necessary to fathom a thing such as what markrobinson85 is imagining, otherwise there is going to be some kind of major ordeal in between.
Perhaps he left out some massive change in hearts and minds leaving no one left willing to pull the triggers or possibly some devastating and gruesome conflict between factions of diverging military industrial interests that lasted for decades during the transition between a [permanant war]( type of system to the aforementioned "hippy bitopia". Perhaps markrobinson85 didn't want to add that factor to keep things especially brave and optimistic in hopes that somehow those industrial interests would just daintily step aside and let all of this occur with nary a missile launched or drone deployed in opposition.
