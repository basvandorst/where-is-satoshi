I'm guessing either ETH, or ETC won't exist in 5 years. If anyone sees this post in 2021, PM me.

In terms of Delta-V. A little fuel can go a long way with an efficient engine and/or little to push. 90% of the fuel can already be dumped and you'll probably have 50% d-V left.

Low-Earth Orbit is halfway to anywhere. Simply speaking of course, I still believe this mission will fail.
@_date: 2014-02-11 01:54:13
Sorry guys, you lost.

You know what, I'll edit it.

I am well aware of the difficulties in getting to... well really anywhere in space. Which is why it's really easy to see that this project will fail, no doubt. Unfortunately.

And people still think this is healthy for a currency? We are in a bubble.
@_date: 2015-07-16 20:23:26
Nee, ik denk dat ING al te graag je geld wilt ontvangen.

100 days to make 50 BTC sounds amazing right now.

How do I short BTC?
@_date: 2016-07-10 15:25:00
Yea, I don't really know what they're using.

I know why you can't grab it, you need to be friends. Invite me if you want.

I am insanely jealous. :(
Somebody just left 1 full BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:38:35
That would work. Or send an envelope with nothing in it and tell them to message you later for "free" BTC.
You need tracking though.

I fear of us blowing ourselves up too. But I have faith.

Ouch. I am glad I only lost .1 BTC total... still a HUGE loss for me, as someone who barely has enough money to eat every night.

You're pretty stupid if you scam people and you leave that info on your whois. Within 2 seconds I found the guy on facebook. He even left his city and area on the whois... great job
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:46:25
Yes, and I wish somebody had warned me so I hadn't lost my 0.1 BTC. I am making this post to warn new members in the community.

Practically the same. House always wins.

Of course you can land on Europa. It's just really hard.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:35:15
I will just go to Europa, or Titan...

I am commenting so I can order the book later. Hopefully I can find a site with BTC.

Good ideas earn you money... meanwhile I am broke.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:03:29
My bank transfers money anywhere in Europe instantly, without fees. And if you need to transfer money to America I'm pretty sure it's not more than 10c or so fees (Even less than BTC). So yea...
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:50:15
Nah. Verify just makes it comment. Its just silent now.

I improved it a bit :)
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:45:29
I don't want to crush all your dreams, but this guy isn't giving any coins at all. Most likely he has 0 balance and because he isn't typing verify the bot doesn't say that transaction failed. Pretty genius. I'll show it right now.

Freedom is very nice, yes, but you can have a home and just leave it and come back later too. Anyhow, just live your life however you want man, rock on.

Hey they wont have a home, land or freedom but at least they have BTC!
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:01:45
It's him!!! Great job, man. You made quite a lot of money of that. I wish I had done this and made some money. :P
Enjoy it.

"Indestructible" isn't really possible. Could one drop a nuclear bomb on this wallet and not destroy it?

That's insane. I wish I had thought of this... I just keep losing my BTC.

You're going to regret that when 1 BTC is 1.000.000 dollars. :P

How are you homeless voluntarily? What reason do you have to choose to be homeless? Just wondering.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:13:48
I know homes are expensive but "voluntarily" makes it sound like he can afford one, but he just chooses not to.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:10:43
I have a hard time believiny
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:08:06
My bank (ING) sends money anywhere in Europe, nearly instantly and there are no fees. I was shocked to find this isn't standard...
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:39:55
Sure is, he is a fucking douche, but apparently he has quite a lot of BTC...
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:01:10
I am way too late, am I not?
Don't think anyone will ever read this, but I'll try.

Except most stores accepting BTC immediately convert them to USD...
