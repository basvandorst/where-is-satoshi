I suppose, but some people also take issue with the term "cryptocurrency" when applied to Bitcoin.

Most people say that Bitcoin allows for more anonymity than traditional cash currency.  But even if it's not more anonymous, the question remains, what is the advantage of this anonymity?

Correct, Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous.  Other altcoins are in fact truly anonymous.  I understand the value of digital, but are you saying that cryptocurrency anonymity is not advantageous?

Right, I understand that no one can computationally force anyone else to use a new fork/altcoin.  But that fact doesn't stop powerful people from devaluing the original altcoin/currency.  
For example, couldn't a nation or group of nations could use their financial, legal, and military resources to encourage/coerce people into adopting the currency of their choice?
Or let's say that Bitcoin becomes more valuable than the dollar, what prevents the wealth in Bitcoins from becoming concentrated in the hands of the few?  Perhaps it would be a different few than before, but I don't understand how the current decentralized Bitcoin rules prevent it.  For example, if currently wealthy individuals transfer their assets from dollars into Bitcoin, can't they still use their Bitcoin wealth to control jobs, politics, and the means of production?

Altcoin rules can be changed without 100% consensus.  The creation of a fork (i.e. a new altcoin) doesn't require approval from anyone.  After than, the value of the new fork/altcoin is determined by market forces.  I don't think it's certain that less democratic forks/altcoins will fail.
All currencies and altcoins must compete with each other, but can't powerful individuals ensure unfair competition?  What makes altcoins less susceptible than traditional currency to concentration of wealth into the hands of the few?  And once wealth is concentrated, as it is now, can't the wealthy few ensure that a less democratic currency becomes the most valuable?
