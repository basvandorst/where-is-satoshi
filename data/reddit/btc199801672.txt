Read the instructions on MtGox. They give you their bank info(swift code, acc  etc). Now to do the actual transfer, that varies from bank to bank. I had to go to an actual branch and get it done. Some might allow you to do it online. Research.

'exceed $20,000 in gross payment volume for goods and services'
Also, I am Canadian. So it doesn't apply to me.

In simple terms: Someone has a lot of bitcoins (maybe they mined them back in 2010) and they want to cash out. So they sell a lot of coins (and possibly at a slight lower price than the current), and now most of the buyers get what they need. All of a sudden, there's a lack of buyers. On top of them, sellers are like WTF, there's no one buying. Also, the little amount of buyers that are left are like 'Hey, that person just sold theirs for less than the current value', i am going to lower my bid. So not only are there less amount of buyers now, but they are also bid lower than normal amount. The sellers all panic and start asking for lower price because not only is the price gone down but theres not a lot of buyers, and it's like a domino effect, and it drives the price lower and lower.

How do they report my activity to IRS? They don't have my SIN # or even my most recent address...

I wouldn't. But my guess is as good as anyone's. I don't even own any bitcoins haha.
