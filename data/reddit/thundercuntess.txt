Fucking Nostradamus, amazing he's come back in so many life forms
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:21:54
Can anyone explain the factors behind a possible crash? Real factors not some imaginary bullshit everyone seems to spew trying to relate this to other market crashes
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:21:33
How are you handling the taxes? Did your accountant advise you at all?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:46:13
I stand corrected. Thank you!
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:31:26
Sure. Moron.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:27:39
It's called a Satoshi. I million satoshi = 1 bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:22:30
You dont get charge caprital gains for mining. That is gross revenue then minus out expenses. Get an LLC and deduct all expenses
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:21:24
Charge your rig $1000 /mo to mine at your house. Plus pizza expenses to monitor. And Mountain Dew. And twizzlers
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:12:21
Fucking beautiful
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:52:05

The "bond" answer. Keep digging my friend
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:00:12
How about we accept Moores Law to Bitcoin and relax?
@_date: 2018-10-25 21:35:32
Who's this imaginary entity the government 'owes'?
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:35:19

@_date: 2019-10-15 17:30:31
If it takes off I’m setting a sell limit at 20% below the current price
@_date: 2019-02-10 03:40:36
It's like looking at your mother and thinking she could of murdered you when you were in her womb
@_date: 2019-02-27 22:28:13
That's not the alternate,  that's our universe
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:01:40
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:17:56
Since it seems everyone hates coinbase, can you offer a better alternative? I'm not pro-coinbase at all, I'm simply trying to find a better exchange. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:26:57
Elon Musk is Satoshi
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:16:35
You're fucking clueless
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:37:12
Thanks Elon!!!
@_date: 2019-12-03 12:11:24
So you’re saying there’s a chance
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:21:15
Always. I only see stupid people
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:34:11
He's worth 20 billion. You're an asshat
@_date: 2019-12-12 01:02:56
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:50:48
You can't. But clearly all the pussies downvoting me know more than me. Fucking cunts
@_date: 2019-12-23 17:52:31
That’s the only way you make money short term
@_date: 2019-12-23 17:40:22
Every article is a pump or dump. Just ignore it.
@_date: 2018-11-09 19:32:19
great joke
@_date: 2019-01-09 00:52:42
@_date: 2019-01-15 14:27:27
It doesnt work that way. At all. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 12:54:52
Because I hate the federal reserve
@_date: 2017-10-02 22:06:13
Another bullshit piece of crap from Coinbase. Amazing fuckers over there
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:19:58
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:49:02
Your math sucks
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:02:12
12,000 BTC would be nice
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:45:52
We're having a trade war with everyone, not just China; but I do agree most of the money (and panic) will come out of China
@_date: 2019-09-24 03:16:03
Maybe he meant “minor bitcoin” or maybe “bitcoin miner”? We’ll never know
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:51:19
Long live Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:57:31
I came here to be happy and I had to learn about "brown cylinders".  FML
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:30:37
Thank you. This is ridiculous comparing or inventing market caps
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:45:30
You did right. It's better to have property outright. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:41:31
Can someone explain this scenario:
 If I/we hold our Bitcoin, whats the worse that can happen?
@_date: 2017-07-29 12:58:07
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:03:49
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:41:06
If BCH had fees no one would be able to use it. 
You need a job to pay fees
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:59:46
No, i wouldn't.
Instead of making payments to the loan, use those same payments to buy bitcoin. 
Any difference would end up insignificant in 5 years, 10 years. 
Dont go in debt to invest!
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:21:12
What's your point?
@_date: 2017-06-28 12:05:30
I'm buying more now. Selling every piece of shit thing I have and getting more coins!!!
