I think it's because these ALT holder got in so late. They fail to see how bitcoin has performed as a steady store of wealth, and instead they get scooped up in these temporary PnD coins

Good point. Tho some say it's "fair" because he did clearly announce bitcoin to everyone that was interested. Just no one understood at that time how important this way.
I've heard early investors suggest this also. But then again, these early investors are also holding their coins (and they probably also got them by mining super easily on their laptop)...

No doubt, but IMO being a crypto reserve currency is all about being fungible. 
Eg: You could say diamonds are more efficient than gold (they carry more value per kg). However people use diamonds far less than gold - simply because diamonds are less fungible (you need a high-class expert to buy/sell diamonds).

Nicely put! Yeah a lot of ethereum's governance is highly centralized. Which gives for so much uncertainty. Bitcoin is trusted and used as a store of value (and occasionally to take others' value) because we all know there'll never be any "rewinds" after a big hack.

Good point. IMO this is one of the most important factors influencing bitcoin's stability as a reserve currency. 
Compare BTC to pre-mined crypto coins. Most of clever pre-mined coin creators will slowly exchange their hoard into bitcoin - thus diminishing the value of their coin vs bitcoin. It's a never ending loop really! 
Absolutely everyone wants to get their hands and hold BTC. Even bank thieves don't care about paper currency anymore... they want BTC and they (wrongly) get it via cryptolockers.
