It's only manipulation when it's going down.
@_date: 2018-09-11 06:49:54
It sounds like what you want isn't crypto at all, but more stocks / regular securities.
@_date: 2017-02-26 07:10:37
At the time it was around $25, that's all that matters.
@_date: 2017-02-26 08:06:21
It's just a circlejerk on this sub, a lot of the users start screeching when someone mentions selling Bitcoin.
To be honest, given all the hassle of opening + verifying the required accounts and going through this whole process, you're better off just withdrawing to PayPal.
@_date: 2017-02-19 22:26:20
This is vandalism.

A lot of these used Bitcoin gateways briefly and dropped it soon after. You'll find a lot of the previous ones are no longer current.
@_date: 2017-03-05 05:45:08
These companies aren't Bitcoin speculators, so why would they hold it? Of course they're going to use a gateway to convert it to cash.
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:06:41
This isn't manipulation, it's just a good old-fashioned selloff.
@_date: 2017-03-03 05:15:17
Tulip bulbs did exactly that.
@_date: 2017-03-12 23:52:36
Nobody knows, most people here are just delusional.
@_date: 2017-03-05 05:38:54
All the money you put into it should be money you can afford to lose. In the sense that in the event that Bitcoin shits the bed, your reaction will be "damn, that's too bad" rather than "fuck, guess it's instant Ramen for the next 2 years"
@_date: 2017-03-03 05:44:20
What kinda drugs can you buy with $5?
@_date: 2017-03-04 05:03:39
Dude you can't just throw around insider information like that.
@_date: 2017-03-03 04:42:31
So is longing it. I'd be looking to get on the short side.

What you're not getting is that business owners, for the most part, just want to take care of their business. They don't care for speculating on exchange rates and holding foreign currencies/assets they don't need for their business, because it's not what they're good at.
When I sell and ship items overseas, I have payment gateways that immediately convert payments in foreign currencies into my local currency so I can use it just like in the example. There's no reason to keep separate accounts for payments I get in Euros, Pounds, bottle caps and Bitcoins just in case the value of them goes up. I convert everything foreign into local currency so I can keep using it and keep doing business.
Holding something like Bitcoin is just an added layer of risk the majority of businesses just don't want to deal with, so they only accept it because their exchange partner will convert it to cash. They can't afford for part of their revenue to fluctuate unpredictably if they can simply avoid it by converting it right away.
@_date: 2017-03-04 03:11:13
Because Bitcoin is volatile as fish tits, nobody can narrow that down. If someone says they know what's going to happen, they're lying or delusional.
@_date: 2017-03-05 05:02:19
Most exchanges would be fine with this once your ID etc checks out. Unless you're talking about $75k worth in cash, which any seller would find extremely sketchy. There aren't many law-abiding individuals who come across $75k in cash which they can't deposit to a bank and want to exchange it anonymously into Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-03-05 05:35:58
Exactly. This is speculation, not an investment.

Captain hindsight over here!
Why didn't **you** buy in 2008 and know to hold all the way till now?
Why didn't you buy Apple stock in 2005?
Why didn't you buy AMD stock last year?
Why didn't you bet on Trump winning, or the Brexit vote?
@_date: 2017-03-05 05:03:51
Using a debit card at a regulated exchange will always require an ID supplement to check if it's actually your card, not a stolen one.
@_date: 2016-12-29 06:16:19
It's almost like finance majors can see why it isn't viable.
@_date: 2016-12-29 03:52:38
If you don't have even $100k, you're in no shape to open a 'bank'.
@_date: 2016-11-24 12:54:30
Yes, and yes.

As long as you're not expecting to ever break even, you'll do fine.
@_date: 2017-09-27 08:17:11
Wouldn't be a very big bag.
@_date: 2017-10-03 09:31:14
I knew there was some crossover with and but this is another level.
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:44:37
Betting on a horse.
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:49:43
Was that ever proven to be real or fake. I **really** want it to be fake.
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:01:06
Can't blame them, that's what 90% of the people here treat it as. "I've cashed in, spread the word of Bitcoin so the price goes up!"
Honestly the similarity to a Ponzi scheme and the tulip mania is uncanny.
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:21:32
Maybe if you lived in an island principality or something with its own laws, but if you live in the US you need to follow it's laws. That's how it all works.

That's exactly what it is. Tulip bulbs 2.0.
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:17:22
In realized gains? That's all that matters in the end.
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:30:04
Exactly, just be glad you didn't back then. It could've shit the bed and you'd have nothing.
@_date: 2017-05-26 05:58:16
I do.
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:00:41
That's all Bitcoin is. Tulip bulbs 2.0.
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:07:04
It's a good thing that you didn't. Never speculate with money you can't afford to lose. Sure, it could hit $10K, it could also hit zero. Most of this sub is extremely delusional about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:12:25
Don't speculate with money you can't afford to lose. This thing could hit $2k, it could hit $0, it could end up never hitting either. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 06:27:43
This is good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:08:05
@_date: 2017-06-10 00:33:53
I sure as hell hope it is, lmao
@_date: 2017-06-10 00:28:16
You're only realising this now?
