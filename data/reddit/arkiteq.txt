I'm sure your right.  I've just been going down a list of possibilities.  The amount of information I had given GOX has been worrying me since I stopped using them last year.  Im still troubled who has that database, but it does not appear to be related to my issue.

Well, that's incredibly useful, ssa.gov wasn't mentioned by any of the agencies I've called so far.  Thanks!

On the part about someone employed using my SSN.  From what I gathered when talking with the IRS I don't think that's the case.  Return theft through efile has become rampant in recent years, this is likely what occurred.

The fact that it's even possible to look that up with Bitcoin, is fucking awesome.

I belong to BMT and wanted to teach the folks there about Bitcoin and how it can be traded.  Some of you may be interested.

Holy shit.  I actually need these.

Yes, their compliance and security write-up in their faq is impressive.  Hoping they gain more visibility by participating in this AMA.

"I did nothing to the btc exchanges, I ddos'ed after the price had already crashed to test my power without risking my investments"

I for one am a Mars-One hopeful candidate, and reject this earthly qualification.

CampBX, any way for users to get the retroactive 10% reduction?  In the infancy of your exchange and Bitcoin it was not obvious this existed.  I would prefer not to create a new acct.

Because I have no idea what im doing but stopped lurking to try and help bring more diversification to the exchanges.

First time ever, I am proud of your country.

Somebody had better go, I don't want to see a picture of this poor lady eating dinner alone on the next Forbe's article.

Campbx, Are you in talks with Ripple to become a Ripple gateway?
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:09:55
I requested via twitter:

Or horde them.  I welcome our new Bitcoin overlords.
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:06:29
I'm sure Campbx will help us out.
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:03:42
Campbx, what deposit methods do you currently support and what methods will you be supporting in the future?  One of Bitfloors strengths was the cash deposits.

gauth allows you to print out one use codes in the event you lose your phone etc.
