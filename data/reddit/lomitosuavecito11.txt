Inverse ETFs that benefit from the downfall of their underlying assets. 


The 2008 crisis isn’t as simple as that, both government and private sector were involved and damaged the lives of thousands of individuals around the world, but let’s avoid that topic and suppose that the hypothetical case that you provide happens: in that scenario it would be highly possible that people forget and continue using the current system, after all, humans are reluctant to change. 
Bloomberg published a [study]( (sorry, Spanish is my main language and I can’t find an English version of the article) that concludes that a majority of people in developed countries prefer to continue using cash than switching to an electronic version of it. That, of course, would include Bitcoin. 
But who knows, maybe humans will change their perspectives and move to Bitcoin, but meanwhile I think that we’re far from entering a new era of money and commerce, at least for now.

Interest rates
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:18:38
Interest rates can’t stay low forever and Central Banks will adjust them according to each scenario. I never stated that they would go up tomorrow or the next week, but it is a possibility that needs to be contemplated before making bold declarations about the future of a memecoin.

It’s your money, pal, not mine, and I really hope that your investments perform well. But I would respectfully recommend you to really get into finance before you invest in anything, specially if it’s a high-risk asset like Bitcoin. 


Not really, the money deposited at banks generates nominal returns (before inflation and taxes) and it’s used by these corporations to create loans, invest in different instruments and generate revenue for their company (after all, its a business and it needs to stay profitable). So it’s not wise to declare that “money just does nothing” because it does. 
Don’t take it personal, ignore my advise if you wish, but finances are not made by wishful thinking and they rarely share and idealistic perspective of life. You won’t convince people and institutional investors to user their money to buy Bitcoin just because you believe that it will change the world as we know it.

Not really, in that case Bitcoin would plummet too due to the people’s need to increase their liquidity when rates go up and money gets more expensive. 
The problem with Bitcoin Maximalists is their lack of understanding of economics and finances; this e-coin won’t benefit from a recession, but there’s other financial devices to increase your own wealth during hard times.

Tight regulations, inability to process the same amount of transactions per second as the system it’s trying to surpass (e.g. Visa and MasterCard), lack of adoption as a way to exchange goods and services, market manipulation, bubbles created by people that don’t understand the asset they’re buying, etcetera.

Each to his own, after all you could be right and I could be wrong, or viceversa. Fiat system is going to collapse? I highly doubt it, money is more complicated than the “cash printing” explanation that many people reduce it to.

Wrong. Each Bitcoin is composed of 100,000,000 satoshis.

Use Bitmex

Aaaaand you should’ve sold at the top to buy at the bottom

To be honest I don’t like long-term trades, but if I had to pick then I would choose Bitcoin, Ripple and Stellar Lumens for the long run (don’t take it as a financial advise tho). Wait a couple of days, the markets are highly volatile now and all the indicators can tell us that most of the coins are overbought.

The technology is good, sure, but technology alone won’t make the price go up. Finances aren’t ideological like crypto fanboys, they’re logical most of the time, so if you’re going to speculate with cryptocurrencies (they aren’t an investment) then administer your portfolio, learn TA and sell when you reach your goals.
@_date: 2019-04-11 10:54:24
Cryptoshills are stupid man, they must learn to go with the market, not against it due to their idealism
@_date: 2019-04-05 03:28:14
Learn TA, it’s not magic but it’s based on probability which can help you improve your finances. Read Bollinger on Bollinger Bands by John Bollinger

We can say that when we reach 20K again, let’s not go so far, when we reach 10K
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:37:12
A lot more money was lost by a lot more people who bought at 20K and used the”hodl” strategy 
@_date: 2019-04-05 03:51:18
Investing an amount each month or week reduces the risks, but you would make more money (or Bitcoins) if you traded it. Just follow an investment plan and stick to it

“One thing is certain: the current financial system is on the verge of total collapse.”
Based on what? It’s so fragile and about to collapse that cryptoshills get energetic every time it goes up against the dollar? 
Also, it won’t happen because the world isn’t digitalized yet, there’s a lot of places where cash is the main exchange means instead of credit or debit cards, how could BTC help people that can’t even use the banking system? (And not because they don’t want to, but their communities aren’t advanced enough to support this kind of transactions)
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:36:12
It’s not my fault that you don’t know how to manage your portfolio and it’s risks, you’re just a crypto fanboy that buys compulsively, right? 
@_date: 2019-04-03 23:28:05
Lmao, who would hold at tops instead of selling? That’s why you guys are losing so much money, and I don’t want to make fun of you, but markets have a structure, bull runs don’t last forever, you must buy to get a profit and learn to administer your portfolio, if you don’t you’ll keep getting rekt by whales.
@_date: 2019-04-11 11:05:14
Except it won’t happen

The bear market ain’t over yet

I remember when I was a Crypto Fanboy just like you, thinking it would replace Fiat currencies. That ain’t gonna happen, instead, they’ll interact with each other in the future.
The USD won’t go away for a long time, it’s the currency that everyone uses for commerce. In fact, if it to looses all of its value, why would you care for the price of Bitcoin? I mean, what does it matter if BTC reaches 1 million dollars if the currency that people use to value it becomes obsolete? 
@_date: 2018-07-29 17:01:54
No, don’t be stupid. Markets are cycles, it can’t be up or down forever. Back in December we had a bull market, many people (due to FOMO) bought at 20K with hopes of it reaching 30, 40 or 50 thousand dollars. Unfortunately, as you know, that didn’t happen and we’re back at 8K dollars, ironically, people are selling instead of buying. 
Hodling (besides being cringy) is a really stupid strategy. No one doubts that it’s the future of money (and many other processes) but if you don’t make money out of it, what’s the point?
