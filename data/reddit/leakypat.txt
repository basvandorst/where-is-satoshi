blockchain.info are not the model to compare to! They suffer from the exact same problem. They do however have a chrome app, but don't push their users to it. They prefer instead to sign as many users up as possible using the web delivered version.

Totally agree with this. This will take time to happen and I for one am looking forward to the next several years contributing to building this niche tech and solving some of these problems. I really believe in 5-10 years time we will start to hit that network effect and can see huge adoption world wide.

@_date: 2014-10-30 15:23:46
So trust Coinbase and use one of their regular off chain accounts 
@_date: 2014-10-30 06:50:54
can't disagree with anything you say there, they are great at on-boarding users and raising money!
@_date: 2014-10-30 12:41:14
No web browser ever checks the integrity of the code being served, the chrome app delivery system does 
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:01:40
The point is keeping your money in a service you think is "trusted" vs "untrusted" if every time you use the service it can deliver you different software without any verification process you really shouldn't use it.
@_date: 2014-10-30 10:45:07
That is my point, but i am also saying they are doing the hard stuff (crypto/ multisig) before the easy stuff (controlled to a reasonable degree software environments )

Blockchain.info is way out of date now especially in terms of security (probably the worst)  and also privacy , I would avoid...

@_date: 2014-10-30 05:07:22
correct, actually, not using them ever, not even once...hence, not offering them in the first place is the answer
@_date: 2014-10-30 05:02:49
indeed, broken down in your article from the summer:
@_date: 2014-10-25 05:18:55
 For example, what risks does the COD courier take on?
They carry cash around with them and then have to process it on behalf of the merchant
I guess the market would work out the exact terms and conditions between the merchant/courier , buyer/courier, but yes, the merchant has to deliver and the buyer has a stake so cannot act unreasonable or waste time, tying up the merchants stock and wasting courier's time by not being at home etc.
@_date: 2014-11-01 22:00:25
normally these tools are just for recovery in the event the service disappears and require your offline and online key , so using this tool as your wallet defeats the purpose of the vault in the first place
@_date: 2014-10-30 06:04:32
exactly my thoughts, it is for the good of the community and the future. When Bitcoin becomes massively adopted, we cannot have an industry standard that delivers unsigned software over the web to run in insecure browser environments.
@_date: 2014-10-25 11:56:09
I'm more concerned about other parties being able to file, i assume because it is public they can't claim the invention?
@_date: 2014-11-05 11:55:39
if you read the pastebin linked from the top post, you can have a 2 of 3 multisig with the merchant, buyer and courier (doubling as an escrow agent) . The buyers gets to inspect the goods when the courier delivers and they can then both sign the funds over to the merchant...full details in the paste bin
@_date: 2014-11-04 06:32:41
But he delivers unsigned software into your browser when you visit the web version of their wallet...did you check what the code did with your private key the last time you visited the site?
They even provide a chrome app so why have a web version? 
"Trustless" is good marketing...
@_date: 2014-10-26 08:35:54
yes! this would be awesome, leakypat is already working on a different start-up so has no time.

Seriously, your mum or dad downloading Bitcoin qt then generating multisig addresses?
@_date: 2014-10-30 02:12:49
1. Is your code open source?
2. Can you, a hacker on your webserver, or authorities inject code from your server at anytime to send the keys back to the server?
This should only be implemented open source and via a signed delivery mechanism, not the web
@_date: 2014-10-31 06:56:04
So every time you send a transaction you sign it with your hot and cold key using the open source tool? What was the point in setting up the vault then?
@_date: 2014-10-31 11:58:53
That's a really offensive and stupid thing to say 
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:13:49
Although it is possible to chain unconfirmed transactions most wallets don't , what you are likely experiencing is a property of the Bitcoin protocol itself whereby it is not your balance that is important but the unspent outputs you have. 
If you have 10btc on one output and spend 0.0001 the 9.999 change will be unavailable to you until normally a single confirmation has happened. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 04:54:36
Yes, if they are marketing this as a cold storage alternative (vault sure sounds like it), they shouldn't. I think their main idea is that they have a service where their users control their keys and don't have to trust Coinbase. Unfortunately with web delivery, they still need to trust them everytime they use their site and forever afterwards.
@_date: 2014-10-25 12:02:14
Exactly, my original intention was to prevent these companies patenting this idea (and maybe buying the patent for a billion dollars) , it didn't get accepted due to some 1978 patent law (if i could afford the lawyers i'm sure they would know how to get it accepted) , so i have gone public in the hope that this will prevent them from doing so in the future.
Also any disruptive courier company could use this technique to offer something not currently available.
@_date: 2014-10-30 11:31:23
Ssl/tls compromise isn't involved in this attack
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:15:08
Having said that, breadwallet is 100x better and way more secure , I moved to it recently 
@_date: 2014-10-25 11:32:50
so was this whole exercise futile, or is it a gray area and i should hire a lawyer? :)
@_date: 2014-10-30 02:37:16
coinbase, the authorities or a hacker taking control of the server and sending edited javascript to your browser when you request the webpage, sending the key back to the server when you decrypt, and moving funds to  a different address, then (if they want) resetting the javascript back to what it was previously so no-one notices on subsequent web requests.  If there is a cosigner, they can do it to them too.
The web is a toy and this is crypto-theatre :)
@_date: 2014-10-30 05:55:40
yes, so do blockchain.info and some others, so why do they still have web delivery also?
the answer is: on-boarding users. Trading security for user acquisition
 
@_date: 2014-10-30 10:47:03
Where do they say that is their intention?
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:18:31
Contradict yourself much ?
@_date: 2014-10-25 10:33:34
cool, just looked at their site, will check it out. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 22:36:20
that's the point of the patent, they don't sign the transaction
@_date: 2014-10-25 22:10:34
this doesn't qualify as a patent, it was rejected, but anything in the public domain will be included in a patent search to determine the validity of future patent applications
so anyone who could afford to get it though the system would also have to contest this
@_date: 2014-10-30 09:43:35
Correct , my argument is that this is stationing armed guards outside the bank and leaving an open tunnel into the vault
@_date: 2014-11-27 10:09:58
Not if you are using ssl/tls
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:45:46
You are either a scammer, a troll or an idiot..
@_date: 2014-10-30 04:27:53
Of course they realise this, it is a calculated risk, same with blockchain.info (who actually have an chrome app as an alternative but don't push their users onto it) I am just raising awareness in the community as I beleive Bitcoin needs to lead the way in moving away from untrusted code delivered on the fly into a browser.
@_date: 2014-10-25 10:43:37
i bought 5k at around 630 and don't think i ever will sell
@_date: 2014-10-30 12:34:36
No, different code can be delivered every time you go to the site with your browser. Chrome/Firefox just loads the site if the certificate matches, if it doesn't it asks "is this ok?" And if you click "ok" it sends you the code anyway
@_date: 2014-10-25 11:21:05
What Are Abstract Ideas?
Abstract ideas are concepts like pure mathematics and algorithms. You cannot patent a formula. However, you can patent an application of that formula. Thus, while you cannot patent a mathematical formula that produces nonrepeating patterns, you can patent paper products that use that formula to prevent rolls of paper from sticking together. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 05:16:20
@_date: 2014-10-31 11:39:34
Your understanding is correct, but when you go to the coinbase site, they can send down javascript to steal your key when you decrypt it. Unless you verify the software program they send to you every time you use the site, you have no idea if they are  doing this or not.
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:16:36
Nope, it is an advanced wallet branched off their usual vault 
@_date: 2014-11-04 06:36:01
web wallets should not exist for many reasons, this is one of them, 2 factor authentication should always be mandatory and not SMS based
See my other ravings on the matter..
@_date: 2014-10-25 11:31:10
And i would imagine pi would be used to do this...
@_date: 2014-10-25 11:59:55
Just rereading it, zero confirmation would be OK as both parties trust the courier.
@_date: 2014-11-05 12:36:34
yes, that is correct
@_date: 2014-10-30 06:25:42
its a balance, would you rather have 100,000 users on an insecure system, or 20,000 on a secure system? Which is more valuable? which puts your reputation at risk? What business are you engaged in?
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:23:09
No one is technical enough
@_date: 2014-10-31 07:03:46
Trust them to be competent? 
@_date: 2014-10-30 02:22:21
One important thing to note here is that the client side code is delivered to your browser every time you visit the site by Coinbase, this can be changed at any point even for a few a minutes and then switched back on the server, by a hacker, coinbase or authorities. At anytime in the future code can be delivered to your browser so that when you decrypt your key it is sent somewhere else. Or even more simply, replace the address when you send.
Unless code is open source and delivered via a trusted and signed delivery system, I would have little faith. One example of this would be  an open sourced Chrome App with the code base signed- even then it is not perfect, but pretty good.
@_date: 2014-11-15 21:45:20
Let's say authorities are tracking transactions on the blockchain, you end up being mixed with someone they are investigating , so they follow all leads linked to that transaction- all inputs and outputs
@_date: 2014-10-25 22:08:17
did you read the pastebin or just the abstract i posted on reddit?
@_date: 2014-11-15 09:11:06
Exactly, the focus needs to be on security first, privacy second. I expect in 2 years time there will be privacy features as standard implemented as described and most likely even more innovation will happen for protecting privacy. 
Stealth addresses are great, coin mixing etc. not sure if this will become a standard for business activity as you have no idea what transactions you are being mixed with.
@_date: 2014-10-26 03:07:30

@_date: 2014-10-30 08:07:19
If this was the standard way of detecting things I could send down a key and encrypt the data and send it back as normal
@_date: 2014-10-25 22:12:35
i am pretty sure it is patent-able if you have have the right lawyer
it is a replacement for current cash-on-delivery systems

Reposting criticism of this business model:
My problem with this business model is the following two points. Lets assume the person buying the goods for you is a carder. (You can argue over the percentages of carders on the site, but lets assume its non-zero)
1. Amazon has no idea the transaction is originating from the service and so can't factor this into it's fraud detection algorithm. There is also no way for the service to get feedback from amazon regarding which purchases were done by carders and which weren't. By definition the service cannot provide statistics on fraud. For all you know Amazon and the CC companies are eating it, and you and the recipient of the goods are non the wiser.
2. And most importantly, the person receiving the goods is solving major problems for the carder. The problems are:
*An address to send the stolen goods to
*A liquid market to receive cash for stolen goods.
The person receiving the goods has no idea how many times her address has been used for fraud, and has no way of knowing at what point it might trigger an investigation or police knocking on her door. (as I believe has already happened with purse.io)
Now I know the usual comeback is to pull out some statistics about the sites only having a 0.2% fraud rate, but as I pointed out in point 
1, all that risk is allocated to Amazon, so you have very little data on it.
There is no way I could ever recommend any of these services to people, or use it myself. Imagine you recommend it to your wife's friend and then her door gets kicked in by the cops because over the past year her address has been used by carders on 4 different occasions out of 50 or something. (the carder also gets to see your name and city I believe)
This is a cute little game on the system, but ultimately you profit from allocating risk to Amazon / CC companies and legal risk to your customers, with at least the second one being immoral in my opinion unless the risks are correctly laid out (and you don't have the data to do this)
@_date: 2015-01-22 05:07:45

Perhaps, on the other hand Japan is incredibly well banked and carrying large amounts of cash isn't much of a problem as there is no crime.
There are tonnes of payment systems integrated with mobiles already, eg. Rakuten / Edy and JRs suica. People can charge these up with cash and spend at most places. You can even get home chargers which attach to your computer and charge up your phone/card directly from your bank account.  
The payment companies hold their cash for them, and they can spend instantly at most places. If this were implemented using Bitcoin the payment companies would lose the cash deposits, so I'm not sure they are incentivised to implement this, unless they wan't to hold bitcoin on behalf of the customer and i'm not sure why they would want to do this.
Credit cards are not so popular and are normally not used for borrowing (although this is becoming less so). When you use a credit card in Japan they ask you how many payments you want to make per purchase, if you say "one time", you pay the whole thing off the next month. People use credit cards here to accumulate points really.
Some merchants, including my local restaurant charge a 5% fee if you use a credit card!
Perhaps mobile in-gaming payments would be a huge market for Bitcoin in Japan.

Sure, just pointing out that they are not delivered over the web into a browser and so could be categorized as desktop apps, albeit downloaded via google/mozilla/microsoft's signed content delivery system rather than downloading from a website and manually verifying the signature on the binaries.
Similar to iOS / Apple store etc.
@_date: 2015-03-04 12:15:00
The main reason to deploy as a chrome app vs via the web is security. Chrome apps run in a sand boxed environment and have a content security policy that prevents the vast majority of attacks software delivered over the web into a browser are susceptible to.
They also provide a signed delivery mechanism for the code, so that the signature is verified by chromium else the app won't load.
Native apps are obviously the ultimate in terms of freedom and control over the OS, however general users will probably not verify the signatures on the binaries they download, leaving them open to attack.

Well, if a MIM attack was successful they could manipulate the values on the unspent outputs to cause trouble e.g. cause the payment of excess mining fees or zero mining fees.
They could also block broadcast to the network with certain attacks.

SPV with certain Bloom filter implementations are not so private.
With a private server you are trusting a known entity with your privacy and communicating over an encrypted channel. With SPV you are trusting your privacy to an unknown and communicating in the clear.
You are also depending on port 8333 being open on the wi-fi network you are on, and also that someone isn't MIM-ing this.
Connecting to a private server is instant, SPV clients need to sync headers with the blockchain.

Hi, I looked at the spec and have the following concerns:
1. What is to stop Mallory taking the 10 character address prefix, generating a dead address based on this with a valid checksum, and maliciously disrupting the transaction via a MIM attack?
2. What is to stop someone tricking the customer with a tag such as Starbucks_ instead of Starbucks, and hoping that 1/10 people click the wrong one?
Unless I've missed something, this doesn't look secure enough to be adopted as a standard.
