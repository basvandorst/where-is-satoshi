I doubt it. most likely the price inflated due the one year anniversary of The Big One and now due to the recent events with that strange guy who claims to have cornered the market has probably shaken some people's confidence in the currency. 
I suspect that the price will either remain chaotic with no clear trend of up or down over the next few months or it'll be going down the next few months to find a new stable level. 
Either way, the short term future of BitCoin couldn't be more unsure and I wouldn't bet on it reaching any price point.

Well the problem is that if the game is popular, bitcoins are basically removed from the economy. I mean let's say it sell 100k copies, suddenly 400k bitcoins are removed from circulation, assuming every copy is then installed after purchase and has 1 coin sent to the developer. If enough games use it because we know that most people don't install their games over and over, over time it will just make some bitcoin vanish from existence as people simply lose them to the digital nether realm so to say.
More over this is an extremely expensive drm method. I mean 1 bitcoin is right now with 5-6 dollars, so the total value of the game is actually 20-30 dollars, as in the developers has to pay that amount just to ship the game as the bitcoin would have to come with the game. Of course you could fix this by simply using 0.01 bitcoin or 0.000001 bitcoin. Then you're dealing with expenses many orders of magnitude smaller but that would have the effect of not being a very worthwhile future source of revenue.

I'd say it's unlikely. Plenty of people are probably not that worried about Pirates actions unless they've "invested" in his ponzi scheme. Most I think are far more optimistic about this new debitcard-thing from BitInstant which will undoubtedly create a huge amount of uses.

The person who wrote this article is quite frankly an idiot.


Yes it is possible for something to be a good investment and a bad currency, just look at something like, I dunno,  carrots. The reason why we don't use carrots as currency is because they are shit currency. People eat them, new ones literarely grow out of the ground, etc. However the price of carrots can go up, thus making it a good investment. 
Whether something is a good currency isn't reflected by it's tendency to increase in value. It's not that changes in prices make for a bad economy, just that when you can't even make a 90% estimate of what the value of BitCoin will be in a month, you've got a problem on your hand. These wild exchange rates do make it hard to anyone to run a business using BitCoin.


An economy is a system where people exchange goods and services between each other. That isn't happening right now with BitCoin, or rather it isn't happening on any large scale. People that use BitCoin only tend to use it as a kind of place holder for dollars or some other currency. They set all their prices in dollars and the price changes when the exchange rate differs. After they've gotten more BitCoin, they don't really do anything with it. They can't pay their bills with it, they can't buy more goods to sell, they can't pay their staff and so on. The only thing they can do is sell it for dollars. So there isn't really any BitCoin economy. Just speculators and the occasional business.

Exactly, all fiat currencies have that on them, including BitCoin!. Otherwise it's not a fiat currency. People simply won't accept money without this sentence. s

Well, fiat currencies are sort of faith based and held together mainly by circular reasoning.
@_date: 2011-10-24 11:30:12
Thanks for pointing that out, but what exactly does it mean? People are signing up, mining and then selling huge portions of it rather that hoarding it? It makes sense I suppose.

No, the reason why it went so high was because people heard about Silk Road. 
Silk Road caused a huge surge in demand over a short period of time, new buys didn't care what the price was because the price of the product that they were actually buying, the drugs, were still priced in dollars. For example even if the price of Bitcoins doubled overnight, the price of weed doesn't. 
Then once the fever died down and the initial wave of people had finished with their drug money, it quickly reset to more balanced levels at around 15 dollars or so, which was still a doubling from the pre-silk road price, simply because people now knew about BitCoin and demand had still grown faster than the supply. Sure there were massive sell-offs, yes, but a lot of it was just coincidential in my opinion. The crash would have happened sooner or later, BitCoin was overpriced by at least a factor of 2.
@_date: 2011-08-15 22:09:10
Honestly the main problem is simply the fact that the value of bitcoin changes wildly over short periods of time
I mean when I first heard about Bitcoin it was at 5 dollars, then suddenly everyone knew about it after the whole SilkRoad craze and suddenly the value rose quickly to 30 dollars, then it crashed down to 5 again before recovering to 15. That's in the matter of something like two months or so. All of that makes it very very very hard to use the stuff.

Day traders are people that try to make money by trading BitCoin. Buy low, sell high, repeat all day, every day.
This day trading can be percieved to cause the suddenly rise and fall of BitCoin.
Basically these guys want BitCoin to be stable in it's price so that they don't suddenly lose a bunch of money. I mean imagine being a SilkRoad dealer back in May, you'd be selling crazy amounts of drugs as new buyers streamed in. Then suddenly, the price of BitCoin slams down to 5 dollar. Basically every single trade they did above 5USD:1BTC was essentially costing them money.
Sure they still have the money in form of BitCoin, but it's going to take a long time for BitCoin to go back to 10 or 20 dollars.
@_date: 2011-09-20 13:29:14
I think that the exchange market has basically purged itself of all non-believers at this point. FOr weeks those that had no faith in BitCoin just sold and sold, pushing the price ever downward, eventually these people ran out of money and only people that buy are left and the result is soaring prices.
@_date: 2011-09-07 18:31:36
No we aren't talking about carrots, we are talking about currencies and what makes them shit currency. Carrots are bad because of various kinds of intrinsic properties of carrots while BitCoin is a terrible currency because of it's wild exchange rates.
Just because either of the two as risen in value doesn't mean that they are good currencies even though it does make them good investments. There is a different and if you can't understand it, I seriously hope you aren't planning on making any money long term in BitCoin.
@_date: 2011-09-07 19:54:53
Right now BitCoin is LOSING it's value. Just look at the charts over a 5 months period of time. Went from &lt;1 to 30 then it's been crashing and sliding down ever since.
Why would someone want to deal with a currency that has lost four fifths of it's value over a period of a few months.
The demand went up and then down. There are no signs that it's ever going to recover to May 2011 levels. 
Secondly what the image was refering to is the fact that you're assuming that whatever trend is current will keep going forever. Meaning you're literarely saying "BitCoin is growing and therefore it will keep growing." which is completely insane seeing that right now BitCoin is shrinking.
@_date: 2011-08-27 19:13:17
Exactly, if something like MyBitCoin happened to a regular bank or investment firm of similar relative importance to the economy as MyBitCoin is/was to the BitCoin market, the financial system could crash. And yeah, it did almost did when virtually the same thing happened in 2008 when people realized that Lehman had lost a huge portion of it's assets due to the housing market crashing, which is sort of has the same effect as someone stealing everything only worse because when someone steals the money it still, you know, exists and all that. 
Pretty much everything that has happened in the financial system since 2008 has been due to a huge sum of money and faith in the system instantly vanishing.
