Next to impossible? Maybe back in the early days and there are privacy coins that exist today, but with AML/KYC it is becoming next to impossible to transact anonymously for the average Joe. Most newcomers to crypto are using on-ramps like Coinbase, which makes proving someone owns Bitcoin very simple. 
At least in the United States, they could shut the shit down in pretty hardcore fashion if they wanted to. I'm not saying they will make it impossible to fool with crypto. But I remember how difficult they made it for online poker players when they decided to close the doors on that shit. If you weren't tech savvy and hip to Bitcoin, you were pretty much finished playing online for real money. I suppose you could've used a VPN and found a way to sneak around and play on the main poker sites and I'm sure many players did. But they shut that shit down overnight for the vast majority of players. It was just game over.

lolol Because they have their fucking hands around your throat and have your entire life, and they wish to continue this stranglehold forever. They want to strangle your children and your grandchildren, just like they've strangled your grandfathers before you. That's the challenge. How can they continue to strangle the people if the people have access to money that can't be controlled?

I think that would be amazing and I'm all for it. But to suggest that a company like Kroger could abandon Visa and start accepting Bitcoin without taking massive losses is just fantasy at this time. I'm hopeful for the future, though.

It's true. People rarely even talk about deeper possibilities with crypto/blockchain. Its all about the money. At some point it will be much bigger than that. Things like voting.. could be done on the blockchain securely. That's game changing. Why even have a central government if the people have a public ledger that can't be changed? Even taxes could be incorporated into this public chain. No need for a Senate or House or any of that, the people can simply cast their votes for whatever issues are at hand. We don't need any representatives at all. I'm not sure governments would like this lol But its all possible now.

I'm not claiming any one coin to be the best coin. The technology is constantly improving and progressing. Right now, I'm a big fan of some of the MimbleWimble coins. But it's a fact that Bitcoin was the first. 
Some classic cars have crazy monetary value. A quick Google search told me that a 1955 Jaguar D-Type sold for nearly $22 million dollars at auction. Sure, less than 100 were made. But we're talking about a god damn car designed to win some race, not the first decentralized currency in human history.

No fucking way.

Who knows what the future holds?  There will only ever be 21 million coins. In the history of mankind. Forever. 1000 years from now. The only thing that will stop Bitcoin is the collapse of civilization itself. Otherwise, it will go on forever. 
So, fuck yea, way more risky.

@_date: 2019-02-06 15:08:55
You should seize the opportunity and teach 'em a thing or two about bitcoin. Refer 'em to coinbase, collect your $10 or whatever the hell the referral is. Introduce them to crypto. Not for the money, but just to be taking initiative when opportunities present themselves and to support crypto in general. It might take more time than I'd like to spend to bring this person up to speed, though. They seem a bit ....dull.
@_date: 2019-02-06 14:21:19
This was my take on it, as well. And it makes me feel very bullish towards crypto, specifically bitcoin itself. I don't know what will happen with any of the other coins that are out there already or the ones that will arrive in the future. But I believe that the original BTC will still be around long after I am dead and gone. I want to accumulate as much of it as I possibly can so that maybe if I am lucky my progeny won't have to deal with the pressures of poverty. Less than 21 million coins. Billions of people. I'm not a smart man... but I'm putting everything I can spare into bitcoin. I hope the price creeps down further. It won't stay there for long. This could be the last opportunity to get in relatively cheap.

Idk about you guys... but selling drugs in Mexico seems like an astronomically risky proposition. Especially if you are a white guy from the US...

It seems far more farfetched to me that naysayers like you still exist when the world has witnessed the rise of Bitcoin from being worth nothing to being worth thousands of dollars per coin, spawning an entire crypto-economy with thousands of coins and an overall marketcap of currently around 250 BILLION dollars.

I wish I had that kind of money where I could just start clicking shit and buying things without reading what I am purchasing. I'd probably use it to save the whales or something though..
I went to bitcoin .com just now, clicked on "buy bitcoin now", and there is literally zero confusion involved in the process, at least for me. Yes, they default it to BCH, but everything is clearly labeled and I'm not seeing any trickery whatsoever. Please point me to where these people are getting confused with this process because honestly I am finding it hard to believe right now as I'm testing it on my end...
@_date: 2019-04-13 18:57:59
I see what you are saying and I won't say it's not possible but I do not think they're intentionally trying to trick people. It's just how the cards fell. The games been played for awhile now, many moons. Shit happens. Roger and his team must not carry the same hate as others or there would be no BTC option for purchase at all. I'd probably call it trickery, then.
@_date: 2019-04-13 18:13:54
Tricked, though? Did it trick you? I'm assuming it didn't. I know it didn't trick me. Why is anyone else responsible for another person's stupidity or lack of due diligence? I will admit that the whole domain situation doesn't really taste well in my mouth either! But I don't think it's an intentional thing to trick anyone. I think it's just how the cards fell. I'm not sure what we can expect him to do about it. Sell the domain? Use it to push a project he no longer believes in? Or do what he is doing.
@_date: 2019-04-28 17:01:24
It's really like taking steps backwards and forwards at the same time. Coinbase is moonwalking. And that shouldn't get anyone excited. Part of the reason Coinbase exists in the first place is because of the community's desire to escape the banking system. But they're not gonna let that happen easily in the US. Thus, they've got Coinbase by the balls. Such is the fate of any entity seeking to do it the "right way", particularly in the US... Decentralized everything is the only real way. Fuck everything else.
@_date: 2019-04-26 16:46:33
Yea, you need to go on and get in there. I guess the main thing to consider now is which way to go. You could run through that 20k pretty quick if you're buying new hardware on either side of the spectrum. The new miners are expensive, the new GPUs are expensive. So you can build a rig or 2, right, but you won't have a farm like in the picture. It will be much smaller, but also much more powerful and efficient if you go with a newer model set up. 
At your electricity rates, even S9's are profitable. They're cheap used, you could build a big ass farm with 20k. I'm not certain which way would be more profitable, though. Newer hardware or old. The old may prove to pay for itself faster and put you into the green overall faster because of the cheap used prices right now. Idk. But this is the kind of shit you need to be considering at this point. 
I'd love to know where in the world and how in the world you've secured those rates... Ijs.

Idk, man. He bought the domain. He can do with it whatever he wants. If people are fooled by this, maybe they should stick to dollar bills and having their hand held. You think it's an intentional thing to fool people? I think it just happened like that and it is what it is. What do you want him to do? Give the domain away? lol
People talk a lot of shit about the guy but I think he's following his heart for the most part.

I don't think you'll ever be at peace with it until you stop caring so much about converting people to your religion, so to speak. You sound like some kind of god damn missionary or something. An evangelist. Just let people do what they want. Fuck it if they don't get it. You're not gonna save them. If you were already rich as fuck and devoting your time to converting people over to crypto, then I could understand. But it sounds like you've just got your feet wet last year. Now you wanna tell everybody in the fucking world.
It's also not even bright to expose yourself like that in the first place. Those same people could come for your coin one day. They know you got it.

Well, that sucks about your friends. I'm not in favor of people getting screwed over, regardless of my username. I sure hope they're prepared if they jump into some of the more intricate things they could get into. I fear they may lose 100% if they get into dapps, tokens, shit like metamask, ect... The general public isn't ready. 
I looked at it again just now. Maybe there's a few things that stand out and I'm not a huge fan of... like how it says "Buy Bitcoin - Purchase BCH or BTC" but yet defaults to BCH, which is not Bitcoin! Maybe it is SLIGHTLY deceptive but i wouldn't say highly. It's possible it's just an honest mistake but I really doubt that. It's strategic, alright. But I wouldn't go so far as to call it a scam. The folks at bitcoin.com aren't responsible for people's level of understanding. It's just solid business strategy to push the things they believe in and support first. At least the option to purchase BTC is there for those who are able to distinguish between the two. 
It probably is bizarre that I'm all over the place defending this shit lol I don't really have a dog in the fight. I do hold and mine both BTC and BCH, but I'm just some sort of maniac talking reckless.

@_date: 2019-04-13 18:35:54
I'm not calling them stupid but it's quite clear through deductive logic that they are either stupid or did not pay attention at the time of purchase.
I'm asking again, like, show me where it's so confusing. I want to believe you but you're making it hard for me to do. I'm on the site, I'm primed to purchase crypto, and I see zero confusion between purchasing BCH or BTC. The only thing is, bitcoin .com defaults to purchase BCH. That is their right to do. I don't have an issue with that. Show me where there's confusion. I'm still on the site.

There aren't enough believers to stop the downward trend. Like you, I won't sell, but the price is still going down much further in my opinion. I'm not upset about it. I think its beautiful. Its the last time the cycle will dip low enough for the common man to buy a full coin without risking everything. Once this cycle is finished, crypto is going to blossom in a major way. People who thought they weren't early adopters will be considered early adopters. The real early adopters will be the richest people on the planet. Maybe the world will even change for the better. This shit is exciting!! (The price is likely to skyrocket upward now that I've called for lower prices)

I don't think its the last time but I do think its one of the last dips that will be low enough for poor people to buy a full coin. I think this because I saw it go from a few guys at work talking about a pizza being bought with magic internet money to then it was worth like $18 and then eventually to $1000. Then I saw it go back down to I believe under $100 again. Later it recovered to above $1000 and peaked around $20k. The next ebb and flow should take us into the stratosphere as far as price. As a believer, once that happens I don't think it will ever dip this low again. With all that being said, I also think the current downward trend is going to continue for a bit longer.

We're not talking about a social network or advancement in smart phones. Changes in the monetary foundations of the world take time. Especially ones with the potential to disrupt the status quo. It took them a long time to get us by the balls as they have us... they won't just release the grip without a fight to the death. Bitcoin has persisted for 10 years while the wealthiest people in the world have attempted to destroy it by various methods, all of which have failed thus far. Either you believe, or you don't. It's gonna be awhile and I'm fine with that. Soon we won't have opportunities like today where a poor man can still buy a full bitcoin. Later on, this won't even be a remote possibility.

There are 7.5 billion people on Earth and 17.3 million of them are millionaires. There will only be 21 million bitcoins to ever exist. Many of those have been lost, possibly several million BTC. If every millionaire on Earth wanted to buy 1 bitcoin, it is not mathematically possible and cannot happen. Edit: It may be mathematically possible if enough coins haven't been lost and enough people sell the coin they currently hold. 
Cryptocurrency is going to be the defacto form of currency for the world at some point in the future. I am not saying bitcoin will be the one. It very well may be some other coin, Stellar or Ripple for example or perhaps some coin that hasn't been developed yet.
Bitcoin will always be the original. If nothing else, it will be a very expensive collectible. Incredibly expensive.
You have to remember that if civilization does not collapse... these coins will be alive long after we're dead and gone. Your descendants may end up enjoying the fruits of your hodling 500 years from now.

Cryptocurrency isn't going anywhere and can't be stopped, short of civilization collapse, at which point your fiat will be almost as equally worthless as my crypto. You could at least wipe your ass with it, I could not. So you do have a slight advantage if the world falls apart. Otherwise, you are going to eventually lose. It is a mathematical certainty. Again, maybe I will not be the one to benefit. That's fine with me. The thought that I am doing things that will some day benefit my descendants who I will never meet or speak to in my lifetime, but I will perhaps have a direct influence on their lives and make things easier for them in the future...... that shit makes my mohterfucking blood boil, son.

This is long as fuck and I don't even know why I took it there but here it is......
We all come from different backgrounds and whatnot but from my experience in poor, rural America... Personal computers with modems and/or Internet connections were basically unheard of pre-1994. Before that, only like 1 kid in my entire childhood memory had a personal computer at all and Internet wasn't even a word yet to anyone in my world. So there was no Internet, but my rich kid friend did have Leisure Suit Larry and King's Quest and I was at his house constantly because my family couldn't afford a computer at that point. The schools did not have Internet service and before around 1995 they only had ancient computers like Osborne's and stuff like that, if they had any computers at all, and they were only used to play games like Hangman and Oregon Trail. They didn't even try to teach us shit. No typing classes, nothing at that time. Just Hangman and fucking Oregon Trail, once a week for like 15 minutes each student or some shit like that. They only had like 15 computers for the entire school and that was awesome, because most schools did not have any computers at all. We moved a lot. All rural, poverty stricken areas, several different states.
An interesting side note, one school district decided to be cutting edge and offer home schooling to their problem students to get rid of them and keep them from influencing their perfect farmer students to do undesirable shit. In doing this, they were a little too relaxed with their methods and the dial up Internet login details somehow made their way to my Packard Bell 133mhz Pentium powerhouse and I used their Internet connection for several years, entirely for free, until the point where DSL and cable modems took over the scene. My entire early Internet experience was a direct result of that shit. Without that stolen login info, I would absolutely not be where I am right now in life. Thank you, stupid fucking teachers who wanted to get rid of kids who didn't fit into your fucking hick hillbilly god damn mold.

Fuck, you're right. I need to see the gunsmith and exchange some dope for guns and ammo.
Or maybe have one of the girls go in there and handle the gunsmith like that, a little barter and trade.
Good idea, mate. Fucking A, right.

So arm yourself with drugs and whores.
@_date: 2019-09-01 03:08:44
Drugs and whores will be my game. 
People are still gonna want to get high and fuck regardless, I think.
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:15:19
lmao! flawless.

1989-1992 is my guess for this. 
One of us will be correct.

How, Sway?
They got that quantum level dope, huh. 
Gonna try to brute force Bitcoin like they brute force the world. 
I guess we will see.

Of course it will survive. Most of the hashpower is in China and spread throughout the world. Is some world police going to come shut every miner down on the planet? No... they're not. It will survive regardless, short of worldwide collapse of crucial infrastructure such as electricity. Even then, I'm not an expert but I believe the blockchain could simply pick up where it left off. There is no "death". It would just be dormant until the next block is found :) Maybe that block would be found by some alien race far in the future. Maybe bitcoin becomes their currency lol :) you fucking simpleton you. Go smoke some weed. Do some drugs. Live some life. And stop trying to infect people with your defeatism. Go lay down by yourself somewhere like the dirty defeated dog that you are lol I'm joking. I don't wish you harm at all, it just sounded kind of funny in my conscious stream so fuck it, there it is.
Godspeed to you, friend. Good luck.
Edit: I could very well be wrong about that dormant block shit. Again, I'm far from an expert lol More of a crook... I'm not sure at all what would happen with the 10 minute block structure and all that if electricity worldwide suddenly stopped and there were zero miners trying to find the block. Might be the end. Idk. Some smart guy should chime in who actually knows what the fuck they're talking about lol That guy is not me.

Well, that's unsettling. 
They took the fucking gold. They can do what they want. 
Only option would be to relocate, I guess. 
Adios, Amigo.

Less supply + Greater demand = Motherfucking Moon Shot, son.

I closed my eyes while reading your comment and I see a field full of crypto-sponsored cars!!! The whole field is full of cars sponsored by different crypto projects. Where doge broke the mold and allowed a trickle into the stream, the flood gates will bust open soon and every god damn race we will see at least 10 cryptocars! There will be fans from Alabama who don't know shit about Ethereum but they love their god damn ETH car!!

Some machines do, some don't. I have too much shit going on to keep track. But I will say that if they're willing to report on Bitcoin, I will remove my condom and watch it while being raped by ads every single time.
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:08:23
Just that first one, I think? It turned out to be nowhere near as ad infested as I expected.
Short segment though, and I guess that's it? That and some 3 minute 'Who Is Satoshi' thing. Not bad. Could've been better but not bad.

Tony Robbins can't fuck with @_date: 2018-12-15 20:11:01

God damn, you aren't joking. I'm like 15 seconds in, motherfucker mentions Charlie Shrem and instantly I'm hit with a long ass ad that I cannot skip lol fuckkkk

Bring your bears and force them to join us high on the tight rope.
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:28:24
Eh, Idk if I'd call them smart... maybe not as dumb as others? Cuz it's gonna be awhile, buddy.
@_date: 2018-12-23 19:07:35
Yes, bitcoin still makes my dick hard.
It is a miracle. A sight to behold.
@_date: 2019-05-18 23:52:23
Thank you.
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:37:29
Ol' Vosk tried to keep him a miner, huh? Went through some hard times lol
@_date: 2018-12-23 19:09:25
His bald head is sooooo smooth. I wanna spread my butt cheeks on him and let one loose.
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:40:08
The headline of that article is such a crock of bullshit. The writer should be fired on the spot.
And the dumb fucks who believe this nonsense all deserve to remain poor when crypto really takes hold.
Stupidity does not earn sympathy from me.
@_date: 2018-12-09 08:05:42
lol That machine would never be returned if I managed that Apple store.
It never even came into our office. No idea what he's talking about.

You KNOW it's gonna crash again
