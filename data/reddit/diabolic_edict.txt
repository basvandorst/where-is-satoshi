Not how things work, but keep thinking that.

Do you really believe that if you're caught hiring someone to commit murder, if the murder doesn't happen then you're not liable for any criminal charges? What a dumb comment.

It was all taken into consideration in the charges against him as a drug kingpin. They didn't need to prosecute him separately. What's really rich is the chat logs they found from his computer logged in as admin clearly show that he was indeed trying to seriously hire someone to commit murder, yet you people still try and pretend it's some conspiracy or that he would have won the case if they did decide to take him to court over it.

Because they were taken into consideration from his charges as a drug kingpin and ultimately factored into his sentencing. He was guilty and caught red handed.

Stop. He isn't some martyr or a remotely good person.

Like getting caught red handed logged into the admin account of Dread Pirate Roberts with complete chat logs and blockchain information for the bitcoin payments to purchase the hit? Oof.

It's almost as if the verifiable FACTS surrounding his ordered hits was taken into consideration in the case against him as a drug kingpin. They didn't need to charge and prosecute him separately. Do you know what a RICO is?

1. He was the owner of the account.
2. Yes, after they tracked him down and caught him red handed logged into the admin page. 
3. Stop saying this dumb shit. You can be charged with a crime for hiring a hitman to murder someone. No one dying doesn't mean you're off scott free if caught. 
4. He wasn't charged because they didn't need to do so. The fact that he was caught red handed trying to hire a hitman to murder someone (and was tricked into believing he'd done so) were taken into account against him in court as being a drug kingpin. Do you know what a RICO case is? 
5. He didn't receive his sentence based on the conspiracy to commit murder facts alone. 
He's a piece of shit and so are his dumb supporters.
