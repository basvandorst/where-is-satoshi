Because when help comes it's defeated by the past helpers.

You tell me. That's where the crux lies.

I agree to this. Very sensible. We should always test the waters of these exchanges how deep they are.

It's because the lack of conviction that people yet have for Bitcoin. They read 100 articles in which some show btc having no intrinsic value hence they fear and back out. They will only get into the price when price soars to newer highs. Kind of assurance.

Excellent work. Thank you.

Wrong. It's bitmex and cboe. Paper btc as fractional reserve has caused this. Since btc can be traded as a leverage paper btc no one knows the circulation. I'm sure bitmex itself doesn't know it. I don't understand how do they peg the futures to existing btc supply. This is what has caused a turmoil in btc and ETH both. This should be stopped. They have ruined this asset class.

Seems too good to be true.

What if belfrics nails you on a higher order. What if it's a scam site. Like they get u in confidence doing nothing initially , gain your trust and the next big order that they feel is sizeable they axe you.

How do u send btc to belfrics? 
@_date: 2019-01-14 04:20:37
Yes but how do u send the USD to coinbase

Very well said. But the fact that governments are trying to destroy its value in the helm is more agonising. I seriously see a problem when an intact in supply inflationary in quantity is having a fractional reserve. Its the same about any of us doing insider trading. The fact that cboe and CME are doing paper trading added to Bitcoin nature is ridiculous. That's why any of us will never have a real value defined to btc.

Via what mechanism would you know what amount of physical btc is being held by cboe or CME to issue an x multiplier of paper Bitcoins. For that matter even bitmex. No one knows that. They could be as wicked and evil as having one tenth of a physical Bitcoin and having futures traded of a full one. For bitmex I think that shit owns nothing. It's purely the deposits of peoples btc that lose which goes to the winners. So it's an ugly game yeah. Look at the example of gold. That's enough to understand this concept. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:04:12
No its just a cash contract without any btc held. Why do u think its falling. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:39:24
It's got nothing to do with stable coins. It's only the futures and non stop issuance of unlimited paper btc contracts. Think of it as paper money today and it's countless printing. The more money is printed the more inflation will happen and devaluation. The same applies to btc. Same happened with gold. They don't want btc to be dominant over USD. Simple
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:46:50
Cash settled contracts by CME cboe unlike baakt that would hold a physical btc for trading a derivative of btc. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:20:45
All of it is paper btc. Bitfinex, bitmex, cboe and cme
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:31:28
Price remains subdued for longer time. See gold. A commodity scarce in totality and where its at since futures started. That's why I call for a protest against all of these exchanges destroying a niche asset class for their fear and instability.

Then why post it here.
