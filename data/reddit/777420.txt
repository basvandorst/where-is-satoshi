Why dont you leak the full story anonymously ? Ever used the internet before? Oh right, you wont get any fame or blog post hits from that...

And falling for one of the most classic text book scams in the book (cant talk bc traveling, front me a large amount of money, etc.).
Sorry for your loss OP. Wise up!

@_date: 2014-02-27 14:49:25
Leak the full story anonymously = 
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:48:58
If he was smart he could leak the full story anonymously using TOR Browser and etc but that wouldnt get him any internet fame.

You would leak the full story anonymously if you really cared about the Bitcoin community. BUT all you care about is internet fame and hits to you blog so you wont. Please kindly go fuck yourself.
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:41:51
lol this is a pretty stupid idea honestly...Why wouldn't you send it off to be recovered? Thats like having 5k of gold stuck in a safe you dont have a key for and not doing anything about it because you dont want to spend $ on a locksmith. GL w your hdd.
@_date: 2014-03-11 06:13:13
well we all know how Theymos + donations (thousands of BTC) to improve bitcointalk forum went... I bet Karpeles and him would get along great. With 6k BTC, he could hire some of the best programmers..

I have a 7970. I use it to mine with Multipool to make the most out of it. Does well and stays around 614 KH/s. I leave it running 24/7. Mining BTC/LTC with it is sorta pointless atm since you can make more mining other currencies.

This is my main problem with QR codes. they are not big in the US. I read some article that said about only 10% of US users know what to do when they see a QR code. They are used mainly for shipping and inventory here in the US. The EU is all about QR codes.

its mostly beggars asking for money. They spam out 1000s of wallet IDs with their message to get a few people that believe their message and send them some $. power in numbers/volume.
