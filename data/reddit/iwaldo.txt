As far as I know I didn't, I would have asked for GBP if I was asked. Strange really, but I don't see myself using this card if the fees that was posted earlier are true.

Got an email too! Can't wait to try it

It's good if you expect a high volume of bitcoin sales, because currently their minimum GBP payout is £1000. They're hoping to reduce it soon though.

Haha maybe I was just too eager, just seemed too much of a coincidence that I ordered a prepaid card and got that a few days later. It asks for your DOB to activate. 
No harm if its not Xapo not like I gave them any other details anyway.

Sometimes tapping your balance at the top of the screen updates it.

Does anyone have any pictures of this implanted?
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:08:25
This looks fucking ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-08-02 16:54:48
I'm in the UK
@_date: 2014-08-02 13:53:17
Thanks! Thought they might have gave me more info with it
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:43:47
Pretty cool, what about removal? Would you have to go to your doctor for it?
@_date: 2014-08-02 13:41:17
Not bad thanks! Exif data? Haha
@_date: 2014-08-02 14:44:06
Ah, that's pretty cool.

Have to say, I'm glad I don't have a business in NYC.

Thanks, think I've been round them all now, the best we can get so far is either £10 per withdrawal to our bank account, or wait til we process £1000 worth and pay 1% transaction fee on every order.
Either that or we try and sell it ourselves, but it gets messy trying to tie up orders if the exchange rate goes lower than what we sold it for in the bitcoin equivalent. 
Plus just trying to get my boss to agree to accept bitcoin is hard enough without having to explain all this to him!
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:02:23
^ Exactly this. Even like £200 minimum would be a huge benefit!

I spoke to BitPay yesterday about this
"We spoke with the finance team and we anticipate some possible changes to our GBP banking relationship within the next few months. Please feel free to explore the BTC payout option and reach back out to us if you have any further questions."
It's really the only thing holding back us accepting bitcoin at the moment, unless anyone knows any other payment processors that have a lower limit?

both countries are the same household voltage (230v) all you would need to do is cut off/remove the EU plug and re-wire with a UK 3 pin plug, simple :)

Bitbargain.co.uk is good and really quick, it is a bit higher than average though. bought .4 btc earlier 
@_date: 2016-06-24 07:25:33
Is it a good idea to buy BTC just now?
@_date: 2016-09-16 17:25:09
This sounds like last nights Mr Robot episode...
