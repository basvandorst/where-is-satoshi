I would emphasise that I'm not for or against the technology, I just think there will be consequences many don't anticipate. You're right of course, tools for anonymity are already available, this just makes it effectively ubiquitous. One upside of course is it should stop people following stolen coins through very large numbers of hops and claiming wherever they end up is who stole them (as opposed to the much more likely scenario that they received them from whichever exchange the thief dumped the coins via)

Given Bitcoin can handle ~300k transactions/day at the moment because of the block size limit, there's some really huge pieces of the puzzle missing at the very least. They've talked about a micropayments system, but are there any details of it, and as I've said elsewhere, if I'm mining, then paying my mined Bitcoin to 21 Inc in aggregate payments, who then handle the micropayments... why don't I just send them $5 on a credit card?
Also, block rewards are constant, so the more 21 Inc devices, the less each mines. Until June each block produces 25 BTC, after that it will be 12.5 BTC. So call it $5,000 of Bitcoin created every 10 minutes. That means about $21,900,000 per month as a total value pool available. If they sell a million, absolute maximum possible to mine if every other miner stopped would be $21.90/month. If they sell 10 million, maximum $2.19/month.
At a billion, each device could trickle in at most $0.02/month.

For the record, I'm an ex computer scientist that does contribute to a number of cryptocurrency projects (including having commit rights on an altcoin), and my target is about 3%. That's a number as "value when purchased", generally I wouldn't re-balance that part of my portfolio later (so I suspect a lot of those who have a lot in Bitcoin, bought in low and it's increased, rather than they sunk huge parts of their capital into it).

Do you have a link to those numbers? So far haven't seen anything concrete 
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:21:15
Why does it have to be 1:1? Could be 10:1, 1:10, and there was even a suggestion that the ratio could shift so over time you get less "sidecoins" for your Bitcoins (emulating inflation). Only thing you can't do is create more Bitcoins when the coins return (because there's no generation mechanism, just an unlock mechanism for coins which were being moved on another chain).
Beyond that, simplest answer is in the same way you know when you send 1BTC to someone, it will arrive as 1BTC, because that's how the code's written?
@_date: 2015-06-09 08:20:02
Sorry, I should been clearer, I more meant that it's a good time to ask if that's their business model, or if it will be something else.
I'd note Bitcoin Core's devs are funded by MIT rather than the community, right now, but I think Blockstream certainly is likely to find it easier to get donations, and there's almost certainly scope for them to sell consulting services as a model too.

Does it make money or lose it compared to cost of electricity? If it loses it, it's not what I'd call power efficient.


I'll agree with the first part at least


I'd love any numbers on that. Also please remember to take into account the upcoming reward halving, and increasing difficulty due to hashrate of 21 Inc adding new miners (i.e. they're going to compete with themselves if they succeed at scale).


Errr.... given most paywall sites individually charge more than that (i.e. NYT is more like $16  ), not sure that's so reasonable. I get economy of scale and ubiquity, but... no. Also with fees on individual transactions already creeping into the cents level, you might get maybe 100 transactions/month out if you pay $1 in fees and $1 in supporting sites. Even if you aggregate payments to individual sites, do you visit more than 100 sites a month?
Maybe 21 Inc will aggregate payments at a larger scale for me - sure, but in that case why don't I just pay them $2/month rather than spending $10 in electricity?

You're happy with Bitcoin main chain only being usable for very high value transactions then (essentially only those occuring between financial institutions)? Lower bound on current estimates (3 transactions per second) puts it in the same ballpark as CHIPS (US-only and interbank-only), back in 2010 (
The current limit isn't a bit low, it's absurdly low. That this is not yet obvious is a reflection of how tiny a market segment Bitcoin currently has.

As far as I am aware the code is still in development for sidechains, it's just vastly over-sold how fast new technology can be delivered.

I'm apparently behind the times, why am I excited by this?
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:50:42
The main limitation is on interconnectivity and logistics. For Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) to become a global currency, I'd expect to see usage 5-7 orders of magnitude above current levels, so we're talking genuinely staggering numbers of sidechains (although off-chain transaction systems such the [Lightning network]( would likely take much of the load).
There's no strict technical reason why they would have to be separate node software, but I'd imagine they would be for architectural simplicity. That software could co-exist with other nodes on the same physical hardware.
Mining is the main issue, as Bitcoins cannot be created elsewhere. I think the most likely scenario us that the sidechain would merge-mine with Bitcoin main chain (so the same effort is reused for multiple chains), and the transaction fees used to compensate miners for the overheads of running multiple chains (bandwidth, disk and memory usage).
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:51:57
Yup. Certainly the argument has been made that any technical development for the sake of technical development (as opposed to an attempt to make money cunningly disguised as technical development) should now happen as a sidechain.
Edit: Before I make headline news with that statement - I mean _new_ technical work.
@_date: 2015-06-19 11:25:18
I'd presumed we would have a transaction selection criteria language (i.e. min val, max val, in/out ratio cap, min age, max age, min fee, max transaction size, plus any other criteria I haven't thought of) that goes out with each block to help establish which transactions are included. Absolutely we shouldn't try one-size-fits-all for mining policies.
@_date: 2015-06-19 10:52:45
To me, that supports that we need O(1) block propagation, so the time taken to get a block across the network is (reasonably) constant. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 10:41:10
Dogecoin runs with a block rate 10x that of Bitcoin, which IMHO is an acceptable simulation. Early versions derived from Bitcoin Core 0.7/0.8 (via Litecoin) did have scaling issues, but the rewrite around Bitcoin Core 0.9 (directly) helped that massively.
Disk usage is the biggest issue right now, with UTXO space looming on the distant horizon, and we need to look at how to improve both.

We could definitely consider scaling policies. I've been wanting to model what happens if we have a retargetting policy based on a 4% overhead over the last target window (similar to the hard vs soft cap of BIP100). So:
Week n to week n + 2, average transaction payload per block is x bytes
Week n + 2, a new block maximum size is 80 (fixed header) + x * 1.04 bytes
With a hard cap (never exceeded) at 16-32MB to ensure it doesn't get too far out of hand. The intent being to apply enough demand pressure to encourage a fee market, while making it infeasible to inject superblocks (a mining pool would have to constantly mine very large blocks for two weeks to achieve even a slight increase in accepted maximum). Does limit transaction expansion per year to 100% (or thereabouts), but that should be high enough not to cause huge technical issues while also driving demand for scaling solutions to which Bitcoin main chain just acts as a clearance network.

From my point of view at least, it's not  about fees, it's about transactions outright failing and the network being considered unreliable (I know it's not, but functionally it will be). People have to know they can spend their money, and if we consistently fill blocks that requirement fails. Fees merely act as a braking method to delay this.

Interesting, hadn't thought of a sliding ratio. Trying to work out if you'd end up inadvertently burning Bitcoins when you convert back (i.e. you move 1 BTC to the network, and get 1 sidecoin, a year later you move that sidecoin back and now you get 0.95 BTC, where does the rest go?)
Absolutely if people want to experiment they should, I more meant that there's a lot of excitement about sidechains replacing altcoins, and as a general rule I think a lack of consideration of where development effort will come from. It would be great to see more people getting into cryptocurrency development via sidechains, though.

You would have to persuade people to change configuration, but it would readily give those who complain that the developers act as gatekeepers, the tools to effect change. Unfortunately I suspect it would more act as an enabler for people to shoot themselves in the foot, rather than a better consensus process.
Storing configurations in the blockchain wasn't the intent here, but could be done by allowing anyone to contribute a "configuration transaction", and providing users with a method of opting in/out.
Honestly I don't care if there's a leader or not, but the potential for a well regarded security improvement to fail through apathy by miners should be raising flags.
@_date: 2015-06-02 12:26:29
Some sort of "very large block" limit makes sense for the same reason 1MB made sense when it was introduced, but absolutely we need to stop trying to enforce mining incentives on the user-side, and give miners better tools to control these.
Want to mine only 100kb blocks? Sure. Want to mine up to 10mb blocks? Why not. Want to only mine transactions with more inputs than outputs (to shrink UTXO)? Sure. Want to have a more complex model for valuing cost of a transaction (to the miner) vs fee on it? Yes. lets support this stuff.
I'm currently seeing a huge discussion over whether miners have the network bandwidth for bigger blocks, because they're on poor connections (apparently). Surely that's something where change encourages competition and miners have to either get better connections, or (ideally) we'll see incentives for them to not all be clustered in remote parts of China.
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:14:47
There is no number that indicates anything about long term prospects. Cryptocurrency will succeed or fail based on whether it gains adoption, and that depends on making it useful, making it more usable, and marketing it. We need to stop asking when value will go up, and ask what we need to improve to make cryptocurrency more valuable.
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:59:30
There's three main concerns I'm aware of:
1. Bandwidth &amp; disk space usage
2. UTXO (memory) size
3. Fees (or lack thereof)
I've grouped bandwidth and disk space together separately to memory, as they're worsened by bigger blocks, but so far no-one has pointed out an actually critical issue, vs inconvenient. It may make life harder for mining pools, but as long as they have a full node on a good network link, it can then relay block headers to the pool HQ to be mined and returned. Disk space is more or less a solved problem for now, and hopefully block pruning will reduce that in time.
UTXO space ( is the only issue we don't have a good solution to. In short, with bigger blocks, the increase in UTXO size could overtake affordability in memory terms. Possibilities include better handling of UTXO (for example keeping them on disk), and/or miners accepting lower fees/demanding higher fees depending on a transaction's affect on UTXO space requirements.
Lastly, many feel that as blocks space becomes constrained, it will push up fees, which are currently ridiculously low compared to infrastructure cost (block rewards makes this workable). I'm sure it will, but IMHO there's no rush to start putting higher fees on Bitcoin while block rewards are high enough, and fees spiking too early is simply likely to crash usage.
1. If transactions continue to grow (ignoring any scenario in which usage spikes and we have a much bigger problem much faster), eventually we will get to the point where not all transactions get into blocks. This is simply fact - fees assist prioritisation, but we have more transactions than block space, something won't fit in. If that occurs, we now have money that can't necessarily be used, leading to a risk of a digital "bank rush" as everyone sprints to more liquid assets, making things much worse.
2. While scaling technologies (off-chain / side-chain transactions) are coming, the current limit is absurdly low even if Bitcoin is only used for very large settlement transactions between institutions. Concerns that the average person may not be able to rung a full node seem absurd if no-one but banks can afford the fees (presuming we don't get a bank rush and the whole thing implodes)
3. There is no urgency to change the block size now, but the later we leave it, the harder it is. A high proportion of all users must upgrade their software for the change, and this means not just Bitcoin Core,  but any alternative wallet software, potentially re-testing custom setups, etc. The earlier we have a patch for this, the longer we have to get everyone ready for the actual switchover.
@_date: 2015-06-02 12:37:33
It will be briefly tolerable while people have 20-30 minute waits for first confirmation on transactions here and there, but it's not like we can flick a switch the moment it's a bit more of an issue and transactions start to be dropped.
Do you really think people are going to want to start trying to guess how much of a fee they need to apply to their transaction to get their payment to confirm in a useful time frame, vs getting the credit card out?
From my point of view best-case is traffic will slide to Litecoin &amp; Dogecoin (4x and 10x Bitcoin max transactions per second, respectively) - I'm an altcoin dev so perhaps that's not your best-case! Likely case is this will cause such a huge loss of confidence in the technology, as users have no certainty of if/when transactions will complete, that it effectively trashes the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.
@_date: 2015-06-19 12:55:27
I want to also point out there's this straw-man argument that Side B want to increase the block size and do nothing else. IMHO "scale with off-chain and no block size increase" is infeasible, it would leave us with multi-gigabyte blocks, and I don't even want to think the engineering to confirm blocks in a 10 minute window.
What I'm struggling to get across to people is how hopelessly inadequate 1MB blocks are. It's about right for all interbank only transactions in the US only _right now_. Presuming that Bitcoin being global (let alone the main chain remaining something individuals can afford to use) is desirable, we need bigger blocks just to link together off-chain/sidechain systems.
The argument is not "Make blocks bigger, job done, go home", but "Make blocks bigger so they can support the external transaction networks that will handle 99.99% of transactions."
@_date: 2015-06-26 12:36:10

By baked in, you mean it gets more expensive until the demand balances with supply? That still doesn't mean more people get their transactions through... 
@_date: 2015-06-19 14:01:12
I find it amazing that we're arguing over adding scope for usage to increase over 50-100% from where we are, and yet people are seriously talking of a country adopting Bitcoin. If each of Greece's population of 11 million send one transaction per day, that would be an average of 127 transactions per second (vs a current limit of 3-7 transactions per second). Virtually no proposal on the table currently would be enough for Greece to adopt Bitcoin, let alone any that's being seriously considered.
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:16:22
As an altcoin dev for a much, much larger coin (5th-ish by market cap), personally my stance is that Bitcoin's block size not increasing is terrifying. Sure, excess traffic might "overflow" onto us, and that would be great, but I think a lot of people vastly overestimate user's emotional investment in cryptocurrency. Adoption for the entire ecosystem is very slow, and ease of use a major criticism. If users start seeing transactions fail, and are told "Oh you have to guess at a fee high enough to get your transaction through", many will just give up IMHO.
@_date: 2015-06-10 11:44:55
I suspect they would lose market share if they adopted such a model, but there's nothing stopping them doing so. Given they lost $21million back in 2013 (  - I can't find a more recent figure readily), their current model is clearly not working out for them.
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:32:56
I'd be more confident if I saw patches for anything apart from Bitcoin Core, but they're not _that_ hard, so lets skip that.
How much is a high-enough fee? I mean, sure, when the first block is full, it'll just slip to the next. What about when the second block is full. Then the next. And the next. This will turn into an avalanche when it starts, as each transaction that can't fit in one block will increase pressure on the next. Exchanges will send funds to customers and they will simply never arrive, requiring a resend and hope three days later (I _think_ that's the lifespan on mempool, but don't quote me on that). Any hard fork is likely to have a minimum 6 month delay while everyone updates software (not just core, but Electrum, Multibit, Android Wallet, Toshi, and a lot of other software I can't list off the top of my head). In all likelihood people will move back to credit cards that _just work_ and not look back.
@_date: 2015-06-09 07:40:57
We still need to make cryptocurrency easier to use for both businesses and customers. It's a huge leap forward, but this is no silver bullet. 
This massively aides scaling, and provides a route for more complex smart transactions than main chain supports. Faster confirmations are absolutely also an option for sidechains. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 05:25:36
That tells us where we are today. It gives us a timescale for the switch, but we need to look at other transaction networks to see where we're going. 
1MB blocks are just about enough for a bank to bank only network covering the US. We have to increase the limit even just to support transactions between sidechains or offchain networks. The later we leave a decision, the harder this becomes 
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:50:16
Thanks for writing that up, the effort is appreciated. I'll reply in depth over the weekend, one thing I can quickly say is I'd schedule the hard fork further off (I'm thinking June 2016). Much of why I think we need to change now, is to absolutely maximise chances that software is updated before the hard fork occurs, so later is better, but a 12-month delay is probably as late as we can leave it.
@_date: 2015-06-25 08:13:29
Absolutely - but people are arguing that we can't change block size because it's not what Satoshi intended, and in that context I think this is a good counterpoint.

Well I think I know what I'm doing with my weekend 
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:34:56
Scaling, mostly. Trying to jam every single transaction through a single blockchain is incredibly masochistic, there's no need for people in the UK to know every transaction in the US, and vice-versa (for example). Having localised or other sidechains makes a very good way to find the orders of magnitude of scaling that Bitcoin needs to be adopted globally (it also needs the main chain block size increased, this is not intended as an instead-of).
@_date: 2015-06-09 06:55:53
More deployed infrastructure over time. Not just Bitcoin Core nodes, but also all the alternative wallets which must be updated and tested for compatibility. The same argument many make against altcoin adoption, that Bitcoin is already in place, also means it takes vastly longer to do a refresh cycle of the software. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:31:04
Nope, you're going to have to try that one again, slowly.
Litecoin uses Scrypt in place of SHA256 in its proof of work calculations (and changes block time), it still has blocks which are strictly ordered in a chain. Not sure how that wouldn't be a blockchain.
AuxPoW/merged mining means that work performed in calculating Litecoin blocks can be submitted as work on another blockchain, if that work meets specific criteria. You can also natively mine a merged blockchain, but no-one does because it's more cost-effective to mine a non-merged chain and get free merged coins as well, it's really just a contingency mechanism.
The important part is in the blocks on the parent chain (Litecoin) being formed such that they are suitable proof of work for child chain(s) such as Dogecoin. To do this, the coinbase transaction (also known as a generate transaction, the one that gives coins to the miner) includes a merkle tree root of block hashes for all child chains. It also includes a value to identify the parent chain. What this means is that:
* The parent block cannot be mined before the previous block of the child chain.
* The miner intended for the work to used for the child block mined (hence it cannot be used for another block).
* Work performed mining a chain cannot be submitted back to itself.
If you see any gaps in that, do let me know. I've simplified things a little, but I thin that covers the important details.

@_date: 2015-06-25 08:21:18
It would be a better quote if there wasn't a flaw in this theory. The post he's referring to: 
This goes back to why we're arguing over block size. His method only protects against double-spends as long as it's virtually inevitable that a transaction is included in a block. If that's no longer true, then however far a transaction propagates, you have no guarantee it will be in a block until it's mined.
If blocks are consistently full, we will lose transactions. That means some transactions will be seen by the network, and a few days later they have not been mined and instead rollback. You can do whatever you like with fees, but if the network can handle 4,200 transactions per block (7 transactions per second multiplied by typical block time) and there's 4,201 transactions, it pushes that overflow to the next block. If there's no space in the next block, it continues to roll along, until either it's paying better than another transaction and is prioritised (in which case the lower fee transaction risks never being mined) or is rolled back.
@_date: 2015-06-12 19:14:25
Agreed - I may disagree with his conclusions, but it comes down to frankly subtle details (I think Bitcoin isn't ready to hit block size limits and the effect will be extremely negative and difficult to recover from, whereas my understanding is he sees the market handling it much better and the transition smoother), I would absolutely encourage that people listen to him when considering the debate.
@_date: 2015-06-09 08:13:39
Except we need a 6 month lead time to any Bitcoin network change, and ideally that should be closer to 18 months. We need to get 60-70% of all users to upgrade ahead of the change, although 90+% should be the target (we'll never hit 100% simply due to old systems kicking around that no-one maintains). For the average user this may be just a case of upgrading their wallet software, but for the major services (exchanges, payment processors, etc.) they may have their own modifications to the wallet, or entirely custom wallets (i.e. Copay, Toshi) that need to be updated and tested.
I led a hard fork of an altcoin with a three month deployment window and several volunteers working to contact everyone we could find details for, to prompt them to upgrade, and still had two exchanges miss the deadline (despite prompting). One quite spectacularly claimed their sys-admin was on a three month break: 
@_date: 2015-06-09 07:48:03
Note this isn't a full altcoin replacement. Firstly, if issuance scheme is significantly different (i.e. Dogecoin being inflationary), you can't do that on a sidechain. Secondly, someone actually has to write the new sidechains to replace altcoins. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:43:22
None of these are blockers for block size, all of them are vastly harder. If he said we need O(1) block propagation before block size, or block pruning (which is in progress I believe), that might make more sense, but this is like saying we shouldn't deal with a small fire that's starting to spread because we haven't cured cancer yet.

In which I finally make the connection and go "OH! _That_ Rusty"
I've been presuming IBLT is useful for smaller blocks. If it's not, that's a huge problem too, because it means we have the looming block size issue and no answer on how to handle increases usefully. Certainly I don't think 100+MB blocks are a good idea, we should be splitting into other chains long before that point (my stance is that Bitcoin main chain will inevitably become primarily a clearance network between other chains, but that the 1MB limit is insufficient even for just that).
If we can't use larger blocks easily... I suppose essentially we have to be very careful with adoption rate vs network scaling, perhaps even consider slowing intentionally?

Agreed - coverage of Y2k bugs the hell out of me. Having known people auditing and fixing the code, maybe we weren't going to see civilization fall (certainly, I was in my house with no substantial food stocks - I know others who did buy several months of food ahead though), but a LOT of code was fixed, and incredible numbers of systems upgraded or replaced in time for y2k, and I have no doubt we would have seen widespread disruption and failures otherwise.

Or potentially the Bitcoin Core devs adopt bigger blocks and both clients fit again? 
@_date: 2015-06-04 10:31:16
Cool - when will we hit 1 mb blocks at current usage increase rate, and how long after that do non-microtransactions start being pushed out of blocks? 
Edit: Specifically, lets figure out when this will be an issue, and get the patch in _now_ so that everyone who installs Bitcoin Core from here on gets the forked version by default, rather than leaving it continually to later points. I'm fairly certain that's not a linear curve though, and as such we'll see usage spiking faster than many expect.
@_date: 2015-06-04 11:17:21
Generally it was presumed the code would be replaced long before 2000.

The point I'm trying to make is once blocks are consistently full, all guarantees are off. The limit is a hard one - paying a fee high enough to get your transaction into a block (at all) means someone else's doesn't make it.

So don't mine large blocks then. This simply removes a cap on what's valid, miners can still decide not to mine more than 1mb blocks, or only transactions with fees above a certain level 
@_date: 2015-06-08 07:23:20
It's a fixed limit, and there's a minimum transaction size, so really not going to happen without changing the code. 
If you mean the software will be changed to support something new, that's really not baked in is it? 
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:00:00
The actual transactions on the network are just a sequences of bytes (no check characters, no base58 encoding). Much more compact, but no values are invalid per-se. There is no such thing as "invalid" in this context, merely hashes for which no-one has the matching private key.
The addresses people use do have checksum characters and stricter encoding, but those exist as a sanity check for your client, and that redundancy is dropped before a transaction is built. It's certainly possible (I've done it) to screw up transaction building, make a perfectly valid seeming transaction for which you don't have the keys (and this is why we have testnet!)
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:49:40
Essentially agreed, I may be missing something but I don't see any practical way for an open network to be mined without paying miners somehow, and a closed network feels like it's a very expensive way of solving problems that can be handled other ways.
Even if an open network is merge-mined (which would likely give it significant mining power), the miners still have to be encouraged to actually install the software and provide infrastructure. An alternative blockchain could issue its own tokens that are effectively IOUs for another currency, but again we're back to finding a complex solution to a problem you didn't really start with.
Having had a similar conversation with Mike &amp; Gavin, their suggestion was to use the transaction log of a database (as in  - I may have spent a non-trivial amount of time thinking of an entirely different type of transaction and being duly confused), and presumably replicate it to several independent systems so it can be verified over time. I see no significant security gain for a private blockchain, over this model.

I develop for an altcoin that acts as a clear counterpoint to that, *but* I think trying to change the cap this late in Bitcon's life would be doomed to failure (especially as I think we've essentially absorbed the market share for people who want an inflationary coin).

The problem is that even if we presume Lightning networks are available in time, we still need to connect all these networks together. The current limit isn't enough even just as a backbone between networks, if we truly expect cryptocurrency to be global. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 18:46:33
Their infrastructure costs are increased by the length of the blockchain, though, so there's a pressure to keep it shorter. The really major issue is UTXO (unspent transaction output) space, which Gavin talks about in his post: 
So they have to make blocks to get coins, but each transaction included is a balance of both immediate cost (bandwidth, increased risk of orphan block as block size increases) vs mining rewards for that transaction.
@_date: 2015-06-04 14:05:49
Okay, lets consider Bitcoin as a purely settlement system. CHAPS (very fast, typically very high value transactions) in the UK did 37 million transactions in the 12 months to end of April 2015 (  ). That's... just over a transaction per second, on average, although CHAPS is not available 24/7 (I think it's closer to 7/5, but don't quote me on that), and each transaction costs £25 (about $40USD).
That's just for the UK, population 64 million. Presuming scaled usage for the US (population 300 million), between them that traffic would consume the available block size, before we add in the other 95% of the world population.
7 transactions per second is laughably small for a global clearance system, let alone one that we want to remain accessible to average person. The suggested block size increase is not instead, it's to bring the blocks up to be big enough for clearance purposes.
To answer your other question - not directly. We have a higher block rate, but we have more immediate issues in that total market cap and liquidity are constraining more widespread adoption by payment processors. Longer term we're likely to follow Bitcoin's solutions (which is in many ways why it makes more sense for me to encourage Bitcoin to fix stuff, rather than us trying to head off in our own direction).
Edit: Difficult to find good sources or recent data, but in 2010 CHIPS (US interbank only transaction network) was at nearly 3 transactions per second according to

This is generally the point where we conclude that we're now engineering to solve a problem we didn't have when we started.
I like the idea of scan-to-order, but it sounds like it's going to be simpler for that to launch an ordering protocol that ends with Bitcoin, rather than starting with Bitcoin and trying to staple an ordering protocol to it.

20MB block limit does not mean 20MB blocks. I strongly suspect miners will start being pickier about what they mine, and transactions with low fees will find it hard to get into blocks. I wouldn't expect to approach the limit for years, but we need to make plans now so they're easy to roll out and test in time. 
Also, did anything happen with O(1) block propagation?

Appreciate that you're actually doing analysis! A few points:
* Relaying blocks from a home PC is really difficult, but you should be able to use a server in a well connected data centre to handle the block relay, and only the header goes to/from your home.
* I'd hope we'll see [O(1) block propagation]( in time, to help mitigate that requirement
* 8MB block size maximum doesn't in any way mean 8MB blocks, it means the network will accept blocks up to 8MB. You're entirely welcome to cap generated block size at 1MB, for example. Further, we're trying to plan ahead, so there should be a decent "ramp up" time as blocks go from the current 700-ishkb up towards the hard cap.

You have to be comfortable assessing this for yourself; I'm all-in on DOGE myself, but that's because it's the right level of risk, I understand its market dynamics, and I think it will grow on a timescale that's positive for me.
It is, however, very different to Bitcoin, in that the inflationary approach makes it more like a conventional currency. I think this is good; to me Bitcoin has an artificially constrained supply, and I don't think it has the attraction of other scarcity-based assets.
So, I like Dogecoin because it lets me cheaply and easily move money over the Internet without giving someone credentials they can use to charge more money to my account (unlike credit cards). If that sounds good to you too, perhaps you should get some.

Not a clue. The markets stopped behaving rationally a long time ago, as far as I am concerned. When MtGox looks likely to recover, the tip because they're worried about arbitrage.

Invertible bloom lookup tables are certainly an excellent first step, but I think we do need something different to scale long term.

It was a really bad idea.
If you're buying it, you're essentially announcing what you're using it for. If you accept it, once you've got it, then what? Are you going to ever be able to cover costs in Sexcoin? Probably not. So you have to sell it back to someone for actual useful currency, for them to then give it to another merchant/service provider.
The idea of niche currencies is just crazy; a niche may help launch a currency, but any currency has to be usable day to day, at least in the long term, to function. That means food, shelter, energy must all be available with it.

That's a good question; at the moment spotting that blocks aren't appearing on the blockchain is a manual process, so could be a while. Automatically having mining software check that found blocks appear on the blockchain would be a good way of helping mitigate this risk, though.

Ask people why they're not using Bitcoins. In my experience, you'll get a few answers, none of which you'll like.
1. Most people just don't care. Which is terrible, because what we have are expensive services everyone thinks are free because the costs are all business-side. No easy answers there.
2. It's difficult to use. Yes, sure, I'm technically minded, you're technically minded, but... no, really, it's difficult. Payment protocol helps, but we need focus harder on making payments easy. People want a big "0.05BTC due, pay now" button on the website and they press it and it asks for password to confirm and then they're done. This is a priority for me right after everything else I have to do (so probably like January, maybe you want to get someone else to take a look meanwhile).
3. People don't want the responsibility. You may like having the control over your backups and hot wallet / cold store decisions, most people just want to buy stuff and not think about it. Really good web wallets will help here; multisig wallets are a good start, maybe they're enough, maybe their not, not sure.
There seems to be a culture of telling people they're wrong when they don't agree with what cryptocurrency offers, and maybe we have to accept that if it's going to see serious adoption, we're going to have to listen to some unpopular opinions.

Believe in it for what? If all people do is hold Bitcoin because it goes up through artificial restriction of supply, you've re-invented a ponzi scheme. It _has_ to be a useful currency in the long term, and that means closing supply chain loops. Yes, it will take a while, but the we want the merchant to take crypto and pay it to the shipping company, who pay it to the electricity company, who pay it to parts manufacturing... eventually it gets to the point where you can realistically start paying most staff in crypto and we stop cashing out. However we can only take small steps right now.

@_date: 2014-08-01 09:23:01
Small problem; you're presuming the current price reflects current value only, while in reality I believe there's a strong speculative element to the Bitcoin price. That is to say, a substantial part of future price increases are already priced in.
Bitcoin is still a high risk investment, and one which IMHO (this is not investment advice, etc. etc.) has sufficient potential rewards to balance that risk for those who want to go that path, but another three orders of magnitude increase seems optimistic to me.

That, to me, is what decentralised government should be about. Tools to empower the average person to engage with tasks the government currently does. Roads, water, sewage, power, air traffic control, defence, environmental protection, disaster management; all of these things and more need to be done by someone. There is just far too much stuff for people to meaningfully deal with directly, and we need tools to make it possible for people to get involved.

Honestly, I'd inferred they were wanting people to keep money in the exchange so they'd be more likely to trade. I also, perhaps foolishly, didn't pay much attention to the interest announcement because I wasn't keeping BTC there long enough to earn interest (I deposited and essentially lost coins within the same hour). In retrospect it's easy enough to see this in both the interest payments, and the insanely high withdrawal fees, but I don't think it was all that obvious.

The main risk you've got is someone managing to hack upstream traffic of a payment processor. Lets say you're a payment processor, and you see a couple of dozen $100 transactions go through, but all nodes you can reach say they're fine, so on they go.
Suddenly, you get a block with the funds going to another address instead, and you're down $1,200.
Sound unlikely? Sure, but if you can figure out where a merchant's nodes are and hack the routers upstream of them, I see no reason why you can't "blindfold" them like that. I think this is one of the reasons for pushing for Tor usage actually.

400M$ at current BTC prices, probably well past 500M$ by the time you realise the market will move upwards if you try buying that many BTC.


Of which many (if not the vast majority) will be inactive, many will have been active but have moved into more reliable exchanges, and much of the rest wouldn't touch MtGox with a barge pole.
You can build a whole new company and give $10 worth of Bitcoin away to 10 million random people as an introductory offer, and have a better plan than this.

Yes, brute-forcing by simplest search algorithm would take insanely long. You'd use  today, and I'm sure there's a lot of very bright minds are working on better ways of cracking keys.
Here's the NIST recommended key lengths and algorithms, with dates they're expected to be secure for: 
Now, yes, that says 2030 for the tech we're talking about, and that's probably a pessimistic estimate (as in, maybe 2040), but ultimate protocol flaws are virtually inevitable. So if you can wait until 2040, you may yet get your BTC back...

It can of course also tax non-US citizens (especially those in the country, although I've had to fill in a US tax return for trading which occurred in the US despite not being there or a US citizen - fortunately just a "This was exempted under &lt;x&gt;" form), and I believe in extreme cases US citizens can end up paying income taxes even if not living &amp; working in the US!

I see what you mean, and in time I think you're right, but right now Bitcoin's a tiny part of the market still.

He's saying PayPal believes in BTC. That rather doesn't mean much. It may imply things, but I can't think of anything that withstands much serious consideration.
If I announced that I was going to a thousand BTC (I'm not - I don't have even a fraction of that much money, but work with the example), the price would jump. That's only market manipulation if I don't follow through with the original statement.

The first is debatable unless the coin is misrepresented. If it says no premine and it has a premine, that's really bad. If it's honest about it, though, people are getting in knowing the  situation. 
The second and third are basically the same, and they're terrible. Too many voodoo economists who believe everyone can get magically rich, and it's just scaring potential users off. It's classic survivor bias; those who make money stay and are visible, those who lose frequently just back out of crypto altogether.

Stocks, however, give you benefits; you get voting rights with regards to the company, and normally they pay dividends on your investment. Their value typically goes up in proportion (or down) to the profitability of the company.
Bitcoin is only going to increase in value until it's so expensive that it's cheaper to replace the infrastructure. Given that virtually altcoins are based on identical tool suites (AFAIK all wallet daemons can be used via JSON-RPC and take the same sort of commands), the cost to move infrastructure is very low.
@_date: 2014-08-07 10:53:17
Payment protocol also helps hugely with zero-conf transactions by letting the retailer (or their payment processor, such as BitPay) control the relaying. I'm nervous of calling it a solved problem, I would still worry about endpoints being DoSed to isolate them, personally, but this is not "This is totally unworkable", this is "We need good ways of assessing and mitigating risk, and we're well on the way to doing that, but I don't think we can call it job done quite yet".
IPO; if I buy a stock I generally expect to be paid dividends in line with the value of the stock (some modification for future earnings expectation, of course). To me the housing market is a better analogy; people buy houses from those who paid a fraction of the current value, and often are happy to do so because they believe they will be paid vastly more later. Seems crazy to me, but apparently not to everyone else.
Scalability; you do realise most of your suggested solutions involve moving to a rapidly shrinking number of archival/super nodes? Are you comfortable with that, because... well, it's not how I'd tackle this. Certainly, it's an option, and I think mining trends the same way anyway; sites with readily available power, cooling and network connectivity will fundamentally be cheaper than those without, and as the profit margins shrink through competition, centralisation is almost inevitable there.
Things that worry me include that pools trend towards 50+% of total hashrate every few months, then there's a lot of screaming, and they shrink, and then the cycle repeats. This is not at all Bitcoin-specific, nor do I believe its something that cannot be solved (probably be more effectively mitigating 51% attacks, but others have looked at modifying mining itself), but I don't think it's a solved problem yet.
The use of hash digests of public keys to generate addresses also worries me; I'm cautious we're effectively throwing away entropy and accelerating the rate at which someone will find a way of breaking SHA256 sufficiently to build EC keys they hold the private key for, and match existing payment addresses. Not a short-term risk by any means (we're talking decades), but if you want me "Hmmm...." list, it's on it. P2SH addresses make me nervous for much the same reason.

Even if you can write secure software, you also have all sorts of other attack vectors. Vircurex's problems started when their VPS provider reset their panel password and sent it to someone else, and it turned out both the IP restrictions and 2FA on their VPS provider's panel was broken (source:  )
Their next issue was one of a double-spend attack on Feathercoin (I can't find much more detail than just a reference to this in the August report, perhaps others can?)

This is one of the reasons we need alternative clients. I've been working on [Toshi]( support for an altcoin because having an alternative full non-reference node implementation that people can use is a huge leap forward.

I mean it's not hugely difficult for a merchant that takes Bitcoin to also take Litecoin, Dogecoin, or whatever other coin comes along.

The 10 minute block times for Bitcoin are... a thing... too. Bad isn't the right term; if I'm ordering a book from Amazon, waiting 30 minutes to an hour for payment to be confirmed is no biggie (although it does need to be a little more fire and forget). If I'm buying something in a shop, it's less good. Payment protocol helps with zero-confirmation transactions, nor are faster confirmation times without their risks (confirmation time affects security relative to wall clock time, not block count), but... well it's still a stumbling block.
Honestly, I also think at some point a lot of people are going to question (again) why they should pay Bitcoin early adopters orders of magnitude more than their original investment for the coins, and that's going to be disruptive (although I've been very wrong on that before, so maybe I underestimate people's willingness to believe something will increase in value indefinitely). We're not at IPv4, we're at Econet. The technology is rough and having others doing different things (however subtly) in the same space isn't inherently bad.
Scalability isn't talked about enough, either. Bitcoin has... maybe a million users? Hell, lets say 10 million. You want to target billions, and you want them using it day in, day out. What's that going to do to the blockchain? It's going to balloon unless a better way of handling it is found. Altcoins actually help here by effectively horizontally scaling; alternatively you could look at having geographically-orientated blockchains given most transactions will be localised, so there's a UK blockchain and a France blockchain and value generally moves within a single blockchain, only hopping between as needed in a simulated PoB or something.
TLDR; there's a lot of unanswered questions, and I think presuming any current coin has it all nailed down is over-optimistic.

I would argue liberals see government not as a good thing to be supported, but as the least bad option of those available. I'm all for better options, but so far everything I've seen suggests that decentralisation cannot work without a supporting framework that we don't have yet.

As this is an ideal opportunity for ensuring new devs coming to cryptocurrencies are aware of them, could you link through to any documentation on best practices?
@_date: 2014-02-04 12:33:32
To expand on that; most merchants just won't hold cryptocurrencies until they stabilise. No-one wants to be the guy who's holding all their value in BTC when the price halves, and their suppliers are asking for payment in fiat.
Edit: Also, you really don't want to the poor bastard that has to take out a business loan in BTC...

I agree, but even then you can get caught out. Sent money to exchange through, had a withdrawal fail less than 30 minutes after I deposited coins (it's listed in my account but has no transaction ID and never arrived) and 4 days later it turns out they're effectively seizing that money.

However, that considers Bitcoin as a way of transferring value between individuals (competing with banks), rather than a payment system (competing with credit cards). Nothing wrong with that at all, but in that case alts could fill in the gap for lower-value payments.

No, because while people panic that they can _see_ 51% of the mining power, what's actually a problem is any entity controlling that much mining equipment.

Turned out, first withdrawal didn't send; the money's not in my account, but it never arrived and there's no TxID listed. In fact, emailed on Friday to ask them to cancel the withdrawal so I could just withdraw via DOGE.
I have a feeling there's enough newbies out there I'll get my money back in time, but honestly cannot recommend trading with a company that uses customer funds to patch holes in its own budget. If they were offering shares or bonds, it would be one thing, but "We're seizing your money and going to let you have it back if we make a profit" is insane.

Oh, good grief, where to start.
It doesn't just apply to companies in NY, it applies to any legal entity undertaking cryptocurrency interactions with anyone in NY as well. To quote:
"Virtual Currency Business Activity means the conduct of any one of the following types of activities involving New York or a New York Resident: (1) receiving Virtual Currency for transmission or transmitting the same"
That means you have to submit fingerprints, maintain an undefined balance, cannot invest in cryptocurrencies... you get the picture. Now, maybe I'm reading that too literally, but that's what they've written, and it's insane. I'm not even sure I can legally comply with this, because the data requirements for this law very likely conflict with the data protection laws of the country I'm resident in.
Yes, there's a need for effective regulation. Effective regulation does not involve a random bag of rules to jump through with no clearly defined payoff for the costs incurred. Come to me with clear "Here's what went wrong in MtGox, here's what regulation can do to help, here's rules which solve this specific issue" and I'm happy to engage with the process, but that's not what we're seeing here.

While it's 150k/month, it's also important to consider where these devs work, does the Foundation rent office space? More expense. Travel costs for devs to events? More expense. Several other staff have been mentioned above.

sadshibe28? Yeah, fairly obviously. Tom_Hanks13, though, looks to be active on the account and I'm not going to start exhaustively hunting through their posts. Also maybe they just did have an alt they used, I'm actually more curious to see if it's the rate of mining (which I agree is problematic, but the one attempt to change caused a raging inferno across the subreddit) or the uncapped number (which... well, it's what I see as the biggest economic difference vs Bitcoin, and certainly is a major part of what attracts me to the coin).
@_date: 2014-08-19 14:44:13


We've talked about it within the coin I dev for. We'd probably keep single-sig keys for lead dev and someone else, but we need more people who can send alerts, while also needing some way to mitigate the risk they'll do something daft. Specific examples of concern include cases such as a massive netsplit (I blame sharks  ) and needing to alert everyone on each side of the netsplit to reduce activity so the inevitable fork resolution is limited. Functionally, having trusted devs on each continent is infeasible, let alone ensuring there's constantly someone awake and ready to act incase of a split, so we need to have more than one and do it by averages.

The problem is spotting when it hits an exchange, unless either the exchange uses a particular pattern for addresses (which I'd recommend against because it means you're screwing with the address randomness) or for some reason publishes its addresses.

Considered old? About 6 months. People have no attention span :(
Anyone buying alts because they want something that's like Bitcoin but new, is unlikely to have a good experience. I'm involved with an alt because the deflation/inflation thing is a major issue for me, but it's confusing when people want to try changing alts to be more Bitcoin-like. If you want to invest in Bitcoin, just... y'know, invest in Bitcoin.

I'm going to be blunt here; if the Bitcoin community starts bailing out incompetently run companies, to the loss of much better run companies, I'm going to lose a lot of faith in you guys.


It's listed as having 127,000 creditors (  ). It seems reasonable to assume most of them will give up on Bitcoin, or move onto other exchanges, or possibly even be bankrupt as a result. Of the non-creditor users, very few are likely to return.
@_date: 2014-08-18 13:28:10
You can _use_ Bitcoin though, and the ability to use it is increasing rapidly. I mean, seriously, there's altcoins out there that are fairly much doing nothing except bouncing between traders on exchanges right now. They just exist in a weird state of being potentially usable later. The big alts are fighting tooth and nail for merchant adoption (do you have any idea how awkward it is when I have to sell my own coin for BTC to pay for services?), but the smaller ones are all just hypothetical future usability.
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:01:27

They've mostly gone away, but there was a lot of posts around its initial shutdown, where people were saying it should be supported as being first, for its support of the community, etc. etc.
There's a decent point about realising the exchange is a victim of crime, but most of its problems are self-inflicted, typically through lack of skills to manage their affairs and reluctance to hire in skilled staff (or inability to keep). Even if they weren't cracked, they were still a badly run exchange.

Is that the address Dogetipbot gives you when you're sent a tip? It'll be the address for depositing Doge if you want to tip others; to withdraw you need a wallet, which generates its own address, which you then give to Dogetipbot to send to. As said, they're inexpensive, which is why they're an easy tipping currency (because I can drop 50 Doge on someone without even having to think about it).
Localbitcoins is probably your best bet. Ultimately, Bitcoin is closer to being a currency than an asset, and therefore the infrastructure focuses on moving money between bank accounts, not paying for them with credit cards, sorry.
Edit: I'd suggest going to and familiarising yourself with how the basics work, using those Doge, because even if you accidentally sent them to someone else, or lose the wallet, at least you're not losing a lot. Then try bigger amounts of BTC/LTC/DOGE/whatever.

Not even that; it's great for people in the bits of the US who get Google fiber.
The common answer is in fact that the blockchain will move towards a small number of archival/mining nodes that hold everything, and virtually everything else is an SPV node. I've personally wondered if having multiple parallel blockchains grouped around network timings would be workable, in the presumption that spending tends to be loosely correlated by location, and location loosely correlates to network delay. This means transactions across blockchains end up as a burn/issue pair then actually spending at destination, but within a single blockchain it works more as normal.

If people are attacking Bitcoin on feel free to point me at them.
For those unaware, we're in the final stages of moving client base from Litecoin to Bitcoin (so we're Bitcoin-with-Scrypt based, now, rather than a simple Litecoin fork). The 1.7 client (which is effectively your 0.9 client) is probably stable enough to release, but we're holding on to it for a bit more testing first.
Once we have that under control (don't hold your breath, we're a small team and we're doing the first few years of Bitcoin history on fast forward right now), I know at least myself and another of the Dogecoin devs are planning on hopping over and seeing what we can do directly on the Bitcoin client, because that's by far the most efficient use of resources. We're always going to be coins with different fundamentals, and I would hope it's clear we're not competing directly.

There's a lot more to coin testing than testnet. For example, the coin I work on just released a major update, and we're getting reports of crashes but only on Vista 32bit. That's not something that's easily spotted without having huge numbers of machines on-hand to test against.
There's also "exposure to the real world" issues, where the dataset on a production network is much more varied than the relatively controlled environment of testnet.

More constructively; you have to look at the huge amounts of money these companies are making already. There's no motivation for them to take on a high-risk technology they don't really understand, and which doesn't integrate well with their existing processes. In particular, Bitcoin has to function as a currency to succeed, and currencies are (generally) not something you invest in, and I don't see them wanting to push the envelope on that either.
Lastly, if they really really wanted in, they'd probably just build a dedicated mining facility in Iceland (where electricity is cheap) and mine like crazy instead.
@_date: 2014-09-02 10:03:22


Exactly, it will go for the one with most mining power. If you get a serious conflict on a hard fork, you can get a permanent unreconcilable fork, where both forks become valid. The value of those Bitcoins is then split between the two forks, and most likely in time exchanges start trading between "Bitcoin Classic" and "Bitcoin Plus" (or whatever).
I'm currently coordinating a hard fork on an altcoin with a quarter the nodes of Bitcoin; it took 4 months of negotiation to come to an agreement, and with 9-ish days to go we've just about managed to get half the network updated. There's good reasons the Bitcoin devs avoid forking.

Mostly it's a pain to learn a new library when you're likely to have JSON libraries already in place.
For the Dogecoin implementation (and we have to make some tweaks anyway, to ensure you can't accidentally mix up Bit &amp; Doge payments and risk untold chaos) I looked at making it JSON, although in the end decided we were better off sticking closely to the BIP0070 spec wherever practical. JSON serialisation is going to be bigger, but for a hundred bytes here and there it seems odd to have introduced a new containing format.

I think people often surround themselves with similar people. So anti-government/pro-drugs people spend time around similar, and believe everyone is the same.

I'm virtually sure they're expending quite a lot of effort toward tracking any major crime-related movement of coins through the blockchain, although perhaps not in a law-enforcement or recovery context. I also imagine they're not having a lot of success.

Absolutely; which roads get built? Who pays for those roads? Are roads paid for by the people using them, or the people who are near them? Some combination of both? Who co-ordinates fund collections? Who handles the call for bids, collates bids and compares them? If there's problems with the work done, who takes responsibility for ensuring it's put right?

So, they set up a Bitcoin faucet. When someone goes to the faucet, behind the scenes they start a reddit registration process, and get the Captcha from it. The faucet then presents the Captcha to someone, who solves it, and is given a small number of Satoshis for their time. The faucet then passes the solution back to the reddit registration process, which lets the process complete.

You know how we get twitchy when people come to to talk about other coins, and we're all "Wait, how is this Dogecoin stuff?" It's a bit like that. In fact, at the moment is probably more tolerant of Dogecoin than is of most coins (although to be fair, we get trolled hard a LOT).
Some Dogecoin stuff is big enough to be of general interest to people in other cryptos generally, for example the NASCAR sponsorship hitting TV in a big way, but most not.
Generally is a good fit if you want to talk Dogecoin in a more generalised subreddit.

Also the economy's been massively overstretched by the just crazy number of altcoins (I say this as an altcoin dev). Eventually people realised not everyone's going to become magically rich by buying things no-one wants cheaply and selling them to another cycle of people who think they can sell them on later. There HAS to be real use-cases underlying a coin for it to be sustainable.
We also need to stop infighting so much. We expend huge amounts of resources that would be better suited to making things work.
B2B services need to be the next target. Merchants need to be able to pay their costs in cryptocurrencies, or they'll always cash out after each sale for stability. Utility companies, shipping, packaging, manufacturing, lets get these people on board. Lets work on streamlining corporate account management, make it a no-brainer to use crypto instead of cheques or bank transfers.

As a Dogecoin dev, as far as I can tell if these regulations go into force as-is, we would have to at least make all reasonable attempts to stop NY residents from using the coin. I'm not the lead dev, and they may have a different opinion (so this isn't a formal decision), but I am otherwise absolutely serious about this.
The requirements imposed on the developers by this legislation would exceed our available resources at this time, and we would either have to stop usage of the coin in NY (or attempt to do so sufficiently to cover us legally), or cease development.
Edit: Or gather vastly more resources, obviously that's an option.

Good news; if a serious vulnerability is found in the Bitcoin source, it'll probably take out damn near every altcoin too.
Honestly, brand recognition isn't the huge thing going for Bitcoin, it's technical skill. Cryptocurrencies are an advanced research topic, not something you learn in a week or two. Bitcoin's devs have years at this and are still learning and advancing the knowledge domain. How many altcoins have any serious technical skill backing them?
I see, for example, so many calls for X11 adoption, yet so very few read the SHA-3 candidate analysis and find out several of the X11 algorithms were rejected due to security concerns. Darkcoin I think understood what they were doing, and I'm not saying it's not an unmanageable risk, but I see so many blindly following without that depth of analysis.
Edit: Full disclosure, I'm an altcoin dev. I'm just an altcoin dev that sees trying to ignore Bitcoin as madness, that we should be supporting Bitcoin and strengthening cryptocurrency as a concept in doing so.

One thing that puzzles me; how would getting rid of ASICs help? Surely we have a problem that large pools are profitable and can therefore continue to buy more hardware, irrespective of what that hardware is? If it wasn't ASICs it would be GPUs. If it wasn't GPUs it would be CPUs.
My general comment here applies though; we need a push to make p2pool the obvious choice for everyone who's starting to mine with any significant hardware (I'm aware p2pool has scalability issues for low-power miners, but anyone running good ASICs should be starting on p2pool).

All crypto so far has been broken in time, it's just a matter of changing the protocol once cracks start showing. 
For example SHA1 replaced MD5 when MD5 was broken, and was itself later replaced. Public key encryption is significantly more resistant, but in time inevitably keys of current lengths will be broken, and we will move on.

I did wonder that myself.
However; my advice is that if you find yourself at serious disagreement with not only the democratically elected government of the country you're living in, but also the majority of people (and I think you'll find that applies), emigrating to a more suitable country is generally the recommended option. I think (although this is from brief research) the UAE has no effective income tax, for example.
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:39:28
Equally, sorry, my comments shouldn't be taken as offence, more concern for how much you may be over-invested. A lot of people have had very bad experiences buying more Bitcoin than they should, given it's risk profile, and it worries me.
This may actually be what the dip is about; people who had more than they should, unwinding positions as the price recovers. Just a theory, though.

This is more an idea I'm pondering on how you address scaling the blockchain. So the specific issue I'm trying to resolve is that having a huge linear sequence of transactions is going to become progressively harder to scale.
The theory is that transactions tend to be localised; I'm much more likely to exchange money with people and companies in the same city, than I am in different ones. Equally I'm more likely to make payments in the same country. So lets say you have a blockchain per city, suddenly your scaling challenges are simpler.
However, having chains conflict with each other for hashrate is really unhealthy, so you want either sidechains or AuxPoW. Haven't thought much about which is better. Point is, you have a "master" chain that's actually mined, and a lot of other chains which borrow work from it.
Next problem, I visit another city, or buy something online, and out of scope of this chain. So you need some way of moving funds up to the master chain, and across to the new localised chain. Proof of burn might work, but still working on theories for that. Knowing about the right chain to go to is also an issue.
Lastly, the "nearby" question; I'm envisioning using network locality modelled by latency between nodes to determine how close a node is, for this purpose. So while I say a blockchain per city, I really mean a blockchain for 100k-1mil nodes with an interconnect latency below, say, 25ms.
That make any sense? It's all a bit stream of consciousness right now I'm aware

I can understand it from other Scrypt coins, as we are essentially competing for mining resources at least, but Bitcoin and Dogecoin are trying to be quite different things. You're very libertarian, we're a bit more walled garden. You're deflationary, we're inflationary. Fundamentally they're different niches IMHO.

Selling 10 coins worth of stuff at $2k won't even nudge the market. There are, to date, 12,606,100 Bitcoins. Your entire holding represents about 8% of the market. Also, when you try selling your coins, the market will react and start dropping fast.
Actual pump &amp; dumps work on a similar basis, but use hype from news to overinflate the market then allow the scammer to dump their coins before the market realises it's been had. You've re-invented artificial monopoly, and not even very well.

Well, it may well be a copy of a wallet, so he'll have his own copy which he can use to move the money.
As to decrypting it; basically no. It's encrypted specifically to stop anyone without the key accessing it, it'd be really bad if there was a way around it.
@_date: 2014-02-24 10:12:41
To be blunt; the client is complex and intertwined, and the risk of entirely safe-seeming changes having serious consequences is significant. So, yes, it's slow.
We need to have more competition in Bitcoin clients, lets shake out cases where the protocol docs aren't clear, or where there's brittle parts which may break.
@_date: 2014-08-18 13:12:56


A small holding, sure. Cryptocurrencies... okay, actually the current crash kind of wrecked this, but were about 1% of my net value before the crash (and yes, I had to buy into my own coin). They're high risk, with potentially very high rewards. Just getting merchants to keep some profits in crypto would be a huge leap forward. The price can and will stabilise, but it needs to not be insanely risky to not exchange out.
@_date: 2014-12-31 11:43:56
I think a lot of people are burnt once or twice before dropping out, and we're more seeing market churn. However, that drop-out is a serious problem, because we're seeing a lot of people come in, be interested in cryptocurrency, get burnt by the latest scam and then leave, and they're going to be really hard to get back.
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:52:07
Sorry, first answer was perhaps less well considered than it should have been...
Okay, so, I overestimated people's willingness to do stuff for the bigger picture rather than personal gain. Still, we've got... 100k users, 150k? There's 7 billion people on the planet. Lets say Bit &amp; Lite get the bulk, because you guys have your thing and we ours tends to be smaller transactions, and we only get 1 billion.
That's still plenty of scope for value increase through adoption. The 5% inflation everyone likes to talk about? It's 5% only in the first year, because it's fixed as a quantity not as a percentage. Drops to 2% in about 30 years. In time it will drop below the rate at which the human population increases (barring mass extinction or similar). Not sure how I feel about that, but it will anyway.
So, I'm never going to buy a yacht from money I make through crypto, but is that so terrible?
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:54:59
Possible, sort of. Changes are agreed through adoption of a changed client, so you would have to persuade virtually all Bitcoin users to change to a client which required an unsecured transaction to be part of a certain block, for that block to be accepted, essentially hard forking the block chain. 
Basically, no.

The actual cryptography parts are, mostly, isolated into library calls. Sure, no-one's should be changing the proof of work algorithm or modifying wallet encryption without the relevant skills, but there's plenty else that needs improvement in implementation. I believe, for example, that the threading model is heavy on semaphores, so it's reduced to one effective thread much of the time...

I'd actually be more in favour of a fund to help the worst hit of the MtGox coin holders, than trying to rescue the exchange itself. There are complications with such a plan, in terms of verifying users are actually individual people, how to hand out funds (it seems unlikely that 850k BTC could actually be raised), and how to handle cases where people traded GoxBTC for RealBTC, but at least it's helping the right people IMHO.
@_date: 2014-07-18 10:47:19
However, that doesn't solve this for the company. Even as a non-US resident coin developer, with the regulations as-is we would have to make "Not for use by NY residents or in the state of NY" a license condition on the coin, because as written they would hit us otherwise.
@_date: 2015-05-08 15:15:34
I should rapidly add, I don't agree with these people. Alan Reiner's recent message is an excellent commentary on the scaling issues:
"If even 5% of the world (350M people) was using the network for 1 tx per month [...] we'll be above 100 tps"
From 
I've been saying 20mb is enough for an interchange network (i.e. primarily used to get between other chains), but as Alan points out, realistically 20mb is a stop-gap. If nothing better replaces Bitcoin, we should be thinking about 200mb blocks in the extreme long term (2040+)
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:02:02
Nothing happens. Virtually all Scrypt coins could be well over 50%'d by Lite mining pools, and most by Doge pools. No mining pool is going to deliberately do a 51% attack because it's an expensive, risky attack that sabotages a good income stream for them.
A more realistic concern is if a mining pool is hacked and the hacker manages to misuse the pool to execute a 51% attack before anyone notices.

Where can you even trade Auroracoin, though?
@_date: 2015-05-22 12:04:08
This comes down to the different trading styles (there's a LOT of material on this at  ). They go from (from longest to shortest):
* Position trading (long term)
* Swing trading (holding a position for a few days to a few weeks)
* Day trading (holding a position typically for a few hours)
* Scalping (holding a position for anything from an hour down to seconds)
Each of these has similar but different strategies, and in theory provides liquidity to the group "above". That's somewhat dubious with scalpers (who generally are just trying to cream a little off the top of a trade), but day traders help ensure swing/position traders can make trades they want certainly.
Whether the market _needs_ this is debatable, but there will always be demand for exchanges that can handle these styles, and in time likely faster (high frequency trading, which can go down to single millisecond levels). Although it can help if people avoid very fast exchanges, to deter scalpers/HFQ shops. See [IEX]( as a conventional exchange example that is designed specifically to be hostile to high frequency trading.

Wouldn't there be fairly serious concerns outstanding about the quality of their software, in light of the persistent issues with transaction malleability, and if the reports of lost amounts are true (they do seem credible for the number of Bitcoins MtGox could be holding) surely it's cheaper to redo from start than taking on that level of debt?

Bitcoin's probably a technology ahead of its time - without Satoshi I suspect we'd have seen it emerge this decade, but in potentially another form, and potentially with a number of iterations before it "worked.

I bought a bunch the day before MtGox stopped doing withdrawals. Lets just say I'm not doing so well.
However, there's a lot more to this than the black and white good/bad investment stuff being thrown around. There's plenty of points in Bitcoin's history where you could have seen it as a terrible investment, and plenty when people wish they'd bought earlier. If you're happy to trade along, you can make really good money I'm sure.
What I find really interesting, though, is Bitcoin is really only going to make you rich if you have significant spare money to put in to start with, and can ride out the bumps (i.e. don't depend on that money to live on). That's not bad any more than you could argue the weather is bad (it may be unpleasant, but it just is), so much as I think a lot of people have been mis-sold the idea that everyone gets magically rich from cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2014-05-21 21:20:17
While less certain about the government issue, certainly trying to change PoW (or even more drastically to PoS) just delays or transforms the problem of centralised mining power. We need p2pools to be the standard. Mining tutorials should start there, maybe we need video tutorials, not sure how to get everyone over, but they're the only long term solution I can see.

Java exploits are almost universally in the security manager within the VM, and only realistically apply to applets. Meaning unless you're running untrusted code in a sandbox, they don't apply. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 01:16:27
As I understand it (and certainly coming in from the UK, I can't see Bitcoin as a payment option) this is limited to paying USD amounts only for now. Which is a little bizarre, but hopefully we'll see wider support in time.
@_date: 2014-09-18 12:12:54
Something I think we're forgetting is how much Bitcoin has gone through to make it this far. My expectation is we'll see more drops before it picks back up again, as we move towards more merchants, and then the merchants start holding because they can actually use Bitcoin.
My biggest annoyance is with those who told people just holding Bitcoin would make them magically rich overnight; making money is never easy. There's a lot of work to be done, and if we all actually get involved we can push through this.
@_date: 2014-04-18 14:16:10
Hope more BTC turns up in the liquidation process, beyond that, look at what to do next?
No-one in their right mind is going to throw 600,000 BTC into the Bitcoin community, which is what paying off the losses amounts to. The company itself has negligible value beyond its assets...

There's no inevitability to it. If miners can always find better paying transactions to prioritise, and blocks are full, why would they put a lower-fee transaction in, in place of a higher-fee one?
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:15:13
I'd look to credit card history for examples. I remember there being a lot more card companies at once, going back a fair chunk of time I'll admit. We've slowly whittled that down to Visa &amp; Mastercard for 90% of everything, American Express has its own niche, and a few randoms who no-one actually uses.
So, in time, we'll probably trend towards 2-3 coins locked in competition for features, however there's likely to be a lot of change before then. Across an epic timescale one true coin may arise, but I think we're talking an "Etherum 3.0" kind of timescale, not the next year or two!
I should add that I do think most altcoins will implode, where they haven't already, over the next month or so. The dropping BTC price is essentially crashing everything, and most of them are actually or virtually worthless as a result

@_date: 2015-05-08 16:00:30
I'm happy to accept in an ideal world we could run it on any hardware, I see no evidence that's long term feasible.
In terms of fees, yes before we actually lose transactions there will be a period of increased fees to prioritise transactions, and the new fee code in 0.10 makes that a lot neater at least. However eventually we will simply lose transactions, which breaks absolutely everything that accepts zero-conf transactions, as there's no way of knowing the funds will ever arrive, and suddenly we snap into _minimum_ 1 confirmation, which will average more than 10 minutes because of contention. IMHO "Don't know when it will arrive, or if it will arrive" is fairly terrible for any payment system.
In terms of doing a faster hardfork, that's a disaster IMHO. Hard-forking a major altcoin took a team of 3 of us 3 months to co-ordinate, and even then we had two exchanges miss the deadline (despite repeated prompting). One of those continued along the old fork for months, resulting in large scale loss of coins (  ). Bitcoin, with at least 2-3 times the nodes, is going to be vastly harder. A year is probably an optimistic minimum for a hardfork. 2-3 years would be better.

Aware of the problem we have with spam. We're trying to collect people trying to do Dogecoin PR into one place so we can get them a bit more focused rather than just scattershot.

For active traders, ~1 second is a good target, ideally &lt; 100ms. However, for the average Jo that just wants to buy/sell, the couple of hours you can expect it to take for all the confirmations to be done on an atomic cross-chain transaction isn't an issue (there's no need for the human to be present once the trade's agreed, the rest is automated).

Off chain transactions, side chains, etc. are all good improvements, but fundamentally 7 transactions/second is an absurd limit. 20mb blocks gives us ~140 transactions/second - a lot better, but still at least an order of magnitude below what would be required for a global transaction network.

Except it looks like you'll be paying $10/month in electricity for that $1 of Bitcoin mined. The best hardware I can see on  for hash/J is the Antminer S5 at 1.115TH/s for 590W. You'll need about 50GH/s to make $1month after the 75% mining fee.
50/1115 * 590 = 26W * 24 * 365 / 12 = 14kWh/month
I pay ~ 0.12p/kWh, which at current GBPUSD exchange rates is about $12.
@_date: 2015-05-22 12:06:00
Oh, sorry, hadn't realised you meant leveraged and decentralised. That's... I think theoretically possible, but you'd likely need specialised sidechains that understand the concept of "I am making a transaction I cannot fulfill, to be reversed by a later transaction, and will only pay the difference guaranteed by funds in &lt;address&gt;".
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:38:43
For everyone else, that's 
It's a good point, and one Dogecoin is seeing already - our UTXO is a mess, frankly (the Dogeparty burn sent to an address instead of using OP_RETURN, so it's not automatically considered unspent - we'll probably at some point drop transactions to that address from the in-memory UTXO, but there's other cases that are less easy to unpick). Our discussion has included the possibility that input and output data on transactions need to be billed differently, as in the case where a transaction burns more UTXO than it creates, it's actually improving matters.
Also, that doesn't disprove that we need bigger blocks, it just means we now have a rock and a hard place.

On that note, for everyone using altcoins, you should be checking signatures on the wallets. If the wallets don't have signatures, that's not good. Ideally, they should have Gitian signatures so multiple independent devs confirm they're happy with the binaries (Bit, Lite, Doge and Vert do this, and I've been told of a couple of others and then entirely forgot them...), but even just having the sole dev (which is the state of many alts) signing the package at least helps confirm it's not been modified.

I'm not entirely convinced that's true, I believe some people are of the opinion 1 MB is fine and main chain transactions should be expensive, essentially for very high value transactions only, typically between banks and other large institutions, while virtually all conventional transactions occur on alternatives (off chain, side chain, whatever).
@_date: 2015-05-10 10:16:59
The last hard fork (2013) involved a client that had started to be deployed already, and a much, much smaller number of nodes, as well as a lot less code to update.
Much of why we're arguing for a decision now (or ideally about 6 months ago) is because it gets harder to fork as time goes on. A year lead-time now might be 2 years if we wait another year to do it.
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:46:04
I think that's slightly harsh both on the scammed and on many genuine devs.
On the side of the scammed, a lot of people are naive. As in, they do not have sufficient experience to really understand what the risks are. It's easy to say it's their fault, but honestly, I think the lack of general financial education going on is alarming. You can also see this in the common line about Bitcoin and nothing backing it, that so many people still think we're on a gold standard.
On the side of the devs, some do really mean well and things go wrong. MaidSafe would be my go-to example here; innovative technology, quite different to Bitcoin, and a terrible IPO.
Actually, as much as I'm being nice, I do sometimes want to yell "Why are you buying that!?" at people jumping into every new coin.

PHP historically has had a lot of security issues in the actual language design (for example automatically taking any input from the user and blindly assigning it to variable). It's also more fault tolerant than other languages, which is great until that tolerance means a mistake is missed in testing. 
I'd look for a language which is strongly typed (I'd particularly want to know the details of any numeric type I was working with). Java/C# would seem likely choices here.

You need to have enough bandwidth for the relay network, and latency in theory affects orphan rate (although it seems like the peers your connected to are probably a bigger factor than your own network). With a 1MB block limit, we're talking 100KB/minute. Even with the suggested 20MB block limit, it would be 2MB/minute, which is still virtually nothing in cabled bandwidth terms.

Why is it desirable for the average user to run a node at home?
There's a lack of really good SPV clients, yes, but I don't understand this desire to make full nodes the common case. Further, I think blockchain pruning will get you most of the way. I also don't understand how it's more acceptable for transactions to *never confirm* (as will be the case once the network passes 1mb/10 min sustained) compared to requiring mid-high level hardware to run a full node.

Long term I suspect main Bitcoin transactions will become expensive, but for now, yes. This said, it's likely easier to experiment with your own blockchain and work out the details  before trying to adapt to the Bitcoin one. 
I expect we'll see a hybrid model of a small number of backbone chains, with large numbers of dedicated sidechains handling the bulk of traffic, but more localised / specialised.

Something I'm thinking about and I'll write up tonight in detail is that we probably need better tools for miners to decide what to include in blocks, based on cost/reward. A 20mb block size limit by no means requires miners use all of it.

The "For/against" split there gives the wrong impression - the "For" is only those who agree with 20mb as a target size (and the page does note this). Whether we need an increase is IMHO less controversial than the details of what the increase is, when it occurs, and whether any other hard-fork features get through at the same time.
Personally I think Bitcoin needs bigger blocks, but I think the timeline for the switch is too early. Having blocks get to the point where they're mostly full, and then grow at around the rate of traffic increase until 20mb would be my ideal scenario, although there's a lot to be said for keeping it simple.

I did know well enough not to have too much coin in an exchange at one time, to have split my risks, and to try (and fail) to withdraw within an hour of depositing.

Mining rewards are fixed per block, as is block rate, meaning the creation rate is essentially fixed. Except it isn't even just that bad, they decrease over time (next halving in mid 2016). Every chip they sell decreases profit for every other miner, as does every performance increase.

A multipool would be the other thought, but everything so far is Bitcoin-focused so... I don't know.

If you're holding a database of balances with no transaction history, sure. If you've got transaction history, it's tedious but not actually difficult to reconcile with offline copies of records.
I.e. if someone's account says they spent x million USD to buy a lot of BTC, and your deposits to the account don't match up, you've clearly got a problem. For crypto it's even easier, you reconcile the blockchain against the deposits and if the numbers don't match, you have a problem.
However, yes, this requires having isolated copies of your records, and a proper checking process, and given it's very difficult for any external party (users) to know if an organisation has these or just claims to have these, or even has implemented them correctly, AND doing it correctly means a delay launching the service, those that gamble that it'll be okay tend to launch and get users before those that don't.
@_date: 2015-05-31 23:29:56
Consistently full blocks kills zero-confirmation transactions. I can argue I think people will drift away from Bitcoin if they find transaction time highly inconsistent, but that's an opinion. Zero-confirmation is not.
You're out getting breakfast, and go to your favourite cryptocurrency-accepting coffee shop. You pay with Bitcoin, and they accept a zero-conf transaction from you. You leave.
Behind the scenes, your fee paid isn't enough to get your transaction prioritised into a block. It's now essentially a lottery, and if there's consistently enough better paying transactions, the transaction never confirms. Eventually (from memory I think three days, but don't quote me on that) the network gives up on the transaction and it rolls back - you now have your money, the coffee shop does not. That's a DISASTER for Bitcoin, as everyone scrambles to move to confirmed transactions, and we lose all transactions under 10 minutes. Except we've got block contention, so first confirmation can be 20, 30 minutes or more. Or just never.
That's what full blocks gives you. Hand-waving about "We'll figure something else out" isn't a solution. If you have working tech now, put it forward. Don't tell me how someone else will solve your desire not to change, tell me how you're going to fix this, or support someone who is trying to fix it.

Secure today is not necessarily secure tomorrow (  ), even presuming you implement your encryption correctly (many don't) and generate your keys correctly (many don't).

Well... in theory there's no good reason we can't have a BTC side-chain that's used for exchanges. Was actually wondering if you could make a USD side-chain (in theory it works, in practice no-one would mine it, plus huge trust issues).
However, I can't see how the exchange can both move funds, and not be able to move funds if it's cracked.
Honestly, everything I've seen so far says you have to presume your live systems will be cracked. Keys should be generated offline in a secure environment, addresses transferred via thumbdrive or similar to the live environment, and handed out for deposits, so received funds go direct to cold storage. The live system then monitors those addresses. When payments are made out, they're done from a very limited hot wallet, which is topped up from cold storage as needed.
Loss of the hot wallet at worst loses a day's worth of outgoing funds (which is all that should ever be in there).

I think GB blocks are far enough out into the future that we can expect something else to come in instead. We shouldn't try to put _everything_ through main chain (which is TB-block level), it just would be wasteful, having localised sidechains is a very good idea, but planning around enough bandwidth on main chain to link everything else together is a good idea IMHO.

That's it, yes, thank you!
Ah, yes, they're using a burn-based sidechain. Which makes sense to get something up and running now, but means you end up with a much more complex protocol (where someone burns to get swapbill, then you buy it, then you trade it, then you sell the version you just traded). I think long term they've got the technically better solution, once we start seeing cryptocurrencies with lock-based sidechains, but I think the risk of transaction malleability is overstated.

I'm a little... wait, how much do you guys _have_ in BTC?

Certainly, for anyone without significant backing, and following the "don't invest more than you can lose" advice, I'd generally think current price point of a Trezor is a significant portion of total value contained.

Doesn't help with non-crypto/crypto exchanges, but I have a working prototype of atomic cross-chain trades for crypto/crypto transactions: 
You can read up on the theory at 
To be clear:
1. This is not a service, it's a piece of software that bridges between two reference clients. So far it's only been tested with Bitcoin/Dogecoin, but in theory it will work with any Bitcoin Core 0.9+ derived reference client (Litecoin's client is in testing at the moment, many new altcoins will have this). I imagine it can be extended to apply to crypto assets (Counterparty, Dogeparty, etc.) too, but haven't actually looked at that yet.
2. THIS IS A PROTOTYPE. It was thrown together in about a week just to see if the theory actually worked. It currently is hard-coded to the Bitcoin and Dogecoin test networks, please do not attempt main network usage yet. I'll probably try live network tests this weekend. Also it has no real UI, doesn't actually check the user is okay with the transaction... as said, proof of concept, not a finished product
3. Although it's not a service, it requires a communication layer to negotiate transaction details over. At the moment it uses reddit (the specific use-case was There's a lot more work to be done on this, and I have a lot of other things which need my time more urgently right now, so if you want to see this move forward now, dig in. A number of others should be getting involved in the next week or so.

I'm also going to suggest that it's because people aren't insisting on this stuff. As a general rule, at least short term the company with lower costs will succeed over those with higher costs. Proper audits are a cost.
Unless traders insist on public audits, an exchange would be somewhere between masochistic and suicidal to spend time implementing them, and right now given the tendency of people to leap head-first into whatever crazy coin/exchange is launched this week, I don't see that changing :(

I should clarify that I mean that patching Dogecoin to bring it in line with 0.10 is being worked on, and libsecp256k1 is therefore part of that. Everything gets a code review, test, and then at least a glance from a second developer (it's meant to be a second code review, but second scan is primarily for security), then a few months on our test network. So we're talking summer, and that of course presumes it is part of the Bitcoin Core 0.10's actual release version.

[BIP62]( addresses a lot of places malleability can occur, although it's hit some issues (I'm not sure of details, but I know the DER encoding part is being pushed ahead with separately from the rest of the specification as a result).
The other thing is, if/when sidechain support ever actually appears, this solution should be possible to adapt into a specialised sidechain with more effective controls on malleability.

I think the block size issue is vastly underestimated (I work on the reference client of an altcoin with a block rate 10x that of Bitcoin, so perhaps am slightly biased there), but I think really we have a bigger problem that it's still difficult to get Bitcoin.
I mean, yes, I can transfer money to Poland, wait three days, exchange it, and then send the coins to myself, but... that's not great. Actually in the UK I can use a real time service to buy Bitcoins with a bank transfer, and that's a lot better, but... this is still fiddly. If I'm wanting to buy something and I don't have enough Bitcoins, am I going to sort a bank transfer, or reach for the credit card? Sure, I know which I probably should do, but having lost 25% of some money I exchanged (the night before MtGox imploded) intending to use for a purchase, I'm certainly nervous.
We need to start asking to be paid in Bitcoins. Anyone doing consulting should absolutely be listing cryptocurrency addresses as a payment option. If your employer is interested, ask for part payment in Bitcoins. That's the next big step.
The other part of the puzzle being B2B transactions, so merchants don't end up constantly cashing out to pay their bills.
@_date: 2015-01-12 11:43:46
Ooh, that is an interesting idea. In particular the next big step is trying to add order matching, and the major headache there is how to avoid some sort of monetary DoS (as in someone keeps persuading people into trades they have no intention of completing, denying them access to their funds until the refund period). Requiring a payment in from both sides in the case where there's no knowledge of the other peer would help there.
Other thing that occurs is to have a trusted third party and use 2-3 multisig for the refund payment, as sort of a proto-escrow.
Edit: Oh, and there's even a BIP for this! I kind of wish I'd know that earlier. Still useful for later stage work...

It's not a large risk; for an single high value target (such as an exchange), if you can control the nodes they connect to (i.e. hack their upstream router), you can modify the relayed transactions. That doesn't seem like it applies here.
So the other risk is the miners modifying transactions, and yes that can happen, but so far at least seems exceedingly rare.

There's now at least 5 implementations of decentralised exchanges, in varying states of usability:
* [CATE]( for crypto/crypto. This is my project, tested with BTC/DOGE testnets only, mainnet tests should be tonight or tomorrow. Very much a technical proof of concept though, likely to undergo a complete rewrite to Java. Mostly held back waiting on improved TX malleability resistance on main chains.
* [Swapbill]( for crypto/crypto. First implementation, but uses dedicated sidechains and AFAIK there's no way of getting funds off the sidechains. The suggestion appears to be that you trade the sidechained funds for mainchain, but... that just means you move the problem around rather than solve it.
* [Mercury]( for crypto/crypto, as far as I am aware this is a much more friendly version of the same technology CATE uses.
* [Bitsquare]( for crypto/fiat, moving slowly but steadily onwards as far as I can tell
* [Qora]( for crypto/crypto, who tell me they have TX malleability fixed in their implementation

Bitcoin is currently at around 60-70 transactions/minute. My understanding is we can go to about 180-200 transactions/minute, so for now there's plenty of room to grow.
Yes, block size needs to be addressed, but it's not going to happen soon. If Bitcoin Core devs announced tomorrow they had come to a conclusion and were going to increase the size, I don't think the fork could come before July, given how much infrastructure needs to be updated. Realistically, I think the earliest we might see block size changes would be 2016.
So, for now, we'll have to work with what we've got, unfortunately.
@_date: 2015-01-09 10:58:09
Well, it's certainly a good start at least. Hopefully long term we'll see more individual cryptocurrency related companies having in-house code/specification contributors (which is what happens for most protocols), but we're a long way off that.

I've never seen someone try to discredit someone else by pointing out their relevant experience before...
If you have a solution to scaling transactions through Bitcoin main chain, I and many others would be interested in hearing it. However, my best theory is side chains (as in  ), while others back off chain (Lightning, etc.) I'm certainly not suggesting that changing currency in the middle is a good solution to scaling.
@_date: 2014-08-18 12:52:14
Trying really hard not to name it (because we got a really bad, and entirely deserved, reputation for turning up in and being high visibility, and it drove me crazy when other coins did the same to us), but to me its main difference is inflationary economic model instead of deflationary. The intent being that there is no long-term scarcity of supply beyond that created by adoption, and therefore we should have less of a speculative value.
Also faster block time.
I contribute back to Bitcoin's code where I can, at least.
Edit: By infighting, I mean crud like creating alt-accounts just to post FUD about coins. Seriously, happens a lot, trying to shake value out of our coin and into newer coins. Also more than a little fed up of being told I'm running a scamcoin without anyone looking into how little the devs are holding (we're all post-launch devs, so no pre-mine, no ICO and no early mine either).

Well, although I've just changed career and it would be frustrating to do it again, I could if it came to it. The point is more, I need to be paid. I do work on open source software, but my time available to do so is a tiny fraction of the time I have for a paying job.
Edit: I need to be paid if you want significant time devoted to such coding.
@_date: 2015-01-07 08:59:13
So, for everyone else, the main risks are that the transactions sending coins into the trade are modified, invalidating the refund transactions which are used in case of a problem. This doesn't give the coins to anyone else, although theoretically they could be held hostage in some way. My current implementation also uses TX ID to identify the transactions being relayed, however that can be modified later to use inputs and the output script.
TX malleability was one of the main motivators for using an indirect communications channel (reddit), so it's significantly harder to identify each peer's IP address in order to try intercepting their traffic. The main defence will come from BIP62 adoption, although I'm aware that's a while off still. Generally it's a significantly safer process than much of the existing "one side goes first" trades happening, but I do need to write a bit on the risks into the README.
I have seen a project that solved this via sidechains, although foolishly didn't keep a note of it. That's may be a better long term solution, depending on how effective BIP62 is.

Actual high frequency trading is, IMHO, a terrible thing, but probably not what you mean. 
Trade execution around the 1-2 second range is fine for liquidity and establishing value, and will probably have to remain on dedicated highspeed systems.
For most people, if they have one currency and need another, it's not a huge deal if it takes a few hours for the whole thing to complete (as long as it doesn't require them to be involved apart from setting up the trade).
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:12:03
Smooth is probably not the right word... it can be well planned and executed, but a large scale upgrade of the Bitcoin network is always going to be challenging. Bit of background; I co-ordinated a successful hard fork on one of the biggest altcoins (by number of nodes) late last year.
First of all, I absolutely support an increased block size. The size and change schedule are debatable, but Bitcoin cannot continue indefinitely with the current limit, or at least not without significant compromises being made to workaround the limitation.
Secondly, I think the code for this needs to go into the next version of Bitcoin Core. The longer the code is "out there", the more people will be using it from when they first install Bitcoin, the less nodes (by proportion) we have to get upgraded. Delaying this makes the upgrade progressively more difficult over time, and I feel that's ignored/understated.
For the change over, most node operators will upgrade early on. Mid-sized operations will be fine, it's the large and small ones you have to worry about. Really large operations (i.e. Coinbase) have custom node software (Toshi in Coinbase's case), so they actually need to write their own patches and apply those. Some mining pools run custom software, again they'll need to write updates and test (and given the amount of money involved, there's a lot of testing to do). The small operations may be poor at upgrading - we had an exchange fail to upgrade because (I kid you not) their only sysadmin was on 3 month vacation and out of contact.
So there's a lot of effort to go into such an upgrade, especially to get as many people as possible moved over, but it's doable.

The point was that generally those who try to do it properly self-select out of the market (I've seen a couple at least just give up), so there's a tendency towards those who either don't understand the risks, or don't address them, to be the ones you actually see.
I don't have easy answers here. Generally I'm favouring decentralised exchanges, but they have funding problems (there's no clear way of making money from a decentralised exchange, so development is on a volunteer basis basically)

Having led the communication effort on the last Dogecoin hard fork, the challenge is getting a majority to upgrade. In one memorable case, am exchange didn't upgrade, reportedly because their sysadmin was on holiday for three months.

3 months for a Bitcoin hardfork is extremely ambitious. I coordinated the fork for a major altcoin, with three months, and still had two exchanges miss the deadline despite repeated prompting. In one case, their sysadmin was apparently on holiday for 3 months:

They're not stopping losses, they're halting trading until tomorrow, because at least for now we haven't yet replaced all the traders with robots, so a lot of what happens when it drops 7% is they get more emotional and the effect snowballs. This forces them to take some time off, get some sleep, and then think about whether the shares are really worth what they're trading for, tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-05-11 15:50:19
I'm kind of in shock, obviously it's a doable schedule, but it's also an aggressive one. I've wondered if we might see Bitcoin down to 5 minute blocks, never expected 1 minute blocks.
Happy to help with metrics and analysis on Dogecoin's experiences with the schedule, though.
Edit: Although it's a lot simpler with the proposed O(1) block propagation, which reduces orphan risk. Wonder if the intent is to introduce that first...
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:29:27
Code's essentially done, the two questions are how much testing can be squeezed in before rolling out a patch to $3bn software, and how fast can people be convinced to upgrade.
My go-to example for the latter is an exchange that took ~6 months to decide to move after a hardfork, despite notice in good time, and claimed their sole sys-admin was on 3 month vacation: 
Personally, I think anything below 6 months notice for Bitcoin will result in widespread issues. 12+ months is a better timeline. Don't forget how many alternative clients, libraries, etc. need to be updated and tested as well.

Before you can spend it, or to move it to an external system? Serious question, I've avoided PayPal like the plague, but I thought funds received were immediately spendable.

@_date: 2015-05-08 09:52:20
Problem is, if you have 8 transactions a second constantly, one of those will never get into a block. Okay, so that's not a likely scenario, but over time if Bitcoin continues to grow, it _will_ get to the point where some transactions never confirm.
The question is, where do we draw the line (it's probably fine for free transactions to stop confirming, but what about ones with a fee attached?) Realistically we have to have other ways of spending Bitcoin than on the main chain, but 7tps is still very low even just for a global interchange between sidechains.
@_date: 2016-03-01 15:37:24
Yes, but there's still going to be transactions that cannot get through, all you're doing is shuffling around which get through until either I pay more than those whose transactions are dropped, or I can't afford to send my transaction.

I sort of agree, but look at what does run around 3-7 transactions per second, it's on par with current settlement network technology for a single country. That's the problem, we need more space even just to make Bitcoin a global scale network for settling Lightning network transactions.
Also,  says Visa can go up to 24,000 second, not 50,000.
@_date: 2016-01-15 11:13:21


I've seen a few attempts to make cryptocurrency exchanges, and what I've seen is if you try to do everything perfectly, someone less careful beats you to market, or on features, or both.
The market has no ability to tell if an exchange is secure, except it surviving or not in the long term, so doing security properly basically just slows down launch for no benefit, early on, and by then it's too late.
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:35:15


I'm not even sure what they're trying to do that involves Bitcoin, unless it's "I am the device that paid for &lt;x&gt;", which has a whole bunch of infrastructure missing.
Unless they actually have applications which use micro-amounts of Bitcoin (which would be far more exciting than this mining), they've solved a problem virtually no-one has.

Similarly there's:

Others as well, but basically there's a few out there that are truly decentralised (absolutely no centralised infrastructure), and operate on a peer to peer basis. However, because there's no central point, it's very hard to make a business model around these - ad supported might work (see Skype for example), but the target audience is likely to be extremely negative about that.
I should make a more serious fund raising attempt, see if someone will fund it as a startup with an intent to pivot to a different business model later...

I can't find a good model, which is what I meant by these are volunteer only. I think Bitsquare raised some crowdsourced funds, but Cate &amp; Mercury Ex are both free-time projects.
The "least terrible" business model is centralising trade matching, so you capture who's trading with whom, both for regulatory purposes, and  for selling on the details price history, demand, volume etc. Yes, I know it's a terrible model, that's why I've not even bothered trying to raise funds!
@_date: 2016-01-19 11:43:50


I'd sort of agree with this one, but suspect in reality if there's a large number of late-adopters that want to see this change, they're more likely to make an actual altcoin. More likely to succeed if they do that, anyway, IMHO, as rather than having to convince Bitcoiners to change, they have to convince everyone else their solution is better.


That's a heck of a leap, or specifically again you'd have some sort of actual altcoin if you want to centralize, that's so alien to Bitcoin's design that it's probably easier to start again.


That's a bigger concern, certainly, and presumably part of why there's an attempt to build a fee market now, to support mining later.
@_date: 2016-01-13 16:25:00
Sure, but when does your payment on PayPal arrive? The problem isn't the guys at the high-end paying $lots/transaction, it's everyone else whose transactions are never in a block. That's what I can't get through to people, without changes, there's a hard limit on number of transactions. Go over that consistently, and some never confirm.


I'd love to see any sort of logic on that.

Segwit is scheduled to be code-ready next month (April, for everyone reading this later): 
Even if Core supports it then, damn near nothing is ready for it: 
Even if Core supports it and services catch up, it _still_ has to actually activate via soft fork, likely to take 5 weeks to several months, based on the last couple of forks.

It's a point I need to check, but as I'm not in any way involved in the transaction, I've presumed that falls to the people actually partaking in the transaction (a lot like LocalBitcoins but over the Internet). The transactions are executed on the blockchain itself, so that may handle some of the audit requirements (you can publicly see the transaction amounts on each side, and they're exactly as anonymous as any other Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency transaction).

This is something that's sort of hard to get across to people, that information security is really hard because basically you're up against everyone, simultaneously.
Lets say the lock on a door isn't very good. Odds on, unless it's a very interesting door, the world's best lockpicker isn't going to wander by and open the door.
Counterpoint, lets say you have weak security on something Internet connected. The world's best hacker (or in fact top-100 or so hackers) will almost certainly at least try automated hacks against it, because they have the whole thing automated, so it costs them virtually nothing (they're probably using someone else's PC to do it anyway).
Here's a really terrifying statistic; an unpatched PC on an open Internet connection is expected to last 40 to 200 minutes (yes, the upper bound is under 4 hours) before it's hacked:  - and that lower bound may be optimistic (earlier research suggested around 15 minutes)
@_date: 2015-08-03 11:42:56
A comparison of altcoin vs Bitcoin economics perhaps? Supply, distribution, inflation/deflation design? Consider for example 42coin (very limited supply, but no demand, imploded), Dogecoin (designed as a joke with bizarre parameters, hit mining problems due to diminishing rewards, but still active), Auroracoin (distribution to a country's population). There's plenty of others, but essentially a lot of altcoins appear with changes to the Satoshi design, which then highlight why the original design was important.

Either they're right, or we're right. If they're wasting funds, they'll be back. If they're not, eh, happens.
Or, my personal pet theory, what they've discovered is the importance of having highly skilled developers with the freedom to do things right, rather than the way it's always been done, and the word "blockchain" is being used in much the way "REST" is in web applications (i.e. most people aren't really sure what it means, even fewer get it right)
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:55:44
It introduces risks that aren't present with a Trezor. You have to trust the PC you do set up on, for example, as the BIP 39 seed is presented via the PC, whereas for a Trezor it's only displayed on the Trezor. If your PC is hacked before you get a Ledger, they can screen cap the seed.
So, it's a huge improvement for most people, but the Trezor neatly avoids that risk entirely.
@_date: 2015-08-06 11:43:22

First problem - how do you uniquely identify people to remove them?
So someone creates 100 botnet accounts with 1 BTC each, they each deposit, wait a year, and withdraw along with the interest. You can ban the botnet accounts, but you're still out by a chunk of interest you have no mechanism for recovering, and they can create another 100 botnet accounts trivially.
I'm not saying it's impossible, because 10 years ago I'd have told you Bitcoin was impossible, but certainly I can't see any solution without some sort of identity handling and some really, really clever risk analysis.
@_date: 2015-08-14 13:34:42
I'm a little confused as to what you're trying to achieve.
How is this different to creating 4 HD wallets and splitting your funds across them? Alternatively, how is this different from having 4 public/private key pairs from an HD wallet and splitting funds from them?
Initial impression is that HD key handling is already a logistical nightmare to do securely (which is why we have hardware wallets to do it for us), and you'd need any design reviewed by a cryptography expert, but odds-on this is going to have subtle security implications I'm not qualified to spot.

You realise Bitcoin is just about moving from extreme early-adopter to merely early-adopter phase, right? That $3 billion market cap? That just about shows up on most finance companies' radar. HSBC was fined almost $2 billion (  ) and kept going, for perspective.

In the same way that the current 1MB limit doesn't mean every single block is 1MB, an 8MB limit won't mean 8MB blocks constantly. So, yes, theoretically it may one day increase 1,152MB/day, but probably not soon. Block pruning will massively help mitigate that increase too. Miners may well also refuse to mine 8MB blocks (this just raises the maximum the network will accept from miners).
In the unlikely event that the chain gets far too big to deal with, you would most likely move to an SPV client (typically 80 bytes per block plus the transactions that pay you, and nothing else).

It changes the risk profile. There's no central point that holds funds, so you can't have avalanche failures such as MtGox (where an initial failure becomes a much bigger one over time). For fiat/crypto transactions, I believe the theory is each side put up a stake in BTC, and in case of problems their stake can be forfeit - honestly not too sure of the details, it's on my huge list of things to read up on.
For crypto/crypto, [atomic cross-chain transactions]( will be essentially as secure as any other cryptocurrency transaction, once transaction malleability is fixed.
@_date: 2015-07-08 11:03:07
I'm presuming you mean that if there's an issue with the Bitcoin main chain, you can end up with invalid coins moved to a sidechain and causing problems there? I have wondered about time-limited side chains, so coins can be moved off during a window to seed a new side chain, and are then locked out for security (so even if the main chain fails the side chain can continue).
Still, something people seem to forget with sidechains is, who's going to write them? Existing altcoin devs have a to-do list that stretches to ~2030, and there's very few people moving into the space and wanting to launch non-ICO/premined coins (which a side-chain inherently is). It might become an interesting experimental space for new developers, but we're a long way off that.
@_date: 2015-08-13 09:28:39
Which is mostly true (I think the risk is overstated), if we jump straight from 750kB blocks to 8MB. That's not what's happening here, we're letting the network accept 8MB blocks, and miners can then mine _up to_ 8MB if there's transactions to fill the blocks. It's about giving the network room to grow, not trying to jump straight to 8MB.

Changing mining parameters significantly post launch is essentially suicide (because you'll be hunted down and killed by miners, coin holders, or both). I would add that I wasn't on the dev team when they opted to retain the parameters as coded rather than hard-fork away from them.
So presuming you mean if I could go back and change Bitcoin at launch, would I add inflation? Honestly don't know, it's certainly made our short-term much harder than it would have been otherwise, because there's no direct financial incentive to use the coin, and people are bad at prioritising the long term. I imagine we won't know until a few Bitcoin halvings from now, and we see how late adopters react to the Bitcoin price.
Doesn't answer my first question though.

Regulation is... oh goodness that's a huge area. A good start might be looking at regulation as it applies to scams so far - MtGox and Moolah were both registered as money services businesses, if I recall correctly (Moolah definitely was, because it was part of the checks we did on the company). Could look at why regulation hasn't helped, what changes are in the pipeline (Bitlicense and similar), what could be done (i.e. better accounting practices?), whether regulation or user education (i.e. training on how to spot scams) is likely to be more effective.

IMHO zero-conf is dead already and just hasn't realised it yet.

@_date: 2015-07-17 12:38:29
It's the not just the mining effort, it's bandwidth, disk usage and simply transaction validation, all of which scale _at best_ linearly with transaction volume. Relaying every transaction globally through a single huge stream of data doesn't scale, which is the point of side chains and off chain transaction networks.
We'd be looking at GB-range blocks to try matching a single credit card network at today's rates (thousands of transactions per second vs a current limit of 3-7 per second). Moving that up to include all transactions globally would likely put us in the terabyte range. Easy to do if you're spreading it across thousands of payment networks, but not really going to happen on home hardware for a single network.

Something I'm trying to do at the moment is move altcoins away from this model of forking and re-writing code. It ends up that they diverge progressively from Bitcoin equivalents over time, making it harder to merge upstream. I have wrapper libraries for bitcoinj and python-bitcoinlib that extend them to add altcoin support, rather than replace them, and I'm starting to look at how the same can be done for Bitcoin Core. That should help too, as we're then burning less effort to keep alts up to date, and less to merge changes back.
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:15:06
I should have said, this would be used offline. Given all persistence is to SD card, you get the key off the Raspberry Pi (by writing it down or otherwise) and then destroy the card, or reformat if you're not that paranoid. It seems to me to be safer than having to worry about balance of dice or correctly shuffling cards.
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:56:33
Dogecoin Core 1.10 is going that route, more or less. We're factoring out as much of the Doge-specific parts out of the main Bitcoin Core code base to make it a less invasive change set. Have a look at  (although it's still early, so maybe look at it in a week or two). Definitely want to make it a thin wrapper around Bitcoin Core, in time, though.
I'd advise against trying to merge in recent Bitcoin Core changes, they're absolutely huge, it's likely faster to rebuild the whole codebase around a recent version. That's sort of why I'm trying to make Doge a thin wrapper of course, to cut down on the update times...

Zero-conf is dead, it just hasn't stopped twitching yet. To be fair, I'm biased in that I work on a coin with 1 minute block times, but as blocks get fuller, it's going to become very hard to know for sure a transaction will ever be mined. For now we mostly trust miners not to do things like replacing seen transactions with versions with higher fees, but given they're already SPV mining for the reward increases that gives them (despite the risks), I think the model that seeing a transaction on the network means it will be mined is basically over.
I'm not sure why no-one's pushing for a Bitcoin block time decrease as part of the transaction throughput increase, as an aside. I know Gavin mentioned it somewhere, but it then seems to have dropped off the radar.

Agreed - four months to hard fork Bitcoin seems ambitious, to me (which is why I've been jumping up and down waving my hands, because I think lead time is vastly underestimated for something which requires most if not all implementations to be updated and re-tested), but it's better to have a chance we can deploy better technology before we hit a wall, at least.

Actually, it's just peeling a layer off the technology. They're not interested in the currency, they want to the tasty tasty blockchain underneath.

On  - IMHO the network-enforced block size should only be an emergency stop, miners should be considering and setting their own block size limits based on what they can sustain (i.e. a miner with faster Internet access should be able to hoover up more fees than one without, to pay for that infrastructure), vs their own need to create demand (i.e. if it's set too high, fees will be too low).

It's interesting that what Spats_McGee lists definitely isn't what I think banks want. My (outsider) understanding is they're far more interested in proving a sequence of events - what happened, when it happened, and in what order. Or simply in asserting state at a point in time. They may track who holds assets over time, in a private blockchain, but I don't think that data is expected to be exposed outside the organisation, rather it's used to prove integrity of the data.
Again, this is all inference from what I see from outside.

I'd have more faith in Bram Cohen if he hadn't claimed nothing happened beyond fees going up ( which is clearly wrong, that's just the first stage, and we'll see transactions fail as load exceeds available resources.
If we're appealing to authority, I'd counter with Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen, again both of whom have a vast amount of experience working on the reference client. Personally, with ~20 years development experience, a CS PhD and 15 months on an altcoin, I'm not too worried that I'm out of my depth!
Edit: I think it's important to say - yes, there are challenges in increasing block size. That doesn't mean we don't have to, it just means we're in between a rock and a hard place. I suppose, really, my point is more we can't do _nothing_, and given the lead time on hard forking something as big as Bitcoin, we need a decision about a month ago.

I'm also not saying we can jam everything through the main chain, but we can't even support the interconnects between other networks, with the current limits, even if those other networks are delivered in time before we hit real problems (unclear).
3 transactions per second is around the current connectivity of CHIPS, the US interbank-only clearance network. Even if we forget the idea that individuals might use Bitcoin main chain, and anyone outside the US using it, _at best_ we'd have zero headroom spare. I don't know quite how to get across how hopelessly inadequate the current limit is if we expect Bitcoin usage to increase significantly.

Unless anyone has a solution we're not seeing, Bitcoin infrastructure costs are high, and as block rewards go down, transaction fees and mining costs need to meet somewhere. I can't see a scenario where a deflationary coin has ongoing low fees.

Litecoin &amp; Dogecoin are similar technologically to Bitcoin, but with shorter block times (2.5 minutes and 1 minute respectively). They get a theoretical 4 and 10 times throughput increase as a result. Actual throughput on any Bitcoin-like chain will be constrained by the miners; if they mine smaller blocks then that limits the network, and equally if they mine blocks bigger than can be relayed before a smaller block is found and relayed, that limits the network.
Edit: Try for such questions, in future, they're a lot friendlier about altcoin discussion.

Dogecoin support for hardware wallets is on my to-do list, but we're basically reworking everything around a model of Dogecoin support being minor changes to existing applications, rather than having our own fork of applications, which is taking a while. Results are also mixed (Android Wallet and Multibit HD are both clear on not wanting multi currency support, so we have to have forks of those anyway, but we can at least modify bitcoinj so that Dogecoin support is a trivial add-on)

The point of forcing a fee market appears to be to give miners as much money per kb of block data as they can manage. If you're a miner, this is (at least short term) good for you, because transaction fees should stop being trivial.
That said, mining has nearly perfect competition, the point where it made good money for the average person is long gone, IMHO. Barrier to entry is low, so there is constant new competition. If 21 Inc actually launch their own mining chips too, you can expect this to go to hell (keep in mind that mining rewards are not scaled based on difficulty, so more miners means less for each miner).
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:41:59
There's a lot of complexity in that having miners outright fighting ends badly (because a small number could intentionally lose money to wipe out the competition), so it may be that the network limit has to be closer to what we think miners might be able to handle stably (feel the uncertainty!), but that's difficult to assess.
Also if 21 Inc release a working product, it'll obliterate current models (because mining becomes a convenience rather than directly profit-making)
@_date: 2015-07-09 09:45:33
From the sounds of things, there's some very good compromise positions where just changing out the type of signature cuts a huge chunk off the total size without adding all that much more complexity to transaction format. I know there's some concerns raised about the use of the secp256k1 curve, and moving away from that may be desirable anyway, but don't actually understand this in enough detail to even pretend I could assess security of alternatives.
Definitely sounds like a good idea for a side chain though!
@_date: 2015-07-09 10:08:42
I think it was more generally a feeling that it's better to use random curves. Fully admit I don't know enough elliptic curve cryptography and need to frantically learn when I can find time.
Pretty much sounds ideal for a sidechain, as it means a small amount of test value can be moved over, and if it turns out someone hacks the signatures and steals the money, it's an unpleasant learning experience rather than a disaster.

I wrote an earlier post on this which seems mostly to have been missed: 
I'm referring to existing code which currently basically of the form "At height 0, parameters are x. At height n, they become y," etc. - although probably should be time-based (enables block validation without all previous blocks). So mostly this needs a configuration loading step, although there's potentially other considerations. For example, it may be desirable for clients to announce which consensus parameters they're running/will run next, so adoption can be monitored across the network. This wouldn't allow arbitrary changes (i.e. if you want Scrypt/X11 mining instead, someone would need to code the functionality, this would just it easier to configure the fork across)
That all said, this wasn't entirely meant to be something the devs run with. Giving arbitrary users the ability to edit consensus is dangerous (mostly to the user, to be fair), so shouldn't be done lightly. I was more trying to point out that we're constantly told core devs don't control the coin, but also they do control the coin, and wanted to shove the discussion along to a more coherent conclusion.

Mostly agreed - the blocksize limit enforced by the network should reflect the maximum that can be safely handled (i.e. to avoid someone attacking miners/the blockchain with megablocks).

Okay... but bandwidth is part of that. At the moment costs to miners are virtually all electricity and hardware, which China excels at doing cheaply. Introducing a requirement of better bandwidth should in theory mean we don't have virtually all mining happening in China.
That said unless we can figure how to stop people using SPV mining, they don't download the blocks they're mining on anyway, so doesn't matter :-/ It's presumed for this purpose that they can and will keep block size mined below a level they can cope well with.

I also don't think there's a single solution - I see people who think block size increases are as proposed alternative to Lightning/sidechains/whatever, but IMHO they're part of a solution. The current block size is absurdly limited, we need bigger blocks just to interconnect other solutions if we genuinely want to see Bitcoin in widespread usage.
The [flowchart of solutions]( is well worth thinking about - yes, there are problems with block size increases, but if we can't make blocks bigger, we're basically screwed (and I don't mean Bitcoin, I mean every single current generation decentralised cryptocurrency).

A blockchain is just a strictly ordered set of data. Bitcoin happens to use it to enforce the order of transactions, and motivates mining by rewarding miners with Bitcoins, but you can use it for any data. it's just an issue of how your mining works. One option might be to merge-mine Bitcoin (so additional overheads are tiny) and issue Bitcoin payments based on mining effort done (i.e. a chain "owner" buys Bitcoin and then gives them to miners, rather than they're generated).

Well, there's the fairly epic case back in 2010 of 184 billion Bitcoins being sent (  ), so it has happened. There's a full list of reference client security issues to date at  . So, while the protocol is sound, implementations definitely do have issues that have been exploited.

Diving in at 0.6, I found myself running around between files trying to track down individual parts. I personally find 0.10/0.11 _much_ easier to read, but I get the impression from what has said that the adopted style may be less readable from their point of view.
Either way, absolutely nothing wrong with first version of some code being duct-taped together to make it work. I've known far too many projects that never get off the ground because their devs tried to do it right first time, as opposed to make it work to prove the theory first. That said, I think we need to be more prepared to throw away the first versions.

I think this underestimates how much work has gone into Bitcoin post-launch. I bought into Bitcoin back in 2011, and I bought small (I think I had 4 BTC at one point, but spent 2 on something) because at the time my analysis was Bitcoin was too much of a prototype, and odds on it wouldn't succeed. I stand by that assessment, it beat the odds, but back then believing in Bitcoin required a huge amount of faith in highly unproven technology.
That said, my first introduction to Bitcoin was on Slashdot in 2010, when a lot of self-proclaimed experts were nonsensing it simply because they didn't understand it...

Ah, so as we (Doge) hard forked everyone onto a 0.9-derived client back in September, we might be okay for a bit at least?
Dogecoin Core 1.10 (which is 0.11 derived - 1.9 was a painful lesson in how not to merge changes) achieves full consensus sync and is basically waiting on a rebrand and testing, so generally I'd rather focus effort there if we've got time.
@_date: 2015-07-08 10:06:31
Doge uses similar fee rules (1 DOGE per kb _rounded up_, plus 1 DOGE per output below 1 DOGE), however the very low base fee means that it's probably partially vulnerable. We subsidise fees using inflation, but I think we do need to re-evaluate fees and bring them up closer to realistic costs - still talking a lot lower than Bitcoin, but not so low that spam attacks are as easy.

It's more than _just_ uncertainty in the technology, and I imagine for many that having enough financial buffer to make the leap is important, but certainly I don't think many people have the resources (irrespective of desire) to work full time for something that will never pay. So, yes, I'd imagine we'll see a ramp-up of development effort once things are stabler.

I'll try to break it down into bits to think about, rather than a conclusion:
* Bitcoin blocks can be no bigger than 1mb (controlled by the network)
* Blocks are generated about once every 10 minutes
* Given average transaction size (anyone got that to hand) and the above two facts, Bitcoin main chain can handle 3-7 transactions per second sustained
* Blocks are about 75% full now, with the point where they're consistently full expected sometime next year-ish.
* One option is to change the protocol to increase maximum block size and/or decrease transaction size
* Another is to use side-chains to spread load onto other chains rather than down a single path
* Another is to use off-chain networks (i.e. Lightning network), using a more efficient technology for fast transactions
Changing the protocol is dangerous because it involves a hard fork (i.e. all current clients must be updated to use the new specification). Other options are still works in progress (i.e. we can't guarantee they'll be available in time).
My own opinion is we need both increased block size and other options layered on top of it. For context on 3 transactions per second, that's comparable to CHIPS (the US interbank-only clearance network) today, so essentially even if we presume no-one uses Bitcoin main chain itself long-term (but just clears funds between other systems), it would handle the US-only workload of today with no scope to expand.

@_date: 2015-07-24 13:28:24
Then the miners should be setting block size limits (that they'll mine) low enough to drive scarcity. Essentially it's very difficult if not impossible for core devs to determine what a workable limit is for miners, as they all have different costs. Putting mining farms next to hydroelectric plants means cheap electricity, but expensive bandwidth. Putting them in data centres inverts that equation. Hybridising the two by mining near a hydroelectric plant and having the data-intensive parts done on a remote server is the best option, but trickier to set up.
So we want to have miners compete but also set barriers. A miner should set their own block size limits based on what they can manage, their own fee minimum based on their costs (bandwidth in the short term, disk &amp; memory in the long term), and then try to get the highest fees they can within those two limits. This gives us competition between miners and a fee market (higher fees means more miners will mine your transaction rather than it being left to budget offerings). There's no centralisation of these parameters either, so they can be adapted as mining costs change.
@_date: 2015-07-16 07:27:03
So the question again, why don't we change:
to "60" (seconds), and Bitcoin gets first confirmation 10x as quickly, and 10x the transaction throughput as a bonus? Okay, so it's a hard fork, and we need support framework for that (I can provide this), but it's a clear benefit, right?
The answer is not that it's difficult (although at 60 second confirmations everything does start shaking a bit), but that Bitcoin has inertia from its network effect.

Fine; a block consists of a header and body, the header including amongst other details the SHA256 hash of the previous block (in little endian order), a Merkle tree root for the elements of the body (in the case of Bitcoin, transactions), a nonce value used as part of the mining process, and the difficulty target the block is mined against, in compact format (full clients calculate this manually, but SPV clients may use it at as short-cut in verifying the header integrity). Each block header refers to the previous block header, forming a chain. As this is a singly linked list, multiple headers can refer to the same previous header (this is a fork), and in which case the chain with the "most work" (assessed by lowest hash values) is used in preference.
I just thought "strictly ordered set of data" was a bit shorter. I can dig out the details on the header fields I've skipped over if you really want.

Partly, it's risk appetite. If anything goes wrong with Bitcoin Core in a major way, it could undermine cryptocurrency as a whole and bring everything crashing down around our heads. Even a major alt such as Lite/Doge (and before you think I'm joking about Doge, I'm a Doge developer) has a lot more freedom to experiment, in relative terms.
There's also a risk of feature expansion, the reference client should be a basic stripped down client, that's why it's a reference. We have alternative wallets (Multibit HD, etc.) for the fancy stuff, without turning the main client into a mess of features.
That said, we're currently re-writing Dogecoin around Bitcoin Core 0.11, and I may well try merging our paper wallet generator into the core main client again (it was rejected and suggested it should be standalone, but personally I think it makes more sense in a single application). Will probably then resubmit as its own application if that doesn't work though.

Can I just say - that's certainly not my argument. My argument is that the guy whose transaction is dropped because the fees are too low is having a terrible user experience, and that's fine while we get closer to maximum block size, but eventually we get to the point that however much you pay, _someone_ doesn't get their transaction through. If the network continues to grow past that point, we get to a stage where users have no guarantee they can actually send their Bitcoins.
You want to guess how valuable money you can't use is?
@_date: 2015-07-22 09:04:02


That's not necessarily workable in a direct sense. Lets say Bitcoin does go global. Current population of the earth is 7 billion people, lets say half of them have the ability to use Bitcoin. If each of them makes one transaction per day, we have 3.5 billion transactions per day.
1MB blocks run to around 300,000 transactions per day (3 * 60 * 60 * 24). So we're about 6 orders of magnitude too low. Running globally would give us somewhere in the region of 1TB blocks. If infrastructure grows at Moore's law, that may be achievable in 20-30 years, but there's concerns that memory won't (  ) and that we're hitting the limits anyway (  ).
So it's important both that we have bigger blocks (because 1MB is an absurdly small limit) and scale in parallel too (i.e. sidechains and Lightning network).

The suggested solution if bandwidth requirements actually become a serious stumbling block is that miners have a remote server in a high-bandwidth location. This collects transactions, creates a block header and relays it back to mining HQ to actually complete. The resulting mined header is then sent back to the remote system for relaying. Bitcoin block headers are (currently) 80 bytes, so this is essentially inconsequential, and the minor time delay getting the header to/from the remote system should be dwarfed by time saved by having a high bandwidth node.
There's a long, long way to go before the blocks are too big for even a fairly good home connection, though.
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:21:11
Again, the main issue we have is trying to jam progressively more transactions down a single stream doesn't scale (because it means every node must have bandwidth, storage &amp; CPU sufficient to process that many transactions). The current load vs global scale is like comparing a stream and the ocean (we need to plan for at least a 10,000 times increase in transaction volume if it goes global, more if you want microtransactions). Block scaling is required to make it function as a backbone, but long term that's all it should be.
That's why we're saying off-chain and side-chain solutions, because instead of trying to jam 10,000 times the load through a single stream, we push 10 times the load through a 1,000 independent networks. It's basic parallelisation.
Edit: The maths is simple - take target audience size (7 billion people), typical number of transactions per day (I make 1-2, is that typical?), you have 14 billion transactions per day. At 3 transactions per second, we can handle just under 3 million transactions per day.  Okay, so only a 5,000 times increase (5 GB blocks every ten minutes, ignoring load spikes)
Edit 2: and that ignores the much faster approaching UTXO space issue 
@_date: 2015-07-17 12:10:42
Okay, however unless you have a solution to spam mitigation and cost of infrastructure vs block rewards decreasing, telling us that reality is inconvenient doesn't change anything. Microtransactions survived because there wasn't enough adoption to push them out, and the security implications of allowing them were not so dire as to require immediate attention. This has changed.

RBF doesn't fix this, it simply makes it less sucky. If there's 4 transactions per second sustained, 1 of those transactions won't make it through, whatever you do. There's no magic formula where we can get 4 transactions through a system that handles 3, you can only shuffle around which are prioritised. Obviously yes there will be a period where it's at ~3 transactions per second and RBF lets you bump cheap transactions to later blocks, but eventually it just exceeds the network.
Further, planning based on current usage is good way to be Voat, and any adoption event cripples you. As an example, there's numerous posts about how Greece should adopt Bitcoin. Greece has a population of about 11 million people. If each of those people make a single transaction per day, you would be looking at 127 transactions per second on average (11,000,000 / 24 / 60 / 60). Except of course that's never going to be true, transactions will primarily be daytime, so really we're talking closer to 250 transactions per second. It would make the current backlog look like a drop in the ocean.

By "advantage of some sort" I'm going to infer you mean swamping the resources of other mining pools in an attempt to significantly slow their mining.
The 8MB limit was proposed by the Chinese mining pools, who are fairly much considered the worst-case scenario for bandwidth. If this did happen, and was somehow bad enough that bandwidth was a major issue, they can put a full node in a remote (to them) data centre (Digital Ocean is fine for this, but there are other options), have it handle bandwidth &amp; validation, and only the block headers (fixed at 80 bytes) are relayed to/from this data centre and the mining farm.

I think it's excessive to say it doesn't work, however you introduce huge risks. PoS encourages people and services to keep their wallets online (as opposed to in paper wallets), and it means any major currency theft hands your mining power to someone who's known to have malicious intent. The [Vericoin hack from Mintpal]( illustrates this well, resulting in a catastrophic loss of coins that had to be hard-forked to recover, and a resulting huge loss of confidence in the coin.
However, people are bad at dealing with such risks, and while something works, tend to presume it will continue to work, so alts continue with it.
Also, and I say this as an alt dev, ~95% of altcoins are much more interested in making short term gains for their devs than actually being sustainable.

I think they mean as in you got it from the shop and never updated. You fairly much have to fight modern Windows / OS X to stop it from applying security updates, these days (it's rumoured that Windows 10 is in fact the terminator of security updates, and will absolutely not rest until all patches are applied).
Been years since I had a Mac, but  might help?
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:53:01
Let me put this another way - this is fairly fundamental in how Bitcoin works right now, if you trust invalid blocks, there's not much the devs can do about that. There's fork monitoring tools in the main client, but many don't have them actually notifying anyone, and I have no idea if any SPV clients have the same.
If that seems like a major stumbling block, I'd suggest not keeping too much in cryptocurrency until and unless a solution is found. Side chains may help (because updates can be deployed as a new sidechain and money moves to the side chain to "upgrade"), although fundamentally if we can't find a solution to main chain security updates (which BIP66 is), that's really bad.

Trezor or Ledger would be my suggestions. Sounds like Ledger's probably a better fit if you're not holding a lot, as it's cheaper (but you do have to trust the machine you do first set up on).
Both are set and forget, and can be recovered to other wallet technologies (each other, Multibit HD, etc.) from the seed words you'll be given during set up (just make sure you write down those words!)

I will say, as an altcoin dev, there's a few people with details on how to contact me in case of an emergency, and that does (and has) included waking me in the night if needed. I imagine some contingency is in place for Bitcoin devs.
However... there's basically no ability to react, because we can't deploy software. If it's a major service provider having wallet problems, yes, we can advise on recovery, but if the network forks we basically point sleepily at a pre-written contingency plan and leave those in the right timezones to manage comms, because we can't actually do much. This is emphasised by the BIP66 fork, where despite prompts here, on the Bitcoin Dev mailing list, etc. pools were running software which didn't correctly check block versions, months after the release actually came out.
It's not impossible for a P2P network to deploy changes quickly, but I think it is unrealistic for anything that's in any way controversial (and again, BIP66 was a clear security improvement, nothing that required extensive discussion), especially where there's no specific leadership group. If Bitcoin wants rapid clear decisions, it needs a better way of making decisions.

Oh, and I absolutely agree that there's a market for a $5 hardware wallet. Some people are going to want to carry small (&lt;$100) amounts of cryptocurrency on them to use day to day, in time, and a $5 wallet is perfect for that sort of audience.
Thought of talking to exchanges about selling pre-loaded wallets? They could put $20 of crypto onto a wallet, sell it as a bundle, and get an address from the wallet before it ships so they know where to send any further coins the user buys.

It's actually really, really bad. Imagine someone releases a transaction that only validates on Linux; mining pools will most likely accept it, mine it, and produce a block that forks every single Windows/OS X user off the main chain. They're now on a very low hashrate chain that's susceptible to 51% attacks.
Edit: Bonus, how the hell do you reconcile that? Retrospective hard fork to put everyone on the weak chain?
@_date: 2015-07-16 08:44:52
The problem is that we can't quickly change Bitcoin (IMHO). The recent fork from BIP 66 should illustrate that - a non-controversial security fix caused 3-4 days of forks months after the client was released. Lead time on a hard fork is at least 6 months, and for something that will require virtually all current implementations to be changed and re-tested, I'd suggest 12 months.
We need to be planning a year ahead, not leaving it to the last few weeks.

Actually, the exchange says someone's giving you the other side. So you deposit USD and buy BTC, which the exchange says are then yours. You might withdraw your BTC, but many don't, so for a while the pool of "real" BTC is big enough to cover withdrawals. However, the exchange can sell you BTC it doesn't really have, and pocket the USD. That's what the whole proof of liquidity thing is meant to fix, showing that the exchange has the money they say they do.
Oh, also, you should read up on [naked shorting]( it's terrifying.
@_date: 2015-07-08 07:42:21
Exactly - spikes in traffic will sort themselves out as long as they drop below sustained rate eventually. The problem is if sustained rate goes over ~3 transactions per second, we lose transactions, because there's never a point where the backlog clears.

Something I've tried to say where I've been involved in the discussions is that I do have a lot of respect for people on both sides. Obviously I think the other side is wrong, but they're an informed, well considered sort of wrong. Bottom line, it's not a simple problem, and we have a myriad of conclusions that people are trying to sift through which makes it worse.
Personally I think if we overflow the transactions the network can handle, we'll see a panicked spike as people rush to move funds to exchanges to cash out into something they can use, others feel instead we'll see a dip in adoption to compensate. I don't think we can run a clearance network on the current limits, even if Lightning is delivered in time and does everything it promises - others feel we can find further efficiency gains to make it workable.
Not entirely sure where I'm going with this... erm... be awesome to each other?
@_date: 2015-07-09 09:49:14


I have to say, if Bitcoin is forking for a block size increase anyway, changing transaction format to reduce size and malleability risk at the same time sounds like a good idea (I'm aware it may be politically complicated to combine two hard fork changes, however).
@_date: 2015-07-27 10:37:07
Rusty Russell did some really good analysis on how this looks in the real world: 
A full 8MB block will take within an error margin of 8 times a full 1MB block. However, an 8MB network limit doesn't mean 8MB blocks being mined, it means miners can mine up to 8MB. Blocks aren't expected to hit the 1MB limit until 2016, so this is more about raising the limit so growth can occur, rather than we'll suddenly be dealing with vastly larger blocks.

Okay... so I'm probably not going to make myself popular if I say I think Bitcoin (and in fact any original chain) is fated to become primarily a settlement network; still, I see no reason to rush headlong into such an outcome, nor do I think the Bitcoin block size is enough to run a settlement network on (that's how bad it is).

Agreed... it's a daft comment and illustrates a lack of understanding of the actual risks, but it's not _that_ stupid.

Slightly more complex than that - you want addresses where coins held cannot be sent irreversibly. Otherwise having the wallet stolen is still a disaster, so while you it does help if a merchant screws you over, it's only half the problem.
So to my mind you want "Long term storage" addresses where there's a 3-7 "cooling off" period after coins are sent, in which they can be recovered. Of course, if the coins are stolen by someone with your keys, how do you resolve who should get the reclaimed coins...
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:57:44
Sort of. 
Okay, so, 6 confirmations on a faster coin is not the same as 6 confirmations on Bitcoin. However, an hour on both is the same, barring any screwups in implementation. 
However, a faster time to first confirmation is an improvement for end users. That said it's a compromise against chances of an orphan block, so miners may not like it (and you need them for a hard fork). 
I suspect the core devs will tell you to use sidechains for fast transactions.

There are potential applications where the blockchain is used to manage non-currency assets (such as stocks) and merge mined with another blockchain (such as Bitcoin), with users paying transaction fees indirectly to motivate miners.

@_date: 2015-04-13 21:52:10
It needs to support more transactions, this doesn't necessarily mean on the main chain. I do think it needs a bump even if sidechains handle the bulk of transactions in future, though, 7 transactions per second is tiny even just for a backbone that handles movement between sidechains

I have to admit I've given up on new alt currency launches at least. Blockchain-based platforms may have some interesting stuff in short-term, but right now I see no hard technical obstacles to Bitcoin adoption, they're all marketing, political or usability. I see all these currencies that are the "next big thing" because they have smart contracts, and I'm "Sure, and... what's wrong with the smart contract support in Bitcoin and Bitcoin-alikes?"
Cryptocurrency adoption needs the existing technology to be more approachable, not to layer yet more stuff in that virtually no-one actually will use.
@_date: 2015-04-04 20:10:54
Okay... other examples I've seen include [Darkwallet]( , which has done okay in the end, but still vastly below market rate for developers and the [Bitsquare]( decentralised exchange. Darkwallet is of particular note given how successful Darkcoin (now Dash) has been in comparison, and to me illustrates that people hate donating, but will happily "buy in" to anything if they think they can get rich from it.
I'd love to be proven wrong on this, I really would, I think it would be incredible to see Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) development funded on a donation model by the general users (not, as seems to be the current case, almost entirely by a relatively small group of high net worth individuals).

You can get most of the same functionality with Apache Axis. It's basically grid services (a specialisation of web services) with a payment layer.

I think fundamentally they're trying to solve an entirely different problem. It's one I've struggled with, certainly, of how to produce digital records that you can be certain aren't tampered with. Digital signatures are a good start, but a blockchain gives you a complete and well tested solution. It also gives you easy replication so damaged data can be corrected.
@_date: 2015-09-16 08:07:09
Block structure is also remarkably difficult to pin down in detail, you end up dashing between specs, and nothing remembers to point you to the BIPs that affect things (i.e. you're only ever likely to realise that block height goes in the coinbase transaction script by reading code or by going through each BIP one by one).

Also having actually forked a coin (Dogecoin) before, what you'll find is it's not getting most people to upgrade, it's getting everyone to upgrade. Expect that upgrade rate to slow around 60-70%.

How are they going to solve the 3-7 transaction per second transaction limit?
Given estimates put mining output at $0.25/day, how small are we talking as micropayments? Current transaction fees alone are $0.0.1-0.02. With the increased difficulty from new miners coming online and the reward halving coming up mid-2016,  that available credit becomes even less.
Why do I want their solution instead of another software platform? How do my IoT devices (which I don't have, but hey, lets pretend) get funds from this device, or do I buy a $400 miner for each?
@_date: 2015-09-04 13:13:37
Yes, but it's well tested cryptography with minimal changes to switch PoW for (probably) proof of signature. The hard part of a solution isn't finding one, it's having something robust and well tested, and the blockchain is both very well understood and tested, and remarkably hard to break.

They don't (certainly my UK bank doesn't), and believe me I'm facepalming over how dumb the lack of it is.
However, yes, I think it's down to effective tools. I've got a [Ledger]( wallet I'm experimenting with at the moment, and the interaction is a lot more user friendly. Initial setup isn't great (write down 24 words onto a piece of card, and if the system you're using is compromised, you're screwed), but once done essentially you go to any PC, go to the web site, put the USB device into the computer, enter your PIN, up comes your balance. If you want to send money, you do 2FA to verify. There's risks (losing the device is bad, losing the card much worse, so somehow you need to worry about its physical security), but they're much more something the average person understands.

* [Bitsquare](
* [Mercury](
* [CATE](
However, there's no profit model in a purely decentralised exchange (because you trade directly between two people, and there's no central point), which cuts down on development resources available. Bitsquare raised crowdsourced funding I think (I know they tried to, not entirely clear if they succeeded at all), both of the other projects are strictly "As I have time/anyone submits changes" basis. I could have sworn I saw some decentralised exchange raise VC funding, no idea how they're intending to make a profit.

Surely a correctly functioning exchange would have had rapidly increasing income based on fees on each transaction, though, right? Unless MtGox was acting as market maker (which I don't believe they were), they shouldn't have been directly affected by the price of Bitcoin, and even if they held some of their own funds as Bitcoin that means they should have been doing better.
Also, the lost coins/funds are reportedly close to 50x times the figure's you've given ( so while they wouldn't have helped, they should in no way caused this liquidity crisis.

Deflation means dropping prices actually... however Bitcoin is deflationary in the very long term, what we're seeing at the moment is inflation (probably driven by rapidly diminishing confidence).
Your basic point is correct, though. Any serious company is unlikely to want to spend the time &amp; money to evaluate Bitcoin, implement payments using it, and then deal with constantly having to trade out of Bitcoin to lock value into a currency they can actually use, while tweaking prices to compensate for a market that's moving at an insane pace.

I meant a well tested implementation, and really I meant the framework within which it's used. First attempt for what I'm thinking of was signed PDFs - same basic sort of technology, but managing them is a right pain; if you keep them on disks they're easier to change, if you put them on CDs you have to test the CDs every year or so, becomes a progressively more time consuming task. It occurs to add, this is not intended a solution to solve a problem of tracking data over a short period of time, but how we prove consistency of data over decades.
Signing blocks as an alternative to PoW should be good enough (presuming keys are protected well) to avoid double-spend equivalents (which in this case would be alternative record paths). It helps that over short time scales (year or so), it's not that difficult to rebuild the dataset if damaged, it's over extended periods where backups become harder to find.

Honestly, miners are going to SPV mine from here on because it's easy, but if they want to do it properly and bandwidth is an issue, they can rent a VPS for ~$7/month in a server farm somewhere, and just relay block headers to/from the low-bandwidth site (fixed at 80 bytes for Bitcoin, less if they don't include the hash).

I think the author puts far too much faith in conventional technology. A blockchain is an incredible piece of architecture in that it's easily verified that it hasn't been tampered with, and more importantly we have good solutions to testing that code for managing a blockchain will not break existing consensus rules. Not perfect, forks do happen, but good.
I would imagine private blockchains will support operations that will make your hair curl, such as freezing assets, diluting assets, etc. based on centrally held keys, but the difference is that there will be a verifiable chain of events showing how current state was agreed on. It's a tool for solving the case where records disagree.

Everything in Bitcoin is going to be little steps for a while, as it grows. A Bitcoin debit card is great if you're paid in Bitcoin, because to buy food you now go to the shop and buy food. For anyone doing international consulting, suddenly Bitcoin is cheaper and easier for receiving payments, so that will push demand for Bitcoin for wages. As more people have Bitcoin, it pushes demand for taking Bitcoin natively, which makes this card less required, but that's fine, it's an interim step.

It's a fairly poor settlement layer, given 3 transactions per second puts it on par with the existing CHIPS interbank clearance network (I've lost their statistics page), which is just one US-only option. Bitcoin is not a functional global settlement system at 3 transactions per second.

Or Sybil attacks. This is a risk analysis tool, which is fine on small amounts, but if you can isolate/control a node's connections (MITM attack, simply flooding the network with botnet nodes, whatever) you can make it think any transaction has relayed successfully, when no such thing has happened. Until it's in a block, nothing is guaranteed. Worse, you need a few blocks after that to make sure your first block can't be orphaned.
This is especially true in an environment where transaction quantity exceeds available block space, as there's certainly no guarantee that just because a transaction has relayed, that it will be mined.

I'm a lot more comfortable that if I have three servers in three countries with keys stored on a hardware security module, and each signs a block in turn, that that's a hell of a lot harder to break and a lot easier to test than anything else I can readily come up with.
Last idea being bounced around (and this isn't in a bank situation I should add) was archival-quality CDs being stored in multiple locations, with cryptographic signatures for the files on disk. Essentially a blockchain just automates the replication step and gives you a guarantee that you'll know if the data on disk is corrupted.

In your first example, taking the most extreme 6 months (May-Nov), the price jumped 26%. In the second, the change is 13%.
In 3 months, Bitcoin went 1000% up, followed by 1000% down. It's dropped 50% in the last few weeks alone (is there any good source of Bitcoin trade data, BTW? I'm having to go by memory here...)
To answer your initial question, about 25%/year would normally considered a high, worrying level of volatility.


The price relative to Bitcoin is not the important part, (I could simply quote you for 1/20th of the quantity of wheat and suddenly it would be the same), it's about the change. Bitcoin went up past $20/BTC and has dropped to in the region of $2/BTC.

I think the idea is that you can always require transactions have a sequence number too high for them to be replaced, and it's therefore a safe change. I think the main confusion was that Peter was for a while pushing for RBF on any unconfirmed transaction, and a lot of the arguments are against that.
Doubt I can get a client added to the main Bitcoin site (I can always ask), but I can arrange for it to be available and probably for Gitian signatures (so you're not just trusting me)

When I first heard about Bitcoin, my initial impression is that it was not going to be the crypto-currency that succeeded, but the one where we found out the problems. I did briefly do a full 180-degree turn on that stance, but it didn't last...
If Bitcoin can be stabilised at $2 or $1 or whatever, brilliant, but at this point I'd more be taking what experiences we can take from this and thinking how to solve them for the next currency...
@_date: 2015-10-03 09:27:46
So... my test was primarily for whether the relay network held together, ArmedMilitia is talking about orphaned blocks. That's a different problem, as it's not about network stability, but miner motivation.
However, to address the concern raised, the BIP 66 fork in Bitcoin (the mess around July 4th) clearly shows miners are already doing SPV mining (i.e. getting the block header and mining it, rather than waiting on the full block). That's fixed at 80 bytes (it's a bit bigger for anything that supports AuxPoW, but we're still talking very small numbers of bytes), so it relays extremely quickly.
Combined with the [Bitcoin Relay Network]( it's difficult to see this being a realistic problem. If we had runaway growth (orders of magnitude more nodes) we might see relay times be an issue with very short blocktimes, but even if one minute is extreme (and it seems to work for us), I'd suggest there's a good compromise in there somewhere.
@_date: 2011-07-22 22:38:14


Yes there is. It's a currency. It's taxed like any other transaction in a currency. The fact that it's not backed by a government makes it easier to get away with doding the tax, and harder to calculate tax due, but that's it.
If someone sold items for Euros, in the US, do you think it wouldn't be taxed? Of course not. Same applies here.
Edit: If it's not a currency, it's okay, there's still rules for that in most countries.

The Bitcoin main chain is limited to 3-ish transactions per second, maybe a bit more if they're small (bytes, not amount) transactions, unless we hard-fork the coin. You can use transaction fees to prioritise different transactions, but bottom line you're not going to get more than 1MB of transactions in per block, and blocks are about every ten minutes, to there's no way you're sustaining over 1MB/10 minutes. You can layer stuff on top of that to add capacity (side chains, lightning network or otherwise), but they still need to be connected somehow.
Current demand on one US-only interbank clearance network (CHIPS) amounts to around 3 transactions per second. Basically, that usage could move to Bitcoin, but you'd have no room for expansion. If there's any intent to handle worldwide settlement, it would need a significant multiple of the current capacity to support the demand.
That make more sense?
@_date: 2015-10-04 10:27:22
Blocks can take under a second to produce, but statistically it's unlikely that a block will be found in any specific second. Also, yes, with 1 minute blocks it gets more likely, but having actually tried gathering data on orphan rates, worst case was 8%, but with a 10 minute coin (Titcoin) having an almost 5% orphan rate, it suggests there are other factors that are more important (such as number of miners, network connectivity of miners, time to validate block).
Miners have started SPV mining despite the drawbacks, on Bitcoin, as-is. Are you suggesting they didn't understand the risks/impact before doing so, and have now changed? I find that unlikely, personally, but we have virtually no way of telling unless something breaks again.
@_date: 2015-10-23 12:07:20


Much like worrying about the percentage of US notes that have traces of cocaine, that seems merely a regrettable truth, not something that should affect you.


So, depending who you ask, you have an issue either of lack of regulation, or inability to personally verify integrity of an exchange?
Do what everyone else does, sell over time. If you have genuinely huge amounts, you'd get below market rate if you try cashing out all at once anyway. Trickle them out 3-6 BTC/day into fiat. If an exchange decides to seize your funds, or implodes, or is cracked, you therefore only lose the coins you deposited that day.

Part of the problem is that it gets harder to modify Bitcoin over time. Essentially any hard-fork change means every single user must update, which as adoption increases, is more people. Further, as more implementations are added, there's a longer lag while they're also all updated and tested. So, if we later decide that 1MB isn't enough, it's going to be even more nightmarish to change.
If Bitcoin basically turns into a settlement layer with mediocre to poor performance because we're trying to push through too much data, I'm not really sure how that's useful. It may well continue to grow for now, but there's no technical constraint causing this (really, I've done the stress tests myself), it basically just invites being replaced by better technology later.
@_date: 2011-10-17 17:41:33
Price volatility seems to be the huge one; it gained then lost an order of magnitude in value over a 6 month period. That's a significant risk for any company that might otherwise think of accepting Bitcoin out of curiosity/as an early adopter. If I remember correctly, payments for mining are on a massively decreasing scale; I think early adopters got too much, in comparison to early but not that insanely early adopters, and that didn't help.
Released without enough technical backing too, IMHO. Bitcoin came out with no immediately available web tools, or mobile app, for payments. That meant those had to be developed frantically to try catching up, and I think if web &amp; mobile apps had come out at the same time it would be a different picture entirely.

Altcoin dev here - not in any way most people would consider. For example yes the Bitcoin Core devs have more lines of code in our own codebase than we do, but that's because it's a fork.

To add to that; I can't tell someone to upgrade. I can tell them we've convinced the major infrastructure parts to upgrade (miners, exchanges, etc.), and try to convince them to upgrade, but it's not a "You must upgrade", it's "Please upgrade so your stuff continues to work with everyone else who upgraded"
Bitcoin has several thousand active nodes at any time, which is likely the tip of the iceberg of installed nodes. So we're probably talking about convincing 10,000-100,000 individuals to make the decision to upgrade. Plus all the alternative clients/libraries (Bitcoin-Ruby/Toshi, python-bitcoinlib, bitcoinj) may require changes to update them, and then their users need to be convinced.
Hardforking a coin at this point in its lifecycle is woefully underestimated IMHO.

Sorry, to be clear, I had meant O(1) is a nice sweetener to get miners to not grumble about the move, rather than it's required to go in as part of a hard fork.
Don't think we did a postmortem, but good point, should write something down. Key highlights:
1. Some nodes with very large wallets took a very long time to shut down/start up (hours). I've presumed (but not tested to verify) this is a scaling issue with the built in accounting system. Producing an alternative is on my priority list, and for Bitcoin you'll at least have more technical expertise available, so should be less of an issue.
2. People will hate you for it, but building binaries for whatever esoteric platform they're using will make them hate you a lot less.
3. Keep audit logs of everything. Log when you announced the fork, note discussion. If you do communication to node operators (which for Bitcoin I'd imagine will be delegated, but I'd recommend is done), note when and how they were contacted. Basically cover yourself in case an exchange complains three months notice wasn't enough because their sysadmin was on holiday.
We actually had 3 people (including myself) working on a shared spreadsheet (Google Docs), so we could build up a list of those who needed contacting, note how they were contacted, when, if/when they acknowledged the contact, and if/when they acknowledged the upgrade. For high-priority services (payment processors, major exchanges, major merchants) we also repeatedly prodded them until they confirmed the upgrade, which probably didn't make us any friends with those who succeeded, but I know few were at or just after the last minute!

Hangon, actually, wasn't Lighthouse to solve the difficulties in arranging funding for smaller projects outside of core?
Still doesn't work if no-one pays, of course, just checking semantics.

Great - who's going to write that other crypto? Bitcoin is the best funded cryptocurrency, and still on a tiny fraction of the funding going to those using the software.
Yet so often any problem is pushed to the core devs to fix.

Generally we're busy with whatever pays the bills - that's not a complaint, we looked at funding models, it quickly becomes apparent we lose much of our identity if we move away from a volunteer model.

I hate to say this, but wouldn't (presuming a situation where it goes wrong, anyway) this be easier with Bitcoin?
I mean, sure, multisig could have helped, but if you're in a position where someone can send $50k of your money out based on an email only, I think it's reasonable to say defence in depth isn't happening.

There's a fairly good list of items (  ) that have been suggested. Each hard fork is disruptive, if any of those changes are clearly positive (and only if), then I think trying to get them in at the same time is positive.
Certainly I think most of those will never happen unless included in a hard fork which is occurring anyway.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:06:56
Additionally; cryptocurrency technology is, IMHO, currently unduly brittle. It's too easy to hard fork a coin by screwing up parameters in an update. If I was doing this again, I'd be very tempted to actually embed a lot of logic into the blockchain genesis block, using some variation on the scripting language used for transactions, and implementations simply have to be proven to execute scripts correctly, and any changes to protocol are broadcast through the blockchain rather than as wallet changes.
@_date: 2015-02-09 17:05:24
So transactions would include a merkle branch (and presumably a block reference to indicate which tree it's part of), and can then be verified from that block onwards without requiring the predecessors.
Certainly sounds like a good idea to me!

What's the situation with BIP62 BTW? As an initial question, what actually meant it wasn't feasible at the moment (I've guessed it was the clean stack requirement, but seem to have missed part of the discussion)?
Are you expecting it to be back later, presumably with different block/transaction numbers?
Edit: For everyone else, BIP62 is transaction malleability fixes by adding significantly strictly constraints on transactions:

First practical implementation, but the theory was figured out a while ago. That it took over a year for anyone to make it work illustrates difficulty in doing so, it's certainly something I'm proud of, just cautious to keep claims clear. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:44:58
It sounds like they screwed up key generation or handling. Generated on an Internet-connected device (or worse, on cloud hosting), or printed over wireless, or not enough entropy in the random source, or  simply too many people had access to the keys.
Cold storage should be generated on a permanently offline system, and signing done on that system where needed, with signatures relayed by thumbdrive or similar.
@_date: 2015-02-26 00:06:53
The problem is, it seems no-one wants to pay for things they need, they want to pay for things that will make them money. Hence projects such as Bitsquare (creating decentralised exchanges that we so clearly need after the constant stream of imploding exchanges) struggle for funding, yet there's a constant stream of at altcoins getting money via ICOs based on little more than a dozen buzzwords on a nice looking website.
I don't really have answers to this. I contribute code to core as I have time, personally, but I'm not sure how to encourage others to donate time/money/whatever they can.
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:34:44
It's out, and projects are running on it, so... question is, is anyone funding stuff?
@_date: 2015-02-09 13:09:16
It is really depressing the way things are funded or not. People will throw money at ponzi scheme du jour in the hope of getting rich, but investment in actual infrastructure is negligible (see the GPG developer funding, or lack thereof, as an example).
This is currently depressing me a lot too:

If I told you your bank's entire IT infrastructure was run by a half-dozen full time people plus an on and off group of 100-ish randoms, how good would you expect the core to be to make it not spontaneously catch fire/implode?
That's why.
@_date: 2015-02-23 23:48:04
I'm an altcoin dev, and even I have to agree the space is awash with scams. I'd take more objection to the distraction assertion, in that altoins are (at least one hopes) trying something different (however minor that may be). Sidechains will make it easier to do technical experiments with Bitcoins, but they're not actually a workable technology yet (it's amazing how many people seem to forget that) and you can't do economic experiments with them (as in you can't create an inflationary sidechain that uses Bitcoins, for what I'd hope are reasonably obvious reasons).
@_date: 2015-02-03 11:08:42
It's CEO-heavy, as far as I can tell, but really that makes me just think I should arrange a technical/geek-heavy alternative if it bothers me. I can understand it's frustrating to feel left out, but I can also see the value in a meeting where you don't have to watch what you say as much.
There's plenty of open stuff, and a lot of Bitcoin/cryptocurrency people are not that difficult to track down at events and talk to if you want, this feels primarily like an opportunity for some to get together and unwind.
@_date: 2015-02-09 13:19:30
Okay, but we can wave block size numbers around all we like, it's going to take a hard fork to change. I've led the hard fork on a top-10 altcoin, and it was exhausting, with a fraction of the legacy infrastructure of Bitcoin. Also in the case of one exchange it turned out their sysadmin was on a multi-month vacation (!?!) and this happened: 
IMHO Bitcoin needs a higher block size limit, but we must not delude ourselves that this is easy or risk-free.
@_date: 2015-02-01 01:23:28
Can anyone give me an overview of the differences between it and  ?
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:31:40
It's definitely 0.10 everywhere I've seen it. Unfortunately difficult to go and retroactively renumber all the 0.x versions to 0.0x, but yes, probably they should have had two digits after the 0.
Nevermind eh?
Edit: To add to that, within the actual code it's stored as two separate numbers, major revision and minor, and the decimal point is just a separator for the two parts. Maybe we should start versioning as "0,10" or something
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:07:42
The biggest time sink is due diligence. We could blindly apply 1,200+ patches to the code and just fix the stuff that obviously breaks, but it would be somewhat reckless (not that that stops many developers, he says snarkily). Instead everything goes through at least one review before it's applied.
The other thing is, the actual number of changes for an altcoin is more than is apparent. For example we have subtle differences in fee calculations, and some of the Bitcoin Core 0.10 changes have complex consequences in that regards.
Definitely looking at automating the process more over time, and as we build up test cases it gets easier to apply code as-is as the risk is more controlled, but for now there's a lot of time sunk into testing.
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:02:41
What I had meant was you might see a change released, and as developers review the changes they can sign them to indicate their approval/rejection. This realistically models much of the current situation, where most people will trust domain experts as they are unable to verify these themselves (I'd love to hear ideas for making it easier to verify the rules, though).
I also will give up key if threatened, and people should presume is the case and act accordingly. Certainly it terrifies me every time someone suggests the reference client auto-updates. Significant care and attention is given to ensuring that I have nothing of significant value in this regard, and I dislike any theories that suggest otherwise :-D
My immediate priorities at the moment, beyond moving house and other tedious RL stuff, are better library support and writing a stand-alone replacement for the accounting system. Definitely if someone wants to look at coding blockchain parameters in a scripting language I'd be happy to provide guidance where I can, and may come back to it later on as time permits.
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:48:22
A lot of the more recent altcoins forked us (often without changing the alert keys - sometimes I wish I had less morals), so they're now 0.9 forks, or Blackcoin if they're PoS-based (Blackcoin I think was 0.8).
@_date: 2015-02-06 08:51:27
Sort of. So in our case, being an inflationary coin is part of our identity, and current sidechain technology doesn't have structures for coin issuance on the sidechain. It might be possible to have some sort of weird sliding exchange rate over time I suppose, but certainly it's not something I'd rush into.
There's also not a lot of motivation for existing coins to rebuild themselves as sidechains. It's likely to be a lot of work for little reward.
I think sidechains are definitely the way forward for a lot of innovation (as well as scalability), though, potentially enabling much more complex transactions without requiring the huge overheads involved in trying to modify Bitcoin Core (or other reference clients). One easy example being technology such as [Swapbill]( - I'm not at all convinced by the use of burn-based sidechains for that, however if they can move to pegged sidechains it solves a lot of technical issues.

Also, that software stack they're so proud of? Looks like a lightweight (okay, that's not to be sneered at) version of [grid services](
We tried this back in 2002, it ended poorly, but the open source equivalents are all out there still.
@_date: 2015-02-27 16:13:35
I think he's right, and previous misuse of terms isn't a good reason to continue down this path IMHO. Also, while the Gentoo package changes have been repeatedly rejected, I'd be interested to see what other technical people reckon before we call a majority opinion here.

Really most credit has to go to Ben on that one. Ryan managed to set half the leadership against each other, layered on complex stories for why anything went awry, Ben actually stayed focused throughout.
The whole mess is also a serious lesson in what government regulations cover - it ensures you can find out what went wrong, not stop it going wrong. Moopay was registered against Alex Green with no indication of any name change, and somehow they even got at least partial MSB licensing in the US. We put far too much faith in both. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 10:58:39
What I think we need to say to people more is; the value will go up only if it's more useful/usable. A lot of people were sold the idea Bitcoin is like a company, that in "buying in" you're investing and supporting ongoing work. If you're contributing to the Bitcoin Foundation, projects on Lighthouse or other development groups, then you're supporting ongoing work. Otherwise, not so much.
That's important because I think the expectation / work achieved gap is a lot of what left the price unsupported.
@_date: 2015-10-03 09:44:51
Speed of light's only really an issue if we're trying sub-second block times. Looking at the circumference of the earth (40,075,000m) and speed of light (300,000,000m/s), it should be fairly clear we can loop data around the earth in well under a second. Network routing delays do slow that, sure, but it's not really a problem unless we want to add Mars into the relay network.
I know what you mean about SPV mining, but can you really see any way it doesn't make more sense for miners to use it? If someone comes up with a technical solution to it, maybe that will change, but right now I see it as an inevitability.
@_date: 2015-02-23 23:51:59


One obvious example would be the choice of the secp256k1 curve for the EC signatures. I'll freely admit I don't know enough elliptic curve cryptography to fully understand, but I've talked to people who do and raise it as a concern. Most coins use the same curve (heck, fairly certain 90+% of altcoin devs have no idea what secp256k1 is), but some do not (Stellar being the highest profile example I'm aware of). If that curve is cracked, it's one way in which Bitcoin's failure could be from its design and not inherent to all altcoins.
(There's a related contingency plan for Bitcoin of course, for anyone curious:  )
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:41:00
It's also really important to emphasise how much subtle, non-sexy but important stuff like this goes on in the Bitcoin Core code. I'm an altcoin dev, so the last person to believe in a Bitcoin-only future, but _far_ too many altcoins disregard the changes happening in Bitcoin in preference to throwing random features into their reference wallets.
For me, at least, it will be really interesting in 6 months time to see which coins are up to speed with Bitcoin Core 0.10 and which are stuck on 0.8/0.9 (we still semi-regularly get "issues" opened on Github by people who are used to the Bitcoin 0.8 style build environment and think our use of the revised process from 0.9 is a bug).
@_date: 2015-02-09 13:23:37
I swear, if I facepalm much more, I'm going to have my hand stuck to my face like a non-facehugger.
WTB better metaphor.
@_date: 2015-02-06 09:21:38
The design also has huge issues with trust, in that either you let anyone push suggested updates into the chain and the clients then prompt the user to enable/reject (erk), or you have signed updates by central developers (which is clearly going nowhere).
I'd definitely want to put the logic and parameters into the genesis block, I think that's a good idea, but perhaps the answer is any later updates are delivered separately in a blockchain-like entity. The model at the moment is essentially that changes are adopted by trust of developers, so potentially the most practical option is that the new rules are written, their hash embedded into a transaction in the main chain to provide permanence, and the actual changes provided as a signed block-like entity that the client appends to its details of what to use.
Mostly this is academic at the moment, as there'd need to be a lot more motivation for me to try doing a whole currency replacement.
Edit: Performance also likely to be nightmarish. We'd either have to have calls that do SHA256/Scrypt/whatever hashing, and signature verification (and risk that the underlying implementation has issues), or code _everything_ in the script language. Using existing well-established VMs (Java/.Net) could help there potentially, but then brings in other issues.
Edit 2: That said, the code is very static, so actually it should be possible to pre-compile it from what's in the blockchain, rather than requiring anything fancier such as a JIT VM...

I should say, we're up to 0.9.3 and were around the first altcoin (I think we had the code done first, but Darkcoin beat us to binaries) with the OpenSSL 1.0.1k fix applied. However, yes, most of the forks were around 0.9/0.9.1
Edit: Yes, one day someone's going to care enough to take all the unfixed security issues in old altcoins and wreck havoc.
@_date: 2015-02-09 13:15:23
The price will go up if there's demand for Bitcoin. The problem we've had is posts like this one trying to artificially inflate the price before the value is there.
We need to stop running around telling each other it can only go up, and get on with actually making it more useful. Or usable, anyway.
@_date: 2015-02-09 13:39:40
It's also worth seeing what else needs a hard fork and can be thrown in at the same time. Seeing if we can add in sidechain support at the same time (I know it only requires a softfork, but if we're hardforking anyway, might as well do both at the same time), for example.
However, yes, I think we need a higher limit. I don't think jamming every transaction through the primary blockchain will ever scale, but I think the maximum block size will need to be higher than it is.
Anyone heard much about [O(1) block propagation]( recently?
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:28:54
Bitcoin Core 0.10 is a huge leap forward from 0.9 (especially in terms of software architecture under the hood), as well as a huge amount of work by the developers over the last year. Seriously great stuff.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:34:31
Absolutely. It gets easier with time to merge changes (for 0.9 it was easier to throw the whole thing out and start again - there's still disagreement over whether it wasn't going to be simpler for 0.10 too).
There's also no motivation for the Bitcoin devs to make it easier to adapt (nor should there be). Work that's ongoing anyway does have this result as a side-effect, but that's a different matter.
I would absolutely recommend to anyone thinking of starting a coin, to do it from scratch. If you don't have enough you want to  change to make it worth doing, your idea's almost certainly somewhere in the hundreds/thousands of coins launched last year.
Edit: Missing word
@_date: 2015-02-22 20:13:04
So, there's an idea called proof of burn wherein you send coins to an unrecoverable address, essentially destroying (burning) them, and a corresponding number of coins are generated on another blockchain and given to you. The most immediate example being Counterparty 
The downside to this approach is that you can't get the coins back on the original blockchain, because they're fundamentally unrecoverable. Newer sidechain technology allows these coins to be locked while they're on the sidechain, and later unlocked by removing them from the sidechain, so the coins can be recovered.
@_date: 2015-02-06 12:10:43
There's a Bitcoin developer mailing list which is highly active. I'm on a train, so difficult to link, try Googling "Bitcoin development mailing list", should come up near the top.

Heck, 1MB isn't enough for a global backbone. 20MB may or may not be enough, but it's a lot closer.
Bitcoin main network is going to become a backbone, IMHO. Whether traffic moves to third parties, side chains, or something else I don't know, but I can't see a single thread of transactions scaling sufficiently over time.
Hard forking Bitcoin is terrible, and hard, and risky. Not forking it is even worse, IMHO.

The testnet is not by any means a perfect representation of mainnet. I recently, for example, had problems with it relaying non-final transactions, and after much to-ing and fro-ing, it turns out that's only on testnet.
It also lacks the transaction volume, plus the bizarre legacy/bespoke systems lurking on mainnet that no-one expects. In the case of transaction volume, that led to  only appearing after deployment to main.


I thought it was reasonably clear they meant "Once a release is made generally available", as any post-release issues are very hard to rollback (essentially a negotiation/information broadcast challenge).


Any _planned_ changes, yes. Unplanned changes such as OpenSSL 1.0.1k launching and changing what is considered a valid signature led to a mad scramble across a weekend to patch back to previous behaviour. Again, as illustrated by the maximum block size changing without being noticed in 2013, sometimes changes get through testing.
Edit: Mad scramble across those working in blockchain technology, but I should emphasise Bitcoin Core was well ahead of everyone else.
@_date: 2015-02-13 20:32:08

You... guys do realise that large price movements are essentially exactly not what you want in a currency, right?
I mean... imagine you're a company that sells products in BTC but pays its bills in USD. Yes, you may have got lucky and you were holding BTC when it sky-rocketed, but essentially you're a currency trader if you're doing that. What you are going to have to do is re-price your entire catalogue to bring it back to reasonable levels, and hope BTC doesn't swing violently the other way and suddenly you're not making enough to cover bills.
Seriously, this stuff makes people nervous.

There was a Bitcoin stall at CES which started the process, and then a few Bitcoin companies decided to make large individual purchases. Personally I'm expecting a reversion to the $13-14 window that it was happily existing in, but we'll see.
