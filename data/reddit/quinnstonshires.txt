My grand parents used farthings and shillings in the 60s, so this makes the pound is only 60 years old?

I remember going as a boy and being a millionaire with 15 quid in Lira. A few years later and they changed the amount of zeros, then abandoned next time I went lol. so they've had their currency issues for while. It's a popular holiday destination and everybody exchanges to Euro to go.

The price changed by 300 dollars in 10 minutes, but the price ended up the same as it was 10 minutes before. It's called manipulation and it's a little different to the Bart we're use to.

The fact is, the last bitcoin will never be mined. In 2140 the reward will be arbitrary close to zero, but the last bitcoin will never ever be mined.

It will never be mined. If you keep halving something (block reward) it just gets really small and never actually reaches zero.

Bitcoin is going to a bear market. Don't buy bitcoin now you'll be able to pick more up later for cheaper. Stay out or short it!
