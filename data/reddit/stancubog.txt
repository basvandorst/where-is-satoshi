They might not know anything about altcoins, but maybe they know marketing. The problem is that people would actually mine to those coins. From there, an exchange website for this coin is easy. You convince a few people to buy your crap with BTC, and then you disappear. Now, who would be persuaded by a simple website to give BTC for some crap? People that don't know anything about altcoins. Those will go out in the world and cry that the bitcoin is a scam.

Really nice! I see that you make several transactions per minute. do you have a strategy? I guess you do, and maybe you don't want to share it, but at least a few ideas? I will get the grip really fast, my mother says that I am really smart

This is not "freedom of markets", it is something else. Even in the free market, the quality of the product is given by the size of the investment and by labor force. If you have none, you have a Chinese bitcoin, or less than that.

and I found many other projects like this on freelancer, for less than $200. that is even scarier

just opened an account on cryptsy, but it is sooo confusing. so many cryptos there. just deposited 0.03 btc there and I have no clue what to do with it
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:44:34
do you trade on cryptsy?

yes, i found out about the bitcoin sometimes in 2010, when it was possible to mine it with CPU. I installed the miner, started to work, and asked myself: where is the money? I think I was stupid also, but this does not mean that it is still not a good place to make some money. I just don't know how yet
@_date: 2014-01-12 11:53:03
Yes, it worked with Appdata
@_date: 2014-02-15 18:17:42
is it good or bad?
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:34:48
Yes, but the reputation of IQ scams shades, just like the one of Bitcoin, because of that. Now, there is a problem. I know, you know. But many people don't, and they get attracted in those scams

If you could give me more details about doing that...
@_date: 2014-02-05 19:41:26
Thanks for the threads, they are really good, exactly what I was looking for.

Thanks for the exchanges, I already know those, I was looking more about strategies and ideas. I am wondering if it is possible to use Forex techniques to trade cryptos, but I guess cryptocurrencies are more volatile, so the usual moving average and gravestones don't work. I have some bitcoins (well, a small portion of one bitcoin) on btce, but I see that smaller currencies just get...smaller. I was looking for better ideas :)

Thanks for your answer, but I am a real noob. I don't know how to use the files from that link...
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:21:52
good idea. I will try that if nothing else works
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:27:13
I think your "childish" game would work a lot better, with two or three currencies appearing all the time, don t you think?
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:38:57
of course! now they need it
