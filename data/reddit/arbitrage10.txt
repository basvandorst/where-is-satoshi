And now Peter Todd wants increase the BTC supply and no one says a thing...

If Bitcoin’s inflation schedule can be changed by devs, the devs are really no different than a central bank, and we are back to square one. Centralized control. It is not an option.

No, that is a myth. 
Bitcoin is set in stone. Satoshi defined how it works. If you don’t like his invention, create a new coin.

You are not a Bitcoiner. A bitcoiner would NEVER advocate for increasing the 21M coin limit. That is the  advantage of bitcoin over fiat. 
Bitcoiners have lost the way and it is really disappointing to see.

Thanks for the response. My question was more about the benefits of LN that you can’t get on any other coin. For example, it is possible to buy pizzas with other coins so that isn’t unique to LN.

What a great summary! Excellent, thank you.

Nice, thanks

Imagine if central banks decide they need to start buying bitcoin.. 10% could be very realistic in the long term. Especially whenever the next financial crisis hits.

Why do I care about making an electrical contact with Bitcoin..?
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:50:52
I think so. What is the point of them holding gold? The answer to that question is the same answer for why they would hold bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:47:36
Definitely. Except I wouldn't be spending my bitcoin right now unless I bought them really cheap. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:26:40
Central banks own a TON of gold though.

This is a good, subtle point. I wouldn't say there is no such thing as intrinsic value though. Food has calories which are needed for survival. Seems like food has intrinsic value to me. 
If the only way to acquire food was through the exchange of bitcoin for food, then you could argue that bitcoin also has intrinsic value. 
In any case, this is a semantics argument, and doesn't do much for speculating on the possible future usd/ btc or btc/ gold exchange rate.
