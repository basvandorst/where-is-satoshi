My concern is that to a layman, downloading for example CoPay, seeing that it is not PIN protected (it makes this decision because the developers know that that PIN protection would be less secure than using your phone's built-in lock screen, and create a false sense of security - plus, if you needed to enter it every time you open your wallet, you would be entering it many more times than the "spending password" that it does include.
Nonetheless, to the layman, this seems insecure compared to a banking app, and no explanation of this apparent oversight is present.
Then there's the backup mnemonic - you're supposed to trust your money to this thing? You don't know anything about mathematics, certainly don't trust mathematics or cryptography, you're just some guy who's always hearing about clever hackers breaking into banks and all sorts, wondering if you should trust a bitcoin wallet to keep your money safe.
I wish I was an animator myself, who could come up with a story line, use persuasive writing and illustrate all this in an easy to digest form.
In leiu of such a video, the more people who write out their best explanation here (don't worry if you think yours is not "as good" as the others, others will take what they do from individual comments, and the sum of parts will be a more coherent whole). Different people will find different explanations "good" anyway. But the target audience is the mainstream, not our community. And this is important - people are being asked to trust a lot of money to these answers, I suspect many people, in leiu of a very good understanding of why they should do that, give up and move on.
