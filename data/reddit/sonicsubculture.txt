I say this completely objectively - I would be interested in reading any citations you can offer for your claims.

This seems like FUD... you don’t pick who you buy or sell from on an exchange like GDAX... and one of the parties is always a taker, so you pay a significant fee.  Can somebody smarter than me please clarify this point?  Wouldn’t they basically need to trigger a flash crash by tripping everybody’s stop losses with a big market sell?  And wouldn’t all the strong hands just buy the dip?

It’s always in the last place you look!

I bought the dip, who got the chips?

You can transfer from coinbase to GDAX for free because it’s off-chain and they share a common back-end, but if you take it outside of that you have to pay the tx fee to get your tx included in a block, and lately there’s been a backlog round 200,000 txs so the fee is high.
E: but you do avoid any additional fees from coinbase!

If you look at the negative space, it looks like a cartoon fish jumping out of water.

I’ve been wanting to do this for a few weeks... thanks for sharing!  Any plans to retail?

If you go with Coinbase, be sure to learn about GDAX and maker/taker pricing as well as different order types ASAP.

Looks to me like you were right on the money with them confirming it will be considered virtual property today.
