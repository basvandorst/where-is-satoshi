Possibly stupid question but why wouldn't you go to university in a country where you don't have to go that much into debt?

Don't you think it will do a giant dip in oktober/november at the SW2X HF?

RemindMe! 16 days "What happened to the drive with all the BTC"

Wiping doesn't mean it's lost
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:27:44
huh? BTC dropped before aug 1. and then it rose. Thats what i was referring to
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:02:03
Exactly. Thats why you buy the dip, not wait after lol

No way will he be able to retire because of 3 Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:26:19
How much would you say you'd need to retire if you are, let's say, 30 years old. 2 Million? 3 Million if you don't want to pay attention to every penny you spend? A Million for a Bitcoin is too much imho.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:54:51
I accept that.
Kinda unrelated: what do you think of Ethereum?
@_date: 2017-09-11 00:43:45
no. Btc will keep rising. Its just less likely to dip like it did pre Aug 1

I also like it the way it is. Theres not much to discuss, besides the final scalability solution or news

No Segwit 2x = no hardfork = more stable price, propably

Yes he is involved in politics but I don't see how that weakens his projects
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:41:23
Yeah true, but there will be some time left before that is the case.
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:50:46

If you hold longterm: Hardware wallet
If you want to trade: Exchange/Software Wallet
If you want to know for Aug 1. : Anything but Exchange
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:23:59
As long as you own the private key of your wallet, everything is fine.
