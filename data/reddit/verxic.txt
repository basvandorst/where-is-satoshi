I really, really, really, really hope that is the case. I really do.
I need this fucking money, I have used blockchain for years through different wallets. It is just crazy, I've never seen anything like this happen to such a big website. They need to up their ante with their security.

Don't have to be a smart ass about it, but thanks.

Has anyone received a reimbursement by blockchain for this happening yet? Anyone at all?

In the case it wasn't the user that failed to secure his wallet, it was blockchain.
Do you even read?

Thanks, I lost my fucking car savings. 
So, I guess I'm part of this fucking .0002%

I am simply stating to the public about what happen and the process I am going through to get my BTC and I am going to keep them informed.
This will allow people to know if they should use Blockchain.info again or not.

lmao thanks man. I swear I knew something bad was gonna happen with these coins I was really debating sending it over to my coinbase account. But I am a really impatient person and hate the amount of time it takes to send transactions etc. so I didn't and now I regret it...

You don't read, there is no "he" here you idiot.
It's me, so the correct term would be "you", but I am the idiot? lol

Just because I got lucky and made this in a day doesn't mean I don't deserve a reimbursement what the fuck. Your logic is fucking irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-12-09 02:23:15
Well let's make a case if we do not receive are money...
I know $650 isn't as much as $40,000 but I am going to do it if I do not receive a reimbursement. I think you should too. And support takes way too fucking long to review this information. This is bullshit, this is top priority I expect a reply within an hour at least. Unless their team is as shitty as their security.
@_date: 2014-12-09 20:55:43
Got a response. let's hope for the best.
My BTC were sent to his wallet, so I should be receiving a refund if all goes well.
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:43:55
I'm fucking sad guys... lol
This is really fucking making me depressed it sucks ass.
