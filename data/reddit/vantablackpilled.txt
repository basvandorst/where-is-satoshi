That capitulation will be a nice time to get cheap coinz

Bcash =/= BTC but they are clones no?  If I send BCH to BTC address and vice versa it can be reversed right?

Literally a spreadsheet of hypotheticals. Why not a spread sheet of current reality ��

Thanks for increasing the value of everyone else's coins.

If you don't the same way then GTFO

Who fucking cares. We are here to make money.

You have a low IQ and it shows

I'm in nano for the tech I'm in BTC for the lambos

You better be sure because if ATH isn't reached by this time next year I'm out!

Real volume is dying.
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:53:18
So why am I still red
@_date: 2019-04-02 03:31:33
Yeah. I like the perspective where he didn't show this is the longest bear market ever with volume dying everyday.
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:24:50
More real men are being red pilled now than you think. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:01:06
You are clearly a USD shill it's not even funny.

"Redditor for 4 days". Yes I'm sure you have something constructive to contribute that is not FUD.
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:50:19
SFYL. Hopefully a lesson was learned here. The sooner you let the lose go the sooner you can start accumulating more BTC.

As a fiat holder what do you think is a better metric. USD valued compared past USD value, and current currencies, or commodities. That's why purchasing power parity is a superior metric than GDP
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:25:11
Lol so you think the market just freezes because they are closed. If the US government blewup you're gonna think the dollar has value until Monday when the market opens 
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:07:20
It's literally impossible for it to be zero
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:23:39
I'm not gonna write an essay but what I'm saying is not wrong. The official term is that the Federal reserve "regulates" the dollar but that really just means manipulation. The most recent example is the interest rate hike. I'm no Trump fan but the increased rates where long overdue. Why during his presidency and not Obama. Or how about the national debt. It's all meaningless as the money can just be printed at will. The forced inflation is to force people to give their hard earned money away.

So money is being released later? Thanks

Even my capital one card has an app that gives me a new CC number whenever I want if I'm on a sketchy site or sign up for free trials. The number is deleted after the transaction.

Let's get the ball rolling so I can get my money back ��

Says who? BTC value is measured in value by commodities not USD price. No matter how much imaginary USD it takes to buy 1m Satoshi, 1m Satoshi can buy me a months worth of groceries.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:53:48
How is it idiotic. The entire creation of the Fed was to manipulate the dollar at the government and 1%'s will.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:13:39
Get your shitcoin the fuck out of here.
