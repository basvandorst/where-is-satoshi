I'm guessing they don't know how simple exchanges are. They know banks don't trade it, so it seems like you'd have to manually find a buyer to exchange it to fiat.

Extremely likely long term growth and somewhat likely smaller drop in the near future. So if you sell now and want to buy back monday, but find that there was no drop or that you missed it, you lost money you didn't have to lose. Doing nothing is near guaranteed earnings, trying to time your sale/buy to game the curve is not.

Capital gains. Same as if you were buying/selling any other currency.

"A bitcoin is too expensive now. It's too late to get in."
"You can just buy a fraction of a bitcoin. It doesn't have to be whole."
"But if you buy a fraction of a bitcoin, who owns the rest of the Bitcoin though?"
"If you have 25 cents then who owns the rest of your dollar?"

The ultimate hodler is the one who completely forgets he has it without also losing it.

In the above example of the buyback, earnings would be the difference in value gained (or lost) from the buy. What you sold for minus what you bought back for, the remainder would be your earnings. 
The loss from short term drops in what you own is only potential loss and will be realised only if you sell at that price. If you feel confident that Bitcoin will return to the same or higher price later, you can disregard that drop entirely. It only matters if you might find yourself needing to liquidate it in a hurry.
I should say that I'm not a broker, so this is just my layman's understanding. I might be muddying up the terms.

It's a meme mocking EA's microtransaction policy. We want to give the player a sense of pride and accomplishment = give us all them sweet, sweet monies

That's a self-fulfilling prophecy. If everyone buys and holds to sell later, it will become a speculative bubble. Nothing more.

You can spend Bitcoin and still hodl. IMO Hodl is a warning against panicking and cashing out by selling your Bitcoin for fiat.

It is indeed. AFAIK the best way to prevent that scenario is encouraging widespread adoption by spending Bitcoin.

What's the point of bitcoin if nobody spends it? Hell, what's the point of money at all then?
If you follow your logic, literally everything you buy for any currency is a terrible choice because you could have put that value in bitcoin and hoarded it.

I agree. It's a must if Bitcoin is to stick around as something other than an esoteric way to transfer money without a bank. I'm not coding savvy enough to know how hard that is, but it seems like a given that we need to sort it out.

Everything about it is amazing, but I'm mostly curious about how the fuck he managed to communicate this to the people at the bottom.

Retro memes are always a solid investment. Buy at bargain price and wait for the ironic vintage meme boom. 
But yeah, it's actually kind of hilarious that a joke coin is outliving a bunch of dead serious alts.

Isn't this the core of the concerns raised? That it seems to favor the interests of the companies, not the users?
