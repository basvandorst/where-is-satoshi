Well I think it used to be slow, but now it's takes few minutes only.
On localcoin you have to get out to meet up with someone, it also depends on his answering time

saw a post of this guy earlier "the upward curve has just commenced"
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:05:28
Last year everybody was talking about btc, it was all over the news, now nobody's talking about it. This curve totally reflects what I'm seeing.
Facts don't care about your feelings
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:25:16
Why would someone shame himself and make the effort to provide a proof? To make you feel better?
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:24:36
Good job

getting the money back matters more than calm
actually getting angry can sometimes help

What does this post mean?
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:57:31
Don't be rude, at least in your replies
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:28:18
how this is faster than coinbase or any other exchange?
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:03:05
Don't be so emotional, at least in your titles
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:32:56
But everybody is like the crow here

Guys, you should relax a bit, it's all just for fun :)
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:09:34
Many people actually really believed so

How are you conviced this bottom yet?
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:39:54
But if I look at 2016, it was at $400-500

As a general rule you can tell about a post just by the votes: if it's negative it's crypto-skeptical, if it's positive it's upvoted. Works 100%
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:27:22
Man, chill down :)
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:16:42
Man don't expect your sarcastic memes to be upvoted, people here hate them with a passion and will bury them as hard as they can

I'll check lightning and btcpayserver
So now he's in company be B, I'm in company C. But when we were in company A, we had apps to:
* Manage bills of expenses / expense accounts
* Manage corporate budgets (by departement / or projects / or directors)
* Manage workflow of validation processes for corporate investments
* Manage property portfolio of the group
@_date: 2018-12-21 13:21:48
why not?
@_date: 2018-12-23 10:45:03
For sure yes, but I have no plans to work with him again.
I told him he overvalues my knowledge since I was just holding BTC and a couple of alts lol, but he insisted.
@_date: 2018-12-23 11:03:10
I suppose he's not high enough in the hierarchy to care about that
@_date: 2018-12-23 10:51:54


Yes, that's pretty much it. The thing is that I'm not part of this organisation and I don't know which use cases he has. I can only assume it's the ones we had 3 years ago when we were working in the same company (we both quit to different companies)
@_date: 2018-12-23 10:57:52
Energy industry. Shared data and reconciliation issues, yes. Transaction accross different currencies, for sure yes.
But we talked very little at this point, I don't know his specific use cases. I have even infered my answers from my previous work, where we were working together.
Are there some generic solutions based on blockchain technology (or not) designed for big companies, which I can start to search in?
What's your consulting company?
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:58:48
Or maybe english isn't my mothertongue?
How many languages do you speak fluently? For sure not french as your name sounds ridiculous in that language.
I can sense some nervosity out there, people have lost too much money I guess
