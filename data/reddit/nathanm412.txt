Those tags aren't automatic. It's easier to moderate a smaller subreddit.

This would cause the need for exchanges. It would devolve into what we have now, unfortunately.

Following the blockchain, it appears that you definatley weren't the only one. Your coins were transferred through several addresses that merge into one with ฿4000.
Obviously, there is no way to know if this is owned by the scammer, or if this is some MTGox address, so take it for what it's worth. A lot of those transactions happened within a short amount of time. It looks like he let watched many people's wallets and decided to hit them all at once.

So far, you've cashed out $65,900 after an investment of $10,000 in a relatively short amount of time. That sounds like a pretty good deal to me. Besides, you still have ~$28,000 still in there. If you wait until BTC is worth $171, you can cash out knowing that you made $100,000 from just $10,000. If it doesn't happen, you've already guaranteed that you've made your money back. Nobody should expect that kind of return in an investment.

I'm sorry that nobody seems to be able to answer (or apparently understand) your question. I did a little bit of digging and found some information. I think the 0.7 limit was 250KB. I found a block on [blockchain.info]( that was mined a little over an hour ago with a block size of [398KB]( and even more recently, another with 462KB. So, if I'm reading this right, we've already passed the fork without incident!

That's extremely heartbreaking to read.

Our grocery store had one of those old style [manual imprint machines]( to be used during power outages. We'd ask for cash or check, but had no problems completing the transaction if they didn't have it. We'd also get their phone number in case there was a problem. The last outage I experienced resulted in 300+ manually imprinted transactions over a period of four hours. Not a single one failed to clear after the power came back on.

At the self checkout at my grocery store, there is a paypal button on the screen. If I wanted to, I could absolutely pay for my groceries with PayPal.

I'm in the same boat. I'd love to buy in during the crash, but I'm looking at more than 10 days to verify my account.

I'd never ship anything to someone on Craigslist, but dealing with them personally has always worked out well for me. I sold an old TV just last night. They came with cash and left with a TV. I wasn't home alone and he didn't come alone. I would have been willing to plug it in if asked to show that it was working.
I did purchase a car on craigslist a few years ago. I had to filter through a few obvious scams. Some people couldn't provide me with a photo showing they had the title with a matching VIN Others wanted to handle money before exchanging the car. But I found a listing from someone who at least seemed reputable. It was an old Civic for $500. My brother drove me to the title office to meet him. I started the car and drove around the parking lot and verified that the VIN# matched the one he sent me to do a carfax on. We both walked to the title office, exchanged money, and had the deed transfer notarized. He left with $500 and I left with a car.
