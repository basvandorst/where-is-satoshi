[Check this out]( ... 
using the Python "bubble" chart that was posted here last week, you can see the volume numbers here are **astronomical**.  It just doesn't add up...
EDIT: Updated above chart, plus most recent one is [here](

I just watched the price go from 28 down to 14 back up to 16 in 20 minutes.....volatility rules the day!  We need straddle/strangle options in MtGox, stat.  ;-)

Details, details...

Give them a few TXID's linked to the wallet you use to deposit/withdraw and it'll be pretty damn clear that you are who you say you are.

How's that for a quick buck?  I'm tempted to write a volatility bot.

Way to avoid the catastrophic loss of that one entire bitcoin... ;-)

True that.  After this little market correction, it seems it will always be kind of volatile...but it seems timing will matter somewhat.  So I'll just keep on mining, cash out periodically when the price looks good, and hey.  Maybe even try and, you know, buy things with these.  Turns out you can trade them for Amazon cards.... useful, no?  :-D

So i just entered a buy order at 2/3 the price of my average cost basis, and a sell order at 4/3 that price... can't lose.  No way. ;-D
@_date: 2011-06-11 23:43:20
...at which point buy asap  :P

THIS.  Require a 1 BTC deposit at beginning of the torrent and charge it if the d/l ends up leeching before 100% seed ratio.  Otherwise release funds back to the user.
