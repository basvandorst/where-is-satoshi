I think we should be using a bit of oppression.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:04:12
Say there are 3 people : Alice, Bob and Chris.
Alice and bob have made a bitcoin channel.
Bob and Chris have made a litecoin channel.
Chris wants to send roughly 1LTC of value to Alice, so he makes a channel transaction to send 1LTC to Bob on the condition he releases a special key.
Bob knows about this transaction so creates a transaction to send 1LTCs worth of BTC to Alice with his channel on condition that the special key is released.
Chris now knows he can release the special key and Alice will gain 1LTCs worth of BTC and he will lose 1LTC.
Alice doesn't now have 1LTC she has a fraction of BTC that at the time of transaction was worth 1LTC.
So to answer your question, it depends on the market value between the coins.

Also did a source code analysis before hand to find anything fishy.
Got a ~30% increase in BTC. Turns out I had spent some after the fork, so I had slightly more bitcash than bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-12-06 16:35:05


If this statement is true (And I believe it is) then surely we could write a program that detects 'aggressive' blocks that ignore valid transactions with adequate fees.
Also from another angle, would it be possible to allow a pool miner to add a limited number of their own transactions before checking for solutions, the centralized pool operator might have that hashing power, but they would no longer be able to freeze transactions, and any that try to ignore the solution will be provably ignorant of certain types of transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-13 20:15:39

I had an idea, where you have every node calculate the amount of coins it cost to live (food, shelter, medical) for 1 year and use that to come to a consensus.
Then each block mined will have a reward that pushes the price (by introducing more or less) until that 1 year is equal to one coin.
If food prices go up, so does your wealth.
Maybe this can be a side-chain to bitcoin?

Closed Source and Bitcoin doesn't mix well.
All it takes is for someone to add a small bit of code that pulls private keys and 'bam' a millions of people's cash could be gone from under their noses.
They could do all sorts of sneaky things like monitor when you get bored of your app and haven't used it in a week.
If this does happen, it would be near impossible to trace it back.
In open source,  all source is published and a history of changes is kept. Any ip-addresses in the code will show up red flags almost straight away.
And because of how things like git work, you can prove who did it.
And this is *before* code gets to release.

Theatres would continue to show movies.
I don't know how much studios make from the theatres, but the revenue form the cinema could be a very good indicator of how much they should ask for.
I agree with what you are saying though, the Movie could take time to become a hit.
It is more suited to Series than full length movies, so they make 20-30 minutes episodes and release one at a time as goals are met. They also have a chance to adjust the goals.
Another thing, there are multiple other revenue streams they could still use as normal including theatres, DVDs, streaming licences (netflix) and merchandise.
The only real difference really is p2p would be legal. Anyone wanting to make a profit from it would need licences still.
Can it be done? I have yet to see someone make a serious attempt at it yet. So I don't see it as an impossibility.

Could you not just add a transaction which is simply the block hash of the side chains block, into bitcoins block?
This way you don't do any mining on the side chain, but normal miners include the hash because they pick up the reward on the other chain.(Also
 no chain bloat)
Only downside is if no valid hash is added.

When people talk about freedom with bitcoin, what they really mean is distributed freedom.
With bitcoin, one person doesn't have any less than another.
Or even more accurately : with bitcoin nobody is forced into having less freedom than someone else. (Because people are free to loose their own freedom)

It sounds like English is your second language so I will try my best to repeat  my own words what you are saying.
When you create a transaction, you will add a little more that specifies which the addresses of the miners you want to mine the block. It includes an additional reward.
It would require that bitcoins algorithm for determining a valid transaction would be changed so that the address the reward is sent to would have to match at least one address from the transaction, to get the bonus, otherwise the bonus will just go to the change wallet.
The issue I see with this is it will increase the transaction size as you will be filling it with long lists of miners.

Through a concept called proof of burn, it is possible to migrate from one currency to another by destroying it in one block chain which then gives you the ability to create it in another.
If this works, bit coin could be rewrittain from the ground up and the whole block chain could be migrated without causing damage to the value.

Sorry if I didn't explain it to well.
The issue with different OS's is about the companies software not being supported, so you might make the wrong choice. Other than that it is a pain to manage so many devices because it is the tech guys job to uphold security.
I don't know what your occupation is, but as a software developer I see a lot of problems on businesses with the security around implementations. It takes one device in a company to have access to customer data ready to sell. If a personal laptop is used an it is compromised, then the data will quickly get swiped( things like email addresses and phone numbers)

Are you on windows? Because you have the high-risk of malware if you are. I have seen even simple tricks like software that detects that your clipboard has an address and replaces it with theirs, be sure to double check.

Value is always relative.
For example : A pizza is worth $12
However, things happen, suddenly lots more people want to but pizza, but there are only so many being produced and so the value of the pizza goes up.
It's all what people are willing to pay for, if nobody wants pizzas you can be sure that the price of pizzas would drop.
Same with bitcoin, there is a limited supply and more people are buying them. If you know people are to buying them, you can increase your prices.
Things that cause the price to go up :
 - People loosing/burning bitcoin.
 - People buying into bitcoin.
Things that make it go down :
 - The New coins being brought into circulation from mining.
 - People selling their coins for dollars.

The only real difficulty is advertising it in a way that funds are raised in a short space of time.

Cloud mining is a scam.
They don't contribute to the mining pool distribution.
They are probably not mining at all, and just pretending.
All they have to do is :
1. Ask for $10
2. Pay you Tiny amounts over time, getting less and less in a way that they never pay you back the original $10
3. Keep the remaining for themselves.
1. Ask for $10
2. Start giving you small amounts.
3. Wait for next sucker to pay into it.
4. Give their money to you so you end up profiting.
5. Take a cut.

It was more about when people perform hacks or scam people into handing over bitcoin that I was thinking about. I think other crimes like murder it wouldn't be useful I agree with you there. Although, maybe they were a chicken and hired a hitman, at that point they could leave lots of evidence in the blockchain.
I missed out quite a few things which, even in a Crypto-anarchy would still be around like a functional emergency trio. What I had in mind was a blockchain ascociated tax on expensive but static possessions. (Like land for example, and everything on it.)
People that have land would then need to make use out of it, for example solar farms.
With open source hardware, buying land and choosing a place to put things could be as simple as building in simcity.
The thing I worry about is that people who don't have the creative skills to make money in the future, are going to end up in a horrible pickle. Making tools they can enhance themselves with to better make decisions could level it out.

So it could be random data?
@_date: 2014-04-26 16:26:38
I had an idea for verifiers.
3 people are verifiers and 1 person is owner.
the 3 verifiers and owner make an address, but to spend from that address you need the signature from the owner and 2 verifiers.
verifiers can be anyone, and their job is to never sign an outgoing transaction twice.
If the owner wants to spend the coins he can sign it but must get signatures from 2 verifiers.
If the person accepting trusts the 2 verifiers then they can **instantly** accept the transaction.
If a verifier goes bad, then the most they can do is scam a small shop risking their entire business. (1 slip and nobody will trust them).
If nobody uses this method for more than small (&lt;$100) quick purchases in person, then there will be no intensive to break the system.

Because 2FA is for servers. The point of 2FA is if you have a virus on your computer then only 1 part can be found. The server asks the second device to verify by signing a piece of random data. 
The second is never touching the compromised computer and goes to the server.
The only way this could work is of you had a dedicated server at home with tight security.

Only if they explicitly give that app the keys to their bitcoin, they have no way of stealing from other wallets.

To expand on this... this could be implemented onto a blockchain where you can give someone 'land ownership' like bitcoin and while holding land you must pay a monthly fee into a DAC. That DAC then pays people like Police, Hospitals and Fire+Rescue.
If you don't pay the fee then it could give you a warning period (say 1 year) then remove you ownership of the land to be auctioned and sold, money going to the DAC again.
Of course, if you have more land, this means more tax, so people will only keep hold of things they can afford.
Other cool things could be done like assigning labels to land for postal services, land owned by the DAC (Think roads, parks, hospitals, etc) and even introduce complex things like building code, peer-voting to prevent people building a sky-scraper in the middle of a small village.

I think the 'communicating with air' might solve an issue with 3rd world countries using bitcoin.
Dumb phones can be programmed. If they can be programmed to communicate using sound, then they can be used to send public keys.

If you have 'sound spots' that give primitive internet connection for things like bitcoin then anyone could use it.

99.99999% of keyboards don't have that key.
Bitcoin addresses do not work like email addresses. You don't send data directly to the recipient, but the network of miners.
Also, if you have a device there is a good chance you have a qrcode scanner/NFC/bitcoin hyperlink all bring you to your wallet anyway.
Because of the risk of sending funds to the wrong address using aliases can be a very bad idea. If you want to send money to a friend, then ask for their address. I can imagine in the future adding an address to an email or similar will be simple like attaching a picture, with friendly icons.

Dear newcomers,
What I am about to tell you, could change your life either for the better or not at all.
Look at the block chain. Ask yourself, is this something that could change the way we think about finance, agreements, communication and government? Could this be the next stage to a better life?
If you answered no, then press Alt+F4 right now and forget about it.
If you answered yes, then look at your current savings and ask yourself : If I were to loose 10% of this, would it affect me?
If no, then spend the next week reading about the following subjects :
- blockchain (mining, proof of work, transactions)
- peer 2 peer (torrents, git)
- cryptography (public private keys/ hashing)
- FOSS (Linux, Gnu, GPL, git)
Don't feel like you need to understand it 100%, because even I don't. But get to a point where if any of these came up Gnu would git it.
Now you have absorbed this knowledge (feel free to expand) be sure to read the criticisms, then the counter arguments.
Now you are qualified to answer your own questions.
Of course feel free to ask any questions here, but if the question is should you invest that answer will be no.

This means you could make addresses with Netflix for every month for the next 5 years. If you ever want to spend the funds then you could, but Netflix will know and you won't get service that month.
Every month, Netflix could absorb the bitcoins.

5. To send someone some bitcoins enter their name and if it is a large amount then suck on it because they will probably limit you and question the large amount.
6. Although you can type names manually. There is a good chance you could have been in a discussion or similar. Use the discussions list of users and your set of saved contacts as a way of checking you typed it correctly.

If the universe is a computer in another universe. Anything in this universe could be changed by modifying the computer. If time and space itself is only a concept of our universe and the outer universe exists nearly in links between nodes, then a programmer in the outer universe has no location. Therefore he can have limitless interaction between any component of the computer. We would call that the admin. Christians would call that god. If you believe in the idea of multi verses (I think that's what they're called. Then in one universe there is a programmer who decided one day to create the concept of particles and waves and wrote a computer programming to simulate the reaction.
And this could be many layers deep. Maybe there are an infinite number of layers.
As easily as we can change the rules and memory of a computer, the admin could do the same to the universe.

This completely ignores the fact that transactions take time to spread through the network. You would need to do PoW hundreds of times or rely  on a third party to do it for you. But oh wait! You have removed this incentive so now everyone is screwed because there is no incentive to mine each others, requiring everyone to have a full node miner just to send 1 transaction.
@_date: 2014-12-20 11:33:53
AFAIK, only the transferal of coins from the side chain and back create transactions on the main block chain.
The incentive to keep coins on side chains would be high.
The only issue I understand of, is that individual chains are susceptible to 51% attacks. Which means if people move their coins across they don't have bitcoins security. One solution could be to prove a hash of the next block made it into the main chain. That way you would have to either 51% attack the main chain, or be the only one keeping the side chain up.
Is there another issue I am not aware of?

 - Don't give user root access by default (think chrome OS where you have to go into bios first or something.)

To be honest, I would say move onto chromium or Firefox. And only use open-source extensions (I Believe most Firefox ones are)
If you are being your own bank, you need to take security more seriously, and that starts by choosing software you know is safe. (Although malware can exist in extensions I would recommend you go with well known and popular ones with an active github or similar.)

not a clue, but you can find it on bit coin.org somewhere.
The basic idea is that by proving you destroyed a coin on one block chain, you can create a new line on another. allows for migrating a entire crypto currency into another with completely different rules for mining and signing. while supply and demand get moved at the same rate causing little fluctuation in value.

Gold is meaningful because it is pretty, not much of it (so people envy people with gold and want some) and can be used as decoration.

Bitcoin is technically still in the experimental phase, also its just the core.
Expect over the few years for dedicated hardware that can do things like auto fill your 'hot wallet' from your 'cold storage'.

or services, if you don’t enter the recipient’s
64-character public key perfectly, you will send
the funds to the wrong person. If you’re not using
a hosted wallet provider (a service that helps
manage your private keys), there’s no mechanism
for stopping the payment or getting the money
back. And if you do use a hosted wallet provider,
the provider may disclaim responsibility for helping
you get your funds back.

Many layers of security and features could be added to such a card which require minimal processing power on the cards side while the user not need trust the card reader when making payments.
This list could include but not limited to:
 - The card being completely linked to a service like coinbase so no private keys are actually stored on the card. all transactions will merely be signed by both coinbase and the card allowing for instant verification. Coinbase could act as a escrow service. This would not force the user to sign up to a service but would mean slow confirmations.
 - Secure card deactivation by transferring all coins from the private keys stored on the card. Allowing a service to step in for the user when the user is really clueless.
 - Adding a number pad onto the card to allow for pin based security, without the pin being revealed to the card reader.
 - The provider of the card can put limits on the card to prevent the card spending large amounts quickly.
 - SMS services to allow users to lock their card in an emergency. Or even buy bitcoin that will be sent to the card. This purchase will show up next time you are connected to a card reader.
Message to card for full reset. Requires a full 3 hours of hold confirmation before the card issues the reset, to prevent accidental reset. This can allow cards to be reused without having to produce more. after the reset the card reader would have full privileges and can then perform tasks like flashing the card for a software update. After which the card can be locked again. It is important that the technology is not locked in a way that the user’s freedom is effected and they have the ability themselves to modify software. But make it inconvenient enough that the user is unlikely to be scammed in an eye blink.
 - The front of the card is pretty full with the screen and button. the back of the card has plenty of room for warnings and information to make the card as simple to use.

I get the feeling that when the huge bubbles stop and we have long term stability woth little growth. Then mining will no longer look profitable.
I bet Lots of people who are doing the big mines are holding to get gains in the future. When bitcoin slows down this incentive will be gone. Mining hardware wouldn't be profitable any more as people selling it. Hashing will go down and flatten out.
Bitcoin is still young, people have good incentives to mine still.
When we do get to that point. I can imagine large companies supporting the block chain to secure their own transactions.  Having 10 companies with 8% each is pretty secure as long as they are around the world.
@_date: 2014-08-27 21:57:56
There are 3 types of people in this situation.
1. Miners that like the idea and change to the new rule.
2. Miners who start to get a bigger piece of the original chain and more bitcoins. They would probably stay, as they will loose them if they switch.
3. Everyone else. Who will all loose value switching to the new chain.
Also unless everyone switched, the second chain would provide basically no value as their bitcoins are not on the first chain.

Bitcoin is 'unpredictable', it could rise and fall any time and nobody knows when with any confidence.
Fiat Currencies are very predictable, their value drops at a set rate.
Bitcoin is predictable in the 'amount' of bitcoins, in that you can say that on a certain day, there will be so many in circulation.
Fiat currencies, are unpredictable in the amount. You could end up one day with a government printing lots of it and crashing he whole currency to terrible fire starter.
So in conclusion we have **2 types of volatility** that we need to look at.
1. The volatility of the **spending value** of a currency.
2. The volatility of the **amount** of a currency.

Red Herring is used when you are experimenting and get a wild result that was just a coincidence and does not represent what is actually going on.
For example, you might go fishing and catch a red herring, thinking that there must be more in the lake, when in fact it was a red herring, and it isn't normal to have red herrings in the lake. Maybe it swam away from its normal habitat.
Sometimes this is used in media to bend the truth.

I can top that.
I set up 2 accounts, 1 current account, 1 savings account.
I asked them to move 40% of my paycheck into savings.
Instead of detecting this payment, they simply set it to make a fixed payment from my current to saving account on a fixed date.
My pay check was delayed a day, they started the payment from balance 0 of (what would have been 40% of my paycheck) into my savings and ***charged me for not being able to keep up with payments to my self***
That day I realized the banks are not qualified to handle my wealth. I shortly found bitcoin.

Flip it over and over, counting the number of heads you get in a row.

Another alternative is to use an 3rd party (With 2 of 2 multisig). Useful for small fast transactions like buying a cup of coffee.
Seller needs to trust that the 3rd party won't double spend, buyer needs to trust that the third party isn't going to freeze their funds.
If the 3rd party does double spend, or freeze funds, it can easily be proven and they are going to loose their revenue, which is pointless over a cup of coffee.

You appear to be confused with what bitcoin is.
Bitcoin is a protocol, there is no central server that says who owns what bitcoin. Not coinbase, not blockchain.info not circle.
The Blockchain (not the website, the tech behind bitcoin that powers it) is distributed across thousands of nodes that anyone can set up, they are verified by cryptography (Hence cryptocurrency).
You don't need to 'sign into' a website to use bitcoin, you can download a wallet like electrum and connect to the network of nodes (this is automatic). All you need are 2 things:
1. A seed, electrum tells you this when you open it up first time.
2. A password to encrypt your seed, this is so you don't have to type out the full seed everytime and can use something shorter.
I recommend you write both down on a piece of paper and hide it somewhere safe and secure. You only need the seed to restore a wallet in case your computer breaks or some other issue comes up.
When you want to use it, you can view your balance / receive by just opening it up and clicking relevant tabs.
To spend you will need to enter your password.
**TL;DR Use electrum, Write down Seed for backup, password for day to day use.**

The blockchain of the world replaces the government. It holds records of all land ownage and forces balances to what can be built where.

The blockchain ensures people who own land pay a set tax for the local services.
If a guy comes out with a gun and demands some cash,  give it him. He is now being tracked and will be arrested by your local police. As the blockchain will know everything He does.

A Bit is the basic unit of value in cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2014-06-01 09:27:00
Imagine the blockchain as a decentralized virtual server rather than a ledger.
It has multiple procedures that can be called and memory to work with.
When someone makes a transaction it needs to match a procedure.
When someone gets a transaction they can run it through the correct procedure which will effect the memory.
If during mining we get 2 blocks side by side, you would have to store 2 seperate versions of the memory until one is orphaned.
In addition to the various parameters you would have to procedures, you would have some required ones. These would be an array of signatures , an address to get reward from and the reward amount. This will ensure all actions taken incentivise miners.
As an example you could could have a procedure that is to create a pet. It requires a name, color, style whatever. (Been a while since I played) .
In addition,  you would specify an address to bind it too to prove its yours (just like a bitcoin, accept in this case you can make neopets)
You would have to have a base currency for it to work. also you could expand it to spending the base currency allows you to get random minerals which you trade and craft into items which can be traded. You could also then use the pet in games as an avatar in which you can prove the appearance with the blockchain.
I could go on but I think you get the idea.

Maybe a reputation system could work.
1. You burn some coin.
2. You index a website and sign the index.
3. People download your index and verify your work.
4. People do less and less verifying as you do more indexing.
If you don't index correctly, you loose your reputation.
Verifying reputation is slow. So cannot be done 100% of the time.

Now this system would be very easy to explain to the average joe. Put card in, read screen, press button.
But there is a security issue with untrusted terminals.
The following is a possible solution that can be used.
When the card is supplied it is likely that it will be issued by a company like coinbase (but could be anyone in theory, including yourself) The people that supply the card can put a single write url ‘ and a key onto the memory of the card.
If an untrusted card reader is used, and you want to receive money, but want to be sure that the money you receive is not faked (they could easily say that they have given you 1BTC and not send you anything, as you can not verify with the block chain)
then the card will supply the card reader the url, which the whole transaction will be sent to coinbase which will sign the transaction and send back the signature. The card then then check the signature with the key it has stored in memory. The card can automatically reject the transaction and display a message saying that the transaction is invalid.
    MACDONALDS
    INVALID!
    TRY AGAIN...
This process happens completely automatically without the user needing to think about the possible security implications.
@_date: 2014-01-18 21:19:16


It does not give the reader the private key at all.
the reader gives the card a public key and the card creates a transaction to send back.

Updated doc to include step by step instructions.
1. Customer steps up to till with items ready to pay.
The staff at the till has scanned all items and ready to accept payment.
2. Customer Inserts card into card reader, the transaction cost and their final balance appears on the screen.
3. Customer presses the confirmation button to confirm the transaction.
4. Card confirms when payment is complete and displays message to remove card.

If you had a usb hardware wallet with a screen and a button you could do something like this :
1. User plugs in hardware wallet and loads up bitcoin wallet software on computer.
2. The hardware wallet will communicate with the software and tell it all the public keys it has for displaying balance.
3. User starts making a transaction and sends it to the hardware wallet to be signed.
4. The hardware wallet shows the transaction details and the user can confirm that it is correct by pressing a button.
5. The wallet send the signature back and it can then be broadcast.

It is not a solution to the problem it is meant to solve.
Proof of work tries the sole the question of how to agree on a time to do something in a decentralized way. You need to do work, which takes time. And the chaotic nature of looking for hashes means it is a race to be the first to find the hash.
Proof of work has no race, at any time you can suddenly decide to mine a block which makes it pointless. You could mine 10000 blocks and end up with 10000 possible forks.

Proof of reserves only proves you aren't from taking coins from your stash and spending them rather than keeping them in storage until people need them. Nothing is stopping you take off with them.
On localbitcoins.com, I have bitcoins come straight off there the moment I have bought them and I use their escrow service.
So unless your telling me you are using m of n multi-sig for escrow what is the point?

So from their point of view, they can see all their posts but everyone else won't.

There is a good chance this will be an automatic update in the offical bit coin protocol. Anything already integrated heavily in the bit coin protocol 'should' just prepare their code to accept off the new chain. there is even a good chance that migration could be done totally automatically so addresses have 'versions' and transactions are handled in a generic way.
but you right it is a big 'maybe', but so is cryptocurrencies in general. its only 5 years old. think how long the internet took to get where it is now.

If we could extract market prices of items without people being able to manipulate the price (by say selling to themselves) then we could create side-chains that control the price of its coins and pin them to an asset.
For example, if 1 USD = 1000bits and the rule is to pin the price so that 1 USD = 1bit then you could have it control how many coins are allowed to move to/from the sidechain based on the price.
In this case, it would only allow people to move coins away fro the sidechain increasing supply on the side chain. People won't be able to move to the sidechain until the price of the bit is equal to $1.
As demand for the sidechain increase the price will go up, and when it reaches the price, it stops people from takign from the side chain and only allows them to send bits to the sidechain.
If someone wanted $1 on the side chain but it restricted to only remove from it, they would need to trade with someone else.
Of course, this could be applied to anything.
The key part is coming to a consensus on the price.

Person A Tells Person B their Address to send to. Ebay will keep a record of this address.
Person B sends Person A BTC
If Person A Claims Person B didn't send it, then eBay can use the Address given by Person A to check the blockchain and see if the payment was made.
if it was made then eBay can give Person B Their $
Otherwise, they can refund person A their $

I agree that light apps are more useful (There is a full one AFAIK but I’m sure no one uses any more.)
There is always the possibility of setting up a full node at home as an electrum server and connecting to it with electrum for android (not sure if out yet, but I heard news a while ago.)
Anyway, my point I was making was not about the physical limit of the device, but the artificial limits apple (And some android manufactures sometimes) put on these devices.

If the side chain depends on the main chain for mining (as in you don't find hashes of side chains, but just include the side chains hash in the main chain) then the main chain isn't loosing any hashing power. So I don't see what the issue is.


Unless the feature you want doesn't exist on the current chain, why would you need to?

Heres my prediction.
50 years from now, we will be in a full crypt-anarchy.
There will be no banks, people will maintain their own towns by donating into a pot and the blockchain auto distributes the wealth to people who carry out tasks (Medical/Police/Roads/Electricity/Internet)
Some government things like giving permission to build a powerplant in the middle of a village will be self regulated. To build a powerplant in the middle of the village you would have to buy the land through the blockchain, and then make a transaction signed by everyone that owns the land within a certain distance, verified by the blockchain.
If people break the rules, the blockchain pays a police force to stop builders and seize equipment.
If police turn corrupt, then everyone in the area can make a transaction which everyone has shared to close down the police station, other police in other villages/towns can then step in to enforce and people can vote new police in.
Voting takes an area of land and you have voting power if you own the land.

I think the idea of a till is over.
Convenience is this :
- Walk into a bar/restaurant
- Sit down at a table
- Make your order (This could be by a real person serving or a small screen on table)
- As soon as your order is being sent to cooks/bartender you can pay by placing your phone on the table with NFC built in. NFC will give your phone your order, along with how much it will cost along with a bitcoin address to pay to (standard apps could be made to pretty this information up)
- You confirm on your phone that you want to pay, by the time the food/drink is ready, there would be at least 1 confirmation.
- Enjoy food.
The only place I think this won't work is when you don't plan on staying. Probably because you know the shop already, know exactly what you are going to buy and so could pay in advanced.

I see it as a good thing.
One day, a loop will form, and the companies involved will realise they could just send the bitcoins instead.
The important thing now is just 3 things : 
1. Good wallet software for individual users, it should make everything easy-peasy so your grandma can use it, and handle things like keeping a hot wallet and a dedicated safe at home that should be seamless (like a mini ATM)
2. Good packages that integrate easily into business software (think bitpay/coinbase) It should be professional, reliable and easy. They need to make it so if the company has a supplier that accepts bitcoin, it is just a flick of the switch for them to start sending bitcoins rather than converting to USD.
3. Just get as many businesses using it as possible. Even if they have 0% in bitcoin sales, just having bitcoin integrated means that when their suppliers accept it and their customers do, it is seamless. Because of the deflationary nature of bitcoin, most processors are going to be able to offer discounts. Because of this, suppliers are the most important people to get bitcoin working for, because it is customers who are going to be drawn to the discounts.
@_date: 2014-07-11 19:00:58
You know how you have a bitcoin wallet? Well that had private keys inside. You encrypt them with a password.
When you spend bitcoin you sign a transaction with the private key.
If someone else makes a private key which with bitcoins and gives it you, they still have the key to end the bitcoins.
What means is that instead of making a copy of the private key in your wallet, send them to a new address. This means the person who dropped the private key can't take them back.

It is not a solution to the problem it is meant to solve.
Proof of work tries the sole the question of how to agree on a time to do something in a decentralized way. You need to do work, which takes time. And the chaotic nature of looking for hashes means it is a race to be the first to find the hash.
Proof of work has no race, at any time you can suddenly decide to mine a block which makes it pointless. You could mine 10000 blocks and end up with 10000 possible forks.

As I know, this is not true. You can send some colored to an address and watch them appear instantly on that address, but it must be verified by miners, if not you will double spend. It's totally equals to Bitcoin. Try to send some with 0 fees and check it yourself.

And projects should not be compared to protocols.
Name an open protocol that was around for 5+ years that got replaced.


History hasn't had computer for that long. And if you look carefully, everything is still there from years ago, just under layers and layers of software.


You are comparing efficiency with raw processing power, that is just weird and completely irreverent to the argument.


So? I wouldn't want it if it didn't!


You can already do this using a trusted 3rd party and multi-sig, just needs the infrastructure which is nothing to do with the protocol.


I just gave an example making this point void.


Proof-of-Burn, solves all these imaginary problems.


Good, like any money handling protocol should.


And everyone is going to skip over to it in a heartbeat.


I think the average person would prefer this, you should talk to this group of people more.


Wait, so it isn't ready yet? I'm going back to bitcoin (Queue crash)


software patents are pretty useless against an open source project, and they usually only cover protecting the source code not the idea.


And nobody can buy up Bitcoin (Uppercase) either.


I think that chance of it being replaced is *really* ***really*** low. Not impossible.


You need to compare it to similar technologies to form a worthy argument.
Apples and oranges are both fruit and even that is not close enough apparently.

It is thought that MTGox may have been faking supply of bitcoin, in that people thought they were buying "bitcoin" but they were only buying a number at MTGox, during that period supply would have gone crazily high and nobody would have known that they didn't own bitcoins.
If MTGox had been honest and actually had a supply, I would have thought the price would have reached at least $1600 and probably stay up there for a while and slowly drift down rather than crashing.
This tie around people are being a lot more sceptical of exchanges (Which is good) and keeping it away from them.

3. Choose a password to encrypt your wallet and auto sync it with a cloud storage.
4. For additional devices, just enter your name and encryption and poof your ready to go.
5. To send someone some bitcoins enter their name and if it is a large amount then require a checksum.
6. Although you can type names manually.  There is a good chance you could have been in a discussion or similar.  Use the discussions list of users and your set of saved contacts as a way of checking you typed it correctly.
7. For forgotten passwords, ask the user to write down a 12 word seed when they store a large amount.

Proof of stake is, rather than finding a hash, you prove you have a certain amount of coins. This requires no effort. You could create a block instantly, and another with different transactions. With proof of work you have to work for each block. By the time you find a second one, the rest of the network could be 100+ blocks ahead. Nobody will accept your silly block because there's a chain longer.

I know completely how bitcoin works.
If I wanted to send 100 Bitcoin to mtgox, they give me an address.
After sending it to that address, an internal ledger keeps note of it.
I buy some bitcoins and sell some bitcoins, this makes the internal ledger go up and down.
When I want to withdraw, then it makes a transaction that pulls from all bitcoin deposits.
This even allows for mtgox to give people bitcoins that they don't own (Edit : To clarify, they can sell them to people and end up with less bitcoins than the sum of everyone's wallets). As far as everyone is concerned, they see their balance, but that is not from the blockchain.

Possibly. 
They seem to focus on the idea of simple crowd funding, something kickstarter and indiegogo already do (of course decentralised though)
Croud funding way has so many issues like people claiming the funds and doing a poor job (something a reputation system could fix, but it makes it hard to join)
Also, if you go on a more technical level, there are like code reusability, quality, dependency, documentation and maintainability. All things that could be the difference between 1BTC to 1000BTC in development value and you can't see the difference unless you look at the code.

I'm not certain but sounds like blockchian.info keeps a record of your balance and if it changes from the blockchain it issues a notification.
A double spend could mean that it was sent to your wallet, and blockchain.info created the notifcation, but shortly after because it was a double spend the amount went down so it issued a second notification.
But would take everyone's advice and move it into a new wallet to be safe.

I prefer flow diagrams showing where hashes go.
@_date: 2014-07-19 20:04:32
It is the distribution that matters.
Having 100 people with 1 hashing-power per second each is more secure than 3 people having 2,000,000 million hashing-power per second each.
Also it is about how much hashing power they have, not how much they are actually using, so if 100 people were using 1 hash each, but someone had 100 unused then it is also insecure.
Also to clarify, by secure I mean the ability to prevent to double spend.

Bitcoin can also be made into a convenient form factor (a dedicated wallet or your phone) 


It really isn't, in a lot of places they are cash only, and in others they are completely non existent. Other countries may not be able to set up for credit card due to regulation. They are free to do this with bitcoin.
Bitcoin in time will see more and more adoption. So bitcoin isn't there yet, but can be.


If your device is stolen with bitcoins on it, then you have the ability to move the money out of the wallet and into another (Very simple).


Bitcoins answer to this is escrow.


Bitcoin is like cash, there is no paying back so not really comparable.


In the UK our shops issue their own cards for these types of services, I never knew credit cards had this feature.
Also bitcoin should be compared to cash in hand more than a credit card. You get a credit card, spend with it and give dollar notes to pay it off. The same could be done with bitcoin if the system is required.

4. At this point it should say coins are in escrow. Open your internet banking.
5. Create a new payment, for a person, copy-paste details from localbitcoins.
6. When it says complete mark as complete on localbitcoin.
7. Wait, sometimes they are online and can instantly accept.

In theory, you could make a wallet that automatically creates time locked transactions for every bit that passes through your wallet.
You can then have these saved somewhere, like locally or online.
If you died, all your bitcoins should have a matching transaction that will unlock after a certain time.
You would probably give large amounts a longer time and before the transactions unlock you will need to move them or they could be spent while you are still alive.

Seller makes a wallet, 2 of 3 with buyer and escrow (localbitcoins). Then send requested funds.
If the buyer pays, and the seller is happy, they can both sign the transaction, localbitcoins doesn't even need to interact.
If the buyer pays, and the seller refuses to release the coins, localbitcoins can intervene and sign for the funds to be released to buyer.
If the buyer does not pay, but claims that they have localbitcoins can intervene and sign for the funds to be sent back to the seller.
Remember that the escrow cannot take advantage and steal the coins. only the buyer and seller.

The answer isn't immediately 
 obious if you're not coming from a programming perspective. Although Bitcoin is very useful for solving traditional point-of-sale transactions, it is also important because it will solve transaction problems on the world wide web.
Bitcoin can seem a bit of a mystery at first, with all this talk of "mining," "peer-to-peer," and "addresses." There has even been a growing reation against "Bitcoin-mania," questioning the economic value and outcome of such a sweeping movement. It's helpful to step back and see what it really is, but to do this you must understand mesh systems, another aspect of computing that's full of confusing issues.

I am all for side chains at the moment. They could be useful to move all small frequent transactions where bitcoin is used as long term storage.
The only disadvantage I have seen so far is that a 51% attack can be used to steal bitcoin if kept up for 100 blocks. But I think this could be solved by having additional  validation by the miners to reject these blocks.
@_date: 2014-09-29 10:46:43
Could be useful as a way of having aliases and ip-addresses of nodes stored.
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:50:16
for the UK , localbitcoins
@_date: 2014-11-19 10:28:28


If the side chain's block was hashed and made as a transaction, the hash with the most zero's is the block that goes.
Side chains use little to no power (its proof-of-hash-in-bitcoin) and normal bitcoin miners don't need to verify or mine side-chains at all.
To reverse a side chain would require reversing the main blockchain.
What am I missing?

This is a simple idea of providing a secure, simple and cheap way of allowing people to use bitcoin.
It consists of a traditional ‘credit-card’ shape, but has 2 extra parts. A basic screen, and a confirmation button pictured right.
Initially a user could use a Card reader hooked up to a computer, a bank or terminal. This part must be a trusted party. After inserting a card into a terminal, the user would use the terminals interface to choose options like putting money on the card and displaying a transaction history of the card. When it wants to update it send a message to add new private keys, sending the balance each private key holds (the card has no access to block chain, so this is why terminal must be trusted) The user then receives a message like the following:
    COINBASE
    + 50.00 mBTC
    =150.00 mBTC
The user then presses the confirmation button to accept the amount. The private keys will be added into the memory of the card. Because the card has no blockchain access, it has to trust that the card reader is being truthful about the amount being put onto the card.
Because the card reader could lie about how much it is given, any other card reader could verify that the amount it thinks it has is correct by checking the blockchain with the public keys provided. If in the event of a problem occurring (not very likely) the card reader could offer a format. The output would be as follows : 
       WARNING
      RESET
      =  0.00 mBTC
After holding down the confirmation button for ~10 seconds, the card will be reset.
The card could also be used securely with any store with an internet connection. On inserting the card into the card reader, the computer will then be able to query the card for basic things. For example:
Which public keys are on the card.
System information (Memory, Model number)
Using this information it could then request that the card sign a transaction, an example of what could appear on the card’s screen would be:
    MACDONALDS
    -  3.23 mBTC
    = 33.77 mBTC
After which the user can then presses the confirmation Button to confirm the payment.
The card’s processor will sign the transaction and then hand back the signed transaction to the card reader. The card reader can then process that itself and never have to deal with private keys. It can also power the entire card meaning the card does not need a battery.

The third party's business relies on building trust with the merchants, allowing instant payments without even needing to verify the transaction until later.

If you made a file on your computer that has auto saved transactions ready to be sent, if someone had access to your computer they could then recover the coins.
Of course the block-time variable will need to be included so only after a certain block are the transactions valid. You could also have separate wallets with different settings, so your spending wallet had a short life and your bigger wallet a longer one, because you would need to transfer before the end or you would end up loosing them if someone has access to it while your still alive.

Ok ok. Go ahead and ***try*** and make it work. When you do, then come back and show me how.
Because if one person puts in 1 BTC with 2% monthly interest, you lend 0.2 of it to someone else and the value jumps by 10x, the first person is going to want their bitcoins back. But 20% is missing so you can't do it. Also the person who borrowed now has to make the equivalent of 2 BTC before the price change, maybe they don't have it. What are you going to do?

Why concern is that the government are not doing anything to prepare for a possible disaster.
They are not planning any infrastructure that will help people in case it does cause a crash in the current financial system.
Even if they are not actually doing something that is live, it would help if they at least experimented and made a plan for disaster, and adoption of bitcoin will cause demand for fiat go down making spending power go down.
If they were smart, they would make their own 'pre-mined' crypto-currency or colored coin with a *maximum* equal to the amount of fiat currently and make a trade between fiat and crypto-fiat.
This will hopefully be automatic for all banks and printing will inevitably come to an end.

I think the following will happen:
- taxing income is over, it will become impossible to tax and will move to something else: land tax.
The blockchain can have the concept of land added to it, who owns what, the permissions to build on it, is it a road, is it protected?
Then the blockchain itself charges people a set fee for all their land and they pay it after so many blocks, they could even pay it in advance and the land could be paid for years. This money goes into a pot, and voted on what services it gets used in (police,  medical, etc.)
When someone buys land, then you could have multiple people sign it to ensure security. Services paid by the block chain could ensure that if there is an issue (maybe the person has lost their key) then it can be manually verified by people who have some of the keys.
The best thing is, it would be completely transparent way of voting, and having more voting power means paying more into the system constantly.
I am also interested in seeing if this solves the issue with funding open source (software and hardware), people may be more inclined to vote for projects knowing that it will be properly funded and executed.

But there is a good number of people adopting bitcoin so demand is rising making price go up more than supply is making it go down.
the further we get to 2140 and beyond the higher the price will go.

First, I would definitely recommend localbitcoins.com
Everyone is clearly rated and there is an escrow service.
Second If I were you I would decide early on and carefully what your investment is going to be. Otherwise you will fall in the trap of panic selling which just makes things worse as you lock in your losses.
Thirdly,  don't watch the value 24/7. You will get pretty stressed. In fact avoid the price unless you are buying as you need to know that you are getting them at a good price.

If they are having sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much trouble keeping up with orders, then they should make stock and flash sell it.
- *Sign up to out mailing list to get a 24 hour warning before flash sales*
- 24 hours later, put miners up for auction lasting 1 hour each. update the stock over 24 hours to ensure a fair advantage so we don't have to wake up at 3 in the morning
- BOOM! sales.
- You then had the time to arrange shipping world wide before people knew there was going to be a sale.
- Spend cash making next batch.
- Repeat

A patch would get it going again.
There may even be a setting to temporarily accept the next few blocks and adjust the difficulty.
There is no reason nodes can't automatically reduce difficulty if they don't get blocks for 20+ minutes.
I don't think this is as much an issue as people think it is.

Developers are against Hardforks because it could split the network, but in this scenario there is *no network* anymore until it is made so it is in everyone’s interest to upgrade.
Think about it, nodes have 2 options on fork : 
1. Wait until next difficulty change in 1000000 years.
2. Accept the patch and live to see it running again.

The distance means it is very hard to police and he sees the low reputation as a risk.
People fro china are faceless. You wouldn't even know if it is really coming from china if it wasn't for the postal service telling you.
If you want to fix it, make a reputation system for china so people can differentiate. it will give a face to the people and no longer have a reason to have concerns.

This isn't directed at you but for everyone.
Guys there is literally no point in using sarcasm or humor here, you are probably just going to get down voted.
Now let's have a proper discussion.
Bitcoin would not be a good solution here, because he is under strict rules by authorities and must ask permission. Or risk being shut down and arrested.
If this was one guy who didn't have to support hundreds of workers then there would be no problem. 
Not to mention the risk of loosing money if the price crashes.
If you bought some and it crashes, so what? You are still in work and can eat.
If he bought some and it crashes, he has to explain to a lot of people how they are out of work.
***However***, if bitcoin was accepted by the people and law enforcement didn't get in the way, bitcoin would be a good idea.
Bitcoin hasn't got that kind of stability yet, it isn't going to happen until a lot more gets done.

What would be cool is if you did a large 4-5 year chart (use log so you can see the early spikes clearly) and add quotes with source and arrow pointing to the point on the graph when it was said.

Bitcoin can handle it.
When we hit the block size limit, the low fee transactions will be delayed.
Basically forcing people to do offchain for speed, onchain with delays, or implementing side-chains for speed.

I think if payment channels are implemented, the block size would no longer be a issue.
In theory, you could have channels open for months to an organization and have instant and trust-less transactions between anyone else who has a linked channel to that organization also.
Not only that, but the number of transactions is double the the number of channels.

If at automated by the wallet, I think it could be simple wizard.
1.  code on verifiers website.
2.  Repeat until at least 3 verifiers.
3. transfer funds into new wallet.
And if a verifier goes bad :
1. Select bad verifier.
2. disable verifier.
3. scan new verifier.
At this point it will move all existing funds into a new address.

No Charge Backs is cheaper for businesses. Businesses prefer customers who would use system where there are no charge backs. Businesses offer discount. Consumer benefits.
If a customer needs any more protection then it will have demand and an the option will appear. However consumer protection isn't in big demand with bitcoin yet.

Imagine 2 people send messages across a network.
One says Bob pays Jane his 10BTC,
Another says Bob pays James 10BTC.
Jane and James gets the message at the same time but not yet got the opposing transaction which means a double spend.
So to solve this we set a reward that if you solve a puzzle, you can tell everyone the transactions you currently have (Which is bound to the puzzle and the previous) and that will be accepted as the correct order.
It is unlikely that 2 people could solve the puzzle in under the time it takes for everyone to get the message so you can make the assumption that that solution is the only solution. That either Bob paid Jane, or James.
Of course someone with 50% or more puzzle solving power could over take other people causing 2 solutions. It could be either one or the other. If the person with this power was making  a payment, they could exclude it from their solution and double spend.
**tl;dr** It solves 'How do you come to consensus on the order of transactions in a decentralized system'

For the first 5 or so years of bitcoin, if you held for longer than a year you were going to profit.

Bitcoin is a digital currency, the network producing new 'coins' at a fixed rate, after the halvening, this rate will be halved.

**"Let It Go"**
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation,
And it looks like I'm the queen.
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried!
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know!
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door!
I don't care
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on,
The cold never bothered me anyway!
It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all!
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me I'm free!
Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry!
Here I stand
And here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on!
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back,
The past is in the past!
Let it go, let it go
When I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone!
Here I stand
In the light of day
Let the storm rage on,
The cold never bothered me anyway!

Bitcoin functioned perfectly in this situation. It was the company you were interacting with that failed.
If you have proof of them giving you an address to send bitcoins to. Then you could probably take it to your local law enforcement if the amount is large.
If you don't trust that company then you need to look towards escrow using multisig.
If bitcoin had a feature that let you reverse transactions, then that would be the real design flaw.

I had an idea where every commit you make you first make a transaction on the blockchain that proves you made it. (If millions are happening, it can easy be just the combines hash of those million commits, to keep it cheap)
Then to donate you run through the history current version you have finding out who has contributed to it the most. Excluding things like whitespace changes and unused code. Passing it through a formula to reward code that **survives the longest** until you end up with a list of contributers with a score.
If it was even more clever, it would link up issues/features so you can donate to people who contributed to a specific area. This could include categories like comments, graphics, a specific plug-in, an interface or enhancement.
Even more clever, it could run tests hat aren't obvious to a user like code maintainability and reuse, meaning people who write better code are more likely to soak up donations.
In the end, it is up to the user who to give the money to, but it would provide a way of knowing who is really contributing to a project and who is adding empty spaces to every line for free tips.

You don't need to do on chain transactions for simple things like buying a coffee. Things like the lightning network should be sufficient.
I would be interested in hearing how many transactions per second would be needed to cover transactions over 5 BTC
@_date: 2015-09-05 13:26:57
In theory, the only part in a lightning network that could benefit being centralised is a match making system to find a number of channels you can make a payment through. Making giant single nodes where everyone connects to is completely unnessisary.
To illustrate, take a look at this video :
As people do frequent business together, they can make dedicated channels, these channels can be be indexed by servers and those serves can do lookups for people to find the closest connection.

Let me clear it up for you.


 - Bitcoin is not a centralized Operation, you can't have "Official"
 - Not everyone lives in the US. Getting everyone around the world to go to your conference is far more expensive and pointless than having smaller local conferences and publishing them online.


Bitcoin is not an industry. 


Well that is because it is way more popular than bitcoin.


Well, isn't that because everyone is dressed up in costumes and came for the party? Seems bitcoin conferences while could be fun to an extent, would attract people that are coming for the more technical discussions.


If you don't want people to make fun of you, accept the criticism and re-think over what you said before replying.
Instead of this:












you could say something like this:








Not only will you not sound like a kid having a tantrum, people are more likely to support you.
Another thing that doesn't help, is you clearly have little experience in actually organizing conferences, you might want to look at the cost of these sort of things and you might realize in calculating this, that it is unfeasible.
If it is feasible, go and do it, nobody is stopping you!

What is a 'user'? If a server is making bitcoin transactions that a user has asked it to do, do you include each of those users? What if the user is unaware bitcoin is being used behind the scenes? What if the server doesn't have users at all and is making transactions automatically by itself? Is the server it's self a user? What if a user uses multiple services that all use bitcoin? You can't simply add the total users of each service either. Do you count the number of people conscientiously using bitcoin? Are people using coinbase actually using bitcoin? or are they using an sql database that happens to allow for transactions to bitcoin?
TL;DR The question pointless because it isn't a question that be answered in a meaningful way.

@_date: 2015-09-05 19:50:05
That is kind of what i meant when I said: 




I assume by hub you mean someone with open channels?
If you have open channels, you have to run a server anyway (So you can broadcast the transactions at the right time.) and anyone with a server could help the network by providing more channels for little cost. In-fact, i think we will find nodes could make a profit by taking fees for being useful for other people.

It is possible to use multiple channels at once (provided certain features added to bitcoin) that would allow you to securely send from A to B and B to C in one step. So if everyone has channels open, you just need to find a route and make the payment.

To extend, i expect 99% of transactions would be done over the lightning network, the only transactions not done on chain would be moving coins to longterm storage and massive b2b transactions.
From what i have heard, the only weaknesses are if you are unable to post the transaction in time and the other person is malicious enough to take back the coins. Or the other person you have the channel with stops co-operating and your funds are temporarily frozen. Neither of which I think are likely because you would open channels with people you expect to make many transactions with.

If I remember the Idea behind lightning network correctly, rather than have 1 actual transaction per desired transaction, you have 2 transactions per channel per time period.
The idea being, to lock the funds in the first transaction, and have the latest transaction in the second, but keep that off chain and with a timer before valid.
This isn't way, users can shift funds between themselves by redoing the second transaction with a shorter time before valid.
It's been demonstrated, that when you coordinate multiple channels, you can actually send money down through multiple channels.

Yes, but when you have a public key, that issue no longer exists, because you then have a way of proving tha the data is coming from the correct source.
I imagine that sounds would take a long time to transfer data across, especially if you started doing something a bit more fancy than just an address like a digital receipt (Maybe even some codes for discounts) allowing you to keep a good record of your spendings.

Or 2 for the customer, 1 for exchange.
the customer can have one address/seed in cold storage and a hot one on their phone or laptop.
The exchange also has one.
For day to day transactions, the customer would ask the exchange to sign all transactions, but if the exchange turns on them they can use the cold storage address to unfreeze them.
If the customer looses their device or cold storage, then they can use the other one with the exchange to create a new one.
For in case they loose both, then the exchange could offer to hold an encrypted version of their hot wallet.

Only people with specific roles would be public, and the position would require it. Individuals would still have privacy.
As an example, the role of constructing and maintaining a network.
The block chain would be paying an elected group to do the needed job, their actions will be published by multiple other groups and progress monitored.  individuals would be under an alias (something the blockchain also recognises) and also other groups involved like suppliers.
 
From everyone's point of view, they see good reviews and proof of where money is being spent. if they disagree with something (maybe they notice that they are installing non open equipment or excessive spending is made) they can vote for a group that achieves it better. (A group isn't a company, the individuals are employed by the blockchain for use by the role who makes decisions.
Now, about privacy : when aliases get their pay, that is where the privacy starts. They could mix their coins, use stealth addresses etc and not be judged on how you spend it.
Also as a note, there would be nothing stopping robots taking the roles, which would have less of a privacy problem in some cases.
But your right, you can't have it both ways, it needs to be one or the other.

The single biggest issue is that open-source supports this idea that the people who make the software also use the software or put there own product on top to sell to other people whether that be propitiatory software or services.
Things like games are generally made by a small number of people and played by a large number of people. The solution? Make frameworks open source so many game developers can quickly collaborate and then create a game with those frameworks. Just to name a few : Bullet Physics, OpenGL, Box2D

Where are you from?
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:31:48
which is why you should not store more than £100 (online where you don't have private keys).
In theory these companies that store your bitcoins online could have a server set up to suck the majority of bitcoins into a set of offline wallets, only opened when needed. This way if they are hacked, they have a chance of black-holing as much of the surface bitcoins into offline wallets, put up warnings so people know their money is protected and only start back up after problems have been solved.
Of course there is nothing stopping them from charging protection for this service in the event of a hack and an amount being stolen.
EDIT: Quick rundown of a good system.
Encrypted wallet of user stored on server where separate password is required (bulk could be stored).
encrypted wallet based on password with small amount for convenient spending stored online.

I can name several off the top of my head.
1. Secure way of storing money, if it gets stolen, you just pick up a different device. (as long as cheap hardware is made)
2. I can imagine parents have to walk large distances to get to places. If this ever happens, they could send money to each other by text.
3. Very good way of getting donated money to them. If everyone accepts bitcoins then money can be given to people so they can get food/shelter.
4. They could easily start a business and not worry about people robbing their earnings. Also if they trade often they are safer because they can't get robbed of the money they carry around.

How to help people : 
This is a wallet, don't give this to people
This is a key for your wallet it stops people getting into that if they do get hold of it.
this is an address, this is like an email and people can send you money by entering this.
this is a paper wallet, it has sensitive information that could be used to steal money from you, make sure to keep it in a safe place.
AND SO ON.

- Not everyone here is on 24/7
- Not everyone has posted an address
- Not everyone has a bticoin wallet
If reddit had a built in feature to have your own address a click away, then we would use that. The alternative? Posting your address in every comment.
If everyone had a wallet, and and address attached to reddit, we would not need bots.
Its like saying email is hard to use. Its not, just it would mean everyone would have to constantly share their address which is a pain.
It is easy to reach into your pocket and pull out a dollar and give it to someone, but it is a pain to do that every single time someone says something good, it would be easy to just say "hey have a dollar!" and your dollar magically jump from your pocket to theirs.

Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

I don't want you to feel bad, I just want to remind you that bitcoin is not 'deflating and inflating' it is just inflating.
inflation : more money printer / Bitcoins mined
deflation : money destroyed or lost / Bitcoins destoryed or lost.
Even though bitcoin is currently inflating (at 2.5BTC min) it is gaining and loosing value.
eventually it will be deflating (no more made and they will slowly be lost)

A baby or a kid this woudn't apply to, I agree with you there.
But for 16+ this would be very useful.
It's the long term benefits you really need to think about.
Just think about how before the age of the printing press, technological advancements took centuries. As soon as you add a communication layer productivity increases dramatically because everyone hears things that are happening at distant places. Same with the internet.
And we are going to see the same sort of trend happening with bitcoin.
Also if you read about these poor areas of the world, they tend to have phones already, so infrastructure is there. now we just need cheaper phones. (maybe a dedicated global network for bit coin)
But yer... a starving guy is going to find food more useful than a phone
in the short term, but in the long term, he could contact people in far out areas that have an abundance of food, but lacking good building materials for example. A few calls and they can make a trade. now 2 entire villages have good shelter and good food, because they got in contact.
So back to my point 4. if you use a currency (I don't know how popular cash/gold is over there) then you have a risk being robbed (its very easy to steal a wallet) but if you have a phone, not only is it track-able, you still have your money.
There is a reason we built the structure we have today in our 1st world areas, because it is efficient.
tl;dr. it makes everything much more efficient, but probably not for kids

I know the Sell Sell Sell Messages would appear, but that will just be a good opportunity again for people to buy into bitcoin when the price drops.
I think at this point the market as a whole has realized that bitcoins bounce back up in price every time it drops, so there are plenty of eager people buying when this happens (Just look at this chart and you will see it 'bouncing' off of the $500 mark, just zoom in as the lines aren’t very accurate at full view.)

right now it is a sort of of problem if they kept it as bitcoin. but as many before me have said, businesses often convert strait to USD.
now, as long as adoption continues, this won't happen for ever.
eventually most services will accept bit coin so there won't be any point converting to USD cause you can just pay your bills in bit coin.
this also means because people are spending bit coin more, the value will stablize, because they have more use.

What is stopping them get homes? Getting the materials?


What is stopping them get education? Could not cheap internet solve this?


What type of opportunity would this be? A job? If so why are there no jobs? Are there places where there are too many jobs and not enough people? I would say that building homes, farming and teaching are the most important jobs. But like I said before, the building materials and the good farming land may be in completely separate locations.
Or in the worst case, there are no good places to farm and/or get building materials.
In which case you should start importing crops that can easily grow in areas to start them off, including plants that can be cut down for materials.
Other than that, there is water, but it looks like the solution to that is just filters.
The only question left is : what do they use as currency to make the trading as frictionless as possible? Small villages are fine with just bartering until they start getting a flow of people going in and out. Then they are going to need a currency.
Also who is going to regulate the currency? If the government is being destructive then using their local currency might be useless. Do they have gold and silver for trading? If they had a gold/silver backed currency then they are at risk of being robbed. Now, like I said before : small villages don't need a currency. But it would be useful if one of them in each village operated a exchange for people bringing in goods from far places. Then the locals could have their speciality (farming or building materials) then buy and sell with traders coming in and out.
Now if this trading was fuelled by bitcoin, then think what charities could do then!
They could instantly send value to struggling villages while they build their own small businesses. Allowing them to buy food of tradesmen while working to build houses and purchase food.
Is there any other resource other than food/shelter/water that I have missed?

See, if you go and jump all your cash hoping to get rich quick, that is gambling. short term is too volatile
but if you put in a small amount gradually over time and making careful judgement (don't go crazy when the price drops or goes up) then you are investing.
I have so far put in £20 and when the guys at localbitcoins realise they aren’t selling any and lower their price, I will buy another £10 worth.
THIS is investing, I come here everyday and read about bit coin, read about the algorithms the businesses the history and so on. I have even given myself a spending cap of £100 because I need the money to live as well.
Because I have only invested small amounts I can take advantage of the way the money goes. If it it goes up 'woo hoo' I have made a profit. If it goes down, oh well ... I will hold on to them. Because as we have seen time and time again, it makes a nice slow recovery past the previous spike.

That's already happening.
To 'Back' a currency means to take the value of that other object as the base value of the currency in that if the value of that other object were to change, so would the currency.
The answer here is pretty clear
So for example, to back a coin with gold, means that if the currency becomes pretty useless (maybe you move to a country where it is not recognized) then you could melt it down into raw metal and sell it for the same value.
To back the Dollar with bitcoins is to mean that if the currency is useless in a situation, then you can open it up and read the private key. The case left behind has its seal broken so would no longer be accepted. But the bitcoins can now be spent.

This is only a short term attack, it would cost millions to keep it running and the chance of keeping it quiet it very low.
Double spending with 50% hashing power means every 10 mins you have 50% chance of being found out and your transaction being rejected. At which point *alarm bells*. Also you loose all that money you spent attacking, and now people will probably label and track your address.
Also apparently, some of the biggest miners have hardware on standby if anything like this happens.
Not to mention that if the value were to suddenly go down, the value of your bitcoins would also go down.
It's a loose - loose situation unless you intend to destroy bitcoin no matter how much money it takes.
IMHO I don't actually think this is a very likely thing at all, and if someone were to get that much power, why not just monetize it?

At which point hopefully it will just propagate messages warning people to wait longer for extra confrimations on receiving bitcoins before accepting payment (remember that these payments will be in the millions of USD so people with only small transactions are not really going to be affected)
So yes it is a pretty tough one to crack.

And also a few options:
- Live help (A text chat with a real person when there is an issue)
- Retry
- View Technical details.
If there exists an app that does this already, then lets start fitlering people into that app instead. If not, bit coin is not ready for the average user. And this would be a great opertunity for business!

Bob : Well Here is a single unit of every currency on the table.
Bill : They are pretty much the same thing, just different colors. What's that one on the end?
Bob : It's a bitcoin. Basically internet money.
Bill : That sounds cool, we will go with that :D

Here's the thing.
You have 2 options with that much hash power.
 - Use it to your advantage to double spend, spend possibly millions keeping the hardware running hashing faster than the rest of the network. To do so you would have to make sure the amount your spent is at least half of what you spent on the hashing or you will be making a loss. Then you also hope that the first entity you are giving money doesn't wait for extra transactions. (every transaction they make they are rolling the dice between discovering if there is a double spend trying to happen, if you had 50% hashing power, every confirmation has a 50% chance of finding the double spend and rejecting it) at which point I would be surprised if they didn't tell someone.
Result : If you do manage it, bit coin would collapse and you will loose anyway.
- Be honest and just keep the bitcoin reward.
Result : You make a profit, everything stays secure.
Honestly which one would you choose?

I have an idea : Send random hardware through mainstream postal services kitted out with a mobile network connection, gps, microphone and camera and continually send it around the world between trusted people to see what it picks up along the way, then post them online.

sorry by harddrive it could be any storage really.
This is more about security (think 100's of BTC which you would not keep on a phone.) and cold storage made easier

That is completely useless.
If the value of a PPC is $1 and there were 100PPC (so $100)
and everyones PPC where to double so there is now 200PPC
the value of a PPC is now $0.5 (so $100 total value)
the government on the other hand print money and give it to specific people, technically you could say they are taking a small percentage of value from people and giving it to specific people.
A useful thing for a cryptocurrency would be that if an ammount was sat in a wallet without moving for a period of time (say 10 years) then it is automatically pushed to the miners meaning the value of the currency should theoretically stay the same forever, as it would be impossible to 'loose' money.
Please correct me if i am wrong, constructive replies welcomed.

Yes, because to send an email to someone, you have to 'scan' in your letter then send it to them and they have to find a printer to print it off so they can read it.

So you think it will be easy for them to sell a large amount of bitcoins?


...or destroy their own money?


From What? If they are devaluing the goods they bought AND spent a fortune attacking the network, then I have no idea how they are getting a profit.
If they got other people involved with the attack (and charged USD to fund), the message will go viral and everyone will be sceptical to accept low confirmations.
Honestly, if someone was paying you 1000 bitcoins, how many confirmations would you wait before accepting?

They could try, but I think its just going to be too expensive.
If they try to buy the bitcoins cheap, they will drive the coins value back up
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:52:18
I have heard you don't need to be on the internet if you are the one paying (only the one receiving needs confirmation)
So you could have an offline wallet that has a camera that scans a qr-code allowing for the transaction to be generated which could then be sent one way to the person you are paying (yourself for example).
Edit: allowing an offline wallet that auto generates transactions to yourself and sends them to your 'live wallet' in intervals. Because the transactions are already made. Any money you don't need, you just send back to the cold storage wallet.
Correct me if I'm wrong

Good analogy is this:
You have a coin. Every 10 mins you flip it and if it is heads you will know if there is a double spend otherwise everything looks normal.
For 1,000,000 I would wait at least 10 before I thought things were going fine.

misconception there. transactions are not faster, infact it may even be slower. its the confirmations that are quicker, but a lot of people have looked into it and said it gives no real benefit.
1 confirmation in litecoin =/= 1 confirmation in bit coin.
the thing that makes it secure is the ammout of time spent.

In the same way you have email hosts, you will have bitcoins hosts.
It really would be easy to have a ridiculously simple server that holds names and throws back a public address when called. It would take me an hour to make (The hard part is adoption).
Companies could just put the server on their own domain and people that make wallets on coin base could have username for example.
