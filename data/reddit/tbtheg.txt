Apparently they've not been honouring orders for months and taking money, I'd hold off. But I don't know, I'm not a doctor.

Shouldn't it have given my $1.50 back then?
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:40:10
That site isn't loading or something, when I type in the hash it just loads for 10 mins. I don't really care about the $1.50, it just sucks that handed it over for nothing. It says it took 13mins to confirm, but it sat Unconfirmed for at least 5 hours.

Cavirtex bruh
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:12:08
Similar to how I feel after selling at $260 (CAD)
@_date: 2013-03-21 03:20:33
Gee, thanks. Problem Solved. You're the greatest :)
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:17:19
Ahhh the fees. Cavirtex is really my best option. I suppose I'll just wait, Do   a few surveys in my spare time for peanuts. Although to be honest, I don't really mind, I'm at .0101 BTC already, tru ballin'

Sold a good portion at $258 (CAD), looking to buy more at a better price.  I do believe in BTC, but I've got bills to pay and mouths to feed. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:46:12
Let's put it this way : If you had some Bitcoins now, would you sell them? Or hold on to them?
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:44:01
Sounds like a an awesome idea, I love me some gambling.
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:59:26
Can anyone help me get this btc? I'm reading the [help] but It's confusing, has anyone ever done this?
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:42:42
Or your mother 
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:24:17
Any Canadians should switch to Cavirtex.ca , they're pretty solid. I've never had any issues.

I can make shitty things in paint, is that something you'd be interested in?

I don't know, I'm not a doctor
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:36:29
Where do you live? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:54:22
Is there any way to change the units to USD or CAD?
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:04:22
This happened to me 2 days ago, it took my money, I can see in the outgoing transactions. There is no incoming at all and hasn't been for 2 days. It was only like $3.00, but still, stealing is stealing.
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:27:53
Totally giving this a thorough look when I wake up (in bed on phone atm). I think this idea is awesome.

"Shhhh" - Big Player
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:44:21
If you were currently holding some Bitcoins now would you sell them? Or keep them? 
Do you feel the price could increase?
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:25:58
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:16:20
I can't tell you who, but the reason is price manipulation.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:08:28
With a bit of stability I could see this being viable 
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:33:40
I know, the fees are fucking stupid. It's really my only problem with them.  Although, I do appreciate the incredible amount of security with Cavirtex, all that off-site backup business and what not. I just hate the fact that there's a fee for buying BTC, then the same fee for selling.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:15:08
I've used them in the past, but that fee is just so incredibly ridiculous that I've since switched.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:16:06
People are trading
@_date: 2013-03-21 02:57:35
They do, but it's not any bank.  And the banks in my town are among the ones that aren't included.
