Bitcoin atms suck bc they are made by a corporation looking to make profit. Idk why doesn’t the flipping community get together and create a next-to-no-fee atm. Non profit. We need to do this. Who is with me?

I hope that you realize that bitcoin is not just about a price tag. It is a way of life it is a revolution. By having bitcoin now you are taking responsibility to be leaders of the new age that is coming. You are the CEO’s of the future. I don’t think many bitcoin users understand this or can ever if you keep focusing on a price tag.

On “open bazaar” an open source desktop marketplace. You can find my store there. 
@_date: 2019-03-24 22:35:05
A lot of people say buy. However, I think the best way to get a taste is you can offer your skills and services for bitcoin. There is a reddit for that someone will post it. Sell yourself for bitcoin basically. You don’t have to have any particular skills just offer whatever you have.  There are bitcoin millionares waiting for ordinary people like you to join the network.

Funny it hit a new high and then a new low all in the same heading. Bitcoin as usual. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 03:53:23
Some questions. Since the fiat cards and bitcoin wallets are on the same device. Could they potentially be used to identify the bitcoin wallet. I guess if you don’t want that you could  just not add any fiat cards but then will that prevent you from still using the POS system? 
@_date: 2019-02-24 03:57:58
Okay I’ll take the time to educate you. 1. The current fiat system fluctuates in value all the time but you don’t notice. 2. As adoption grows the fluctuations will decrease. 3. The fluctuations that remain will not be noticeable since the values will automatically update using computer code. Leave the complicated parts for the professionals. When bitcoin adoption hits the road you don’t have to think about anything except what you want to buy and how much. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 17:26:16
When you are ready for that step BTCpay is the way to go.

Hodlhodl  Localbitcoins (although they have being compromised by kyc and who know what else.).  Bisq.  Bazaar marketplace  even Gemini is a good alternative.   
@_date: 2019-04-28 20:47:56
Sucks thy are  using  coinbase. They should be using a segwit enabled Wallet but w/e.
@_date: 2019-04-14 21:04:19
Do you know anyone that would be willing to work for bitcoin? I need a couple people that have experience in computer programming or are willing to make an advertisement.
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:00:39
The point is buy bitcoin, buy your freedom, and hold your keys! Not your keys not your bitcoin! Viva le revolución.

@_date: 2018-11-05 01:44:43
Yup the button works now. I’ll play around with it when I get the chance. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 20:15:21
It’s great you guys finally activated segwit...but I’ll stick to samourai wallet.

No one should use coinbase to be honest. I once logged into coinbase pro for the first time and the main page was a chart of bitcoin cash ��‍♂️. All other exchanges put the real bitcoin as the main first page but no not coinbase. I am telling you novograts is against the space and most of these media people are against us. 
@_date: 2018-11-04 17:20:29
I am guessing you are still building it. Non of the channels work so far. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:51:16
If you had focused on the tech you wouldn’t have sold. Even if it goes to 1k. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 22:56:36
Good thinking not your keys not bitcoin. Welcome to the community! thank you for taking the time to learn about the basics of bitcoin. Store your keys in a very safe place.

@_date: 2018-11-04 17:42:22
You don’t need to rent a place dude stop saying you need funds it sounds scammy af. And in this community we know all about scams. You want to make a difference show us what you can do with as less amount of funds as possible. You are telling me people can’t meet at a park and have a loud speaker come on dude. You sound like an ico that wants to get funded and millions of dollars and then squanders it. ICOs was last year. Like I said stop thinking that you need funds start with 5 people at meetings then more will follow. And when they see consistency it will peek people’s curiosity. You don’t need money upfront to build a community. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 06:09:28
I hope you all withdrew your coins from the exchanges as a reminder of what bitcoin stands for. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:07:21
As a game player, this is great.

@_date: 2018-11-04 17:32:21
It is great that you want to spread information. However you need to go back and read the history of bitcoin. You shouldn’t be trying to get in just as an investment you will get rekt emotionally mentality socially. The reason for bitcoins existence is about FREEDOM. Anyway, good for Albania I know some Albanians, they are a bunch of characters lol.

Samourai wallet bro. But I get your point.

They might as well just buy bitcoin instead of withdrawing cash. At least half half.

Guys please don’t get rekt. It might be a while before the new price come to fruition. Don’t leverage  just hold spot. And keep your funds in your own wallet (not on an exchange). You don’t know which one we’ll  samourai is a good one or many of the ones on bitcoin.org (not dot com! dot “org”)
