Which doesn’t necessarily mean a price increase. Remember when bitcoin was new, mining was at its lowest and so was price? Why should it be any different?

Positive news never stops flowing from coin sites whose writers have a bias and personal interest in btc going up, not down.

Just in time to watch the chaos ensue.

Bitcoin is not an asset. Wait until it drops back to under $1 before you do a 10y comparison to other markets.

Bitcoin is not a secure investment under any circumstances, nor is any investment, since they all have some level of risk. But bitcoin is particularly risky.

Exactly right. Bitcoin may be up over the SP500 but no one is going to (if they are sane) going to invest their retirement fund in bitcoin. I feel sorry for the people who did and are now -75% in the hole because of thoughtless and totally unfounded posts like this that try to keep the hype train running.

Remember that many people lost a lot of money buying at 18k a year ago. The same thing could be said a year from now if you buy at 4K. Just be careful and be prepared to lose all of your money, since the possibility is always there that it could drop to zero tomorrow. You’re better off with traditional investments.
