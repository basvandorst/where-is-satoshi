Yes, theoretically you just need a single connection to the lightning network. Some people or use cases will want one or more failover connections. 
You are paid a fee when you route a transaction, in payment for your services. Your own transactions do not count as in that case you are making use of a service, not providing it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:42:29
Same as bitcoin and a lightning node. And guess what, you can be paid by routing transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:09:41
When a user originates a transaction, he (or realistically, his wallet) will specify the route to his destination in full. He has control over some variables of the route his transaction will take; for example, amount of hops, and max fees to be paid.
So, if you want to route transactions, it'd help for you to
1. be well connected. This is relative. If you are the only link to, say, a darknet market somebody you know controls, everything will route thru you.
2. have cheaper enough fees. If there's a path thru you that makes the overall transaction fee cheaper than going thru a well connected but expensive hub, there's a good chance people will use your service.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:25:27
You use multisig. You don't 'send' you coins to a remote hub, but allocate them to a shared channel. You can unilaterally close it and retrieve your share at the moment whenever you want.
This is completely basic, but you ignore it completely while self-assuringly pontificating and predicting.

I hadn't considered this; thanks for your reply. Thinking a bit deeper, I believe the problem with this argument is that it tends to perpetuate a status quo; savers who are protected, and the poor who are taxed on almost all their income, diminishing their savings potential.
Those two forces, applied over time, would tend to a concentration of wealth for some, and a hand to mouth existances for many.
Expanding on this, and moving into political territory, the wealthy have more political power than the poor, and they would tend to maintain this *status quo*. The reduction of this tax for the poor would help level the playfield, and lift many rom the proletariat.
So, in my opinion, maybe it's not the optimal thing to do from an economic perspective of maximizing output, but I believe the social advantages outweigh this efficiency loss.

Yes, no goalpost moving here.

No. When you unilaterally limit the universe of discussion to 'developed' countries, you are subtly steering the discussion to conditions that favour your point of view.
For example, by doing that, you are negating my counterexample of Argentinian developers, without directly addressing its validity. You can just gloss over it, as Argentina is not a 'developed' country.
If you are doing this unconciously, I'll urge you to open your mind - there's a bit of fishbowl thinking going on. 
The world does not end in the USA, and in bitcoin's particular case, the thirld world has a lot of uses for it, not in the last evading capital controls and legal or otherwise remittances.

1. You assume he saves every satoshi. That does not seem realistic - on your fiat salary you'll typically save about 10%. I have no idea of how much he spends weekly using bitcoin, but he certainly won't be saving 100%.
2. You assume he is subject to tax on his earnings. He may not be in the US. He may be paid on a less than formal agreement.
For a quick example, the people I know that get paid in BTC are argentinian developers, who freelance to foreign companies under the radar of the argentinian fiscal authorities and get paid in bitcoin as a way to circumvent capital controls.

Now, how much money does it flow via SWIFT? [5 Trillion dollars a day](
Now, let's assume we use ALL bitcoin in existence just to take over this.
5E12 / 21E6 = 238.000 USD. 
Now, let's assume a clearing time of two hours. So, you can recycle the same bitcoin 12 times a day.
238.000/12 = 19.000 USD potential value of a bitcoin, JUST if it were used for international trade, and not taking into account its value storage function, or domestic transaction demand.

The country doesn’t have the same brand recognition of those locations, but Uruguay is appearing to perfect the ‘slow and steady’ approach to becoming a top tier player in software development methodologies, e-commerce and Web app development.*
*Uruguay now regional leader in software industry
Montevideo, Nov 6 (NNN-Prensa Latina) - The head of the European Commission (EU) delegation for Uruguay and Paraguay, Geoffrey Barrett highlighted the development of the Uruguayan software industry, which has positioned the sector as a regional leader.*
*He noted that in less than ten years Uruguay has doubled software sales in foreign markets, reaching US$220 million last year.*

If you still think it's going higher, just set aside a small **fixed** amount of money every week or month, and buy bitcoins with it. 
It's called dollar cost averaging. You'll be taking action, even if it's 50 USD per month[1], and riding out the emotional rollercoaster - when bitcoin is cheap, you'll get more, and when it's dear, you'll get less.

Also, what is a crime in some jurisdictions is not a crime in others. You can be condemned to death for apostasy in some middle east places.
Prostitution &amp;marijuana use are illegal in the USA. Not in my country.
Buying an unregistered weapon in the USA is legal. Try that in the UK.
And so on. The bitcoin foundation is arrogating on itself the task of global enforcer of every little country laws, and in doing so, crippling it.
Edit: Do you see the [WWW consortium]( pushing for tags to be added to HTTP requests  to 'illegal' websites? Think about it. After all, there are a *lot* of 'illegal' websites. For example, the New York Times in China.

Money, not necessarily. You can set the miner fee to 0.0.

Yes. That bank would also be subject to busts, as there's no way to conjure bitcoin out of thin air in order to inject liquidity.

It's interesting that HFT *now* crashes the current infraestructure. 
Yes, of a russian bucket shop. But it's the best you have. And just a couple of bots going back and forth microtransactions crashes it?
This was just a preview.
I'm a single guy scalping the EUR and the JPY. I enter hundreds of trades in a day. I'm about 0,0000025% of the total volume traded in a day (yes - I calculated it).
All those trades are confirmed. There's a real counterparty out there, and it's a real transaction.
 When the *real* forex market comes to town, brace yourself.

Au contraire. See the venezuelan stock market. Having a share in a (profitable - no twitter, please) company is a claim on a money producing enterprise.
A much worse investment would be bonds or just letting your money in your bank.

Oh, we agree that there's two flavours of BTC. That's why I explicitely said that MTGox was a bucket shop, drawing the line against a real trading firm with counterparties in other exchanges, like the forex market.
The actual, amateur one crashes the current infraestructure. If there's not an upgrade in infraestructure, or real trading firms come into play, this will happen again and again.
The long-term threat in the horizon to the blockchain is still there. And I'll repeat my two answers
i) You can set the transaction fee to 0.00
ii) You won't care about confirmations. You'll just spam orders.

Volatility is purely a function of how much money you commit.

Denninger coined 'Bitcon' in march/2013. 
At the time a bitcoin was USD 150, give or take. Right now it's about 1100.
A 733% gain.
He also was flogging BBRY stock to his followers. At the time, it was about USD 15. Right now it's 6.37.
A 58% loss.
