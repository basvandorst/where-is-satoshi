There was a movement to archive all the series that only existed on MT and [move to something better]( but I don't know if it's going to die now. This news is actually probably a bad thing.
The scanlation scene is very decentralized, similar to how the dubbing scene use to be, except the scanlation is magnitudes worse due to how much more content there is yearly. The dubbing scene eventually moved (with much drama) over to ` (Possibly NSFW-ads).
Having the entire manga community to switch over to something like that and have the same kind of stability would mean that: 
* Series naming has to be consistent. This is **not** a small task, the community can't even agree whether to stick with full Romaji or English. The guy who was a major part of centralizing the dubbing groups has [this](
up, but it remains to be seen if even he can get this movement going.
* The drama would need to end. 90% of manga will never get an official translation outside of Japan and out of those only a small fraction will ever get someone who wants to translate it (unofficially, if you get what I mean). This means that when a group or person announces that they are working on a title, it's almost as if they are claiming it. Anime dubbing is very different, with few series a year and many groups, there isn't much of a name you can make with any one series. Honestly, this is one of the biggest problems.
* There has to be understanding among the community that it is in their best interests. Just like in real life, people won't come together if they think they can get a better deal elsewhere. There are still those who read on MangaFox, which is like watching Youtube on 240p.
I could go on, but I think I gave you the gist of it.
