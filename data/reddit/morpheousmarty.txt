Every time you don't sell your dollars/yen/euros/gold to take advantage of price fluctuations you're doing the same.

Sure, but remember reddit works in mobs, it's not easy to back them out of a dead end, especially if they find a witch.

This is what I don't understand: wouldn't certain regulation for entities that hold coins be better for everyone but those entities? I especially wouldn't mind regulations that make them federally insured (along with the regulations for a standard of security that would be required to manage the risk).
I generally like to pit the incompetence of man against his greed and lust for power. It undermines his greed and lust for power with incompetence and undermines his incompetence with motivation, slightly diminishing both rather than having them reak havok somewhere else. I don't believe regulation in an of itself is guaranteed to be wrong, that there are opportunities to harness "evil and incompetence, enshrined in an authority".
Regulation can be like nuclear power, turning something that is almost wholly dangerous into something useful. 
That said, I know this isn't going to be a popular opinion here, to say the least. I just had to get it off my chest.

Federally insured by the federal government is what I was thinking. Fair point about how they would have to give me dollars for the bitcoins if anything went wrong, but that's how a lot of insurance works.

Encouraging recklessness is just foolish. The damage is rarely limited to just the person doing it.

The start and end of it is adoption. No currency can be stable if it's only sporadically used in special settings.
