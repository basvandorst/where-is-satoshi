Very secure, you can have an online machine and offline machine for signing. But you need to run core and have a copy of the blockchain yourself.

You are wrong. Look at the charts here:  
The country with the fastest average connection speed is South Korea with a value of 20.5 Mb/s. USA comes in at 14th place with an average of 12.6 Mb/s.
Looking at average peaks, Singapore does pretty well at 135 Mb/s, and the USA comes in at 16th place with 57.3 Mb/s. But of course by definition peaks are outliers so you cannot rely on them.

Actually what Satoshi said was rather ambiguous. When he made that statement nodes were also miners, so it isn't clear whether he is referring to mining or to validating nodes or both.
Regardless of what Satoshi intended, a decentralized network implies as many heterogenous participants as possible which can best be achieved by balancing blockchain size with transaction throughput. Bearing in mind that multi layered approaches are also possible.

Ironically I used to buy tons of stuff on Humble Bundle, because they offered Linux games and I could pay with Bitcoin. If I found a game I wanted on Steam I would go to Humble Store and buy it there.  
Now the situation is reversed - only a minority of Humble Bundle games run on Linux, and if I want to pay with Bitcoin I can do so on Steam. So if I see a game I want in the Humble Store I will purchase it on Steam instead.
 
@_date: 2016-08-25 10:25:19
IIRC, blocks are only checked after the latest checkpoint, so if you are using the latest version of bitcoind it shouldnt matter too much.

I think that is only true for blocks since the latest checkpoint. Blocks before the checkpoint don't need to be verified so CPU use should be lower.

I don't get....it claims to be a patent application, yet when you read it it talks about trademarking various names, e.g. "Bitcoin Technology", then it goes on to claim exclusive rights over the word Bitcoin.

Upgrading software is relatively easy. I've been running Linux kernels since 1998. Yeah if you run Windows (or worse OSX) it might be a little more tricky but then if you can' t upgrade your OS you are probably not cut out to run a bitcoin node anyway.

I doubt there were ever more than a handful of people with &gt; 40,000 coins...maybe some of the very early miners. The Winkelvii are supposed to have 100K coins.

Nobody needs to "decide". Just pick a random block from the month before the release.
@_date: 2016-08-27 06:47:58
Yes correct, I thought it was 1.5 years.

I've done plenty of cross platform coding. You just need libusb + whatever the equivalent is on Windows / OSX + sockets and a cross platform GUI like gtk, qt or wx widgets. You could even write it in python for example and probably not even have to worry about the underlying layers (use pip install for example to install python-usb). Maybe slightly harder than writing a chrome app, but it's not rocket science.
@_date: 2016-08-27 00:22:46
Oh yeah that's another thing...Moore's Law is dead for CPU speeds. 10 years ago the fastest CPU you could buy was about 3.5 GHz. Today the fastest CPU you can buy is still about 3.5 GHz. Where is my 10GHz CPU, my 50GHz CPU ? If Moores Law still held, today I could buy a 200 GHz processor. Same with RAM sizes...10 years ago 2 GB was standard. So today we should have machines with 128GB RAM as standard, right ?

Hey that's not fair.  
They also have a machinegun at the end of the runway.
@_date: 2016-08-26 00:35:18
No, the blocksize is related to the number of transactions made, not to the value of those transactions.
@_date: 2016-08-26 00:09:32
Maybe. Speaking from personal experience I just bought a new top of the range laptop though and I am hoping it will last me more than 3 years. Also if the blockchain is growing so fast that you need a new machine to handle it, most likely you would need to upgrade your internet connection too. In many places thats not so easy.
Also I feel it shouldn't be a case of always needing the latest greatest hardware, it should be enough so that if you have a top of the range machine at one point, you can still run it when the machine is a bit crappy (but not too much).
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:22:49
I think you mean: Bitcoin hodlers not affected.

Bitcoin isn't really suitable for instant payments, unless you use a payment processor (like Bitpay). Whoever told you otherwise was lying.
@_date: 2016-08-26 00:13:47
It's more of a feeling than anything else. 10 years feels like any machine would be quite antiquated, but 6 or 7 years it feels like a machine would still be just about acceptable but somewhat outdated. 2 - 3 years feels like you would be constantly having to run a top of the range machine.

@_date: 2016-08-26 03:52:31
How so ? If you use checkpoints you don't need to verify any transactions up to the checkpointed block.
@_date: 2016-08-01 09:39:56
In the long term the delay wont matter. What will matter though is that segwit was well tested and developed before being implemented, and that a hasty hardfork was avoided.

I have such a setup, but having to replace things every 2-3 years would be a real pain, financially and technically. A working node should last at least 5 years without needing replacing, 6 - 7 years would be about the sweet spot IMO.

@_date: 2016-08-03 03:10:08
I read earlier that all the attacker's transactions were to a normal BFX address plus one of his own addresses. My guess is that the attacker somehow made his own address look like a change address and fooled th bitgo limit checks. Just a guess though.

@_date: 2016-08-03 09:39:33
Presumably bfx and bitgo had a direct connection, avoiding cloudfare. cloudfare is only used on the public side to avoid ddos attacks. Also signing with a private key doesn't mean you have to send the private key - that is the whole point of signing. bfx would have sent unsigned tx to bitgo, bitgo would have signed them and then sent them back.
@_date: 2016-04-09 11:17:53
The Core Roadmap specifically mentions implementing dynamic block sizing at some point, so there could be something like flexcap which would allow for the spam attack to be contained in blocks at some cost to the miners.
@_date: 2016-08-20 12:42:17

@_date: 2016-08-27 06:42:39


If you like, provided you pick a block from the longest valid chain. Also the block should be at least 2000 blocks old.


Yes, it does this by enforcing a simple rule: the longest valid chain wins. There is no such thing as "a minority consensus" (barring reorgs, which is why the extra 2000 block rule).

@_date: 2018-01-04 19:16:35
Unfortunately LN won't help you there since you will first have to transfer the BTC to a payment channel. On the other hand once your BTC is in the channel you can convert to your other coin without using an exchange or paying exchange fees (provided your other coin also supports payment channels.).

@_date: 2018-01-21 04:17:10
That's debatable - for sure some of the Bitcoin price is due to speculation, but the price has also risen due to an increase in utility, awareness and acceptance of the coin. For alt coins, the price is pretty much only driven by speculation. If you bought Bitcoin any time prior to the last month or so, you are in profit now.

I'd like to see a scaling solution ASAP also, believe me I have a lot of money invested in bitcoin, and I want to see it succeed. But I'm waiting to see what the devs (other than Gavin and Mike) decide is best first. If they say BIP 101 then so be it, but I think it's a trap which causes block sizes to be too big after a few years and willl almost certainly lead to centralized nodes.

I'd be fine with a 20 cent transaction fee to use the blockchain. But since the price of a coin varies, how would one translate a dollar price into bitcoin ? Some altcoins have systems like this to track the value of various commodities, but they rely on trusted "oracles" to input the current price of various commodities. But then the problem becomes, who chooses the trusted oracle(s), and how do you ensure they don't game the system for their own benefit ?
Also, as you point out, in order to replace the current subsidy you either need several orders of magnitude more transactions, or much higher transaction fees. I for one would rather lean towards higher fees than more transactions. As others have noted it's possible to build a payments network on top of a settlement system, it's not possible to build a settlement system on top of a payments network.

@_date: 2015-12-23 13:20:21


The value of an individual coin has no relevance here, all that will happen is that the fee will go down in terms of bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-12-31 12:02:47
They most probably don't answer because you are creating a straw-man arrgument. Reluctance to raise block size is mostly due to potential NODE centralization. Mining centralization only applies to quite large blocks, and can be reduced via IBLTs and the bitcoin relay network to give two examples.
@_date: 2015-12-19 00:47:12

Obviously in your mind "scaling bitcoin" == "bip101", however that is not what it says.
@_date: 2015-12-19 09:55:01
Well, the free market may demand a lot of things which are inimical to the original design of bitcoin, for example removing the halving events, and centralizing mining. I presume you would be OK with that. However, since the wise devs are tasked with ensuring that bitcoin complies with its original design, Bitcoin probably isn't  for you.
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:55:30
This has absolutely nothing to do with 0-conf.
@_date: 2015-12-07 23:55:02
No, professor, we don't know. Everything you have written is speculation. The fact is, there is quite a large number of companies who want to put their data on the bitcoin blockchain, but they don't care too much about bitcoin as a currency. It is possible that they are holding back from doing so in the hope that the block size will be increased via BIP101, and then they will start filling blocks with their data. In an efficient market (from the data sender's point of view), there would be exactly the correct number of transactions between them to fill and just fill every block. Any fewer transactions, and block space is wasted, any more transactions and the fees go up.  Note also that implementing Segregated Witness along with increasing the block size to 2MB is roughly equivalent in terms of transaction space to increasing the block size to 10MB without SW.
Regarding your last point, I believe there is a limit to block size above which the number of validating nodes shrinks (actually, it's not quite that simple but I´ll come to that in a moment), whereby as you state, the "death rate" of nodes outstrips the "birth rate". But I think below this limit, the birth rate can actually be higher, since as bitcoin scales (via smaller block increases + SW + whatever else) then there are more stakeholders who are motivated to run validating nodes. As I mentioned, it is not that simple, because the same can be said if the block size limit is increased a la BIP101; however in this case the new nodes will most likely be from well funded organizations (banks and other companies who can afford lots of bandwidth and storage). In the preferable case there is a greater diversity of nodes, including many home users as we have currently.
 
@_date: 2015-12-17 23:06:01


I am not trying to censor anything. You pay the fee, you can put whatever you like in blockchain (as long as it looks like a valid transaction). But who are you to tell me "I demand that you download and store bigger blocks, because I claim the right to put my (non bitcoin financial) information in the bitcoin blockchain WITHOUT PAYING A HIGHER FEE".

Peter also ignores IBLT and other possible future developments which allow miners to reduce the orphan risk. The effect would be to push the equation in favour of larger blocks with a resulting increase in resource consumption by nodes.

@_date: 2015-12-22 15:47:44
It's incorrect to say that blocks are nearly at capacity: [graph]( average block fill is still around 65 - 70 %, so there is clearly no need to panic yet.
Also SW wasnt just pulled from a hat, apparently it has been discussed since 2011, but recent developments have improved it.
But I guess at this point you are just trolling.

No. I said it breaks (or at least strongly affects) that theory.


Transactions can be verified as they are received, and with IBLTs you are just signalling which ones are included in the block. So that's not really a valid argument either.

b) ~~Hiring a botnet to DDoS full nodes works much better if you increase the maximum blocksize first.~~ OK, I realise you are talking about a bandwidth DDoS.  I guess that is true. But just because there are easier attacks, I don't think that means we should stop concerning ourselves.

Peter Wiule is working SW right now, so it should be released in the next few months. LN is awaiting 3 more BIPs which should be in core within about 4 months. Add on another 6 months to complete testing (there are 3 implementations which are partially tested), and we should have LN in under a year. Those timeframes all seem pretty reasonable to me.
@_date: 2015-12-23 12:33:27
Sorry my bad - it seems 4MB would be the total (roughly) including witness data and the tx block. So yes you are correct with your numbers. I don't see it as adding "kludgy code, complexity, security, and an artificial sense of relief " - what is kludgy about it (apart from implementing it as a soft fork ?). It certainly doesnt increase complexity or security (nodes can still check each tx block as it is produced) and the relief it provides in increasing the number of tx is real (the 2.5 multplier effect remains no matter what the block size);
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:59:22

@_date: 2015-06-30 21:51:12
That is a very valid point, and it's one of the main reasons why I personally find fault with Gavin's proposal. It seems to take the lazy way out by simply increasing block sizes and dodging the issue, In addition I believe that long-term (10 - 20 years out) the block sizes he (Gavin) proposes could very well be harmful to bitcoin as a decentralized network.
@_date: 2015-06-10 11:21:06
There wont be a fork. Large blocks will only be enabled when &gt; 80% of the last blocks were created by XT. If 80% of the mining power is running XT then their fork will very quickly become the longest chain. The other 20% will have to switch over quickly or risk being sidelined on a much less secure chain.

@_date: 2015-06-30 22:41:36
Well if it comes down a choice between cheap transaction fees and centralization, and higher transaction fees and decentralization then the latter is always preferable.  
For example, in the former case, you could save on transaction fees but end up having to pay a fee to do SPV lookups. Not to mention the loss of privacy and systemic and political risks due to increased centralization.
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:47:22

@_date: 2015-06-23 23:38:00
Surely you could add it with a big warning saying something like "Warning ! By clicking this you accept that none of the addresses in this wallet have ever been used, and any coins sent to this wallet up to the present time will be unspendable until you run a full scan.".
I think it will be a very well received feature. It is very annoying at the moment. Every time I create a new wallet on my offline machine and load it in to my online machine as a watch only, it scans the entire blockchain. Every single time. For each wallet, one at a time. Even though I know for sure the wallet addresses have never been used. It's painful.
I think you will need to do something like this in the future anyway if armory ever starts using a pruned blockchain. The transactions simply wont be there on the hardrive to be scanned any longer.
@_date: 2015-12-17 23:10:55
Sorry, but decentralization and censorship resistance are way more important than having a big market share.
@_date: 2015-06-10 00:11:28
Oh sure they can. Just that somebody might be willing to pump up the fee market to produce such large blocks that it would effectively end decentralisation in bitcoin.

I don't know all the technical details of node discovery, but suppose an attacker could fill the network with bad nodes. These nodes only tell you about other bad peers. So imagine there is one good node and 100 bad nodes. The chance of you connecting to that one good node is very small (unless you know beforehand the IP of the good node) because the bad nodes won't tell you about it.  The more 'good' nodes there are on the network the more difficult it becomes to pull off an attack like this.
@_date: 2015-06-09 13:20:44


They will do anyway, or do you imagine 20MB blocks will be all we need, ever ?
@_date: 2015-12-07 22:25:56
Exactly. And of course it is obvious that if blocks are so large that they knock out some full nodes, then those nodes no longer have a vote. So only the nodes which are OK with large block sizes have the voting power.  
So if the miners dont agree, and the remaining nodes don't care, then we have a big problem.

I would assume that once the halvings become important enough to in isolation cause the hashrate to completely halve, that we would have a mature enough fee market that the halvings wouldn't matter so much anyway.

How is it a trick if it requires less storage and / or network ? I could set up my node to not store / download witness blocks, and we could have up to 5 times the current transactions without any increase in my storage or bandwidth requirements.

My own opinion is that that is irrelevant, a few years out the increase becomes trivial percentage wise anyway. I think it's more likely that there will be another hardfork some years down the line to increase the growth rate and add a final cap. It will be easier to see this having more hard data about adoption rates and technological improvements.

Where is the flaw ? Things are working exactly as they should be.


I really don't care about whether every single coffee I pay for is on the blockchain or on some other related ledger. What I care about most is having the ability to run a full node on standard hardware, and being able to transact on the blockchain when I need to for a reasonable but not necessarily minimal fee. It is nothing to do with "deserving" it's about ensuring decentralisation and using resources in an efficient way.
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:19:25
It would be if it was natural organic growth, nobody would be happier than me. But what if you switch on 20MB blocks and the next day we find that blocks are being filled up to 20MB with blockchain spam ? People would be calling for an immediate upgrade to 40MB blocks, and so on.  
Until we get there nobody can say with certainty what will happen, but we should plan for worst case scenarios.

There are plenty of alts which work like this. People are free to go and use one.  Projects don't always need roadmaps, many of the best projects work without them but simply adapt as they grow. In particular, projects which are so important (like financial projects) should avoid strong leaders, since they can easily be corrupted, mislead etc, in order to favour one group over another.


If the cost of keeping bitcoin decentralised means I have to trust a third party with a few dollars I think that's a small price to pay. 


Principally, yes. Large doesn't have to be huge though. A transaction fee of a dollar or two would be ideal in my vision.

Why do you say "pretend" ? As far as I can tell, it's part of an overall scaling solution. There is nothing "fake" about it, since it can effectively increase the number of transactions in a block without increasing the (transaction) block size.

Yes he is quite correct. However, one possible improvement is to use the median rather than mean average. Then an attacker has to have &gt; 51% hash power to carry this attack out.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:55:43
Yes, this is exactly what I suggested yesterday. 8MB initial size, with an increase of 20% per year. This gives a doubling time of roughly 4 years, so the reward halves, and the block size (and thus fees ?) double at the same time.
@_date: 2015-06-04 10:52:36
I'm more concerned about the up to 1 TB of storage required per year (even more if the block size is allowed to grow with time).
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:35:06


Sure, if it were just a one off change to keep things running smooth, but Gavin's change also introduces a doubling in size every 2 years, which has the potential to damage the bitcoin ecosystem even more.
@_date: 2015-06-23 08:32:36
I'm sorry but perhaps I am misunderstanding something. I am talking about the initial scan when a wallet is first added, not subsequent scans. It's just saying "up to now (the current latest block in the database now, when the wallet is first added) , there were no transactions". I don't see there is a need to trust anything.
@_date: 2015-06-07 04:39:06

"The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't **generate**."  
The word "generate" is odd here, is it possible he was referring to non-mining nodes ? If he had meant full nodes surely he would have used other language like "don't verify" or "don't download blocks".

Gavin is, it is right there in his XT code, and also in his BIP 101.
8MB in 2016 with doubling every 2 years. Which means in roughly 14 years the blocksize limit will be 1GB, and in 16 years 2GB.

Under Gavin's plan we will surpass 20MB block size max in around 3 years. Besides my point was that Gavin is talking about one situation in the video, whilst he pulled a bait-and-switch and put in the 2 year doubling at the last minute.

So you think every transaction for every cup of coffee should be recorded on the blockchain ?  
(It might not even be possible anyway; consider, if we raise the block size to 20MB, an attacker for 10 million USD per day can raise the transaction fee to $5. That's nothing for say, a central bank. Who would buy a coffee on the blockchain for a fee of $5 ?).
Basically we are going to need both blockchain and sidechains and payment channels. Blockchain for high fee large payments, sidechains, lightning for low fee micro payments.

@_date: 2015-06-05 01:36:52
Sounds like she thinks the blockchain itself is some magical technology. It's not. By itself it is just data with a timestamp.  What makes the bitcoin blockchain special is that it is decentralised and public. That such a blockchain is ideal for sound money is a nicety which makes it possible to reward the decentralised participants in a positive feedback loop.

If I might suggest, home connection speed has been constantly growing because people like to do lots of things up to and including stream video. There is no guarantee that bandwidth will keep growing for ever, in fact growth may slow down or even stop when it gets "good enough" for most people. You can see this effect if you look at CPU speeds. We have added more cores, but CPU speed isn't doubling every 2 years any more. Current speeds are fast enough for most people, they just want to read their mail, chat on facebook and play a few games.  
Actually the more concerning thing for me is looking at blockchain sizes assuming all blocks are full. 16MB blocks require 1 TB per year, and of course this is cumulative, so after 2 years with 40% growth you require 2.4 TB total. After 4 years we reach about 8TB total. And of course this goes up exponentially. By the time we reach 16GB blocks in 20 years, the blockchain could be almost 2000 TB in size and growing at around 840 TB per year.

Naturally. Nobody knows the future, which was my point :D


Correct, however the advantage is that 1) it would become immediately obvious to everyone that no matter how large we made the block size, blocks would immediately be filled to the limit. 2) it would be better to discover this without actually increasing the block size, than by increasing it and then discovering it.




I wouldn't be opposed to that as a solution, but then there is the problem of how to determine the minimum fee level - I could see this as being just as contentious as the block size debate (in actual fact, it IS the block size debate, just via another parameter...). I am pretty sure there would be one side arguing for .01 cent transaction fees, and another side arguing for $10 transaction fees...

@_date: 2015-06-20 01:30:58
Thanks for that. If I understand correctly what you are saying then it does seem reasonable. However I found this interesting:
"For instance, if Coinbase had
contracts with 80% of the Bitcoin hashing power to guarantee their
transactions would get mined, but 20% of the hashing power didn't sign
up, then the only way to guarantee their transactions could be for the
80% to not build on blocks containing doublespends by the 20%. There's
no way in a decentralized network to come to consensus about what
transactions are or are not valid without mining itself, so you could
end up in a situation where unless you're part of one of the big pools
you can't reliably mine at all because your blocks may get rejected for
containing doublespends.
One of my goal with standard replace-by-fee is to prevent this scenario
by forcing merchants and others to implement ways of accepting zeroconf
transactions safely that work in a decentralized environment regardless
of what miners do; we have a stronger and safer Bitcoin ecosystem if
we're relying on math rather than trust to secure our zeroconf
IMO the best way to avoid this kind of thing would be for Coinbase or whoever to sign their own transactions with a known key (assuming that is possible) and then let the merchants decide if they want to accept those zeroconf payments. POS systems could be programmed specifically for this. Then it doesnt need to involve the miners at all.
And yes RBF FSS does seem like a better alternative. I wonder if miners could be held legally liable if it could be somehow proved that they did non FSS RBF and it led to somebody losing money. I wonder if f2pool have considered that.

It's actually the only way to do it securely if you think about it. You have to prove your balance by showing where the coins came from - otherwise a miner could just invent an address with 1000 bitcoins in it and then spend them.

Yes. And the worst possible solution is to remove the blocksize limit completely or to grow it aggressively as some have suggested.
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:59:31
That's exactly correct. But there are 2 possibilities under an attack scenario:  
- block sizes increase hugely (in the no / high block size limit scenario)  
- tx fees increase hugely (limited block size)  
I believe the latter of these is preferable. If / when the attack stops or is deflected, fees would eventually return to normal levels. So the damage is temporary. With the former, the blockchain bloat is permanent.

I have asked this before but never received a decent reply.  
You broadcast your transaction to that "one good node". Then what happens ?

Sure it does, but with a bit slower automatic increase. We still have about a year anyway until we hit the 1MB limit, a little more time to get things right wouldn't hurt.

I don't know....support is one thing....but the level of vitriolic nastiness we have seen, the constant downvotes, and the near censorship of anything which disagrees with "big blocks are great yeah", just seems...odd. You can also tell when there is an organised campaign going on, because supposedly unrelated people start making the same (untrue / unprovable) points. For example, I have seen several distinct people make claims like "devs opposed to big blocks all havent made a case against them", "devs opposed to big blocks resort to ad hominem attacks on Gavin". Also, yes if you read this sub you would get the impression that 99% of the world supports a hard fork, but I don't think that is quite the case in reality.

Miners might be able to handle huge blocks, but most full nodes probably not.

@_date: 2015-12-18 23:53:26
Yes sorry, you are probably correct on that point. But in any case that should be sufficient for at least the next year, maybe longer. I understand Peter Wiule is working on it right now and as it's a soft fork it should be quite straightforward to roll out.

They are somewhat, surely ? If it takes forever to sync, you can't run a full node. Also, if you were to combine SW with IBLT maybe you would only need the transaction block ?

What makes you think these guys aren't bad actors ?
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:14:56
That would be the most ineffective way to shut down a bitcoin address. You could just load the private key in another wallet software.
@_date: 2015-06-27 13:53:49
Sorry I dont get your point. My point is that the number of SPV servers is orders of magnitude less than the number of full nodes, which makes them easier to control. Therefore any plan for block size increases should err on the side of encouraging people to run full nodes rather than SPV servers.  
I have made the point several times that Gavin's plan with a max block size doubling time of 2 years would push people firmly into the SPV camp whereas a more relaxed increase (doubling every 3 or 4 years) would IMO be sufficient to keep people running full nodes.
@_date: 2015-06-18 01:27:02
8MB is fine. Why would we need to go to 20MB in one jump, just because Gavin says so ?

US only. Useless for me.
@_date: 2015-06-27 13:49:24
Oh I agree. We need far more than 6000 nodes, and it will happen, but only if block size is allowed to grow more slowly than network bandwidth and disk storage. That is why I would prefer Gavin's plan with a doubling time of 3 or even better 4 years, rather than the 2 years he has specified. In that case you would likely see the number of nodes growing over time, with his current proposal my feeling is that it would push people to use SPV nodes which are orders of magnitude fewer in number.

Nodes also serve a useful purpose to filter out invalid transactions before they hit the miners. Without enough nodes it could be possible to DOS the miners by sending loads of invalid transactions from different points on the network.
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:48:42
Hmm lets see, a tps of 4000 would imply approximately 1.5GB block size. Which in turn would require 75 TB of data storage per year. At current prices you would need to pay something like $10,000 - $20,000 per year for the privilege of running a full node.  
I think we need to find another solution.

Perhaps. Who knows in 10 years if there will still be mining pools. Network banning of course relies on a majority of nodes being in favour of the ban, etc.
I don't pretend to have perfect knowledge. There may be some reason in the future why blocks would be more full than now. Can you guarantee that wont happen ? Of course not. Just because we don't know what it is doesn't mean it won't happen. Why risk losing something as important as decentralisation of nodes when we could take simple measures now to ensure that problems are minimised ?
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:28:22
OK, but the point still stands. By the time that happens fees should be a far greater proportion of mining revenue such that the reward drop will hardly matter.

@_date: 2015-06-24 13:54:41
I tested the app (with testnet coins) a few days ago, it looks pretty good but there were still a few bugs that needed ironing out. For example the app managed to somehow loose a fraction of a test coin when I cancelled some transactions. Also it doesn't show you how much you have in escrow, which would be nice to know. Due to lack of buyers/sellers online I wasnt able to fully test it, but it seems like it is coming on, but still quite buggy.

The reason is not stupidity. Many people assume that if the space is there in the blockchain it will be used, not necessarily by bitcoin transactions. 
The same way building more roads rarely reduces congestion in the long term. Eventually it just encourages more traffic to use the new roads.
@_date: 2015-12-14 18:14:27
Well I don't know the implementation details, but obviously *some* nodes will want to download and store the sig blocks. Also newly synced nodes won't have the sig data in memory so they will need a sig block to validate the tx block.
@_date: 2015-06-21 11:58:13
According to my back of the envelope calculations based on current data, 8GB blocks will require a dedicated 700Mb link and if blocks are 50% full then it will require 500TB storage per year.

Your error is in assuming growth requires a corresponding increase in block size.
@_date: 2015-06-01 11:07:16
Agreed. But even better is to plan it well ahead of time so that the necessary hard fork can be introduced smoothly.
@_date: 2015-06-04 01:15:04
Too easy to game the system. An attacker can just flood the system with more and more dust transactions. Or just pay a miner to keep producing larger and larger blocks. Since there is no upper limit to blocksize, this can go on indefinitely.
@_date: 2015-06-11 13:30:16
To clarify I should have said 20MB _right away_. I'm in favour of a smaller initial rise + 20% increase per year. What about you ?
@_date: 2015-06-10 04:18:23
Sure there are. But just because it's easier for a thief to climb in the window, doesn't mean we shouldn't also lock the back door (or something...you get my drift...)
@_date: 2015-12-07 21:22:23


Well, imagine you are catching up and catching up....but then the block size increases, and now you start falling behind again, because you don't have enough bandwidth to load 6 blocks per hour any more, so you can never get up to current.  
 With SW the blocks are smaller so you could still continue catching up until you are fully synched.  I.E. the limit to synch is basically the same as the limit to run a synched node.
So the bandwidth limit / cutoff to be able to synch is lower.
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:02:16
Does Gavin still support a 40% per year increase ?
@_date: 2015-06-04 07:21:09
a) They could pay a miner a sum of X USD rather than BTC to include a load of zero-fee transactions.
b) The aim of the attacker would be to increase the blockchain size in order to reduce the number of full nodes. This is either the aim of the attack itself (increasing centralisation) or it then enables stage 2 of the attack which is for the attacker to run their own nodes and get a majority running their own version of the code.
@_date: 2015-06-02 17:53:25
Maybe, if, you think,....I am not interested in that, I am analysing Gavin's original suggestion from an engineering viewpoint.


The network as a whole may be richer, but that does not mean that the individuals who want to run nodes will all be rich. I thought the aim was to have as many validating nodes as possible ? It needs to be designed such that the average internet user can afford to run a node with some minimal outlay.
Personally, I believe that blocks will always fill to near capacity. If you disagree, then presumably it doesnt matter if we have a less aggressive increment, because blocks will be nowhere near capacity anyway.
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:03:48


Im in favour of raising the limit, but I am against doubling it every 2 years. You see, not everything is binary as people are trying to make out.


They support an increase to 8MB blocks. There was nothing in there about doubling the limit every 2 years. In fact Gavin seems to have pulled a classic bait-and-switch.


Fishiness on both sides if you ask me.
@_date: 2015-06-11 20:22:50

Well, somebody already put a virus signature in there. So the blockchain will forever set off anti virus warnings.
@_date: 2015-06-02 10:03:35
There is no guarantee either that the UTXO set will remain small. In fact it is quite easy for an attacker to game the UTXO with dust transactions so that it becomes relatively useless.  
Of course yes it is possible to save space using it, but it will also grow over time. My analysis here is for a worst-case scenario. Are you willing to risk Bitcoin's decentralisation on the expectation that the UTXO set will remain small ?
@_date: 2015-12-22 13:01:20

Sorry, I jumped a logical step - the miners presumably will follow what a majority of nodes do (i.e. they wont start producing BIP 101 blocks if a majority of nodes will reject those blocks).  
There was also a thing a few months ago where people were spoofing nodes to try to influence the debate in this way. So the logic is:  
- people run many fake/temporary nodes with bitcoin XT  
- majority of miners see this and switch on BIP 101  
- fake/temporary nodes are switched off and now a majority of nodes reject big blocks  
- the majority of miners switch back to small blocks, leaving a minority of miners and nodes supporting BIP 101

Good luck to you. I imagine as the blockchain grows more and more people will come to rely on SPV servers and you will be able to run it as a business and charge say an annual fee for lookups. Actually you might even be forced to in order to prevent your server from being flooded with requests.  
Gavin's current plan is pretty bad for privacy / decentralisation but pretty good for those who manage to maintain SPV servers.

They may have agreed to an increase to 8MB, but they notably did not agree to further increases beyond that. Gavin's BIP includes a constantly increasing maximum so it could well be that they come out against the new proposal for that reason.

No, like I said, I agree we cannot assume that fees will ever replace 100% of the peak subsidy. But let's say they can eventually replace 10% of the peak. Mining income would go down by a factor of 10, but it would be over several years so there would be time to adjust.

The difference is, mining is rewarded, running a full node isnt (at least in financial terms). So anything at all which discourages running of full nodes must be avoided.

But it is not static, it reduces over time, halving every 4 years. If it were static there would be no need to replace it. It may well be that fees will never replace 100% of the *peak* mining subsidy, in which case the hash rate will adjust downwards until we reach equilibrium again. But due to technology improvements, the hashrate will probably actually increase over the long term anyway, despite small blips at the halving events.

I wish I knew the answer to that. Perhaps nodes should reject full blocks where the average fee is below some limit and there is some percentage of higher fee transactions waiting in memory. That would encourage miners to include high fee transactions in the blocks and stop corrupt miners from producing spam filled blocks.  That wouldnt entirely fix the problem but it would be a good start. (If we see this kind of behaviour ocurring).

As I said, bandwidth is not my main concern, hd storage is. Do the calculations for 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years out, assuming (worst case) full blocks and a block size increase of 40% p.a and you will see what the problem is.
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:42:11
My preferred solution is to go to 8MB blocks straight away, plus an automatic 20% increase per year.

Once 20MB blocks start to get full, 30GB won't even last you 2 weeks.
@_date: 2015-06-10 00:22:49
1) Somebody (eg central bank), pays a large miner to add an increasing number of transactions to each block.  
2) Blocks grow.  
3) Larger blocks need more diskspace / network.  
4) Less people can afford to run nodes  
5) Less nodes = more centralisation

I am guessing what will happen is, if XT approaches the 80% limit then there will be a rush by the other nodes to switch over, since nobody will want to be on the minor fork (with 20% *or less* of the total hash power). In game theory you could model it as an inverse Tragedy of the Commons. So probably something like 70% would be enough to tip the remaining 30% to switch over.

Well let's assume either:

2) they buy on a chinese exchange - yuan moves from one chinese account to another, or
3) they buy on a western exchange; in this case they must already have a euro or dollar account, dollars or euros move from one euro/dollar account to another
None of these situations affect the amount of yuan in the country.
Compare this to:
chinese person sells yuan and buys dollars at a currency exchange. In this case yes, the value of yuan is affected, as the exchange must buy more dollars with yuan to replenish their stock.

The figures are meaningless unless you also know the number of addresses at each level. For example, suppose 10 wallets each with 100 coins and 1 with 1000.

Hmmm...there are some odd concepts to understand, like "proving False". But I am kind of getting there I think.
I added an edit to my comment, but I guess you missed it, so here it is again:
I changed "let x y be given." to just "let x y." and then it worked. The confusion arises because in some of the proof examples, things are specified more verbosely: e.g "Let x and y be given.", but in the proof scripts themselves you need to write exactly "let x y." (Note also in the scripts we need to start with a lower case letter).
Now I have been thinking how this can be made easier: e.g. it should be possible to take the examples, and paste them directly into the textboxes and have them check out correctly. The solution I propose is to allow comments (denoted by a " in the textboxes. This would allow for better explanations. For instance, now in the example you could say "let x y. # Let x y be given." So now pasting this into the script box would not produce an error (since everything after the # is ignored). Likewise I find it would be very useful to be able to annotate the proofs, e.g:
assume H1: A. # here we assume that we have a proof of A.  
 # need to prove B here: I will come back to it later  
prove C.  
 # need to prove D.  
What do you think of this suggestion ?
BTW, now I get different error with my attempt 2, above:
Prove ∀x y : A, x = y → y = x
let x y.  
assume H1: x = y.  
prove y = x.  
rewrite the current goal using H1 (left to right) at position 2.  
prove y = y. exact (eql y).  
Qed.  
Syntax Error: Syntax error: expected rewrite &lt;pftrm&gt; at &lt;posints&gt;. Again this was a confusion between the examples and the script checker. I changed "rewrite the current goal using H1 (left to right) at position 2." to just "rewrite H1 at 2." and that was OK.
But, I now get a new error: Failure: rewrite tactic cannot be used without &lt;- until symmetry of equality is known.
Don't see why I need to prove that, as I am using "x=y" in the rewrite, not "y=x".
Finally, what is wrong here ?:
Prove ∀x y z : A, x = y → y = z → x = z 
let x y z.  
assume H1: x=y.  
assume H2: y=z.  
prove x=z.  
rewrite H1 at 1.  
prove y=z.  
rewrite H2 at 1.  
prove z=z.  
exact (eqI z).  
Qed.  
Result: Your proof is correct but does not correspond to the declared treasure.

That's not what people mean generally when they use the phrase "backed by gold". They mean it more in the sense that the coin becomes a kind of certificate to show that you stored gold with a third party (which is what paper money was originally - actually gold or silver certificates).
If you just want to buy or sell gold with bitcoin you can do that already.

Now to answer your first question - I have considered this myself. I feel the best way may be to grab a live USB of Ubuntu say, and add the packages for offline armory.
In the offline armory, create one or more paper wallets.
Install a full armory on the machine, load in copies of the paper wallets as watching only wallets. Boot up with USB to sign transactions if you want to spend from cold storage.
Or a simpler way - burn a live USB, and download the code from bitaddress.org. Generate a random passphrase and write it down. Use the passphrase to create an address and just send coins to there. You wont be able to spend the coins unless you sweep them into another wallet though.

More people get interested in BTC, but they don't buy straight away - instead the money waits on the sidelines. Then eventually the price rises enough that people think they will miss out if they don't buy NOW, So the price rises further as the money on the sidelines comes in. This process is self reinforcing until the price goes hyperbolic, at which point profits are taken and the bubble crashes, overshooting to the downside.
At least that is what I observed during the last 2 bubbles.

OK, lets say somebody (e.g. Tim Draper) wants to build up a substantial amount of coins. He can buy them at auction, or he can buy them on an exchange. If he buys say 100,000 coins on an exchange, the price could for example reach 10K per coin.  
Or he can buy them at an auction.  Now we know there were 11 bidders and 27 bids. So there is at least some amount of competition. Even paying substantially above "market price" is still cheaper then trying to buy those coins on an exchange. They are not paying more than they could elsewhere, because of the amount of coins they are buying in one shot. You don't get a discount in bulk, because bitcoin is a scarce item, any more than you would get a discount in bulk for buying say 3 Faberge eggs at an auction.  
I don't know how much simpler I can explain it.

@_date: 2014-04-28 21:19:45
I was thinking about just such a thing the other day.
850,000 coins at first sight seems a lot. But consider - suppose there are several instituions which want to buy in (banks, hedge funds, wealthy individuals, even governments). Now let's say each of those groups wants to buy around 20,000 btc (I just made that up, but bear with me).
Now this means, over the year, approximately 40 such groups can hit their target number of coins. Next year a similar number, and in 2016, about half that (until the block reward halving). I.e. given the assumptions, this is 100 such groups. Then we get the block halving. Over the following 4 years (2016 - 2019) there will be enough coins mined to allow another 100 such groups. The remainder of coins (enough for another 100 or so such groups) will be mined over the next 120 years.
So: there are approximately enough btc left to be mined for 300 big whales. Of those 300; - 100 will be mined in the next 2.5 years, 100 in the 4 years following that, and the remaining 100 over the next 120 years.
The figures change if you alter how much a "whale" wants - if they want say 50,000 coins, then the figures become: 120 such whales, 40 in the next 2.5 years, 40 more in the following 4 years, and 40 more in the rest of time.
tl; dr: mined coins will only support a few whales, and long term the price is up !

@_date: 2014-12-27 22:02:02
No, the point is, it did happen. 30K + coins were sold at $300 in a few hours. To dismiss that as meaningless is ridiculous. The second point is that since then the price has never dipped below $300 again.  
If the price goes below $300 and stays there then I will agree that it was a meaningless occurence. But until then it marks a very strong bottom at a psychologically significant price.

No, the problem is that bitcoin-qt generates a new change address (key) each transaction. And only 100 of these are generated in advance.
I.e. Each address in your wallet has its own key.
@_date: 2014-04-23 23:28:12
Not always, because the format inside the wallet (the way the keys are stored) is always different depending on the client. But I think some are standardised so you can sometimes import from one client to another.

Bitcoin is an "internet currency".  
How about, when you purchase alcohol in the bitcoin boulevard, the payment actually goes to a shop in another state, which when receiveing the payment, simply authorises the storefront in the boulevard to ship "deliver" the alcohol to the customer (who may well happen to be in the storefront location at the time).

The word "deposits" isn't even mentioned in the google translation.
Also it seems to affect one bank only (CMB).
So a more honest / accurate title mght be "BTCChina halts account recharging from one bank".

Think who the earliest investors ARE, how they discovered bitcoin, how they obtained it, and why. There is your answer.  






Price and volatility surely ARE related. If the current price is too far from the true value, then it will try to correct, overshoot, pull back, etc. Also a higher price makes deliberate manipulation more difficult. And finally (perhaps) at a higher price any random "noise" movements become proportionally less relevant.  








That was a typo, I meant to say "falling PRICE". Obviously what you say is true, but a commodity with a falling price cannot by definition be a store of value (short term), however a commodity with a stable or rising price can be.

Obelisk is an open API/data server for the blockchain. So for example, you could send it queries like "what was the BTC balance of address X on date Y" and it should respond with the correct information.
@_date: 2014-07-27 17:36:30
Thanks for your reply. I actually deleted my comment because I realised i made an obvious error, in fact you note that my first assumption was the very thing I was trying to prove !
My second attempt is this:
assume H1: A /\ A.  
prove A. exact (andEL A A H1).  
Which gives the result: Your proof is correct but does not correspond to the declared treasure.
Also reading your response, you say "When you write "prove X", the X should be a proposition, not a proof.". I am not clear what the difference is between the two things (proposition and proof), despite having tried to follow the videos several times. Surely if we are trying to prove a proof, then the proof we are trying to prove is a proposition ? 
BTW: I note in the video, something very odd - you seem to be using circular logic, for example: assume H: A, ... something..., prove A, exact H.  Is it really valid to do that ?
Edit: here is another way I am trying to prove A /\ A -&gt; A, but still I get an error:
assume H1: B = A.  
assume H2: A /\ B -&gt; A.  
prove H2. exact (andEL A B).  
apply H1 to H2.  
Qed.  
I get error: Failure: Unknown term B -- it might be a proof in the position where a term is expected. 
Fair enough I guess, H1 is not really an assumption, it is a substitution, I suppose a function which replaces B with A in a proof, and B only appears in H2, not in the target. This is frustrating, what I am trying to say is "we know that A /\ B -&gt; A for all B (from andEL), and A is just a special case of all B, so therefore A /\ A -&gt; A". Now how would I say that in this obscure script ?

OK, I missed that. Is that the one which is labelled "what is bitcoin" on your site ? I had assumed that would be more about bitcoin in general.
But anyway, the video clip is fine for somebody like me who has some technical knowledge,but I think for more general users their eyes would just glaze over. Also you mention "instant confirmation" but again you don't explain how that works (which is a major selling point of the site....anybody can offer multi-sig wallets, but what you have unique is that you addresses can be *trusted* for sending.)
This is just a suggestion, not really about what i would prefer, but yeah...two people discussing the features like a Q and A, maybe with some animations showing how two keys are needed to send a transaction, how nlocktime works, how your greenaddresses can be trusted by merchants. Aim you explanation at a much less technical level and I think you will end up attracting a lot more new users.
@_date: 2014-08-26 11:10:44
I would say it really depends how you want to work with bitcoin. If it is on the business side then business/accounting/economics would be useful. If on the tech side then computer science with an emphasis on programming and crytpography and maybe some web design thrown in. Or you could study law and specialise in the legal side of cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:07:18
Correct, I was just trying to make the point - the Trezor *is* for walking around to buy stuff with. So while I agree the Pi is a great solution for cold storage, it's a different niche than the Trezor.
But the Trezor can also be used for cold storage, and for mainstream users its easier to just plug it in than to set up a Pi.
What's needed next is integration with exchanges - so you buy your BTC online, and they get downloaded straight away to the Trezor. E.g Bitsimple.

I'm talking about "paying to secure the network", not paying to have a transaction processed quickly.
Of course I am assuming that in the future there will be other reasons to send large BTC transfers than just the transaction cost alone.
And regarding a hard fork, this was tried last year and rolled back, but it is almost inevitable at some point the block size limit will need to be raised. Projections I have seen show that by early next year all block space will saturated if the 1MB limit is maintained.

i thought of something like this before. I believe it is possible in this way:
a) create a colored coin in address A    
b) a script* encrypts the data with public(A)   
c) you send the colored coin to address B   
d) right after sending, you transmit private(A) to the script, the data is decrypted and then encrypted with public(B)   
e) you send the coin to your friend's address C  
f)  right after sending, you transmit private(B) to the script, the data is decrypted and then encrypted with public(C)  
 -* The script uses some kind of API to find the current address of the colored coin, and if it changes, it waits to receive a private key. There also needs to be some kind of checksum with the data to ensure the correct private key is sent to the script.

You could use armory and print out encrypted paper wallets. After printing you write an extra code by hand on the printouts. Then you don't need to destroy the printer.
Armory also lets you make n of m wallets (in this case you would use 2 of 2).
Also with armory you could use the Mac mini as an offline storage machine (run and sign your offline wallets on it).
Better than destroying printer and mac !

So they can just undo the bug and it will be fixed again. So what is the problem ?
@_date: 2014-04-18 01:02:02
Wouldn't that defeat the whole purpose of escrow ? The seller could just refuse to release the coins after receiving payment.

I think you can put a public comment in a transaction, yes. Not sure which wallets support this, I have seen the option in Armory but never used it.
@_date: 2014-05-17 00:18:31
Can't do that with multisig.

Country of the node which first relayed the transaction I think.

It looks like a pool address which then pays out to the individual miners.

@_date: 2014-03-18 11:33:02
I'm sorry but that sounds like bull to me. You received a transfer of funds into your account, and your branch can't even tell you which bank / account number originated the transaction ? Pretty sure they have to keep these kind of records and you are entitled to know it. Data protection would only apply if they were giving out personal details of the account owner.
@_date: 2014-11-20 13:34:05
Why would you dump to drop the price when you could very well lose the auction anyway ?

Because...you cannot print more.
@_date: 2014-12-16 12:10:47
Can you explain this a bit more ? I thought a node would forward any valid transaction ? How can a valid transaction be "nonstandard" ?
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:46:10
That has 0 to do with regulating exchanges.

@_date: 2014-03-20 19:07:41
Some people were buying coins for around $100 in the final days. Which would imply a pro-rata cost of $400 per BTC. Not too bad for those people.
@_date: 2014-03-04 07:00:26
Could you please detail the steps required to spend coins in the wallet using the two user private keys, in the case that trustedcoin is inaccesible for whatever reason.
@_date: 2014-03-14 04:29:38
What they mean is, in order for mining to be as profitable from transaction fees as from mining coins, each transaction would need a fee of $35.
True, but it doesn't mean that each transaction costs $35.
@_date: 2014-12-13 15:42:45
420 bits @_date: 2014-12-11 12:44:59
But people have to buy BTC before they can spend it, so it all cancels out.
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:13:33
Proof ?
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:19:07
Down to $300....that would be impressive.
@_date: 2014-04-03 01:55:48
Yeah and when the price goes up again, they'll complain even more that they "never had a chance to buy in".
@_date: 2014-12-09 08:12:56
They have all been compensated, so I would say it was little more than a temporary inconvenience.
@_date: 2014-06-25 05:02:15

Can somebody explain how the difficulty changes work ? If you add a zero at the beginning of the difficulty, then that would appear to double the difficulty value. So how are finer changes made ?
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:06:19
Too many zeroes after the decimal point.
@_date: 2014-11-16 01:49:03
It surely does, for several reasons:  
a) higher price would mean early adopters would have more funds to build out and promote the network and infrastructure  
b) a less volatile price would make BTC more suitable for use as a currency. However the price is currently too low to make it stable.  
c) a falling value makes BTC unsuitable as a store of value
@_date: 2014-11-26 03:08:33
Nope. If that was the case, he would have just said "here are the addresses with the unaccessible coins" and we would all see that they were never moved.
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:54:54
Yes you are correct - but I made another mistake: private key size is 256 bits (not 128 bits). So multiply your calculations by 2^128.
@_date: 2014-07-29 02:02:47
What do you think of my sggestion that clicking on H1, H2, etc. should show what they prove ? I think it would make the proofs a lot easier to follow.
Here are some more attempts of mine:
1) Prove (A → ¬ A) → ¬ A
assume H1: A -&gt; ~A.  
prove ~A.  
assume H2: A.  
apply H1 H2.  
Qed.  
Result: Failure: Proof of imp_neg_neg is incomplete
2) Prove ∀x y : A, x = y → y = x
assume H1: x = y.  
prove y = x.  
rewrite the current goal using H1 (left to right) at position 2.  
prove y = y. exact (eql y).  
Qed.  
This gives an error: Failure: Unknown term x -- it might be a proof in the position where a term is expected.
So, I tried adding this at the start, as I have seen in some other proofs: "let x y be given.". But then I get another error: Failure: let tactic used with be when claim is not a universal quantifier.
Edit: I changed "let x y be given." to just "let x y." 
(Hmmm...there seem to be various levels of proofs, for example in one level (examples) you would say "let x y be given." and in another level (answers) you would say ""let x y.". Also in the example level, the statements start with a capital letter, but in the answer level, they must start with a lower case letter ! I FIND THIS EXTREMELY CONFUSING !).
Anyway now I am getting a different error: Syntax Error: Syntax error: expected rewrite &lt;pftrm&gt; at &lt;posints&gt;. WHAT NOW !?

@_date: 2014-12-21 22:28:41
Yes, because thinking is not the same as knowing. At best you can suspect that the price will go down, but you might still buy some to hedge your bets.  
Example: when dogecoin first came out, I was 90% sure the price wouldn't go anywhere, but I bought 200K coins anyway just in case the 10% chance came out.

You could possibly use the message field of the transaction to hold *something* which would in one operation, decrypt the data with the old private key and re-encrypt it with the new public key. Then you wouldn't need a service, at decryption time you apply all of the transformations in sequence and then decrypt with the private key of the current address.
There are a couple of snags with this, I don't know enough about encryption to know if the *something* mentioned above can actually exist. And also you would need to use specialised wallet software which would insert this "something" in the message field.
In this case you need to do the decrpyt/encrypt in one operation, otherwise an attacker can simply do the decrypt part and read the data in plaintext.

The biggest problem is this. It has split the community.
Half the community will monitor transactions and report everything dilligently.
The other half will ignore the IRS and report nothing.
Each half will try to convince the other half that their way is correct.
I believe this was a deliberate strategy by the IRS, and needs to be resolved ASAP.
@_date: 2014-08-18 21:13:20
It wasnt all one person dumping, I was watching the chart in real time. The price was jumping up and down like crazy, most probably it was due to a series of stop losses being triggered. But yeah, somebody dumped a lot to get the ball rolling.

Not sure about coinbase, but I once overpaid bitpay by accident. The merchant sent me a "refund code" which I then emailed to bitpay support, along with an address where I wanted the refund sent to. Bitpay then sent back the extra funds to the address I specified in the email.

I still don't get why the converse doesnt work:
Prove: A ∧ A → A
assume H: A /\ A.  
prove A. exact (andEL H).  
Qed.  
To me this makes perfect sense. We assume A /\ A, and we want to prove A. So we apply andEL to H and eliminate the left term, which leaves us with A. Qed.
But, instead I get the error: Failure: Unknown term H -- it might be a proof in the position where a term is expected.
How can H be an unknown term, I defined it as A /\ A, and now I want to apply andEL to it which will return A.

In the short term, yes.

One minor point, I would use the term "malware" instead of "virus". A virus is a specific kind of malware which tries to spread itself from computer to computer as much as possible. In this case the malware would be more targetted at bitcoin users and would likely be downloaded from a site or sent via email.

1) AS commented above, it may just mean banks are prohibited from dealing *directly* with BTC (i.e. operating as exchanges themselves). This is the situation in China (which was misunderstood by many).
2) Pretty much all CBs have said the same thing - you are not protected from losses investing in BTC. That doesn't mean that for example criminal law no longer applies - theft is still theft.
The statement seems completely in line with what we have read from other CBs.

Bitcoin block reward halves much more slowly, which gives the coin time to increase a lot in value between halvings. As you point out, the same cannot be said for other coins (e.g. Dogecoin which has a halving time of just 100 days). It will be interesting to see which (if any) fall victim to 51% attacks.

You can do, but be aware that some exchanges have a delay before sending coins, so the transaction might not go through as quick.
Edit: actually that might be wrong - btcpay produces payment requests, I am not sure if they also provide a simple deposit address that funds can be sent to directly.

It is certainly true for altcoins, but I don't believe the reward halving will have a great effect for Bitcoin. I actually watched the hashrate in realtime when the block reward fell from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. Hashrate dropped within a day or two by around 10% and then recovered fairly quickly to where it was before and continued to rise.
OTOH a 51% attack on a popular alt coin like Dogecoin is quite possible, due the much more rapid block halving time.

Your figures are pretty meaningless....you cant simply divide the cost of btc produced per day by the number of transactions, and claim that as the "cost per transaction".
If what you say is true, why not count the cost of internet access for all the nodes connected to the network as well ? Without paying that there would be no BTC transactions. I am sure you could come up with a figure of around 1 million USD per transaction. Heck why not count the food and rent bills for all the miners and BTC users too.

As far as I understand it, there are two types of wallet, those which use deterministic addresses (like armory) and those which don't (like bitcoin-qt). If the wallet uses deterministic addresses then that means the same change addresses will be generated each time after reloading a backup. For non-deterministic wallets, the set of addresses will be different each time. Bitcoin-qt gets around this by pre-generating a stock of 100 (by default) addresses.

The problem is this: let's say a change is made which enforces pools having a smaller share, or no pools at all. Then let's suppose it works, but after a few months, a workaround is found, and pools start to form again. What do we do then ? Change the protocol again ? Keep changing it every time the next workaround is found ?

I would leave that to the experts, I was just responding to what I read here. But maybe something like:  
- I select my vote by entering the number.  
- Scan my fingerprint to confirm and sign the transactions (votes) along with a random nonce generated by the voting machine
- The voting machine signs the transaction using the same nonce and broadcasts it

Ah I see ! So I presume in the memo field you sign something with a private key to prove it is a greenaddress.it transaction ? Nice !
Sorry for asking so many questions, but this is a really big part of greenaddress.it appeal, and there is not even any mention of it on the site ! (Actualy I see now it is buried down in the FAQ...)
The more I learn about the site, the more I am liking it !
Furthermore, I would strongly suggest, if you want to attract more novice users (which is where future growth will come from), you definitely should produce a short (2 or 3 minutes) video explaining all the features (at a minimum multisig, ntimelock, and transaction memo field at least).

Should be easily possible for the next 20 years or so until transaction fees take over.

The same address can be used for receiving as many times as you want. The exchange will know that any coins received at that address belong to you. How the exchange handles it internally is up to them. They may sweep your coins into a joint hot or cold wallet, or they may leave them in that address. Also when you spend from that address it is quite possible that the change will also go back to that address. It is just convention to send change to a new address. Again it's up to the exchange how they organise things.

OK, I see now from the USMS website:  
On January 27, 2014, the United States District Court for the District of New York entered a Stipulation and Order for Interlocutory Sale of Bitcoins. In this order, both the United States and Ross William Ulbricht agreed that “the United States, in its sole discretion, may sell any portion or all of these bitcoins, on a date or dates and in a manner to be determined by the Government.”   
So it seems like Ross agreed to this sale some time ago.

1) You should change addresses when you have used one (not wallets).
2) Offline wallets are much safer because it is impossible for a hacker to steal coins from them.
3) If you have a lot of btc, you should keep only enough for your day-to-day needs in a hot wallet. The rest should be stored offline, or at least in a paper wallet.
Edit to say:
with a hot wallet, somebody could use a keylogger to steal your password, or a hacker could steal your wallet.dat and try to guess the password.

To a certain extent. But then some of the miners that turn off their machines and were mining to hold, will buy on exchanges instead of mining. This will cause the BTC price to go up.

Here is my interpretation. The first hexagram represents the present. In this case I got hexagram 64, which is the last hexagram in the sequence. The meaning is interpreted as being "the end of the cycle", the point just before things break down and the cycle begins again.
The image here is comprised of the top 3 lines (fire) over the bottom 3 lines (water). Fire and water are opposites so this is an unstable situation.
The third line from the bottom then changes - meaning "attack brings misfortune." I feel this could refer to all the recent FUD and the Gox situation. " It furthers one to cross the great water." Great water in this case could be metaphorical - meaning a need to break with the past.
Changing the third from bottom line of hexagram 64 produces hexagram 50, the Caldron. This represents the future state. The caldron, rather than fire over water, is fire over wood - a much more stable condition, and the water is now contained inside the caldron. The caldron is the source of nourishment and creativity. 
"The Caldron. Supreme good fortune.
  Success."
Bullish !

Because of the way marketcap is calculated:  
Number of coins X Price for one coin.  
So if I create 1 billion coins and then sell just one for a dollar, suddenly my alt coin has a market cap of 1 billion.  
This is pretty much what happens with Ripple.

I can see a few problems with this - like for instance, who would ever do legit pool mining after this, when they could always steal the block for themselves ? Then it would end up with all the pools collapsing. Alternately, if most miners continued to share their blocks, then somebody like GHash could pay agents to steal blocks from other pools, thus making those pools look unlucky in comparison.

I think we need to distinguish between the micro (individual/wealth) level, and macro (national/money supply) level.
That such a transaction has an affect on the micro level I am not arguing. I am arguing that it has no net effect on the macro level.
Now whether bitcoin transactions should be restricted or not all depends on the goal of the capital controls - whether it is done for economic reasons or for political reasons.
And thanks for the reading list offer. I have studied money and finance academically and also follow a lot of financial/economic discussions online.

That is not the point. You found them from the map. They told you they no longer accept BTC. You should remove them from the map since they do not belong there any more, regardless of the reasons. 
Even better, you should tell them that you found them from coinmap, and you will be removing them from there. They may suddenly decide to start accepting BTC again.

@_date: 2014-02-28 22:36:06
Yes it does make a difference.
Let's say a year from now the price of 1 BTC will be $5000.
If you spend $1000 and the price of a coin is $1000, you get 1 coin. Thus in a year you will have made a profit of $4000.
If you spend $1000 and the price of a coin is $500, you will get 2 coins. Thus in a year you will have made a profit of $9000.
But, it doesn't help much, because without a crystal ball you cannot know whether the price will go up or down*.

Update: it seems to be working OK now. I can now type in my city name and it comes up OK, so I am happy with that.
There is still a problem with the crosshairs - it is telling me I have location services disabled on my device, when in fact I have them enabled (and other apps are able to use it). But it is not really more than a minor inconvenience now the city name is recognised.
@_date: 2014-05-14 12:24:33
AFAIK they do match up buyers and sellers, but people have to register as sellers first, and (possibly) the price is set by the site.

IMO more worrying are things like secure boot which will only allow whitelisted operating systems to be run on a piece of hardware, and those operating systems will only allow running of programs from an approved appstore.
Apple already does this for example. Edit: (to some extent);
@_date: 2014-03-10 16:25:43
Contact your bank immediately and see if they can reverse the transaction. I have read about others in a similar situation having success but I believe there is a time limit of one month or so. You may have to make a fraud claim.

I would assume they have been quietly accumulating coins for a while now.
@_date: 2014-08-11 20:24:18
1) See my calculations in other response. We would only need a price of 20K usd per BTC within 20 years for this to hold true for the next 5 doublings.
2) Assuming that the bitcoin network becomes extremely valuable (we all hope that else we wouldnt be here, right ?) then most likely some users will pay large fees to ensure that the network remains secure. (Talking at least 20 years out here, due to effect of 1) ).
 
@_date: 2014-11-26 11:58:52
i would hazard a guess at 20 - 25 %.
@_date: 2014-09-09 14:03:47
Well, that's a bit better, but I would still apply the same principle - sell in smaller chunks as the price is likely to go up several fold over the long term.
@_date: 2014-04-11 23:13:14
No, as I understand it, sidechains can use whatever mining algo they want.
Edit: actually you might not even want to mine in a side chain, since it would cause inflation in that coin.
@_date: 2014-11-18 20:14:58
There will be 64K coins left after this. It seems extremely unlikely to me that they would sell for as low as $350, but you never know.
@_date: 2014-08-11 19:09:01
You are neglecting 2 things:
a) The price of coins increases with time, so that every halving the price at least doubles.
b) When the block reward is very small, income will be made from transaction fees instead.

Bitcoin was designed to use a different address for each transaction. You should think of an address as something like an invoice number.  
It's not like we will ever run out of addresses.
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:32:59
I don't see why they need a shipping address if you are paying with bitcoin.

Trezor can be encrypted with a passphrase. So it comes down to: which is more secure, a passphrase or a PIN code ?
@_date: 2014-05-05 16:33:31
No, I didn't claim that. But long term it will almost certainly be worth a lot more than $25 IMO.
@_date: 2014-04-03 11:19:35
I think the question is, if I broadcast it today, and it is not valid for say 5 years, will it be dropped from the network.
I would say probably yes, otherwise somebody could spam the network with millions of nLockTime transactions. Most likely you have to broadcast it after it becomes valid.

Well consider for the first address, the probability of a collision is:
    10^12 / 2^160
The probability for each of the next 99 addresses is roughly similar, so the final answer is:
    10^14 / 2^160
    =
    2^46.5 / 2^160
    ~=
   1 / 2^113

Well, you could look at, for example, the amount of energy (KWH) required to mine 1 bitcoin. So for example, as ASICS become more popular, the amount of energy might drop, but as difficulty increases, the amount of energy required will rise.
Actually, a better measure might be the inverse: 1 / (amount of energy). Then as the amount of energy to mine goes down the "value" of a bitcoin in this system goes up.
I doubt it would tell you anything about the *price* of a bitcoin, but it might be interesting nonetheless.

I am not an expert by any means, but:
If you click on "network propogation", it looks like it was relayed to a server in France, which then didnt relay the transaction any further (e.g. maybe it went offline just at the curcial moment). I've never seen that before but I guess it can happen.
I would try resending the transaction and probably the second time it will go through.

Then they wouldn't be mining to hold as I mentioned above. Alternately they might have a contract to sell coins at a fixed price. If the market price drops below the fixed price then it makes sense to buy coins at market and re-sell them.

apply eq_sym A.  
prove x * (x- *x) = (x-)-.  
claim L1: G(x * (x- * x)).  
rewrite (invl x Hx).  
rewrite (idr x Hx).  
exact Hx.  
rewrite &lt;- (inv_uniq (x * (x- * x)) (x-) L1 Ginv(x)).  
prove (x * (x- *x)) * x- = e.  
rewrite (invl x Hx) at 2.  
prove (x * e) * x- = e.  
rewrite (idr x Hx).  
prove x * x- = e.  
exact (invr x Hx).  
Qed.  
I feel like this should be correct, but the rewrite inv_uniq line still gives an error: Failure: Proof term proves (forall _:?0, ((_5 _0) -&gt; (_5 (_2 _0)))) but expected to prove (_4 (_1 _0)).

Looks interesting, will have to play around with it.
I have questions - suppose I create a color, like "my house" and fund it with 1 BTC. Then I sell my house and send the coin to the buyer. The buyer then sends 0.5 BTC to each of two people.
Is that the reason for using multi-sig ? So that you can keep track of the coins and ensure they are not split up or spent like normal money ?
Also in this case, what happens if the site goes away ? Would I lose access to all my BTC in colored coins ? Could you avoid this using ntimelock like greenaddress.it do ?

Sorry if I wasn't clear. My intention was not to spread FUD.
What you say is correct. However according to the Chinese .gov it is not legal to use BTC to pay for goods or services there. That is what I meant by "banned as a currency".
It is not banned as a commodity there.

Thank you for the explanation. Would it be too much to ask for a "Formatting help" button under the text box, like you see here on Reddit ? Clicking on this could show what is allowed in the text area. Eg.
* let [variable variable...].  
example: let x y.  
* ** comment *  
example: ** this is a comment *  
Edit: going back and reading your original comments, I found this page  which is extremely helpful.
Also, what is the difference between "rewrite" and "rewrite &lt;-" (guessing that one replaces LHS with RHS and the other is vice-versa ?).   
Edit: Ah OK, got it ! They were the opposite way round to what I thought !
So with that, here is my lovely (?) proof of ∀x y : A, x = y → y = x:
let x y.  
assume H1: x = y.  
prove y = x.  
rewrite &lt;- H1 at 1.  
prove x = x. exact (eqI x).  
Qed.  
Now i know there are shorter ways of writing these proofs using lambdas and so on, I need to figure that out still.

In the first cases, nothing happens to the purchasing power of yuan. There is a buyer and a seller, just like with any other item, the net result in yuan terms is 0.
In the last case, it does because some yuan leaves the country (it is exchanged with dollars).
Replacing "dollars" with "bitcoins" in my last sentence makes no sense, because the exchanges themselves don't buy bitcoin.

First, if he was going to do that, surely he would sell his million or so BTC first before the value crashed when he made his announcement ?  
 
Second it's hard to imagine that there would be a coin so much better than bitcoin that it would immediately replace it. Even if a much better coin came along then there would be two systems in competition for a while before one or other would eventually take over.

So, presumably you will now be lobbying those miners to raise their soft limits. Right ? That would be a useful outcome of this experiment.
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:38:00
A self adjusting limit may well be worse. A nefarious actor with unlimited fiat might be able to game it so the block size is always increasing.


There are several possibilities: there may be no nefarious actors, or there may be, but they are waiting for the block size limit to be increased first, so that their actions have a much greater effect.

Transaction fees are currently about 0.1 BTC per block (source:  ). So even after the next halving that will still be under 1% compared to the coinbase reward. It will take another 3 or 4 halvings for fees to become a significant part of the block reward.

SecondMarket was, in fact, approached by Mt. Gox some time last weekend.  Mark Karpeles approached Barry Silbert to solicit an acquisition offer, and it seems likely that Silbert, who had already committed privately to building a US-based exchange bitcoin exchange, jumped at the opportunity to explore the deal.
However, when the magnitude of the theft and potential fraud became free, Silbert and his team quickly pulled out of discussions, sent an email to all employees over the weekend banning them from buying or selling bitcoin indefinitely, and most likely reported the suspicious activity to the authorities.  As a regulated entity that probably signed a non-disclosure agreement before learning the full extent of the Mt. Gox damage, SecondMarket would have had no other choice, but to keep this out of the public eye, even if it was acting honestly behind the scenes.

Exactly. Producing new coins is a service to the community. Miners are paid for that, and for securing the network as a whole.

Maybe i didn't make my thoughhts clear. What I was imagining as likely is, the Eucadorian gov. would introduce a coin, but it would only be for internal (in country use) and only exchangeable for USD on gov. exchanges (probably at a fixed rate). For external trade, they would continue using the USD as they do currently.
Any other way they do it, the coin's value would quickly drop to 0.

Not sure if you are reading these comments but I am finding it extremely difficult to follow the example proofs. What makes it particularly hard is that there is no way to know what the assumptions (H1, H2....) represent. I think what would make it somewhat easier would be if you could click on the terms like H1, and it would show you what the assumption meant.
For example, the proof of: (A → A → B) → (A → B), is given as   (λH1 H2 ⇒ H1 H2 H2). The obvious guess is that H1 is (A-&gt;A-&gt;B) and H2 is (A-&gt;B). But this gives an error, as does (A-&gt;B), A, and everything else I have tried.

prove (x-) - = x.  
rewrite &lt;- (idr x Hx) at 2.  
prove (x-)- = x * e.

*rewrite &lt;- (invr (x * x- * x) Hx) at 1.*   
*prove (x-) * (x * x- *x) = e.*  
prove x- * x * x- * x = e.  
prove (x- * x) * (x- * x) = e.  
rewrite &lt;- (invr x Hx).  
prove e * e = e.  
exact (idl e Ge).  
Qed.  
It goes fine up to the line marked in bold.Then I get the cryptic message: Failure: Proposition given with prove tactic does not match the current claim. ((( ?0) (_1 (_1 _0))) ((_3 _0) ((_3 (_1 _0)) _0))) ((( ?0) (_1 (_1 _0))) ((_3 ((_3 _0) (_1 _0))) _0))
Not very helpful. Any idea what the problem is? It looks fine to me, rewrite e with x- * x.
Also, I am not sure about the lines in italic. What I want to say is, "to prove (x-)- = (...) I will show (x-) * (...) = e" but I am not sure how to write this.

Yes agreed, it's a smart move by Huobi:  
- people deposit bitcoin with them ~~which they get to sell some of straight away (fractional reserve)~~   
- when the stock market crashes, as it eventually must, the investors forfeit their BTC ~~anyway, and Huobi gets to sell the rest~~

I am not arguing with those points. I am saying that either:

BTC is illegal to use as currency in China. Therefore the only use for it there is as speculation or a store of wealth. Since the price has been falling for a year, it is currently not very good as a store of wealth. This leaves only speculation/gambling.  
So it should be no surprise that the exchanges which offer more speculation (OKcoin with futures and leverage for example) would be more popular there.

@_date: 2014-08-11 22:14:27
It is nothing to do with being nice. It is all to do with entities paying to ensure that there is sufficient hashing power available to ensure a 51% attack does not happen.
There are various possible outcomes as the block reward falls. One is that some groups perceive the network as sufficiently valuable that they will pay miners as a group to keep the hashrate up. Another is that minimal fees alone will be sufficient, the hashrate will fall drastically, yet somehow the BTC network will miraculously remain secure. A third is that fees are insufficient  and a 51% attack takes place and bitcoin fails.
You seem to be arguing that one of the latter 2 results is likely, whereas i am arguing for the first.

There are various reasons which have been well explained elsewhere. One of the simplest to understand is that a higher price per coin means that price fluctuations are relatively smaller. For example a change of +- 1 USD is 50% if 1 BTC costs 2 USD. If 1 BTC costs 1000 USD then the same dollar amount is only 0.1 % change. 
There are other more complex factors involving for example the transaction volume and the overall distribution of coins which you can easily google for.

Correct. The inflation rate of BTC is currently around 10%. So at current prices (lets say $500 per coin) this would imply a drop of $50 over the next year.
If you think the added value due to new users entering the market, new uses for BTC etc. will push the price up by &gt; $50 in the next 12 months you should buy. If you think it will be &lt; $50 you should sell.

Possibly, in which case it would be most likely a group of miners trying to drive the price down and bankrupt the competition. Or else people who buy off miners and then dump a percentage of the coins on the major exchanges to keep the price down so they can accumulate at a low price point.

Sorry I think you misunderstood my question.
What I mean is - say I create an address on greenaddress.it, and then I use that address to pay for something online; how does the merchant or whoever know that the adress I sent from is a greenaddress.it address and therefore they dont need to wait for confirmations ?
I presume there is some kind of API on the site which you can use to query if an address belongs to greenaddress.it, is that correct ?

@_date: 2015-05-29 15:34:28
I agree with OP. The plan sounds great, but personally I would be much happier with a smaller initial increase (to say 4 or 8MB). That way a) there is still some pressure on people to innovate off-blockchain solutions like the lightning networks and sidechains. b) it buys a couple more years for ordinary home users to be able to synch the blockchain. Relying on Moore's law is shaky at best.
@_date: 2015-05-28 01:10:42
But fees only become competitive once blocks are full. There is no incentive for miners to drop transactions otherwise. A half full 20MB block won't automatically generate 20 times the revenue of a half full 1MB block. A full 20MB block might generate 20 times the revenue of a full 1MB block, but the aim is to avoid full blocks. So the argument of economics limiting traffic is a bit absurd.
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:30:45
Things like this are exactly why increasing the block limit is futile. There was even a thread in the laste few days about a company that lets you send faxes on the blockchain. A better solution is to do as much as possible off blockchain, and increase transaction fees as necessary.

Below market ? That doesn't make sense. 27 bids - each one could well have been for more than one block, even for the whole lot 50K coins.  
It seems unlikely that anyone would bid below market price. If you consider slippage on exchanges then such a quantity of coins should attract a premium.  Another thing to factor is the price action we saw today on exhanges. The price was dumped down to 370 USD. This was presumably to push down other bids. So we can assume that one of the winning bids was &gt; 370. Otherwise the price would have been pushed down further.

@_date: 2015-05-08 03:30:02
Not at all. I am merely trying to point out that we should look for other solutions than constantly increasing the block size. I think Gavin's plan of 20M with a doubling every 2 years is too aggressive. It assumes that Moore's Law continues to hold, which is a dubious assumption. For example look at CPU speeds. The last machine I built myself was in 2003; CPU speed max was around 3GHz. Assuming 1 doubling every 1.5 years, I should now be able to buy a 192GHz CPU.  Show me where I can buy such a thing.
@_date: 2015-05-08 08:55:47

But BTC cannot be used to pay for goods and services in China, therefore it is not a currency in China. All that has happened is yuan has moved from the bank of one person to another. Transferring a BTC from China to another country has zero effect on the Chinese economy.
Note that if BTC were a currency in China, then it would cause the yuan to depreciate, but only when a coin was mined in China or imported (since there would now be more "stuff" chasing the same amount of goods and services). And in fact in this case, sending a BTC out of China would in actually cause the yuan to appreciate slightly for the opposite reason.

That's the average cost. If there are groups transfering millions or billions of dollars a day it will be in their interest to pay a much higher fee to ensure the network remains secure.
Presumably there will also be a lot more than 4200 transactions per block. A tenfold increase of transactions would imply an average fee of 65 cents (inflation adjusted), and so on.

Well good Alan. I hope you also make some changes to Armory so that it is not necessary to always download full blocks, only the headers.  There are two updates to Armory that could help:  
- when adding a new watch-only wallet, it should be possible to inform Armory that the wallet has a balance of zero. This would remove the necessity to download and scan blocks up to the present time.  
- for existing watch-only wallets, add the (advanced) ability to mark them as frozen: implying that the currently displayed balance is correct and there are no movements in or out to the current time. Thus blocks up to the current time do not need to be downloaded and such wallets do not need to be scanned.

Of course, I realise that. I am playing Devils Advocate and assuming a "worst case" scenario.












Yes that's right. At the moment I am down to one machine and I need to do other things with it most of the time. According to my calculations if I ran a full node 24/7 I could handle 120MB size blocks before things got impossible, but that would be with a dedicated machine syncing in real time.






Well I am kind of convinced, but I just worry that in a couple of years we will be back here and people will be worrying about a 20MB block size not being enough and why we should increase it to 200MB.
I'd prefer a smaller initial increase (say 4MB or 8MB) followed by plans to double it every 2 years or so, provided technology keeps pace and if it is needed.

You see, I am not sure that supply and demand works as expected with currency (considering bitcoin as a currency for now). Rather than saying it inflates/deflates the currency, you could say it simply affects the exchange rate for that currency pair.
This is exactly what we saw in November, increased Chinese buying of btc affected the exchange rate of btc/yuan, pushing the price of btc up (and through arbitration also in all other currencies).
On the other hand, buying dollars with yuan affects the yuan/dollar rate, pushing yuan down and dollars up in value.
So what is the difference ? I guess the size of the "market cap" if you like. Buying btc with yuan would have a proportionally greater effect on the btc price than the yuan price because of the disproportionate sizes of the markets. Whereas yuan/dollar, both markets are roughly of similar size so the rise/fall ratio is about 1:1.
Interestingly this suggests that as the btc market cap increases it will have more of an effect on national currencies.
Added to this you have the fact that btc is also an investment, meaning as I mentioned that yuan may be borrowed to invest in btc, also pushing up demand for yuan.


in the case of exchanging yuan for dollars, presumably the yuan which leaves the country will later be sold back for dollars (at a lower rate).
in the case of a bitcoin leaving the country, what does this mean ? Does a bitcoin have to be sold back into china to keep the stock the same ? Maybe a miner could mine a coin ? I'd have to think about this some more.

So whenever fees go up, the market will be interested in decreasing those fees ? Then the free market is operating as it should. And if one can avoid those fees altogether by operating off block chain (lightning networks), or via sidechains, then the market will offer those solutions too. I don't see what the problem is.

Run the calculations on the maximum blockchain size and you will see what the problem is. A jump to 20MB blocks requires up to 1TB for a year's worth of blocks. By 2025 the blockchain could easily grow to 75TB. By 2035, the blockchain will be growing at a rate of up to 841 TB per year.
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:42:43
Well it currently takes 2 or 3 days to sync the blockchain with 1MB blocks. With 20 times bigger blocks it would take up to 2 months to sync.
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:20:05
Agreed. Only one fork is ideal. But a smaller initial increase (and then still with +40% pa built in) would be better. I don't see where the figure of 20MB comes from. Gavin's proposal was originally 16MB + 40% pa
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:49:10
Well, as you say, of course the system can be equally well gamed by small blocks. If you use mean average, then a malicious miner with 10% of the hash rate can increase or decrease the block size by 5 - 10 % of the maximum. With median average they have to have 51% hashpower to influence anything, under which circumstances I am guessing the default soft max block size setting would be the least of our worries.

Sure, I am not arguing against any of the points you are making. I would just like to see some analysis and justification for the figures that Gavin is proposing: 20MB initial block size, followed by a 40% increase per year. What will be the blockchain size and bandwidth requirement in 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years ? As we know there is one chance to get this right, and too big blocks will be just as damaging as too small blocks, but for different reasons.

I don't daytrade, but when I occasionally buy on dips I look at a variety of factors like current news events and the price on the major western exchanges (bitstamp, bitfinex, btce). I don't pay too much attention to the Chinese exchanges. I think they are probably more important if you are interested in short term movements though.  
My point was really that there are a lot more exchanges than the big name ones. If you want to get an overall picture you need to aggregate demand over all of the smaller exchanges too and try to keep an eye on the long term movements here too.

There are several things they could have done.
For example, as Andreas has suggested, taxing capital gains only when btc are sold directly for fiat, not when used as currency to buy things (you would pay sales tax anyway).
Or allowing a limit of say $500/$100/$50 whatever per transaction.
Even if you have no objections to paying tax on every single transaction, you must admit that the record keeping required may be onerous.

There is more *currency*. This is neutral for people who's income rises with inflation rate, but bad for savers and those on fixed incomes.  
Also, loan interest rates are generally set to variable during times of high inflation, or else a high inflation rate is built into the fixed loan rate.  




No, that is devaluation of the currency, not inflation.

I am not talking about just spammers. Imagine a network attack where some entity that cares only about destroying bitcoin pays non-trivial fees to ensure each block is filled to the max.

It would be foolish to ignore such a possibility.

That's fine if you are running those apps. And I suppose you have to leave them running for a while so that the txs can build up, before you could send a payment. So basically running a full node.  
What about ligtweight clients like Electrum or multibit ? I suppose they would have to pull the value from an SPV server. That's one more thing to trust - a malicious server could tell you the fee is 1BTC per transaction.

Wrong. Larger blocks don't lead to increased adoption.

Need arises - I wouldn't put an exact measure on this, but for example if blocks are on average &lt; 50% full then there would be no need to increase the block size, whereas if they were on average &gt; 90% full then probably the size should be increased again.
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:53:01
Oh you can bet on it.
@_date: 2016-03-03 08:10:41
I think you are being a bit disingenious - transmission of the witness data can be vastly reduced using weak blocks and IBLTs. Furthermore there is a real saving in storage size since nodes can choose to prune the witness data or omit it altogether when synching up to the current checkpoint. When you account for these factors then it becomes clear that it is actually part of an overall scaling strategy, with the added bonus of eliminating malleability.

The simplest way to answer:
he doesn't need a computer, since there is a network of other computers around the world which will hold his money for him. Similar to the way he doesn't need a safe in his house to hold his fiat money, there are banks that will do that for him. Except that with bitcoin, the network is the bank.

Seems unlikely, I was running it on a fairly new laptop, which has not shown any other problems. On reindexing it found an error around block 180,000, and everything after that started showing up as orphans. I am guessing it was a harddrive failure somewhere, but still it seems a little odd.

@_date: 2015-01-14 00:49:34
a) By the time you know it was the bottom, the price will probably be higher than when you sold.  
b) The one sure thing I know is...the very day I sell a large part of my coins....that very day will be the exact time the price shoots up and I have to buy those coins back more expensive later.
@_date: 2015-01-10 12:31:13
Did you overlook my use of the word "average" ? It makes not much difference anyway, even an hour between blocks still wouldn't add up to "tens of thousands".
@_date: 2017-02-09 10:38:42
Nothing to do with blockstream. Core published a scaling roadmap some time ago which includes first implementing segwit, then later dynamic block size increases. The blockstream devs are also on record as being opposed to hardfork blocksize increases prior to working for Blockstream.  
You'll have to try harder I'm afraid.

I had a problem last week where all new blocks were being rejected as orphans, Reindexing did not fix it, I had to download the entire blockchain again. I wonder if it is related. I am using the binary bitcoind (not self compiled).  
Or just another "coincidence" ?
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:52:07
Well obviously part of the mixing process is to use the same fee for all transactions. Input size (and age of coins) only determine the minimum fee.

I would say a combination of a) people not knowing you could get away with not paying a fee, b) because the wallet writers made it so, c) for the same reason people tip in restaurants, and d) concern that there might be a sudden spike in transactions which could cause delays for free transactions.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:03:54

You assume they are hyping it because they bought a lot of coin. That is one possibility. A more likely one is that they bought a lot of coin because they studied it and thought it had potential.
@_date: 2015-05-25 13:58:42
No because, blocks are already over 0.5MB from "normal" transactions. But my point still stands, if some malicious entity wants to DDOS bitcoin, then costing 20 times as much won't be much of hindrance (assuming they have access to unlimited funding).
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:18:59
Yes that may be true, but you claimed they were shutting accounts whose coins had been "tainted" by SR at some point in the past. I never heard such a claim, and that would be whole different level of scary.

@_date: 2015-01-26 05:33:20
Yes I did read the article. Did you read my first response ? Did you understand it ?
Perhaps I could have phrased it better, let me try again:
"I read the article. Basically they are saying if you (later) mix anonymised inputs with non-anonymised inputs, then the anonymised inputs can be linked to the non-anonymised ones. That seems pretty obvious. Presumably after passing coins through a mixer you would send them to a separate wallet, to ensure that this kind of thing never happened."  
To be clear, passing the coins through the mixer anonymises them fine. Only later if you *personally* mix (i.e. not through a coin joiner, but via a send of inputs from your own wallet) your anonymised coins with non-anonymised coins, then it becomes obvious that the anonymised coins are related to the non-anonymised ones.  
Is that clear now, or would you like me to try and explain it again ?
 
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:20:21

@_date: 2015-01-10 10:42:43
Yes, so what ? It is making lots of transactions. But there is about 30 seconds between each transaction. So that would be 20 transactions per block average. Still not "tens of thousands".
@_date: 2016-03-08 15:52:06
Thats not bad. Aparently the next version of Armory was supposed to have a feature like that, but it never got released. I understand you can use pruned blocks but you lose the history.
Anyway that seems to suggest you still need to download the entire blockchain, even if you later discard some of it. So sharding would presumably not help there.

I see you are planning on adding a secure time delay to multisig at some point. IMO that would be a really useful feature. For me it would actually make the difference between paying for an account and using the free service. I'd urge you to prioritize that if at all possible.
@_date: 2016-01-28 17:30:31
That seems like a rule that is impossible to enforce. I would say that the security hole is actually that too large a percentage of users rely on SPV rather than running their own nodes. Increasing the block size is bound to make this security issue worse.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:47:05

@_date: 2015-01-14 14:40:11
Some of those unprofitable miners who stop mining will start buying coins instead. This will increase demand and help push the price up.
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:54:48
So you agree with their determination then ?
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:20:42
Well, what you could do is join a pool. Then fast forward through time until a block is generated. Once you find a block, travel back in time to a few seconds after the previous block was generated. Then transmit the block. Then repeat. In this way you can artificially increase the hashrate for a couple of weeks; thus your pool will mine a proportionally larger number of blocks and you will get a larger share of coins. Doing this you could probably get 10 to 20 times your normal amount of coins. But it sounds like a lot of work.  
@_date: 2015-01-22 10:20:39
I'm prepared to be prepared.

I really don't get why we need to go to 20MB blocks straight away. I would much prefer a system where we go to say 4MB blocks next year, then if the need arises, 8MB blocks the following year, and 16MB the year after that.   
Doing it that way keeps up the pressure to innovate and come up with alternate solutions which avoid using the blockchain. Going straight to 20MB blocks means people can continue being lazy for 2 or 3 years until we find ourselves in the exact same position again, but with much larger block sizes.

No, it changes nothing. Coloring is just a label you put on a certain amount of coins (an input). Let's say you have 0.1 btc, and you decide to link that 0.1 btc to ownership of a particular car. You sell you car and transfer the 0.1 btc to the new owner. The new owner agrees that the 0.1 btc represents ownership of the car. When the new owner sells the car, the person they sell it to also agrees to label the 0.1 btc as proof of ownership of the car, and so on.  
If you use a special wallet which labels that particular input as car ownership, then you can track who owns it. You could do that anyway by tracking the coins through the blockchain, it's just convenience, the wallet adds a label, and stops you spending those bitcoins as if they were money.

OK, let's game play the effect of allowing unlimited block sizes.
Another miner (b) decides to undercut them and allow any transaction fee &gt; $0.20. In the short term he makes more money. Then (c) comes along and decides to mine all transactions regardless of fee. In the short term he makes more money. The users then realize that there is no longer a need to pay fees and stop paying them. Miners are now back to relying on block subsidies and so most of them go out of business, especially as the block reward decreases of time.
The alternate, as you say, is for all miners to agree on a minimum transaction fee. Whilst it temporarily prevents the above scenario, it is a point of unstable equilibrium and therefore it will eventually degenerate beginning with one miner defying the cartel, and cascading from there.

If you mean the blockchain, then yes obviously. If you add in micro transactions then there will always be more demand than can be reasonably fit into a block.
If you are talking about the current situation then I am eagerly awaiting segwit, and I hope the current "panic" will persuade wallet developers to implement it ASAP. After that we will see what the core devs propose for the hardfork.

Yes you are correct, I don't dispute anything you say there. I was attempting to illustrate that the bandwidth issue has been addressed adequately for now; however, what segwit adds is a reduction in storage costs, since the witness data can be pruned without losing transaction history (which also affects synching new nodes). So in this respect it IS a scaling factor.

The BTC market is distorted because of the block reward which subsidises it. Just like in Europe, primary healthcare is "free" (mostly) but subsidized by the taxpayer. If a private healthcare provider wants to compete they have to offer a better service (shorter waiting times, more personalized care etc). But miners can' t offer a better service, either your transaction is included in the next block or it isn't.

@_date: 2016-01-18 17:23:24
It would be relatively easy to change the limit. Gradually replace Bitcoin Core with a new client (lets call it Bitcoin New) by bringing up a few dozen nodes per day. You could even work up the crowds to support your new version by convincing them that the core devs are evil. Then when you have a majority of nodes running bitcoin new, switch off bitcoin halving. You could probably convince the hordes that halving is evil as it benefits only long term holders, and reducing the reward limit is bad as fees would need to rise to replace the lost reward. Then just tell the heads of the 5 largest mining pools that halving is cancelled. They will love it and run the new software. Job done.

Sure. Anybody can find the private key here:

20 times as long to sync the blockchain, and 20 times as much diskspace required. I already need to dedicate 1 night per month just to synching the blockchain, I wouldn't want to have to do it every night. Plus the diskspace requirements - I would basically have to buy a new hard drive per year.  
Plus there is always the risk of moving home to somewhere with only a slow network connection, in which case I might never be able to synch the blockchain !
I would be in favour of a smaller increase, say to 4MB now, doubling every 2 years.

It's in the definition of a Soft fork that older clients still function. That's why the Core devs choose to do segwit as a soft fork.
@_date: 2016-01-06 11:06:14
I get what you are saying but firstly you could equate it to buying some coin, transaction with a fee, then the miners selling those coins. Whilst the buying part could raise the value, the equivalent sell lowers the value again. Secondly, groups which are only interested in the blockchain are likely the ones most keen to have low transaction fees, and by extension pushing for as large blocksize as possible. The costs are borne by node operators, but since they are not in the business of running nodes this does not concern them;

Well, logically LN cannot increase centralisation more than running the plain blockchain, since there is still the option to transact directly on it.
On the other hand, it would be interesting to see some estimates from the BU team relating to what percentage of nodes would be forced off the network depending on the average block size. Surely such data must exist, right ?

Lightning doesn't use side chains, it uses an alternate routing which would only need to go throught GFC if you were paying somebody in China from outside China or vice versa. The point is to separate transactions from blocks. You can actually get near instant payments using lightning.

People need to stop treating Satoshi like a god. Yes he (or they) were very smart and designed a great system. The blocksize limit was added during development, as Satoshi realised that damage could be caused by malevolent miners creating too large blocks. That situation has not changed.
Satoshi was simply giving an example - "if it becomes a huge problem, it can be resolved, FOR EXAMPLE: a one time. well planned hard fork could increase it".
He certainly never suggested that the miners should be free to decide the block size for themselves. You don't solve a potential spam problem by allowing people to create spam at will. Neither did he suggest a continuously growing max size as some have claimed.
Technological progress has continued since Satoshi made his quote. At the time there was no idea of things like segwit, or second level networks which could run on top of Bitcoin.

As I understand it, nodes are also supposed to be a balance to miners, otherwise miners could just put whatever invalid transactions they like into blocks. Also nodes act as filters, removing invalid transactions before they get sent to the miners. So they are a vital part of the bitcoin infrastructure.

It gives value to the blockchain, sure. But that doesn't necessarily translate into giving value to bitcoin - in fact it could be the opposite. Imagine for instance that a company decides to pay miners directly in fiat to include their fee-less transactions, and cut out all that messy bitcoin. I am amazed that so many people fail to see this.

Segwit allows historic signature data to be pruned from storage. So it allows for larger blocks without increasing the storage space requirements. So in this sense it is a scaling solution.

How would you set a minimum fee ? There will always be a miner willing to include more transactions to earn more fees.


In that case, the outcome is the same for the spammer (they get priced out), but there are larger blocks permanently in the blockchain. Yes it may inconvenience people less, but the downside is a bigger blockchain. Inconvenience is temporary; blockchain size is permanent.

Yes, for sure the devs would be able to get on more with improving Bitcoin, which we all want, rather than having to deal with annoyances.
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:27:03
Technically OP is correct. But those IOUs can be redeemed on the blockchain at any time, and they are secured by locked up bitcoins.

@_date: 2016-06-19 22:24:07
Nope, seriously, there were people posting there who were claiming it was impossible for bitcoin to go over $500 because the number of transactions was proportional to price and there wasn't enough room in the blockchain.
Edit: here we go, one example: 
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:00:28
And if no one uses it at all, it will be 0 meg. So what is your point ?
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:06:25
Yes, there are several versions of this FUD:  
- "core" thinks they can control Bitcoin  
- "core" are making economic decisions when they should be simply providers of technology  
- "core" is controlled by shady companies (Blockstream, AXA,...)  
- only 4 or 5 people control the commit keys for Bitcoin, if they dont like your patch it wont get in  
- "core" are in favour of censorship and they work with Theymos to censor free discussion  
- core devs are deliberately preventing Bitcoin from scaling, they could just increase the block size but they refuse to do so  
- etc... etc

I am running a full node, but BCH is on another blockchain.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:30:26
It is still possible if they don't include any segWit transactions in the block.

Social consensus first - this is then embodied in the code which people run, which enforces it on a practical level.
@_date: 2017-01-28 19:40:23
Segwit IS a block size increase.

Then you should definately be against Segwit 2X which allows up to 8MB blocks.

Not being able to show the source of funds and not providing ID are two different things. Why are you pretending they are the same ? There could be a host of reasons why somebody cannot prove where they got funds from, even legitimate for legitimate funds. If such a proof is needed then either it should be asked for before allowing deposit, or else the customer should be allowed to withdraw their funds and their account closed. Allowing deposit and then not allowing them to withdraw because some piece of documentation is missing is theft, pure and simple. KYC means that you need certain documents to do business with clients, it's not a carte blanche for robbery.

The bitcoin software reference client (which some people refer to as "Core") has regular releases. This software has never supported UASF or any other non-consensus soft or hard fork. The only news here is that in the next release, some code will be added to ignore nodes running the potential segWit2x hard fork. Their blockchain would be invalid anyway, so this just reduces network noise.
@_date: 2017-08-06 07:59:32
That's the demand side of the equation.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:26:30
And there will be less and less interest at each fork. Just like with alts, the first ones did somewhat OK, but now everybody pretty much ignores them.
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:40:34
No, they are real Bitcoins. How do you figure otherwise ?
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:21:18
Oh goodie, a Block party !
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:31:25
They want to divide the community further with the segWit 1x, segWit 2x fork perhaps.
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:05:33
Switch your mining to a pool that supports the original blockchain. Slush for example are not signalling for 2x.

The two things are not exclusive.

LOL I was thinking of a similar analogy a couple of days ago, but more along the lines of:
- hey our cars need to go faster. Our engineers are working on more powerful motors which burn fuel more efficiently and achieve a higher torque rate.
- never mind that, lets just add more cylinders to the engine. We did a test with a 32 cylinder motor and it was really fast. Our next design adds a further 160 cylinders to the engine. We have done the calculations and our chassis should easily be able to support up to 800 cylinder engines.

You would have to persuade a majority of the 6000 or so full nodes too, otherwise they would reject the blocks from the miners.

Ah I see. Well they CAN continue using covert ASICBoost, or the non-covert version provided they exclude all segWit transactions. The difference is that it is now much more visible. Before they could use the covert version and it wouldn't be noticed.

@_date: 2017-08-06 00:31:57
Not sure. Lets suppose that speculative traders are buying BCH and selling their BTC, and hodlers are selling their BCH and buying / hodling more BTC. Thus the traders' BTC is removed from the market and put into storage. Less BTC on the market -&gt; price of BTC goes up. Seems plausible to me.

More likely the problem is that the Bitcoin exchange rate is still too low. If you are selling the property for 120k, that would be about 30 coins at current rates. Considering that few people are likely to part with all their holdings, you would be looking at somebody with a couple of hundred coins at least. Statistically there would be fewer than 10,000 individuals in the world with that many coins.
Even with 10k people, probably only a few dozen of those would be interested in buying a property in the US midwest. Of those few dozen, likely none of them saw your ad.
As the BTC price rises, more people will fit in your target market and the chances of a succesful sale will therefore rise accordingly.

It's not correct to state that segwit / LN will cause miners to get less fees, in fact they will probably get more !  
pre segwit: 10K tx per hour, fee = $.1 (total $1,000 per hour)  
post segwit: 10M tx per hour (off chain), off chain fee $.001 (total $10,000 per hour)  
10K tx per hour (on chain), on chain fee $10, total $100,000 per hour

Well, let's see - we started a move up from $600 about a month after I made the prediction. Two months in and we are now up about 25%.   
Another move of 25% would take us up to $940, which could easily FOMO us up over the ATH. So I think my prediction was correct. What do you say ?

Not really, the ice cream maker can produce more ice cream if the demand goes up. If miners (or others) set the block size to some limit then in effect they are setting the tax level on transactions.

Blockchain had some security issues which affected a handful of users very briefly one time (maybe twice).

@_date: 2016-11-28 23:53:14


Yes and with BU that longest chain can be defined solely by the miners, because the majority of nodes will eventually accept it. With Core it cannot exceed 1MB per block. I don't understand why you are having such a hard problem seeing that.
@_date: 2016-12-01 21:00:06
You need to parse it a bit to fix the grammar - for example I got "4 reason why Bitcoin is flawed". But anyway funny stuff.
@_date: 2016-11-27 22:38:53
So what ? Merging is just an administrative task. You still didn't answer my question about developer numbers.

It's only been out for a couple of weeks.
@_date: 2016-11-21 15:47:25
You see, this is why I can't take them seriously. If 30 or 40 core devs left and decided to work on a fork of core because they had problems with it then that would be one thing. But BU seems to be just 3 or so guys and some excitable followers.

Ah I see what you mean. So let's say some group (R3 for example - who employed Mike Hearn, or Roger Ver, or Blockstream) wanted to influence the direction of the software, looking at the number of developers gives an indication of how many individuals they would need to bribe and/or threaten in order to get their changes included in that software, which is really what we mean when we talk about centralization of development, right ?  Obviously nobody is forced to run their software.
So now if you would be so kind as to answer my question we can resolve this debate.

Well....duh...that's the point.
@_date: 2016-11-20 23:42:13
What about the money they have already made ? Currently the miners are making $730 * 1800 per day = 1.3 million. Before the halving they were making similar amounts. That's several hundred million this year alone. Why wouldnt they have invested most of this money in building up their operations ? So why would they need to get this back when it has already been earned and invested ?
@_date: 2016-11-23 00:36:13

@_date: 2016-11-21 12:28:16
You are making it sound like the devs picked a value and are forcing everybody to abide by it regardless of their wishes. In fact the devs must follow the wishes of the communiy else nobody would be using their product; so I suggest that the vast majority are happy with the 1MB limit. We would like to see SegWit enabled too, so if you could stop blocking that it would be great.


Nope, if they create a too large block in core then the nodes will reject their blocks. On the other hand the block size setting in BU can be overridden by miners and nodes eventually have to accept any size of block (look it up).

Me too. It was gentlemen.

Bitcoin has [died 118]( times already.
@_date: 2017-01-27 14:53:10
I dont. But that is not an answer to the question I posed.
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:53:16
If you run a node - upgrade to 0.13.1 or higher. If you are a miner, mine in a pool that supports SegWit such as Slush. As well as that, correct any misinformation you see about SegWit.
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:30:37
Then its even more undervalued.
@_date: 2016-11-02 12:26:36


What a great way to run a multi billion dollar financial system - yeah let's listen to speeches by "prominent individuals" to decide the technical parameters of our system.

I've paid for several games on Steam with Bitcoin and always had a good experience with them.
@_date: 2016-11-20 23:31:27
You would also fork off 30% of nodes (probably 50%+ by the time segwit rolls out), creating an alt coin.

Are Coinbase opposed to SegWit ?

Do you have a link for that ? It sounds really bizarre.

Did you forget to post a link ?
@_date: 2016-12-07 13:26:34
Somebody in another post mentioned

Simple, for every tether printed, there is one dollar held in a deposit account somewhere.
@_date: 2016-11-18 15:27:16
  
@_date: 2016-11-20 23:25:05
It's not decentralized, the miners can override any setting.
@_date: 2016-12-06 23:20:15
Are you deliberately trying to obfuscate ? "To avoid a hardfork allowing the (centralized) miners to control the maximum blocksize"
@_date: 2016-11-27 23:23:08
Well yeah sure, but lets say (pure guessing) 10000 LN tx per on-chain tx. LN fees can be .01 cent, on-chain fees could be $10. So for this channel:  
user fees 0.01 cent + 0.1 cent = 0.11 cent per tx  
LN node fees = 0.01 cent * 10000 = 1 dollar  
miner fees = $10.
Looks like a win-win-win situation to me.
@_date: 2016-11-22 09:27:30
R1 ?
@_date: 2016-11-23 01:39:47
bitFury are signalling segwit in their coinbase but not yet in versionbits. Could very well be next.
@_date: 2016-11-27 22:19:42
I think it's a misconception that LN will reduce miners fees. There will still be huge pressure to get transactions on-chain, probably even more than today. It's just that most of the "losers" can settle off chain instead. It will be incredibly valuable having a perment ultra-secure transaction record, and people will still pay for that. Just that you won't need that when buying your cup of coffee.
@_date: 2016-12-14 01:38:19
Well, there's a surprise.
@_date: 2016-11-26 10:03:38
As somebody who travels quite a bit, none of you here are really giving good answers.  
First of all, Bitcoin was designed to be supra-national, the idea that having a "foreign" passport should bar one from an exchange does not make sense.  
I see some recommending LBC, Mycellium trader, etc. While this is fine for small amounts, what if OP wants to sell thousands of dollars worth per month ?  
Situations like this will only become more common in the future as the price of BTC rises and holders become increasingly rich, work less, and travel more.  
Now for the good answer - please, somebody who is in the US, do some actual research and find which exchanges there accept non-US passports. In theory they all should, I mean why not ? But this will be good to know, I am sure this question is going to come up more in the future.
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:16:15
Stop calling it 2 meg, please ! With segwit, the 2X fork will have up to 8MB blocks (total).
@_date: 2016-11-20 23:22:05
Segwit what ? Reaching 20% miners and 30% nodes ? That's what made the price go up.
@_date: 2016-11-21 15:40:57
But they can't do that. They would have to revert (at least) all of the segwit stuff in every change. How are they going to test it without a test net of their own ?
@_date: 2016-11-25 01:30:21
So clearly, the number of transactions in the mempool will keep on increasing forever, right ? Oh whoops, it's down to about 20K now. Never mind.
@_date: 2016-11-20 15:53:28


So in your world 7 / 93 == most ?   


  
You see, if you accuse others of being trolls and spreading lies, it helps if you spread the truth yourself.
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:51:22
The governments won't but some of the people there might.
@_date: 2016-12-19 16:20:26
They could require an out of band log in /password before allowing you to do lookups or broadcasting txs.
@_date: 2016-11-18 17:05:20
Seems unlikely, since 30% of nodes have already upgraded, and the release has only been out for a couple of weeks. By the earliest time segwit could activate, probably 50% or more of nodes will have upgraded so miners performing this attack would be on a minority chain. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 23:42:54
I said you should check further. You can start here 
@_date: 2016-11-02 12:04:18
You can still validate transactions without keeping HISTORICAL witnesss data.
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:43:55
That's why we need SegWit and LN
@_date: 2016-11-21 20:41:46
OP said "being", not "been", there is a difference. Plus over 30% of nodes have upgraded already.
@_date: 2016-11-22 23:17:03
Sure, but it should be a choice that both sender and receiver agree to.
@_date: 2016-11-01 00:01:14
No worries...it gave me a good laugh though ;D
@_date: 2017-01-08 07:20:24
IMO they used to be good until a couple of years ago when they got bought up by a media company. Before that they published only economics articles with a refreshing contrarian / investigative angle. After they got bought up they started focussing more on politics and recently the articles have been getting more and more sloppy. Also the quality of the comments has gone downhill in sync with the quality of the articles. Im not sure if they are trying to monetize the site more but some of their articles feel like they are trying to push an agenda. The Bitcoin article would be an example of this.
@_date: 2016-11-26 16:58:12
Memorable developers indeed then.
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:14:24
Block size is no longer used since segwit, they can set the maximum block weight now instead.
@_date: 2016-11-28 23:18:20




No, SegWit allows for blocks up to 4MB in size.
@_date: 2016-12-17 02:24:30
Maybe not scammed, but the data is less than 100% correct.
@_date: 2016-12-19 21:48:59
Not really. I am using an external (USB) hardrive though, so that may be a contributory factor.
@_date: 2016-11-03 18:39:54
Oh that's true yes.
@_date: 2016-11-26 10:49:15
Yeah it is really stupid. Kraken should be OK, though, you can trade up to $10K per month with email ID, right ?
@_date: 2016-11-03 00:30:23
Fair enough.
@_date: 2016-11-27 22:15:54
Ridiculous ! They will likely make more in fees, since opening and closing of channels will be done on-chain. As will any transaction which needs to settle on chain. As will any transaction that wants a permanent record on-chain.
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:49:18
Then you should support SegWit as it will allow up to 4MB blocks straight away.
@_date: 2019-08-24 17:43:13
What about Armory ?

@_date: 2016-11-28 13:08:39


I doubt it - in the unlikely event that a hostile fork were to become the dominant one, I would guess most current developers would quit in disgust. That's certainly what I would do in their position.
@_date: 2016-11-19 21:30:08
Then you should like Core's roadmap: 
"Finally--at some point the capacity increases from the above may not
be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them."
@_date: 2016-11-17 13:52:47

Don't have a link, sorry, but I saw a post in the other sub a couple of days ago where the poster referred to segWit as being "confirming transactions for banks" and Andreas of being a stooge for the central bankers.

We know that ING holds at least some of it, I would guess the other banks and their clients prefer to remain anonymous. My guess would be some banks in Hong Kong since Bitfinex are based there, and Hong Kong banks were recently shut out of the international banking system.

What about Xapo ?
@_date: 2016-11-16 15:41:20
No, the wallet generates your private keys, and those keys never leave the wallet. When you want to make a transaction, the transaction is sent to the wallet, the wallet signs it and sends the signed version back to the computer / phone.
The wallet only reveals the public keys (addresses) so that the computer / phone can look up balances and transaction history.
@_date: 2016-11-28 23:30:37
Miners can override the limits set by clients. You should check further into how BU actually works.
@_date: 2016-11-02 20:45:03
You wouldn't need to, all the addresses are already in the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-12-02 22:07:42
But they arent supporting SegWit.
@_date: 2016-12-12 11:55:15
In the sense that you mention, yes.
@_date: 2016-12-17 16:29:30
If they switched to BU, nothing would happen since most (&gt;90%) nodes would reject blocks &gt; 1MB. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:33:51
Hardware wallets are safer, as are air-gapped computers.
@_date: 2016-12-01 01:57:17
Shouldnt matter....wallet formats are backwards compatible.
@_date: 2016-12-08 19:00:18
Eventually they will reach the sweet spot of that particular Laffer curve; then the miners will realise that the only way to further increase income is by expanding the tx rate, with the more expensive transactions staying on chain and the rest being farmed out.
@_date: 2016-12-23 00:59:42
No, it's not useless. Once the supplier becomes comfortable with Bitcoin, they may choose to keep part or all of their receipts in BTC. In addition, if they find accepting BTC to be convenient, they may persuade their suppliers to also accept Bitcoin. Once that happens then they can eliminate the fiat step altogether.  
Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither was the cryptocurrency economy.
@_date: 2016-12-19 15:43:36
Fees will drop drastically when we have LN working well.
@_date: 2016-12-06 23:09:19
Unless blocks are full the marginal cost for a miner to add an additional tx is minimal, therefore filling a block to 95% or so would be very cheap in terms of fees, but increasingly expensive for nodes in terms of resources as the blocksize limit increases.
@_date: 2016-12-08 19:10:54
Do you think miners should run as a charity ?
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:02:14
Tether actually serves a useful purpose. You can deposit 1 usd in a bank and get 1 tether. You can then send this coin to an exchange and use it to purchase BTC, even on exchanges which don't have bank accounts. In this way it increases the demand for bitcoin, which would otherwise be limited to exchanges that offer usd deposit accounts directly.
@_date: 2016-11-16 15:47:52
UK also: 
@_date: 2016-11-22 15:03:50
Use a wallet that shows you. It's not rocket science.
@_date: 2016-11-26 16:48:09
Why ? Seriously.
@_date: 2016-12-19 19:37:58
Sure...I am not saying my prediction WILL happen, just that it is a possiblity....if more and more people run SPV clients then it is possible that "free" SPV servers will get overloaded and enterprising individuals / groups will set up non-free SPV servers (obviously optimised for performance). The best defence against this is to make sure that it is as easy as possible to run your own node.
@_date: 2016-12-23 00:55:19
..has **gone** up..
@_date: 2016-11-22 23:12:41
They don't reveal the offers until the day itself.
@_date: 2016-11-25 01:27:19
Brought to its knees ? Did any nodes crash ? It seems to me like the mempool worked flawlessly.
@_date: 2016-11-25 01:34:46
Millions ? I would be surprised if they have 100K customers worldwide.
@_date: 2016-11-22 00:40:33
Sure, why not ?
@_date: 2016-11-28 01:27:12
In addition it would fork off all segwit supporting nodes onto their own blockchain (currently 1/3 of all nodes, but still climbing).
@_date: 2016-12-17 16:55:47


Anybody who wants BU is likely already running a BU node. So no, I doubt anybody else would "upgrade".
@_date: 2016-11-27 22:25:06
Oh yes ! Please, rename it to LEGACY_BLOCK_SIZE_LIMIT. I want to see exploding heads !

Would you trust a coin that was mined by the central banks ?
@_date: 2016-11-27 15:42:36
At least he is cleaning up the UTXO set.
@_date: 2016-12-08 22:35:20
Well that remains to be seen. There will be a lot more transactions, and obviously miners will pick the most lucrative ones to include in blocks. It's likely there will still be a large premium to be included on-chain. With more users and transactions there will be more competition for this, so it is quite possible that fees will actually go up as a result.
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:38:00


That's another great argument for off-chain scaling.
@_date: 2015-08-06 23:27:04


Exactly what permission did coloured coins need ?

@_date: 2015-08-02 19:30:01
No I think you misunderstand the point I was trying to make. Even if the transaction fee was something like 10 dollars, I would likely still use the blockchain directly myself a few times a year to move funds to and from my savings accounts. But who knows. If the fee were thousands of dollars then yes likely only banks would be using it for settlement. I think it would be wise to look at different possible future scenarios and then decide the block size behaviour from there, rather than the other way round.
@_date: 2015-08-18 23:26:48
How will slush know ? I thought they were a pool.
@_date: 2019-02-19 23:09:55

Your version is more accurate. which is why I said "half joking". I claim dramatic license.
@_date: 2019-02-20 06:42:34
And how would you stop the miners from keeping half the coins for themselves and becoming super rich ?
@_date: 2015-08-05 22:14:00
Unfortunately Armory wont run with pruned nodes, and it seems they have no intention of ever changing that.
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:56:35
Nice. Is there somewhere I can read about client configurations for this ? I'm quite happy with Armory, but I am worried about disk space if we move to larger blocks.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:44:39
8MB blocks without doubling is not an option being offered currently. So there is little point in discussing it. Better to talk about real possibilities like BIP101.  
1) Do you understand what Capacity Planning means ?
2) Obviously you will want a backup, in case the original gets corrupted. Or are you going to spend literally weeks downloading the several TB of blockchain all over again ?
3) Agreed but you quoted a figure of $130 for buying ten years of diskspace NOW. I was just trying to show that that was an underestimate.
@_date: 2015-08-22 17:03:57
So where can I buy my 100GHz CPU ?

Krugman, is that you ?
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:28:06
No he doesn't. Only the miners get a vote.
@_date: 2015-08-11 03:55:17
Perhaps, but then what would be the value proposition of using bitcoin as opposed to one of those other networks ?
@_date: 2019-02-20 19:04:36
Doesn't matter. They could censor transactions, demand proof of ownership of addresses, blacklist coins, double spend with impunity, and there is nothing you as a coin holder could do to stop it.  
In addition you need competition between miners else there is no financial incentive to increase the hash rate and thus increase the cost to attack the network.
@_date: 2015-08-17 11:11:13
I think we need both - LN and a safe block size increase. But blocks should not increase as fast as the XT proponents believe.
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:35:32
The default soft limit in XT is equal to the hard limit. So no changes required.
@_date: 2015-08-17 23:53:04
I don't know. What outcome do you expect from your BIP ?
@_date: 2015-08-10 06:57:59
Yes, I suppose you might.
@_date: 2015-08-10 06:09:26
Can you explain this a bit more ? What are these script elements ? How did they become "lost" ? Why would they (not) be reintroduced ? How would they allow a 2-way peg ?
@_date: 2015-08-18 13:40:54
Yes. I think you could add to that list Markov Chain Modelling, ISTR that word order frequency is a good differentiator of styles.
@_date: 2015-08-15 21:06:52
Of course there will be. With 8MB of block space, everybody and their mother will be spamming the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-02-19 23:07:05
Yes, stablecoins are better than fiat because they keep their value against....err.....fiat.

That is a one-off change, and it explains what he meant by "phased in". Curious how people here are trying to interprite "phased in" to mean a continually increasing limit. Almost as if they had some agenda to push.

I think the answer is, if you used 256 combinations per character instead of 58, you would end up with a shorter string, but you would also have to deal with unprintable characters (character 0 for example).
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:20:21
Most of the devs realise there is no need to rush to raise the block limit, and would like to give a chance for other solutions to be implemented. They also see Gavin's fork (8MB + doubling every two years) as too large of an increase.

I think your list is not quite correct. Gemini have said they will apply as a Trust rather than go for a bitlicense. itBit already have Trust status and so they are exempt from Bitlicense.  
You should update your data to show this, otherwise it looks like more companies are applying than is actual fact.

@_date: 2015-08-14 16:04:03
Obviously I can't be sure, but I imagine in the future when a person signs up with a larger exchange (e.g. coinbase) they will either be offered the chance to register with a payment hub (which will have a wallet on the same exchange), or else the exchange itself will offer payment hub services.  
So as soon as they buy some bitcoin they will have the chance to transfer some / all of their balance off chain to a payment processor.  
That should cover a majority of these situations I would think.

That's debatable. Many people think that doubling the block size NOW, right after segwit has already increased it, and in a rushed untested way, without full community support isn't a good change.  It could also be that they are holding back the unpopular changes for later once they have more control. Imagine if they proposed for the next change "alright, we will totally eliminate fees, but in return we want unlimited block size and no more halvings". Probably a lot of the community would be in favour (oh goodie, no more fees !) and the rest would be opposed (no more halvings, that means more than 21 million coins !). But still they could push that through and still afford to lose another chunk of the community.

"Same" implies no differences. I think the word you are looking for is "similar".
@_date: 2015-08-17 11:17:07


I don't believe that is the case. On the one hand, if you have no block size limit then fees tend to zero as there is no incentive to leave any transactions out of a block. On the other extreme, with a very tiny block size, everybody is competing to get their transaction in the block, and so the tx fee would be huge. Somewhere in the middle is a sweet spot where blocks are full and fee revenue is maximized.
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:04:47
I would refer to such people as [agorists]( rather than anarchists, but its a very good point.
@_date: 2015-08-22 12:31:08
Is there any evidence that the occasional full block is causing loss of revenue (revenue to whom, the miners ?). Besides, I believe that the same thing would happen with any limit. Simply that the number of transactions would scale up, because the bitcoin blockchain would be used for more purposes than simply financial transactions.

But you arent forced to use LN. If privacy is important to you then you can still transact on the blockchain, albeit for a higher fee. I agree that we will need to increase the block limit some time and to some extent so that fees are reasonable (for some definition of reasonable), otherwise, yes, we will have failed, and then I would *then* support a big increase in block size.  
But note anyway, even Gavin admits that not all transactions will be able to fit on the blockchain, so some form of LN will be needed whatever happens.
@_date: 2015-08-21 18:57:51
Is there a HOWTO somewhere for this ?
@_date: 2015-08-15 14:34:55


- - see 
- - the cargo is variably presumed to be a range of hoped-for events: an
adoption surge, a speculative rally similar to (or bigger than) 2013,
or a global financial crisis that sees Bitcoin become the safe haven
of choice.
- - for the cargo to be delivered, a "runway" must be built - the larger
the runway, the larger the cargo delivery. If the current runway is
not expanded, then the cargo plane will go to a different island and
won't come to Bitcoin Island.  
This kind of sentiment seems very common here.
@_date: 2015-08-26 23:15:24
Seems to me that's about as it should be. The unmet demand can move off the main block chain. The block reward will be only 6.25 coins per block in 2020, so the fee market needs to start taking up the slack.

Segwit IS a compromise. It allows up to 4MB blocks (tx + witness).

@_date: 2015-08-16 22:22:47


How do you figure that ? Anyone will still be free to use bitcoin, just that the transaction fee may be higher than at present. More importantly, when they use it, they can still hold the blockchain on a normal consumer PC. No banks involved as far as I can see.  
Perhaps you mean that with large blocks, only banks will be able to afford to run full nodes.
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:36:13
Yes, I would be fine with that too. For me, the big problem is always the doubling-every-two years. It is also a bit disingenuous, I don't believe the true problems will start to appear until 10 - 20 years in.

I don't think that is very likely, however I dont think there is anything wrong with that either - if people want to create an alt coin with huge blocks they should be able to, just call it something else, not bitcoin. In this case BTC would be seen more like digital gold and the price of each coin could rise immensly. If you are a BTC holder you should be very happy with this outcome.
@_date: 2015-08-31 01:06:10
I agree, this is the best suggestion I have seen so far. I would prefer a version with Dr. Back's lower limits (so 2 - 8 now, 4 - 16 in 2 years, 8 - 32 in 4 years) letting miners vote on a value within the limits. With a check after 6 years in order to review the effects and establish further bounds.

That figure is seriously wrong. Does that include doubling every two years with interpolation, like BIP 100 ?
According to my calculations 10 years of BIP 100 would require up to 32TB disk space. Of course you need to double this (you keep backups don't you ?) so that is 64TB. The cheapest 4TB I can find where I live is around $300, so 64TB will cost around $4800. Of course disk space will come down in price over the 10 years but its way higher than the $130 you claim.
@_date: 2015-08-27 13:15:02

@_date: 2015-08-17 10:29:06
With lightning, in a worst case, some subset of transactions (off main chain) are centralized. With big blocks, worst case, ALL transactions are centralized.  
Therefore LN is preferable to big blocks, since with the former at least the main chain remains decentralized whatever happens.

The coin has done nothing to address AsicBoost - therefore one miner has a built in advantage with it. There is no scaling roadmap beyond increasing block size. There are supposedly several development "teams" working on it but I have never seen a full list of the developers, how many actual developers are there, what is their background and experience. AFAIKT, there is no innovation going on beyond copying core and borrowing a few unproven ideas from Classic, XT, unlimited, etc. Please correct me if I am wrong, but these are not signs of a good coin.
@_date: 2015-08-06 00:04:47
Armory could do it I think because they create their own database from bitcoind. Step one would involve indexing only the transactions which feed into your wallet addresses. Step two would mean adding a checkbox to the new wallet import to say that the newly added wallet had never been used.  
They pretty much rejected step two when I suggested it to them.

I think if/when mass adoption comes, people will be using Bitcoin but they won't even realise it.

The same way that most people have Android on their phones, but they don't realise they are using Linux.

So you are saying that the way to defeat a rushed, and contentious hardfork is to do an even more rushed and conentious hardfork ? And if the miners decide next year that there will be no more halvings ? Core should just blindly follow that too to avoid a chain split ?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:23:25
A hardfork for core would be a last resort, to rescue the system in case of existential threat (e.g. miners attacking the chain with a 51% attack). But yeah, they could probably bundle in replay protection along with a POW change. I doubt anybody who is a Bitcoin supporter really wants that though.

Every time anyone tried mining with one, I'd use my knowledge of all the ways they are incompatible to fork them, making it clear they can't be trusted for mining. Then I'd go a step further and "for the good of Bitcoin" create a process by which regular soft-forks and hard-forks happened so that Bitcoin can be "improved" in various ways, maybe every six months."
@_date: 2015-08-19 12:14:31
The wording sounds a bit biased. "No change" implies leaving the block size as it is and working on alternate solutions. "Do nothing" sounds like leave the block size as it is and, well, doing nothing.... Do you understand what I mean ? I think the wording "No change" is more neutral, I don't mean to sound petty, but I would strongly urge you to change it.

The incentive is to flood the resources of smaller miners and eliminate them from the game.  
Just like when a big store opens a branch next to a bunch of smaller stores: they offer discounts which will lose them money just until the other stores go bankrupt, and then those discounts disappear.

I think I see the problem here, you are obviously not a developer and you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the development process. Let me give you an imaginary case as an example. Suppose you were a developer, and you spent some time looking at the Bitcoin code, and you found some great way to speed up script checking. That would be a great thing, since each block normally has thousands of transactions, and the scripts for each need to be checked to make sure the coins can be spent. So, the first thing you would do is to discuss your idea, most likely on IRC (chat) or on the dev mailing list. Perhaps you made some fundamental error, or misunderstood something so your idea wouldn't work. But assuming you had come up with something useful, the next thing to do would be for you to implement the code. To do that you would create a branch (fork) from the main Bitcoin development repository. Then you would write your code, test it as much as you could (on testnet). Once you had it tested then you would create a pull request (a patch of the differences between your branch and the original branch). At that point other developers could apply that patch to their own code to do their own testing, and to check the code for flaws, make sure it doesn't impact other areas of the code, make sure it complies with the coding standards, etc. After that process is done and everybody is happy with your patch, you would submit your pull request to the queue of patches to be added to the next release. Once your pull request reaches the front of the queue, at that point one of the commiters (and this is their only job), would press the Merge button, and your code would be merged with the main branch. I'm simplifying things a bit, but as you can see from this example, the role of the commiter is just administrative, as I mentioned from the start. They don't have any special powers to change code, approve or deny things beyond what any of the other developers have.  


Yes, I am well aware of what you have argued, yet you have singularly failed to show even a scrap of evidence to back up your arguments.


Have you considered that perhaps they just lost interest and moved on to other things ? And if they don't have the time to code, then likely they don't have time to merge pull requests in the main branch, so it makes sense to give the commiter role to more active developers ? Gavin resigned as chief scientist some time ago to take up a position at MIT I believe. Jeff left to set up his chain analytics business, and apparently didnt even have time to fully support segwit2x as he left to work on an alt coin.  


Well, here we are in 2017 and we have block sizes up to 4MB in size (counting the transaction and witness data), so we are pretty much on track with his wishes. And note that The quote is from 2015, before the Scaling 2016 conferences where the consensus of devs decided on rolling out segwit before doing any block size increases.   
Peter Wiule's quote was from 2013, well before segwit and other scaling technologies were a thing. Also there is no mention of a timescale, it's possible he was thinking of 10 years down the development roadmap. But yes in this case I would be interested to know if his views have changed now and why.


The existence of the queen of England doesn't imply that my grandmother is not a baboon. So my grandmother must be a baboon, right ?  


I think I understand the threat from the clear description you have given, but as I already mentioned, one of the reasons we have validating nodes is to keep a check on miners. Blocks that are lacking witness data would not be accepted as valid by the nodes, hence the attack would be useless and if other miners start mining on top of such blocks it would result in a chain split with the majority of nodes rejecting the invalid blocks. You still haven't responded. Also if the other miners were logical, they wouldn't start mining on top of the invalid block, instead they would keep on mining the first block and release it with witness data thus orphaning the badly behaving miner and any other blocks he had built on top of it would be the bad miner's wasted energy.

It's a trade off:- you need more users squeezed out to apply more pressure to be included in a block and thus raise the tx fees. The quid pro quo is that it costs an attacker more, and thus the attack is over sooner. However there is a additional benefit which is that there is less bloat on the blockchain with small blocks than there would be with larger blocks.

I've made a suggestion several times to the Armory devs that they implement a very simple update. When importing a new wallet/key in Advanced mode, there should be a check box "This wallet has never been used". Clicking the check box would simply import the wallet or the key without having to rescan the entire blockchain. Of course there should be a warning to the user that they will not be able to access coins already in the wallet.  
I don't understand why, but the Armory devs have refused to add this trivial feature improvement.

You can think if it kind of like a compression of several transactions into one. So instead of recording every coffee purchase you lock up some coins and then each time you buy coffee it comes off your locked up balance. You and the storekeeper can release the coins at any time, but probably you wont choose to as you will pay the transaction fee. It works by the fact that you can make / check a valid transaction, but choose not to transmit it.

Your paper is valid for a limited set of considerations. However it does not consider the effect of a bad actor paying a mining cartel in fiat in order to create as large blocks as possible regardless of the orphaning risk. As long as the bribe amount is greater than the the money lost via orphaned blocks, it is more profitable for the miner to accept the bribe and bloat the blockchain.

A couple of points: a) Force and Bridges were FBI not CIA. b) The funds which were seized in 2013 were fiat accounts. As far as we know, no bitcoins were ever seized from Mt.Gox.

Well that is not strictly true. You are part of the network and the network as a whole sets the rules.

You would need to update the version string as well.

Because it is a system of checks and balances. Nodes are supposed to be a check on misbehaviour by miners. Allowing nodes to choose how they act to check the miners opens things up to social engineering.  
For example, suppose nodes could configure "coin reward per block". What then ? Somebody might offer 1000 dollars to each node that sets this value to 500.  Then what happens ?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:32:18


Indeed. Hence I predict that before the next halving they will fork again, to remove the halvings in exchange for zero transaction fees. Most likely they will throw in an unlimted block size as well to handle the influx of free transactions. It makes perfect sense for a coin controlled by miners, and whose supporters like big blocks and low tx fees.

Fair enough, I was going by the language on the bitcoincore page. But I'll take your word for it.


That's not at all obvious to me, I would assume such decisions are made by consensus of all the interested parties. Also it is not surprising that the most experienced and knowledgeable members of the team take more of an interest in pull requests, since they would have a better grasp of the overall design of the software, and these are also the people who would be trusted in the commiter / maintainer role. To convince me otherwise you would need to show me an example of where a block size increase was being discussed and the other 3 commiters (assuming what you stated is true) who are not employed by Blockstream were overruled by the commiter who is employed by Blockstream. Note that none of the developers listed here are in favour of 2x  whereas if they believed that there was an urgent need to increase the blocksize they should surely be for it.


Yes I meant to link to here:   


You may be right, but I am prepared to give them the benefit of the doubt until then. Also if they were to use their patents to attack others then they would lose a tremendous amount of goodwill. I am not familiar with the exact patents they have (as a developer I have been advised never to read patent applications) but I would imagine they are related to processes; it is impossible to release a process under a general public license, it's nonsensical since you can only release implementations under a public license, and implementations are covered by copyright, not patent law. What you are seeing here are some of the many flaws with the current US patent system.  
Now, returning to your original allegation which was that Blockstream were deliberately slowing transactions on the blockchain in order to promote their sidechain business. I told you I am not an expert in sidechains but I gave you an example whcih you didn't find convincing. As luck would have it Blockstream themselves (I should point out I have no personal or professional involvement with Blockstream) released some new about their new sidechain  If you read the blog post it describes the sidechain features which are to do with scripting, Schnorr and MAST. It seems like it would be irrelevant for such a sidechain whether the main blockchain was full or not, since it seems to be for an entirely different purpose (scripting and perhaps testing out newer technologies) than Bitcoin's financial blockchain. I.e it would make no sense to push transactions off the main chain.
regarding your comments about segWit, I'll watch the video later, and think about it some more. But off my head it seems like such an attack would not work, since as soon as a "good" miner produced a witness block, all of the nodes would follow that chain since it would be the longest *valid* chain, the other chain being invalid as it would be lacking the witness blocks. So the "bad" miners would find themselves on a fork with no nodes, or only pre-segwit nodes. They could also start spending coins from segwit addresses and the same situation would occur.

Didnt stop us last time, why should it this time ?  
A couple of facts:  
before the recent "stress tests", blocks were on average only 40% full, so there is plenty of room for organic growth.  In fact the predictions were that we wouldnt need to raise the block size until July 2016 at the earliest.
  
A rising price doesnt lead to more transactions, in fact it may even lead to fewer transactions, as people hold onto their coins rather than sell them. Once the price settles at a new level, then transactions might go up again.

The danger is that this would run out of control. Consider, at any block size X, all nodes that couldn't handle blocks of size X would be forced to shut down, leaving only the nodes that can handle that size or higher. For the remaining nodes, there would be nothing wrong, and there would be no incentive to reduce X to allow more nodes back in. In fact for a company offering for example, full node services, the incentive would always be to increase the block size limit to eliminate less well financed rivals.

I suppose in a sense, yes, it shows what is technically possible. But it doesn't tell you *when* it will be standard issue or how widespread. And relying on Moore's law is dangerous - obviously, it is not a law like the Law of Gravitation, rather it is derived from past observations; actually the original Moore's Law referred to the increase in the number of transistors in a CPU ! 
In reality, things tend to be more sticky, they dont change smoothly but often in jumps. And if you are the wrong side of the jump things can difficult. Also it would be foolish to consider Moore's Law in isolation. A worldwide depression, a regional war or epidemic, even freak weather events, all these kinds of things although maybe low probability could have an effect.

What about the doubling time ? IMO two years is way too quick. Make it four years to coincide with the reward halving and I guess a lot more people would support it.
@_date: 2015-07-30 20:15:50
Doubling of max block size.
@_date: 2015-08-17 12:19:01
He supported a one off change apparently, not doubling every 2 years. So presumably he would advise against running XT.
@_date: 2015-07-09 11:11:23
You are exactly right. One look at Gavin's plan which allows block size to double every 2 years is enough to confirm that.
@_date: 2015-07-30 00:32:55
Yes, they agreed to a one time increase. But they didnt agree to doubling the blocksize every two years. Why is that so hard for people to understand ?
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:38:30
But it would force many full nodes to shut down due to bandwidth and hardrive costs. Which may be the ultimate aim of the "spammers"
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:31:32
It will get much harder (even impossible for many) if Gavin's plan goes ahead.  Besides if you are going to do that why not just run Armory ?
@_date: 2015-07-05 13:25:05


As you say, it is indeed unlikely. Long before that happened one (or possibly both) of two things will likely occur: either the block size limit will be raised, or the alternatives (lightning and sidechains) will be ready to go. I dont think there is any need to panic (nice Greek word :D).
@_date: 2015-08-26 12:00:18

@_date: 2015-08-11 09:47:08
That's why I say "should", "ought to be", but it seems to me like a year should be plenty, the changes needed in core are not very big.   
Regardless there is enough time that we don't need to panic. The sky is not falling.
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:45:52


Are you kidding ? The time of the last ATH, MtGox was the biggest exchange and it was taking literally months to get fiat withdrawals. There were no large US exchanges and Europe had only Stamp and BTC-E. The best wallet around was bitcoin-qt. Blocksize limit wasnt a problem because nobody was even discussing it, Gavin had tried 2MB blocks and had to roll them back and forget about it. And there were no stuck transactions because every time there was a transaction spike all the exchanges would crash (but then again nobody was spamming - sorry "stress testing" - the network at the time).
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:56:30


That is not true at all. Imagine if the attacker wants to send 2MB of spam. With a block size limit of 4MB, he can send his spam with minimal or no fees. With a 1MB limit he is competing against all other transactions and he will have to pay a much higher higher fee. It will cost him way more in the second scenario than in the first.
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:52:36
Was 2 cents too much for you  to pay ? Here have your next ransaction fee on me. 0.0001 bitcoin @_date: 2015-08-27 10:41:18
Didn't you get the memo ? The "higher orphan rate" theory is dead.  
@_date: 2015-08-17 05:43:06
It's a difficult question to answer. I think the ideal system would be to target transaction fees and set the block size dynamically from there, rather than the other way around. I am starting to warm to BIP100 because I think in some way it could allow the miners to achieve this.
@_date: 2015-08-18 19:54:47
Or they will just spend more money, and we will be shut down for 30 days with the downside of an 8X bigger blockchain; or perhaps fees will go up exponentially and they will run out of money more rapidly with small blocks.
Also: transactions time out after 48 hours and have to be resent. So either they keep the spam up for all those 30 days, or else the backlog is cleared after 48 hours.
So you see, its not quite as simple as you make out.
@_date: 2015-08-17 10:45:07
I addition to all this, if you really dont like it, you can still transact directly on the *decentralized* blockchain. Transaction fees may be higher but the choice is there.

@_date: 2015-07-07 09:57:22

Miners dont "download" anything.
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:38:59
No, what will happen is what should happen: fees will go up until the attacker runs out of money. Then the network will recover and no permanent harm is done.  
If there were no limit on block size, fees would not go up and the attacker could continue with his spamming creating huge blocks. These blocks would remain in the block chain forever, even after the attack stopped and thus permanent damage would have been done.
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:06:50
Doesn't that just mean they are including more spam in the block chain ? Before the so called "stress tests" started, the average block size was around 400KB, and I can't believe "real" transactions have jumped that much in a couple of weeks.  
 
Ah sorry I forgot, this is so bigger blocks must be better regardless of what is in them.
This is why I laugh when people say "oh, but setting the maximum block size doesnt mean blocks will grow to that size, miners can set a lower limit". Because this is EXACTLY what will happen every time somebody starts spamming bigger blocks or when they start to get full naturally. Nobody cares, because they are using SPV and not running full nodes. But you should all care. 
Do you guys get it YET ? Be very careful what you wish for.

@_date: 2015-07-01 11:23:56
I agree OP. In addition, it feels like the so-called "stress tests" are being  deliberately engineered in such a way as to scare people into supporting an immediate block size increase.
@_date: 2015-07-29 11:45:44
What proof is there that miners are behind this ? It seems highly unlikely as the net result may be to push people into supporting larger blocks, which currently is counter to the wishes of a large segment of miners.
 
@_date: 2015-08-17 23:41:16


Miners earn a reward of coins per block, currently any amount up to 25 coins. I think I might write a BIP to make the maximum amount configurable in bitcoin-qt. It's the democratic way to go, right ?

@_date: 2019-06-22 21:49:52
@_date: 2015-07-07 10:04:11
Yes thats a good solution. Or you could maybe set the number of transactions you are willing to hold in memory, and drop the lowest fee transactions (fixed transaction count rather than fixed fee count).
@_date: 2015-07-07 10:13:54
There are two different "costs" here and you seem to be confusing them. The first cost is the cost to miners to maintain the network, i.e. pay the electricity bill, buy and maintain the equipment, pay staff and rent etc. This cost is obviously less than 3,600 btc per day, otherwise the miners would be making no profit.   
The second cost is what the holders of bitcoin pay in order to have the miners maintain the network. This cost is currently 3,600 btc per day. This cost is not paid for by fees (which are a much smaller fraction of this), rather the cost is paid for by inflation of the other coins (each coin held is worth fractionally less because there are now more coins in existence).  
These coins can then be sold by the miners (either now or later) in order to cover the mining costs discussed earlier (since most of their suppliers will want to be paid in fiat rather than bitcoin) and to make a fiat profit (in case they prefer that to a purely bitcoin profit).
@_date: 2015-07-30 08:33:47


I don't think that is always true. In effect, tx fees are like an auction of the free space left in blocks. One could imagine a really extreme scenario where tx fees reached a million dollars for example, and all of the attacker's coins were absorbed as fees in a single block.
You also need to consider factors outside the normal model. For example an attacker could pay a miner in fiat to fill blocks with spam rather than via bitcoin tx fees. The miner would then need to decide whether to take the bribe (fiat), or allow genuine transactions in the block and collect the (in coin) tx fees.

@_date: 2015-07-07 10:29:17
But if only full nodes are doing the validation then we need as many full nodes on the network as possible. Which is best achieved by keeping block sizes smaller rather than larger.
@_date: 2015-07-30 20:23:01
I disagree - if there has been disruption it has been due to the "stress tests" deliberately filling blocks with spam in order to cause delays, and perhaps with the aim of stopping the price rising. The exact same thing could occur with larger blocks, just that it would cost the attacker a bit more to do the attack.

Miners have the power to produce blocks, full nodes have the power to validate them. As it has always been.
@_date: 2015-07-30 17:40:52
Why not ? Most blocks are only around 40% full as it is (except when "stress tests" are taking place). We should be fine for at least another year - add on a little extra to provide a small amount of inconvenience in order to spur alternate solutions and you end up with this.
@_date: 2015-07-07 10:19:56
From what I have seen on here the kneejerk reaction is to raise the block size, not to develop lightning networks/sidechains. Besides, Todd is a developer. If he wanted to develop these things he would just work on it (which he presumably is), and offer his solution, why would he need to alarm people ?
@_date: 2015-08-02 22:37:20
Fine you have nicely outlined the possible dangers of too small blocks, but on the other hand, if (main chain) blocks are too large, then only a few people / groups will bother to or be able to run full nodes, due to the bandwidth and storage space costs. So you end up in the exactly the same situation with a few thousand nodes run by those with sufficient resources to afford to do so.
@_date: 2015-08-10 11:48:45
Yes true. I was assuming a "worst case" scenario. But there is no way of knowing in advance if it will be a "rare" occurrence. Miners currently have an incentive to produce small blocks, but that could change in the future.
@_date: 2015-08-10 06:39:53


So what is stopping you from developing the code ?
@_date: 2015-07-07 23:13:50
With 100MB blocks you would likely  be down to a few dozen full nodes that could afford to maintain the network. Is that really what you want ? I certainly wouldnt feel comfortable with that.
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:25:44
Manual adjustments via consensus / hard fork are also fine I think.  Again, the problem I see is with automatic increases. If it transpires that block sizes increase in proportion to the maximum, and this in turn leads to centralisation (via fewer independent full nodes), then I imagine it would be very difficult, if not impossible to turn the block size increases off - because in that situation the few groups that still controlled bitcoin would obviously be in favour of further consolidation. Once that line is crossed it becomes impossible to return to a decentralized network.
@_date: 2015-07-10 00:07:32
Why would they be forced to use a centralized service ? Do you understand how Lightning Networks functions ? Do you understand sidechains ? Neither of those are centralised ! Wake up, you are having the wool pulled over your head !

No. But people weren't spamming the blockchain back then.

That is not true. A dev might support both No Change and one of the other solutions (AFAIK that is luke-jr's stance).  


How so ? One or more of them may have some other idea which is not listed there. 
And for example, there are some scalability workshops coming up in the next few weeks. If new solutions are proposed that one or more of the devs likes, then that could be linked from the "other" column.
How can you pre-judge whether consensus could be formed around an unlisted suggestion ?

Why would they stop then ?

It was Satoshi who invented Bitcoin, not Shkreli. You seem a bit confused friend.
@_date: 2015-07-29 18:52:46
Sure, but assuming these things will go on for the next 20 years is dangerous. Look at CPU speeds for example. During the 90s it was doubling in line with Moores law. My first CPU was 8MHz. But then some time in early 2000s, we seemed to stop around 3.5 GHz. Yes we added more cores but I still cant buy a 10GHz CPU off the shelf. Why did that happen ? Because for most consumers, CPUs are fast enough, there is no pressure to make improvements. More cores can be useful because consumers want to do several tasks at once (e.g. browse the net, edit a document), but raw CPU speed, less so.  
Network bandwidth increase may start to slow. Simply because most people dont need to do much more than watch video in real time. Why would an ordinary user need 1Gb bandwidth when they only use around 50Mb max ? Similarly, why would an average user need a 200TB disk, when 100TB is probably enough to store a lifetimes worth of data for them ?
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:32:19
If there is space left in a block, why would they leave transactions out ? If the transaction fee is anything &gt; 0 then it is more profitable for them to include it than leave it out.
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:23:31
Exactly. Guys like him only read carefully prepared "Policy Reports", which brief them exactly what to think on an issue.

@_date: 2015-08-17 14:52:30
I think at the moment LN looks most likely to handle most transactions. I think less likely some things might move to alts (e.g. lightcoin for micropayments, monero for dark markets).  
If the XT fork wins then we will get huge blocks eventually, and probably more centralisation of nodes, loss of privacy, etc. And even in this case LN still might be necessary depending on how things scale up.
@_date: 2015-07-09 01:26:14
Well in that case we can extrapolate to the limit: which is preferable - a small block with infinite fees, or an infinitely large block with zero fees ?
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:39:28
Seems like. Also the "big blocks upvote / small blocks downvote" army seems unusually active. Must be getting desperate for some reason.
@_date: 2015-07-30 00:20:30

By RBF you mean "double spending" ? Yeah I can see why it would be tempting to support that.
@_date: 2015-08-28 02:26:28
I beg to differ again. Bitcoin is actually two technologies rolled into one: a peer to peer payments system, with a proof of work blockchain on top to prevent double spends.
"An immutable public ledger which is available to anyone who wishes to submit transactions with required fees" describes the blockchain part. The same could be said for the Litecoin blockchain, the Etherium blockchain, or any other alt coin that uses proof of work.

The fundamental error in this analysis is that you are thinking in only one dimension: number of transactions per block. In fact the solution space has at least 2 dimensions, for example: tx fees vs. tx space. You need to take all relevant factors into consideration before proposing a solution.
@_date: 2015-07-10 02:02:09


Which is precisely what you could end up with with huge blocks as well. Concentration in the hands of a few mining groups and a few full nodes. Perhaps it is unavaoidable if bitcoin becomes more widely used.
However, I still think Gavin's doubling-every-two years is insane. If there has to be an automatic increase it should err on the side of too small. Something like doubling every four years in sync with the reward halving would be my best guess as to an optimum value.
@_date: 2015-07-03 11:28:55

Then they won't run XT because it is 8MB + doubling.
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:18:20
Yes thank you for that. I think we are agreed that the block size doubling is far more important than the initial increase, and deserves to be selected very carefully. It will set the course of bitcoin for at least the next two decades. Yet oddly I don't recall even a single thread discussing that aspect. I wonder why that is.
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:03:54
That's not really what I am getting at though. A free market in the traditional sense doesn't mean completely unregulated. For example if I want to trade 4 chickens for 10 apples, and you swindle me and only give me 6 apples, is that really a free market ? How about if you give me 10 stones painted green and claim that they are apples ? Would you argue "it's a free market, not an efficient market, now go away" ? I don't think that would get you very far.
@_date: 2015-07-01 11:54:55


That is only the starting size. Due to doubling / interpolation, max block size will reach 100MB in early 2023 according to Gavin's patch in XT.
@_date: 2015-07-10 12:12:24

@_date: 2015-08-27 00:43:50
Perhaps it has somehow eluded you, but there are dozens of companies all vying to sell Blockchain services - they don't care about bitcoin, they just want to get their transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. So any increase in max block size will be met with an increased number of transactions, but they won't be Bitcoin (the currency) transactions. (Imagine for example that Nasdaq do what they claim and put all trades on the blockchain.) None of this affects the bitcoin value, these will be dust transactions with minimal miners fees.  
And while this is going on, anybody who wants to run a Bitcoin (the currency) node, will be forced to deal with all these other non-financial transactions. These companies have made it clear they don´t care about Bitcoin, the blockchain is what they want. It would be better for Bitcoin if they went and used somebody else's blockchain (I hear Etherium has a nice one...)


Developing offchain services isn't progress ? I would say it is, we cannot simply keep growing the block size every time blocks get full.

With small blocks, transaction fees will rise until the attacker runs out of funds. However the difference in this case is that the damage is temporary. With large blocks the damage is permanent as the spam remains in the blockchain for ever.
@_date: 2015-07-07 11:45:08
Unless blocks are full there is no incentive to pay any fee for a transaction. A 100% full 1MB block could well produce more fees than an 80% full 20MB block.
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:38:28
I don't agree. I think this conflict was deliberately engineered. Block size was simply an obvious and visible issue to rally people behind, if it hadn't been that the bad actors would have chosen some other point to make contentious.
@_date: 2015-07-29 18:05:08
If 20MB were the limit there wouldn't be a problem. But Gavin's patch includes doubling every 2 years until we reach 8GB blocks.

@_date: 2015-08-17 15:22:06
Correct me if I am wrong - dogecoin has smaller blocks, but since their block production rate is faster, their blockchain grows a lot faster than the bitcoin blockchain. In fact this causes them to be a lot less decentralized than bitcoin, and they are forced to do merged mining with litecoin.
@_date: 2015-08-07 03:59:56
I think this is what will happen if the big blockists have their way. You may save on transaction fees, yes, but you will end up paying an annual fee to an SPV provider to do address lookups and broadcast transactions. And will you trust your SPV provider / ISP not to log IP addresses, require usernames, ID, etc. ?
@_date: 2015-08-13 14:42:13
No, Satoshi wasnt omniscient. For example he had no good solution for how mining subsidies would be replaced by transactions fees. Neither does Gavin, except to say that "some change will be needed to handle this".  Satoshi probably put in the 1MB limit assuming that it could be increased if no future technology were developed to make the change unnecessary.
@_date: 2015-07-09 11:06:42
It's a depth value so it presumably would be set to some reasonable value. Seems like a good idea as it would prevent the type of spam where a sends to b sends to c sends to d sends to e sends to....  all within the same block.

How does having more users help ? Users don't do validation, only full nodes do that. If anything, having more users makes things more difficult as there are more transactions to be processed and verified.


Why is that a problem ? Thats what lightning, side chains and alt coins are for.
@_date: 2015-07-07 20:16:08
They dont download anything. Transactions are transmitted to them, they verify them as the come in (as any full node does), and then they get added to the memory pool. When a block is found, transactions are selected from the memory pool and added to the next block. The only reason to publish a small block is that it is very slightly quicker to transmit.
@_date: 2015-07-30 20:35:58
Good. I would rather we move slow than rush through a change which could have unintended consequences down the line.

mining reward per day
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:49:37
And there is no guarantee that increasing the block size will solve this. It will simply cost an attacker more to do the same attack. Im sure for some groups, even paying a few million a day would be worth it to cripple bitcoin, it would just be another cost of doing business. Or if a central bank decides to do it, they can simply print the money they need to run an attack.
@_date: 2015-07-30 20:47:20
Removing the cap altogether would be suicidal. All an attacker has to do is bribe a miner to produce a few 10GB blocks now and again and the blockchain would become irrevocably bloated.
@_date: 2015-07-09 11:00:25
If you did software development you would know that is often correct. You fix the complex problems first, otherwise they never get tended to until it becomes a crisis. This is especially true if the simple "fix" is really just a temporary work-around.
@_date: 2015-08-22 13:05:33
I don't think that link has any relevance to curent block size. He is talking about some hypothetical future situation where the number of transactions is higher.   
And where does central planning come in ? The max block size is set and the free market decides the fee value based on demand for block space. There have to be limits on the block size, because it is a shared resource (like air, water, roadways, canals, etc). Why is it shared ? Because it has to be distributed and stored in as many places as possible. Yes, decentralization which you also support.

And I agree with them as do many other educated and experienced computer scientists and engineers. So touché.
On the other side I see just two core devs and a handful of loud voices on Reddit.
If you are an educated computer scientist / engineer type, why not publish a paper showing if / how Gavin's doubling of max block size every two years can be handled in terms of disk space and bandwidth requirements, comparing technological growth at classic Moore's law and sub-Moore´s law rates. Compile estimates of the number and geographical distrubution of full nodes, along with other estimates such as the number of SPV users, and SPV lookups. Do this for Gavin's proposal (doubling per two years) and other possibilities (e.g. doubling every four years).  
If you are as you claim you are then this would be a far more worthwhile contribution than posting opinions.

@_date: 2015-07-29 11:49:51
Of course it will have an effect, the size of the blockchain will grow. And that effect will be permanent.  
As opposed to now - tx fees will go up temporarily until the attacker runs out of money, and there will be no permanent damage.

Due to variance, a miner can try to create a huge block plus several normal sized blocks on top of that. If he can trick the network into accepting the huge block he can then transmit the normal sized blocks after that, giving himself a head start.
@_date: 2015-08-11 11:01:28

Wladimir vaan der Laan, lead developer of bitcoin QT I would guess.
@_date: 2015-08-06 02:36:09
No, what you state is absolutely incorrect. For example, I don't agree with Gavin about the rate at which block sizes should be allowed to grow. Yet I would love to see Bitcoin take over the world. I just want to ensure that when Bitcoin takes over the world it is still decentralized and not controlled by a few groups running centralized data centers. So I think we need to be way more conservative than Gavin suggests. 
 I also think we should find other solutions to increase transactions in addition to increasing the block size. In a paradoxical sense Gavin is thinking too small. If we have machines transacting then we need to support trillions of devices, and there is no way to fit all of that on the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-08-20 05:14:29




Why do you persist with this *disinformation* ? Even Gavin himself admits that what you would like is not possible:

You know nothing of what you talk about. 28Kb modems stopped being used in the early 90s. Even in 1995 I had a 56K modem. 15 years ago I had 512Kb. I currently have 35Mb so that is a 70 times increase in 15 years. Way less than the 1000 times you claim.

You are expecting 100% of miners to collude in order to exclude low fees. Never going to happen. There will always be one miner who will include all the low fee transactions and he will make more profit than the others. Its a basic Prisoner's Dilemma.

How else would you interpret "territory of freedom" ? Freedom and capital controls simply cannot co-exist.   


I was trying to make the point that  it doesn't follow from "As long as you participate in and enjoy the benefits of  X" that "X s going to have control over all capital within it. You have no personal sovereignty, and your assets are only yours in a limited sense." I chose Mafia as an extreme example, but I could equally well have said "As long as you participate in and enjoy the benefits of a Public Library, it is going to have control over all capital within it. You have no personal sovereignty, and your assets are only yours in a limited sense."

Yeah, it's kind of hard to judge, because we are not comparing apples with apples - obviously their market cap is a lot smaller than ours. But if you look here: 
 you can see that they have less than 1000 nodes and less than 1% of the hash rate of BTC (I think that must include the merged mining). So I would say that is quite centralized in comparison, it wouldn't take much to pull off a 51% attack. But then again the figures for litecoin are similar so perhaps things are not as bad as they appear.

Whilst you are partially correct, in that a catastrophic loss in decentralisation would eventually serve to lower the price, this is problematic, since once centralised, decentralising again most probably would be impossible. Thus once the price signal is received it is too late and cannot be acted upon. For this reason I believe this is an exceptional case where some pro-active outside guidance is needed to adjust the market ahead of the delayed price signal.

That's a reasonable ECONOMIC argument, but if you care about decentralisation then leaving the choice of block size to miners is a bad way to go, for reasons which have been expounded ad infinitum both here and in other fora.

Maybe in some specialist shops. The largest I can find in physical shops where I live is 4GB.  That will cost you several hundred dollars. Just for the privilege of running a node.
And by 2026, you will need something like 50TB per year additional disk storage. Remember, this is cumulative.
By 2036 you will need something like 900TB per year.
Then there are the bandwidth requirements. Remember as a full node you need to upload as well as download blocks.
The problem I have with Gavin's patch is that it assumes Moores law holds for at least 20 years, for both storage and bandwidth. But Moores law isnt a law like the law of gravity. It's an observation taken from past observations. In fact it originally applied to the number of transistors on a CPU.

Nope, miners still get a fee - just that they get one big fee when the channel is opened, rather than lots of smaller fees when the transactions are made. That's the whole point of lightning after all.
@_date: 2015-07-05 13:12:50
Things like that are inherently dangerous because we dont know the future. For example, I have seen it suggested on another thread that some miners could form a cartel to jointly verify very large blocks and effectively lock out smaller players.  
You simply cannot rely on human behaviour, that is why we need built in safeguards in code.

@_date: 2015-07-09 20:15:16
I'll mention it again and I expect to get massively downvoted as usual for simply stating a fact.  Please observe.  
Gavin's patch includes blocksize doubling every two years for the next twenty years.  
There is a far bigger danger to decentralization from having too large blocks than from having too small blocks.
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:15:33


Because I am not the one spouting off on Reddit as if my opinion were fact. Besides it is not a "basic extension", a basic extension would be increasing the value by 10%, 20% maybe even 50%. An increase of 800% to a fundamental parameter, followed by further 200% increases every 2 years (with interpolation) is about as far from a "basic extension" as you can get.


PRECISELY ! So why exactly does Gavin's plan include max block size doubling every two years for the next twenty years ? Surely that goes entirely against "when the future arrives those problems might not exist as you expect or might be solved other ways". You are arguing against yourself !

Edit: I have been looking on Google, it seems possible that Trustonic is only in the S6. Is there some way to check for support on  a device to confirm this (other than running the Trustlet) ?
@_date: 2015-07-29 11:57:16
Not really. If we have small blocks then the transaction fees will rise towards infinity and absorb all the attackers money, after which things should return to normal. If we have large blocks then the attacker can simply fill every block to the limit and bloat the blockchain.  
It is blatantly obvious which of these is preferable.
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:16:17
Who is user: oriol ?
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:46:47
137,000 a day is still a laughable amount for an attacker willing to destroy the bitcoin network. For that price they will have achieved 20 times more network bandwidth requirement and 20 times more diskspace.  
Your idea of raising the fees to 0.0003 wont work either. As long as there is some space left in a block, it makes sense for miners to include more transactions, whatever the fee. Minimum fees can only exist where there is real competition for block space.  
The best solution is simply to let fees go up, and as the level of pain increases other solutions will be developed post haste (lighning etc), or and/or a moderate block size increase as a response to too high fees.
@_date: 2016-02-01 23:38:49
And then when Classic changes the 2 to a 4 ? They should copy that also ? And when they change 4 to 8 ? Copy it again ? And then when they remove the limit and become bitcoin unlimited ? Core should copy that too ?
@_date: 2016-02-27 18:35:51
You would see a lot of high fee blocks being orphaned and replaced by double blocks (the first one to pick up the fees and the second to get the longest chain).

IMO it is important to have some real world data about the effect of segwit before deciding the on any block size increases.
If there is no urgent need to do an increase, then it would be nice to have some data from the roll out of LN too.
@_date: 2016-02-27 18:30:36
I don't see how it would work either. Say miner a and b are both trying to mine block X with a large fee. Miner a gets the block. Miner b instead of building on top of block X, continues with their own X and tries to build X+1 on top, releasing a new X and X+1 at the same time, orphaning miner a's X. The high fee tx is in block X whichever way it goes.
@_date: 2015-07-13 12:57:09
I disagree, I think we are moving into a fresh bull market. The "Greek Bubble" was just noise. I correctly called 220 as the bottom in April, and I am calling 270 - 280 as the new bottom now.

Seems to be doing fine to me. Is there some problem with it ?
@_date: 2016-02-21 07:38:49


So that would be about 10 USD per tx, which seems high but nor unreasonable. In practice that value would be lower due to segwit and some reasonable block size increases. (To repeat: I guess this is one data point that needs to be observed before deciding the optimal block size.)
I'm not sure what the sweet spot would be for miners, perhaps around 1 - 2 dollars per tx.
Better to start getting these things sorted out now when tx fees are still relatively small compared to the block reward.

OK, that's good to know ! What I have always wondered is, why doesn't Armory make a mini database with just the relevant transaction history in it ? Then you could prune blocks and keep the history, even move to another machine and import your history to the other machine, avoiding having to rescan.
@_date: 2017-04-10 00:08:25
I would speculate that full nodes are the ones most affected by the UTXO size, since they likely need to verify more transactions than the miners. And since running a full node is already a cost, then we need to avoid anything which makes it even more costly (similar to the blocksize arguments).
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:53:30

    If there were no limit on block size, fees would not go up


Why would anyone pay more than than the minimum fee if there were no block size limit ? What would be the point ? It is up to you to you prove that they would, not the other way round.


Again, it would be an instantaneous attack, and once the attack stopped the network would recover with no permanent damage done.
Do you understand that creating extremely large blocks can be considered damage to the network ? It doesnt seem clear to me that you do.

Sure, I have been in bitcoin since 2012. IMO we are well overdue another bubble, and bubbles in BTC generally increase the price by a factor of 5 - 10 before retreating somewhat. The current price level is showing signs of seller exhaustion, it won't be long (&lt; 2 month, probably &lt; 1 month) before we move up to the next level. From there we are in striking distance of the ATH.

There is nothing wrong with profit, we are all here for that. But profiting by being destructive to the bitcoin infrastructure (in this case blocking technological advances) cannot be allowed if bitcoin is to survive.


Part of the agreement was that the miners would implement segwit. That hasn't happened, most are not even signalling for it.

You need to monitor the blockchain to make sure that the other party doesn't broadcast an earlier state of the channel and steal your funds. If that happens then you have a limited time to broadcast the current state and then you get all of the funds (yours and the counterparty's). If you can't be online all the time to monitor, then you need to employ a watchtower to do it for you.

That's great, but why not just make a normal POS card machine ? I.e. the vendor enters the value in local currency, it gets converted to BTC at current rate. The user then inserts a smart card and enters a pin, the card signs the transaction with a private key, receives the updated channel state, and the sale is done.

If you are talking about Blockstream, they fund 3 or 4 I think out of several dozen core contributors.

And I have yet to find anything which I consider malicious which said employees have done regarding Bitcoin. Perhaps you can enlighten me though.

I was watching that site a few years ago when all of I sudden somebody moved (IIRC) 30,000 bitcoins in a single transaction. Then another, then another. I was listening to the sound on headphones and it went right down into sub-base. Freaked me out so bad I almost fell off my chair.

All of the blocks are useful because you need to track the transaction path at some level - how did the coins get from the blocks which mined them to the eventual address. Even if those coins passed through now empty addresses that information is still important as a cross check to ensure the overall security of the network.

After the fork, if you move some coins on one chain, they could move on both chains. If you don't move your coins you have nothing to worry about. If you move your coins prior to the fork you also have nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:00:26
The reason for phrasing it as I did, is that the signatories behind the NYA, and (hence those driving the push for S2X) seem to be miners plus companies whose goal is profit in financial terms as well as supporters who like you feel that current transaction fees are too high. What I proposed is simply the logical conclusion as to what would (at least in the short term), benefit those groups the most. You say that you would oppose such a change on principle, yet if the S2X fork succeeds in killing Bitcoin core it will have proven that a group with less than full consensus could force a change on the whole community, which personally I view as a very dangerous step in the wrong direction.
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:59:09
Timelocked transactions. Currently NO wallet provides this potentially very useful feature.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:40:42
Ah I see what you mean yes. Still I would guess there would be some miners willing to mine at a loss to keep the original chain going. And it remains to be seen if all of the 95% who are signalling actually will switch over at the time of the fork.

To answer your first point, I looked into who are the commiters for Bitcoin Core, you can find that here:  (they call them maintainers, but it is basically the commieters role). Here is a list of Blockstream employees:  as you can see, none of the maintainers are employed by Blockstream.  
You bring up the point about how decisions are made as to what to include or not, there are various means as with any open source project. I am speaking from personal experience here, I don't want to give away too many personal details but I am a participant / contributer in a couple of large open source projects (though not Bitcoin related).  
For changes that are simply technically related normally one would just open a pull request, you can see some examples here:  Architectural changes would be discussed on IRC, the bitcoin developer mailing list, or in BIPS. regularly post the IRC logs "in laymans terms" e.g. 
 the bitcoin-dev mailing list  BIPs can be found here:   
Regarding developers and their views, take a look at the comments here  and note the date: this issue has been an argument for over 2 years, and yet still nobody has any evidence of wrong doing. The onus is now on you to prove it.  


Sure, patents can be used for attacking purposes (to prevent others from implementing the same technology), or defensively (either to prevent others from patenting that technology and attacking, or to respond in kind to other patent threats, as a form of self-defense). AFAIK Blockstream haven't used their patents to attack other implementations per the above, so thus far they have been good to their word. I con't have time to answer your other points now, but I will try to respond later as I am enjoying this discussion.  
I am curious to know why you oppose Segwit. Care to elaborate ?
@_date: 2015-04-14 15:31:25
Wut ?
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:34:39
 &gt; I see this a lot lately. What does it even mean???  
You could start by counting nodes, there are several thousand running core which are publicly available, and an estimated 95 - 100K non public nodes (including mine). How many of those do you think have switched ? There is also a significant number of users and holders (including myself) who oppose the fork. None of the current developers support the fork, except Garzik who has apparently left the project anyway to work on alt coin. But sure, if you think the fork has full consensus that is your choice.  


A small size increase was done, segwit increases the maximum block size to 4MB. Segwit was a soft fork and was supported by an overwhelming majority of the community, including 95% of the miners.  
It's technically very simple to increase the block size via a hard fork, Bitcoin Cash did exactly that in August. The problem is more political, nobody is opposed to a hard fork when the time is right, however it should be planned well in advance (e.g. 1 or 2 years ahead) and it should include more items from the hardfork wishlist (spoonnet for example). Also a one time increase in block size doesnt really help, what do you do when blocks become full again, another fork ? Then another ?  
If you read the core roadmap which was published some time ago, they talk about dynamic block size increases which would be a better solution, but only after all other scaling solutions (e.g. segwit, schnorr, MAST) have been done and the data from those has been analyzed.  
You might want to watch this, it is quite informative regarding the current situation

Wrong again ! Everyone who has the hardware to mine profitably *at the current price / hashrate* does so. If the hashrate drops but the price drops by a lesser ratio, then for some it becomes profitable to mine again.  
For example, if the bitcoin price drops by a half, and the hashrate goes down to 5%, then it becomes 10 times more profitable to mine it. As the new miners jump in, the hashrate will rise and the profitability will fall until it reaches a new equilibrium. If the hashrate goes up to 25% and price remains at half, then it is still twice as profitable to mine as it is currently.
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:50:30
Well, whether shady or not, I don't think businessmen are the right people to decide the direction of Bitcoin development. But the deal was signed behind closed doors, AFAIK none of the current developers were invited to discuss it. Several of the signers have knowingly acted against Bitcoin in the past - e.g. Jihan (asicboost), Roger Ver (there are whole threads about this). Others have admitted that the goal is not to improve Bitcoin, but rather to replace the current developers (and thereby take control of the develpment). We also know that Jeff Garzik, their main developer has a chain analytics company, and therefore is likely opposed to any privacy improving features. There is a lot more if you dig into the details and look at the other signatories / supporters and their past and present behaviour.

@_date: 2017-10-27 20:51:06
Very true. I have been saying the same on here for years.  
Another reason to oppose S2X: if that fork is successful in replacing the current Bitcoin, then most if not all of the current developers would likely leave, or be forced out. The new bitcoin "owners" would be obliged to hire new developers, who would naturally have different incentives (working for money rather than for idealistic reasons), and would be further incentivised to shape Bitcoin in the direction their employers desired.

Oh Tails is secure, but the SPV server you connect to may be logging your address lookups. I suppose it is not so bad if they can't figure out your IP address, but they could still link addresses from the same wallet.  
Most secure way is still to run your own node and use something like Armory.

Sorry to disagree but if you look at the code example Satoshi gave, it *very clearly* shows a one-time increase in max block size. There is nothing in his example code or in his posts about a constantly increasing block size limit, a la BIP101.
Obviously there is a debate to be had about block sizes, but appealing to Satoshi as support for BIP101 is just misguided.

Yes, that was the idea. You can set a timeout in blocks, and a maximum fee. The wallet software keeps increasing the fee up to the max, until the block time runs out. If the transaction can't be made within the sṕecified conditions then it will notify the user.

His paper makes a lot of unspoken and dangerous assumptions, it assumes that current mining pool conditions never change: for example if mining pools were to roll out super fast connections between each other then the orphan risk goes right down. Also as we learned from Rusty's talk: using IBLT can reduce the data transfer for blocks by up to 97%, which means blocks could be up to 30 times larger than using full block transfers with the same orphan risk.

Except that blocks might be too big for full nodes to handle. You need to check out some other videos from the workshop. For example, there is already one block which takes on average 30 seconds to validate. With bigger blocks it would possible for a bad actor to create blocks which take several minutes or even hours to validate, and cause nodes to grind to a halt.
Also with IBLT and the bitcoin relay network, miners can create huge blocks without having to worry about orphan blocks. For example IBLT can reduce block latency by up to 30 times. The same risk miners have now with 8MB blocks could soon be the risk for 256MB blocks.

That is really irrelevant. In any large open source project it is normal to restrict commits to a few members, otherwise if everybody could commit it would be chaos. It's really just an administrative role though, the commiters don' t personally decide what changes should or should not be included, that is done via BIPs, mailing lists, and so on. It's not as if a commiter could slip some malicious code into an open source project undetected.


If you are referring to block size arguments, then I believe all of the Blockstream employees are on record as holding the same views as now even before their current employment. The fact that none of the current developers (Gavin, Mike Hearn and Jeff aside) seem to support immediate block size increases then I don't see how you can argue that Blockstream is controlling the development in that direction.


I believe they hold some patents which they have pledged to only use for defensive purposes. Up till now there has been no evidence to the contrary.


I am not an expert on sidechains but I believe there are many use cases even without full blocks on the main chain. For example I think Rootstock uses sidechains for smart contracts.


I happen to agree with that, so whether or not Blockstream profits from it or not is irrelevant to me.


Aside from the fact that fixing bugs is good, it also allows for level 2 solutions on top of the main chain (not just sidechains) such as lightning. Given that there are limits to on chain scaling we will certainly need such solutions as part of overall scaling, so I am pleased that it has been fixed.

Tx count peaked at almost 130 transactions per second, and the bitcoin network handled it gracefully. I think we can safely say the 'stress test' was a success in the sense that it showed the network can comfortably handle peaks of 50x standard transaction volume.

According to your chart, time to download the blockchain is less than one hour. Your figures are way off, the last time I did a full synch it took almost 3 days. You also need to include the time to index and scan the blocks.

The transactions are larger than normal. so although the fee paid is higher, the actual fee per KB is about average. People are crying about nothing.
Also note that Slush, favourites of the XT movement, were only filling 700MB blocks during the "stress test". If they are really concerned about block size, why weren't they filling 1MB ?
@_date: 2015-09-06 12:25:53
a) the main things negatively affecting the probability of a rally were: the possibility of XT forking, and the coinwallet.eu stress tests. Now that those threats appear to have receded, a rally can take place any time.
b) regarding the core devs: there is the scalability workshop in Montreal next weekend. I expect that a lot of ideas will be discussed and refined over the next few weeks. There is a second workshop in Hong Kong in December and I would imagine that a final decision will be taken then. There is certainly no need to panic.

We are arguing different things here. 


There you go again. I thought we were talking about OB but now you are jumping back to the blockchain...
...the blockchain - I'm not arguing that we have the most efficient way of verifying transactions. I am arguing that we have developed the most efficient way of doing it TRUSTLESSLY. I don't know how many times I need to keep saying that.
Regarding OB - as we agree, there is a part of it which requires assigning trust, and that is, verifying contracts. I already agreed that for this one case a centralised (or semi centralised) solution may be necessary.


I suppose you could say "genetic modification" which doesn't always produce the desired effects or has unwanted side-effects.


Actually I have a Masters in genetic and evolutionary algorithms, so I believe I am qualified to speak about these things.

I think you are missing the point. If 95% of the current hash power switches over to 2X, then the 1x chain won't remain at 5%. New miners will jump in to mine the 1x chain and the hash rate on that chain will go up.

Not really, it seems like IBLT would be mainly useful for miners, who would (presumably) have most transactions already in their mempools. I guess it would be less efficient for nodes, who might only see part of the transactions.
Personally I would like to see more studies done, if indeed it can reduce the bandwidth requirements for nodes then that makes the case for big blocks look more positive (although of course it does nothing for storage requirements).

Impossible. After numerous attempts, I still couldn't get more than 15 or 16 coins out of 30 on mission 2. If you are going to make a game that relies on clicking things fast, at least make the clicking accurate. I had to click several times around each coin to FINALLY get it to register. For some I was just clicking and clicking and they never registered, even after  zooming right up to them.
Also it would have been nice to have an "Exit" option from the game too. I had to actually reboot my phone to get out of it.  
Nice idea, but an awful game.

I think it is fine....BUT....we shouldn't increase block size just to cater to blockchain companies. It's more important to retain decentralization than it is to draw in new business, so we should proceed with caution when deciding how to scale bitcoin. In particular this is true whilst alternative channels (like lightning networks) are not yet fully developed.
The blockchain needs to serve bitcoin the currency first and foremost, since that is what we all invested in, and then and only then if there is spare capacity it can be used for other purposes.

To be strictly accurate, there really aren't coins. There are inputs and outputs to a transaction, and the size of those inputs and outputs is measured in units called "bitcoins". Equivalently, there is no such thing as "a kilo", however there are things which have a mass of one kilo ;D

All pools are different, but to use your analogy with dice - rather than throwing a dice and looking at the top face, in a pool, each user would be sent a few different (unseen) faces on the dice to check, to see if they have the target number (a value below a certain threshold). Each user looks at the faces they have been sent and checks the value. When somebody finds a face that fits, that is used to sign the block, and the pool gets the reward. Then generally the reward is divided up proportional to how many faces you checked.

What if, for example he wanted to buy a house from a guy who hated Europeans. And he had some funds in euros. OK, so in this ridiculous example the vendor wont accept his euros even if changed to dollars (thats the analogy here). So the buyer changes euros to gold and then sells the gold. Yes, he is doing this to obscure that the money originally was in Euros, but what is the crime ? He isnt obscuring it for ctiminal reasons, but simply to get around the prejudice of the vendor.

@_date: 2015-09-24 12:31:02
It's about storing data by default. Every time you make a transaction on the blockchain, that transaction is transmitted and then stored on thousands of computers around the world. Those other computers bear the cost of transmitting and storing that (as small as it may be, yet en masse they all add up to gigabytes and eventually terabytes). What the company pays is just a miner's fee (currently around 2 cents) for perpetual, distributed, secure data storage. That's a great deal for Fidelity, but a bad deal for anyone running a full node.
@_date: 2015-09-01 12:23:18

Nope, there is a single standard (POSIX) and several kernels which follow this standard (eg. GNU/ Linux, FreeBSD. They are general compatible in terms of code portability.

@_date: 2015-09-21 10:59:32
You must have had a block source on disk already otherwise it is impossible. I did a sync a couple of weeks ago and whilst it was fairly quick with an on disk block source, once it starts synching from the network you only get one block every 10 - 12 seconds, because of rate limiting by clients I think. FWIW I am on a 35Mbs link but blocks never ever download quicker than this.  
Also SSD is expensive. It might be OK whilst the blockchain size is tiny like we have now, but if we go to 8MB blocks next year, then by 2017 the blockchain size could be around 400GB. Will that still fit on your SSD ?
@_date: 2015-09-28 18:06:26
About a month ago after a hard drive crash. I managed to recover 2/3 of the blocks from disc, so those were just reindexed. The remaining 1/3 had to be downloaded and reindexed. This was with version 0.10 of bitcoin core. It may have been a little less than 3 days, perhaps around 60 hours.
If you havent synched recently you may be in for a shock. The last 1/3 which was downloaded are just the transactions from this year.
@_date: 2015-09-10 00:36:15
A little off-topic for this, but a major bottleneck seems to be synching nodes to bring them up to date. If my node needs to catch up, I only get around 10 - 12 blocks per minute, so 1000 blocks (about a week's worth) takes almost 2 hours. In tests which I ran synching from on-disk block sources, it seems only about 10 - 20% of this time is due to disk io and indexing. This seems like something that could be improved by having specialised well connected nodes which just serve historic blocks, then once a node is up to date it can switch over to peer nodes.  I can see a future market there for super fast SPV / blockchain nodes.

Perhaps I mis-stated then. Centralized solutions can be the most efficient in a somewhat restricted and artificial set of circumstances. E.g. when you trust the central body, when the rules are clear so that they can be independently verified etc.
Claiming that centralization is *always* more efficient is obviously false, as is the other claim by OP that decentralised solutions are super-inefficient.

Looking at tradeblocks now, it seems like the standard minimum fee of 0.1 mBTC per transaction works out at 38 - 58 per KB. So 45 is well within the normal range (may knock out just a few larger txs paying min fee.)
@_date: 2015-09-10 16:41:28
OK, so here is a transaction showing some of the addresses they were using which I found by watching on Tradeblocks:   
It seems like the inputs for this were prepared on 2 Sep. (What we thought was the earlier stress test may have actually been these guys preparing addresses). As can be seen, over 4,000 dust transactions were sent to each of the feed (input) addresses. And then 500 of those outputs were sent today to a single address in a 73KB transaction.
@_date: 2015-09-02 20:54:39
The transactions were much bigger, so although the fees were higher, fees per KB were at the minimum level.
Looking at the transactions, it was clear that they were sending dust amounts to dozens of addresses. If the miners have to drop some transactions, wouldn't you prefer they drop these kind of transactions as opposed to dropping say transactions with a single output plus change ?
Another interesting thing of note. Slush, who supposedly support large blocks were only filling 700KB blocks during the stress tests. If they are really concerned about blocks being too small, why weren't they using the current maximum block size limit ?

Looks like they hash around 20% of blocks, so the probability that they have 6 blocks in a row is 0.2 * 0.2 * 0.2 * 0.2 * 0.2 * 0.2 * 0.2 which should happen roughly every 4 months. I guess they just got lucky today.

I am not sure if it does it in parallel, I guessed not because at one point when I was downloading, there was a long pause, then I saw a message like "timed out getting blocks from peer" and it seemed to switch to another peer and speed up again.
You could be right about counting percentages - I was assuming that percentage count was for txs but if it is for blocks instead then it is possible since earlier blocks are less full.
Another data point though - one time I found the IP address of a very fast host, and starting the client I connected to it. I was able to download blocks about 3 or 4 times faster than normal using only the node at that address.

So just as a thought experiment, if the B2X signatories decided to waive transaction fees altogether, in exchange for unlimited block size and no more reward halvings, would you be in favour of that ?
@_date: 2015-09-14 13:18:36
It wouldn't really help because you need all blocks to index them.
@_date: 2015-09-23 19:26:55
Hmm...well nothing yet...
@_date: 2015-09-10 10:32:33
No, as I mentioned I checked with blocks which were already on disk. Reindexing took only about 10 - 20 % of the time (roughly, I counted the time to complete 1%. It was about 1 hour with an external source and about 5 - 10 minutes with blocks which were already on disk. I was counting percentage, not blocks - obviously.) So, yes reindexing is slow but it doesnt explain all of the delay. I believe more likely that peers are rate limiting their sending of prior blocks. This makes sense to prevent network attacks (i.e. fake peers always requesting the same blocks over and over).
Actually, one thing that could be implemented to speed things up, I think: it seems like downloading is done from one node only. It might be possible to download from all connected nodes in parallel, and just cache the blocks which are not yet verified. That would be a lot more complicated though - you need to take into account that some peer connections are faster than others and then task the slower peers with downloading blocks which are further in the future from where you are, in order to give them time to do their work.
@_date: 2015-09-02 15:26:16
And if we had 8MB blocks it could have increased by 800MB instead.

Isn't that kind of defeating the object of segwit ? Otherwise you might as well just increase the block size to 4MB.


Seems like I will be sticking with my current version of core then, since the new version doesn't implement the behaviour I was expecting. Once there is a setting to not store witness data &gt; a specific age, I will likely upgrade.

~~ITT: Portuguese people are jelly.~~
@_date: 2016-10-27 01:44:22
It's not just a matter of increasing the block size, it is also how it is done. Just making the block size bigger would require a hard fork, which would mean every node on the network would need to upgrade. This is considered a bad idea unless it is planned well in advance (at least a year or so).
There is also a technology called Segwit, which is due to be released in about 3 weeks. It will eventually result in the same effect as increasing the block size to about 1.75MB. It does this without a hard fork by making the transactions smaller in effect so that more will fit in the same block. Because it doesnt need a hard fork, older nodes will continue running fine (though they wont be able to send or receive segwit transactions themselves).
@_date: 2016-10-24 12:25:33
The payments show up as "anyone can spend" addresses. But if the client tries to spend it then the miners and updated nodes will reject the transaction.
@_date: 2016-10-23 05:29:56
The miners should support it for technical reasons - i.e. the 95% is to indicate when they are ready with testing etc. Not for dumb political reasons (e.g. deliberately trying to block progress to harm bitcoin, or because for some reason you don't like a small subset of the developers).

Yes even Gavin admits that Bitcoin cannot / will not be able to handle every single transaction. Yet he still tries to shoehorn bitcoin into a huge block mode, which is likely the worst of both worlds.

So basically you are fine with the blockchain forking. OK.
@_date: 2015-09-10 12:33:05
Actually it might be. If we get BIP 101, then the max block size in 2025 will be approximately 165MB, the block chain will be growing at up to 9TB per year and will have a total size up to about 30TB.
Assuming you make backups (so using twice the space), one of these disks will last you until about the end of 2027, when the block size max will be approx. 334MB and the blockchain will be anywhere up to 60TB.
You are welcome to do your own calculations in case I made a mistake in mine.

I had a similar experience. I found out about Bitcoin in 2011 via Slashdot. Started mining and after about 24 hours I managed to melt the CPU on my machine. That put me off for a bit until 2012 when I decided to buy a few coins, initially as a hedge against inflation.

UK house prices are already in a bubble, and have been for over a decade. There are already signs of the property market crashing - starting with the top end in London as there is less demand post Brexit referendum. The question is whether it will work its way down the market. 
The pound crashing will only cause upwards pressure if foreign buyers want to purchase UK property.
@_date: 2016-10-23 14:13:56
Sure. The bigger blocks become, the more expensive it becomes to run a full node (due to bandwidth and storage costs). A healthy bitcoin ecosystem relies on having as many nodes run by as many different people as possible. For example it wouldn't be good to have most nodes controlled by one company. The best way to ensure this is to make it as cheap as possible to run a full node. Hence, increasing the block size should be done as a last resort, once all other solutions have been implemented.

The Fidelity effect is a strawman argument. Increasing the blockchain limit just so a company can use the blockchain to store date is not at all helpful for Bitcoin the currency. In fact it is net negative, since everybody running a node is forced to propogate and store that data, increasing bandwidth and network costs without a corresponding compensation.

a) there are no valid technical reasons to oppose segwit that I am aware of  
b) segwit allows for more transaction throughput and enables lightning - both of which reduce or possibly remove the need for an immediate block size update, thus making alternative clients which seek to implement this irrelevant.  
Considering both these facts leads me to the unavoidable conclusion that opposition to segwit is purely political in nature.

The way I read it is that hard forks may be necessary, but they should be deliberately difficult to do. That's different to saying there should never be hardforks - not as you say, arguing that ALL hard forks are bad, but that the mechanism to do them should be difficult.

There are various ways to estimate it, for example you could say it is proportional to the square of the number of users, or probably equivalently proportional to the transaction rate. Or you could look it on a use-case basis and say for example bitcoin represents an x percent share of the remittance market + x percent of the financial asset market, etc. Any of these indicators point to the future value of BTC being significantly higher than the current dollar price.

Neither of you responding read my response very carefully.

1) Sure that could be a nice gesture - the relatives send a few bits to the address of a deceased person, thus making everyone still living a bit richer. Kind of a last gesture of goodwill.  I doubt it would happen any time soon but maybe in a few centuries...
2) I doubt you would run out of BTC, because as they become rarer the value rises, so each generation would "burn" relatively less BTC. Also if you believe God is omniscient then you could send BTC to any address, and since God could just guess the private key (s)He could simply spend them any time (s)He wanted.
3) Heaven doesnt exist, so I wouldnt worry about this. However in future it might be more common to cryogenically freeze people so they would need a good few BTC to live off when they get thawed out eventually.  
4) Why would bother, you would be dead, so why would you care ? However, if you believe in reincarnation you could put some coins in a brain wallet and then hope that your future incarnation can recover the wallet password by past life regression hypnosis.

You are correct. In fact, if anything, customers would have been selling their stuck BTC for fiat and withdrawing that - indeed the prices on the Chinese exchanges was substantially lower. Now the reverse is true, Chinese will be re-buying BTC now that there are no restrictions on withdrawing them.

But the block size will need to increase eventually any, right ? Even with segwit and LN. So how do you plan to achieve that without an eventual hard fork ?
Edit: uh, what ? Downvoted for asking a question ? Seriously ?
@_date: 2015-03-15 11:13:33
Somebody answered this above. There are methods which allow you to do calculations which do not require breaking the encryption. In this case it would be something like:  
if (encrypted_value(a) &lt;= encrypted_value(b)) allow_transaction();

What you are referring to is 2 of 3 multisig.  
For escrow you would use 2 of 2 multisig. Basically: - the seller sends the goods. The site signs to release the funds from escrow, the buyer also signs to release the funds. Funds are released and sent to the seller.  
In case the site disappears, they can't get at the funds in escrow because they only have one of the 2 keys.  
The only problem would be if the buyer refused to sign after receiving the goods. They could screw the seller over, but it would cost them the funds in escrow to do so.
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:20:09


...or via a commandline option. I don´t see what the problem is.
@_date: 2015-11-18 02:26:23
But it's not really decentralized - 21 inc will decide which transactions go into the block and all of their miners will mine it.

Nope, reasonable Bitcoiners like myself favour SegWit as a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:37:12
Weren't they mostly about segwit being activated there ? Which is a technology intimately related to Bitcoin also; hence it is relevant to this sub.

OK. Well I was just guessing/speculating anyway :-P   
But it seems like it would still require trust on the part of the buyers - the site could be in collusion with (or even be) a fake seller and steal the buyers money. I think this was already mentioned above.

I would agree with you if there were a free market in currencies, unfortunately that is not the case - state issued currencies are given unfair advantages through things like legal tender laws.

I don't see how it solves anything relating to nodes (which is the most serious problem for centralization). It doesn't reduce either the blockchain storage requirements or the bandwidth required to verify transactions. In fact it would likely make these two problems worse.

Sure they are, but you need to be a bit smart to see it. Raising the fees helps to keep the blockchain size down, which means it can be run on more nodes, which in turn ensures that bitcoin can remain healthy and decentralised. This in turn benefits all bitcoin users indirectly.

Nope. But the shops were all shut anyway, since the tills and card readers were all down, so I wasn't able to spend fiat currency either.


Nope. Neither did it increase the value of my fiat currency.


Fair point, but it merely serves to illustrate that the extrinsic value of a currency is defined by individual perceptions.
But we were talking about intrinsic value, which can be defined by such features as security, scarcity, divisibility, durability, utility, and in the case of gold for example, industrial / commercial use. In fact the only point you can argue is that utility is greater for fiat currency during specific and rare events (power outages) which is debatable in itself as I have shown, because Bitcoin flat out wins in all other areas I have mentioned.

I wouldn't trust BCash's replay protection. I would advise making sure you send your coins to an address you control, until they are definitively split.  
There is a simpler way to split them, which I plan to do:  
- buy a small amount of split BTC.  
- send them to a wallet you control  (wait for it to confirm)
- transfer the total amount to a new address  
- the new address will now contain split BTC coins, the split BCC will remain in the old wallet address since the transaction on that chain will be rejected (insufficient balance).  
- voila, split coins

Yes I saw that, OK it might not be required to use the site, but as you say it is required to use all of the features. Now I am a legitimate bitcoiner with nothing to hide but it seems to me to be going a bit far. I don't know of any other site that requires this, except I think bitcoin.de for users just in Germany. It just screams to me "amateurs", like you don't actually know anything about AML/KYC, but you are just doing what you think needs to be done and actually going further than you need to.  And add to this you are making a real honeypot for thieves / hackers - a database of bitcoiners with names, ID, addresses and pictures of their faces. Anyone who trades serious amounts of bitcoin is going to think the same way I think I would imagine.

That's a bit of a handwavey argument. If the number of transactions quadruples, then we would need &gt; 4MB blocks, if it goes up 8 times then even 8MB blocks would start filling. But ti's unlikely to grow by so much overnight, and by the time it reaches such levels then alternate solutions like LN should be ready. So yeah, I would say 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 8 is a good solution in that allows for growth on the blockchain whilst stiill incentivising off chain solutions.

It would be a sad thing if the only contribution Bitcoin made was instant payments.

Correct I think.
at step 3: PREFORK BALANCE = 11 BTC (split), 10 BCH (split)
- send all 11 coins minus fee to POSTFORK BTC
- wait for it to confirm on the BTC blockchain !
- send 10 coins to POSTFORK BCH wallet
on the final step, you can simply make a normal transfer of 10 BCH.

OK, here's the thing. I have looked at a couple of multi-sig systems, namely yours and coinbase vault. The problem I see with both is that I have to trust that you are not storing my part of the key or my password. Now, in your FAQ I see the following: "Why do I need to save my Keycard?
In order to ensure the highest protection of your Bitcoin holdings, 2 of your 3 keys are created in your browser and BitGo never sees them." Now that is great, BUT if that is the case then I would like to run this part of the process on an offline machine so I can be absolutely sure nobody is listening in to the key generation. So, I would like to get some javascript that I can save on a pendrive, take to my offline machine, run on there, and save the encrypted pdf back on the pendrive. That is the only way I personally would trust a multi-sig vault.  
It may be possible to do this by messing around with the javascript and saving it somehow, but what I am looking for is a wallet service that offers this in easy way. I think it is great that you are offering the multisig service but until I find somethng like what I described I wont be using any serivce, multi sig or otherwise.  
I am pretty sure it wouldnt take much to implement this, just offering the javascript program as a separate download, but it would make all the difference in the world to me.

@_date: 2015-10-12 15:18:43
I don't know about the core devs. but I would define anything which isn't a bitcoin financial transaction as spam. The bitcoin blockchain was designed for recording only such financial transactions, and that is what I and many others have invested in. There is nothing in the whitepaper about using the bitcoin blockchain for storing documents, or other non-bitcoin transactions. There is also a real cost for transactions to be recorded in the blockchain, in addition to the proof-of-work (mining) costs which are currently subsudized, there is bandwidth to send the transaction (in real time, and when synching a new node), and also in storage space. I certainly don't believe we should increase the block size just to accommodate these non-financial transactions. It seems to me like there would be no limit to this, the bigger block size we had the more uses people and companies would come up with for using up that space. And I dont subscribe to peter_r's naive view that orphan risks keep block sizes small, as this can easily be bypassed by things like IBLT and the bitcoin backbone network.
But certainly nothing is blocked, if a large enough tx fee is paid then any transaction should be included in the next block.

I am sure somebody will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that segwit addresses start with a different digit - like "normal" addresses start with a "1" and p2sh / multisigs start with a "3". The new digit indicates that the sig is held in a separate structure. Older clients just see these as normal addresses that anybody can spend from.

One thing I like about the Trezor is that you can have multiple PINS, each of which opens a separate wallet. So in the event of being forced to hand over your coins you can simply open the wallet with fewer coins in. Something similar is also possible with the Ledger, although in that case you need to create seperate seeds and reset the device to get to a different wallet.  
It would be great to have this built in to Blue - in a similar way to the Trezor - a single seed but multiple PINS to open various wallets.

The point is the witness data can be pruned for storage and during sync. You might use a bit more bandwidth running a full client, but segWit was already a compromise with the big-blockers. I'll probably choose not to store the historic witness data so for me the blocksize increase is irrelevant.

@_date: 2017-05-24 11:54:35
They are saying yes to segwit *if it gets 80%*, which Jihan can block permanently. Also a 2MB block increase is just stupid. Segwit alone will do almost that, and when we do eventually increase the block size via a hardfork, a simple extra 1MB likely wont be enough - also a hardfork should be planned much longer than 6 months in advance, it should also include as much as possible from the hardfork wishlist.
So in (very brief) summary we probably wont ever get segwit, we will get a rushed block size increase via hf, which will probably then lead to a series of hf block size increases whenever the miners / corporates feel like it. Users / devs will have no say in this.
Of course I could be wrong, Jihan and co could be doing this out of the goodness of their hearts.

I think it was the result of a bug in bitcoind, something like you could put in a hugely negative amount of coins, but when the miners fee was subtracted it became hugely positive.  I wasn't around in bitcoin land at the time, so I don't know for sure how it was handled, but yeah I presume they got people to stop making transactions, fixed the bug and then rolled back the block containing the transaction plus subsequent blocks.
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:50:57
That depends. Some online wallets give you the private keys so if anything happens you can always recover your funds. One example is blockchain.info (make sure you make backups though !).  
But it is good practice to store only a small part of your funds online, and keep the rest in cold storage (paper wallet or whatever).

You can follow each and every coin on the Blockchain. Next question ?
@_date: 2015-03-18 04:58:34
You generate one of the sigs (the user key) yourself (ideally on an offline machine).  This key is never sent out.
The site generates a second key.  
The third key is a shared key which is stored by you and on the site but can only be unlocked by you using a password.  
For normal operation, you use the site key + the shared key and your password. 
If you want to recover your funds,  you use the shared key plus the user key.
A man in the middle could at best get the site key plus the shared key, but without your password the shared key is useless.

Edit: I think we should stop with the good news, and go back to "China bans Bitcoin". Back when China was busy banning bitcoin, the price was over $800. Now we have coinbase, circle, microsoft, dell, bitsquare, the nasdaq, fidor, regulator certainy in NY, Hong Kong and other places and hundreds of ATMS around the world plus thousands of physical stores and 10s of thousands of online merchants and the price can barely keep over $200.

I think segWit proper can only lock in after a full 2 week period of signalling &gt; 95%. The next period starts in about a week, + 2 weeks to lock in. Current miner code just forces them to signal for segWit by orphaning non-segwit blocks.

It can start as soon as the devs release it. It's already been tested for over 6 months. Most wallets are already ready or are in the process of implementing it (for most it is just a library update). Miners could implement it overnight. Technically we are ready to go.  
What will take a little longer of course is market penetration, probably you could say about 6 months for the majority of waller users to upgrade.  
But we should be starting it now. Antpool has probably been hijacked by big blockers who are out to destroy bitcoin. If they really wanted to increase transaction rates then they would be rolling out segwit as soon as they could.

The blockchain is just a record, it cannot check anything.   *Nodes* on the bitcoin network check each transaction as it is broadcast, to make sure it is valid, if it is not valid then they will not transmit it to other nodes. Miners are also nodes so they do the same thing and check each transaction they receive before including it in a block.  
After a block has been signed, the transactions in it are checked again, and if any are invalid then the block will be rejected and not get added to the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:57:42
They also have to reject non segWit blocks.

Actually, the Core Roadmap is quite clear about it: 
"Finally--at some point the capacity increases from the above may not
be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them."

No that is exactly what should happen. Fees should become absurdly high for a couple of blocks, and the spammer will waste all their money filling those 2 blocks. The system then returns to normal and the spam attack is gone.
The problem we have now, is simply that the spammers arent willing to pay enough in fees to be included in a block, and yet their failed transactions are being held in the mempool.

Thanks, this is something I have been looking around for for a while. Yes I agree with pretty much all you have said.




Yes, either this or broadcast it with nlocktime / cltv and allow a double spend to cancel it.
 &gt; I also suppose cancelling wouldn't require 2FA while changing the delay would always require 2FA.
Yes, and you could also put the same delay on changing it - so for example if my delay is 48 hours, and I want to change it to something else, it takes 48 hours before the change takes effect.


I was thinking of this more from a security point of view - if somebody forces you to send coins to another account, then you would have a grace period in which to try and reverse the transaction. Having thought it through now, I am not sure it would make much difference, the thief could just make sure to prevent you sending a cancellation...so maybe it is not such a great idea. 
The other reason would be if somebody got hold of your credentials and spent your coins behind your back. Then you would have a chance to stop the transfer, but you would need to send a few emails as warnings, but I suppose the thief could delete those. 
So perhaps it's not so ideal as it first appears from a security standpoint.

Do you have a source for this 600,000 ? That's the first I have heard of it.
Edit: I followed your link and it is an old article from 2013. I believe they may have overestimated greatly the number of coins, and probably the 30,000 is all he had, since there has been nothing more said about the 600,000 since.
Regarding the remaining 60,000 + 30,000 coins, the USMS has already stated that they will be auctioning them off Q1 this year. The schedule won't be affected by the outcome of the trial.
@_date: 2016-07-31 16:09:42
This is most likely due to slower blocks following the recent halving. Fees should go back down at the next diff change in about 3 days.

@_date: 2017-06-24 07:38:23
Not really, I think we are just pausing while segWit, UASF, segWit2x and so on sort themselves out. If the miners activate segWit, expect the price to jump. If UASF fork is avoided expect another increase. If the contentious 2MB hard fork can be defused, then the sky is the limit.
@_date: 2016-07-29 12:27:05
That is not possible with Ledger. The app sends the tx to the ledger to be signed, and the ledger selects 4 digits at random from the destination address. You need to enter the corresponding codes from the keycard, otherwise the tx wont get signed. So if the web app changes the address you will know since the challenge values will be incorrect.

I hope one of the things that you look into is timed multi sig (vault) withdrawals (i.e. user makes a withdrawal request, and the transaction is made e.g. 48 hours later, with the possibility of cancelling the transaction in the meantime). It would be a great security feature to have. I haven't seen any wallets that offer this service yet.

If this is true and we do get segWit then I applaud it for that. Regarding the hard fork, I am dubious about it - I don't believe 3 months or even 6 months is long enough to prepare for it. I would prefer a longer planned hardfork, with as many of the items from the hardfork wishlist as possible. A hardfork just to 2MB seems like either a waste at best or at worst the start of a slippery slope to wrest control away from the developers and the users of the system.

Wouldn't it be more productive to start a campaign to persuade exchanges to implement Lightning wallets for their users instead ? Then rather than removing your coins, you could lock them into a channel.
This would achieve the same effect on a more permanent basis, halve the fees (because otherwise you have to tx the coins back to sell them), and also help to improve the LN at the same time.
Plus if you wanted to sell you could just transfer some of those coins back to the exchange via lightning.

Segwit and a pony, as I like to call it.
@_date: 2016-07-28 11:18:21


Yes, true !


It came from my original thought - delay as a security measure - if somebody malicious was forcing you to make a transaction against your will they could also try to force you to reduce the sending delay. But again like I realised yesterday, it' s probably not worth it as the thief could either just shoot you or keep you tied up until the delay had passed anyway.

Unfortunately things like this only work if you consider the Bitcoin economy in isolation. In fact if you examine the wider picture you would note the danger that some outside agency could pay a Jihan to produce as large blocks as possible, filling them with 'fake' transactions as necessary.

If this is a minority chain and only producing one block per hour then fees will be huge to get into blocks. The risk is then that this tx gets confirmed on legacy chain and you end up paying the same huge fee there.
However once some coins are already split it becomes easier, e.g
- create 2 wallets, legacy and bip148
- receive some legacy coins in the legacy wallet and some bip148 coins in the bip148 wallet
- get a receiving address in one wallet, and import it into the other so both wallets have the same address
- send unsplit coins to the new address, wait for it to confirm on both chains
- finally, send all coins in each wallet to a fresh wallet. This will mix the split coins with the unsplit ones.
