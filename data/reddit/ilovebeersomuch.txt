I am so confused. How do people make money from day trading with alts if BTC is dropping? For example, if I buy 500 LTC and BTC drops significantly, I cant sell my LTC because BTC is less valuable?

Watch it hit 16k this month. Then everyone is going to resurrect it and be like “meh he was only a month off, close enough”

60m was spent to keep the death cross from happening. Big players out there want the halving narrative to play out.

What is the best mobile app to track prices? Seems like none of them are real time.

Is there a widget for iOS that displays coin prices quickly, rather than opening an app? Coinbase’s widget does this (scroll once to the left from the home screen) but it only shows 3 coins max. Is there another app out there that has a widget that can display multiple coin prices?

Unrelated question - is there a way to lock an EMA trendline? For example, i want to use a weekly trendline on a daily chart?

Noob here. People say to get a wallet for security and no to keep bitcoin in any of the exchanges, but how do traders handle their bitcoin? Are they only keeping just what they want to trade with? I see some traders making very large trades. Do they move it to their wallets as soon as they are finished trading?

Noob question. I just transferred USD to coinbase pro. I want to set up an automatic buy if the BTC price hits $7,500. Is this possible? If so, how?
