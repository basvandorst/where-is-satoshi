The Coldcard wallet only manages Bitcoins. But, as far as I know, it is the only hardware wallet that can be fully offline. You can use it on line (with Electrum) easily. As Electrum is free software, you can check it.
The offline way is pretty neat:
1. Create a transaction in Electrum,
2. save it on a sdcard,
3. put the sdcard in the Coldcard,
4. plug the Colcard on a phone charger,
5. sign the transaction on the Coldcard (it displays the addresses),
6. put back the sdcard in the computer,
7. load the signed transaction in Electrum,
8. broadcast it!
The signing process took place in a fully offline device. Electrum only holds a watch-only wallet. This watch-only wallet can be created when the Coldcard is plugged to the computer OR created offline on the sdcard.
This means it's possible to use a Coldcard **without** connecting the Coldcard to a computer.

Here's a command line with vanitygen (rev. 2212312) searching for bitcoin addresses ending by *123*. It tooks less than a second for find an address. Of course, the longer the *postfix* the longer the time. It's the same time as for the *prefix*.
`$ time ./vanitygen -r '123$'`
`Pattern: 123$`

This one-liner using Python does the trick. Ensure to have Python-mnemonic available and type in this:
`echo "12 15 18 21 24? ";read N &amp;&amp; echo "import mnemonic as m; print(m.Mnemonic('english').generate($N*32//3))"|python3`

It may be possible to generate the bip39 seed on your computer, and then import the wallet in the ColdCard. So the (perhaps) faulty RNG shan't be used.
