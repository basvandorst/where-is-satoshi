By lately do you mean forever? Planet money has been my go-to since the TARP! Such a great show.

Inflation and deflation is not just the money supply, it's the supply compared to the output of goods and services a country produces. Bitcoin becomes deflationary at the level of economic growth, not the level of coin loss. If the economy is growing and the money supply is staying the same, the value of 1btc relative to the output of the economy increases, which is deflationary

People like you just don't understand what the others are saying; what the purpose and functions of a CB are. And because you don't understand, you chalk it up to a cult conspiracy

Idk about Central Banks globally, but the US Federal Reserve publishes meeting minutes, which I've extensively read in the past. It's funny how everyone is acting like this is new when they've been doing it for near a decade and being very open and honest about it.
Truth is a lot of people in this sub want the economy to crash so that their BTC is seen as more stable and valuable, so that they'll profit, so of course they're anti central bank. They want to buy Lambos but will not have well kept up roads to drive them on.

So you're implying the government is purposely devaluing all money as a tax? A tax where value literally disappears, it doesn't go to anything like roads or schools, like taxes normally do?

Your example uses 20% inflation, which is hyperinflation and obviously bad. The reason a 2% inflation level is targeted is because deflation can lead to a deflationary cycle which is very bad, so a 2% level of inflation provides a buffer. If we experience a small deflationary event, inflation goes from say 2% to 0.5%, and the buffer does it's job. If we foolishly attempt to keep inflation at 0%, that same event causes -1.5% inflation, which is deflation, and can cause disastrous effects. 2% inflation is not even noticeable to the average person.

Central Banks = Conspiracy dude, there's no other way around it. 
If any of them seemed to understand basics I would love a debate, but I've literally never seen someone on Reddit that was anti-CB and actually understood why CBs do what they do (and what the alternatives are)

$0 were "printed". Please research repo market prior to freaking out. It's unusual but definitely not insane
