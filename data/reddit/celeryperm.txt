Easiest / most convenient I’ve found is Coinbase.
However it will most probably start you with a $200 / week limit. After a month or so it will increase to $2000!

Bitcoin hitting 10,000 quite simply means “One Bitcoin is worth $10,000”
(I’m not sure the extent as to what your friend knows)

Ah I have no idea haha. I think just $!

Alot of people i've talked to out of the scene know of "Bitcoin" &amp; "ethmuorium or something?" - so I definitely agree on your theory OP!
