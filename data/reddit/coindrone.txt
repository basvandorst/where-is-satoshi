If even the opposition sees Bitcoin taking over, how much longer before we get to the last step? 
 • First, they ignore you.
 • Then they laugh at you.
 • Then they fight you.
 • Then they join you.
 • Then you win.

It was a combination of things, but to keep the list short:
• Based on math.
• Unstoppable by any of today's methods.
• Could be easily spread all over the world.

Halving is built into the Bitcoin protocol by the maker. The mining reward halves around every four years. The next halving event comes up next May.

Have a nice day. I understood.
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:28:07
The next halving comes in May. Since most people do not keep up with this, they do not know what has always happened after the last two "halvenings". 
The prices went up both times within (edited) 18 months. Read about it here:
Edit: The price of Bitcoin in January of 2012 was around seven dollars. Around one year later the price was $1000 dollars. During the second halving, in July of 2016, Bitcoin had a price of $647 dollars. One year and six months later the price rocketed to around $20,000 dollars USD.

You have been right. Even Wall Street trades in Bitcoin now.

National recognition of an asset is a pretty good indicator. Japan also recognizes Bitcoin as a currency / legal form of payment.

It is the logical step in the evolution of money. We have gone from using gold and silver as money, to paper fiat money, to plastic cards and now Bitcoin.
It was time for it to arrive. It did. Now here we are.

Using the secret number with a random number still gives the number of digits of the [random secret](
It would be super hard to figure out, but knowing how many digits to start with is still a hint on where to start.

With a number of the size given, it probably would not be worth it to start guessing. So far, it is nearly bullet-proof.

This. The name "Lightning" should be the thing that gives people a clue how fast it is.

BTC did not get weaker. The USD got a bit stronger on the world markets because they did some "easing". ...printing up more bills.

Centralized exchanges, when they get big enough, become targets for hackers. 
I have not checked it out yet, but have heard of "Bisq". It is decentralized.

This is not legal advice, but it is probably okay to put the crypto in a trust or under some other instrument that is not taxable. 
Ask a lawyer, because I know very little about the subject. There are probably ways to remain in good stead with the government and also be in control of crypto.

How much was the escrow fee?
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:07:16
Which exchanges do you use to determine the; "market mid"? 
It would be interesting to see the difference, in the averages between them and "Bisq".
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:16:48
Interesting. You sound like you are in  "forex". 
I saw today that two exchanges had a $500 dollar difference in their top "24 average" price. It looks like an "easy deal" today to just change exchanges.

Perhaps because its hard to get inflation to go lower than the south pole.
Seriously, in a country where inflation hit 1600 per cent, then 13,000 (thousand) per cent, then [833,997 percent]( , how have you guys not found the bottom yet?

Reddit is designed that way, as far as the "one person", "one vote" method.
Decentralization is the mysterious "goal" of communism and socialism. The way it nearly always ends up is the exact opposite.
The one doing the preaching (of making the life of the poor "easier") makes the most money and has total control.

The lowest price that people will accept for BTC has also been going up - that means ↑

The other option is even worse. Case in point: your neighbor *Venezuela*. 
True, you have to fight in either realm, Democracy or Socialism/Communism. There is much more of a chance of getting what you want done with elected officials than without them.
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:28:44


Because they are in charge. I have no idea if you live in/under a democratically elected government or not. 
If you live in a country that has free and fair elections, you have the right to protest, to make change with your vote and your voice.
If you live in a communist country, those types of rights do not exist for you.

I can see that. Money is made to be used. Transactions need to happen. The preservation of wealth should be tied up in other things like, perhaps, investments.

You gave me an idea. Prepare about 1000 copies of Bitcoin (under different names) and have the bankers buy us out 1000 times. Good times!

And so we also get to "bonds"... investing in something a bit bigger than companies. To do that, the disposable wealth you spoke of... is important.
But...43% of Americans can't afford food and rent. Income inequality is the highest in history. And science tells us that when a person gets wealthier, that person also gets more out of touch with humanity. 
What you are talking about is a cakewalk, even when an economic system collapses, because the wise know that everything goes in cycles. (Especially economies.)
