I agree. People complain too much about MtGox. They allowed $266!

My greatest worry is that all this ASIC mining is going to result in Bitcoin having a ridiculous amount of centralised and specialised hardware supporting it. Big chunks of the network will be controlled by a few, and energy costs will sky-rocket to the point of being stupid. Any ideas on this?

Yeahy, sell me 1 BTC for 2.5BTC. Silver is worth $19. Should be more like 1.5BTC for one coin, no? Max 2 BTC. Just my 2 satoshis.
