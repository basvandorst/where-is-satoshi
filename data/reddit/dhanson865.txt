you have to submit it at the change of the hour. If you do it too soon it is full from the prior hour, if you do it to late 100 people beat you that hour.
Just like calling in a radio station. You have to be one of the first 100 each hour on the hour.
Check  or similar to make sure your time is right to within a second or two and then watch for the hour to come up and try again.
btw if I did the math right that is a 1485 byte transaction, massive.

That's not an option for a lot of low fee transactions now that BTC is up around $10,000.
ViaBTC won't let you accelerate a TX with a fee below fee of 0.0001BTC/KB 
So at $10,000 per BTC a fee below 40 per byte on a 250 byte transaction would keep you from using the ViaBTC transaction accelerator. Similar for a fee below 20 per byte on a 500 byte transaction.
the only way u/absurdparadox 's TX would be valid for that service at 13.7 per is if the TX size was 730 bytes or larger.
Still it's worth a trip to  just to see. If the fee is over 0.0001 then it's easy enough to wait for the end of an hour and submit it.

Enough that it's worth selling, and thus I've found out how inconvenient it is to turn it into USD. The fact that it is hard to spend saved me from cashing half of it out back when it was in the $2,000 to $2,500 range.
By the time I got my act together and started doing something with it, the price had gone well past $3,000. I still have about 80% of what I mined. I'm still spending what I can directly and looking to turn small chunks to USD as I go. Every transaction ends up being smaller than the one before (smaller in BTC for the same amount of USD I pull out).
Hopefully it keeps going up. I'll hold a bit in reserve in case it just never stops going up in value. No idea what would make me sell the reserve portion. I suppose if the reserve got too high in value I'd reduce the amount of BTC in the reserve in that same way (smaller chunks of BTC to get a fixed size chunk of USD).

If the transaction was 168 bytes then you didn't pay 13.7 per, you paid 121 per or you are confused about the significance of the 0.00020357142857142858 you posted.

You said


now you say 


which is 2.03 per byte
How can I know what your transaction is or what fees were paid if you don't say the same numbers in multiple posts? Maybe give me a transaction ID?
As is I don't know if you even know what the real numbers are.

Decent advice if he had paid 13.7 per. But now after asking for details he changed his story to 2.03 per.
He also says it confirmed without using an accelerator.

Someone on another forum asked "How Big a solar system to get?".
My reply minus the extraneous comments was:


So I have to ask why your numbers for astronomical distances are so small. Seems like you are not using the full measurement from the sun to those objects.

back in 2011 it was, download this program, install it, leave it running. Harder than just clicking a button on a web page but you could still literally do it and be clueless. It did mostly nothing most of the time, every once in a while it'd add a number to your total like +0.13120128 BTC.
Basically I left my PC on 24/7 for a few months. If I was gaming I turned off the mining app. If I wasn't gaming I let it run (while I was asleep or at work). At the end of those months I had maybe $50 worth of bitcoin and probably spent $30 on electricity.
The PC I used was a single or dual core Athlon with a fanless video card. Nothing monstrous. Not even strong enough to play the top grade first person shooters at 1024x768.
I did it and then ignored it for 6 years or so. Never realized what it would become. $50 in 2011 turns into thousands of dollars today.

It's conceptually a mix between creating it and assigning it to you. No one has it before you mine it so I wouldn't say it can be transferred from nothing to you.
Mathematically they created an equation that has large numbers as answers, only some of those large numbers are valid answers to the equation. Mining is the process of testing each large number to see if it is a valid answer. When you find a valid answer (if you are the first to find it) there is a bounty for finding it and it is paid in bitcoin assigned to the miner or group of miners that submitted the valid answer. The mining app then transmits that record out to the blockchain so that everyone knows that answer is taken and they exclude it from further testing. Occasionally more than one minor will find the same answer within a small time period and the chain picks one and builds from there leaving the other as the unlucky one.
Why it takes computing power is because if it didn't one person would have all the bitcoins as soon as he created it. Making it take effort distributes the wealth to those that do the work. Making it take more effort over time keeps it from being infinite which would cause inflation and make the coins worthless.


fwiw there are currently about 16,663,737 bitcoins ($7427.86 each) with a market cap of $123,775,905,513

The price might have only trippled but the size of the patty has been reduced more than once during that time. I'm not sure the exact reduction factor to apply, just saying it isn't the same hamburger now.

I'd say that needs to change someday. I wonder if it will.

Currency exchanges aren't taxable, Income is. (and by exchange I mean if a consumer trades a few USD for CAD he doesn't get taxed for swapping fiat).
So it comes down to did you invest in bitcoin or did you just happen to have some small amount and spend it?
I've never put cash into bitcoin so I'd say I didn't invest. I ran a program and earned. They need to write a new law for taxing mining if they want to tax that but it shouldn't be taxed at capital gains rates.
And man tracking costs of the PC and electricity and using those as deductions vs the bitcoin spent is a pain to do if you aren't a professional miner. I suppose I could just use the entire cost of the PC and the entire cost of the electric bill for the months I mined but any more nuance than that would require guessing or guidance from the IRS.

$10,000 per transaction is a required form. But if you break it up into multiple transactions they may report anyway

ViaBtc accelerator is down. Are there any free accelerators that replace that need?

Puerto Rico also has poor infrastructure and gets hit by Hurricanes on a semi regular basis. Be prepared to live without government provided water and electricity (install Solar PV, Tesla Powerwalls, have a filtration system that can make potable water).
Not saying to not move there, just saying it's a different world living on an island in hurricane alley.
