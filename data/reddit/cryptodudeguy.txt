Good point on the upcoming privacy features with Litecoin. I did not really take that into consideration. It will be very interesting to see how it plays out on there. 
I don't really think there are any problems selling privacy coins as far as laws and regulations. I think it is more the fact they don't want to be tied to anything that is tied to anything illegal. 
They definitely might list Monero or Dash but my personal opinion is that it will take quite some time if they do list at all.

I don't ever see Coinbase adding Monero to their platform...I think they will want to stay away from Privacy coins.

Nothing to support my claim but just going by how careful Coinbase is following the SEC and any regulations. Monero being tied to the torrent web and the history it has with dirty money. It could bring negative publicity on them. Here is a thread that brings both sides of the table to the discussion regarding this.

It's a start though... If CB adds more coins to their platform then it will be a decent diversified index. Yes, not much to it right now but an easy way for new money to hold crypto long term.

It's not overwhelmingly bullish news but in the long run, it's definitely bullish news for Bitcoin. Sometimes when markets are red no matter the magnitude of the news, it is not going to change that. Long-term though if it helps ETFs pass and another on-ramp into crypto why would that not be a very good thing?
