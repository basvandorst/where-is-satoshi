Come back to coinmarketcap.com in a month pal, and see how fucking "right" you were then.

blockstream is just a company that was created by bitcoin developers. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:32:34
bitcoin.com is used to promote Bcash, just in a slightly subtle manner.

In the cryptocurrency space, we are our own banks. This is both good and bad. This means that the average idiot actually needs to educate themselves on how to stay safe, and sadly most won't. If you fail to take precautions, if you fail to educate yourself, you share a part of the blame. As simple as that. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:12:30
you miss the point. Bitcoin Cash needs to have bitcoincash.com as a domain name, not Bitcoin.

This is stupid. 99% of us are not here to use bitcoin as a currency. We're here to make money, so the only thing we really care about are the things that can increase the value of bitcoin, which would be an ETF.

Why do they look like cardboard cutouts? Especially the guy on the right.

No. It's paying 22K for info before the general public gets it.

More realistically: "what the fuck is a Bitcoin?" Your bill is 870,000 &lt;insert some fixed-price shamcoin made by a shady ass greedy bastards here&gt;. Simply confirm the transaction with this quick anal probe...

I think that we have seriously different understanding of what "scaling" means. Bitcoin is by far inferior to just about every single other serious project that exist. Ethereum, Iota, Neo, Waves, anything using PoS... the list could go on.  
Think of Bitcoin is a tunnel. When only a few cars want to go through, it works great. When a few hundred try going through, it gets back up and traffic (transactions) are delayed. Other projects, such as IOTA, don't use a tunnel at all though. Each person has their own tunnel created, and when they go through they're responsible for supporting two other tunnels. 
Bitcoin has trouble scaling because you can only expand a single tunnel to be so wide. I really don't understand how you could ever make the statement that Bitcoin is years ahead of anything... it's years behind. The dev team works at a fucking snails pace and doesn't share the original vision of Bitcoin. 
I can send money from one adress to another instantly with PIVX. I can use and host DAPPS with Ethereum. I have faster blocktimes with Litecoin, which only has a single developer. I can earn transaction fees with NEO. I can send money without any fees with IOTA. Or I can pay $4 in transaction fees to buy a $1 coffee with Bitcoin. There are literally blockchains being developed that can support hundreds of thousands of transactions per second while Bitcoin handles a whopping 3, last time I checked. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 11:01:12
Listen, Bitcoin doesn't give a fuck about you. It's a technology. It was fantastic, and it kicked this whole blockchain race off, but you have to have an objective look at this. It's already outdated technology compared to many others. 
"they never had to scale" - what are you even talking about? Bitcoin hasn't "had to scale", and other currencies are already much more progressive about this issue. There are blockchains being developed that can support hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. From your comment, I really think that you lack the technical understanding of the hundreds, if not thousands, of technical improvements that other blockchains have made. Not to mention the fact that they aren't tied down by absolutely ridiculous politics and developers that don't seem to actually believe in the project at all. Bitcoin is still using PoW ffs.

No. Learn to do math, and ignore absolute fucking dumbasses like this. At Bitcoin's current supply of 16,527,237 coins, it would take marketcap of 16,527,237,000,000 for Bitcoin to be worth 1 million. - That's.... I don't even know what number that is. 16 trillion? 16 trillion is a shitload of money, and there are thousands of cryptocurrencies and thousands more will be made in the future. BTC is already quite outdated compared to others such as IOTA, which has no transaction fee. Bitcoin is only going up because it's the first, but once it's surpassed, by Ethereum or something else, the rate of growth will slow dramatically until it starts to fall - quite possibly permanently. 
If, at any point in the future Bitcoin does obtain a marketcap of 16 trillion, a loaf of bread will be 30 trillion.

I'm not talking about the FOMO ones, I'm talking about the "The flippening" and "BTC ship is sinking" crowds in the bcash subreddit.

I don't think that big blockers really understand that we're looking for a radically different approach to scaling, that makes a bigger block size irrelevant. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:38:27
and then the precedent will be set, and something else will come along and kill Bitcoin Cash. Additionally this entire fucking thing will ensure that other devs trademark their shit from now on, and future tech won't be forkable, like IOTA. 
The fuckwits supporting Bitcoin Cash just think "Cheap Bitcoins!, Maybe this will replace Bitcoin and I can buy them at $1K and sail all the way up to $100K!". This isn't happening now. This whole damn thing is turning into a joke to outsiders.

Yes. Saying this is someone that is trying to earn enough money in all of this to go to a coding bootcamp while also taking as many free online coding courses as possible.

2x is not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is and will always be the ORIGINAL CHAIN. You don't get to just create some bullshit fork and then try to declare it as the original chain. 
2mb block size is not needed right now, and research is being done on ACTUAL tech improvements. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:44:21
BTC is being spammed with low fee transactions. It works perfectly fine on a normal day. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:48:25
No...it won't. Something will knock BTC out of the  spot, probably this year, and it will probably be Ethereum. Then it's down to    ect... the only thing going for it is that it's  That's t.

You mean like that one coin where the anonymous inventor pre-mined 1 million coins? What was that called again? It starts with a B I think. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:27:45
Doesn't mean shit. 97-99% of everyone in this space doesn't use that information. They think "research" is watching Youtube videos.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:15:22
Nah, pretty sure it's N..... and an i follows the B.... Bi...n.

Is no one around here capable of doing math? Please, for the love of god, multiply Bitcoin's supply by the price point that you think it can hit. In order for it to hit $1 Million, it would need a marketcap of 16 trillion. 16 trillion is reasonable to expect in 5-10 years for the entire Cryptomarket, but not Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is plagued by ridiculous fucking politics and developers who don't share Satoshi's vision holding it back. Othere rivals are popping up all the time that are offering better security, privacy, and better user UIs. 
Cryptocurrency will never reach mass adoption until we get rid of addresses as they are now, and replace them with actual names tied to real identities. 
Will it reach 10K? Sure, but pull your heads out of your asses. Other options are surpassing Bitcoin. The only advantage that Bitcoin has now is that it was first, and once something else passes it Bitcoin will never regain the lead. 
The value of these coins are based on their usability. Other options exist already that offer cheaper, faster, and private transactions. Some currencies are already doing away with the addresses, and replacing them with usernames. Options exist that allow for voting and governence, and provide the developers with a constant source of income. Bitcoin's developers have been fucking bought and they are owned. They are no longer acting in Bitcoin's best interest.

People, stop being gullible fucking sheep. Coinbase isn't a trusted name. Money isn't going to suddenly flow into Crypto because some no name startup launched a custody service. Institutional investors are going to stick with the names that they're familiar with. If a company like Fidelity opened a custody fund, that would be a different matter.

It already passed 2300 last night. It went back to down.
