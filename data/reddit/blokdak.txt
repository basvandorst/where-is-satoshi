Yeah, it is a fancy term for printing. And it saved the fucking global economy. Europe held off a couple years longer with their own QE program and their recovery is still ongoing while ours has been complete for a long time.
Printing is just a tool of monetary policy. Your dollars don't have any value one way or the other. The strength and confidence that the US economy will continue in strength is what makes your dollars look like they're worth something.

"rational system"? All economies are built on the decision of individuals which are far from rational.
Negative interest makes perfect sense from a macro standpoint. You just don't want to admit that macroeconomics exist. You're probably one of those people who think that running a national or global economy is like balancing the family checkbook.
Back to negative interest: it should cost you something to preserve the value of massive assets that you aren't using to help the economy grow. Hoarding should be penalized. Why should you be guaranteed a bottom floor to the cost of not contributing to the economy by lending your wealth in active ways that get you better than negative returns?
They make perfect sense. It's irrational that we don't use them. It's only fair actually. Why is "zero" some magic number below which interest rates Shall Not Pass? That's totally arbitrary in favor of the bankers and capital holders.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:43:10
It primarily goes up or down based on the strength of the US economy. In other words, how likely is it that these 20 year treasuries and private loans denominated in dollars will not lose significant value when they're paid off. This is also relative to other investment vehicles in other countries, including their currencies.
The ability to print money and devalue one's currency slightly is often a really good and powerful thing you can do with fiat currency because the weaker your own currency is vs others, the easier it is to export.
Additionally, and this is more complicated than current economic theory understands or allows for, when you make more money available for lending (i.e. print money) at lower rates then you stimulate growth in your economy. This is why the great recession didn't become the great depression.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:22:00
You lend at zero or negative interest because you lose less money doing so than you would by holding onto it in the form of an inflationary currency. This is a good thing because, in general and overall debt is a good thing.
Being able to borrow is a leveling factor. You talk about just being able to hold onto your currency until you have enough to buy what you need, but there are two assumptions in that: one, that you have any currency to spare (it's not always possible to save, especially because a deflationary economy puts downward pressure on wages) and two, that the chance to take advantage of an opportunity that requires capital is not time-dependent.
Let's say you have a great idea for a business or an invention that nobody else has yet, but you don't have enough capital to get that going. By the time you save enough cash to get it started, the market has moved on either because another company has figured out your angle or the time just isn't right anymore.
Put it another way, let's say you have a small business already and one of your customers wants you to provide an additional product or service which would be within your scope and capabilities, but would take a large amount of capital to get off the ground. A new manufacturing facility, for instance. You are best suited in the market to provide this customer's needs all but for your lack of capital. Because you don't have the cash to build that new facility, they go elsewhere and are provided poorer service at probably a higher price.
The only advantage your competitor had over you was capital. Everybody loses when capital is a complete barrier to entry.
Debt and loans shouldn't go away, because they allow more efficient allocation of resources. Even when bets (loans) don't pay off (default), that money usually at least goes back into the economy instead of just sitting in a bank account.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:07:28
Uh, or they tax it. Or they borrow more at lower rates to pay it.
We don't create money to pay debts, at least not in any large part. Monetary policy ("printing money") is used to control inflation and deflation and encourage employment by making lending easier. You don't get shit without a strong lending market.

That's an incredibly short-sighted view. If the economy collapses because of a lending crunch then the value of the dollar plummets for decades. If the money supply is increased to prop up or stimulate lending through a crisis then the minor effects of inflation are easily earned back by growth in the economy and confidence in the dollar globally.
Trust that US economists and government can weather crises is what makes the dollar strong, like any investment tool. There's no inherent value in a dollar. Just like there's no inherent value in gold. Or Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-02 07:58:34
The flaw in your reasoning is that dividing the wealth of currency holders doesn't decrease the value of their wealth, so neither does it increase the amount available for lending.
I think one of the main things that is missed by the Bitcoin community at large is that anybody who holds wealth owes their success to the society which made their wealth possible. It could not have been achieved in the absence of that society. This implies an obligation on the part of the wealth-holder which goes largely unacknowledged. I know this seems tangential to your response, but if you think about it long enough, I think you'll see it's not so far removed.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:54:54
Most of the economic power vested in individuals nowadays in the US comes via debt. This isn't inherently bad, but imagine what would happen if all of those debts became harder and harder to pay off because their value kept increasing but your wages didn't. Actually your wages go down because the individual dollars can buy more. But your debt doesn't go down because interest rates aren't allowed to go negative.
So deflation is great for the lenders until it causes everybody to default, and then everybody is fucked.
That's one reason. There are others.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:58:52
Unless it stimulates the economy and increases investment in the country. That causes the value of the dollar to rise.
Besides, a strong dollar by itself is bad for the economy because it makes our exports more expensive.

@_date: 2017-12-02 17:43:43
That's an interesting perspective: that the economy (i.e. the myriad decisions made by individuals each second as to how resources, wealth, and risk are allocated between them) should have to adapt to the properties of a currency rather than the other way around. I view currencies as a means to an end and not an investment vehicle by themselves. All forex trading is inherently speculative, and Bitcoin as a currency falls into that same category. Currencies are a tool and the more flexibility we have over how that tool helps serve us, the better. Bitcoin is too inflexible, in my opinion, to ever be useful as an everyday currency in a world of many dynamic economies.

When they say "printing money" they mean that the Fed increases the balances available for lending at banks. It's done with a computer. They basically just give the banks money to lend by changing the value in their account.

@_date: 2018-09-09 00:36:17
What the ever loving fuck are you talking about? The US itself tries this dumbass idea every couple decades and it leads to massive hoarding by the rich. Not investment. New investment comes when you make more people wealthy enough to invest by paying them more. Historically this means taxing the shit out if the rich and then having the government pay people reasonable wages to build things that everybody needs and wants. Like, I don't know, infrastructure?
We don't need to wait around for another great depression to fix things again. Tax the rich until they're only pretty well off.

Like with any market, there are people who want to sell and those who want to buy. When there are more available for sale, then the buyer can select a lower price because there isn't any one "official" price. When there are fewer available to sell but stronger demand to buy, the sellers can ask for a higher price.
Sometimes that becomes a feedback loop. It can happen in both directions. Seems like it might be happening now.

It's not an assumption, it's a conclusion drawn from observations made throughout history. A good one is the great depression.
Those with money to invest and lend became spooked by any one of a number of economic events that indicated (as would happen often in the future) the frailty of a capitalist economy left unchecked by a lack of regulation. They became scared of losing more money, so they hodled their dollars and gold. Result: it became nearly impossible to borrow money, so the cost (price) of dollars went up. Deflation. Soon nobody could borrow because interest rates soared, so paychecks went unpaid, businesses stagnated, growth went negative, and bam. Deflation killed the economy of the world. Well, it was the implement anyway.
Contrast that with how we got *out* of the great depression: massive spending and lending by the government made dollars easier to get, so people could afford to borrow to buy inventory, or invest in their businesses or make payroll when a client was late paying their bills. Debt and lending is the bread and butter of a healthy economy, and that's exactly what goes missing when everybody hodls. Deflation results.
More recently, the great recession in the US was largely mitigated by the creation of like $800billion worth of new money (debt incurred by the government) and given to private banks for the purposes of lending. Now, for many reasons (credit rating agencies being up there), that was nowhere near as effective as direct government investment had been. But if you contrast it with the European reaction (austerity - i.e., keep hodling), the US recovered much more quickly. In fact, it wasn't until the ECB initiated its own QE program that Europe began to come out of stagnation more generally.
It's just history.
Edit: this is why the Fed and monetary policy can be a great tool. By manipulating the base rate at which banks lend to each other you can increase and decrease the cost of money without incurring debt. Most Fed-haters don't seem to know that the Fed has a DUAL MANDATE: Control inflation/deflation (stability) *AND* ensure full employment. The Fed comes from a time where people actually cared about creating and keeping jobs by empowering the government and the workers through Labor protection laws. You know, those evil unions. Nowadays it's all about making sure the employer gets his first. Gets alllll his first.

Edit: okay, I didn't read your last sentence... Booms and busts might be influenced by monetary policy, but it is much more heavily influenced by fiscal policy. The cycle is stark: economy grows so regulation relaxes, boom becomes bubble, then everybody realizes the emperor has no clothes. Laissez-faire fails again. So during the bust tax and fiscal policy eventually adjusts to redistribute unused wealth to the benefit of the country. And things start going well again. After a few years everything is great and nobody seems to remember that the last time we took the brakes off of what essentially limitless capital could do it didn't turn out so well. Monetary policy helps temper the extremes, but the cycle is a historical one in the sense that nobody ever learns from history.

I know the logic that seems to support this hypothesis, but what kind of evidence is there that adoption reduces volatility of a currency, especially when there are multiple currencies to choose from, including established fiat-based ones (which are stabilized in many ways)?
If bitcoin is really something new then there isn't a precedent for knowing how it will work, so you can't male predictions about it since the world has never seen its like before.
If you have evidence of the adoption/stability relationship as applied to cryptocurrencies I'd be very interested to see it.

There is wealth created in the interim that isn't lost. Making debt available to purchase failed assets during the downturn caused by a speculative bubble burst means those assets are available again for creating wealth. The problem at a macro level that printing solves is when money (cash+debt) isn't available to those best suited to capitalize on those assets, so they just sit there, unable to be used or are scrapped. Making debt available to those who can use assets (companies, equipment, real-estate, projects/contracts, patents - all of it) more effectively (because of their expertise or position in their market or whatever) than simply scrapping them enables wealth creation even during a downturn. This is market-based meritocracy at its finest.
Of course there are other benefits to avoiding a lending crisis, and I'm sure you know them.
Another point is that the full faith and credit of the US government isn't going anywhere just because they buy more debt. If this is indeed a case of American exceptionalism, at least in this point in history, then using other countries' hyperinflation isn't really useful as an example. I can't think of a single country positioned like the US is now that collapsed due to printing money. That doesn't mean it can't happen, it just means there's no evidence yet. But the world did get taken down (and kept there) by Austrian economic thinking (loosely grouped as "austerity" today) during the great depression, and it wasn't until FDR's massive wealth redistribution efforts, including printing money, that things changed for the better.
Edit: added comment about meritocracy.

But she repeated them! And OP made a poorly written post repeating them evem again. OP's family has done twice the damage by now.

Well I'll take all that worthless fiat off your hands then and turn it into cars, food, shelter, and Netflix.
