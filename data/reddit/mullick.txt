I thought you were saying it in the sense of you are not in control of the keys. So you are correct. I misunderstood the context
@_date: 2015-12-28 08:54:57
Mycelium does generate keys locally. Although it is not a full node. If you are running mycelium you are just using core with an extra middleman.

Im not sure some of this is accurate. If you had called the office if should have been forwarded to me. And I can assure you we dont "yell accross the office" or insult customers. If you have a ticket number we would be more than happy to help. I cant think of any user off the top of my head that has any pending DRK withdrawals we are holding. Please respond with the ticket number and any more info you have and we would be happy to assist you
@_date: 2014-08-13 19:57:29
Glad to hear everything is going well :)
@_date: 2014-08-16 03:55:01
Yes this was an issue we discovered lately that i should have caught when posting this. When we moved to new ebservers this code push was not done correctly. Fixed now :)
@_date: 2014-08-13 20:37:41
We have responded to your ticket. Our API expert was out of town from last tuesday until today. We only have one call that comes to mind and that customer was told the message would be given to Paul when he returned from his business trip. Which was today. I dont see any outstanding issues on your account and all recent withdrawals have gone through. If you are having any further issues our API expert would be more than happy to assist you in the ticket you filed
@_date: 2014-08-20 08:15:34
We have no minimum balance required. The minimum withdrawal amount is .001
@_date: 2014-08-15 01:25:46
We do not allow http access which is likely why downforeveryoneorjustme.com was reporting it was down. We did have some momentary drop of connections but shouldnt have affected very many users. We do apologize that you were unable to access the site
@_date: 2014-08-13 21:00:49
Yes it is very likely we were confused with another call. We brainstormed about what call that could have been and thats all we could come up with. As we havent taken any other messages recently and dont get all that many calls for technical support. I agree we could do a better job at informing users when the technical support rep they are waiting for will not be available. I do urge users to follow up with any issues via freshdesk. Our support ticket system. If we carry out support in multiple places it tends to create more confusion and things don't get documented as well. Glad to hear your issue is getting sorted out. :)
@_date: 2014-08-18 02:28:56
I gotta admit. I laughed at this one.
@_date: 2014-08-13 20:38:55
Im not sure who that was directed at. This is the first report of any DRK api withdrawal issues we have seen. We will investigate. Thank you
@_date: 2015-05-02 19:46:06
I thought you were done with the tips. Now I have to find someone to pass this along to :)

The more nodes running that will validate and rebroadcast blocks and transactions the more secure a confirmation is in a lot of ways. So really he wasn't wrong saying that it helped confirmations. It does. Just not their speed.
@_date: 2015-05-03 01:35:11
Why? A bit of a over reaction
@_date: 2015-05-02 06:28:57
I have nothing but respect for what you are doing. Things like this can not be tolerated in the community. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 01:33:28
We have customer support and technical support. Our agent got confused by the change of topic from 2fa to transaction signing. As we have never had address validation as a option for resetting 2fA. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:41:27
Perhaps I will write up a tutorial on how to do so on a cheap $5 a month server. Ill link here when complete
@_date: 2015-05-03 11:22:14
Mintsy is in no way like GAW.
You can verify your hashrate. It can be pointed at any pool under your worker.
You can also split it among multiple coins/pools

I am at the conference and he showed up about a half an hour ago. Standing by the booth with the rest of his team fielding questions
@_date: 2015-01-25 09:52:01
Ha I know the feeling. Haven't had that happen in a while until this week :)
@_date: 2015-05-03 04:47:19
We have no relationship with garza if thats what you mean. Also you cannot mine paycoin so there is that. You can stake/mint. But we are not doing that at this time due to the negative feedback. The coinfire article has been addressed.  
@_date: 2015-05-03 03:46:22
I have been with Cryptsy since beta and worked for them for 2+ years so yes. I am. What in particular are you referencing?
@_date: 2015-05-03 01:25:56
Our support agent didnt understand your initial inquiry. If you had explained it to her she would have forwarded the ticket to me.
That being said. We cannot reset your 2fa just by signing a message from the origin of your deposit. If you email me at mullick Ill see what we can work out for you. 
I felt like this deserves a more in depth explanation.
Most of our support tickets are for simple issues. Like password resets. Resetting 2fa etc. For this reason we have 2 divisions of our support.
Customer support. And technical support. In this case once you explained what you wanted your ticket would have been escalated to technical support which would know exactly what you mean as its something we use fairly often.
@_date: 2015-05-03 01:38:40
Our technical support uses message signing fairly often. Our Customer service agent was confused by the question is all
@_date: 2015-05-03 03:48:47
" It does not create more confirmations (either at the same or an accelerated rate)."
I did not claim that in any way. I stated that the more nodes that are there validating and rebroadcasting the blocks the more secure a single confirmation can be. It helps reduce orphans and the chances of network segregation.
I did edit my last post now to reflect broadcasting as well as validating
@_date: 2015-08-22 08:41:17
It looks like Horus is assisting you with this issue. Hopefully you guys can get it figured out. Let me know if there is anything else you need
@_date: 2015-08-21 21:53:56
I got an email about this today. Although google alerted me the link in the ticket contained malware.
We wont ask for your ID unless you were unable to answer your security questions. Do you have a ticket number or anything? i have no way of looking into your account if you dont
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:57:11
Noticed a few format changes. Such as listunspent being changed from
"amount" : 1.0000000
"amount": 1.0000000
I like the steps taken in this release to limit the mempool as well. Great job devs
@_date: 2015-07-07 00:53:16
Why don't you go troll an actual scam instead of a company trying to continue providing the safest environment to trade your alt coins
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:25:18
This provides us with some very valuable insight. I want to thank whoever released this. It will help us harden our security as we can learn form others unfortunate incidents. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 23:06:00
Your withdrawal was likely cancelled due to a rocky transition to cryptsy.ca Cryptsy.ca will be handling all CAD transactions going forward and will be open in a few days. With better deposit and withdrawal methods. Vogogo being included in that.
You will not need to verify again as your account will carry over. We apologize for the delays. But cryptsy.ca will allow us to provide better options for transferring CAD
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:56:05
I agree
@_date: 2015-07-11 23:00:31
We will never ask for your password. If someone asked you for that it was not our support.
@_date: 2015-07-06 16:01:52
We have never done anything of the sort. Google is your friend. But you have to read past the headline.....
@_date: 2015-07-06 16:01:03
We have never done anything of the sort.
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:48:37
I did. And responded below....
@_date: 2015-07-10 23:26:26
Its policy that we cannot respond to any messages that did not come from the email on file. Which is why you should not use an alias when registering with a financial business. 
We dont use email as a fool proof verification. But if the ticket comes from an email not registered on the account then we cannot respond to that email. We have options for sending your security questions encrypted and im sure your ticket will be updated shortly to reflect that.
@_date: 2015-07-15 02:24:12
Shouldnt have said limit the mempool. But the control it gives over what you accept to the mempool such as the minrelayfee and limitfreerelay which reading the release notes it seems may not be new to this release. My bad
@_date: 2015-09-21 01:44:32
Can you name one? We have never taken funds from our users. If they lost money due to en error on our part we would like to know about it so we can correct it.
@_date: 2015-09-22 02:04:05
You linked to 2 people who dont like cryptsy. But didnt state an issue with us. And one where the account was accidentally locked due to inactivity when the apikey was still in use which has been fixed.
People like to hate us. But never have proof we "steal coins" from our users when asked. Because we do not.
@_date: 2015-09-22 20:32:25
Are you referring to the payouts? I think they are done weekly or monthly.
@_date: 2015-09-21 01:46:51
Our withdrawal fees paid to the network are calculated by bitcoin core. Although during some of the recent stress tests i raised the fee per kb to prevent delayed withdrawals.
Our withdrawal fee charged to the user is calculated by the average fee paid over the last 1000 send transactions from the wallet.
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:06:45
This can all be done with bitcoin core. This is a bit outdated now but still is the same process
@_date: 2015-03-19 11:39:22
Awesome. Thanks! Finally got me to sign up for changetip :)
@_date: 2015-10-20 06:16:59
I really have no idea who it would be. 
The paycoin prime controller controversy was a mess. We believed the paycoin foundation was trying to clean up the mess left by garza. We thought it would help those who lost from the scam by taking a prime controller that was paying garza and company and making it pay them. He was never involved in the process. We contacted the foundation after we heard they were planning to take over without garza's consent. The community was right. We couldnt ensure we wouldnt put any more money into garza's pockets while trying to help the victims. So the idea was canned and if I could light the prime controller on fire I would.
The change from Trade fees to Withdrawal fees was a move to increase liquidity and encourage more trades.  Which is what every trader wants to see in an exchange. Some chinese exchanges have used this model with success. It was an abrupt switch, but free withdrawals were given to users who had an outstanding balance at the time of the switch. 
The malleability attack did cause us some issues when it first started. When we would move larger inputs to the withdrawal wallet it would create long chains of transactions. Each spending the previous txes unconfirmed change. If one of these txes was mutated the rest of the chain would be invalidated and need to be manually removed from the database. We no longer spend unconfirmed change and send multiple smaller inputs to the withdrawal wallet. 
I would have no problem believing the coinfire article. Even though I know the accusations are false, I could see a government agency wanting to verify they are not true. But the article doesnt just try to inform the reader we are being investigated it tries to paint us as "One of the worst offenders". And nowhere provides any real proof. Which to me seems more like an attack on our character than an informative article. Cryptsy is like a small family and I know everyone very well. None of us would ever do anything like the accusations in that article. 
I do not believe the coinfire article to be true. If it is and these government agencies believe these accusations we would love to open our books to them to show them they are not. But the facts are, we have invested a lot of time and money into a strong compliance team. We have never been contacted by any government agency about any of our actions. We try to go above and beyond any regulators expectations of us.
@_date: 2015-10-20 09:18:26
We were never involved with Homero.
Why do you keep posting angry messages and deleting them?
If your account was locked due to inactivity all you need to do is contact support. Posting that you hope I die on reddit wont help you any
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:41:24
I personally run about 7 full nodes. 3 Of which have no other purpose. For your average joe it does consume quite a bit of resources for the initial sync. Once synced its really not that bad though
@_date: 2015-10-20 03:02:40
We do not have multiple core devs in florida. Most are remote so would not be applying for Jobs in the area. As far as development there are 3 employees in Florida. Myself, Paul and our VP of development. I havent applied for any other jobs. And I doubt our CEO would.
At best maybe one employee interviewed somewhere else and you exaggerated the story.
More than likely you are full of shit and none of it ever happened.
This whole smear campaign is really getting out of hand. Whoever is behind it is spending a lot of time trying to ruin our reputation. Which wasnt the greatest in the first place due to past troubles we have had.
@_date: 2015-03-25 21:23:49
The cold storage would be pointless if we showed a balance. If someone breaks into your account they will see a zero balance and move on. If they saw they were in cold storage they would attempt to recover them. When the rightful owner signs into the account they can file a ticket and have the balances restored. We also do not send out an email as in most cases the attacker would also have access to your email. Perhaps the system needs fine tuning. But we will always restore the balances to the rightful owner and it has saved many of users from financial loss.
EDIT: We tossed some ideas around the office on ways to improve the system. We will be making some changes to it in the coming days/weeks 
@_date: 2015-03-20 23:52:30
With the latest release the sync process has been shortened drastically. The development team did a great job. Now it downloads all block headers first. So it knows of all blocks. Then can download the remaining blocks asynchronously
@_date: 2015-02-04 08:56:10
The issue was resolved nearly 12 hours ago. The verification was due to the user being unable to answer the security questions as he documented in the thread.
@_date: 2015-02-04 01:42:32
The funds were released. Who knows if he will be back to verify we did or not

I wasnt implying that coinbase was hacked. But rather the user. And it wasnt really hacked but just tricked.
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:14:45

We keep 85% of all funds in cold storage. The inactive accounts cold storage and our main cold storage are completely seperate.

Have any ticket  People dont usually let $1000 go. If you have a ticket # I will see why you never got a response and get your coins back to you
@_date: 2015-02-03 22:19:09
Your comparison doenst fit. The user from coinbase was hacked. The user from cryptsy was unable to verify his account. 2 separate things. The user would have the same trouble with coinbase

We did not steal your coins. Accounts with no login activity have their funds moved to cold storage. A simple support ticket will return them to your account. This is done to protect your funds
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:07:04
It is done so if an attacker were to gain access to you account it would appear to be empty. Say the attacker had everything they need to get into your account. Username, Password, access to email, answers to your security questions. If they see a 0 balance they move on. If they see a balance but are unable to move it they would contact us, Provide all the necessary info and we would be powerless to stop it.

Hello, I'm a Chat moderator at Cryptsy. Just file a support ticket and Vern can work something out. I have seen others with similar issues in the past. Got cleared up pretty quickly
