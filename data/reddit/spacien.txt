Bitcoin needs to reach the milestone of atleast USD1 per satoshi one as store of value to make even a small dent in the controlling grip of  hidden masters of global bankers through their Fractional Reserve Banking , precious metals, real estate,commodity , FX , Libor rates  , bond and hidden derivates markets.  All these blessed by respective country reserve banks armed with country /regional /global legislations which has been lobbied, drafted and vetted by the same controllers with their well funded conforming politicans. Time to use bitcoin to move us in this game of chess, from being pawns to kings and queens,  controlling our own destiny as we evolve from homo sapiens into  homo spaciens making  galaxies our playground. 
Having decades of exposure to one of the worlds largest bank, and having seen trillions of dollars in minor accounts,  I can state with some confidence, there are billions of USD equivalent for every individual on the planet, expanding expontentially every minute under fractional reserve banking ), but fake theory of prymid structure of wealth greed model (conning us to climb imaginery wealth ladders, ) , keeping us  unnessarily busy and occupied where kids suffer as both parents having to work, while remaining  destitute in actual assets at end of retirement. We are comforted by small retirement handouts from first world governments and take further solice from the  fact that we are better off than so many other people in war torn or poverity stricken countries which we have engineered, as they have not complied with our mandate of democracy founded on fiat to pillage their resources.
Bitcoin and other crypto's can be squat like flies at any time by these colossal fiat  wielding masters. Certainty is their enemy and uncertainity is their friend. Bitcoin needs to remain steadfast to gain store of value traction with community, and accept it cannot act as low value transfers of funds, and allow other fiat like token crypto's such as ether , stellar , and bankers ripple etc to do this low value work. Time bitcoin put the crown on its head as blockchain inventor and start behaving like reserve royal currency to other crypto's and only do few high value transactions per minute to provide continuous unchanging non inflationary structural certainity, driving the silver stake in the heart of the fiat vampier like masters that gorge on our energy time units.

Absolutely agree, principle based approach based on decentralized fairness will always survive and smash individual greed in the long run  , because we are social  beings naturally programmed  for collective survival, and non inflationary digital currency such as bitcoin , has finally shown the path to a more honest, transparent and fairer store of value system. My kids are sold on it, as it makes common sense to them, so future looks bright.
