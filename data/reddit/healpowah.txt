That's perfectly fine. Just make sure you have the seed words written down somewhere as a backup.

By storing your coins in an Electrum wallet and writing down your seed (as backup) you're okay. From the seed, Electrum can calculate everything needed to access your coins, including the private keys you just exported as a CSV.
You do not really need that CSV. In fact, I would argue, you should probably securely delete it "from existence". Just make sure you have the seed written down.


By this, OP (and others) effectively means that you should not put any trust to a third party such as Coinbase or Mt. Gox, rather be the sole custodian of your money (=btc). Saying "private keys" is just the "old", low level way of saying this, as in the end, you need private keys to be able to spend (but these can be calculated from the seed words).

You could instead flip a coin four times for every hex digit. :D

So how does this work exactly? Fair enough, they don't allow Alice to exchange her pot for Bob's bitcoin.
What if
1. Alice gives pot to Bob for cash AND THEN
2. Alice gives cash to Bob for bitcoin?

What exactly are those anyway? Do they mean companies providing web wallets? Or the developers working on wallet software too?
So for example, does their endgame include telling the (e.g.) Electrum devs not to include such and such feature? As in,

Worry not, even the microcode of the x86 processor in your system might be backdoored. Or the hardware based entropy compromised. Or the bios/uefi firmware. Or the firmware of any of the direct memory access devices. Or your operating system. Or the NSA might be monitoring the electromagnetic emissions of your machine. /s (or maybe not?) 
Clearly, it's worth defending against what you can, and the best way in this case would be reproducible builds (with docker images or similar). Lobby the developers. 
But then again, even that might not be enough. Problem is, that still needs trust. Who said you can trust the compiler? Not Ken Thompson, that's for sure:

Fiat money is all forms of "money" that has the same intrinsic value as monopoly money (=zero). Such as USD and EUR.

If you don't want to wait for this transaction A, you can make a new transaction B that uses this specific output (from A), with high fees. Miners will want to get paid the high fees for transaction B but they can only include it in a block if they also mine A, as B depends on A.
This is called "Child pays for parent".

If you want security, use multisig. No single wallet is more secure than that.
For example, 2 of 3 multisig with
1. phone + another phone + PC
2. phone + PC + Tails USB
3. phone + PC + hw wallet

This sounds hard to believe. I am intrigued.
If I were you, I would immediately move all my funds to a new (multisig!) wallet, just to be sure.
Perhaps you should give some more details.
1. Is your cold storage wallet a standard single cosigner Electrum wallet?
2. Where did you get the address from? ("I transferred ... from my warm to cool storage in a single transaction")
Was it from a read-only version of the wallet that you have open on your main OS?
3. While we're at it, what kind of wallet is your "warm wallet", where you sent the transaction from?

I see what you're saying and would also be interested to get someone to clarify if this is indeed the case.
Ok, I've found it in the wiki, and indeed, fees are burned and then newly generated, so they "lose" their history.

Selling bitcoins is essentially buying goods and services, without which a currency would be meaningless.
You MUST sell at some point otherwise you're just drooling over how theoretically rich you are. (as in, selling btc can mean buying a cup of coffee or a house, not necessarily green pieces of paper)

Depends on how much money you are willing to spend.
According to  the current hash rate is about 2,419,615,114 GH/s. The better quality batches of Antminer S9-s claim to have 14,000 GH/s hash rates. Last time I checked, these cost roughly 2100 USD a piece.
Now, let's make the clearly stupid assumption of the global hash rate being constant as of today. If you bought a single Antminer S9, you could roughly expect to mine a single block yourself out of every 2,419,615,114 / 14,000 = 172,830 blocks [1]. This would take 1200 days (with 10 mins per block). As this is a very long time (3.28 years), the assumption of the global difficulty being constant completely breaks down, and you would actually have a significantly longer expected time to mine a block.
If you bought 20 pieces of this gear, your relative mining performance (roughly [2]) scales linearly. Therefore, you could expect to mine a single block every 60 days.
[1] a bit worse actually, as your hash rate should be included in the global hash rate
[2] as long as you don't spend as much that would affect the global hash rate significantly

January 2016 is long after the first bubble. In fact, at that point, bitcoin had already been increasing consistently for a year.

Not trying to be extremist, but


That is basically every fiat currency (maybe excluding cash transactions). BUT THEN you could argue that if I print out pieces of paper with private keys on them, and pay with those pieces, it's the same! Hardly any difference from using USD cash. I could even print it on green paper.
They are basing the definition on the word "digital" as if that was the main difference between (e.g.) bitcoin and USD. It isn't. The main difference is control. While the US dollar is centrally controlled and only certain friends of the fed/state can be banks, bitcoin is highly decentralised and everyone can be a bank. Problem is, it's hard to incorporate this into a definition without giving away your true intention of absolute control over people's money.

Well, no way around the "legal tender" stuff... :/

"The typical U.S. fixed broadband customer enjoys about 55mbps up and 19mbps down."
