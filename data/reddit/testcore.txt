It's not "fake news" unless it was deliberately made up with the intent to deceive. That term in meaningless when idiots like you throw it around when it's just bad reporting.

The ghash website is down as well, providing a variety of 5xx errors.  But it appears the pool servers are still up.

Um, wat?  Of course they're making a profit. If a firm can generate X GH/s, and sell those hashes for more than they cost to generate, then good for them. 
I'm buying the risk of generating them.  The cost of the hashes to me is not guaranteed to be less than the value of the bitcoins generated.  That's what I'm buying - the speculation - whereas their risk lives in their power and operations costs.  Totally different gambles.

Any updates?  I'm considering one of their contracts, but am finding mixed reviews.

You do understand that the two are not mutually exclusive, no?

It's 1995 and the internet has just been opened to the public. Everyone who lived through the PC boom of the '80s knows the internet is going to be huge, but no one has any idea of what that looks like yet.

You're right, you're not an expert.  Here's what they say:

Cuz it's right next to Mental Park. Keep going and you'll be in Assholeton (I did live there for a stint), then on through Deadwood Shitty, Boringlame, and San Brunhole (home to youtube!)

1. Losing 2btc when the first silk road was raided.
2. Factory reset of phone before saving key/transferring off ~1.2 btc
3. Sending pre-fork shitcoin cash to btc address
Don't drink &amp; coin.

They're out in public. In the US at least, you have little to no expectation of privacy in public, and anyone can take your picture and post it online to make fun of.

Meh. Mostlly personal experience from living in [Shallow Alto]( at the time and it being a constant subject of discussion. We didn't have reddit yet, so we still talked in person.

This is pretty much exactly what was said 20 years ago about the internet and the WWW... which is now a flaming shithouse of data dystopia.
Hopefully bitcoin proves to be _a little_ more resilient.

Have now; thx for the link.
Though between the missing keyword search, and the outdated information, there's not too much to work with.  Would be a cool site with a few updates.

Well? Where's your 9315.24 meme?

Very cool; this answers the question exactly.  Gotta check out Nakamoto's soon...
Although, it's a little disappointing that this tech-hub sleepy-city doesn't have greater adoption.
@_date: 2015-04-27 02:10:53
Cool, thx.
Although, I keep encountering "BTM" and "one-way" in the same sentence; are BTMs not available to trade BTC for cash?  I'm looking to sell, not buy...

Netflix was [sued]( a few years back when they released "anonymised" data that was quickly de-anonymised.
