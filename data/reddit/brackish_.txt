thanks for the great answer. i think it's back to the drawing board for me because a very intelligent cryptodude named suppoman said that he won't touch btc because the price is already way too high and to chase 5x profits is for btc to be priced at $20k per coin. i'm not gonna wait for that.

are you referring to payeer? did you recently do any kyc biz with them? after they found out i was a u.s. cit/ they were literally blocking my communications. they didn't want any of my biz.

i don't think a bitcoin atm is on bkk's radar anytime soon.

as big as bkk is: no btc atm's! i've been noticing also that the phillipines is gaining more ground than siam for bitcoin business. must be because of siam's insatiable appetite for heavy regulations and uber draconian paperwork.

erm. that's what i posted: localbitcoins/payeer. payeer accepts fiat currency and can buy bitcoins. payeer customer service i think has russia locations and they spenk/ write good english- but they don't cater to u.s. clients. big duh!

yeah, that's where the problem lies: i don't wanna deal w/ the u.s. 'i need to verify you/rape you' process

i hope someday there would be a way to securely/anonymously connect to a tor server for two individuals. they do the crypto transaction, both disconnect then the tor server injects the data to its respective blockchain.

very good answers. if you did biz w/ localbitcoins.com, how satisfied were your transactions? i saw the localbitcoin prices and they were overall a bit higher than coinmarketcap prices. i guess thats the prices doing biz w/ them.

that's the by-product of an anally retentive politically-correct society.

nah, they follow the status quo. they wouldn't give a rip having your biz or not.
