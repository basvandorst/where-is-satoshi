Going up from here. 230's - 250's absolutely the bottom. Knew prices were getting ridiculous. Just in time for the Pundi x airdrop baby.

Already all in on Pundi X. Enjoying the 7.316 &amp; airdrops on Binance every month. Getting over 1 million shares a month currently. If this market ever turns around i'll be back where I was pretty quickly.

MASSIVE BULL RUN COMING!!!

I went from an initial investment of 40k to 470k in Jan back down to 60k. Fuck my life why didn't I pull out. I'm going down with the ship now, but I do feel like we're at the bottom. C'mon bitcoin!!!

Told you boys we'd bounce back today. We're at the bottom already. Everyone calling for Bitcoin to hit 5k, how often is everyone right. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:39:25
For sure, if i'm ever blessed to get back to that point. Go Pundi X! lol

Where gonna see green tomorrow morning, these prices are ridiculous. Cardano .11 cents. There's easy doubles everywhere. No way Bulls can pass this up.

What's the deal with the dildo analogy, so gay.

Get BTC 5k and sub 5k out of your heads, that WILL NEVER HAPPEN. You know how low alts would have to get? Way to many buyers. Only noobs think BTC can go that low. 250b market  is the bottom anything lower then that is ridiculous and an auto buy situation.
