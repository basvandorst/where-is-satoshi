None of them is a web wallet. They either store private keys locally or don't store it at all (i.e. they give the user exclusive access to their private key)
Some of these wallets support only ERC20 &amp; some support ERC20 + other cryptos.
I would certainly reconsider buying a hardware wallet as many people have suggested.
BTW thanks for your guidance. :)

I hope it works out for you, but reading that feels like nails on a chalkboard to me. 
I have invested around 40% of the total amount in top 20 Mcap coins. Rest are small cap which seem to have huge potential.  
A hardware wallet is a no go, but a new desktop is ok?
I can use desktop or smartphone for other purposes once I have sold the coins. This can't happen in the case of hardware wallet.
Connecting a device to the internet that hasn’t been updated for years. Right. 
Can you please elaborate what harm will it cause?

Yes, definitely hardware wallet is the most secure option available in the market. But I can get a netbook for around $150-$200 &amp; a smartphone at around $100-$150. I can use the netbook or smartphone for other purposes once I have sold the coins but this can't happen in the case of a hardware wallet.

This process was certainly time consuming &amp; quite hectic. 
BTW what is your opinion on wallets like Coinomi, Exodus, Trust, MEW &amp; Metamsk? Are they safe enough or should I reconsider having a hardware wallet?
