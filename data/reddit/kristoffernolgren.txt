Not sure how you mean? That they puhät their funds there? You could write this into a legal contract for certification this would also be a good thing for the exchanges -  they don't want to loose their funds...

@_date: 2018-01-11 23:07:04
Well, yes i think it would be way safer to send his coins to another adress that has a seed that no one but him has ever seen. 
I use a nano ledger S and have my seeds manually stamped into metal plates stored in different locations. The seed has never been put into a computer, copier or anything else digital.
The metal plates is maybe a bit overkill, but I'm pretty sure no one will throw them away by accident, that seems to be the most common reason for coins to be lost, after that, hacking of big exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:23:24
I think this is interesting, but measuring all-time-high is always bad, they are black swans and weird ouliers, better to look at weekly average or include trade-volume to figure out what people in genreal actually payed for their coins.

Look at the graph, it might not be important, and maybe even very expected in a free market, but that is literally what ut means to loose market shares
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:56:24
When building something like the lightning network, you have to assume everyone else is evil. Either on purpose or accident. If a node doesn't behave like you want it to,  you just close the channel and set a new one up. If 1000's of nodes decide too close at once, there may be some delays due to congestion on the blockchain, but this will hopefully be solved by channel factories.
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:08:35
Theory: Smaller coins will have more volatility, that means when prices go up, they go up more, when prices go down they will also go down more. 
Did you test Market cap/trade volume instead of price? It would probably be stronger indicator for this.
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:19:35

@_date: 2018-01-26 23:49:07
Here is my basic argument: People will prefer chorter routes, it will be cheaper and there is less of a risk of problem with one of the nodes. Big nodes will have a benefit here, since they will have more connections directly to your destination. This means that everybody will prefer connecting to already big nodes. Then those nodes will grow even more. This is without factors like marketing, default settings in popular wallets/exchanges etc, those can be used to even futher increase centralization. I have not seen any sufficient solutions to this problem yet.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:25:59
I'd say both.

If you do this, does it mean that bitpay still has a copy of your seed? So if they get hacked someone can take any money you have in your SamouraiWallet, even money you put in later or after you close your bitpay account?

Well if you, like me, lost what would now have been 10 million usd on mtgox, you know evrything bitcoin is about security. The reason to move bitcoin from a exchange to your own wallet is so you control the keys(if you don't control the keys you don't control the coins), but if you move them this way, there is no way of knowing if bitpay, or someone else has a copy of your keys stored somewhere, so it's true the security is not worse than on bitpay, but you are not making it better, which you definitely should or you will end up poo and bitter, like me.
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:27:08
This is how much money peope have put up in transaction fees that have not been claimed. Basically, this is transactions that are "stuck", because the fees are too high. Though some users might be fine with it and some of this might be spam aswell, that is never intended to be accepted.

@_date: 2018-01-30 10:15:13
Yes, I know this, but people said this exact more than two weeks ago. That after the last difficulty adjustment the mempool would start filling up again, since to many blocks were being mined, but instead the pool has kept emptying. If too many blocks is the driving cause of this, that indicates more and more mining is added throughout january.
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:58:11
That's not how risk rewarrd works. the risk/reward on a win/lose coinflip is the same if you bet 100 and if you bet 1 000 000. Also we are not sure that this can't be made safe enough. A nano ledger is considered safe even when it's plugged in to a computer, you could build specialized hardware that only run lightning nodes with very small risks of contamination.
You are also missing my biggest  point. If you have 1 channel and open one more you are adding very little value, because you are only connecting two nodes with one hop. But if you have 1 000 channels and open one more, you are adding connecting 1000 channels and adding a lot more value. If you have fewer connections any transaction fees must be split between all connecting nodes so you will get a lot less money.
There can also be other incentives for certain players to run big nodes, that are only valid for them. They might want to have influence over bitcoin for example.
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:19:11
Lightning is built in a way that you don't trut the other nodes, unless you are the one running the old node, you shouldn't be able to loose money. But people getting hacked/bugs causing people to loose money could cause bad PR.
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:55:42

He seems like a douche, but I don't really think that was what he(and others) have said. I still think it's a big risk of converging torwards a very centralized network and haven't seen any thing that proves the opposite.
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:12:20
I just looked at the hasrate, it's growing, but it's not growing more in january than it has before, it's rather slowing down. I think the fewer transactions is a more plausible explanation.
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:10:46
I think this is more about replacing visa/mastercard with a public service. I think it's a lot better. I don't like all swedish transaction getting funneled to a foreign government. Companies getting disabled from norms and laws from other countries etc. Decentralized is much better but this is a lesser evil and less centralized than visa/mc.
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:20:43
They said this before the last difficulty adjustment aswell, has it kept dropping? In that case, why? Lower feed = less profit = less mining?

Rember when you used to get payed to lend your money to the bank?
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:30:29
Well, my point is running a faulty node means you only risk your own funds. Bad nodes won't risk anyone elses funds. It's not recommended to run on the main net yet.
I think you are correct about time, but it's important to remember that lot's of transactions are not done by end users, if, for example exchanges could transfer all their funds over lightning, that would mean that a lot of pressure on the blockchain would be relieved. Enough to keep the regular transaction costs down, maybe.

Other scaling solutions won't be prioritized until there is congestion.A metafor might be a road with to much traffic. If you add more lanes(blocksize) traffic will get better, but more people will start taking their cars. You can add more lanes, but eventually you'll run out of land (diskspace). If you wait with the lanes, more people might start biking, going by public transport or build bigger houses closer to the city core(off chain scaling). But if the roads suck to much people might move Los Angeles(Bcash) instead. Los Angeles seems really nice right now, with their huge fast highways but in 20 years, they will have the worst traffic in the entire world.
This is not an either or type of question but a how much and when? I personally think core are a bit to conservative and a bit arrogant against competitoin and their actual users, but I also know they have  a lot more experience than I do.

This is like econ 101, but it's always presented as a non biased argument. Rich people don't keep their money in inflationary vechiles, they invest most of it. Poor people without the knowledge and access are pushed to spend as fast as possible. To me it seems nice with a bit more stagnant of an economy, maybe more people would focus on stuff that is important in life and not burn up this planet as fast as we are. At the same time it will be harder to be a capitalist – in order to earn money by owning money you have to supply goods and services that not only people desire but that are actually essential to people.

@_date: 2017-12-27 15:46:47
It takes a lot of time to invest, and especially learn it's not worth it unless you have some capital to invest. Also you have to know there is something to learn in order to learn it. Money is fraudulently created to be something fixed and static, but in reality it is much more beneficial to people with enough capital to use other stores of value. I think people with less capital would be better of in a society wittout an inflationtionary currency.

They are usually 5-10% higher than all other exchanges, I think it has to do with their fee-strucyure, but not sure.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:37:08
Fees is a big problem for commerce but even before that, commerce was seeing a really poor adoption and other coins without high fees are not adopted for commerce either. Even if we get the fees down, other things stop commerce from working. Maybe people are happy with what they have, maybe the 10 minute transaction time was to long, maybe it's to hard to support it, maybe merchants don't like the volatility, I have no idea.

Felt safe with my hot wallet on my work laptop that I was carrying around, forgetting in bars bringing to festivals etc for 4+ years, then one day i tried importing my private key into another wallet for some reason. 2 years ago all money were moved to to different adresses.
This was when I made some online purchase, I nearly had a hart attack and a couple of bad hours before I figured out the problem. Have a much better setup now with offsite backup etc.

@_date: 2017-12-05 20:16:54
Say I have a bitcoin, why not just open a few channels with it? Sometimes money will go through your node if you have a good channel and you get a bit of free money. If there is a lot of people doing this the amount I make will be less, and a few people will drop off, the amount left will go up. Some people will think it's worth it some won't. If to few people think it's worth the fee might get a little bit higher (but still a lot cheaper than  mining because you don't need a lot of electricity!) It will find an equlibrium.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:28:11

a couple of things:
1, When the network is crammed, it's fairly cheap to increase the problem.
2, Bitcoin price plummets when the fees increase, lots of money to be made on shorting.
3, apparently, this is a lot cheaper for miners to do, i don't know more about this.
4, You can clearly see the spam attacks in the ledger, in periods a lot of transactions are made in a way to take as much space as fast as possible.
With all this said, there is no such thing as "spam", the bitcoin protocol creates rules that say that anyone can write whatever they want to the blockchain if they pay the right price.

Very insightful post, i don't think Bitcoin has to replace money to be very valuable, I would love to see that, but have also realized that if Bitcoin becomes a store of value, it will be a lot easier for other projects to become viable on top.

There are some stupid stuff, like randomisers using javascript Math.random() and brain wallets, that can be more easily cracked, but apart from that, I think this is very safe in practice (as opposed to online exchanges that get hacked all the time)
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:27:02
It could be a security thing, their cold stoage has a delay, maybe sends out a couple of text-messages to selected parties or maybe in the case of a kidnapping or something like that. Also a cold storage is not connected to the internet, so you need physical access.

I'm not trying to arhue for bigger blocks, don't think its feasible, bit with the current transaction costs, there is really no good alternative to ln.
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:10:16
lol, allthough, I think there is a difference, very soon big invesments, like pension-funds will get access to bitcoin, this may be a very large portion of the demand for bitcoin, if they are forced to sell, it could create a crash that is hard to recover from.
On the other hand, if they own bitcoin, the probability of it being illegalized does decrease.

I'm starting a poll!
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:18:42
that's interesting, people not opting for the segwit will have fewer transactions to chose from, so probably less fees for them, also, it will probably be lesser fees for non segwit transactions, not sure how big the effect will be though...
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:33:36
Totally agree, the idea is that these people should indeed use the bitcoin, but if you do it just right, you can make people save in on the exchange-rate and just trade the bitcoins instead. Then the merchants can do the same, giving out bitcoin as salary, and so it goes. Every time bitcoin gets traded, for food or for labour etc, their value gets certified. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:15:33
Yeah, but as soon as you go into the comments it's all flamewary again :/ Same thing happened when ethereum came around, but not as much with litecoin, no idea why.

if the new coin gets more than 50% of the hash power, it is bitcoin. This is also only true if it happens all at once. Difficulty does change and also, the remaning miners can change the rules if they want to.

Very pro LN, but concerned person here. This is true, but, to run a big node you need lot's of bitcoins (to set up payment channels with everyone), a big node will probably be cheaper to transmit your funds through, this will give it even more capital+possibilites to raise money to get even bigger.
This means that we will probably end up with very few or even one node. What happens when they start raisning the prices, change the lightning protocol or even have governments knocking at the door? 
Anti-money laundering rules are often about knowing who transmits money end-to-end. That means that government could enforce an update to the protocol used, creating a walled garden where only identified and approved users can partisipate, this would also reduce competition and be good for the big nodes.
Cory Doctorow famously said that society is formed by, law, economics, culture and code. Any of theese could potentially remove this problem. Maybe you could build lightning so it doesn't incentivize big nodes as much, maybe we can teach all bitcoinusers that big nodes are cheap but not safe. Maybe we can get government to change the laws on their control over money(probably not the last one) Maybe something else?

@_date: 2017-08-14 18:17:37
This is a lot harder to do with financial assets, if someone even tries to fuck up the system/company/whatever, people tend to just sell their assets.
Not sure where you are in the scaling debate, but some people probably feel that this already happened, to theese people I say, either they are smarter than everyone else or they are wrong. (polls show fairly consistently that people in general believe they outperform the average, unless they are one of the very best)

@_date: 2017-08-25 20:31:47
great writeup! would like to add that as blockrewards go down, the amount of money from payment fees go up, at some point asicboost won't be worth it any more.

Actually, this would happen when people withdraw bitcoins from the exchange. They don't need to move money from cold storage if people are just trading bitcoins. Why they are withdrawing is another question...

It will help some, but the idea is to use second level channels like lightning network to scale a lot, some people don't like this however, for a bunch of different reasons, I'm pretty smart and have tried to figure out what path makes more sense, but I honestly don't have any idea who is right, maybe both directions will/would work, who knows ;)

@_date: 2017-08-24 15:02:09
It's weird that the people who don't like lightning because of the centralization are opposed to segwit being implemented, suppose they don't want it at all, so they prefer a worse version maybe, very lennistic "vote for the worst political candidate to accelerate the speed to a new way".

1) Don't spend money you cannot afford to lose, this is a risky investment.
2) Don't buy all at once, buy a little bit over time to reduce the risk of buying at a top.
@_date: 2016-11-18 13:26:27
Ok, yeah, I get.
Well, I wouldn't label myself a socialist, I just happen to live in a socialist country. But I'm not freemarket libertarian either :P (my relationship with ideologies is somewhat complicated). I concider any country that has any kind of public spending a social-democracy, that's where both sweden and USA would end up, although on different sides of the spectrum.
I think bitcoin is really fasinating from a technical and societal perspective, since it's already around, it's interesting weather I like it or not. I happened to find it and put in some money very early, so that has been nice for me aswell... I don't think the state is founded only on financial power (even though that is a very important part) and I think it still will be possible to collect taxes. Rick Falkwinge proposed going over to flat-tax(basically VAT only) as a solution in a bitcoin world. Bitcoin would also help blocking bad monetary policy, for example in China when they inflate their currency people buy bitcoin, this is interesting because bitcoin doesn't even have to be that huge or successful for this to have an effect. I think this is good and avoids artificial high demands followed by busts, this is a big temptation and problem in any type of government.
A big thing that libertarians seem to see differently than people more left-leaning is that they concider taxation a cost, while left-leaning people concider it common spending. (I do agree that it is sometimes not the most cost-efficient way to achieve your personal goals)
If you concider taxes a cost, the only reason you are paying them is that you risk getting caught. Consumption has lots of other paper trails aswell so you can still get caught and lots of people pay taxes because atleast to some degree they believe in the common project that a country is. If you look at Greece for example, they are now paying lot's of their taxes back to the EU for bailing them out from the last crisis. This is percieved more as a cost than a common good, resulting in very much of the economy kept of the books. I think this view is more common in Europe than in the US in general. If what I believe is correct bitcoin and government can co-exist. But government would have to work harder to prove their worth, which is a good thing to me.
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:54:21
Scaling, hopefully 2nd level solutions will solve thid, but we can't be

Very true, lots of countries are clamping down on physical assets for money laundering and controling inflation, india and gold is an interesting example, here in sweden they are pushing hard against cash for the security of workers and in china they are looko to ban cash for control. This might increase the value of Bitcoin though, like us dollars are desired in a lot of poor countries/sovjet etc
@_date: 2016-11-18 07:34:04
Sorry for the snark, I just couldn't help myself :P
My point was not that socialism is awesome, I just wanted to say that our government has built some great experience in building infrastructure.
I actually make around 55k per year, 29yo, and I can reduce a lot of expenses compared to the US, like free medical care, controlled rents on my living, 5 weeks vacation, 1 years paternaty leave, great(well, decent) public transportation, so no car needed. Also I never spend more than 8 hours in my office (usually less). but I am an anomaly in this country.
Also I think this comparison might be a bit unfair. All employers pay something called social fees. It's a 30% premium that they pay on all salarys. Theese are not taxes but go mostly to your pension and paying your salaries when you get sick(though some parts of them are also socialized). Ideologically I agree that it is weird that you don't get to decide how to spend your own money, but if you want to compare under stand the different financial situations in the countries apple to apple, I think theese should also be included.
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:08:17
I think this is a very bad advice. It's true they are experts, but they are not necisserily honest. Also they are a lot more attractive and visible target than you are. It's not super hard to create a paper wallet and send your funds to that actually. I concider online exchanges very unsafe, i'd rather keep them on my own computer for example. Way more money has been lost on exchanges than from hacking individuals, i'm sure of it. Individuals mostly loose their coins, they don't get hacked.
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:02:16
I see your point, but total transaction cost or total transaction cost per month makes a lot more sense for a user, If I need to make 100 transactions, I need to make a 100 transactions.

Blockchain transactions does not represent economic activity, it might as well be someone sending coins back and forth between two wallets.

@_date: 2017-11-10 23:24:25
Yes, this is exactly what I mean. A payment channel where you have funds is a kind of an IOU, so that's why I used the word debt. WatchTower seems like a great technology, I'm really looking forward to all of this coming out! Last time national currencies came with any upgrades it was when they dropped the gold standard and that was a definitely a contentious fork that noone had the power to stop, i sure prefer the bitcoin releasenotes!
Could you recommend any news-sources/blogs/youtubechannels etc where you get theese kinds of news.
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:32:28
Really? Where can i use it to trade?
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:51:32
This was really helpful thankyou! When I have been thinking of lightning I have been thinking of a hub-and-spoke/distributed model, rather than a mesh/decentraliced model. The things you say do suggest that clients that promote the mesh-model(random payment-channels) will be cheaper to use, that makes me very happy! However, in a mesh network, most users must have more than one open payment-channel. But it doesn't matter as much if you don't have to close them to often.
One possible reason you would want to close your channels is if you have a lot of dept in them: If you lose connection to the blockchain and the counter-party tries to steal your funds, you need to close the channel, so you don't want to have to much dept in there.

I agree that if it dies it deserves to die, but the community and a possible sense of duty is also a part of bitcoin, so if that saves it, it deserves to live, imo.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:57:30
Net neutrality is super important, but this is probably one of the smallest concerns. It's really hard to target a specific service, like bitcoin and block it. You can get stuff on to the blockchain in so many different ways. Net neutrality is usually about giving certain types of traffic a priority thus giving them an competitve advantage.
Being a bitcoin user does not require a lot of bandwith, so you don't really benefit from a priority. Maybe if you are a full node operator, but that is gonna become a more and more professionalized thing from here on. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:10:25

@_date: 2017-11-22 13:50:43
Two very strong correlations, one this summer, bitcoin marketshare was suddenly flipping torwards ethereum as transaction-prcies skyrocketed and caused panic, flipping back after the fork was done. The second was last weekend where a similair thing happened but torwards bitcoin cash.
The congestion is often pushed up by spam, but it doesn't make the statement any less true.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:02:30

@_date: 2017-11-09 12:15:34
thx, it seems my knowledge of the lightning network is a bit outdated, i have tried reading the speccs but they are way to technical for me. Do you have any recommendations?
1. I know it's not mandatory to close them but when I have asked the question, people who seemed techincally knowledgable said you will probably wanna settle anyways, never got an answer on why though. Would love some more details on this.
2. I had no idea you could refinance payment-channels without writing to the blockchain, I thought a paymentchannel basically was a transaction stored on the blockchain. Do you have any more info on this?
2&amp;3: the scenario i'm talking about is when you relay other peoples transactions. That means that you need to be connected to atleast two other people, right? Also depending on your connections, you will probably have a bias in one direction for where money is flowing, not sure if refinancing makes sense for this scenario either.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:59:41
I don't think this is about the convinience or usabillity of bitcoin. When congestions happens suddenly and transactions stop going through, it causes uncertainty and panic, markets react to this strongly.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:20:06
I think this reasoning is wrong, the money generation is already known, this means that the rate of new money entering the system in the future is already priced in.
As a proof: Imagine if everybody got together tomorrow and decided to just not make any more bitcoins. The price would skyrocket!
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:30:17




How did you come up with this number? agree 100% if this is true.
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:38:02
This is good, but 1$ is still way to much if you want bitcoin to compete for coffee type transactions. I know lot's of stuff is in the pipe to solve this, but we need to be vigilant as a community and not adhere to groupthink. Just because we used to have 6 USD transactions, doesn't mean 1 USD is good enough.
Great improvement though!

@_date: 2017-11-02 21:26:12
I think it's priced in, IE people buying coins now know they will get free coins after the fork, so they add that to the price estimate, after the fork, this will be removed from the price-estimate.

@_date: 2017-04-12 09:38:58
Yeah, I do believe it's for a couple of reasons.
- Reduce risk of robberies. Safe working enviroments and workers rights is a big political topic here due to our socialistdemocratic roots.
- Strike out against organized crime. Lots of money is laundered through the few cash intensive busninesses still around.
- Find tax-evasion from primarely small businesses. (I don't think this is a big a motivation as some people imagine, atleast not in the debate. It's hard work to catch all the small tax evasions. Big business is more bang for the buck.
Sweden is very debit-card based already, the paymentsystems work well and fast so it's just easier than carrying a bunch of cash around. Most people I know rarely ever use cash to start with.

The problem with coins like yours is that you cannot validate their authenticity without internet. There are (or have been atleast) physical coins that are hard to fake, that also had private keys so they could be redeemed onto the blockchain. This requires some trust of a central authority, but is still way better than fiat because you cannot just go around printing more money if you want to.

I concider economics a part of how bitcoins works, atleast to some degree. I don't think tech is the only knowledge required, but atleast to me, the technical discussions are on a much higher level. I work as a developer and have some insight into how bitcoin work, but mostly I don't have a clue about what arguments hold and what arguments don't hold in terms of security/scalability etc. 
The economic arguments I have seen on the other hand are pretty straight forward with simple analogies like "how many people fit on a bus" supply/demand monopolistic possibilities etc.

They don't have to know what wallets belong to what company, so they don't know different companies assets either.
They don't control a private key. They can never do anything without the conscent of either the user or the service. Again, this is giving away less control than it is to put your money in an exchange, because then the exchange can do whatever they want with the money.
This is not destroying free markets, using these foundations would be volontary. 
You would have to hack both the foundation and the exchange at the same time in order to extract any money.
This is not required for any company that accepts bitcoin, it's only for the companies that hold other peoples bitcoins, like an exchange.

If someone hacks an exchange with this setup, they can take all bitcoins instantly.
If the exchange had this setup and someone hacks it, they also have to hack the foundation aswell before they can take the bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-09-05 15:08:21
They don't control the private keys, because they need approval from the service or the user to do anything with the keys. An analogy would be that they have the map but not the coordinates, where the treasure is hidden.
It's not every site either, again only companies that hold other peoples bitcoins, like exchanges.
@_date: 2018-03-04 22:23:50
This is not how supply and demand works. This still increases the demand.
The brokers have to buy the coins from someone and those people can't put the coins up on exchanges if they sell them to the brokers for example.

I don't believe in his basic assumptions. Apperently lots of people don't trust themselves enough to keep their own private keys(I'm not one of them, and feel it's a false sense of security) It feels convenient and we are used to leaving important stuff, like keeping our money to professionals.
Also lots of people who want to do ponzi-scheme type of things like fractional reserves etc, even if the exchanges go away, and we need a way for them to prove to us they keep their money. (I personally believe in direct models like bitsquare).

I dont think bitcoin will work if someone has all the keys, specially if that is a banjk. It will be to easy to regulate to distinction. I users know how to keep physical objects safe, in like a bankvault, I think the private keys should be a more core part of the hardware wallets. You should get a sealable envelope and more instrucitons on what they are and why they are important. Recommendations on how to keep them safe etc.

I don't think big-blocks is the right solution, here is however the answer as far as I undestand it.
1, The proposed alternative: lightning network isn't peer2peer either since it will go through a distributed (different from decentralized) system of payment nodes. Therefore, we don't have any available solutions for scaling bitcoin in a peer2peer manner.
2, right now is more important: in a lot of places bitcoin works as a peer2peer cash system as long as the fees are decent. Once we get congestion and the fees go up. People stop using it for cash transfer. This is really useful and valueable right now for those people and we should care about that. Right now, the regulators and big business haven't caught up with us and we need to move value out of the old system to grow big enough before we get blocked. In the long run, we can probably solve this or in worst case use another crypto currency. Once it's decentralised it's a lot easier to swtich between different systems.

bisq (formerly bitsquare) is doing a colored coin ICO, they don't sell coins however, they give coins to anybody who has previously contributed to the project.

You are not understanding me correctly, on purpose I suspect :P. In practice you cannot use bitcoin without the services around it. You need to get the bitcoins, you need to transfer them to other people. I you as a company want to charge with bitcoin, you need to bring the money back into the fiat economy to pay taxes etc. Most bitcoin transactions are facilitated by some sort of service, and even if there is a pure bitcoin economy, it suffers aswell when the support-service bitcoin economy fucks up.
The foundations does not need to be centralized, no more than the miners or exchanges. (even less so actually, exchanges benefit from being centralized, because of the network effect, these foundations does not benefit in the same way.) I'm proposing more of a protocol for how the foundations would rate different services, so they would be comparable.
The foundations can't actually take the money, they need the apporval of either the exchange or the end user in order to do so. This sceme would actually be the opposite: when you put bitcoin into an exchange you give them the same trust as a bank (or even more because there is no oversight) if we added the foundations like this, you would not need to trust the exchange in that way.

Atleast they don't have to close! That's good news for me.!


Would love to know more about these other disadvantages.


It's probably technically easy, to set up a node, but the stuff I'm thinking of is the marketing and legal. This is stuff like making deals with the most successful wallets to be a default connection (or build your own wallet). Making deals with the biggest vendors, running ads etc. When I think of it I'm pretty sure that running a node that passes a lot of money through it is already a type of business that will be regulated in most western countries by current laws, it most certainly will be if not already, maybe bitcoins status as not a currency makes it non-regulated for now. This means Know Your Customer(Id) Anti money laundering/anti terrorism(where did you get this money) reporting to the IRS etc. You can't send assets abroad however you like, so maybe it's already illegal, but otherwise government could demand that lightning payments goes through regulated nodes. (this is basically how they did it with traditional banking). This will not hinder everybody, but the sentesnses for financial crime are really high, so most people will choose nodes that are regulated, probably enough to give them a competitive advantage. 
The thing with free markets is that non of the participants(nodes) benefit from the market being free, so it's in their best interest to make sure there is as little competition as possible.


I sure hope so, but that scaling on chain is a bad idea doesn't make scaling of-chain a good idea unfortunately. Luckily, lightning is off chain, so there are more possibilities for competing
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:48:03
How did you come up with 10%? It's much slower before. Tech adoption follows an s-curve generally, but it's not really up yo the users to pick segwit or not, but more centralised agents. Also, it's really hard to predict when the hockey-stick takes of.

@_date: 2017-09-08 12:55:31
this is a false dichotomy, That bch is doomed to fail doesn't meant that btc will automatically succeed. I agree that scaling on chain to visa-level is impossible, but I don't thinkt that lightning network will be a permanent solution either. Lightning network is not centrelized, only distributed, it makes it vulnerable to censorship (think about torrent tracking sites for example). Blockchain scales badly, it makes it a bad case for small transactions. They both suck in their own unique horrible snowflaky way. I think we need to put as much capacity as possible and probably other scaling solutions (and altcoins) aswell if cryptocurrency is ever gonna beat banks.
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:23:53
Not sure if it's a problem. I suppose that depends on how much impact segwit has in practice, how fast the transaction speed increases and how much money people spend on spamming the network. I haven't done the numbers. Just think it's important that everypne has as good info as possible.

Some really insightful comments here, I do agree that bitcoins non inflationary nature will be a challenge for pushing consumption in traditional trading but someone here pointed out: you don't buy to avoid inflation, you buy vecause you need stuff.
Second, it's common that stores of value start being used as currency, gold is one example but cigarettes in prison is another one.

Not exactly true afaik,you can transmit only on one. As long as noone transmits the same transaction on the other chain you are fine. If someone is transmitting your transaction on the other network and you are you are lucky, your transactions will go through first and you achieved the split, if you are unlucky, the other users transaction goes through first and your coins end up in the same adreses on both chains, but you have both the private keys. Not sure how this works but I believe you will automatically still see your coins in most applications if you have a HD-wallet.

Hrm, maybe I haven't understood this correctly... I think we have a very different picture of how this will play out once lighting is in place. I think lightning is hard to grasp so please let me know if i'm wrong, comming from a very modest place here, trying to understand.
Paymentchannels have an automatic closing time and every time you open or close a paymentchannel it has to be registered to the blockchain, and you have to pay a fee. You also need to reserve bitcoins for each paymentchannel. This means that it will cost money to keep payment-channels open, so each user will want as few channels open as possible
Every node between the sender and recipient of the bitcoins can charge a fee. This means that users want as few relays as possible in order to keep fees down.
The ideal lighning network topology for this would be a single node in the middle, with everybody connecting to that node. Each user has a single payment channel, and no transaction has more than two jumps. 
In reality, users that trade back and forth a lot might set up a direct payment-channel between each other. And there might be a couple of different nodes like this, they might target different special needs in the market etc. This or theese central nodes can decide who to set up payment channels with and create an oligopol, or they can be forced by government to identify every user and have them explain where big volumes of money come from, so a normal user can't work as a proxy for stuff government doesn't like. This is bascially the demands that governments put on banks to stop anti terrorism, money laundering etc.
I'm not a big blocker or anything, I think scaling on chain is clearly not sustainable long term.
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:44:30
I'm not sure if big blocks is a good idea, but if we should go that way, we shouldn't wait until the system is congested. Member just a few months ago when the system got congested?

I do agree that layer 1 won't be enough, it will either be offchain or alt-coin or centralized stuff that picks upp the slack if you keep everrything on layer 1.
However, I'm not sure what as secure and decentralized as possible means. Technically 1 transaction/block is the configuration that most people will be able to run. This is obviously not a good idea, so it should have some larger size, not sure if 1mb is best, or 300kb or 10mb or 1000mb.
It's also unrealistic that full nodes will be hosted on individual computers. The blockchain currently fills half my computers harddrive and it will only keep getting bigger regardless of what blocksize we set, it has already outgrown Personal computers in my opinion.

This is not really the reason halvening was added. The finite amount of bitcoins is why halving is in there. None of us really expected this valuation of bitcoin back in the day.

Then tell me this, how come they don't just buy biycoins for cheaper?
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:11:36
Agree, but internet is not available everywhere. You could build a smartphone app that communicates over SMS.
@_date: 2016-05-30 13:11:06
Also, a lot more risky and unpredictable what would happen once the condition of mining changed.

Here is how you loose your coins:
You loose your keys by loosing your computer/usb-drive or hardware/sotware failure.
You accedentally delete your keys when you try to do something sassy.
You use crappy keys, like memory wallets or thirdparty key generators relying on bad randomization.
You put your coins in third-party services that get's hacked or are scams.
Here is how you don't lose your coins:
You get hacked.
Your own stupididty is the greatest threat, specially if you are smart. That should be your top priority when securing your investment.

Not saying you are necessarily wrong, but if you truly believe that the global economy will drop 50% in 10 years, you should buy guns and cans, not bitcoin.
In that scenario, there will be no internet, no electricity, no food in the stores and no gas in the pumps.

According to the whitepaper it can be implemented in any crypto-currency.
@_date: 2017-07-10 09:01:50
The whitepaper contains some more detals, it's a bit to technical for me tbh, 
This is from the whitepaper:
Double-Spending Resistance. A key priority is to ensure that a
broadcast transaction quickly becomes agreed on by the majority of nodes, and cannot later be nullified in some way. Depending on its importance, once the transaction has gained enough weight, from the total of its descendants’ work, it can be deemed impassible: it will no longer be feasible or economical for an adversary to try to displace it.
For any two transactions x and y, we say that x conflicts with y if for any honest party U accounting for incoming transactions, U can accept either x or y but not both. There are a few ways for conflicts to occur, with the most obvious ones being of two transactions attempting to make payments from the same source, and of a transaction attempting to extract too much value from an insufficient source. We refer to both as instances of double.

a198c0077124bab9978e9d4b60deb7e43dc6e394f987e90d00fc6ec98c2bdde5-000, why?
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:48:36
When I read this I had a thought, why is it important that all users have all of the transactions? Why can't there be different branches of the blockchain that is kept track of separately? Kind of like how bittorrentw work? Why do we need to keep the entire blockchain around (I understand that services like blockexplorer need it, but why everyone else)
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:27:42
Came here to say this too :)

Atleast in Sweden most savings-accounts minus yearly fee will result in negative rates unless you have some really huge amounts of money. 500 sek yealy fee, 0.1% interest is kind of common on the big banks.
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:32:17
I agree with the transparency, however this would not be solved with bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't store who spent money or on what. You could use bitcoin to verify transactions, but you would have to get the info from the spender either way, this is the real problem. If you got the info from the spender, you could verify it against a bank account.  This is called double entry and has worked solidly for 100s of years. (bitcoin is an example of triple entry, it is a bit harder to falsify, but that is not the big challenge here)
I love bitcoin it as awesome properties. It's permissionless, non deflationary, borderlessprivate, programmable and a lot of other awesome stuff.  But I feel it's importat we know what value it can add.
@_date: 2017-05-08 06:33:45
Why is this sticky?
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:34:58
But still, if all currencies in the world drop 50%, that's gonna have similar impacts.
@_date: 2016-07-25 07:47:14
This is technically possible, but I doubt you will find a bank that allow you to open this kind of account due to money laundering laws. You basically has to know about your customers in order to run a bank account.
@_date: 2016-05-30 13:21:37
This makes sense but wouldn't it be better for them to just buy bitcoins?
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:07:33
If you want transparency, you could do that just aswell without bitcoin, if transactions are hidden or obfuscated now, they could be so on the blockchain aswell. This is not a problem crypto currencies can solve.
I don't think bitcoin should be a tool for transparency. Rather the opposite, bitcoin should work to make all transactions more private. If transactions are not private by default, this hinders fungibillity, meaning all coins are not created equal. Government could ban certain coins that are not KYC/AML/Processed by licensed banks or whatever other rules they want to make up. This has been identified as the moste exposed attack vector against bitcoin by for example Andreas Anthonopolus.
Ofcorse you could keep a separate database to keep track of the transactions on the blockchain, but you could do that with fiat aswell.

 yeah I saw you, I just kind of wanted to get the ball rolling, I was thinking about setting up the bots to do it and would like to hear what people were thinking, not for now though...

Adding support for local coin i think...

altcoin is the real user activated softfork!
@_date: 2016-05-18 13:39:08
It's really not a scam, ofcourse the exchanges has blocks against this, do you really think I'm that stupid.
First I tried to buy ethereum using shifty, they have a 10 min time frame for buying coins. I used the default suggested payment but it wasn't enough due to the shitty blocksize restrictions.
Second I tried to do an exchange on bitsquare, but my internet timed out and now I can't see my transactin anywhere in the application.

Saw a ccc speach on brainwallets, since there are not that many words and most users use the same tools for generating their brainwallets the number of true passwords are not that great and the speaker could show that they had actually been cracked a couple of times by bruteforce.
@_date: 2018-12-06 17:27:20
yeah, but you can unlock them by closing the channels, I guess that's two onchain fees for opening the channels and two for closing them again. No idea what size they are.
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:45:25
if you just use random letters rather than word-combinations, there are 100s of millions or more possible combinations, this makes it a lot harder to guess the right one, many implementations of word wallets are so easy to crack that just leaving a computer running guessing different wordcombinations will allow someone to steal your wallet. This is an ongoing attack against the blockchain and it is proven that it works so if you use brain wallets you need to be really sure that you know what you are doing.
I'm not here to argue about this. I don't really care if you use shitty security for your coins, just thought it would be nice to leave this info here as a public service.
@_date: 2016-07-04 12:25:41
What are the security risks of a hard fork?
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:26:37
1) Never ever invest money you can't afford to loose. Bitcoin is a really high risk bet and even if the potential upside is big, you can also loose a lot more money than many more regulated assets.
2) You are young so you have more time than money. Invest in learning about crypto and how it works, find whatever aspect is interesting for you. But stay away from shitty investment-advice. No one knows what they are talking about, specially not the once who think they can predict price. The tech, community building or economic theory are some areas that you could look into. I like Andrea Antonopoulos talks on youtube, but there are many others. Be skeptic and look for different sources!
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:29:55
does anyone have an idea of the cause of this? What would it cost to create these metrics?

Neat, predictious would actually work in my case.
It's kind of weird to like bitcoin but hate derivatives. I think we are bound to see some very weird and complex financial products based on bitcoin in the future. It's so easy to build on upon and hard to regulate.
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:03:31
After looking at predictions, something like that would be great, but with a less polarized system, where buyers and sellers could find a price based on supply and demand.
