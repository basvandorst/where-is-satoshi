Someone gave gold to the wrong post! 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:33:22
I would like to hear more too,

I heard that at 17k and 16k and 15k and 14k and 13k now 12k...
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:22:11
I like this comment very much :)

Isn't that already happening with people convincing themselves it will be worth $100,000 by Christmas?

Just open GDAX in a tab and the price will update on the tab itself.
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:33:36
Or you're down 50% considering you could have cashed out at 19k and brought back in today which would have given you the 50% profits you have today, but without losing any of your coins
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:07:08
Yes you can. You sell now and buy back in at 8k in a week or so 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:21:25
People said that about never going back to 10k 
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:22:42
I assume all those who "DCA'd in" from 18k to 16k do.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:12:32
How cool you can be surely depends as much on how many coins you brought as to how much you paid for it. I'd be cool if I brought &lt;$2k at $18k per BTC - not so cool if I'd brought 10 bitcoins...
Perspective, surely.

When did you buy? What made you buy? What would you advise a regular guy to do if he wanted to invest now?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:47:24
when and how long would that take - in your guesstimation?
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:39:48
Yeah they've been quiet on marketing the actual details funnily enough. Total con in my opinion - even though I love Revolut.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:54:14
Doesn't it work both ways though? A large proportion of those promoting Bitcoin, "Buying the dip" and "HODLing" are new accounts...

Why do you assume I want you to do something?
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:07:47


I believe it's because moderate daily alcohol consumption helps reduce stress.

Once there was this kid who...
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:02:09
Lloyd's &gt; Revolut 
@_date: 2018-02-17 07:21:03
Haha obvious pump account 
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:24:03


How exactly does this mean the possibility of $4k bitcoin is over? 
There have been spikes all the way down from 20k.
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:25:06
It's dropped from 20k to 8k in a very short space of time, there is no reason to assume it's stopped dropping.
