Hello my friend, do you know of any way to get XRP? Am trying to get sone to a wallet for a friend in Australia, the Govt isn’t letting them gain access to it. Their address is:
I am looking to get .31 BCH equivalent to them. Shapeshift just isn’t hacking it! 
As ever, THANKS! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:36:46
I just sent you some BCH. Again, thanks for your help, advice and endurance! KeepKey were very helpful, led me to remember I had moved them out of Multi HD to Electrum THEN KeepKey... So I  imported my wallets back into Electrum, got the private keys, used the QR reader in Coinomi... BOOM! x Thanks fellow traveler of the cyber web. I learnt some superb insights from you, and some great tools. Merry Christmas! 
You mean in terms of threatening nuclear war? I don’t know, pushing the envelope far too far. TERRIFYING&gt;

Still waiting to resolve. So, just letting you know I have not slipped off into the cyber ether. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:17:37
Absolutely no worries, it was an excellent knowledge seminar, and I’ve already helped a friend who had the same issues because of what I learnt from you, like I wrote, some great knowledge. 
 Have a great weekend!

Kapiche. Will need to set up my old Multibit HD then. Time stamp and etc, etc available. Thought Bitcoin Gold was stopped, didn’t go ahead? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:08:27
I transferred them @ 2017-08-02 08:51. Block 4786””.
How do I find the old public address? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:03:28
Using Blockchair  --and copy pasting both Public Key and Addresses-- No results ��.
I had the BTC in Multibit HD wallets until August 2nd 2017, then moved them to a Keepkey. I have the BTC --on the Keepkey-- so, where’s the BHC? Associated with the BTC I have? But not according to the Hardfork literature --your BHC will be with your Multibit addresses-- and what my Keepkey is presenting me before my eyes, i.e. No BHC in the BHC account.
Well, I just checked a tiny test amount’s address in Blockchair (Different PC, different server etc):
Last seen receiving 2017-03-11 00:54 Total received 0.00092500 BCH*
So, this BTC sat in this Keepkey has BHC but isn’t showing ‘revealing?’ it... How do we get it...
Put the Keepkey seed into a BHC accepting wallet? It can’t be that easy, can it?
Just FYI I also posted this to self.keepkey, but any ‘delivery of BHC’ will see me reward you. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:12:26
Again, thank you so much for your insights, knowledge. Will get back into it tomorrow and hopefully secure some success!

I transferred them @ 2017-08-02 08:51. Block 4786””. The first BCH block was 478559. (Pretty damn close, but numbers are truth and there it is.)
I am UTC +9, (So it would have been 23:51 UTC) but that still leaves me outside the 'time zone', doesn’t it? 
From Wikipedia:
“Bitcoin Cash cryptocurrency wallet started to reject BTC block and BTC transactions since 13:20 UTC, August 1, 2017 because it used a timer to initiate a fork. It implements a block size increase to 8 MB. Bitcoin Cash started futures trading at 0.5 BTC on July 23, but dropped to 0.1 BTC by July 30. Market cap appeared since 23:15 UTC, August 1, 2017”
It is my understanding that: If it was BEFORE the fork, they’d automically load into Keepkey but there is no BCH in the BCH account I added to Keepkey.

There are three columns of 20 each. 
Address | Public Key | Private Key
I copied and pasted Address and Public. All of the little buggers. BCH 0.
K and L compressed format.
So, change address issue? 
But, I did copy and paste that tiny test private number and it came back as BTC and BCH.

Will do. Going to post myself to bed and then have another look over the next few days. I am going to keep with you MrMish, and hopefully when it all falls into place I can show my appreciation.

Went offline, did the bit address and generated the WIF QR Codes, scanned... “The private key does not contain any funds” (Very cool piece of outside the box thinking BTW and interesting tool resource!)
When I go into KeepKey (KK) into the BTC Account &gt; Transactions &gt; Copy and Paste the addresses into Blockdozer... the BCH are "present... revealed, unhidden" 
Only problem being Coinomi does not recognise the QR generated by Blockerdozer, not sure if it is a private key, obviously not. I think we have progress, we have found the BCH, proof of existence, from my KK addresses --have checked, now to access them.
Thanks for all your guidance etc again. Am sure you have gone to Zzzz land so hope to deliver some news tomorrow.  
Notes to self:
AND...  mined Aug 1, 2017 10:08:34 PM
So that Block number is wrong?? has to be, but it’s the only one I’ve got. But is that time stamp UTC? Or +9, my time zone... 
Issue with Keepkey? The Transaction addresses (Received --sent from Multibit HD-- to my KK) are green, unspent. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:56:35
I went straight to blockdozer with my KeepKey addresses...
It shows the BCH/BCC! 
So why the hell is that --but they are there!(??)-- and why aren’t they showing in Keepkey? 
I can hear the time to the Twilight Zone... How do we access them?
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:34:05
Although not “seeing” them yet, it seems as though I am on the way to digging them out, so, give me a BCH address and as soon as they ‘reveal’ themselves, I’ll send you some for your help. Thanks! 
Bitcoin Gold next... hope KK have it run a little more smoothly, and within a decent time frame. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:25:42
I am going to run the whole process again with: 
Tab BIP32  &gt; Custom derivation path (NOT Multibit HD?) &gt; BIP32 Derivation Path m/0’/1 and m/0’/0 &gt;
Enter BIP39 Mnemonic
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:54:14
What do you think about using: 
See Multibit, and the stand alone bi939, extract public/private keys? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:54:03
Have reestablished my --empty-- Multbit HD wallet, but in Tools, no "export private keys" option. Have sniffed around the internet, no straight forward/safe option that I can find. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:52:48
Thanks, and I will do just that. Thanks for the address, I will let you know when.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:18:47
I now have the Keys, but, I think an important sentence in the Coinomi explanation is: [The following concern only wallets that were funded with BTC prior to the fork (block 478558), and sweeped or about to be sweeped into Coinomi after the fork.]
Being in Multi Bit HD at the time, the BTC were not sweeped or about to be sweeped into Coinomi. So, Coinomi doesn’t sweep the QR codes??? Because, it isn’t, it says the private key doesn’t have any funds when sweeping with Coinomi receiving withBitcoinCash. BUT, I do now have the private keys.
