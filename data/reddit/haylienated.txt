I lived there for 8 years and travel there regularly for work so no, you’re wrong. Don’t believe me, ask the cops or immigration officers. Better yet, tell a local so they can turn you in for a cash reward because that too is a thing

Ok sure, but what you’re only now accepting is common sense, was my point in the first place ...you wouldn’t learnt this when researching.
There’s no reason why you can’t find someone for a bitcoin/cash exchange in Bangkok or ask your friends/family to western union you money.

Yes you do. And if you weren’t asked you should have read up on it when you checked out your visa info before you left. You can get in serious trouble and Thailand authorities never mess around with that stuff, especially these days

Not if you’re roughing it at the likes of hostels. 10K can last an entire month and I highly doubt anyone would travel with only 10K thb (approx 300USD) on them. This just sounds really weird.

This is true, you’re frustrating. I don’t do well with stupid people ...a work in progress
@_date: 2018-08-03 13:36:15
you’re an idiot 
Don’t say you weren’t warned

For not meeting the entry requirements (meaning you have sufficient amount of funds to cover your stay) . 
They’ve been taking it more and more seriously over the past few years since the tourist deaths and criminals trying to use Thailand as a hideout.
Someone not asking you about your bank account isn’t an excuse in their eyes because you should’ve found this info out before you left for Thailand when researching visa requirements.
I’d ask family for help if I were you. Western Union will probably be your best bet.

Wtf is wrong with you? Me choosing not to beat my head against the wall by saying the same shit over and over again is not the same as losing what you’re trying to say is an “argument”
There’s no argument to be had here. This is fact.
Let’s try this again....
WHAT YOU ADMITTED AS BEING COMMON SENSE IS RESEARCHING THAT YOU NEEDED MONEY TO COVER YOUR STAY. THAT IS PART OF THE REQUIREMENTS IRRESPECTIVE OF YOU BEING TOLD AT THE GATE. 
People have taken time to attempt to help you figure your shit out because you suck at planning, take it or don’t take it ...instead of being an asshat

That’s your problem not theirs. Getting defensive on reddit isn’t going to change the fact that you’ll get in trouble if you get caught and questioned. They WILL say that you should have researched this information prior to traveling.

How did you get stuck without cash or money in your bank account in Bangkok though? You need proof of cash (minimum 10K THB) to enter the Kingdom :/

All in
