BTC won’t be the only thing that’s going to get pumped, am I right?
@_date: 2018-05-31 12:20:56
Yep the manipulators really screwed it up this time. If they wanted to see a higher rate and support of Crypto adoption they should have boosted the price. Which is why it’s obvious it’s being manipulated in an attempt to destroy/hurt it.

Just make the course free and have these people support you on something like Patron.
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:57:31
Yes and it so misleading. Bitcoin is btc while bch is Bcash... why do they even have it? That’s like me running a company that sells beds, and I name it Soda Pop makes absolutely no sense. Just straight out fraud! But wait! Thats not all! Our beds are the real Soda Pop! Goes down soft and smooth...��

I think you missed the point entirely to roast someone you don’t know. You don’t know his situation, not everyone has things lined up right. What he’s trying to get to is that after paying all his bills he had $12.00 left in the bank. But the bank charged him $25.00. He’s trying to say does the bank really need to do this while he has 12$ in there?  Sure he could move to another bank go with a Credit union that don’t charge you a fee if you don’t hold enough in the account. This is a common theme amongst low income families so he’s not alone. Instead of being a douche why not recommend a solution? Geez bro love not hate!
Thats awesome bro! Join the community and contribute anyway you can! Learn to code, write reviews on Dapps that use Blockchain Technology, host a lightning network, run a node for your favorite Altcoin. Educate the public on what Blockchain technology can do for them. Lots of ways you can contribute to the movement. Sorry to hear that about your dad, i’m sure things will turn around for the better. Remember no matter how hard life hits you keep your head up and push and work hard to change your situation. That way you can insure your dad never has to worry about money again.

I remember watching a video about Venezuela and how the people were suffering Economically. The people had EVERYTHING given to them by the government and now they can’t support themselves with low supply and sky rocketed priced... Crypto would be the perfect way to fix it.
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:07:29
No way...

Build it and they will come...
@_date: 2018-04-29 10:42:19
BCore as you hear it is actually Bitcoin (BTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCash) is an Alternative Coin copied from Bitcoin. Buy the real Bitcoin (BTC) which haters refer to as Bitcoin Core to make it sound like their fraudulent BCash aka Bitcoin Cash. So, don’t make a mistake and buy Bitcoin Cash (BCH) aka BCash cause its a copy, and is probably going to dump because of a  pending class action lawsuit against it’s creator for fraud. He’s also a know felon who fled the US and now lives overseas. 
So be sure to only buy Bitcoin (BTC). You don’t want to lose all your money!
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:56:36

Yup! ������ ��

That’s what I’m wondering. No sense in moving there if it sucks!
@_date: 2018-04-21 06:17:32
Well it looks like you were hacked with a bot script and not directly by an individual. And it has to have been a website you had open while using your ledger. Do you ever use MEW to transfer btc? If so that would explain the script attack that targets Bitcoin and which is why you still have your ETH. If you were directly targeted ALL your coin would be gone. Anti Spyware and good Firewall is very important.  Sorry to say this but you may have lost your btc. But you could go over all the websites in your history to check which one it might have been. Look at your logs too! Cause you could have someone do a deep trace to find who it is. But if the culprit really knows what they’re doing it’s over.Everyone is saying keylog, but I think you were exploited through your browser cause most anti viruses will catch those fast because of the way they are made to work.
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:50:40
It’s easy, one word ‘fraud”.
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:31:53
