My logic was that 2 US wars cost 2 trillion dollars and 1 economic recession required just about the same USD to be printed. I don't find that ironic. Second there is a reason China and other nations argue against USD as the worlds reserve currency. The more broadly used your currency is the more liberty you have to take on debt and/or print more without watering down its value too much.
For countries that operate in a surplus reducing the currency base by removing one of your consumption dollars from it may do nothing other than give you a good feeling. But for any country operating with debt, this act has actual impact.
Saying that not using a dollar may help defund a war is only as absurd as saying recycling a can helps save the planet.

The article is not really about Bitcoin. You could remove all the features of Bitcoin that people talk about, replace it with "nearly" any other crypto currency and you would still have this new ease of selective divestment.

since when was bitcoin.com anyone's favorite website? Isn't it mired in a shady history of companies desperate to hijack bitcoin.org social capital?

as a hacker I found the technical level refreshing. It's still simplified but for the purpose of time and dramatic effect. sometimes the story is really grabbing. mostly when it's running off of fight-club-like twists it's pretty boring, if only because the hat-tip to fight-club style is just too noticeable. and the last two episodes from season one felt really rushed. the global conspiracy / super villain thing at the end felt more like marvel comics crap. curious if season too will go more in the super hero direction or stick to the grungy punk area instead. if they want to really keep it real then they should still with the punk + "hackers are fucked up" theme

you know a farmers market provides where you buy goods from a random stand using anonymous case presents the same issues. There is plenty of grey area, hence market, where legitimate business exists with a desire for laxed regulation during low volume market exploration of product distribution.

arbitrage or other bots. they can use this as a technique to study or detect other bots

you are overlooking the space between distrust of a random source of goods and willingness to try anyway. Within that space there is room for a producer to explore selling and I suppose they might like to avoid regulations, despite being a small market.

I'd just like to note that .bit tld within namecoin ecosystem should be considered unstable for now. I purchased a .bit tld from the most referenced and first registrar a year ago (dot-bit.org, for $/btc transfered to the registrar) and have received  no response considering renewal requests or details on how to renew or receive ownership of domain. This is the case for a week+ now. So, if you go down this path run namecoin on your own server to obtain rights to a domain (linux only atm).

you could pay your hosting service with bitcoin, that is one service that that there are [plenty of companies accepting btc for]( You can use an exchange, obviously. You could throw it all into deterministic bitcoin gambling sites to wash it if you so desire. Exactly how is 98% of incoming funds via bitcoin worse than 0% via paypal? Sounds like torrentfreak.com interviewed someone that has little to no funds to speak of. next.
