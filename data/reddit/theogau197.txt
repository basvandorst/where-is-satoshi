Considering the already massive adoption of tapandgo/paywave in Australia one would expect the adoption of Android Pay to be rapid and extensive once it lands. What are your thoughts regarding how this will impact Bitcoin use/adoption?

3x Trezors = €178 
3x Ledger Nano S = €137.46

No you misunderstood, to clear things up I think Ledger is better AND cheaper.
Here's something for you to chew on for a few hours..
OK I've got a Bitcoin worth 1 Bitcoin, 
do you want to pay 2 bitcoins for it or 0.75 Bitcoins?

Higher price for a less desirable item is not a better offer.
But hey if you think the Trezor is that much better go for it.

 Trezor is also offering a discount.

Easy...Ledger, cheaper, more coin types and they are having 21% off for black fri

Nah, he's right. The MK1 is total beta tester junk. I bought two and can't get either to work.
Have so far tried half a dozen of each of both powerbanks and wall chargers. Coldcard stayed on with one wall charger albeit with non functioning/erratic key presses and after the upgraded firmware thought it was finally gonna work. Nope: gets as far as displaying my seed words and lets me scroll to word 13 before moving in reverse then totally freezing.
Hardly something you'd use to safeguard your sovereign wealth.
