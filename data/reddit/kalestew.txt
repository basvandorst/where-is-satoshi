But where are the discussions of evolving bitcoin into anything more modern? LN and segwit are not modern. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:13:36
They do. You can use any Authy key in google. 
If you need help, google is your friend. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:31:51
Because lightning is *not* ready. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:24:13
What the luck. 
I love how you get some downvotes...
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:22:57
Hold on, my Bitcoin focused charity is not going to use *Bitcoin* to send the **millions**. 
What *is* Bitcoin for?
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:58:08
So do you. Besides he is not deeply involved technically, talk to some devs, the bitcrust guys might be a sane start. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:51:09
Humm the sms seems like a pretty specific use case. I wonder if there are any work arounds for what you mention. Might be a bit of an uncommon problem. 
Let us know if you find anything, I’ll be sure to do the same!
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:53:40
Yeah and they were actually pretty angry about having to pay thousands of dollars in fees to get their money to the charities who need it...

1. How is that secret?
2. What is wrong with wrong with that as a consensus parameter if it is not contentious?
You speak about hard forks like they are the end of the world. What is wrong with consensus? let's just call them full node referendums like they really are.
@_date: 2017-03-31 17:59:56
that certainly doesn't make his point true.
@_date: 2017-03-31 16:29:03
He can't because those allegations are not true...
@_date: 2017-03-31 23:36:32
thanks xhiggy. /thread
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:44:22
Because I want to open a payment channel for every single transaction!!
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:54:00
Or just continue to use Bitcoin with all the security benefits intended by the Bitcoin protocol as outlined in the white paper. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:37:38
Telling me to read the white paper, what a nerve. Where do I make an incorrect claim?
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:35:17
It is more complicated than that. What you talk about is centralizing. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:27:27
Totally not true. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:48:15
Like I’d want more than a few thousand flowin into my vanity. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:44:05
I really love how reducing the mempool size and basically adding a useless node to the network is praised. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 03:02:30
Yeah, it is called DDOS. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:48:47
Lol, dude. Digging themselves into a hole? How so?
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:05:55
Lol how do you know. RSK and ETH are much different. There is no conflating...
@_date: 2017-07-08 00:38:23
Typing is very interestingly intuitive. Qwerty keyboard, updates based on how many you've typed. Never seen anything like it. Much better than you think.
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:39:13
No, alphabay bad some unique auto tumble and funny business. I.e keeping the coins on the move. The tx fees were nothing for alpha.  
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:40:26
Well there is no such thing as spam in bitcoin. 
Period. 
There are fee paying and non fee paying transactions. 
I was mainly joking about the AB thing. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:41:19
Your node should probably have more umph than a rpi. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:00:54
Bitcoin was never intended to be run on cheap CPUs 
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:40:21
Realistically it is probably just alpha bay
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:03:43
They shouldn't be for much longer. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:54:27
Look at the Casper github. It is pretty well designed.
