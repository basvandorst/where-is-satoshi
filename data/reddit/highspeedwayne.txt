How do I best explain Bitcoin and Cryptocurreny in general to friends and family. I've got a few coins in several different alts. And I've done a bit of mining with some extra hardware. I've been branded the de-facto expert by my friends and family. I tried to explain it to my dad today, and don't really think I got the point across. 
How do I get it across more effectively?

It was nowhere near that large. But it was the largest amount of Dogecoin I received at one time.

Very cool. I'll definitely use some of those tactics. Maybe not as Cape Fear as the first guy though.

I had heard about Bitcoin, kinda missed the boat on that one. When Dogecoin appeared to be taking off I made a vow not to get left behind again. And it was still at the point where I could mine a little bit with the one or cards I had lying around. Didn't mine much though. My balance got inflated by the rampant tipping. Largest one I got was for making a joke, and it wasn't even that good a joke.

I tried to do a "How it works" to my father today. He used my computer for a moment, and asked about my running miner windows. He's a very nuts and bolts kind of guy, but I think I over simplified.
I'll try that next time.

I posted a similar comment above. I had heard of Bitcoin a long time ago, and had really missed the boat on that one. When it looked like Dogecoin was going to take off, I made a vow to be on board from the word go. So, a Shibe I became.

I just did the conversion. It roughs out to about $1.28. But it seemed bigger because it was 3k ish Doge. Which for making a joke about not doing my actual job seemed pretty good.
I had, before I started playing around with exchanges, about 28k XDG. From what little mining I did, and then tips for days.

It might not be over yet. I'm thinking about getting out of the coin, and just staying in it for the jokes.
