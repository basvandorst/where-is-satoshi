For a moment I thought it was 119.756 
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:24:03
This applies to the DAO hack too. But in either case, I don't think there's a shortage of people who don't give a fuck.  Easy to blame the victims too. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:47:59
It's not always true. If they had kept their coins in a multi-sig paper wallet, it couldn't get hacked and physically stealing it would extremely unlikely. I understand they need to keep some coins readily available.. but not 120k of them. 
I hope some better exchanges advertise how they keep their coins. We need security and trust on exchanges or bitcoin can't work (without liquidity). Luckily the price is rebounding. But this can't keep happening!
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:54:52
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:07:53
Again, I agree. But there still needs to be a market. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:04:33
That's why a multi-sig paper wallet is required. And in the event of a theft, it'd be much easier to find the thief.
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:21:19
Well to be fair, I'm sure they were making a killing off of ETC/BTC and ETC/ETH transaction fees just yesterday :)
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:52:34
I agree. However, for bitcoin to work as a mainstream currency, we need to have secure trustworthy exchanges. 
You can't trade bitcoins easily from a private wallet. Without liquidity, bitcoin would not be stable or mainstream. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 23:09:41
Exactly, let's discourage relatively benign drugs with punishment and hazard, to steer you into alcohol.. 
The costs of enforcement, resultant crime from black markets and extra alcohol consumption plus the costs of needlessly destroying lives directly and indirectly. Can't argue ignorance. It is evil. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:54:17
I agree but for bitcoin to work, you need secure trustworthy exchanges.  You can't trade from a paper wallet very easily and without liquidity, bitcoin can't be stable. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:19:06
It wouldn't even be possible and it's &lt;1% of bitcoins. TO make it the same, you'd need ~7 million stolen bitcoins stuck  in a wallet that can't be moved for a month. Not saying it would fork but this doesn't come close to taking 14% of the coin. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 15:18:20
"Even though the DNM’s provide a safer environment, European officials are poised towards tackling these illicit marketplaces "
How is this not just evil? Basically saying they want more people to get hurt?

What's to stop him revealing the security hole AND keeping all the coins? He could even ask for an extra 1000 coins for the info if he felt like being a dick. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:13:56
Yep. OOps I lost 1BTC, hard fork please! lol (im so clever...)
@_date: 2016-08-22 06:18:22
In a way, these markets are the grey area they could turn a blind eye on. No way will they consider legalization, so this could be a way to let things be if safety is maintained. Then go after violent thugs and scanning street dealers selling bad product. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 12:33:25
The lack of fees could really attract a lot of people. EBay charges 10% nowadays. Saving 10% through open bazaar would be a big deal, especially for big ticket items. I wish it luck. It should have it's own bitcoin exchange. Then you could pay with local currency and convert automatically if you want. 
Needs a mobile version though... 
@_date: 2018-09-24 21:46:11
Could others clarify if this is something to be concerned about coming from core devs? 
@_date: 2018-09-01 02:22:21
You could do this for a while now. But it costs a lot to setup and maintain a self managed super fund. Thousands.   
The real news would be if normal ones could have allocations to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 13:50:04
The yearly fee of $1200 is a bit high though. Especially if someone has less than $100k. I wish there was a better option for smaller accounts. Also, some accounts would have very little activity compared to others. What if I was not doing any trading on the account but just buying and holding?
@_date: 2015-12-26 12:33:30
Everytime this happens, it hurts Bitcoin as you can't have a currency / store of value that regularly spikes and plunges by double digit %. It wasn't that long ago that it plunged 40% in a short period. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 23:53:56
They can still take your car, phone, shoes etc it seems. But the fact there are no protests or riots over this means that the government has the green light to push on for more draconian shit.

@_date: 2018-08-30 12:08:32
Exactly this. They ask for crippling amounts of money to list coins. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:56:40
I don't quite get this. Where do you keep your hardware wallet? What if it gets physically damaged or lost? 
I always felt like a paper wallet is best as you can keep it password protected in multiple places as well as a safety deposit box. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 12:05:48
I'm holding till at least the first bail-in in a major economy. Ideally a few bail-ins in. I think many of us could retire at that point. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 03:43:29
The terms and conditions don't mention anything about that kind of thing. I'd think they would definitely mention it if that were so. I'd say it's maybe badly thought out and may change in the future, but not once you get your 12 month price at least. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 05:00:41
It is somewhat understandable. What if the house burns down? If  word document is zipped up with a good password then it can be very secure. But then if you suddenly die your family can't get the bitcoin. 
This is why it's fully ok to desire some third party to trust with your coins. The main way I can think of is a safety deposit box. 
As decades go by, tehre will probably be a not so insignificant amount of bitcoins stuck in addresses taht no-one can access. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 05:37:17
But if they think that this small aspect justifies the price, then all its utility combined is definitely enough to get to the moon. Whatever that means. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 10:06:30
This may not be the time as the ECB would eat every first born to kick the can forward just another week. However, one day this kind of situation will lead to capital controls / bail-ins in a large economy such as italy's. 
The result will be an epic explosion in BTC. 
The only question then is, do you sell or wait for other countries to commence their own bail-ins? When do you cash in? 
Interesting times ahead...
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:20:01
Yeah i know. Just never got why it became a popular meme. 
@_date: 2017-02-06 05:53:43
I'd guess a 20-30% gain would be reasonable then. 300m would be near 3 times daily volume and much of that isn't trading. So I'd see it rocket and then fall and settle back to 20-30% gain. 
FYI, this is just a guess but feels reasonable. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 00:16:37
Oh I see. I guess since I just keep my coins stored away for the long term, the cold storage paper wallet is fine for me. But yes, if I was regularly wanting to spend them the hardware wallet would be great.
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:44:04
Not a response but i honestly feel that not having bitcoin is very speculative. There are so many ticking time bombs around the world and many of them will lead to bail ins,  inflation or a Venezuela style collapse of society. It would be a miracle if we don't see a crazy GFC2 in the next 10 years. Even if your country is unaffected,  bitcoin would become very popular. 
Of course, even without the above, the future is very bright. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 08:22:01
I always thought it was directly related to that. Seems like a good explanation. Is there any evidence that it was due to something else?
@_date: 2016-01-26 07:15:06
It looks like the whole block size / tech disagreements will be cleared up in the next 1-2 months. The world (at least thinking) that bitcoin no longer has capacity issues and isn't likely to "fork" and lose bitcoins will provide a big boost in confidence and price IMO.
If that happens, however, it will be nothing compared to when the next major bail-in occurs. When Cyprus did a bail-in, Bitcoin exploded like a 40yo virgin. Cyrpus was small though (and claimed as a one-off), but when the same happens in major country like say Greece, Italy, Spain, Japan, Australia etc., I will actually find it scary. You'll find people all across the world trying to protect their money and chasing the new bubble (Bitcoin). It's difficult to predict but a price of $3,000 wouldn't be out of the question. For all we know, people might get suicidal for selling that low. 
On the other hand, governments could simply ban it at that stage and then it would crash to almost nothing. After all, if the US, EU and China all banned it, then it would be worthless. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:46:47
Fully agree mate. Hence my full support. I'm simply saying that if it loses for now,  I'd support the winner with the expectation that segwit and layer 2 technologies would eventually be adopted. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:32:40
I don't know all the details but it's possible he was given false or incomplete information before making the statement.
It does look bad and one reason i support core. However, i really wish to avoid a worse case of the ETH ETC result. Especially with all the alt coins getting attention at the same time. 
A rise to 2mb wouldn't centralise things too much for too long i think and then we could still hopefully move move to segwit. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 07:28:48
I really don't know how Bitcoin could go up in price if you could no longer convert it to local currency. Sure there may be a country where you could but then sending it back to yourself would be hard and all this difficulty alone would crush it's value. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 02:16:19
How will this actually come to be considering the uncompromising divide in the community at the moment? They even mention instant payments? 
@_date: 2016-01-26 08:23:21
Thanks for the explanation. I presume, also, that as adoption increases, it would cause a lot of problems if bitcoin value was wiped out. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:37:58
I never quite got why this was funny or cool. Just like the McBoatFace thing. Kids these days ey? :P
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:32:44
Agreed.  I hope you're right about us winning. Otherwise, i hope you're wrong about them blocking segwit in the future.. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 00:40:49
I'd love to discuss what happens if we do reach $50 txs again. LN doesn't seem ready yet. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:34:40
If we did need to split, then we'd need to implement layer 2 tech really quickly to be the better coin faster.

If bitcoin market cap reaches 2-3% of the gold market cap at current rates, it will be worth around that much. 
Also, as someone here said, if every millionaire in the world wanted just 1 bitcoin, there aren't enough to go around. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:02:15
I don't believe it's true. If off-chain transactions become mainstream and blocks end up only going up to say 100kb, then I'm sure a block size decrease would be fine.
@_date: 2017-01-05 00:44:06
I don't quite get why Bitcoin's market cap of $16-17 billion is considered a criticism. If there's is a chance of it becoming just 1% of a gold replacement, it's got an amazing future ahead. 
That's would be a $70b market cap btw, or a price of ~$4,500USD. Now imagine it REALLY caught on... 
Plus as someone mentioned, if every millionaire in the world wanted just one bitcoin, there wouldn't be enough to go around. That's without considering the fact they would probably want more, as would people worth less and that with only a fraction of that being sold and who knows how many burnt, we'd have quite a supply shortage!  
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:49:18
A digital alternative to gold basically. One that can't be confiscated/taxed and can be easily moved. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:50:53
They forget to mention that for many it is basically a hedge against future inflation or bail in scenarios if we enter a new GFC. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 08:27:50
It's not like China itself has the hashing power. It's a lot of individual miners in individual pools. 
Plus, I think what you'd find in the case of an attempted attack, is many people would fire up their own mining to make the attack fail. I think there is also the option for the network to exclude certain miners so that could shut down the whole attempt instantly. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 00:59:24
I don't know. In the future, it will be because people fear a bail-in and massive devaluation. But I don't know why this is the case now. Maybe just devaluations. I mean almost every country is at a precipice due to some massive bubble created by leaders who are corrupt and/or dishonest about what needs to be done. However, I don't know of anything to be causing the fear now. 
The price is set on the margins though so who knows? You only need a small subgroup to panic and cause such spikes and premiums.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:37:47
People on this subreddit who oppose the segwit2x hard fork. I personally am fine with segwit2x. But building consensus is better then creating a contentious fork. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 23:00:52
That's actually a really good point... and with so many bitcoins being tightly held, plus many lost permanently, supply is even tighter. It does suggest that a massive boom is coming. It will bust too but only partially. And that's before any further cash bans. 
However, our Jesus moment is the first major country having a bail-in. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 04:40:03
This is unavoidable as bitcoin is slowly gaining acceptance and has to go through this volatile growth. Also, keep in mind that  the world economy is in tatters with depressions, cash bans and everyday account bail-ins around the corner. This kind of stuff plays havoc with a safe haven bet like bitcoin.
Like it or not, it's not a great currency. It's more of a substitute for gold that is liquid enough to be used as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:56:49
Yep.  And they'd rather have bitcoin destroyed than agree to a compromise. I just hope it's a minority of maladaptive personalities that ends up marginalised by a rational majority. Because this contentious fork could actually kill bitcoin imo. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 07:54:56
This is one way. Another is a safety deposit box and a will. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 22:56:54
It's still bad for it as a currency. It's not good to have a currency drop by 10% in one day because of rumors it can be banned. We need official endorsements instead, or at least no news. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 00:02:50
Agreed.. but in the context of this subreddit, it is good news. If you hold bitcoins and they take your savings, you're likely to end up being better off than if they hadn't.
@_date: 2016-12-21 23:07:39
I said it elsewhere, our Jesus moment will be a bail-in in a major economy. Bitcoin would go hyper sonic on the way up. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 02:42:09
When did they sell those donated coins? :P
@_date: 2016-12-29 01:55:32
The next halving is around mid 2020 to 6 bitcoins, Mining will still be big as solar prices will have plummeted even further by then. Another halving will likely occur by 2025 and it will still be worth it. That's assuming no massive breakout in prices like many are predicting (i.e $10,000, $100,000 etc.). Even 0.1 BTC rewards per block would be profitable at that point. It's good as it means BTC has a long time to become mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:43:44
Not against that either but segwit2x was the compromise and trying to split the between like its looking is worst thing to do. Hence why not just add stuff to from the wish list? 
@_date: 2016-12-14 07:40:04
I see their point though. If $100 notes are 23% of the total, then why are they so rarely seen. It's almost guaranteed to be part of an underground economy. Still, there are much greater source of evil, like the leaders themselves. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 01:47:50
Yeah i am assuming that bitcoin would rocket if bail ins became a trend. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 12:34:20
1 GhZ doesn't mean 1 billion computations per second. Certainly not going through checking that many nodes.
However, with what I mentioned before, could there not be some recommended set of nodes (could be a list of a few hundred even), to route through. They can charge higher fees but you are free to calculate longer to find a cheaper route. 
Or another way, how about some form of network state sharing? If I just sent money to a Barry 5 hops away, it would be good if someone who also wanted to send to Barry could use that info if they are connected to the first hop of my transaction. Within an hour of my tx the data should usually be good.
@_date: 2019-02-21 05:50:57
If we have that many nodes, surely there'd be a simple path to almost anyone? Could also be a list of recommended hub channels to open to make it even smoother. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 06:42:26
I was hopeful about LN but after seeing how it actually works, it's a little worrying actually. It's not simple.. Maybe whey watch towers it'll be better but not now. 
I think as a consumer, I'd rather have a custodian payment portal where every merchant is signed up and gets my payments. No need to worry about channels, routing, etc. and as I wouldn't keep much on there, hacks wouldn't be a huge issue either. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 10:21:11
Yeah I wasn't talking about custodial LN. More like a paypal type solution. Ideally we get something where u own your keys all throughout but atm, LN just looks too complicated, and thus unused. Hopefully something else comes along that blows it away. Wasn't RSK meant to?
@_date: 2017-04-25 11:35:08

@_date: 2017-04-27 14:48:33
Come on man, no need for hostility. I'm all for bit coin and I'm worried about it. I guess i don't quite get the contingency plans.

We will see in the next response from csw lawyers.
@_date: 2016-02-02 23:16:07
This shouldn't impact people moving their currency to bitcoin to keep their cash safe from bailouts. But it could easily be expanded during capital controls. 
@_date: 2017-04-27 14:08:30
How is this the case? He can't 'lose' unless he goes with segwit. If he holds out, then BTC could be stuck in limbo for years/decades. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 06:12:49
Good for all assets, but it really is objectively criminal. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 08:30:10
I had this same thought. This squabble has cost bitcoin dearly. They better fork or whatever soon. Once there are articles everywhere on bitcoin agreeing to a new structure and able to handle future expansion, it will likely rise. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 10:52:40
Yeah. It's scary... Definitely needs a layer 2.
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:06:28
Isn't this a classic Strawman argument?  500mb blocks are obviously ridiculous.  Therefore any block size increase is a bad idea!

This is what you want. 
@_date: 2019-09-26 08:42:00
There are big penalties for doing this. But other than that, there really is nothing stopping you from transferring your money to any account and spending it as you like. Before you get busted up by the government.
@_date: 2018-07-12 03:29:41
Has this doubling of block size, doubled tx/s?
@_date: 2019-09-12 22:27:45
Yeah.. Every rate cut enables more debt dependent on this new rate to be serviceable. There is no going back.
@_date: 2017-05-06 09:40:05
Making a big outreach for a compromise would help though. if one side really is being overly stubborn, the community would see that and public opinion night shift. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:27:37
These are short term concerns. The silk-road auction will only need to sell ~44k bitcoins and with the recent surge in price, I'm sure people will be willing to pay a good price on this last auction. 
As for MMM, it is closed now and the price is still surging. Yyes it involves staggering sums of money, but only a fraction of that would need to be kept as bitcoin. Any effect would temporary and the price would bounce back IMO.
@_date: 2015-11-10 21:27:51
Is this why BTC crashed today? 
@_date: 2017-05-17 22:48:49
That's still very good. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:04:33

@_date: 2017-05-05 15:23:43
Is there a site with the distribution of fees among the unconfirmed transactions?

That would be great. Mature and forward looking. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:42:16
It's informal negotiations i assume. He's been quiet for a bit though. I hope there's some concrete update. Some verification by miners etc. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 06:33:35
What's odd is that Bitcoin surged since this became news. Someone bumped a whole bunch in the last hour but it's  going up again. The danger is that more countries follow suit now. It's definitely an easy target for authorities once bail-ins start happening in the next 5 years. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:24:35
Yep, We have a potential compromise, which would boost the price significantly. Yet there's still people who'd rather win 100% their way and risk hurting bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-22 03:03:54
Seriously... WTF is wrong with these people? So much hypocrisy and stubborness. It really reminds me of fundamentalist theists.  It's their way or rubble all while screaming hell fire / FUD. I'm so glad the ETC fork took them away from ETH... 
Thanks for the rare voice of reason. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 04:56:49

I really hope this works. 
We're reaching new ATHs in unconfirmed transactions. Let's not hit 300k

What would that mean for bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:21:50
Can you point me to a link where this is expanded upon?  
I don't see how segwit2mb centralises the coin. Or why people would be willing to ride it to death (bitcoin becoming an alt shitcoin).  This feels like American politics. Where no amount of destruction turns people away from Republican policies. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:58:14
Meh, some people will be more pissed off now.
1, they didn't get 100% their way, and 
2. The price is rallying proving their FUD wrong
Compromise is evil backroom deal centralized fascism am I right?
Can't we just be happy that we're moving past the bs debate?
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:06:50
I agree with you. However, at this point both sides should realise that without compromise, it's just gonna be 1MB no Segwit andmore of these bottlenecks + high tx fees. I'd take Segwit+BU over another year of this stalemate lol
@_date: 2017-05-06 10:44:18
Offer to be the mediator.
@_date: 2015-11-03 08:32:53
I don't know how it works exactly but I'm pretty sure government's can't make laws that suddenly turn everyone into a criminal retroactively. There's laws against such things. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:57:41
They don't care. They'd rather see bitcoin die than to compromise with the other side. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 09:01:14
In my experience, both sides are accusing the other of this. And since the statusquo right now is to do nothing, then both sides will destroy it together while blaming the other.  People just need to put pride aside, forget about past grudges and just negotiate anew. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:49:09
Other coins can manage hundreds of transactions per second. So why can't we move past 3?
In your example, that's like a phone manufacturer refusing to increase production capacity when a rival brand easily manages to output 100x his volume. 
We don't need to jump to 100 tomorrow.. but is 6 to 10 asking for too much?
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:57:03
How would a simple increase to 2mb be a flawed fork? It's not BU where a lot of bugs have existed and probably still do. 2mb is a much simpler change. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 04:22:59
I don't get why people are so entrenched with thinking the other side is bad. A segwit2mb compromise would be safe and likely widely accepted. 
We're at 160k unconfirmed txs. The choice is not BU or Segwit. It is compromise or 1mb forever.
Very likely to reach 200k unconfirmed by the end of the month. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:13:10
I agree but Fees have gotten too high and are rising fast. Not to mention complaints from users that didn't exist before. Best to widen the road a bit and allow more traffic

Thanks for the info and details. I do wonder why the core core devs didn't attend / agree though.  It seems that if they did, this would have been settled long ago. 
Instead we have a real danger of being surpassed, at least I'm market cap, very soon. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:35:14
He isn't dictator. I don't even like the guy but it seems like he was trying to find the common ground among the miners so that there could be an agreement. If they just so happen to agree with what he said initially then that's fine.
Like I said earlier,  would hope that it's Segwit now and a HF later if necessary.  Besides, if they commit to a hard fork later and there is never again any significant congestion then I doubt there would be one.
@_date: 2017-05-12 07:41:59
Just extrapolating the current trend 
@_date: 2015-11-03 06:54:41
On another note, how can they just make it illegal since I'm sure many people have bitcoins? Can they really just declare possibly millions of dollars of assets suddenly illegal to have?
There has to be some kind of legal challenge available to the thousands of people who have bitcoins. I look forward to seeing how this story develops. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:49:38
Correct me if I'm wrong, but PoS coins do pay their holders right?
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:13:20
I understand and agree with you fully. Personally I would prefer Segwit alone. However, the choice is no compromise or 1mb forever with all the consequences. Coin.dance shows a very robust stalemate. 
As for the alt-coin, I forgot which one but it was either Dash or XRP I think. Maybe planned but they definitely supported a lot more txs. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:08:52
Better mining chips wouldn't solve this though. Difficulty would adjust and nothing would change.
And this isn't about letting people have free transactions. I get that we need fees, but it's come to a point where demand is greatly outstripping supply and prices are too high. It's as if there was a shortage of power and instead of increasing production which we easily could, we let price get to the point where it costs $50 a day to keep the lights on and tell people to suck it up or pay the fee. 
The difference is here is taht we have another are where they do increase production to keep prices fair and while everyone laughs at this other area, it could very well attract people away from this one as prices keep climbing and frustrations are ignored / cited as a feature. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 03:18:22
Well let's put it up for a vote and see. Each side thinks the other doesn't want to compromise. SJust try. 
God-dam I wish I could invest" in an unconfirmed transactions index..
At this rate, next week is gonna be brutal. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:07:21
Terrifying. I don't even know if crypto can be hidden in such a crackdown.  They would likely find many people's crypto keys in safety deposit boxes. And they could also scour local bank and exchange data to reveal people's trading history. 
You could try resist but they could put your in prison until you comply. They could give crypto some stupid nickname like terror coins and you'd instantly be dehumanized. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:22:30
THe powers that be obviously don't believe it enough or else there'd already be a Segwit+2mb compromise. They need Bitcoin dom index to go to 40% or lower maybe. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 06:08:51
I was more concerned about the anonymity. Where someone would now know exactly who I am and how many certain coins I have.

I don't get it. Surely this situation right now is not ok. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 13:48:34
But if they have history of you buying bitcoin and sending it to private wallet, couldn't they hold you in contempt for not giving it up? 
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:26:33
Yes we need a new meeting and new agreement. If no side is willing to even reach out, then I'm inclined to believe both sides' FUD and both Core and BU want bitcoin to fail then. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:26:31
I hope the bitcoin obituary site contains some FUD articles how this compromise was gonna kill bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:36:28
Please educate me. Or point me to a link. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:44:37
If there was consensus then I would agree, go for it. It definitely seem preferable to me. But the fact is that there is a substantial, and currently larger voting group going the other way. As it stands neither is going to get their way and bitcoin keeps suffering. 
The option isn't Segwit or BU anymore. It is compromise or 1mb forever with all the consequences. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 05:21:51
Now that's comedy! 
@_date: 2017-05-06 12:27:24

I know this. on BTC markets the current price is around $3,700AUD
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:34:37
Yes i agree. I don't get why this compromise is such a big deal. We need both anyway. Too many people would rather bitcoin die than give an inch. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:03:45
The difficulty bomb will drastically slow inflation and vitalik likes the idea of capping it.  He even mentioned having effective negative issuance. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 00:51:05
He might be referring to txs no longer clearing up over the weekends. It means a constant uptrend in unconfirmed transaction. 230k, 300k in the next 2 weeks maybe.
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:25:52
You'll find that this is not enough for many people to consider a compromise. I wish i could by the unconfirmed transaction index. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:48:31
Sounds like Segwit alone might not be enough even today. Is there any reason why we aren't going for a Segwit+2mb for example?
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:09:19
As it stands, with the community divided, a compromise is the best way forward. We'll likely need a block size increase anyway with current adoption growth. So it may actually be avoiding a future change by doing it all in one.  
Having said that, i hope it's just segwit with a future block size increase based on some level if congestion. Like average fees over $1 with 300k unconfirmed transactions. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:41:16
Can you please expand on this.  I keep reading that core kept knocking back block size increases and finally agreed to segwit2mb at the round table. However then they only put forward code for segwit and now avoid the 2mb hard fork part. 
What is the truth?
@_date: 2017-07-16 03:35:44
This can't be the reason for people being against the compromise. How would it stop you anyway?
Anyway, isn't the point of the bitcoin system that otherpeople do the confirmations? If i was trading with you, i want a third party doing the transactions not you.
@_date: 2017-05-12 03:01:05
Why doesn't core/BU just compromise on a Segwit2mb solution? In the end, either solution is fine as you can do this or that 1st/2nd. 
But nah, let's hit new all time high unconfirmed transactions. Let's let fees go to $5. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:10:18
So is this considered a spam transaction that doesn't deserve to confirm? 
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:30:20
I hope its a segwit first and 2mb in the future if absolutely necessary. It definitely looks like it as that's what Barry started all of this with. 
That would be a compromise. However, I'll take segwit2mb HF since were' definitely gonna need a block-size increase anyway. To me it's a lot of fighting for what will be the same outcome. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:07:25
Are they intentionally trying to cause panic? 
Why no mention of 80% intent to activate a solution before then? Too many of these FUD announcements assume no segwit2x. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:49:26
Omg a scaling compromise! Shouldn't BTC be dead?
@_date: 2017-05-06 12:29:45

People have spread FUD everywhere that there a serious risk approaching and either only hinting or outright ignoring the pre August 1st plan with majority support.  
The price action is scary i must admit.  Everyday it's significantly lower and there are many days left before this is over. There might even be some collective effort to derail the whole thing. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 04:49:01
THis is FUD. They don't mention July 21st-23rd. Aug1 will be irrelevant if Segwit2x is activated beforehand.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:00:21
You've made a similar mistake to the articles you're criticizing. Segwit will not activate in August.  It will active before August so no danger of a split. Stop feeding the August 1st FUD.  The extremists lost the war but have won the battle to inflict deep wound on the price by spreading this FUD.  
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:17:51

@_date: 2017-05-06 07:32:50
So why do people get slammed all the time when they complain about long transaction times? Seems like there will always be those people. Even with 1000satoshi fees. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:54:06
With the current fees, BTC mining might still be more profitable though. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 07:19:47
Me too, but a solution doesn't look likely. For some reasons the two sides don't try and have a sit down and come to a compromise / agreement. 
I think Bitcoin's share, and most likely price would have to seriously go down before that happens. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 10:45:48
I would hope you're not wrong. But then if you're not then the fact there's a hold up is even scarier in a way... 
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:32:13
Then it should activate in the case taht this doesn't happen. But assuming the 2x part goes through, this is simply just playing with fire.
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:35:27
Thanks! I meant to write August. Man it would be great to have it all behind us by now haha.
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:01:34
I really don't understand why people prefer death over a benign compromise. 
Meanwhile, Ripple just hit half of bitcoin's market cap. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:52:50
I think the last point is important. First, people will see the miners keep their word.  Then segwit will activate and the sky won't fall.  If the price rises, many people will prefer not to rock the boat. 
Yet still, i know that nothing is good enough for the extremists. I doubt they'd have anything but a shitcoin though.  Let's face it, BTC isn't the fastest coin around. Why would someone practical go with a minority split over existing alts? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:30:05
But hard-line Christian like a creationist? Or Trump supporter? Otherwise we could discuss universal health care, trickle down economics or just plain why bad things happen. We'd have a similar debate on at least one of those.

@_date: 2017-05-21 22:46:52
A compromise that moves us forward is better than a one sided push that risks a fork just to ,ironically,  avoid a hard fork. We will definitely need to increase the block size between now and lightning. 2mb might not even be enough with lightning if bitcoin really takes off. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:46:02
Are there stats somewhere which show that this is happening? I'd really love to see as it would ease my mind. Although i don't know how to reconcile that when the high fees some people are experiencing.

There's a vocal minority that want this to fail and bitcoin to split. When this attack happened, I checked twitter for the segwit2x hashtag. 90% of posts were screaming about buggy rushed code, segwit fail, USAF etc.
It feels like a religious war lol
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:06:38
No one is discussing it and it's a bit worrying IMO. I was fully supportive of the agreement as a good compromise. This is a betrayal of that agreement. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:34:53
Yeah. Plus i notice gbminers and slush pool are still not showing intent to signal which might scare people as recent blocks are barely above 80%.What do they have to gain by trying to stop segwit2x? I hope it's just freaky natural variation.. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:02:17
It does matter as people Bitcoin perception would be damaged. Like its being decentralised among a bunch of bickering children, not adults. It will almost certainly be activated before August if &gt;80% for a few days. The alternative would be a possible halving of the price IMO which is why it won't happen. The adults are in charge.
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:47:18
They did recently say that they'll release the full code this weekend. However.. they are really pushing it now! Being late isn't a good look.
Pretty sure they'll release it soon and the signalling should start in time for the 21st but the price is gonna free fall faster and faster until the code is released. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:36:37
I think by the time this person moved their ETH to BTC, most of the gains had been locked in. Since then, BTC has gone just a little less. But if Segwit really does get confirmed officially, then BTC gains will probably be massive. 
Anyway, these EEA partners aren't gonna move thigns much. They are just names on a site. What drives real gains is concrete announcements, like when Ripple had their Japanese banks start testing it. The announcement will come though. That's for sure. There's a lot of development going. 
Damn, just as I was writing this BTC starting spiking like mofo. A damn sexy mofo. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:05:00
I don't get it. Are saying you don't trust miner's to validate your transactions?
@_date: 2017-07-14 10:08:09
The causes were a little different. people lost a lot of coins and faith in the currency. Of course, there's a danger of this repeating if people who didn't get 100% their way in the Segwit2x agreement keep trying to split bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:29:19

It's difficult to say. I am personally waiting for a country (some European one or Australia) to suffer a crisis and require bail-ins. If little old Cyprus pushed the price to over $1000, then I'm pretty sure a bigger one would push it even higher, likely above $2k. 
As for now, it's the Chinese pushing it up IMO as well as the news of it surging. Together, these factors could continue to push it up to ~$500 mark. However, apparently there isn't that big a demand from the wealthy for bitcoins in China as people think so if they begin to try store their money there at even a fraction of the way they go for international property investment, then a $1,000 would be easy.
The key however, is when to sell, / where it will pullback and stabilise. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 05:17:45
They are supposed to start signalling on July 21st as per the agreement. So they are waiting for that.
@_date: 2017-05-16 11:07:21
Despite the counter-points, many of which are valid, there's no denying taht bitcoin is clearly in danger of being surpassed by an altcoin, even in the next 12 months. 
But that's ok, it's all worth it as long as both sides take the moral high ground of refusing a compromise. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:48:48

I understand you more but can't really agree.  You make it sound like bitcoin is useless if a user can't have his own node.  What's the precedent here? If this was true, then bitcoin would be useless.
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:54:14
Hopefully this changes some people's minds about Bitmain being some evil backstabbing entitty. So many people think they would not honor the agreement. Some people don't even trust them to confirm their transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:37:51
Largely because it is finding new use cases while bitcoin can't compromise on segwit2mb. What is so bad about doing that?

I was about to ask since birth bitcoin subs are full of end-of-times posts about an agreement that no one knows about. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 07:12:07
No one was using bitcoin at the start either. Most thought it was a silly dad. But slowly and surely it became more widespread. There's nothing to stop ripple or other currencies doing the same thing.  
However, because bitcoin paved the way, adoption would be faster. And with people seeing what happened with bitcoin, they don't want to miss the growth again. Hence the surge in demand and price. 
People are kissing themselves if they think bitcoin is irreplaceable. If we don't compromise and scale, bitcoin could easily be surpassed in usage within 5 years. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:33:40
According to all the FUD I've read, wouldn't all miners support the 2mb hard fork? How would a viable hard fork happen if this was the case?

Because they've stolen people's coins before? I don't see why people think this agreement is so dangerous to bitcoin. We need both parts of it anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:58:06
The only bright side to these stories is we may have negative Bitcoin issuance as people lose their coins and keep effectively decreasing the supply. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:50:39
The problem is that we have extremists proclaiming they'd rather bitcoin die than have this compromise.  This scares people. It scares me at least. We've already had someone attack the testnet, who knows how else they will try to sabotage bitcoin because they didn't get 100% their way?

So then at what fee level would a doubling of the block-size be important enough to do before these other scaling solutions are ready? $50, $100? $200 fees?  
Or how many tx worth for one 4TB hard drive?
I know we need to scale but at some level, we need to use a short-term increase while we wait for those solutions to be ready. I'm curious what that level is.
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:35:57
You can always argue that no-one can define "enough" but no can define "too little" or "too much".
So then at what level would a doubling of the blocksize work for you personally? $50, $100? $200 fees?  
Or how many tx worth for one 4TB hard drive?
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:49:32
They scaled too fast and permanently..
I'm talking about a small increase. Or is the current size a grail that can never be changed even if fees crack $100 / ppl abandon the coin?
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:34:25
So you can't run your own node after Segwit2x activates?
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:07:23
I'm with you. However, if there is consensus, a hard fork is pretty safe. At this point, with alts catching up to bitcoin, it seems a lot more dangerous to do nothing. 
According to others, core lost a lot of trust by apparently stalling scaling options by agreeing to segwit2mb and then not following through. 
Something needs to give as both sides  are irreconcilable as it stands.
Whichever side i was on, at this point, I'd be willing to fold and go with the other side just to fix this. Surely that's better than waiting for 300k unconfirmed transactions. We might not get to 1m though before people seriously start using something else. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 02:05:05
Let's hope we don't have confirmation times measured in days and $50 transaction fees by then! 
@_date: 2017-07-14 07:41:30
I think it's because they agreed to a compromise and are willing to go through with it . However, if people sabotage this compromise and try to force their preferred way 100%, then the other side will do the same.
 It's simply hedging a bet in the face of a very toxic minority who is unwilling to compromise.
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:15:25
I don't hold or care too much about other coins. But 4tb hard drives are around $100 now.
At what metric does it not make sense to increase the block size a little? People talk about running their own nodes but if fees rise to where even 10txs costs more than a 4tb drive then what's the hold up?
4tb could store the chain 16 times over.
@_date: 2019-05-01 14:58:58
Is there a video of this?
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:22:11
It's true. But what if the equilibrium means that a 51% attack becomes really cheap? LN, if it works, could take a lot of txs off chain after all.
I hope it all works out of course. 1mb blocks might be a key. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:22:37
The FUD about losing your coins in August is working. Uninformed investors have not being told about Segwit2x and 85% support. The mainstream articles have followed this FUD and so people are selling at any price days before the resolution.

If you look at some of the non-crypto positions someone like luke-dashjr holds, you would see that it is basically like a religion with block-size increases being a primal sin. If you look at it from this POV, you can understand why no argument works. Many would rather see bitcoin reach $100 fees and die than raise the blocksize.
Although this is just one part of the team. If fees did reach $50-$100 again, we could easily see a situation where most people and miners choose to scale and then the unscaled BTC becomes the alt and a doubled-blocksize fork wins the BTC ticker.
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:04:00
You won't convince the extremists.  They know that a split is likely to kill bitcoin.  But there are people in this world that would rather burn a system down than not get 100% their way. The other side is literally Satan to them.
You'd think Jihan was some evil monster reading the conspiracy theories. And you'd think that somehow getting the 2x upgrade will give the government backdoor access to the system. 
This is like US politics and i bet most of the people acting like children are republicans who also believe in death panels and destruction of the nation by socialism if we implemented certain policies that have worked much better for a long time everywhere else. They can't be reasoned with and unfortunately, they are enabled on this sub.

There'd still be many nodes. You can't seriously think thousands of nodes /miners would conspire to steal your transaction.  Doing so would make the coin useless.  Tell me it would make sense to do so.

Yep, he doesn't understand that he keeps painting targets on himself. Now imagine he proves he owns billions and starts going around destroying the crypto space through patent trolling. There would have to be at least one crazy dangerous individual who suffers a massive loss because of this and goes after him. The community itself would go apeshit if they see projects blackmailed to switch to SV or face lawsuits.

If they had power they'd be spamming this subreddit with declarations of victory. But nothing... just little nodes. Seems almost all of them prefer bitcoin destruction over any compromise and such people would naturally be a minority.

They intentionally disrupted testing and then people falsely claimed that the code was buggy. That's a very political attack IMO.

That's fine but those are issues with really large blocks like 32mb. Not a small increase like we're talking here.
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:59:58
Only caveat is if rewards run out and fees aren't high enough to secure the network. Could very well require some low level of rewards beyond 21m.

But I'm not saying we go to 32mb or something like that. Btc is like 200gb after all these years. 
If we increased the size slightly like 2x or 4x, we wouldn't reach 4tb for many years. And by then storage would be super cheap and you could likely get 64tb for $100. Plenty of room to figure out scaling.. It would also knock the wind out of competitors.

Didn't know it was going to be public info. Thanks.

It better hurry up.  And i mean like within 12 months. Ideally 6.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:28:31
I find it hard to believe the average is still 10m. Feels closer to 20.
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:52:10
Only need to convince a majority. And if fees do cross 50 again, pretty sure ppl will rather increase block size than watch ppl decide btc has no future and go elsewhere. Which do we really prefer if it gets to that?
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:21:04
A 4tb drive costs $100 and can store the current chain 16x over. A slight increase would not push anyone out of their own nodes. But if fees climb to $40 or so then this becomes seriously ridiculous.
If we reach a point where 2txs can pay for a 4tb hard drive what then?

Considering many people on both sides prefer bitcoin dies than to compromise.. it could go down to the low 1000s before people realise that is a silly position to take.
