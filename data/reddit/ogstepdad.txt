Love how triggered people are. This is about btc and the title of the man who mentioned it. Take your angst and anger to political subs.
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:23:54
Yeah you're right I guess it'd be more.....just digital everything (sorry for lack of better term). I agree completely now that you bring that up, they should be in support of everything being digital. Not btc, that's just short sighted of me.
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:14:26
I've been thinking about this recently. Tell me why I'm dumb....shouldn't the gov be in full support of btc? They'd have control over everyone's wallet or account if they want to. If there was a universal app, paper money was all gone, it'd be as simple as seizing an account to render a person useless. It'd be a cool cycle if they brought in btc, bought back and hoarded the gold again then reintroduce a gold backed currency. Over hundreds of years I'm talking.

It's good exposure for noobs def. This page is cult-like. It's bad memes, there's not many actual developers here. It's just the doomsday type people.
@_date: 2019-11-04 23:35:05
The people on this sub generally seem like they know what they're talking about, but have close to zero concept of reality. I hold btc but also use robinhood for trading, not to hold. It has its place in the market. I believe in bitcoins protocol and potential to be used by big corporations to safely, and cheaply process payments . I'm not into the people on here thinking we'll ruin the banking system lolol
@_date: 2019-11-05 04:36:58
Where's this angsty anger coming from my guy? Is everything okay at home?
@_date: 2019-11-22 00:59:55
This meme is so cringe and posts like this are what's wrong with this sub.
@_date: 2019-11-04 23:18:02
Imagine being so mad someone decided to use robinhood. If it's not your money, who cares
@_date: 2019-08-01 22:15:04
Trump def buys puts before he tweets. Imagine being that much of a boss .
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:46:29
Computers more important than btc rn. I don't understand why you need that model though. Get one that WORKS not the same one everyone around you has. Throw the extra you would have spent at Bitcoin but realize. This isn't a get rich quick thing. Save it there and add to it when you can . (Even a dollar). This wont help you pay off school right away. Understand this could be a complete gamble.
@_date: 2019-08-22 15:30:30
you are kinda right but to some of us developers and miners who are in it for the tech and advancement, this is a hobby.
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:30:46
Us Santander here. No problems as of today. Hope it's not on it's way :/
@_date: 2019-08-23 02:47:07
@_date: 2019-08-25 17:18:34
This is why we need the normiememes and money hungry people to slightly tone down their posts. We need to make a sub that developers communicate on so people know of the possibilities.

"You can try out Ivy using the Ivy Playground for Bitcoin, which allows you to create test contracts and try spending them, all in a sandboxed environment"
Should have added this in my original comment. Good luck man, the smart contracts seriously resparked my passion for programming and just cs in general.
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:42:06
Me too I put the smaller amount in at 9.7 and now I'm curious if I should just buy, or if we're on our way further down
@_date: 2019-08-22 17:19:45
Agreed maybe a new GPU or something not just directly Bitcoin lol good point.
@_date: 2019-10-07 02:26:17
Omg you're amazing!!!!!!
@_date: 2019-08-07 17:23:23
Thanks! I love these communities. I got obsessed with money and finance this summer in a tunnel visioned way that made me forget about my other passions. Crypto reignited the love I had for programming and computers. After buying btc I went and wrote my first smart contract for ethereum and now I plan to hopefully start making some Bitcoin contributions on GitHub. I friggin love it!
@_date: 2019-10-07 02:33:36
The thought counts more than anything :)
@_date: 2019-08-25 17:04:34
Omg great job dude! I wish developers of all forms were praised here as much as the ethereum crowd. You obviously worked your ass of for this and it shows. Great job. I even hit it on mobile...not bad.

Noob here. Started about 6 months ago. I'm 25 and started thinking (worrying) about my future and how I waste money on things to "cope" with the day like energy drinks and smokes. Also want to provide for my current gf when I propose one day. Anyways, bought in at 12.3ish. I'm a cs student so after looking into it and learning more,  I fell in love and bought a big deal more. I didn't care the cost at that point, but luckily it was like 9.6k. were here, and we're in the green. Thanks for having us!
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:53:52
Yep. I refuse to miss out on bitcoin going on sale anymore. I always regret it about a month or two later
@_date: 2019-08-18 02:05:50
Building on Bitcoins distributed contracts and giving them new conditions. You can use ivy and balzac.  RSK had a pretty cool idea with side chaining too. Requiring multiple signatures for a transaction, time locks ect. I'm unsure if you were trying to be a dick or not. If not I'll go into more detail with you if you're interested.
@_date: 2019-08-01 22:42:40
10% btc atm but try to funnel 3$ a day into it so that may rise soon.
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:06:23
Honestly since i got into smart contracts and down to the nitty gritty of what all this is......ill take any loss. This is seriously beautiful and has wild potential. ill keep buying the idea until it ceases to exist.
@_date: 2019-08-09 02:46:01
You have years and years of expirience on me I'm just a noob Cs student, but a few days ago I developed my first smart contract and I think that's what you're looking for maybe? It was so cool to see and make. I was super proud of myself after  (made me invest alot more in crypto too). If that's not what you're looking for, I'm sorry. If so, I'd love to see how you develop yours.
@_date: 2019-08-18 01:38:38
This is kinda silly to me. Just recently I got into smart contracts and wrote one for ethereum and Bitcoin. (test contracts of course.) Yeah most alt coins are shit but I really do like ethereums protocol and see the importance and potential in it. All my money is in btc, but brushing away anything else is close minded and really hurts progress and innovation.
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:43:46
Just bought at 9.7 but saving a few other portions in case it dips lower.
@_date: 2019-10-24 23:27:52
I'm sorry if I'm wrong but what do you mean it can't be confiscated? There's many, many instances of it being confiscated.
@_date: 2019-08-23 04:06:45
Yeah that didnt make sense.
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:50:32
He prob lives with parents so this isn't a worry of his. Not hating, just the only logical explanation icould think of
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:23:50
Rofl I am so sorry if this was before the drop.
@_date: 2019-10-07 01:57:08
It's about blockchain...which isnt Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a crypto currency. This is about processing data on a safe and fully transparent infrastructure. This "bullshit" will eventually save corporations millions of dollars when they realize they dont need to go through Banks to safely process transactions. You have Bitcoin in your name, yet dont seem to know much about how it works.

I think you maybe thinking of multisig? They have them and a few devs are working on distributed contracts to make it even safer.
"Multisignature (multisig) refers to requiring more than one key to authorize a Bitcoin transaction. It is generally used to divide up responsibility for possession of bitcoins.
"Standard transactions on the Bitcoin network could be called “single-signature transactions,” because transfers require only one signature — from the owner of the private key associated with the Bitcoin address. However, the Bitcoin network supports much more complicated transactions that require the signatures of multiple people before the funds can be transferred"
I wish more devs were active here like they are in other communities.
@_date: 2019-08-25 17:17:49
I was thinking maybe multi signature wallet may be what he had in mind?

Dude just stop. People like you make us look like we're all insane and off our meds. This should be a place for developers and enthusiasts not people who wanna be overnight millionaires and conspiracy nuts like this. This type of bullshit absolutely hurts our image.

Lol these rap mf don't know shit. Good on akon for this, but he brought it around the most ignorant people

@_date: 2019-09-12 04:47:03
I'm also wondering where the devs and other people who want to actually talk about btc are at too man.
@_date: 2019-09-09 17:42:37
The trAfficked children are actually stored as prisoners in the blockchain

We need to make a lotion/essential oil company that takes only Bitcoin. Watch the Karen's buy coin en masse
@_date: 2019-09-10 20:53:54
Oh lol you're the type that legit craves validation. You are right vertigo, them refusing to listen or understand what Bitcoin totally isn't ignorant.
Maybe if they were more respectful of akon and what he was saying.
@_date: 2019-09-10 20:39:31
Nope. The ignorant part is them basically refusing to understand what akon is saying calling a scam and such. I see you just want to be right though so, you are right. I hope that fulfils you for today.
