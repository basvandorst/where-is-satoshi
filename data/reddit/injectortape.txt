I came here to find this guy on his way down. We're almost ready for the horizontal guy again, then back to vertical up. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 21:51:53
Done. Good luck!

As I read this now, I read the exact same exchange go down in bitcoinmarkets. I'm talking word for word, this looks like a scam.

I'm in the same boat. The reality is our investments at this point will never be as good as those who waited or those who bought in the early days but I don't regret buying in at all. Hindsight will always be 20/20 my friend, don't torture yourself with it!

Not if each piece performs it's own function or part of a function that serves the whole

They're at 953 on quadriga out of Canada right now.

Scam

Oh this is epic in so many ways, I would LOVE to see it but sadly it's not in the cards. Hopefully you keep us updated on the bet as well as the success of the mining operation and greenhouse though.

Unless you didn't invest more than you could afford to lose and are not expecting to get rich in six weeks and still hope it becomes a world currency.

I personally am new here, I started buying in a few days ago and have been perusing all the crypto related subs. The memes yesterday really put me at ease when I woke up and my investment was down 20%, I plan to hodl on.

I didn't say people who bought a year ago made a bad investment, I didn't say anyone made a bad investment. I didn't comment on the attention people pay to it and I didn't comment on how useful it is. 
You took one phrase I used and extrapolated on a bunch of things I didn't say...
@_date: 2017-01-12 07:27:58
This is the best. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:39:55
Quadriga seems to have consistently high prices

Newbie here, what the hell are buy and sell signals?

 1000 btc? Is it in escrow or are you taking them at their word?

I'm pretty new to bitcoin and not specifically knowledgable in any part of it, but after reading this I wonder if there would be any correlation between adoption of bitcoin and adoption of PayPal back in the day?
There was obviously some skepticism about sending money via third party across the internet but we've basically conquered that and PayPal is a go to service. Maybe someone with the applicable knowledge and expertise can confirm this or tear the parallels to shreds.

Guys you can actually see me waving if you zoom in.
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:39:33
Good call I agree 
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:28:11
Did you get confirmation? 
Fuuuuck I definitely sent bitcoin to that address. These are expensive lessons. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:30:50
I have half a mind to go down just to see a million dollar bet in person, not to mention the produce.
Kudos. That is amazing. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:29:20
Definitely! I don't know how much privacy you're willing to give up but maybe you could get it covered on the news too. A million dollar bet has to be newsworthy. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 22:16:06
That's good advice, thanks. I was more or less joking although I did buy in at probably the highest it's ever been, right before that massive drop from 1100. I don't regret it though I'm just happy to be in the game! 
@_date: 2017-01-12 19:48:49
Give it to 'er, I did.
@_date: 2017-01-07 17:48:01
Yes, I bought my first ever bitcoin at this price, three of them. 
@_date: 2017-01-15 07:41:15
Fair enough. I'm just hoping for a grander scale of that this time. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 19:37:05
Well what did I do to piss off the universe I wonder..
