LN will be used to route BTC inside and outside the exchange. The exchange will still require you to identify and validate your ID and upload all the stats about you and can provide the trade volume to the government. no matter if you use LN or normal blockchain to send the money to your private wallet

Yes it's just a tether transaction. Tether uses bitcoin blockchain and ethereum for its opearation. So each tether transfer is helpful to the bitcoin ecosystem since they have to pay fees in bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-01 08:54:51


There is no CEO for bitcoin incorporation :p It's a decentralized network. 
The exchanges need to implement lightning and segwit in order to reduce the load on the network. It's self-motivating to do so, because if other exchanges do it first they will have less fees on their withdrawals. 
So the one who don't implement will be out of the competition

A tether on an exchange is a combination of:
1- Trusting US government not to print US out of thin air
2- Trusting tether not to print tether out of thin air, or print funds not covered in US 
3- Trusting bitcoin that it will keep working, since tether is using bitcoin blockchain as a backend of data transfer
4- Trusting the exchange not to steal the funds/ tether
Worst combination ever.
Best thing to have your own bitcoin keys and that's it. Trust no one, verify!

Just consider the immutablity aspect of Bitcoin. You need to pay in Bitcoin, to write to its blockchain. (Like what tether is doing). That's enough should give you use case for bitcoin...
Consider all applications that need transparency. They need to commit their data hash to an immutable blockchain. And pay in bitcoin

Man do the basic math, a block can fit max 2000 transaction. you have 7 billion people. Unless you go off-chain scalability (3 layers) you won't be able to serve all people and all their transactions on main-chain. You need not only layer 2 scalability but layer 3. Search for lightning channel factory.

Because: a big part of blockchain security comes from decentralization.  The more "independent" nodes you have, the more decentralized it will be and the highest its value.
I stress on independent. It means managed by many different people with different interest. Not like ripple where all nodes belong to the same company or same government etc.  
Bitcoin being the first and mostly deployed and used blockchain has the highest value now :)

In reality, 2-3 whales will have 99% BTC and the rest will have much much much less than the avg. I am more curious about the median than the average. For extremistan domain, read Nassim Taleb Black swan book :)
@_date: 2019-06-15 06:51:15
Not really, here is a basic calculation for you sir: 
Bitcoin daily volume is: [$20,190,880,261](  
Bitcoin price is: [$8,689.68](
It means there are around 2,323,547 being traded every day. 
The halfening will reduce bitcoin supply from 12.5 btc to 6.25 btc/block.
That means a reduction of 6.25\*6\*24 = 900 btc/day assuming 1 block every 10 minutes or 6 per hour. 
Meaning that the halfening will reduce the daily market injection of 900 / 2 million being traded = that's 0.045% ratio, not a lot of liquidity drop. We're not in early days anymore where the newly injected bitcoin represent a lot of market liquidity.
@_date: 2019-06-17 11:03:06

@_date: 2019-06-27 11:17:33

@_date: 2019-10-29 13:55:37
By the number of leading zeros in the hash of the block. 
A hash should be random number. You have 50% to get 0 and 50% to get 1. 
If you have 2 leading zeros (00) =&gt; it means in average you tried 4 times. 
If you have 3 leading zeros (000) =&gt; it means in average you tried 8 times. 
If you have 4 leading zeros (0000) =&gt; it means in average you tried 16 times. 
If you have N leading zeros (000...0) =&gt; it means in average you tried 2\^N times.
As simple as that.
@_date: 2019-02-11 13:28:15

@_date: 2019-02-23 18:03:40
I can explain the re-target formula, but I never heard of the off-by-one bug before. Here how bitcoin works: 
\- In order to understand mining, you need to understand hashing function first. Overall, you can consider it as something difficult to crack, so you just need to try random numbers. SInce it's pure random, you have 50% chance the first bit to be 0 and 50% to be 1.  Think of it like a coin flip. Now in order to get two starting 0, it's harder. It's 1/4 chance. Since you have these 4 possibilities (00,01,10,11 and only 1/4 is 00). So each additional leading zero to find makes the difficulty 2 times harder. Each leading zero less, makes it 2 times easier
\- More leading zeros in the hash is hard to find. It follows power of 2 law. N leading zeros means a probability of 1/ (power(2,N) to find. 1 leading zero -&gt; 50%, 2 leading zeros 25%, etc 
\- The more the network is hashing (if more miners join), the more it's easy to find leading zeros in the hash. So in order to keep the blockchain only generating one block every 10 minutes, we need to adapt the hashing power of the network and more leading zeros have to be added. 
\- Now since there is no central authority to decide how many leading zeros you need for the next block to be valid, it's added as rule of the consensus algorithm. Every 2016 blocks, all the network nodes check independently of each others how much time did it take to mine the last 2016 blocks, if the average is more than 10 minutes you need to reduce the difficulty, if the average time is less than 10 minutes you need to increase the difficulty, if average is 10 minutes, you keep the same target. 
Example: 
\- Network is finding 35 leading zeros in the hash, the average of the last 2016 blocks is 5 minutes. Everyone can deduce that the next block has to have 36 leading zeros so to find a block in 10 minutes. 
\- Network is finding 35 leading zeros in the hash, but the average block time is 20 minutes -&gt; everyone in a decentralized way deduce you need to reduce the difficulty to 34 leading zeros.

According to Bitcoin calculation and current hash rate, you mine around 5 btc per year. So if you go fully solo you might need to wait 3 years in average before finding a block (if the current hash rate doesn't increase). That's why better joining a pool. 
Unless you buy like 50 miners. Then you can hv your own pool.

It's useful if you want to do many of such nanopaiement where you promise probability and you settle probabilities by hashing a random number and each betting on the outcome.

Do you sell bitcoin for cash when you want to spend? 
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:57:39
For sure it poses huge logistic challenge that goes beyond the 1 billion$ price of equipment to distribute the miners worldwide, and the cost of electricity and management to run them etc. 
But in theory, a 51% attack can be done and it will create a massive distrust on the network for I would say 5 billion $. 
Now if you have 5 billion $, you could attack the network by buying slowly over a long period of time, and then putting a large order of sale in one shot... that can spark the fear of all uncertain and weak hearted investors. 
Don't get me wrong, i am a big fan of blockchain and bitcoin, I am just trying to assess objectively the security value of the network in its current state :) 
@_date: 2018-02-16 06:37:26

@_date: 2017-09-01 22:38:17
Yes, but since it's a digital currency, you don't need to physically move to propagate the order on several markets. It can even be programmed :) Anyway, my point from this post is that the real security of bitcoin, is not the underlying cryptoprotocol, rather than the amount of money needed to break it, and for me it's around 1-5 billion $ (either in hashing power or a whale attack)

LOL yes I just saw this shitty article :D
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:46:16
By the famous 51% attack :) they can break the immutability of past block and convince anyone in the network that their version of truth is the correct one, since by definition, you trust the highest hashing difficulty (leading zeros). 
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:41:48
Or you could create a GigaFactory of Antminers à la Elon Musk ^_^ thus you can produce the million antminer even cheaper :).
BTW wondering why Antminer sell their miners rather than running bitcoin with them :D. If i can create a money printing machine, i would print money with them, rather than sell the machine for money :p 
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:50:54
I totally backup this :) 
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:00:44
Yes my first estimate on the real economical security of the bitcoin network is around: 1-5 billion $ in term either of computer hardware to get a 51% attack, or banks buying over long period of time slowly and then creating a massive sale order in one shot. These for me are the current weakest point (obviously wouldn't think in breaking sha256 ;) )
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:09:31

1- In general a bunch of arithmetic and Boolean operations.
2- That can't be easily inverted, with an avalanche effect.
3- Same input will always leed to same hash.
4- Change 1 bit of input and statistically 50% of the output will change.
5- The rest is just boring technical details
6- No black magic or rocket science inside
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:50:19
There is already 
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:52:04
Another argument: the security of anything is linked to its weakest point. Anyone with a billion $ to spare, can buy slowly bitcoins and then massively sell them (in one shot creating an avalanche effect).
Since it's unregulated, he/she can create a shockwave similar to the "whale attack" on seals: 
Basically slowly gathering, then creating a massive sale. 
So for me the security of bitcoin network is around 1-5 billion $. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:56:58

Same as most of .com websites in the .com bubble era. Only goodcoins will survive a bear market. Shitcoins will die. Evolution theory 101

Because 1- Mining is heavily industrialized, in would have been better if mining was just done on normal computers and each person having only one running 
2- These poor economies forbid crypto-exchanges, so it is hard to get in and out of the market 
3- Crypto is too volatile
4- Technical problems of scalability of crypto that needs to be solved. Tx fees are too expensive.
