Actually, there was an small group of hackers that by many different means (not just an iCloud exploit) collected the pictures over 5-6 years. Somebody decided to dump their collection and everyone else went along with it.

I'm pretty sure you need to be alive to claim the den as your own.
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:31:31
Fair enough. I woke up too early and didn't have my coffee when I posted that.

And they said the the big-bad three letter agencies could not access your fingerprint. That's pretty much confirmed bullshit.

Coinbase instant buy/verification.
You could try Circle, but they locked my account because my bank account wouldn't link and I tried too many times, I would not recommend them to anybody.

I guess that it has something to do with the fact that the people I know (including myself) who are in the tech field are very security and privacy minded. And yeah, different groups of people across the world will have different opinions.

It's just default FlatUI, from the looks....

This is a good read: 
By installing a rom that allows you to do advanced sandboxing and permisons, it's not that big of an issue.

Oh, haha, my bad.

I'd say that Apple can help certain three letter agencies a lot more than Google can, just because iOS is proprietary code and Android is not.


99% of people who I know that have iPhones are people who don't give a flying fuck about phone specs, security or privacy. They just want to use snapchat and facebook.

let me rephrase:
as secure as hardened android
@_date: 2014-06-03 11:33:05
Everyone I know who is tech savvy(syadmins, senior developers), all use Android. I guess it's just the group of people I hang out with.

@_date: 2014-06-03 16:36:07
Ah, I was unaware of that, and now thinking about it, it does make sense.
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:12:54
Meh, I don't like iOS devices for a number of reasons. Too "nerfed" imo. Plus the fact that iOS is proprietary code and is almost impossible to harden to be as secure as Android does make it far less appealing to me.

What would stop the attackers from running a JS script to read the forms before they were sent (assuming the had server access)?
@_date: 2015-03-25 01:20:42
Yes, those are industry required for handling cards, and no amount of SSL will protect the client from another script from reading the DOM tree, though.
So it was possible that if attackets had access to Twitch's webserver (or database, if the output was not sanitized: an xss attack), they could in fact have stolen the cards or other financial information. 
To be clear this is not a flaw in your service specifically, but more the entire http(s) protocol.

The cards numbers are reused. Paypal blocks them once too many people try to checkout with them. Unless they changed something since the MaskMe migration.
