Great life advice! Another way to look at this: Would millions of dollars landing in your lap right now make you happy? OF COURSE. Would you still be happy 15 years from that point? Not as easy to say.

No, when you receive "clean" coins, it'll usually be like 3 or so transactions in various amounts. If you tumble like 5 BTC, it might be split into more. 
In the end, if someone were to trace the BTC you received from the tumble, it would just trace to one address after another that is not tied to anything. If someone tried tracking the BTC you sent initially through the tumbler, he/she would just see that your BTC got split and would be unable to figure out what happened to it after that.

Ah, you've *kinda* identified a slight flaw in the system. This problem is tackled by slowly distributing your coins to you through a set time (anywhere from 6 hours to days if you choose.) 
Also, if you use a local wallet (not online shit like blockchain.info which is very insecure), you can have a bunch of addresses under your one "wallet." So, that would make it even harder to trace to one address. 
*Edit: Forgot to include this: Tumblers like BitcoinFog take random fees of 1-3% from the BTC you send it. So the amount you sent in is never the amount you receive. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 10:14:42
But what "original address?" If someone kept going through the blockchain, address by address, he/she would see just addresses being split more and more. There is no point in the chain where you can look at it and determine "aha,  here is where he put the coins initially!"
Don't think of this as you receiving clean versions of the original BTC you deposited. It's more like you handing someone cash, that person splits it up and hands it to even more people, who split it up and hand it out even more. Then, on completely separate and different occasions random strangers walk up to you and hand you a dollar here, 25 cents here, etc. until you have the original amount you had earlier. The money is completely separate. 
*Edit: it's also important to remember that a bitcoin address does not identify who owns the wallet. So, you can't just look at a bitcoin address and know it's a tumbling service. Someone would have to know the thousands of addresses a tumbling service uses in order to even make an attempt at figuring out what's going on.

I completely understand where you're coming from and what you're trying to say. That aside, I'm not arguing over what is "right/wrong."
I'm simply stating that the law was broken.
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:30:06
*sigh*. Coinbase cannot look at the address you send your BTC to tumble and identify what that address is for. It's not like the address says "tumbler." Most of the time, the address you first send coins to is brand new, then it gets all jumbled up later. 
Been doing it since Coinbase was created... 
@_date: 2014-12-24 04:04:52
Whether or not someone is charged does not determine whether he/she broke the law... Wikileaks technically breaks US law, which PayPal is obligated to follow, so PayPal does not serve Wikileaks. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 06:25:52
This shows that Coinbase is keeping a close watch on what you do with your BTC, which defeats the whole purpose of a decentralized network.

Eh... virtually impossible with Bitcoin tumbling on Tor though. If you want to hide where your coins go, it is very possible.
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:35:17
Okay I'm done explaining this. It's probably best that you try it yourself to get an idea of what you're talking about. 
Your idea of how tumbling works is not how it works. It's not like every address within the system is actually owned by someone. You understand that you can generate thousands of new BTC addresses? 
@_date: 2014-12-24 08:28:47
**This is probably going to be buried, but anyone interested in hiding their coins should read this:**
It is a common misconception that since your bitcoins are tracked throughout the blockchain (public transactions), you are always able to be traced.
If you want to hide your coins **USE A BITCOIN TUMBLER** (e.g. [Bitcoin Fog]( Your coins will be split up into random amounts, randomly distributed among different addresses, then randomly sent from random wallets to an address of your choosing.

I don't have to read anything to know that accessing classified government documents, releasing them to the public, and trying to evade US and international authorities is not legal... 
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:41:48
Yea your idea of how this works is very wrong. This is the easiest way to explain it without detail:
You give Bob $5. Betsy walks up to you and hands you a different $5. Betsy is not a real person. Bob is not a real person. Your money is clean. Done. You aren't receiving the same money at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:28:05
Let's say you moved the coins at one point in time through an exchange. That exchange can now connect an identity with that address. Theoretically, you could follow that address as it spends and we would know it was you spending those coins. Now, on what? Not sure. Takes a lot but yes, people could figure it out if you're not safe.

It is off the table because any time you post about it here, it is removed. You can't mentioned it without being removed and subsequently banned. Take a good hard look and decide for yourself if this sub is being strong armed.

Why are you copy/pasting this word for word from my post in a different sub?
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:05:53
There is a reason Bitfinex pulled out of the US.
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:26:05
US is going to sleep and the East is waking up? The difference is really small in the grand scheme of things. I expect much bigger fluctuations at higher values.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:53:46
Ugh. Dude. You literally said BS. Got called out for it. Then you doubled down and tried to derail the whole argument because you can't get over your ego. It goes to the point where you just throw out insults. You must be one of those people that don't know when to shut up.

If you're talking about switching between cryptocurrencies, you can use something like: 
Note that you can only do relatively "small" amounts per transfer. But depends on what you view as small.
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:37:01
Once people realize USDT is worthless, you couldn't trade it for a popsicle stick. Suddenly, all of that flow from USDT into BTC becomes worthless. That worthlessness will trigger a crash.

How do you see how much BTC is left?
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:36:18
You can sell on Mtgox then wire transfer to your bank if you want to cash out at a volatile high price 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:19:05
I agree. This is exactly what happened last time it crashed. It crashes then goes into this rapid up and down phase. Next thing you know, it just goes into a free fall!
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:32:53
Paper wallets are not meant for easy-access. You should only do it if you want to save your BTC offline, locked in a safe for long periods of time.
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:46:57
Did this just happen.

It's bouncing alright.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:42:16
If you are looking to trade quickly, you go with Mtgox for sure. If you're just looking to buy some BTC and hold-out, use Coinbase.
Coinbase does not fluctuate as rapidly as Mtgox because it handles a much smaller volume.
My advice as someone who bought BTC when it was one dollar.. just hold onto it and ignore all this bullshit. It will always go up eventually.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:22:44
I use Coinbase to get USD into/out of the system. I use MtGox to trade quickly during stuff like what's happening right now.

Keeping a wallet on your phone may not have been the safest place. Phones are really not that secure. It's better to just use blockchain.info and access it through the browser in your phone if needed.
Also, Google Authenticator.
