Why are these 50 BTC mining reward in genesis block not spendable?  If that address controls that output then they can spend it. What am I missing?

Some people argue that today's inflation is in the stock market as seen by the insane valuations of tech sector stocks.

I think to crack a bitcoin private key from a Bitcoin address is using a quantum computer is like cracking 128 encryption using non-quantum computer which is almost impossible.
Also, you are assuming that a public key of an address is known, if you don't reuse an address than the public key for the address you hold your bitcoin in will never have its public key exposed.

Yes that's true, but until 2040 the capacity of blocks could increase to accommodate more transactions, so we could have a situation where individual transactions pay less fees than even today's fees, but the total transactions fees could be higher.

There are two different words here, key and address which are not the same. When you generate a new address, what you are actually generating is a new public key and then double hash that public key to get your bitcoin address, so bitcoinAddress=doubleHash(publicKey). From this formula it is obvious that it is quite impossible to guess the public key just by knowing the bitcoin address.
You don't use your public key for transacting, you use instead your bitcoin address. When someone send you UTXO to your bitcoin address they have no idea what the public key for that address is. The only way to expose the public key of an address is by using that address to send a transaction, once you do that, everyone knows the public key for that address.

I'm not sure I agree about your last statement and the inevitability of QC. The media reporting on QC is one thing but reality is another. For a small number of Qbits it is possible to create a QC, however, as you try to increase the number of Qbits the correctness of the QC get reduced dramatically, so the more you increase Qbits the more the whole thing become less stable, which will require you to add more Qbits just to check for errors. 
I'm no expert either, but I think it is quite hard to create a QC with enough Qbits that it will be capable of doing anything meaningful.
A lot of time also when a company report that they produced a quantum computer with a certain number of Qbits, other scientists may disagree with the claim that it is a quantum computer because sometimes they are not even sure if the computer they have is even quantum. This is what have been said about D-wave, some claimed that their computer is not even quantum.
Implementing a quantum resistant algorithm in Bitcoin is quite expensive as it takes a lot of space more than the current one, so before any change is done, we need to be sure that creation of quantum computer capable of cracking Bitcoin is viable first, otherwise, why make Bitcoin more inefficient to protect against something that is not even real.

I don't like two things about Ethereum. One is the hard fork that was the end of the Ethereum moto "Code is Law" and the second is a complain similar to the comment you have replied to in that Bitcoin full node is so much easier to run than Ethereum node.
With that said, Ethereum is way better than any other smart-contract blockchain out there like centralized shitcoins EOS, Tronx, NEO etc.

I thought in English to change a noun from singular to plural you just add an s or es at the end of the word. So why is the plural of this particular word Winklevoss is Winklevii and not Windlevosses?

I'm not sure what you are talking about. The whole selling point of Apple products is the software not the hardware. Just take any iPhone and compare it to its competitors and you'll see that it has inferior hardware but when it comes to performance, it fares better.

because it suffers from multiple problems that are unsolved. Long range attack, low subjectivity etc. maybe that's a compromise that Ethereum need to take to succeed but its different for Bitcoin as its whole premise is about its superior security.

To gain efficiency, Bitmain need to keep shrinking the chip size, they currently have 7nm chips, which means it is extremely hard to shrink the size even more as you are dealing with individual atoms at this level. For example, Intel and AMD rarely shrink their manufacturing process as it becomes harder and yield is lower, most of their performance comes from adding more cores and adding some hardware features that can do specific work efficiently, this can't be done for ASICS because they already focused on one function and that is calculating sha256.
 I'm not sure what will happen when we reach a point where they can't optimize their hardware anymore and multiple companies can produce hardware with relatively the same efficiency, if that happens, centralization of mining hardware will no longer be a problem and the hardware itself will be extremely cheap, so the only cost for miners will be the cost of energy.

Decentralized crypto projects shouldn't fear Libra. I think this will make the whole ecosystem more healthier as it will separate the centralized from the decentralized. 
People will have a choice between using a truly decentralized coin or using Libra because no one will prefer to use a centralized shitcoin over a centralized Corporate coin.

I understand the importance of encrypting the file before storage, but why are you recommending the OP to spread their Bitcoins in 20+ addresses, is there any security gain from this?
