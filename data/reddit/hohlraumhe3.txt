You must be confused, you seem to have mixed up a set of individuals with a Wikipedia article.


Yet you claimed to be the representative of this group of people and that you could determine who belonged...


So they're like conspiracy theorists that agree with you?
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:42:11
Are you seriously accusing me of watching Fox News because I know how government is funded? Where do you think your tax dollars go? They go to wars. They go to wiretap us. They go to torture camps and no-knock raids and systematic corruption. 
That's your "common good". That's what you're defending. I hope the welfare money is worth your honor.
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:20:42
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:03:01
Nope, this is what our system has determined the "common good" is. This torture, these wars, all the wiretapping, all the evil that is the US government is directly on the hands of state-worshipers like yourself. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:17:44


Who comprises this "community"? What are the standards for admission?
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:02:51


A community is a group of people that are easily identifiable. You posted to a Wikipedia article. 


Haha, no they banned me for being skeptical of the wrong things. Apparently the criterion for admission is being a party-line Democrat.


Translation: if you disagree with their conclusions.

Question: I've heard that airdrops/forks don't always come to those who have their bitcoin in Segwit addresses. Was that true?
I want to move my coins to Segwit but have no reason to move them from my legacy account at the moment and I'm a long-term HODLer.
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:20:25
Nope, that is the "common good", as the system in place has determined it to be. You guys want a huge, intrusive government with limitless power. We don't. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:22:28


You said there was a "community". Where is it located? Who is in charge?


No, I just get annoyed when people employ this tactic. Alluding to a vague group, deciding they're the arbiter of who is in it, and so on. It's a handy way to make broad and inaccurate statements without having to back them up with facts.


Yeah, they're pretty much a group of blowhards that think their political allegiance is rational.


@_date: 2018-01-02 03:22:44


No, the fact that they're being used for evil makes them evil.


And wars, wiretapping, and torture.


Not having a murderous, tyrannical government doesn't imply support of that.
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:47:51
For me, money goes into coinbase in fiat and comes out in Bitcoin. Since Coinbase pays the fees I, as a user, actually don't benefit from them implementing Segwit unless it is on the deposit side. 
I think Segwit adoption is a huge issue and that bitcoin is being held back by the effects of people not adopting it but I don't think the users of Coinbase are directly affected by their foot-dragging here.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:45:14
I just want to see them stop with this serialized seasons madness.

[The common good](
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:14:46
As long as someone is running nodes somewhere Bitcoin can continue. Have governments stopped piracy?
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:06:48
Yeah, after their recent shenanigans I'm going to another exchange. To their credit I got the crypto I bought out, but it took almost a day and it was a very nervous one.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:54:31
What happens when the mempool fills up? Isn't there a a limit?

Where can I read this contract? I want to know the specific terms. They seem to keep changing.
Also, can I see where I signed?
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:57:13
Bitcoin gold.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:49:43
Won't a bitcoin transaction, before conversion and mining fees, also pay the price that's jacked up for credit card and cash people? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:59:24
Fee: 0.002 BTC...
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:02:20
2.99%? What, do you not pay your monthly balance?
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:35:39
I wouldn't read the scripts but others would. And then it'd be all over @_date: 2017-08-11 16:55:28
It'll put a slight damper on my enjoyment if I, without looking for it, run into the end of the series ahead of time. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:11:18
What ATM even lets you set the fee?
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:13:55
Eh, out of all the arms of law enforcement the SEC is okay and does a job that needs to be done. The people affected by it have essentially opted in.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:20:40
The US, but I'm not a citizen yet, if that matters. I am here legally.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:21:54
This will probably be for more money than I'm comfortable exchanging that way. Also, didn't some guy in Michigan get busted selling BTC that way?
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:22:43
What about the other way? I'm looking to buy and hold BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:39:45
Do you know of a way to get money into GDAX faster? I'd used it but it takes Coinbase like a week to accept my cash deposit from my bank. So far I've lost more money waiting on the cash to show up than I would have from the 2% fee.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:18:47
I always just tell myself I would have sold at $50 or $100 anyway.
@_date: 2016-09-18 23:52:27
Thanks for your reply. I ended up downloading the blockchain and transferring the coins to an Electrum wallet. I'm out of the loop but it seems legit. 
And yeah, the blockchain is too large. It came in at 90 Gb. That means I can't run it on my phone and my SSD-based laptop is too small for it. I understand that this is an unavoidable part of the system and appreciate Electrum's workaround.
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:37:28
It costs bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-17 01:07:29
Yeah, I was surprised when, downloading the blockchain fresh the last year started at about the 60% mark.
@_date: 2016-09-15 15:52:24
@_date: 2016-09-15 15:56:11
Thanks. I'm going to do that. I just don't want to waste 70 Gb of bandwidth downloading the sucker only to immediately delete it.
@_date: 2019-01-05 06:14:46
@_date: 2016-09-17 01:44:08
Looks like I might find out.
EDIT: NM, now I have 68 confirmations.
@_date: 2016-09-15 16:11:32
It's not like I found an early-days trove of 10,000 BTC or anything, I think it might only be $80 worth. But still, I haven't fucked with Bitcoin in a while due to the unwieldiness of the client and was impressed when playing with electrum on a friend's computer.
@_date: 2019-01-08 23:45:39
I don't have the disk space for hundreds of gigs of blockchain.
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:20:57
I've got my funds in a legacy wallet and was thinking of moving them to a segwit wallet while fees are low. While they're low, they're non-zero and I'm too lazy to add another line to my notebook for the fee. Should I move them over?
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:52:09
Unless fees go down more.
@_date: 2016-09-19 00:31:55
Ahh. It's good to know. I'm just dealing with about fiddy USD worth of bitcoin I mined back in 2012 so it's not a big deal. I probably won't spend them in a manner where I'll mind if they're traced back to me if I spend them at all.
But I do know people who are doing such things and I'll pass on what you told me to them. What wallet would you recommend? Would using a VPN or TOR obfuscate the connection between my IP and my bitcoin addresses? I'm not super worried about the server trying to give me a fake balance, I can hop from server to server easily enough.
@_date: 2016-09-19 00:25:29
It isn't secure or isn't as secure? Doing casual reading of it, it claims that your keys aren't exposed to the server and that it derives your balance and such without revealing your keys. Thank you for your responses, I've been out of the loop for a while so I don't know what's good or bad. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 06:31:04
Thank you much.
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:53:37
And it's actually nothing to leave it where it is.

What's the transaction fee on a one satoshi transaction?
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:41:59
Those can be opened by the authorities or even a banker.
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:31:52
Smart contract with a dead-man's switch. If you don't ping it every two months it sends two relatives you trust the key.
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:42:25
I've had extraordinarily shitty luck with USB drives. My previous method of using Bitcoin involved two USB sticks and Tails. Both died. Obviously I could use less cheap drives but the fact remains that they can fail. Storing one's 26-word passphrase (or whatever) is essential but I can't think of a proper way to do it that's guaranteed to be readable by your heirs and not readable by anyone else. I wouldn't trust a lawyer or anyone else to handle cryptocurrency responsibly since they could probably get away with claiming that purloined coins were "hacked".
@_date: 2018-07-26 14:14:39
This doesn't really relate to crypto. These are entirely different sorts of assets.
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:21:16
They also represent a fraction of a portfolio of assets. Bitcoin is basically fiat.
@_date: 2018-07-19 16:56:37
Yeah, do you keep your entire net worth in your home? Do you have stacks of cash around? 
I bet you have your seeds and private keys for all of your crypto wealth at home.

It was socialism, actually.
@_date: 2018-04-16 03:39:43
No, I'm not. Communism has never been achieved in the form of government. Pol Pot, Mao, Lenin, Stalin, Tito, Chavez, Castro, and all the other shitheads were socialists, usually operating under the banner of "vanguard socialism", which was to seize power and beat the humanity out of people for a hundred generations.
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:59:12
Only in the sense that socialism is inherently authoritarian. It was socialism, though, through and through. Bolivarian socialism was the name of its specific flavor.
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:09:20
Well if we're giving round numbers undue importance we should probably ensure they're actually round, right?
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:38:10
No. Private capital/property exists in Norway and the workers absolutely do not control the means of production.
Norway is a social democracy, just like the US. Anyone who told you otherwise was being dishonest.

Hooray socialism.
