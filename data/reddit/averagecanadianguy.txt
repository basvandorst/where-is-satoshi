He got it back about a week later, the worst part was it was the Christmas money and it was like the 15th of December. But we had a great New Year's :)

Well that's stupid.... They do these things so people can't steal your money from you lol.

I'd rather call every time then deal with someone stealing from my bank account, It's happened to my father.

You should be putting in about %5 of your assets max, that way when things like this happen you don't have an issue waiting.

If you have ever had 13K accessible anywhere you're not poor. Nobody here is buying your shit and if it is true we don't feel bad for you.

Most of my BTC I've mined and the tiny bit I bought was back in August, I'm not even close to worried.

Electricity cost comes out to about 20% of what I make on Nicehash, and I only use 1050TI's and 950's 
Edit: 15%
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:11:51
Well that was stupid...
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:24:24
This guy can't math...
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:33:04
It didn’t do that the last 6 times it dipped like this...
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:41:23
My electricity is $0.065 CAD/KWH, each 1050TI I have running may only make about 30-35CAD a month but they each cost about 6-7 CAD a month to run...
Edit: Oops I over shot how much power each card uses under draw, They cost about 5$ each a month
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:09:06
They started giving that back almost a week ago.
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:16:39
Shopping carts cost way more than $20
