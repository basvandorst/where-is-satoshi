This guy doesn't care about cryptos. He's just another fiat shark. And also a BCash shill, because it helps him generate even more fiat. He and Novogratz are of the same kind: shilling cryptos for fiat. 
Best strategy: ignore them, do not upvote them, and jokes :)

Here a new presentation on Lightning by Alex Melville &amp; Taylor Rhodes
Slides (pdf): 
The video quality isn't very good, but one can follow it comfortably with slides.

There will be a lot to learn &amp; experiment with of course, but the learning curve isn't steep as every step is explained by using real-world examples. This book tries to make any reader successful, regardless if you are experienced with Linux/Bitcoin or not.
Those who know Bitcoin will have no problems to skip the "boring" steps and go directly to Lightning Network. Others, who have maybe only heard a few things about it, will learn how to compile &amp; setup a Full Node first, before doing any other, more complex stuff.
There is a plenty of source code available, so that more experienced readers can also experiment on their own.  Some people prefer to tinker with stuff first, while others prefer to be helped to "get the stuff done" and later come back to learn a bit more.

Meanwhile, we have setup a **BTC payment gateway**. So, just in case you are still interested in those nodes.
Also, we now offer portable nodes, and we have lowered the prices ;)
@_date: 2019-11-26 10:27:22
@_date: 2019-02-26 15:56:38
Yes, the hashes are available and the nodes contain no wallet.dat or anything else that could be linked to a person or manipulated remotely.
@_date: 2019-02-27 07:15:45
We take the official source code from github/bitcoin and compile the binaries manually for every device.
We don't use any "disk images" or pre-compiled binaries. Everything's done from scratch. 
The same applies to other tools like c-lightning and/or LND daemons.
The blockchains also get updated to the latest available state.
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:56:07
I am running my node for days. Also in combination with the Lightning Network (but for an Altcoin, haven't tried it yet with Bitcoin).
In combination with a good power bank it can run for many hours. One can also connect the power bank to a regular energy supply thus keeping it "ready to go" all the time.

Some people value their time more than $40 extra. Also, some people would rather learn about crypto by using something that actually works that investing lots of time to build everything up in advance. Only the blockchain upload+updates takes more time than those $40. But this is of course only my opinion.
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:32:13
Customers are free to ask for exclusion of any binaries. Just write a message during checkout. We can also serve nodes with synced chains only. The default is to offer a customer the full range of services. If a customer is someone experienced with compiling we can of course offer blockchain-only nodes. Other, less tech-savvy customers would prefer the all-in-solution. 
It's really not a problem to exclude any binaries. Just add a message during checkout :)
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:53:56
Past performance is not a good crystal ball.
@_date: 2019-02-26 15:49:20
Could be easily added. The customer only needs to write a message during checkout. LND or c-lightning is not a big problem.

5000mAh. Power bank itself costs $15. Plus $10 mini-hdmi-to-cable (can't use normal HDMI with raspi zero). Then add everything else plus manual work. These raspi nodes are unique, not copied over sdcard-images.
@_date: 2019-02-14 02:24:22
7 to 10 hours if you buy good power banks (certified companies).

Some people love gadgets. Others would like to try out something new, like portable nodes. Different people different preferences.
@_date: 2019-02-26 12:33:48
Thanks for pointing this out. I will add more info to make it clearly understandable.
@_date: 2019-02-26 12:31:59
Yes, it comes with fully synced chain and pre-installed wallets.
@_date: 2019-02-14 16:12:33
I forgot to add that from those $40 around $15 will go to the payment processor (must have one, because of taxation/documentation requirements). So, in the end...not that much richer ;)
@_date: 2019-02-14 05:24:48
These devices are for people who are maybe not that experienced (or simply don't want to invest their time).
@_date: 2019-02-26 05:31:45
They "should know" sounds a bit patronising. People are perfectly capable to decide for themselves, imo. Some will do, others won't.
@_date: 2019-02-25 22:00:05
As I said, different people different preferences. The same applies to tech experience. Easy to some, time consuming to others.

We only use the official source code from github/bitcoin and have nothing to do with any of those forks like Unlimited, XT, bchash, BSV and so on. We do not sync the chains from those projects. We don't sell nodes that are compatible with those projects.

The current code is on [ but if you are interested in "digital archeology" you can check the old sourceforge archives: [

Sadly, not allowed by the authorities. Any trading and/or payments with cryptocurrencies would invalidate my company bank account. But you can use all the options from paypal (credit card etc.). SEPA payments will be integrated soon (according to my bank). I am really sorry, but I can't change anything there. I know, paying with BTC would be much better, for customers and for me, but there are forces that I can't move in any direction.
@_date: 2019-01-31 15:06:43
I did it. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 15:02:18
Yes, that's true. The chips have been designed by someone else. But at least the software is pure open source.

Well, there is a law that prohibits that: A company in the UK is not allowed to operate if it has no VAT registration (which I have) and if it has no company bank account (and one can not use "private" bank account for that).
And then there is another catch: if you're a non-resident you can not have a bank account, unless you go great lengths to get one, which I did.
Regarding paypal, in every invoice there is a separate tax entry and everything goes to the UK bank account. There isn't any step where the money's being converted. So even if I would take BTC I wouldn't be allowed to convert them to GBP (even if I would do everything as they want...tax entry etc.). It must be GBP from the beginning to the end. And I can only pay from my company bank account which is audited yearly by the HMRC.
I am really sorry, but there is really no way around. At least not for non-residents.
@_date: 2019-01-21 10:25:42
It's possible with "Custom Nodes". Every node is unique. Everything's handmade, from assembling to compilation and documentation. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 10:57:59
The problem is that I have to pay taxes every few months. I am not a British resident. The company is registered in London, UK but I am from Germany (because in Germany bureaucracy is even harder).
I had even problems to publish our mobile app on AppStore, because Apple didn't want to publish a crypto-app if you're not registered as a "company" on their platform (it's their rule that all apps that deal with cryptos can only be published by "legal entities" not by individuals).
Therefore I incorporated an Ltd in the UK. And to get a company bank account you actually need to be a resident. Unless you have lots of nerves and much time to do phone calls until you finally get an approval. It took me two months to get the account.
But the very first sentence in the bank account contract was: "we do not offer bank accounts to companies who trade or use cryptocurrencies". The only currency that's allowed is British Pound Sterling.
Also the HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue &amp; Customs...the British IRS) only accepts Pound Sterling and I am legally obliged to keep all of the invoices in that currency. Not only to pay taxes, but also to receive payments in GBP. I am not even allowed to convert it inside Paypal to any other currency.
I am really sorry, but there is no other way. Or I would risk to provoke authorities. I don't think I would have that much influence as a non-resident. So, I am glad that I at least have a company bank account and can conduct business.
But I perfectly understand why you don't like these circumstances. I am on your side, and I hope one day we won't have to talk about all this bureaucracy anymore.
Kind regards,

 offers full nodes for Bitcoin and Altcoins.
No closed source stuff in there.

A single SDXC card costs between $40 and $100.
Also the work itself (compilation, documentation, individual support) costs something. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:00:19
But you do. :)

No, no, not an SJW or similar groups. Just check my blog if unsure. 
It was just my own opinion that's actually not needed to personally insult anyone. The arguments from the tweet are perfectly OK, imo, but I saw no reason to use any insults. It only makes the argument weaker.
Kind regards,

"useful idiot" is a term Lenin first used, if I am not mistaken. :) 
This would be a very good comparison, as those gentlemen have tried to hijack Bitcoin and put it under observation by some (un)known "dear leaders", miners etc.
Kind regards,

"idiot", "you suck", "f*** off" and other nobel-prize-worthy expressions should better leave the Bitcoin eco system. Just my 2ct.

Not a beginner, actually. How thick my skin is, well, I don't know. How thin are culture &amp; respect, this is the question, imo.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:08:22
Yes, this time it wasn't anything personal. However, in this space we are very fast with insults. This can already be seen in the answers to my original comment. And no, there's no "cause" I am fighting for (not an SJW or anything like that). No need for that. 
I wrote a simple comment like anyone else does, but it seems some people found it more important to write different insults towards my person than to write in respect to the real cause from the thread title.
Kind regards,

A shitcoin/ICO investor is talking about Bitcoin.

You can buy such a node. Even one that you could carry around (based on Raspi Zero W):

An interesting idea that went full retard with ICOs. Meanwhile ~~Skynet~~...Lightning became fully operational. :)
