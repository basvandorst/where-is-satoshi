Let me guess?
1) no access to money / can't afford to invest
2) no access to a bank account and bitcoin exchange
3) already invested but lost your coins on bad trades
4) lost all your money in gox and hate bitcoin
edit: 5) you are paul krugman

No. All the green lock tells you is that you are on the site it says it is.
It doesn't mean a hacker hasn't compromised the page.

Apple used to be the cool underdog. History has a habit of repeating itself. I used to dream of a post Microsoft world but apple is far more sinister.   It's great we have bitcoin and they can't own it :)  I certainly won't be upgrading to the iPhone 6

having to visually look at a human readable name to check against is a good idea but it's still open to abuse.

wired is a shitty publication that is still living off a couple of decent years it had when it was actually read last century. I used to buy it but gave up as 90% of the mag became ads.

yes, yes. print out your coins and make a paper wallet, then put it under the floorboards. better safe than sorry

hi, i wasn't implying we should relive the consumer age. i agree with you in that I don't think that's the way we should be going, but currency does have to be distributed, and spending is one practical way of achieving this.
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:19:49
tell you what we'll all hand over our own common sense, stop looking at charts and reading everything, and just listen you instead.   job done.  I've just switched to fiat. I advise the world to do the same.

interesting. I'd like to look into the history of the US dollar to see if that suffered from extreme volatility in it's early phases.

Hi Everyone,
thanks for your help with this!
All sorted now.  On your advice I imported the paper wallet into blockchain.info and then sent it to an address in my multibit wallet. worked a charm!
