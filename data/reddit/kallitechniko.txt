Just click buy again and it will go through normally your bank should send a message asking if you made the purchase and if you did and it was canceled to make the purchase again.

That’s stupid been in the traditional markets since 06 and crypto since 2012 when I first took the plunge I still thought it was a joke but was money hungry and couldn’t pass up opportunity. So I sat down read James lopp bitcoin and white paper from satoshi nakamoto and asked many of my friends like Sean navage who works for Wells Fargo and Matthew Underwood who works for some firm as a senior financial adviser in North Carolina Matt said it was a scam and to watch out. I then started doing market cycle and chart analysis and figured well I can drop 10k if I make it I make it if I don’t I lost 1/8th of my salary o well. Needless to say I sold way to early and bought back in at 1k my first buy was around 260 range as it was pushing and my second by was at 3k then all the buys after that we’re from 5k and upwards moral of the story is make sure your numbers are correct and know the chart cycles and understand what this is first when you do and it clicks and you actually have the analysis to prove this is going up it won’t matter anymore. 
To finish the story my friend Matthew Underwood bought bitcoin this year at the bottom finally. Sean hasn’t even responded nor wants to discuss it at all and don’t know why but did tell me congratulations on the big W...
If I had the faith to know bitcoin would of reached 20k in just 5 years I would of just hodled...��‍♂️����

A full node validates transactions and blocks, and relays them to other nodes. A miner is a full node that also extends the block chain by creating new blocks with the new transactions relayed from other nodes. Since both miners and non-miners do validation, all participate in the consensus process.

Miners are a subset of nodes as all miners must be running a full node in order to mine (at least to mine properly). The nodes are what determine consensus as all nodes must agree to the same rules otherwise the nodes will fork off of the network.
Miners can add blocks to the blockchain so long as every other node on the network agrees that their block fits the consensus rules and accepts it.

Your an idiot and so is everyone who downvoted you millennials are so fucking stupid dealing with you idiots is a joke,
first and foremost we didn’t say anything about the fucking white paper?, read that more times then your grandma read gone with the wind. 
Go re read our comment you dumb fucks . We said “it’s a store of value right now” not that it was created to be a store of value wtf you all are so stupid I can’t believe It!, context is very important. The biggest wallet holders are using bitcoin as a store of value case in point. Since that happened lightning was created cause the fees were high and the transaction time doesn’t fit modern day commerces SOT expectations. Therefor we don’t care what bitcoin was created for everyone knows fucking that �� what we said in context was that it’s being used as a store of value right now. Go back to fucking school and learn context in language arts its obviously your worst subject and get off of social media you look so stupid it’s a good thing you use a fake name and fake picture.��‍♂️

See ya at 6.6k

I remember in 2012 people thought $10,000 bitcoin was wishful thinking... lol
@_date: 2019-12-14 20:33:54
Yea but it’s getting old now. Also with more bitcoin locked away in wallets like quadriga cx the supply is getting more and more limited. In my personal opinion I feel according to market cycles the exchange trading bots can at least push it to 40k+ a year after the halving.
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:11:12
�� wtf?
@_date: 2019-12-17 03:40:27
Now they have a 6800 btc lol
@_date: 2019-12-14 21:06:40
Actually it was around 6600 range before the bounce to 7500 in the past month... but close enough I guess...
@_date: 2019-12-26 04:39:46
Super old news but yea most people thought it was a scam even me I didn’t buy into btc till late 2012
@_date: 2019-12-03 16:21:01
�� ok
@_date: 2019-12-12 17:14:59
Accumulating is key. Just stack sats and don’t worry what anyone else is doing. You got the idea so just stack them sats and get as much bitcoin as you can and store it safely use it if you want or hoard it if you want. Just do you bro.
@_date: 2019-12-13 06:38:46
Yup but I remember people screaming for full retrace to 989 this dropped as low as 6600 watched it bounce from there in the past month. I’m just saying I want it to go down but will we break down past the 6600 support level only time will tell.
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:41:49

Very true market cycle analysis proves this... that’s fine by me though we have been saying this since 2017 and been getting bashed although we thought the bottom was around 2k that 3.2  was still close enough. Still looking for 3k or lower myself to load again. This is going to be the highest range we have ever bought and wish I could go back to 2012 and sell my soul for a million dollars and spend it all at $13...��
@_date: 2019-12-15 18:10:17
6600 incoming and hopefully down to 5500 after that the solid support is around 3200 so this could go to 4k and explode after that to new all time highs.

@_date: 2019-12-15 21:49:05

I’m so bullish on btc though so hate all you want that I want the value to go down but we should all want that to buy more at an inexpensive rate.
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:19:44
Lol their talking about quadriga cx exchange founder but yea I see your point it’s pretty comical.
@_date: 2019-10-15 19:38:49
We’re headed towards the mid support range if you didn’t buy in Jan 2018 around 3100-3500 your late much less buying anytime before 2016 was your best opportunity and an opportunity you may never get again in your existence so to be honest you may have a chance around 4000/4500 before the halving occurs next year. More capitulation is coming and some bounce plays as well.

$100 would of bought around 1700 coins or so even now that’s unthinkable money for many. But many back then didn’t have the patience to hold for ten years much less pass it to their offspring.
@_date: 2019-12-18 04:07:12
First time cnn got something right. If you were to buy $100 of bitcoin in 2009 at .06 you would have 1700 coins which would be over 11 million dollars today so anyone who is knocking this needs to go back to the 3rd grade and learn basic multiplication again.

Same here we started in 2012 and held during 2018 we actually took much of it and put it into different accounts multiple accounts to bypass the kyc on most exchanges and started buying alt coins we have several cold storages, a handful of paper keys in the safe and over 40 web and app wallets trying to spread it out. We never kept our money on an exchange though as we saw what happened to MT Gox. It’s funny though cause we have ambivalence for not selling at the top I mean it was only a few days btc went from 10k to 19.8k it was so surreal trying to calculate the value but since then we have lost so much value We could just curl up into a ball and ��. Enjoyed your story though. It’s nice meeting an early adopter.
