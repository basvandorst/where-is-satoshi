If they hadn't redesigned their web site so terribly. Removed the sub-doamin ca.gizmodo.com for viewing the old layout. I would still view their web site everyday. Now it's on my black list till it gets fixed or changed back to the old layout.

I'm happy with BTC Guild, I'm not sure if Mtred charges a fee? I have 9 people (12 computers) mining under my BTC Guild. It's a pain in the ass getting them all to change servers. It take several hours since some of them are located in different area's.

I try to look at it as free money since it was mined. My friend and I are pooling our together to throw bachelor party for a friend. It's not like I'm going to be spending it on myself anyways.

Ordered from the site, and received my gift cert with no problems. Excellent customer service.

I love the drama, I think it's the biggest reason I keep playing the bitcoin game.

I sold a bunch at $19.10, and it jumped to $23, so I sold a bunch more, then it jumped to $25. I'm kicking myself in the ass for selling.

It's bunch of friends mining on their work computers and home computers. I can tell them we're switching sites, but it could take them minutes or days to switch. None of them pay attention to see if there machines are running. I just watch the page for them and text them if it's been over 24 hours. Sometimes they turn it off to watch movies or play a game. Which is fine since I do the same thing.

Even if mtgox is telling the truth or not, I still plan on switching to a different exchange.

For being worth nothing, people keep buying them from me for a nice chuck of change.

I think it go up for next few weeks since it's gaining tons of press. It drop down to $15-20, and slowly grow to $25-30. Which it will sit for a long time.

The bitcoin will be back to around 17.5$/BTC after we rollback all trades that have happened after the huge Bitcoin sale that happened on June 20th near 3:00am (JST).
Service should be back by June 20th 10:00am (JST, 01:00am GMT) with all the trades reversed and accounts available.
One account with a lot of coins was compromised and whoever stole it (using a HK based IP to login) first sold all the coins in there, to buy those again just after, and then tried to withdraw the coins. The $1000/day withdraw limit was active for this account and the hacker could only get out with $1000 worth of coins.
Apart from this no account was compromised, and nothing was lost. Due to the large impact this had on the Bitcoin market, we will rollback every trade which happened since the big sale, and ensure this account is secure before opening access again.
