Actually not that random. The typical average follower count is 2000-4000, and the more tweets you have, the more stable this average is.
So most of the time the word with the most tweeters also has the most total followers.
Of course a well known celebrity weighs in more, but that could be interpreted as part of the fun :)

I expected more people to submit games, and wanted a very small fee to deter bullshit submits.
But you're right, fow now I'd much rather pay for good game ideas than request BTC.
I have removed the fee from /submit
As for 'own games using news click bait topics' - I'm not sure what that means.
So anyone who feels like submitting a game -&gt;

Ironically it's the other way around. I already have a UK marketplace that has processed over $32 million worth of coin trades since 2012 (22 million GBP to be precise).

I've created some new games (some of them based on suggestions in this thread). Bet away!
And here's a few more codes to [use](
    Code REDDIT-KTPTWF-0.01 expiry 2015-05-01 amount 0.01 BTC
    Code REDDIT-BFHKBF-0.01 expiry 2015-05-01 amount 0.01 BTC
    Code REDDIT-EFTWFC-0.01 expiry 2015-05-01 amount 0.01 BTC
    Code REDDIT-ERBPFX-0.01 expiry 2015-05-01 amount 0.01 BTC
    Code REDDIT-WWRTFE-0.01 expiry 2015-05-01 amount 0.01 BTC

The frontend is a simple webserver as you can see, if you meant something more specific just ask away. As for the backend (these run continuously):
- A script to fetch tweets and put 'em in a buffer
- A script to move the tweets from the buffer and check/mark down if the tweeter is a celebrity
- A script to check which tweets apply to which games and increment the counters, do the calculations
- A script to observe the game status, calculate results
And of course a bunch of other stuff like processing incoming coins, sending withdrawals, auto-withdrawals etc.

Same here. Was never into betting or Twitter much.
However I've wanted to create a site similar to betsofbitco.in for a long time, but with a data source that continuously supplied info that was not up to interpretation or a human checking the results. Then I ran into Twitter's streaming API...
@_date: 2015-04-07 10:07:28
PHP &amp; NodeJS for websockets (only needed to show tweets in realtime when a game is playing).

It strongly depends on the type of game. I haven't seen any manipulation attempts so far, that's why I'm posting some low frequency word games.
If it becomes a problem, we'll just use games with a longer timespan, higher frequency words, rely more on total follower count rather than tweeter count, celebrities, etc.

Actually no, I do not realise it, I just know the library they provide is named Phirehose and it fetches realtime tweets from the URL I posted. I don't see how the word 'bullshit' applies here.
It's public in the sense that anyone can use it for free, it's less public in the sense that you have to verify a phone number and Oauth to the API (rather than simply connecting to a completely public and open API).
If your point is "he doesn't understand all the different Twitter API's" I guess that's fair, I really don't care for them much. I use what I need for this site to work and if you look at a game in progress you'll see it works like a charm.

It's encouraged, not stopped.

'1% of firehose' is pretty ambigous in that post. It doesn't necessarily mean 1% of tweets are returned only. I've been playing this for a long time now and never have I seen myself tweeting something that didn't make it into the tweet logs. If the 1% claim was even remotely true in the sense that you thought it meant, I would have a 1% chance to see my own tweets in the logs. Instead I'm seeing 100%.
My guess is that 1% is about the maximum rate they will provide to someone using the API. You could still sample just a few keywords (not 400 which is the maximum limit for the public API - we're using a LOT less!).
This public streaming API will drop tweets if there are too many coming in at once - that is true. And it's mentioned in the BETwitter FAQ that it may not always have all tweets. But in practice I haven't been able to produce this.
Some games containing the words 'LOL' and 'love' and 'fuck' have observed over 50k tweets / hour. Most other games work with 1-2k tweets / hour / word, so it's far from needing to drop anything.
I don't claim that BETwitter is provably fair, but provably unfair is also not true IMHO.

Now you have changed it to:


I'll just take that as progress made on your end. Thanks, I guess (?).
My impression is, it doesn't return full data when the client is asking for too big of a sample (and we don't do that). You're basing your opinion on a forum post, I'm basing my opinion on about a month of testing.
"Scam" ? Please tell me you're not serious about that. That's just malicious :( You can't honestly think that I'm trying to scam anyone. I created a game that I would be very happy to play myself. If you are worried that there are dropped tweets AND those dropped tweets actually change the outcome of games, it's probably fair not to play or even say the game sucks. But I disagree with both of those assumptions based on my experience so far.
Arguing with people on the internet is not my strong suit and it doesn't look like anyone cares for the game anyway (and that's not because of the 1% claim). I don't think I'll keep this back &amp; forth up, hope there are no hard feelings because of this.

I'm going back to rewriting my VPN provider's backend &amp; website from scratch. I doubt I'll have time for BTC projects for a while. Good luck with your project though! Send me a PM when it's done, I'll check it out.
