If coin base goes down the way gox did, the media will have a field day and mla lot of potential new investors will be turned off for a while. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:04:20
Wow, thank you very much!

Right now I have .16 bitcoin in Doge. But Doge is also easy down in price right now because of the Gox situation causing people wary of cryptos. Doge always follows Bitcoin. So I could have a lot more real soon. And I'm looking at this from an investment standpoint. If I bought .5 bitcoin, that's all I'd ever have.  With the GPU I bought, in a couple months time, I'll have more than .5 bitcoin and I'll never have to stop mining either. 
Plus I didn't have $400 outright and neither did my friend. He put it on his Newegg line of credit which I'm paying him back for.

Yeah see I don't really want to stress myself out with it. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 11:22:14
Haha, I know all about that . Believe me, I've been around for a couple months and read my fair share of info. I own a little more than 1/10 bitcoin in Dogecoin. The thing is that I can't buy. All I can do is mine. Thanks for the info though! 
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:23:35
Haha I'll try not to ;) 
@_date: 2014-03-05 11:37:50
You sure? That's really nice of you. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:43:44
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:50:29
Yeah. I totally feel dumb right now for not selling while Doge was at 280. But I'm not too sure how well I'd do day trading either. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:42:49
Yeah, does that make sense? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:14:37
Mr. President, I have a very important question. Is it true that you like Starbucks? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:46:14
"snitched" haha. Are we 10 now? Come on, they did the right thing. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:32:32
My mom has been worried what I was doing with this was illegal from the start. She wouldn't listen to me, but when she saw it on the news, she was all for me doing it. Ignorant. At least now she listens to my explanation of Gox. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 21:38:52
All I'm going to say is just because something is fun, doesn't mean it's immature or anything less than legitimate. What you're saying is exactly what everyone else has said and does say about Bitcoin. And yet, you all are successful. Have a positive outlook! Be friendly! Whether you like it or not, Bitcoin and Dogecoin are, in people's minds, very similar in many ways. That's going to be hard to change! I want you to change your mind! Here!

Play the ole' switcheroo on 'em? I think we could do that.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:04:48
Thanks a lot! 
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:05:47
I seriously just might put in an order for one satoshi just to see what happens.. Lol
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:38:57
Haha, cool :) 
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:28:57
Ahh. It does work on my computer as well. I guess the mobile site is just screwed. My phone's browser can be turned into "desktop view" and that also works.
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:11:10
Hmm.. I haven't got anything yet. Is the bot usually fast?
Edit: Nevermind, I got it! All is well my friend, thank you! 
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:47:16
Yes. Yes you did. Thank you by the way. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:43:21
You know, I've seriously thought about it. But I think Doge has a much larger window to grow. So  if I switch to bitcoin, sure, my investment would likely double. And that's great. But once bitcoin doubles, Doge will follow. Plus, Doge has a lot of growing to do in its own merit. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:51:05
Wow. You sir, are a legend.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:12:18
You like it? No, I like it. Seriously though, these people are crazy. I feel like I'm in the dogecoin subreddit. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:02:39
Exactly! 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:47:36
Yeah it really is.
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:54:57
Yes, theoretically. I just, in no way, can afford ASICs to even make a dollar per day with bitcoin. Hell, I had a hard enough time buying a $400 GPU to mine Doge with. I had to get a friend to loan me the money. And I had to sell a PS3 and a guitar amp to pay him off, well I still am. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 11:05:29
Nope. Stuck using altcoins. Let's hope for the best. I still like reading up on the success of bitcoin though. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 04:00:12
A very important thing to do would be to read up on how Bitcoin works, so you aren't blindly walking into this. There are a few official sites with all the information you need. I recommend you browse those sites and take in all the info you can from them. bitcoin.org would be a great start. 
Once you've done that, there are a couple places his Bitcoins might be stored. He might have had "paper wallets" as stated before and he also might have an application on the computer called Bitcoin-qt or anything with bitcoin in the name really. I would just search programs and files for bitcoin. 
The next step, once you have found if or where there are bitcoins, would be to figure out or find his password (assuming he had one). You will not ever be able to move those coins without the password, so that's very important.
And finally, if you get access to the coins, would be to exchange them with a very trusted site. It may take a while to get to this point, so I'll just leave this for later.
I really hope my post can help you in any way, and I wish you the best with this. It would be best for you to do this on your own; maybe getting a few family members to help would be a good idea. But like everyone has said, be very careful and very untrusting of anyone outside of your family when it comes to this. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:22:31
Thank you! :) 
@_date: 2014-03-05 11:24:07
This is true. But what good is ONE satoshi when I already have 16 million? ;) 
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:17:56
I'm guessing the 1 person you're excluding would be the CNN writer who explained this whole thing wasn't a problem with Bitcoin. Either way, I'm really hate modern journalism more each day. It's a cancer to things they cover..
@_date: 2014-03-05 10:18:59
I woke up today, and didn't have any Bitcoin. And that's probably because I never did.. Toopoorforbitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:00:57
No mainly because I can't afford to go out and buy coin. And I certainly can't mine bitcoin. At the current difficulty, it would take 4761+ YEARS to mine the equivalent in bitcoin to what I've mined in dogecoin in one month. 
I really wish I could buy some bitcoin but that's impossible for me at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:22:32
Didn't really think my first question through. I know the value of a bitcoin will rise as the supply gets smaller. My thought process was would mainstream people want to trade in .01 bitcoin and smaller, but I guess that's already the case since it's so valuable.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:21:26
I've been out of the cryptography currency scene for a little while. And I'm seeing that bitcoin just keeps getting more valuable, so it's tempting for me to try and get in on it. So I have a few questions if you wouldn't mind.
There is a limited amount of bitcoin IIRC, so long term, do you think bitcoin would be a valid currency due to the nature of it? Since bitcoin can be lost forever, whether it's a bad hard drive or a wrong address, what would happen when the amount starts to dwindle down?
And also, what would you contribute it's recent success to? Genuinely curious. I used to follow it a few years ago but I was a broke teen in highschool.
