Or GDAX

No, it's a reference to a guy on a forum who was shitfaced and spelled it "HODL".  But now it just stands for "hold on for dear Life".
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:44:03
Well yeah? That's how they work 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:50:35
But that's the problem. Everyone has been saying that "the ship sailed" every time a new high has been reached. Just trade what you can and sit on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:49:51
GDAX and Bitfinex are the only ones hat matter really 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:38:01
Yes, because at the time this was posted, $9,700 was the highest it had ever been. It was considered jumping on late 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:59:42
Well that's the risk. It could go up and you could make more, or it could go down. Depends on what your investment was. If we're talking thousands of dollars, maybe sell off half if you need the money.

Wtf are you babbling about

Jesus these firms are getting hungry for a piece of the action. So far with Cboe launching, things have been stable, but price has been slowly increasing. So maybe this is a good thing after all. Futures are supposed to reduce volatility anyways.

Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:23:44
Get on Coinbase and buy with a card. $25, $50, $1000, whatever you're comfortable with losing is what you can buy.

You beat me to the meme. I've been trying to fire off as many as I can to distract me from watching the ticker. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:46:54
JUST DO IT
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:10:10
Well that's not what it's showing. I'd give it another go

@_date: 2017-11-28 05:53:51
Where have you seen? All charts are showing it hasn't passed $10k yet
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:25:00
You turned out to be right 
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:20:23
I also accept bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:53:51
Same. I'm just keeping my emails and spreadsheets up to look busy

Coinbase announced it is doing maintenance between 1-3
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:14:42
Well it's showing you registered as an institution. Are you registering on behalf of your business or entity? If you're just a regular person, you need to register as such
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:09:30
Looks like you're going to be right, it's almost at $9950
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:54:14
Lmao gtfo
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:26:53
I'm not sure what you mean. Under application request it says "institutional Application", meaning you applied as an institution
