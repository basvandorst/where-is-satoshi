This makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the feedback! Will look into this

Who leaked this to you?

I made this meme 2 months ago for a bit there was starting to think I might not get to use it for another couple of years.
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:54:24
Thank you
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:22:28
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:23:03
Of course. Glad you like it!
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:36:38
Thanks for checking it out. 
1. The data comes in from CoinCap's public API 
2. The permissions is an issue that I am looking into and will hopefully fix in the next update (this is the first app I have published and I clearly messed up somewhere during that process).  Obviously the app doesn't need any of those permissions to function.
Thanks again!
@_date: 2017-08-28 02:24:37
I’m glad you like it! Considering I’ve just released the app, I’m mostly just looking for feedback so that 1. If there are bugs I can fix them and 2. If there are features/improvements that people show a lot of interest in, I will focus on those. The app does exactly what I want it to now, and I want to be careful about making sure that it doesn’t lose it’s simplicity, however, this app is really for you guys, so I want it to evolve in ways that make it more useful to the bitcoin and greater crypto community and not just myself.

@_date: 2017-08-28 21:28:57
You aren't the first person to bring this up and I am currently working on a fix. Bottom line, obviously it needs none of these to work. This is the first app I've published and clearly, I messed up somewhere along the way during the play store submission process. Thanks for letting me know and check back soon.
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:16:11
Thanks for checking it out and I'm glad you like it. Can you explain how you envision the sorting feature working? The coins are ranked by their real-time market caps (price x supply).
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:25:36
Okay, this makes sense now. I am still a little confused as to the relevance of price sorting. To me, price is an arbitrary measurement and relative to a specific coin. For example, if a coin has a price of $1,000 but there is only a supply of 10 circulating then that is very different from a coin with a price of $.001 but a circulating supply in the hundreds of billions. You might be on to something here, and I just want to understand what value you see in price sorting. I don't want to be missing something. Thank you for your help!
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:22:20
Spelling was so it wasn't removed by the bot
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:09:35
This is a top priority and will be changed soon. Thanks for your patience.
@_date: 2017-08-28 06:55:10
I'm glad you like it.
1. I noticed some lag as well when using slightly older phones and when there is very large trade volume. I am working to make the app lighter and will send that out in an over the air update so you will hopefully just open the app soon and that won't be an issue. May I ask what's the exact model of your phone (feel free to message me)?
2. Currently, commas only work on the iOS app. I need to add them to Android (this is at the top of my list).
3. The arrow is a good idea.
Thank you for taking the time to download and let me know about this. It means a lot.
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:18:05
I appreciate it
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:45:18
This is true and maybe something I add down the road. I have written this down. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:27:27
Awesome to hear that you are enjoying it. Thanks for the suggestions. Charts would be really nice I think. Will see what I can do, although there are several more pressing issues. 
I made the app with React Native btw. Really enjoyed learning it and am impressed with performance. I would highly recommend it if you want to speed up the dev process on both Android and iOS. 
Thanks for checking it out!
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:30:49
First time I have heard this. Thanks for the suggestion. I'm really glad you like it!
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:18:20
I'm glad you like it. More data points would be pretty easy to integrate. If I can gather enough useful ones I would consider making a second page that you can swipe to in the drop down. Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:31:33
So from my understanding and limited experience trading, you can buy any fraction of a token/coin that you like. You are ultimately buying a very small slice of the pie (the market cap).
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:48:46
You are completely right that the return from $.01 to $10 would be massive, however, because many of these coins have absurdly large supplies, a jump that large would probably mean eclipsing bitcoin's market cap which is extremely unlikely. I in no way want to offend you, and just want you to make smart investments so I highly recommend you look into this further and consult others before investing more money. The price is truly an arbitrary number and many coins set a low price hoping people will think that this means huge upside. From an economical, mathematical, and logical standpoint you should not be trading based on price but by market cap (with very few exceptions like when there is slight push back just before a coin passes a pretty looking number in a popular currency etc.). This is a common misconception with crypto trading and a lesson best learned at the start.
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:22:45
Additional currency support is at the top of my list of things to work on. Also, I am being very deliberate about changes to the app. I don't want it to lose its simplicity either. Any additions will be very secondary to the main UI (the ladder) and will probably only be noticed by power users, which is fine with me. Thanks for checking it out and great to hear you like it!
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:56:25
Great suggestion and thanks for the positive feedback. If you have any more ideas please message me! 
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:07:02
Thanks for your feedback. I also think charts would be a great addition and am looking into potentially integrating this in the future. The color pulses definitely seem to overlap when there is a high volume of trading, however, real-time is a core focus of the app and not something I want to put the brakes on. There are other apps if you want to just refresh every minute.
Great to hear you like the minimalist design!
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:13:12
This is the first app that I have published, and I am assuming I made an error along the way during the publishing process. Are you looking at Google Play? Not sure why it is listing all of these permissions, as they have nothing to do with the functions of my app. This bothers me and I'm looking into how to fix this and will release an update that should let me get rid of all of these. This is the best kind of feedback. Thank you!!!
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:35:04
I'm pumped that you like it so much. There are a couple more pressing issues right now but maybe down the road, this is something that I could add. Maybe a "pin your favorite coins" to the top of the ladder feature? Thanks for checking it out and giving me this idea!
@_date: 2017-08-28 06:21:08
Thanks NachoKong
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:15:26
There is an inverse correlation between market cap increase and volatility. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:27:21
Ya I actually remember the 800 but not 1300 haha
@_date: 2017-08-28 06:20:43
Are you thinking links to sites to buy the coin or where the latest trade happened at? If it's the former, I'm not trying to get in the business of pushing any particular platform over another so most likely won't do in an effort to be unbiased. If it's the later this is something I would consider doing, however, I want to be really careful that the app doesn't lose its simplicity and ease of use. I don't want to draw attention from the main data points. Maybe a little info button could bring this kind of secondary information up.

I hope this is bc you want to buy not because you have been trading on margin.

I am shocked that this sub is upvoting your post. It's a blatant lie and diminishes the value of posts like this that are actually real.

FYI the site is down but the mobile apps are still working to some degree (I had to do login attempt 5 times) but finally got in. Hope this helps

I'm calling BS. This would be over 111 million if sold right now. The probability of your actually having 38,000 btc vs being someone who's trolling for fun is extremely low.
