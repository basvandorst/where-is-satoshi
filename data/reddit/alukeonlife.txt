My apologies, I could have been clearer: tips are asolutely fine - it's the general adoption of bitcoin where large anonymous donations becomes an issue, say if we were donation 100 bitcoins that could be a problem

LOVE IT! I'm looking forward to getting that email - not something we'll be doing at the moment, but I'll add that idea into the review meeting :-)

Thanks - the wallet can be found on

I've tweeted about it this morning, will schedule another one for later - thanks everyone for your tips!  
@_date: 2014-09-11 13:00:32
Thank you both. All donations are gratefully rec'd, we're already discussing what next.

I've written up some of my thoughts on tipping tuesday + charity adoption - felt like it was a new thread but relevant to here: 
@_date: 2014-11-13 11:39:19
We did get that, thank you!
@_date: 2014-12-02 16:18:31
Thanks - I'll send this on to RNLI
@_date: 2014-09-11 13:03:51
We did look at integrating it with our existing donation process for this reason, for a phase 1 test we felt the cost/time to integrate vs the simplicity of trialling with just a wallet was the right way to go
@_date: 2014-09-11 12:58:20
Thanks for the donation.
@_date: 2014-09-11 12:58:06
Thank you. We're really pleased with how it's worked and the response we've had from the bitcoin community. 
FYI we've had a similar piece in fundraising.co.uk today too, within the charity sector at least, judging by my inbox, it's made a lot of people think!

Tips are fine - I'm talking more generally here about donations to our wallet via RNLI.org/bitcoin
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:06:47
Here you go --&gt; [RNLI Tip.me page]( or via twitter to  
...be amazing if bitcoin donations beat other methods [RNLI Giving Tuesday]( ... just sayin'... ;-)

Yep. Placement of the link is on the list for discussion at the review. Thanks
