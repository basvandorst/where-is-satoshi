Look towards XXB for an instant/feeless solution. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:27:01
Alternatively taking miners out of the equation entirely (see RaiBlocks)

Wow, 0 confs after 10hours at 600sat/b... 
This is madness, is anything actually in the pipeline to solve this issue in the near future? This is probably part of the reason BTC is heavily declining right now..
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:54:46
I'd probably rather just wait a few more days for the transaction to fall off and try again with 10-15sat/b than pay $4

At that volume I would look at putting it into coinfloor, although I've never dealt with that amount so I would wait for other replies. Worth looking into though. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:37:23
Any website that blocks me from going 'back' is not getting a cent of my money or a minute of my time.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:34:29
In this climate, any wallet that doesn't offer fully customizable fees is redundant imo. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:52:36
I'm debating the same thing. $3000 to put in, I would have bought a few days ago but I was waiting for my coinfloor deposit to clear. Buy now or wait for dip..
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:22:32
We're in a dip right now, now is a great time to buy. The fork will occur when the 494784's block is mined, which is approx 18th november.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:15:15
$10k is going to be a huge psychological barrier. I think it will hit 10k then promptly dip a few times before it can exceed it permanently. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:37:32
Not really true, I paid £0.49 for a transaction yesterday which only took a few hours for 4 confirmations, during a 30k transaction queue
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:58:53
Yep definitely sounds like it's just the change transaction, if the numbers add up you have nothing to worry about. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:56:11
Kind of causes great doubt over the longevity of BTC. As difficulty continues to increase, this situation where mining altcoins (like BCH) is more profitable is going to make slow + expensive TX's increasingly more common.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:01:13
How long would you anticipate it will be until fees are back to normal, e.g. 200sat/b or less?
What is the end solution for the issue of miners only being present when fees are high, leading to the huge tx backlogs? I feel like that is Bitcoin's main weakness, which allows altcoins to be a threat to BTC's dominance.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:29:27
If it exceeds 10k for the first time and stays above 10k, I'll.....
Actually, I won't make a promise based on BTC movements. We've all seen how that works out here on Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:56:41
Conversely, a small group of people can choose to completely disrupt the entire network, or cancel it. As they see fit.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:47:33
Oh, I apologize. I interpreted the post to suggest that BCH had over 10x the amount of miners of BTC. I realise now that wasn't the intended claim of this post.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:04:14
Meanwhile my 4sat/b tx has been stuck for nearly 2 weeks :(
 
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:24:01
So that's why my 8 attempts failed. Tried with passport and driving license, both using a high-quality webcam. Wouldn't have it - and of course support is non existent. So that's when I gave up on coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:52:42
I mean, I'm looking to hold for the most part too. However, I read into it and they only charge a 1% fee. Current Coinfloor price is £5,430, bittylicious charges £5,593, less 1% is £5,537.. that's over +£100 per coin, surely there's something I'm missing?
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:43:42
Upvoted and shared with friends to upvote too, I'd be flipping out if this was me so this deserves to be seen to get the ball rolling. Best of luck.

Oh really? That fee percentage is pretty misleading then.

The only stupid part would be cashing out now!
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:08:15
The transaction in question is actually sending my balance from blockchain wallet to my new Electrum wallet! I stuck with blockchain wallet for the customizable fees but as soon as I found out Electrum had the same I jumped ship. Well, I'm trying to..

For GBP coinbase is currently showing £6,099 whereas coinfloor shows £5,899. Biggest variance I've seen, not sure why. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:23:29
Any recommendations for a wallet that supports multi-currency (BTC/ETH as a minimum), customizable transaction fees and preferably multi-platform?
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:29:49
Coinfloor is better than coinbase IMO for UK. Yes you have to use SEPA, however you can send in GBP so you don't get fucked on conversion. There is a nominal withdrawal/deposit fee, but it doesn't amount to much if you're trading 1k+. And there's no transaction fees at all. And support actually exists whereas coinbase's is non-existant.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:44:57
Sorry to be that guy but.. I actually did send 4 different transactions all with the same fee over a 10-15 min period (was transferring to a new wallet). All confirmed within a few hours. In my experience, wallet default fees are far far higher than they need to be, average is like 220 now right? I believe I paid ~50 satoshi/byte
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:08:39
Look up BTC transaction accelerators. The backlog is diminishing fairly quickly now that he miners are back so you should be fine within a couple more days. At least you aren't me and sent at 4sat/b over a week ago..
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:56:55

Have you sold on bittylicious before? Seems too easy to buy from an exchange then resell on there..? Am I taking any risk by accepting UKBT from random people? Must be a catch here.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:03:58
If I'm correct, the size of the transaction is determined by number of inputs/outputs. In this case I was transferring my entire wallet balance to a new wallet, this happened to have 4 inputs putting the byte size over 500. Am I correct in saying I have no control over the transaction size? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:27:58
Sell them while you can! Buy the dip!
My speculation skills aren't advanced enough to provide concrete evidence in the form of lines drawn on a graph. I'll leave that one to the experts. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:12:02
'Amount Withdrawaled' should be a clue!
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:30:53
Yeah my 4sat/b transaction has been stuck for 7-8 days.. 0 confs.
My understanding is after X time (no idea how long) the transaction disappears and the money is returned to the sending wallet. Still waiting for that to happen, though.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:29:05
Nearly 48hours since I stupidly sent a transaction with 4sat/b. Woops. Feelsbadman
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:59:03
Oh I see, I was looking at the 'become a broker' section. Perhaps the sell price is higher as a broker. That sell price is terrible. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:30:50
I'm pretty sure the difficulty is vastly different for each coin, so number of coins mined isn't a very accurate metric. I could be wrong though.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:49:38
Alternatively, use a service like purse.io to purchase goods with your bitcoin, avoids fees and you get a discount from retail prices. Good choice for a small quantity.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:30:04
BTC price is £5,400 right now...
Assuming you're UK.. best exchange for high volume (£1k+) is Coinfloor, lower than 1k use Solidi or bittylicious or local bitcoins to buy your BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:41:23
Unfortunately not! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:22:17
Any idea how long it takes for tx's to cancel/disappear/reverse?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:25:58
It's up to you whether you want to buy BTC or one of the thousands of alt-coins (including bitcoin cash), personally I would stick with plain old BTC or one of the bigger coins such as Ethereum.
You're safe as long as you buy BTC from a popular marketplace, my recommendation for a platform would change depending on which country you're from.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:03:59
That's why I'm backing Coinfloor at the moment, exchange prices without the ridiculous fees, flat fee for deposit/withdraw and even though it's SEPA, you can send in GBP. 
I sent using my HSBC account and I was only charged £4 from my bank + £5 flat + a small % from Coinfloor, which really doesn't add up to much if you're talking about a couple of grand. Way cheaper and you have the flexibility to buy/sell at any time for 0% fee.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:55:42
I really like this analogy.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:40:01
The risk you take when buying at an ATH. Oh well, sit tight, I'm sure a new ATH is around the corner.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:27:24
There are no fees for paying with a traditional debit card or with cash. There are significant fees (in proportion to small transaction amounts) when using bitcoin. Thus, bitcoin is (at this moment in time) impractical to be used as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:34:51
Thresholds are arbitrary.. buy when you can afford to, and try to buy in the dips. But don't worry too much about that - if you believe that BTC will rise in the long term. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:35:18
Ok.. Tell me another wallet that supports fully custom mining fees that's presumably more secure and I'll jump ship.
I would prefer not to use a hardware wallet tbh..
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:22:02
I've heard it takes 2 weeks. But I have no idea the real answer. I would happily take a reversal right now!
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:41:59
Here's mine that's stuck. Stupidly did 4sat/b! 
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:15:24
For real, I just exchanged some ETH for BTC and I paid a £4.02 transaction fee. For transferring £28 of ETH.. something needs to be done about that 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:27:50
The fork is when a 'new' coin will be created, known as Segwit2x. It's quite a complicated and controversial matter, so I would suggest that you Google it as there is plenty of excellent explanations on the web.
In terms of a good or bad time to buy.. it's fully subjective and a matter of opinion. It could literally go either way, there is really no telling. However, since we have just seen BTC skyrocket, and it has now dipped back down to just under $7000, to me it is a good time to get in.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:53:02
I don't *fully* understand it myself (does anyone?) but a few factors are:
 - Bitcoin Cash (BCH) skyrocketed after Segwit2x was announced to not be happening.
 - This made it more profitable to mine BCH instead of BTC (perhaps other coins too) so BTC saw a huge drop in current hashpower
 - Network hashpower correlates with transaction processing speed, therefore transactions have slowed right down. The solution to this is to increase the fee you send your payment with (this is what sat/b refers to - satoshi's per byte of data).
 - 600sat/b is traditionally a very high fee, over $20 as O.P said. If 600sat/b does not confirm a tx within a few hours, something is seriously wrong. Basically, the network is currently congested with 174,000 (and rising) pending transactions, if hashpower does not increase, this number will continue to rise, effectively sending the network to a standstill (unless you want to pay RIDICULOUSLY high fees).
This is the main argument for a hard-fork, to increase block size (or some other metric) in order to allow more tx's to be processed in the same timeframe. I think tx fees and times are a huge detriment to BTC right now (others disagree), however I'm not sure a hard fork is the solution (as Segwit2x was marketed to be).
Take this all with a grain of salt, I'm not an expert. My facts (should) be accurate though!

I had the same issue, among others, with Jaxx wallet. It may be easier to just import your private keys into a new wallet entirely. That's what I ended up doing.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:27:24
Logging in from mobile tells me the service is unavailable. Can't view my balance or anything, just says exit. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:08:48
I would have bought the dip, but I have no fiat left from buying the other dips ��
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:34:20
Ok so I currently hold my BTC in blockchain wallet. Does this mean that if the 2x fork is more popular, I will effectively lose my BTC in favour of 2x BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:03:49
To clarify, coinbase is a service for buying or selling bitcoin, not a wallet. You can transfer your purchased bitcoin to either a software or hardware based wallet (hardware = more secure, more expensive, software = more convenient, potentially less secure, 'nicer' to use. Some of the common wallet services include blockchain.info wallet, Jaxx and Electrum. Do your research and stay safe - it's very easy to lose a lot of money if you don't know what your doing!
Good luck!
