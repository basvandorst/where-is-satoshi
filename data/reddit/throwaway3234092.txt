I don't need fiat. I need bitcoin.

Even that that discount rate they would not do that.

it is an absolutely useless card for more people. nonetheless, it is good that coinbase is introducing this as it means that bitcoin is going more mainstream. i'm guessing the spending limit is there for the same kind of people that lose their private keys or store bitcoin on custodial services. which again, is fine. not my bitcoins, not my business
@_date: 2019-05-08 07:26:19
Right - I'm aware that the wallets were directly hacked.

What's wrong with centralizing power? The exact point of bitcoin is that it's not regulated. It's a free market and a free for all. The nature of a new market that there will be different sized players, each with various amounts of power. It's the wild west. If you don't like coinbase, then hack it. Complaining here on reddit won't do anything; it's certainly not changing my opinion.

takes too much time to login and look at the charts and buy. for such small amounts that i'm going to buy in not worth it otherwise

there's a certain group that thinks btc-&gt;btc is the only solution. it's completely wrong. there are so many industries where credit is by far the best solution - being able to manage cashflow because using a credit card will give you 21+ days of float, being able to file a chargeback on payment disputes, etc. If there's the option to pay by credit card vs. paying by bitcoin, I'll be using my Visa, thanks. Now, if dumb people want to 'support' Coinbase through this debit card, they do them. Not my problem.

phone is thumbprint protected. so it'd be a pretty complex phishing attempt to steal coins, from say, coinbase (which I basically have 0.000001btc on cuz i have a hardware wallet). you'd need my login (unique password), and then my phone for 2FA, unlock it, then hack my email to click the approval link. I believe logging from a new IP freezes any withdrawals for 48 hours, so you'd need to spoof that or fake ID and a webcam shot. while i don't trust the custodial services to be secure, if 2FA is easily hackable then basically everything online out there is screwed
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:01:11
well, absolutely, someone can also hold a gun to your head and then you're screwed and that's for anything except a time delay safe
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:00:50
I mean, I get that 2FA via SMS can be hijacked but something via Authenticator seems harder
@_date: 2019-05-11 20:24:31
well it becomes like dirty fiat no? you can spend it all you like as long as it doesn't touch a financial institution or make a large cash only purchase in settings where KYC/AML regs are in place
@_date: 2018-12-16 08:54:04
was it a cash advance

its dumpinnnn
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:40:03
yes i can just pull out my coinbase app any place in the world and buy things too
@_date: 2019-05-08 07:25:59
what about 2FA that requires the rotating 6 digits from Google Autheticator/Authy?
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:01:59
i presume they are talking about people transferring country A's fiat to crypto and sending it to someone who lives in country b

I don't know enough to comment on this, but I have friends who are from 'more' authoritarian regimes (mainland China) and the first thing that comes to mind when bitcoin is brought up is a) the possibility of money laundering through BTC and b) autocratic governments shutting down any on and off-ramps to fiat. Sure, eventually people say that BTC will replace fiat, but until that point, the vast majority of financial transactions and everyday life IS conducted in USD or equivalents. It's a chicken or the egg problem.
@_date: 2019-05-08 01:42:49
I don't get it. What's the point of 2FA then?
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:15:03
