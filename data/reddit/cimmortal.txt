I see. I thought people can always buy it on some exchanges with the ration 1 or even lower. Lol

Thanks. This is a reasonable answer to my question.  But If I were Tether company. I would like to do something more profitable instead of just put all money into the bank. At least, it’s a crypto currency company right? Should be more into crypto than fiat. 
In this case, buying Bitcoin would be a better choice. In this case, If customer bought 1 USDT with $1 and use that 1 USDT to buy bitcoin, at the same time, Tether company decided to invest in bitcoin with the paid $1 from customer....it would be a strange situation....I would be afraid if that but Banks in real life do the same thing. They use customers savings to do investment as well. I think both Tether lover and hater have a point.  I am just very curious about what is the business process of Tether company.

Why Bitfinex? As what is showed in the Tether website, Binance holds the most USDT

So how come Bitfinex is not ranked in Top 3 Tether holders? Is it because Bitfinex decided to spend Tether or there is low trading volume on it?

That would be a very good business model then. Low risk and stable profit. Tether might be a genius idea

You are saying that 39% is not enough?

Actually elites created these sentences to convince you to buy high because they already bought the low even before you know what is bitcoin and blockchain. If you are trying to beat the elite or just trying to express yourself you gotta have you own ideas instead of follow and repeat other people’s words.

I don’t usually sell bitcoin, but when I do I make sure it’s right before the bouncing back.

Think about this. Short bitcoin to $4000 is easier than pull it to $16000. Same profitability scale.
