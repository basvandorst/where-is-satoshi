Paxful should use kyc to stop nigerian scammers. I hope they do as I like trading there and met alot of awesome people there. Those guys try and do the right thing and take on the biggest challenges and should be supported.

Great! I learned about it from the paxful article and was convinced! Paxful warns people alot but people dont take security seriously until they get robbed... sad. We all need to protect ourselves better. Things getting crazy!

Seen some really interesting stuff going on  too with some dudes doing some huge otc trades there by exploting a bug in paxful’s offer creation process to go over 10k to over a million and they are buying and selling alot. Dont think paxful is reporting this volume as they cobsider it otc but they have a secret program me thinks!
I remain bullish too much btc action going on behind the scenes!

Lbc and paxful are used by people in underdeveloped countries where bitcoin is growing and the price is still sky high so no surprise to see this. Paxful is huge in africa, maybe too big, lots of nigerians tie up my offers, lbc is big in venezula, both these cos are doing the real work of getting crypto to the ppl who need it most. P2p will only grow and grow while others may shrink hmmmmm..

Nice but paxful still has alot of work to do cleani g up scammers. They should lock em down and ban them seriously coinlockers suck!

U have nothing better to do than rag on these guys helping the poor around the world? Go and spam the exchanges boards instead, they are destroying the space. ��

Great to hear people building real apps for real use cases and real people instead of just speculation traps and vapour ware. Respect for what Paxful is doing in Africa. We need more focus on this instead of the price bs

You should get on paxful. They have tons of atm buyers they could send you. Sure they would love it

You need 2fa now as all the major crypto sites have password crackinng script kiddies now. The paxful ceo even wrote a whole article on this. Your password has def been owned from another site. If you don’t turn on 2fa now... seriously!

No use google authenticator!! Sms can be hacked! Did you even read his article? He wanrs against sms! This is why hacks happen because no on reads and just accuses ppl.  Seriously you made a thread accusing these guys of robbing you and you are not even taking the time to read what they wrote...

Paxful should go to Puerto Rico and do the same they did for those bp ladies, Nigerians and Venezueals, first LISTEN to them and see how they can really help and then educate them on how they can streamline those truly useful p2p finance processes! This is the work no one seems willing to do except the pax guys.. maybe  they can work with Piece here?
