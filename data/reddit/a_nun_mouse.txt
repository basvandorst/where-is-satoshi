First off, I've bought ASIC miners from GAW and have had no issues, and they are still mining.  Worst I had to do was replace one PSU for under $10.  
That said, I never got into Hashlets, I prefer physical miners.  They were the first I knew of to offer them, but now so is Zuesminer and others under their own branding.  The model they're trying isn't far off from software makers these days : don't sell something for a one time cost, make it a subscription model and keep that steady pay coming!  
scammy? redflags?  doesn't seem so far.  Bitcoin and most other coins are tanking in price so of course profitability is down.  And everyone jumped on the bandwagon so Gaw, Zues, and the rest barely offer hardware anymore.  
So lots of people have hate for Gaw.  But they haven't done anything wrong as much as everyone is buying into a new model of "cloud mining".  
So don't blame GAW, Zues, or the rest.  Blame yourself and the rest of the miners who bought into it instead of demanding new hardware.  
Every bit of new hardware I was looking forward to has been systematically cancelled, limited, or withdrawn since cloud mining came into fashion.  KNC titan, Zues Volcano, Gaw vaultbreaker, remember those?  
All gone when they realized they could break them down into snippets of cloud mining.  I can't blame them for doing it either, less hassle, no shipping, and steady pay to compensate for storing, powering, and running the hardware.  
Did I mention I wanted to buy actual hardware still to mine?  I've gone ASIC, but no one is selling new hardware.  
Cloud mining.  
oh yeah, just GAW's fault... sure...
