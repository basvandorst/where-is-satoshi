The free market will sort itself out and automatically de-centralize! /s

Market that has morals = *regulated* free market

Not everyone is a saint, don't completely trust on an exchange that can have full possession of your deposited money. What else could've gone wrong? "Free market" is not run on ethics.

I flipped through your post history and it appears that you are nothing but a manipulative dick trying to sway public opinion with sensational titles and fancy words. Shame on you and all these "libertarians". I believe Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general will eventually grow to become a nice and neat alternative to the existing currency system we have. However believing that cryptocurrencies can topple the existing financial structure is purely delusional and those who do believe in that deserve to lose every single cent of their money invested.

Not saying cops are idiots. They might have heard about bitcon, but having two cops who knew who invented bitcoin to appear at Nakamoto's home is way too convenient for the story, so convenient that it sounds fake.

The US economy is relatively free when compared to PRC's.

Having a scientific education/engineer qualifications != open minded leaders.
Hating on banks is not the solution to a better economy. I'd take free market economy over bureaucratic capitalism any day.

That's set by the company since its beginning. Back then (around '06-'08) some people actually used it to trade things like video game characters and stuff but most of those were within the frame of Tencent's products. There were no ways to prevent scams but I'm not familiar with the situation now.

I'm saying "this thread" is advocating such opinions and you should stop attempting to make it personal. Also by buying "real world currencies" I mean mostly Euro, USD and currencies of other economically advanced nations. Using Yugoslavia as an example is not that convincible because given the history, no one with a brain will think that's profitable or even safe.

Maybe I'm a bit disconnected since I haven't been living in China for 5 years and use QQ for communication only, but back then there were speculations about Qcoin becoming a digital currency. However the conclusion was that the digital currency is controlled by one single company and there were no platform to exchange goods using Qcoin.

Less regulation is on the surface. In reality corruption is so widespread that the economy is essentially controlled by Chinese bureaucrats. I'm not saying the US has "pure" financial freedom, but it's a much more desirable environment than China.

At least real world currencies won't lose near 80% of their value in less than a day. Bitcoin did rebound but it still worths about 50% of its highest price. You don't see that kinds of fluctuations in real world. I do believe that Bitcoin will become more popular once it's stable, but this thread's intention is to persuade Turks to pull all of their money from banks to buy Bitcoins (practicality aside) like nothing could ever go wrong with that.

Looks like a lot of people have already forgotten what happened less than two months ago.

But a crash still means a substantial amount of the investment will be vaporized. I don't see why Turks should put their money in Bitcoins instead of other real world currencies. Bitcoin is not stable yet, advocating others to buy Bitcoins like this thread is doing is no different from scamming.

Yes, it wasn't designed as a digital currency to be used beyond Tencent's own products and services.
