Let me break this to you. If a private key was at any time accessed by more than one party it is not a private key anymore. Sorry about your loss. Keep your private keys private, next time.

Not true. Gox's behaviour was extremely incoherent as early as January 2011. The warnings and red flags were abundant then. With time red flags and warnings only piled up. I, for example, never sent a single satoshi or penny to gox. 
Do not tell us that this came up out of the blue, it did not. It always was a question of when, not if.

Most likely yes. But ask providers of those service to make a clear statement on whether they have fixed it now and more importantly whether they were affected at any point in time.
To be on the safe side secure your bitcoins while all this blows over. Do not trust any 3rd parties. Most of companies in Bitcoin space are run by amateurs who are unable to comprehend the threat and unable to protect their customers. Be extremely careful, trust no one, at least for some time while this all blows over.
@_date: 2014-04-10 00:55:09
Of course they can. They just chosen not to, and the only reason to act like this for a rational actor is because they perceive cost associated with changing DDOS protection service higher than cost associated with fucking up their users.
This vulnerability  separates the boys from the men. Enjoy the stream of mee too announcements from various bitcoin services about them patching they puny websites days after the heartbleed was discovered. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 00:51:45
Can you read? Did I ever said 'avoid sites using openssl' ever? How did you make jump from 'never vulnerable to heartbleed bug' to 'never using sites using openssl'? Logically that would only be possible if you assume that 'all sites using openssl at some point had heartbleed vulnerability'. Which is of course utter noncense. My clients, for example, use openssl and at no point in time were vulnerable to heartbleed bug ever.
Care to respond on this? Can you come up with another logical fallacy or two?
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:26:34
Yep right, lets downwote the most factual and relevant report in this thread related to linked filippo.io website and their 'tests'. Which is actually dead easy to verify independently.
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:47:04
This is probably the worst zero-day vulnerability of the decade if not ever.
I feel very smug here because none of my clients, without any exceptions, were affected. I know it sounds ridiculous, but chances are that among large companies in Bitcoins space, only my clients were not affected by this bug.
Rest of you, do update your openssl lib to 1.0.1g restart your servers. If your system was affected change all keys and passwords and ssl certs. Read  for more. 
Consider pulling all your bitcoins from any 3rd party services you use for time being, while all this blows over. Change all your passwords on varions websites. Once they fix their shit, and get new SSL certs, do change passwords again.
This is a real deal! Be very very careful! Secure your bitcoins!

No. Shitcoins just got even more useless. Colored coins represent a layer of logic build on top of bitcoin blockchain. This makes colored coins very useful. 
The key concept one need to understand here, is that owl-coins and their ilk, while yes utterly useless, are not altcoins. They are assets tracked by colored coins method using Bitcoin blockchain. Yes most of such assets are useless unethical scams, but surely some assets tracked by colored coins will be useful and valuable.

I've tested flippo.io against some websites that I know for a fact are not affected and never were affected. However, 1 out of 5 times flippo.io marks those as vulnerable. Therefore my best guess that flippo.io is not to be trusted and the implementation there simply responds on ~20% of requests as 'vulnerable'.

This is very serious. Most of Bitcoin companies are affected by this. Even if they upgrade to the latest version of openssl 1.0.1g that was released today, it is too late.
Considering importance of information security in Bitcoin industry  I suggest bitcoiners to do the following:
1. Panic.
2. Withdraw all their bitcoins they may have held by 3rd parties to a secure local storage.
3. Change passwords on all important services such as email, instant messaging password managers etc...
4. Otherwise minimise exposure to potential compromises of various online services.
5. If you host any services using ssl/tls such as websites 'secured' by https, check which version of opensll you are running 'openssl version'; See which versions are vulnerable and which are not at  ; If you were vulnerable, immediately update your openssl  to version 1.0.1g, restart the server, change all the keys and passwords, seek professional help.
Now that you are hunkered down, relax, it will all blow over eventually. It is not quite the end of the world.
EDIT: and FFS upvote this and other posts on this topic for visibility. It is a very important issue and all bitcoin services must react appropriately ASAP.

Linux can and often is compromised and rooted. Of course in a lesser degree than Windows. Do not get a false sense of security with Linux. Yes you are a much smaller target but this does not make it unnecessary to follow best practices and have good information security awareness.
Want to be a much smaller target than even linux? Get a hardened install of FreeBSD or OpenBSD (with minimal software set, without X), ensure good physical security and password management. This way you assume by orders of magnitude lower risks than running typical windows and even linux machines.

Fine. For diversification purposes those who turned up with 50%+ of portfolio in BTC, I can see valid reasoning for pushing some money into startups. Did it myself.
But I doubt there were many many investments in last 4 years, aside from asinine pirate-like schemes for those who got extremely lucky, that yielded good return in BTC terms. Yep, quite a few were good in USD terms, but in BTC terms most investments performed poor. With lots of complete wipe-outs. I do not see it changing during the next few years. 
In my perception risk-reward of BTC investments in Bitcoin industry by far worse than simply holding BTC.
