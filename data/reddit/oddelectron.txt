It was -2F yesterday.  Bring on global warming!

I started around 7500.  I bought some for my mom at about 10K.  Haven’t sold any yet.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:34:57
Does your country have a modern economy?  If so, that would kill it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:39:31
Yeah, with all I'm hearing about Intel and Electrum, I'm glad I have a Ledger to transfer my stuff to.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:29:29
Not much difference.  I was secure before I heard of bitcoin.  I have more now than I started with, but not enough to change my status, or my happiness.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:13:40
I expect a slight dip from the uncertainty, followed by an increase after the shutdown ends.  I’m assuming a short shutdown.  If it lasts longer, there might be problems for the whole financial sector, including bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:02:18
My experience has been, whenever I buy, it goes down.  When i sell, it goes up.  If someone knew what I was going to do and did the opposite, they could in fact make money.

A lot of users didn't adopt email in the early 90s.  Most people didn't get online until AOL.
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:00:48
I, OTOH, suck at entering the market.  Everytime I buy, it goes down.  When I sold one coin to buy another, the coin I sold went up and the one I bought went down.  I'm ahead overall by HODLing, but I'd never make it as a daytrader.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:49:00
I don't have advice for getting bitcoin fast (my only experience is with Coinbase, which takes time to verify you), but if you do get your files back, back them up so you don't get in this situation again.
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:44:33
My GF knows I own something called "bitcoin".  She'd never heard of it, and doesn't really give a damn about it.  She thinks it's some form of stock.  She doesn't mind my investing in it, but she doesn't have any interest in it.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:48:17
Wow!  I don't give a FF for Rachel Ray, but it is interesting that bitcoin was mentioned on a non-geeky show like that.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:55:23
He's one end or the other.

Wow, sounds like I got mine just in time!
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:51:41
I assume they can track where my coins went after I took them from coinbase, which IS tied to my identity.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:18:04
Heh!  I don't have a crypto business, I live in an old house in the bad part of town, and I certainly don't have a 10K hot wallet (or even a 10K cold one).  The criminal would be better off taking my laptop.

If I've got my timezones correct, that's a bit less than 3 hours away.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:22:36
I'm in the same boat.  My mom asked me to buy bitcoin for her and she'll reimburse me.  She has zero tech skills, so I'm managing it for her.  The good part is, I don't have to worry about her doing something dumb and losing the money.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:27:41
One of the good things about bitcoin is you don’t have to buy a whole bitcoin.  You can spend whatever amount you’re comfortable with.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:06:26
The fees weren't that high when I put it in bitcoin.  No, I don't need the money now, but I don't want it locked in if I DO need/want to withdraw it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:16:34
Sounds like a good time to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:56:37
The issue of having those zeros on the wrong end is minor.  I’m more concerned about the other two points.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:18:45
Yeah, my bank called me and asked about my recent charges.  I told them they were all legit, and had no problem.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:04
Wow, that was some sneeze!
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:06:19
Exactly!  The problem, IMO, wasn't buying houses, it was buying above their means.  If you're renting, you're paying for someone else's house.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:18:02
About 2013 or 14.  I thought it sounded interesting, but didn't do anything with it.  I tuned out after MtGox.  Nov 17, my mom heard about it on the radio and asked me to look into it.  That got me interested again, and this time I did put something into it, for me and her.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:14:10
I thought I saw 13K, but I blinked and it was "only" 12.9.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:15:10
Does that mean bitcoin is uniting the nation?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:42:20
Because it's not that secure.  If someone steals my phone, there's a chance they could get lucky with the PIN (unlikely, since they'd have to get past 2 of them, but it could happen) and clean out my wallet.  As it stands now, the phone is worth more than the coin in my wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:03:24
Hmm, I'm in the same boat with my mom.  :(
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:26:40
I predict bitcoin will crash to 5K.  I’ll try to get onto Coinbase to buy the dip, but it will go down as I’m trying.  I’ll spend the next few hours yelling at the computer.  By the time coinbase is back, bitcoin will be 30K.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:16:19
You can buy it at one of the bitcoin exchanges.  Coinbase and Gemini are two of the better known exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:26:30
I pray for anyone who falls for it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:35:44
ATL?  ROTFL!  The lowest I saw was still well above what it was in early November.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:49:16
I gave my mom a status report on her bitcoin.  It was significantly higher than last weeks report. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:26:14
For me, it's not how much I have (which is still peanuts), but when I got in.  The 2K dip when I first bought bothered me, but I HODLd.  The latest dip didn't bother me, because it's still a lot higher than when I started.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:22:18
To me, it seems more a case of not carrying vast amounts of money on you.  I wouldn't have 90K of bitcoin on my phone either.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:39:03
"You can not transact $70. That's the reality."
I have a wallet with about $60 in it.  Am I screwed?

If bitcoins are outlawed, only outlaws will have bitcoins.

Unless they bought a house they couldn't really afford (as many did), there's no reason they can't also buy bitcoin.

I'm looking forward to "Bitcoin God" in Xmas.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:43:57
I know a number of people who would "care" about me if they knew I had bitcoin.  Or even if they thought I had a few extra USDs.  :p
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:42:11
Hopefully not.  I think the other posters have a good point.  There's a lot of tax money from bitcoin.  They probably won't ban it as long as they can milk that for all its worth.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:04:11
BTC might crash to 5K and jump to 20K!  In the same day!

It's easier to remember one password than a 12-24 word seed.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:52:14
IMO, it's a matter of control.  In your own wallet, you don't have to worry about CB going down every two minutes.  Or about them going out of business or turning evil.  
OTOH, you're responsible for your wallet, and if you don't write down the keywords and your computer explodes, you're SOL.

I'm not young anymore.  When is "soon"?
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:29:30
I do that for my mom because I know how she is with tech.  But I wouldn't do that for anyone else.  It's the Coinbase situation in reverse, "not really her coins".
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:45:27
The problem with that is it would make it harder for customers with problems to get through.  Though that’s a moot point, since they don’t help customers with real problems anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:21:24
Yippy Kiyay!  :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:12:09
I suspect that if the world's biggest economy outlawed bitcoin, bitcoin would take a pretty big hit.  And haven't both Russia and China been hostile to it?  That's 3 important countries.  Plus, regardless of what effect outlawing bitcoin would have in Europe, it would certainly suck for Americans.  I have a vested interest in that, since I am one of them!  :O
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:57:25
My mom just asked me how "the investment" was doing.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:58:45
I got a phone call from my bank, asking if several recent transactions, including but not limited a few to Coinbase, were legit.  I told them they were.  No problem.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:37:17
Why didn't I buy the dip?  Because Coinbase was down!
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:37:19
It's the reddit version of cyber-squatting.  The BCH people are in control of r/btc .
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:52:37
That's the thing.  If I forget my bank password, I CAN get it reset.  If I lose my wallet seed words, I'm SOL.  It's clear which is easier, though admittedly less secure from outside hackers.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:50:32
My mom asked how the bitcoin I'm holding for her was doing.  Better than it was last week, and quite a bit better than when I bought it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:49:56
Even those of us in first-world countries might live in third-world areas.  It's not that unusual to hear about home invasions on the news, and most of those victims don't have 4+ digit amounts of money in their houses.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:18:06
I first bought at just under 7500.  Right after that, it plunged to 5500.  I'm glad I didn't sell.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:48:49
Sounds like a scam to me.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:11:59
My mom heard about it on the radio.  I told her it could go up or down, and she decided on her own to try it with a small amount.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:49:42
I just ordered a Ledger Nano S with bitcoin.  :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:10:46
If I told people what I have, they'd probably set up a GoFundMe page for me.  ;)
Also, I don't care who knows that "OddElectron" has bitcoin, but I keep in mind that it's not impossible to find out that OddElectron is $MyRealName.  Better to keep things quiet.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:45:08
How would an average American get bitcoin in the first place?  If it's outlawed, no Coinbase, Gemini, or Bitcoin ATMs.  And if they had it, it would be hard to sell.  Sure, criminals would still use it, but it would be dead to the average law-abiding person.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:56:37
When I told my mom what her bitcoin value went down to, she made the observation that it was still higher than when she started.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:32:03
Sounds like a ripoff to me.  Unfortunately, possession is 10/10 of the law. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:40:28
My mom knows I have bitcoin, but not how much.  I trust her, but I don't want it to leak to her evil neighbors.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:57:56
15K?  That was so last hour!  :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:51:19
I'm in a similar boat, except it's just my mom.  She's a tech-phobe, she doesn't have a computer, internet, or even a cellphone, so I'm managing her bitcoin and my own.  About all she really knows is that it could go way up or totally crash.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:50:28
My cafeteria at work has a $3 minimum for credit card purchases.  Also the chip card reader is almost as slow as bitcoin.  ;)
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:57:02
I tried to buy at 7K.  By the time my card was verified it was over 7400.  It’s been going down since.  :p
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:05:57
I don’t expect to get rich from bitcoin, but it will be nice to have a lot more than I put into it.  It certainly should beat the puny interest I get in my bank accounts.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:14:49
Frankly, I find it a bit scary either way.  The idea of having my money on my phone (or PC, or even hardware wallet) sounds scary to me.  OTOH, all the talk about Coinbase's lousy customer service also scares me, especially considering the MtGox stuff.
For the time being, I'm putting it on my phone, where at least I'm less dependent on someone else being a idiot or evil.  Time will tell if I get bitten because I'm an idiot.  :p

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:05:57
It would be nice to have a full bitcoin, but I’m still getting as big a percentage increase on what I have.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:01:55
I tried to buy for the first time at 7000.  By the time Coinbase verified my card, it was at 7475.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:32:35
I have two reasons to expect a dip
1.  I think a lot of people will see 10K and decide to cash out.
2.  I bought some last night.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:24:18
No, you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:51:14
I saw it start to dip just before I went to bed.  When I woke up, it was ATH.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:40:15
I just started buying bitcoin.  Coinbase said it could take up to 24 hours to see the verification charges.  It sounds like a slow bank issue rather than a Coinbase issue.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:24:08
"Oh and btw, just a stupid question: but how did you know I own some bitcoins ?? I must have blab my mouth while I was sleeping..."
If you're a normal person, you probably bragged about it on Facebook, under your real name.  ;)
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:11:14
Well, it went from 7000 to nearly 7500 in a day or two.  I don't see any reason it can't hit 8K
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:28:02
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought that when I saw that word.  :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:13:17
My mom doesn’t even have a computer, internet, or a cellphone!  But she heard about bitcoin on the radio, and asked me to research it.  She probably won’t get any, but it’s something that she asked about it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:15:41
So far, the highest I've seen was 9940.  I predict it will hit 9999 today, just to torture me.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:25:51
Well, my amount is peanuts, and I bought recently enough that it's a pretty small dollar increase.  It is, however, a big percent increase in a very short time.  I find that pretty exciting, though I realize that it could stall out or even go down at any time.
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:41:54
With my luck I’d probably end up on Uranus!
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:32:52
"play" with it, is how she phrased it.  She'll want to be sure she can cash out if she buys some bitcoin, and I assume that if she gets comfortable with bitcoin, she'll want to make more purchases.  Presumably somewhat more than $5.  :)
By "manage", I mean that since she doesn't have a computer, cellphone, or a clue on dealing with bitcoin, I'll be handling that stuff.  She'll tell me what she wants done (buy/sell) and I'll do it for her.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:53:28
Other than a few pieces of dirty green paper and some half-rusted metal, most of my USD is also something I can't hold physically.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:12:15
Ok, I just deposited $50 for her.  If she doesn't want to go that high, she just got an early Christmas present.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:31:31
I used my credit card because it's faster.  But I'll have to link my bank account if I want to sell.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:47:41
I find it easier to ignore the vocabulary, and just say "X dollars of bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:54:35
I wish someone had told me that in 2010!
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:21:35
I'm planning to start with bitcoin in the near future, but there's no way I can buy a full bitcoin at today's prices.  It's definitely going to be a small fraction of one.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:15:05
Yeah, there's no way to be sure, but bitcoin might be the MS Windows of cryptocurrency.  In many respects, OS/2, Mac, and Linux were better, but Windows has 90% of the desktop.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:48:22
Same here.  After I bought, it went down about 2000.  But I didn't sell, and it's gone above where I bought it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:32:39
It just hit my milestone.  I bought near an ATH, and before a dip.  Since then, it's gotten above what I paid, but with the fees I paid to buy it and then transfer it out of Coinbase, it was less than what I paid for it.  I just looked in my wallet and for the first time, it's worth more USD than what I paid.  :)
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:42:14
Ugh!  My bank doesn't charge me fees, but it does only pay a percent of a percent interest.  Not very interesting.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:37:36
But, I don't know any unpopular ones.  :(
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:38:26
Credit card.  IIRC, it was about 4 dollars on $100, and I forget what the fee was transferring it to my wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:38:11
I have X dollars of bitcoin.  I have no idea off the top of my head how much btc that is.  It's a lot easier to wrap my head around X dollars than .0007 (or whatever) bitcoins, or 7000000 (or whatever) satochi.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:49:05
What?  They’re not going to fork themselves?
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:57:02
I'd buy in increments.  1 bitcoin is a big chunk of change.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:39:40
It would be nice to have the zeros at the other end, but I doubt that it will happen.  OTOH, the value in USD is still going up, even if the bitcoin zeros are at the wrong end.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:55:12
Unless they're all down.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:22:04
I thought that was the good name for it.  "BCH" makes me think of a female dog.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:25:44
It will probably crash Coinbase again.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:29:08
I’m more annoyed than scared.  I didn’t quite buy at the ATH, but it has been going down since I bought.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:35:49
If you trust her tell her.  If not, why are you married to her?
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:16:35
My mother heard about bitcoin on the radio and asked me to research.  I'm neither encouraging nor discouraging her.  I told her the important part, that she could lose whatever she puts in it or win big.
The last time we talked about it was before I found out about the fork.  I'm not sure how to bring that up, since tech makes her eyes glaze over, but it doesn't really change what I've said.  If she brings it up again before the 16th, I'll recommend she wait a bit.
In a way it's both exciting and scary that bitcoin is big enough for someone like my mom to hear about it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:37:48
Ain't that the truth!  My mom imagined some kind of physical coins!  :p
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:38:30
That's good to know, since I'm an old geezer.  :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:43:38

@_date: 2018-03-06 19:44:37
There are 3 people I trust.  One of them just passed away, and there's reason to think another is less trustworthy than I thought.  The remaining person wouldn't have a clue how to retrieve them, and the person she's likely to ask for help would probably rip her off.  :(  My best plan is just to outlive everyone I know.  :p

I don't think many landlords will be happy when the $600 rent becomes $300.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:39:33
Yeah, I'm not looking forward to telling my mom that her $50/80/40 is now $25.
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:54:54
Heck, I remember when "the web" was something my mom swept off the basement wall.  :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:40:55
Yup, I looked at the price this afternoon and felt like puking.  But it might have just been the hotdog I had for lunch.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:51:16
But, if enough people hodl, maybe my $100 will become 10K.

Never attribute to evil what can be explained by incompetence.

Yeah, but at least the "9" isn't upside down anymore.  :p
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:53:28
Yeah, definitely short lived.  :p
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:33:11
Does that mean we're all fucked?
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:05:10
I prefer the hardware wallets, Trezor and Ledger Nano S.
