I understand that, but I've read where people can mine specific address, I thought this might be related

Is this how people can mine specific services and collect the fees? Like could I just set it to do the satochi dice addresses?

Keep a (real) fake wallet with a couple bucks in it in your back pocket. Keep your real wallet elsewhere. If in this situation, show her the fake wallet and say "here you can have this" and throw it behind her. While she is going to get the fake wallet, run!
