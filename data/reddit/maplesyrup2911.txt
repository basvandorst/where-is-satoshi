Well you didnt explain it that way and if you see idiots behaving like idiots why do you think you need to follow them, You can give me your opinion and I would gladly upvote like I did all other comments, and if you get downvotes by some highschool kids posting 'TO THE MOON, 'HODL' and other quality posts I dont think that should bother any mature/normal person

Do you think it would be good idea to realocate part of my btc funds to altcoins in order to diversify and play it more safe?

well that is definetly mature characteristic of serious community/subreddit... maybe i should create a post 'BTC over 18k!!!!!!!!!!!!' and put some dancing/happy meme

Honestly man im super new as well with all this but i asked similiar question and from my understanding i think its worth sending. I had also little in bitcoin i had around 0.207 btc and transferred them to bread (iOS wallet) and now i have 0.206 (i didnt have coinbase but bitpanda account but they also have killer fees). From my understanding you shouldnt keep your btc on any exchange office, but please also ask around because i might be wrong since like i told you im also very new to all of this.

what if i sold within a year but with small losses? and in theory what would happen if i sell with lets say 10% gain (for example i bought 1000 euro worth btc and sold them for 1100 euro). Do i need to manually file taxes or?

I cant explain much, there are ton's of sources but basicly when the fork happens 2 chains will be created with shared history before the fork. Each of the chains will have its own rules. Coinbase is excahnge office and not a wallet, you dont have access to your private keys meaning you dont have bitcoins at all. You just have 'promise' from exchange office that they should give you that much coins what you have at their account and they decide what to do with the fork and your forked coins. By getting a wallet you can transfer these bitcoins from coinbase to your wallet and control your private keys which are the only way of accessing bitcoins.

Dont expect any specific answers (at sunday 2 PM). I also just got in a month ago when it was (3.5k EUR) but then the next week it dropped to 2.5k EUR so pretty dumb from me even though im currently in plus. No one can predict whats gonna happen next, is this the top and now its dip time or is this just the beginning and we might see 5-6k EUR in a few months but according to current graph value and everything right now btc is almost at its highest price of all time so I wouldnt suggest going in now (again im not financial advisor and I have no idea whats coming next) but i think you should wait for it to drop a bit (how much i dont know, as i said when i bought it, it dipped over 1k euro in 1 week because of china news etc).
