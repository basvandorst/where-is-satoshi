They would have to ban the internet, or even ban the transmission of data. I could send a postcard to another country with my public key on it. Or write it in code, unless you ban communication you can't ban bitcoin.

So you're saying you can't ban it.

Don't see how that applies to banning bitcoin.

I don't see how you can ban people from using it for transactions.
Let's say the govt bans all US companies from accepting bitcoin as payment. A lot of people in the US will still have their bitcoin.
As long as people around the world use bitcoin it has value. People will start using it more for black market purchases. As long as you can send data to another person you can send bitcoin.
They banned drugs too. People didn't magically stop growing weed out of the ground.

What's to stop you from VPN to a non US exchange?

Clearly you're missing the whole point of Bitcoin. It's value is that it is not controlled by any 1 entity. Govt backed currency is the reason bitcoin exists. One day you could be living in this government crypto dystopia and all off of your money could be taken at any point or the value drop to nothing. The value of bitcoin and why it cannot be banned is because thousands of people verify the blockchain ledger with a distributed trustless consensus. The only way to ban bitcoin would be to destroy it. The only way to do that is take every computer that runs a node offline.

People will always want bitcoin over a government crypto.
Now were talking about decentralization of currency.
Would you be OK with the government having a database of every purchase you make?
