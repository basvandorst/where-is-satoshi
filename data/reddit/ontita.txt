Two opportunities here; one that I live with every day... anyone who has been to Nairobi will not miss our colourful Matatu. Sponsoring a Matatu, or 5 of them plying different routes and emblazoned with bitcoin regalia would hit the mainstream media pap, while also turning a profit.
The other opportunity: Sponsor a proposed international college within Arusha, Tanzania. The grooundwork is ready, the government is ready too, see if you guys can beat IFC to the line.

Is this job still available? Please do PM me if true.

Not necessarily... MPESA could easily be sidestepped by cheap Chinese feature phones pre-programmed with a bitcoin wallet...

From the Horse's Fingers: We are happy and grateful for the attention and exposure. While its a challenge to convert Bitcoin into our fiat, I find the use of bitcoin to purchase services online to be very convenient. Part of our service offering is to resell web hosting, and since namecheap.com accepts bitcoin, Bitcoin seems to be something good. Meanwhile, we are ready to work for bitcoin.

Hi, the company is real, we do not really get that much business/attention from the website and thus its more or less a placeholder. But if you got work for us, we deliver.

Been wondering about Kipochi.com, I kept a few uBitcoins there hoping to test the cashing out system but it did not work, tried to contact its creators via twitter without success. Guess the way forward would be to pull in a sizable crowd, such that the transfer of bitcoins can flow along with the transfer of mobile cash... that would be somewhat of a crowd exchange.

Alright. I tried discussing this on another forum (bitbiz.io) and there was this mindset that most African's are corrupt, and thus we move about with a low trust reputation hanging over our heads. Is it the case here too?
Meanwhile, please send your BTC address and also create an account at bitbiz.io (50 useful posts about bitcoin a week there, and you earn $10 ... every week.) I'd earn a dollar if you use my referral link.
