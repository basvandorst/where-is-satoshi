I'll have been in the game (stocks for a vast majority, obviously) full time for 20 years come next month .I've done it all except been scammed, fortunately. I keep coming back

I recorded the 24 hour vol on USDT/BTC right after they closed the box.. on JUST that pair alone they are losing like 200k/day in fees. Those 5 mods they had must be worth their weight in gold. Anyone who believes Polo's excuse are out of their fucking minds.

I trade for a living as well and when all the liquidity dries up, whether you used the box yourself or not, you're living is going to be just a little tougher to make.  Trollbox is without a doubt a pain in the ass, but the sad truth is 30,000 of the 50,000 people in there use it to find plays, whether they are pump and dumps or not. You can bet Polo is seeing the pain in their wallet already.

BTC 24 hour volume is already down 15% in less than 10 hours since the trollbox got disabled. You do the math.

And that's just BTC which is big papa. I can't imagine what the alt volumes are down to already.

48ish hours later:
24hr Volume: 29993365.70142269 USDT / 10961.51303119 BTC

In the  9 hours since the trollbox got disabled:
30 mins after the disable:
24hr Volume: 
64469851.79248354 USDT 
23079.83548054 BTC
24 hour BTC volume just now:
24hr Vol: 
 USDT 17605.04196321BTC
in less than 10 hours you can see how much people relied on that box. I can't imagine what the volume is going to be in another 24.
Bad move, Polo.
