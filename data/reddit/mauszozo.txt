With 80% of all possible Bitcoin already mined, why is the current plan to slowly release the remaining 20% over the next 121 years?  Shouldn't there be a tipping point where the artificial difficulty is dropped to 0 and miners switch to earning money through transaction fees?  At the current rate of things, miners will be getting 0.390625 Bitcoins per block in 20 years, and about 2.32831E−8 Bitcoins per block near the year 2140. Will it be worth the effort?
If the block mining network is sustainable with low Bitcoin yield or no yield, why continue with forcing the last few Bitcoins to be slowly released over 121 years?

The difficulty is artificially increasing.  Reducing it would put it back to normal difficulty.  I don't see how that would reduce security.
Currently 657,450 btc are payed out to miners per year.  As difficulty increases it's going to take 56 years to mine enough blocks to get the last 10 btc.  And if you wanted the value of mining those blocks to be worth the same as mining blocks today (with 1 btc = $4400) then 1 btc would have to be worth 4.7 trillion dollars.  And if 1 btc was worth 4.7 Trillion, then 1 Satoshi would be worth $47,244.00 and the total value of all bitcoin would be worth 99.2 Quintilian dollars.
I just feel like earning money through block subsidy is not sustainable.  Why not switch to focusing on earning money through transaction fees?
The other problem with artificial difficulty is the number of transactions that are processed.  With an average of 2500 transactions per block and 144 blocks processed per day, that means about 360,000 bitcoin transactions can be processed per day.  Compare that with 95,000,000 credit card transactions per day in the US, plus 35,000,000 per day in the UK, plus however many for the rest of the world.  The only way Bitcoin can become more than a niche currency is if the mining difficulty is dropped.

Good point.  I don't really keep up on Bitcoin but I keep thinking, if the value of Bitcoin comes from scarcity and the difficulty in mining it, where does the value come from when it's not worth mining?  And if there is value outside of mining, why try and force the value to come from mining?  Why is the artificial difficulty regularly increased and the block output halved every four years?  There's no point in dragging it out for another 121 years if the Bitcoin currency system can be sustained without mining for new Bitcoins.
