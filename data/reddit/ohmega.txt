Is it normal for a wallet key to have about 242 characters, some like ( / + =)?
Because it's still greyed out on the sweep button when I add a single address of the 20 to sweep to.

It shows my balance now but it will not allow me to run a sweep with the private key. It allows me to put it in, but the "sweep" button is greyed out.

That is what I found backed up in my mail, along with a file that is giving me the same long string no matter what I open it with, attched to the email

imported, watching only. still getting "sweep" button greyed out
do I need to add a new wallet to sweep the old BTC address/key to?

I created a new one through Electrum and it gave me 20 addresses?

0.0496 BTC
I added it through Electrum and it shows no balance, and will not allow me to add the wallet key.

I work in the money room of one the world's largest casino. You would not believe how much political nonsense is written on bills. I see at least 10 "NOBAMA 2012" stamped on.

yeah... at double the original price.
