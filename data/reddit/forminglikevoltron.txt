Anyone think this positive growth is sustainable?  I want to say no BUT crypto is becoming increasingly more integrated into our society with public awareness/adoption increasing daily.

Was it difficult to switch from google to Authy on the exchanges? 
@_date: 2018-06-11 05:46:19
So you can connect Authy with all of the exchanges?  I need to look into this if I get a new phone or find my lost phone. Thanks!

NADAQ will surely increase availability/public awareness and in turn demand!  I think this is available as early as June 2018

Maybe 2018 is the year BTC hits under $1k or hits $30k either way i'm holding.
