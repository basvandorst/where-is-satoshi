I'll have to look into that and make sure I'm all good as far as my money stands legally, so far the issue of taxation on what I made just hasn't come up. Only taxes I've payed are sales taxes on the things I've bought with the money.

I've paid taxes on everything I've bought with the money, but on the income itself I've never had an issue. I cashed out and just never had an issue and looked back. Honestly reading these responses I think I might have to schedule a meeting with financial adviser or an attorney to make sure I won't get in trouble down the line.

Prolly would have been good to leave some in but regardless I am more than comfortable. If it ever turns out I would have made double on bitcoin, that's life I guess. I might put some back in but I'm really not to comfortable doing that with my current knowledge of crypto markets. I've gone through $1.2 mil so far on property and other things and plan on investing a good portion of the rest into various trusts and index funds.

I forgot about it probably midway through 2014 then was shocked when I saw on the news that it was skyrocketing in 2017 and just sold it all. I figured I could either hold or sell and decided even if it went up higher I would still be happy with where I was at. Just got really lucky with the timing.

Sold it all toward the end of november 2017

I'd pay the taxes if they came after them. It's just never come up.

Bought in october 2013, sold in november 2017. Taxes were just weren't an issue at the time when it came to crypto. They're still just barely catching up on figuring out how to tax it even now.

Enjoy your doubts, I'm enjoying my jetskis and boat.
