its not about BCH or BTC or the upcoming third fork, its about the change over of who control the BTC mining hardware. By forking out and getting the small players into BCH and the third upcoming fork, what you will get is a drop in third party public mining segment of the overall BTC mining pool whilst get large private companies such as McAfee to control the large segment of mining the origincal BTC core. At the same time you will see an upcoming drop in BTC prices due to the mining difficulty of rising forks such as BCH and the upcoming fork which will draw out players miners in the field to the other fork chains. load balancing of pricing mechanisms behind BTC and lowering it downwards is happening. Sell now. BTC wait for it to consolidate with the BCH movement, due to the increased miner rewards for BCH
