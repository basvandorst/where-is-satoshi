It's totally legal for now, but governments are already working on regulations on that case. But I do not know if regulations would affect the entire world, probably not (?). Which means that it would still be totally fine to keep doing that when being in a country that doesn't want those regulations. And there will be such countrys for sure

IF they can, they will try such thing. Those guys are Hyenas, they not only want the $$$, they want the Dollars AND the Bitcoin. So IF they can, they will short it, try to force a son of a bitch of a dip, get the money and then just buy in.
But personally I do not think they can manipulate it that much. If people could, they would've done it already.

Too bad those guys knew nothing about bitcoin so they didn't get the little "jokes" you put every now or then. You really do have a talent there, you sound entertaining.

I was actually quite happy to have gotten in before it hits 10k
