If you scroll down the linked thread, someone poses this exact question and the answer is "no, but you can have a regular lawsuit with several co-plaintiffs".

I'm not sure you're right.
Let's say we look for 111. Chances of this are (1/3)^2 = 1/9. To get 50%, we have log8/9(0.5) = ~6 trials (That's logarithm base 8/9 of 0.5, no idea how to write that neatly with reddit markup). But this doesn't mean that we have to look at 6*3 = 18 bits to get a 50% chance of finding it. You don't need 6 bits to have two 3bit strings, you only need 4 bits (1101 will be 110 and 101), so you need 5+3 = 8 bits for a 50% chance of finding 111 instead of 18 bits. Or in more general terms, you need (n-1) + x bits to find a string of x length n times.
So on to the example, (1/2)^40 = 9.09 * 10^-13
To have a 50% chance of finding it in a 40 bit string we need to check 762'123'384'786 different strings, so we'd expect a 50% chance of finding it in a 762'123'384'785 + 40 = 762'123'384'825 bit string of random data, which is 709.78 gigabytes

Around 195 on my Geforce 680 GTX.
You can get more than that on ATI cards, check: 
And [this]( is the mining pool I'm currently using, it's pretty much the biggest one I know of. And I personally like PPLNS
[Edit] 
Oh and it's usually kH/s with scrypt based mining ;)

[Some]( argue that it's because Bitcoin wallets are in direct competition to the iOS Passbook.

Basically, you run [mining software]( on your PC or a dedicated mining rig. 
And I you want to have any hope of getting BTC, join a [mining pool]( Lots of them have small guides on how to setup mining software for them.
If you're rich, you buy an [ASIC](

In general, this happens when the page itself is served over HTTPS, but the html source contains resources that are not.
For instance a page that has an image embedded that is served over HTTP instead of HTTPS. But it could also be css files, javascript files, iframes or any other type of resource that can be embedded in a homepage.
It's not bad in and of itself, but as the warning mentions, other can see those files  if they have access to your connection (not the original HTTP page though) and they could potentially edit those files (Inject bad code into JS files, for example).
There's nothing you can do about this, it's up to blockchain.info to serve all embedded content over HTTPS when the main page is sent over HTTPS.

Litecoin is pretty much the best contender to Bitcoin right now.
 It's scrypt based, so no ASICs in the forseeable future, it's already widely adopted in exchanges (though not as much as BTC) and the network difficulty is low enough that you can make a reasonable amount of LTC. 
You won't get rich with them at the moment, but they're one of the most profitable altcoins out there right now. They're around where BTC was 2 years ago and one of the most promising canditates for a contender. 
I started mining them on my desktop last week, just letting it run when I'm home, not all the time, and I've made 0.22 LTC so far, or 1.76$ (LTC rose from around 4$ to around 8$ in the past 2-3 days).

Welcome to the team, then! :)
I just calculated some and put together a mining rig that should net me around 1.2 Litecoins/day breakeven in 3 months all else being equal.
So if everything goes according to plan I'll be sipping martinis in the carribean in 3 years!

Not sure if it's profitable, 5gH/s doesn't sound like much though, seeing how multiple 1-2 tH/s ASICs will be released soon and there already are lots of three-digit gH/s ASICs on the market.
But it's been a while since I mined BTC, so I don't really know what the profitability is like now (I'm mining Litecoin atm).

Basically [this]( or at least similar parts I could get locally. It seems to still be one of the most cost efficient solutions (Compare Mining Hardware [here]( it's 7950's are outperformed by 7990's but I'm unsure if they're worth the additional cost), even though the article is from april. I think that in itself tells you a lot about litecoin.
Should give an RoI of about 3-6 months if I'm not mistaken, less if LTC rises in value.

To be honest, every purchase outside the US should be applauded. It seems like most of the big sellers are US only (need an US Bank account).
Trying to get some as an European was quite frustrating. In the end I went the VirWox PayPal -&gt; SL -&gt; BTC route, after registering at about 5 major sites only to realise that they just accept US accounts.
Localbitcoins might have been an option but it seems to be based on a lot of trust.
