Her twitter says she's a mum. Here are a few simple steps to engage with influence:
1. Say something positive about her child and how good a job she's done raising the child. *(this will invoke her maternal instincts).* Do not, and I repeat, DO NOT specify the gender. 
2. Then say something nice about how she's inspired you to do xxx *(oh yeah, now you've really softened her up)*
3. BAM, pitch your fucken educative sentence.
Easy peasy.
