While that would help, a block withholding attack leverages hash power more effectively against a malicious pool. An attack of this nature will lower the payout and incentivize miners to look elsewhere. As miners leave the attack becomes even more effective as the payout will lower even further.
This leverages hash power more effectively because a smaller amount of hash power could get a larger amount of hash power to leave a malicious pool.
EDIT: 
Selfish mining is not a block withholding attack, OP is referring to a block withholding attack.
A block withholding attack could even be incentivized by paying miners to broadcast valid block shares to the payer instead of the pool.

Here's some suggested steps to reduce bias:
1. If you are using multiple dice per roll, mark them so you can identify them. This is to prevent you from subconsciously introducing a bias when recording the results.
2. Roll the dice.
3. Record the results. Be sure to record the dice in the same order each time.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have 64 digits on a single line (for a bitcoin private key).
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 until you have however many lines you desire. Line up the characters on each line. More lines will produce less bias.
6. In each column, [XOR]( all the characters and record the result underneath.
7. After XORing all the columns you will have 64 random hex digits with less bias than the source of random digits used to create them.

I also don't like the name.
I suggest naming uBTC after Hal Finney. It follows the convention of naming units after influential individuals in the Bitcoin community.

Shorter block times are less secure. The larger the propagation time is in relation to the block time the easier it is to perform a "51%" attack. The "51%" is in quotes because the same attack would be possible with 40% or 30% given short enough block times.
Forking will be more common and that would also reduce security. Any mining applied to orphaned blocks would be wasted, effectively lowering the total hash rate of the network.


You want to worry about propagation to the vast majority of the miners. If blocks propagated in a timely manner to only 51% of miners then a "51%" attack could be performed with 26% of the mining power.

A typical Bitcoin transaction is less than a kilobyte.  Killing internet access would not be sufficient, especially if you just sever international links.  People could run transaction relay nodes from inside the country that relay transactions to the outside world through alternate means, such as phone lines (a typical modem could send more than a transaction a second) or radio.
Even without the relay nodes people could get their transactions out through a variety of means such as mailing or smuggling letters or sd cards, using cell phones near the border (I heard this is actually done in North Korea), amateur radio and anything else that can send 1 kB.

There are multiple signature schemes that are quantum resistant.
The [Lamport signature scheme]( is a one time signature scheme that is based on hash functions.
The Lamport signatures are pretty large and can be improved using a Winternitz signature scheme.
These one time schemes can be extended to either a pre-computed multiple signature capacity [\(using the Merkle signature scheme\)]( or even an arbitrary amount of signatures.

While both are true it is still preferable to an exchange holding everyone's coins.
In both of those attack scenarios, the attacker wouldn't be able to steal everyone's coins. Word would spread fast of certain attacks so the attack window would be small. If the exchange shuts down people could still be able to recover their coins. 
It is also possible to have a plugin verify javascript or to have an open source desktop client to deal with those concerns.

This is a a very flawed view of Bitcoin's security. Last time I saw this I posted [this comment](to explain the issues. I have included the comment below:
There is a lot wrong with this picture.
None of the 3 cryptographic primitives used by Bitcoin ([SHA-256]( [RIPEMD-160]( [ECDSA]( are proven to be absolutely secure. It is possible that a flaw in these may be discovered.
Even ignoring some possible unknown flaw in the algorithms this picture is using a poor example.  It is assuming a security level of 256 bits, while the actual security level of a Bitcoin address is 128 bits.  Bitcoin does use 256 bit private keys but the security level of ECDSA is equivalent to [half of the key size]( (which is pretty good compared to RSA). 
The Bitcoin system is also not proven to be secure as a whole (even with the assumptions that the cryptographic primitives are ideal).
On a side note I do find the [limits of computation]( to be very interesting.   We could produce similar examples of the difficulty of brute forcing but instead using the maximum speed, minimum energy, or maximum speed per joule.
I also have [this comment](where I go into more detail and do an economic analysis on brute forcing addresses that may interest those interested in Bitcoin's level of security.

It wouldn't affect the proof of work part of mining, so the ASICs would be fine, just the transaction verification side. Full nodes would also be affected.
This change would actually provide more uses for the ASICs (not the current generation as they are not built to do this) since the signature schemes could use the same SHA-256 hash algorithm and the Winternitz scheme requires many hashes per signature (typically in the thousands).

I am talking about a loan based off of an index. Probably one that tries to track some real value.  It wouldn't be denominated in btc, but just use btc as a means of payment.
Lenders giving out these loans based off an index would be converting their btc risk to a counter party risk.  They may miss out on large gains if the value of bitcoin rises but they wouldn't be subjected to losses if the value of bitcoin falls.
Speculators may also use this as an alternative to selling bitcoins. If a speculator believes the value of bitcoins will fall they could use their bitcoins to give out index denominated loans. If they were correct in their bitcoin depreciation and counter party risk expectations they could profit from both their real value interest gains and the effective short position inherit in the loan.

Saving wouldn't necessarily be less risk, but just a different risk.
Savers would be exposed to the volatility of bitcoin.  They could make or lose a lot of money and it's very unlikely the value of their bitcoins wouldn't change much.
A lender would be exposed to the counter party risk of not being paid back, but they wouldn't be exposed to bitcoin gains or losses. They could expect real profit with far more predictability.

No. Lets confuse them further by using an existing, widely used term in the digital world for a digital currency. /s
This "Let's call them bits" idea feels like a scamming or a pump and dump approach. Supporters of this hear people say "Bitcoin is too expensive" and instead of informing people that bitcoins are divisable or realizing what they are usually really saying is "Bitcoin is overvalued and I don't think it would be a profitible investment", they want to trick people into thinking bitcoins became substantially cheaper when its value didn't change at all.
Calling them bits also doesn't work well because people that don't know about Bitcoin's divisibility also haven't heard of calling uBTC bits and if you have to explain it to them you could more easily just tell them bitcoins are divisible.

The legitimate transactions will become scarce as the networks are separated longer.
Any transaction that has a double spend with the main blockchain, or has a coinbase input from the isolated blockchain, will be invalid and cannot be merged into the main blockchain.  Any transaction that has one of these invalid transactions as an input will also be invalid.
Since people are disconnected they won't be able to determine which transactions are valid and avoiding the known invalid transactions will be difficult.  Your average user won't go through the effort.  For these reasons the invalid transactions would likely propagate to a large degree if the networks were separated for too long.

As he mentioned in another comment he is just talking about the variance between block times.  Average times will still be 10 minutes.
I got curious and did the math on a simple example to demonstrate:
Suppose every miner waited 4 minutes after each block to start mining.  Because of the automatic difficulty adjustment, the block times would still be 10 minutes apart, but the expected block discovery time from the start of mining would be 6 minutes.  This will horizontally compress the distribution functions which is why the variance will be less.
The new cumulative distribution function in this case would be 1 - ( e^-(t-4)/6 ) for t &gt;= 4.
So the probability of not finding a block in the first 10 minutes would still be 36.7%, but for 20 minutes it would be e^-(20-4)/6 = 6.9% instead of 13.5%.
@_date: 2012-12-13 11:16:23
There will be two main counter acting forces that will affect how long miners keep their machines off after each block.
The longer a miner waits after a block to start mining will increase the bitcoins per joule they get.  This will increase profit greatly if the margins above electricity cost are still small in the future.
However, the longer a miner waits will also lower the total amount of bitcoins per month per mining machine, in effect wasting some of their capital investment.
Miners will optimize individually but I do expect to see temporarily disabling mining to be a common action.

The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks (roughly two weeks).  Miners dropping out for a few minutes to wait for transactions to accumulate won't cause the difficulty to drop to 0.

36.7%, the same as the first ten minutes.
The numbers work from any point after the block since we're dealing with independent events with a constant average rate.  It's similar to if I flipped a fair coin 10 times and got tails.  The probability of the next flip coming up tails would still be 50%.

You are fairly close in your understanding, I'll just make a few corrections.


This is correct.


One key is actually the encryption key and one key is the decryption key.
The encryption key is the public key
The decryption key is the private or secret key.


Close, most signatures are actually the decrypted value of the hash.


Yep, although the user needs to be careful the public key is not compromised, so using one or more third parties to obtain the public key is ideal.




If SHA-256 is used then a collision is very unlikely, as in it should never happen kind of unlikely, assuming a flaw isn't found in the algorithm.


It is amazing. It wasn't until the 70s that public key cryptography was discovered.


The math behind RSA is actually kinda simple (it can be done by hand for small values). Other crypto algorithms are not quite as simple.


When first learned of it, it sounded like magic.


From a math perspective, it appears to be unbreakable in any practical terms but it is still an open problem to determine whether this is actually the case.
Their are side channel attacks that don't attack the math but rather find means to get information through poor implementations.
Their is also quantum computers which would be able to break some signature algorithms but not all of them.


More effort.


It's a means of distributing public keys and authenticating the owners of the public keys in a distributed way.

The 21 million BTC cap is fixed by the protocol. As long as the clients follow the protocol correctly no more than 21 million BTC will ever exist.
The real risk is if the protocol is changed in a way that results in more than 21 million bitcoins to be created. This is not impossible but is probably unlikely that most bitcoin users will accept this (some may not have a choice if there funds are under someone else's control such as with an online wallet).
I often hear people say it is "mathematically impossible" to create more than 21 million bitcoins. I find this very misleading because although the creation rate may be described mathematically as a geometric series it is truly only bounded by human behavior.

A man in the middle attack on a website would not be able to produce a valid signature assuming you have acquired the correct keys and not ones from the man in the middle. This is why it is important to get / verify keys with a third party source. 
Once you have the keys they usually don't change much so if you are updating a client just use the keys you already have and any MITM attack will be easy to notice by the invalid signature.

I prefer looking at Bitcoin address collisions, not private key collisions since multiple private keys could result in the same Bitcoin address, and both could spend the funds.
A 50% chance of a Bitcoin address collision would require 2^80 addresses to be generated.  Using the Bitcoin network hash rate to compare, this would take 2^80 / (2.8*10^15 * 3600* 24 * 365) = 13.7 years.

bitcoind3 is right. A wallet could use the clean and dirty outputs in seperate transactions and not taint their coins.


Miners don't actually modify any data, they just validate and time stamp transactions made and signed by other people in a way that forms a consensus that is difficult to reverse.


It does keep track of where coins came from and where they are going. Look at either blockchain.info or blockexplorer.com to see the transactions and where the coins came from. Although the history of coins is tracked, the blockchain is not tracking individual coins.  The ability to track coins is not as bad as some people say because coins are mixed in a transaction. This is what allows CoinJoin to function without modifying the block chain. This is why coins taint other coins.

Essentially yes.
More specifically it means that the author of the software can make a signature of a particular file and no one would be able to produce a different file that had a valid signature with out the author's private key (just like Bitcoin transactions, which are also based on digital signatures).
So unless the author is signing malicious software or a malicious actor acquired their private key, both of which can be solved by using multiple signature, you should be safe.
All of this rests on assuming you have acquired the correct public keys for the signatures your testing.

I'm pretty sure the relationship is "number of bitcoin addresses in existence" = "number of bitcoin addresses in existence"
I assume you mean there isn't a relationship between number of bitcoins addresses in existence and the total number of bitcoins in existence. Which isn't true, the expected bitcoin value per bitcoin address is "total number of bitcoins" / "total number of bitcoin addresses". In my example I use the inverse of that expected value. Either way is useful for calculating the rewards vs costs of brute forcing bitcoin addresses.  Here is the same example using the expected bitcoin value per bitcoin address:
Expected value in bitcoins per address: 21 * 10^6 / 2^160 = 1.44 * 10^-41 BTC / Address
Expected value at 1 million USD per coin in dollars per address: 1.44 * 10^-41 * 10^6 = 1.44 * 10^-35 USD / Address
Energy to change one bit of an optimally efficient computer at 3 kelvin: 2.87 * 10^-23 J
Addresses countable per kWh: 3.6 * 10^6 / 2.87 * 10^-23 = 1.25 * 10^29 Addresses / kWh
Expected value per kWh: 1.44 * 10^-35 * 1.25 * 10^29 = 1.80 * 10^-6 USD / kWh
The inverse of the expected value per kWh is the same result as I got the previous post: 1 / 1.80 * 10^-6 = 554757.67 kWh / USD
Energy cost to get that dollar through brute forcing at 10 cents per kWh: $55,475.77

This is actually incorrect. The outputs of a transaction spend the coins from a pool of coins from the inputs. If you were to trace back a transaction that had more than one input it would likely lead back to many coinbase transactions. Bitcoins are not serialized like cash. They do not have a single path from their first owner(s) to their final owner.
This is also why treating coins as tainted can be problematic. The coins marked will spread as every output on any transaction with just a single input of tainted coins will be considered tainted.

The blockchain does not track balances per address. It records transactions. Transactions have inputs (where the coins are coming from) and outputs (where the coins are going).

The coins are not serialized. There is no direct link in a transaction between the inputs and outputs. A transaction basically pools inputs and distributes them to the outputs.

Energy to count through all addresses per dollar in kWh: 2^115.74 * 2.87*10^-23 / 3.6 * 10^6 = 554757.67 kWh
Cost at 10 cents per kWh just to count through enough bitcoin addresses (not actually generating them) to earn one dollar with an optimally efficient computer at 3 kelvin: $55,475.67
So from an economic perspective brute forcing addresses wouldn't be practical even with an optimally efficient computer.
Brute forcing addresses however is not the biggest concern from a systemic collapse point of view.  Advances in cryptanalysis in either ECDSA, RIPEMD-160, SHA-256, or the Bitcoin system as a whole are a bigger concern. On an individual level, implementation problems and RNG problems are a bigger concern and has already lead to losses.
ECDSA has the lowest security level right now at 128 bits and is the highest risk in my opinion.  
Breaking RIPEMD-160 or SHA-256 may not enable a practical exploit but could reduce the amount effort required for brute forcing.
For example if the RIPEMD-160 outputs are not uniformly distributed brute forcing would be quicker (even if you didn't know about the lack of uniformity), however an exploit that requires control over the input would not be feasible without an exploit for double-SHA-256.
SHA-256 has the least risk because of how it is used and because it has a higher security level already than the other two algorithms.
I suggest we examine and implement stronger signature algorithms before need them. Especially quantum resistant ones.  It may be much more difficult to upgrade Bitcoin's algorithms in the future.

It looks like the scammer has sock puppets based on the downvoting in this post and especially the downvoting in their post where you called them out.  Your comment and anyone else who called them out got 16 downvotes in less than an hour.

It is a comparison that if a machine was built that could generate Bitcoin addresses and store them in memory at the rate the Bitcoin network performs hashes, it could find a collision in about 13.7 years.
Another way to look at it is that within 13.7 years at the current rate two mining machines will likely generate the same 160 bits in the lower part of two different hash outputs. In practice this will likely happen much sooner than 13.7 years because the increasing power of the Bitcoin network.
For the reason you mention as well as others neither of these should be a concern, but it is interesting to note that the common security level of 80 bits is being challenged by the Bitcoin network. Since mining machines are pretty bare and don't include any significant memory, many attacks would require equipment orders of magnitude more expensive to carry out. However, cryptographers like to be cautious.

This isn't true.  Both the software and the signature could be downloaded from the attacker but the attacker would not be able to produce a valid signature. A valid signature cannot be produced with out the private key used for signing that is associated with the published public key.
From [reading this post]( it seems you are confusing [digital signatures]( with hash functions.

I would agree if it didn't end with:


This implies that the previous statements in the image were referring to the security of Bitcoin.  That statement is also just false.
A better comparison would use either 2^128 or 2^160, which is the difficulty for two different attacks on a bitcoin address.
Counting to 2^128 at room temperature would require a minimum of 10^18 joules according to [Landauer's principle.](
If we used the total power output of the sun, 384*10^24 watts, it would take less than 3 ns of power to count to 2^128.

There is a lot wrong with this picture.
None of the 3 cryptographic primitives used by Bitcoin ([SHA-256]( [RIPEMD-160]( [ECDSA]( are proven to be absolutely secure. It is possible that a flaw in these may be discovered.
Even ignoring some possible unknown flaw in the algorithms this picture is using a poor example.  It is assuming a security level of 256 bits, while the actual security level of a Bitcoin address is 128 bits.  Bitcoin does use 256 bit private keys but the security level of ECDSA is equivalent to [half of the key size]( (which is pretty good compared to RSA). 
The Bitcoin system is also not proven to be secure as a whole (even with the assumptions that the cryptographic primitives are ideal).
On a side note I do find the [limits of computation]( to be very interesting.   We could produce similar examples of the difficulty of brute forcing but instead using the maximum speed, minimum energy, or maximum speed per joule.

You correct that mining relies on a hashing algorithm (SHA-256 specifically) and not any asymmetric crypto.
Quantum computers can break hash algorithms but to a less significant degree. By using [Grover's algorithm]( breaking a hash function still requires an exponential amount of steps, but is equivalent to a hash function of half the bit size. So in this case it would make sense to upgrade to SHA-512 to maintain similar security contraints.

I missed the key for Animazing.  Electrum downloads are signed by either ThomasV or Animazing.
I just added it, so just check if the key you have matches the one above (fingerprint: 9914 864D FC33 499C 6CA2 BEEA 2245 3004 6955 06FD).
