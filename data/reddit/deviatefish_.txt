Everyone who wants the price of bitcoin to go up will advise you to buy bitcoin.
Food for thought.
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:28:59
Eh, clearly this isn't true in every case. Clearly people like to take money and give you nothing in return *slightly* more than they like taking money and giving *something* in return. On the other hand, if you like paying someone extra to give you the same service as everyone else receives, that's also entirely up to you.
Kinda like transaction fees.

Bear in mind that this particular presentation was satire, however reasonable it might seem.
@_date: 2016-01-25 03:54:26
No, but it also means they have vested interest in making the price go up.
People buying bitcoin makes the price go up (very roughly speaking)

I'm in the same boat. Have an idea for a project that uses bitcoin and everything... Haven't gotten past the "starting a node" stage because of all of the volatility, infighting, and general nonsense
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:26:05
This response gives me great comfort in the future of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-25 00:58:50
What if I'm running the clients I need the full node for locally, or at least within the same virtual network as the full node?
And wouldn't supporting encrypted connections to the full node avoid most of these problems? I keep seeing that running SSL is not recommended when making rpc calls, but that seems very counterintuitive.
@_date: 2016-01-25 00:55:58
Jesus fucking Christ, dude.
Why are you bringing block sizes into this? Don't be a fucking asshole, I'm asking a legitimate question about current and *plausible* future scenarios, wherein you're running a full node on a virtual server.
Keep your fucking politics out, kthnx.
Now that that's out of the way...
Can you explain how any of the above scenarios would actually impact cloud hosting providers? Most provide services in any number of countries, and provide the ability to migrate your instance between them. In that light, it's actually more risky to run a node on your own hardware, where you don't have that option should the government (or even your ISP) come down on you.
Furthermore, there is healthy competition between cloud hosting providers. This ensures that nodes running on their infrastructure are roughly balanced between providers, preventing any sort of centralization. This rules out the possibility that one provider is hosting enough nodes to have an impact on the network without having to spend vast amounts of money on it--similar to the economics of preventing a 51% hash power attack.
You're giving me hypotheticals and what-ifs, most of which are implausible, inaccurate, and/or impossible.
Again, what's so bad about running a node on a virtualized server?
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:00:44
Except he responded to most of the points with "well, it works fine for me", or "well, it still works the way it used to."
Neither of those things are valid rebuttals.  You refute arguments with data, not anecdotes.
And the point about miners serving the network... isn't exactly true.  Miners do serve the full nodes, true; but without the miners, transactions on the network don't get confirmed.  So the full nodes need the miners, as well.  If the majority of the miners make a switch to a different client (i.e. classic or w/e), the full nodes will have to switch as well, or their transactions will start taking a long time to verify (because difficulty takes time to adjust)... Which increases the pressure on them to switch to the same client.
"The miners serve the nodes" is one of the biggest half-truth arguments I see slung around here.  It's actually a system that works both ways... which is what makes it so powerful.  To make the argument that "the miners serve the nodes and the nodes control the miners" does a disservice to the capabilities of bitcoin, in general.
@_date: 2016-01-16 02:37:03
Ever hear of a [wire transfer?]( How about, more specifically, one backed by a [real-time gross settlement]( system?
Both are generally more expensive than routine bank transfers... In other words, you pay a higher fee for faster service.
Bitcoin didn't invent any of this shit.

The issue with RBF is that it didn't have "overwhelming consensus", and yet was added to Core anyway.
It's a case of a huge double-standard. Changes that don't go along with Core's vision in the most absolute sense are stonewalled and forced to jump through ridiculous hoops to "prove" that the community wants them.
Things like RBF, Segwit, etc? Anything proposed by Core is automatically accepted, no "proof" required. In some cases, they're not even widely announced, just silently merged. When questioned, the response is the usual "we'll let them vote by deciding to upgrade or not"... This same process, when applied to an alternate client, though, is shut down by calling it an "altcoin"
The double standards are obvious when you compare changes to the protocol proposed by Core to changes proposed by anyone outside of Core, regardless of who or how many people want the change.
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:48:09
Oh that's a good sign at least.
But on the other hand, when you work for a company working on bitcoin-related things, they're going to sell you pretty hard on their particular vision for bitcoin, and that's going to have an impact on your decisions relating to Core work.
The reason why these sort of conflicts of interest are avoided isn't just for monetary/competitive reasons... It's also for social ones. It's hard to maintain an objective vision of something if you're also working with others in a highly subjective version of that vision.
@_date: 2016-01-25 01:19:19
It's still "helping the network", it just doesn't address network-level redundancy.  It still adds redundancy in the sense that it's an additional validator of the network.
It may not provide as much redundancy across all levels as running a node from your home (for example), but it's hardly pointless. 
In fact, given the levels of infrastructure redundancy at a data center, it might even be more resilient than a home node (doesn't go offline with a power outage, automatically comes back online after hardware failure, etc)
@_date: 2016-01-25 09:18:26
And... Why not? The peers my node is connected to are different than the peers another node in the data center are connected to...
So why wouldn't I be able to relay that information?
I don't see your point.
@_date: 2016-01-24 23:45:02
Can you explain why in more detail? I'm not sure I follow...
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:55:12
The irony is that that economic majority really doesn't add any inherent value to bitcoin if they're just planning an exit when the price hits some particular point.
Hoarded coins, or coins leveraged to make money by treating bitcoin like a stock market, are the two worst kinds, in my opinion.
@_date: 2016-01-25 09:21:28
Only if you believe it's a great investment, and believe that others will find it to be a great investment.
It's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, given that its price is largely driven by speculation at this point.
Just look what happens when big names and big publications say it's not a good investment... Suddenly, it becomes less of a good investment. Same thing holds true in the opposite case.
@_date: 2016-01-05 22:49:38
I think you read something into my comment that wasn't there.
I was merely pointing out that it was satire because the guy I was replying to seemed to take it as confirmation of some sort.  Which, of course, was probably me reading something into _his_ statement... :P
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:51:13
I agree that bitcoin is a lot cheaper.  More efficient and easier to use?  Eh, not really, especially not for anyone just starting out.  As a relative newcomer (but have been watching this whole blocksize shitshow for some time prior to diving in), I found it rather inefficient and considerably harder to use than typical banking systems.
There are a few wallets that make this easy(/easier), yes, but not the vast majority.  The barrier to entry is high... And it will never reach the scale that traditional banking systems already have if it keeps being cockblocked by the selfish interests of core developers/fork developers/HODLers/etc.
It's sad, because bitcoin was a system designed to utilize greed as an incentive to do something extraordinary... but in the end, greed is proving to be the more powerful of the two.
Speculators and market manipulators hold the reigns these days.  The biggest common factor I see in nearly everything bitcoin-related all revolves around driving the price of a bitcoin up (and thus benefiting those who hold coins, rather than spend them).  That does not a currency make.
The ones who actually want to make changes in the interests of creating a "world currency" or something more... altruistic are few and far between.
The pummeling it's getting tonight (and all day today), in terms of buying power?  That's well deserved, on all counts.
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:36:52
I have a hard time really taking these statements seriously. In his first answer, he admits there's a clear conflict of interest: he employs several Core developers. Then immediately claims he has no control over Core
Except, of course, that the developers he employs risk losing their employment should they advocate for (much less write code for) changes to Core that would harm Blockstream's goals.
That's pretty much a standard clause in any employment contract.
@_date: 2016-01-25 00:19:30
This... Didn't explain anything. Thanks, though?
To explain... Sure, I might not have privacy, but I'm just running a full node. The only thing it's doing is propagating blocks and verifying them, thus adding a vote of confidence in their integrity.
Even if a reasonable portion of nodes (say even an extreme number, like 20%) were hosted by the same cloud provider, there's still no impact of the overall security of the network.
So, again, I don't get what exactly the problem is. I get the theoretical problems, but I don't see how they can manifest in reality.
@_date: 2016-01-25 09:23:02
No thanks. Appreciate the offer, though.
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:03:48
[Satire]( doesn't mean what you apparently think it means.
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:40:39
Yeah, I agree. The fees aspect just isn't as revolutionary as a lot of diehards would like you to believe.
It's a tried and proven system, though, which is probably why it was incorporated into bitcoin by Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-01-05 07:05:46
That was fascinating.

Sometimes it's better to work quietly and make the project implode from "internal strife".  That can then be used for greater effect against those who would follow in that project's footsteps, by pointing to the example and saying "see, it won't work, you just can't defeat human nature" etc etc.
Throwing the banhammer at things tends to just incentivize and validate those with rebellious intent--i.e. makes them think "if they're banning it, it must be a threat!"
Plus, it draws more attention to it than it would otherwise receive, which might end up having the opposite effect.
Reminds me of [another talk]( this one from a long, long time ago.

There are lots of people who have a lot of bitcoin who don't care about bitcoin beyond the price.
They might be an important part of the ecosystem, but you really don't want them driving policy... Because at the end of the day, their most important concern is their own net worth. To them, bitcoin is just a tool for making some of those numbers larger.
@_date: 2017-04-27 21:25:51
He's referring to the ParityTech bitcoin client, not ParityTech the "company" (I don't even know if it is one?)
ParityTech keeps a lot of things from the rest of the Ethereum development ecosystem.  Just go look at their release of their "new" testnet for an excellent example.
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:06:52
I don't think any of those groups want to kill Bitcoin...
They might want to *subjugate* it, though.

All the typical disclaimers apply: verify the code, don't install versions you haven't verified, I take no responsibility for scripts that use this that go off the rails, etc, etc.

And 98% of those "opportunity costs" are both currently hypothetical, and will always be hypothetical.  "Opportunity cost" is a way of rationalizing what *might be*, not objectively analyzing what *is*.
It's also about 80% hindsight bias (SWAG numbers).
And contrary to what you claim, there are risk-free options.  Within Ethereum, PoS is 100% risk free; because any risks to your individual stake are also existential risks to the entire consensus system.  This implies that if any of those risks become reality, the system will be altered to fix them.  Think of something like the DAO happening--but this time actually impacting the core protocol.  You can absolutely guarantee a hard fork to fix the problem will happen, which implies that any stake you lose will be refunded.
So, within the confines of Ethereum, staking as an honest participant is 100% risk free.  You follow the rules, you get paid, and you have no risk of losing your stake.  This is literally how the system is designed to be.  It's built to incentivize apathetic participation, even--It's designed to incentivize the "set it and forget it" mentality, especially due to the opt-out governance.  As long as you run the defaults, you "run with the pack", and thus are the majority by default.  All risks under Casper derive from dissent--so long as you don't dissent, you're safe.
Now, the value of Ethereum may fluctuate over time, sure; but within the scope of the system, staking under Casper is a risk-free investment.  You simply lock away your funds for a period of time, run the defaults, and end up with more ETH than you started with.

Opportunity cost for PoS isn't a real cost, it's a purely hypothetical "cost" that represents the difference in reward between two outcomes.
The fact that you have a risk-free option for making a return on your investment via PoS is already broken enough from an incentives standpoint; no amount of rationalizing that away as "opportunity cost" changes that fact.  I mean, where's the "opportunity cost" argument when people point out that "hodling", over the long term, pays out better than playing the market?  That would seem to be empirical evidence that "opportunity cost" is more or less a myth for the majority of the population, and is even likely negative in a lot of cases.
