I get you're point but those numbers are ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 03:55:37
Well to be fair, the rest of the world is either worse or not much better.

SOPA/PIPA happened during obama's term. I mostly agree with the rest and I think he would have been better than bush... I'm just not convinced that he would have been *a lot* better.

Just checked. capital gains is taxed at half your income tax rate. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:09:01
You only need to pay on *gains.* So if you bought at $100 and bought something for $100 after it went up to $500, you only pay $80 * income tax rate. if you're poor you're rate is probable less than 28%. So that's $22.2. If you wait a year you'll save ~$10. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 04:05:37
I'm pretty sure it's the same in Australia. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 22:01:42
I think the difference is escrow services only do escrow. So they have a bigger incentive to improve their service and cut cost than a larger company where dispute handling is only a 'customer service'. More division of labor means more efficiency and smaller costs. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:47:10
I'm sorry but that's a horrible website. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 04:39:41
nono. Half their income tax rate. The top rate is 45% there so it could be as high as 22.5%. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:02:50
But why do people need a daily payout anyway? Most people are payed monthly and seem completely fine with it. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:38:42
Yes but the only issue is the miners are not acting together. Each have they're own agenda. So there's a sort of tragedy of the commons problem where every miner might assume the rest of network will take care of it. This hasn't been an issue so far though so I'm not worried. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:32:44
We've got better math achievement than Norway and Sweden? 
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:40:55
Hmm. But that's just one question and it mostly has to do with the US being more religious. I was thinking about general intelligence and knowledge. Also all of those countries above the US put together are a small percentage of the world population and not that higher the US population. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 04:40:39
He's right. In the end of the day the total computation power is what secures the network. Diving that into 10 smaller chucks makes no difference. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:10:16
You could sell bitcoin for goods rather than currency. That way even merchant adoption would grow.

How can that kill a company? Why wouldn't they just buy up their own shares?

As others have said, use coinapult or a wallet on your computer (assuming you have one). 
As a side note, I don't know how poor you are so forgive me this sounds ignorant but if you didn't know, the Moto G (a really good android phone) is only $180 off contract and it can be used with any prepaid plan from T-mobile/Virgin mobile etc. Also the Lumia 521 is like $90 off contact if you don't mind windows phone. 
My point is smartphones have gotten way cheaper than they used to be and are not really 'luxury' phones anymore. I really recommend getting a really cheap smartphone the next time you change your phone. It really helps in your day to day life.

You're forgetting capital. They can expand more quickly if they can get capital from a lot of people. I'm not saying buying from cex.io is profitable (it's not). I'm just saying it theoretically can be logical and profitable for both the company and you.

It's hard to get caught but the sentence is pretty large as well so...
@_date: 2014-01-05 23:06:36
It's just huge struggle to comply with. Especially if you run a small business. My uncle struggles through this every year and now Fatca makes it even more draconian. Paying taxes shouldn't be this hard. Also the US and Eritrea are the only countries in the world that even tax citizens living abroad. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 05:00:05
hmm but even the lowest rate is 19%. 19/2 = 9.5%.

I don't understand. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:59:54
haha maybe you should have waited untill this overstock story died down. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:42:18
Or just sell everything and re reimburse customers proportional to how much they had on the exchange. Much more realistic. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 14:59:35
I agree with this. Just because you found one thing you want to buy from a store, doesn't mean there's something else there that you want at a reasonable price. What if there nothing else in the store that interests you? 
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:33:35
This whole thing doesn't make any sense. Why would anyone agree to run a mining rig for some other company? I don't see the benefit at all. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 20:42:24
Yeah I'm pretty sure California spends more than $130m on electricity. But I could be wrong. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 20:46:10
Hardly anything goes towards things that benifit someone making $60k+. Mostly wasteful defense spending, welfare and crappy services that you would never want to use. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:50:48
Yes but it only makes sense for large businesses. They still have the 1% plan for smaller ones.

Why not get rid of the limit and have the miners vote on a minimum transaction fee? I feel like that would be more market oriented.

I agree with him in the sense that not everyone will be able to figure out how to set up their own modem. But anyone capable of setting up a bitcoin node should be able to ethos point.

Because it would backfire. Paying people for promoting their product is done to some extent but it leaves a really bad impression if done in mass ( eg. like Amway does). After a while, no one would believe even your loyal customers let alone the one doing it just for the money. 
@_date: 2013-06-29 19:38:49


Honestly I don't care about XRP. You only need to buy about $2 worth once. And never use them if you don't want to. 


Compared to what? Paypal? wire transfer? The point is its the best way to move fiat around. That's what it was designed to do. Besides a LOT of the code is open source just not 100%. Even if that stays the same, its still better than using other services like Paypal that's near 100% proprietary. 




Why do you say this? The ones I used were Bitstamp and WeExchange... both of which are not controlled by OpenCoin. To my knowledge, anyone can start a gateway. 


@_date: 2013-11-13 07:16:03
I don't really want to bother finding an official source. I know from the fact that people who itemize (some of my family for eg) have to keep all recipients for the itemized items for up to three years because the IRS can audit any of of filings within three years.  If you are audited and you don't have evidence of purchase, you have to pay the full amount of tax plus fines. 
You can look it up yourself if you want.

@_date: 2013-06-28 20:36:32
This is a common misunderstanding of markets. You don't need a majority or even a major proportion of the total market to move it significantly. Markets work at the margins. Even a small fraction of the market is enough to affect it in a real way. 
Not that I'm saying miners alone are causing all the price drop. I'm just saying you're argument about the mined coins being only a small proportion of total trades is not really valid. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:39:39
Yes exactly. And all of the transactions on the smaller chain will be discarded. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:50:43

Yeah but they are doing something illegal. I want to be completely clean when it comes to taxes, specially since I am an immigrant and they don't need much to throw me out and turn my world upside down. Even if they can't catch me I'd rather pay what I legally have to. If there's a legal way to pay less, I'm all for that.

Seriously though. I'm studying CS and some of my 100~ student classes have like 8 women. As I said you're a gem. There really is something about tech and women that just don't mix and I'm not sure what. Plus it's really hard for me to understand because I personally have been fascinated by it since I can remember. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 12:22:30
They can make it work if they integrate with another company like coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:34:25
Wow... how is that become law? That's insane. 
@_date: 2013-07-26 20:36:52
Hmm I agree with you on the fact that fiat does have *some* good qualities. But how is bitcoin corrupt? 
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:03:55
Where's a 17 year old get that much money? :S I'm 20 and I don't have enough spare to buy any more than the pittance that I have. :(
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:47:42


That's not how it works in the US. Here YOU are responsible for evidence, otherwise you're taxed at the full income tax level. 
@_date: 2013-07-14 08:08:05
The spread at coinbase is currently around 2.7% (including all fees) which is less than both methods. This should lower later on with more competition. Also you only have to pay this if you insist on keeping you money in fiat which may not be the case. 
@_date: 2013-06-28 19:22:13
These are voluntary donations right? So why even bother with conversion on your part? If the user pays in bitcoin, the content owner recipes bitcoin. If they pay in fiat nothing changes... Or am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-06-30 20:56:57


I never understand why people say this. How is bitcoin any better for tax evasion than cash? I mean the main way tax evaders are caught is when people see them driving around in Ferris while having "$50000 in income" right? How can Bitcoin ever solve that? I can't think of one way Bitcoin can be used for hiding income that can't be done with cash.

Problem is there really is no good place on earth. 
@_date: 2013-06-25 19:13:54
Yes. The total capital costs + variable costs. Whether mining is done using CPUs, GPUs or ASICs is almost entirely irrelevant.

@_date: 2013-11-04 07:46:33
Well depends on where you are I suppose. If you're in Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal or Cyprus you're probably in a crappy situation. If you're in Switzerland or the UK, it's not that bad. If you're from Germany or the Scandinavian countries, you're pretty well off...
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:25:56
You can stock up on real assets... buy bulk from costco. You can actually save quite a bit. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:56:45
It doesn't work for me. :( Also there should be a way for you to 'watch' the balance + transactions without giving you the full username and password combination. 
@_date: 2013-07-26 07:16:18


A lot of them simply cannot be bought with bitcoin. Many can be but only with a pretty significant markup which is generally enough to ensure the death of the company. 


And go to jail? Now I think your trolling. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:12:30
Huh? 20% should take the majority? What kind of logic is that?

A good government/police force has the duty to stop revolts even if the business did something wrong. The adult way to deal with injustice is courts with a jury of peers with both sides represented fairly not rioting and destroying property. 
You are talking about a completely hypothetical situation at this point that has nothing to do with Cryptsy and this kid. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:04:20
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:50:50
Yeah. Although I guess you could argue those numbers are way too optimistic. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:21:58


I agree with a lot of what you said except this bit. If that were true no one would buy sovereign bonds from the US/UK/Germany etc which all have rates lower than the inflation rate. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:44:18
or cash out slowly. Give yourself a weekly paycheck. Coinbase does that kind of thing.

I think they want to buy it with their allowance. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:20:40
How are you guys doing. Can you do an official update or something/AMA on what's been up the last month or so. I don't know if you have this information available so apologies if you have. I didn't see much on you're website.

Delays in verification. The transaction still goes through instantly.

@_date: 2013-06-27 22:14:04

@_date: 2013-11-24 20:48:27
They also have five times the population. Total GDP is just a number. Per capita GDP is more important. The Chinese won't have the same living standards for a very long time if ever. The Japanese for example never caught up and now the US is growing faster than Japan.

which one's right? seriously...

I'm a college student :/
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:22:41
But it is a small amount for mining a block. Whoever mined the block got 25 BTC as a mining reward but only 0.5~ for the transactions. If what to keep the network secure forever, something has to give. 
@_date: 2013-06-30 21:05:28
I know you're being sarcastic but I'm indian and I have seen with my own eyes how resourceful these people can be... Smartphones are getting cheaper every day and most of these people are already connected to the internet (slow connections but still). In a few year I actually do see them "rushing to buy bitcoins on their smartphones and educating themselves about the ecosystem"

He works closely with regulators though. I doubt he would want to do anything to upset them. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:12:48
This is wrong. Stock are real investments in companies with real assets. They're not like bonds and deposits. It doesn't matter what happens to the dollar, you're stocks are safe. If the dollar crashes then you're stock prices will shoot up to compensate. (Although I think this whole 'crashing' dollar theory is quite unlikely to come true in my opinion)
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:30:12
Or they bought some themselves. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:09:55
Yeah lol. I think the transaction fee is $0.1
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:31:27
They're culturally a lot more closer to the US. But even that's not important as it will very difficult to side with a party that you think is morally wrong. 
This is all only if china and the US will have a major conflict which in reality will never happen as china and the US are the biggest trading partnership in the history of the world. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:09:23
Well 20% should get 20% of the power (assuming equal power to everyone) not more than 50%. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:04:16
Yeah the US is very competitive except in commodities. You forgot cars. It's surprisingly competitive in agriculture.  Also a lot of services like finance and IT. But I suppose that's not production. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:23:52
Or hold on to bitcoin and 10x your money. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:19:08
Or put everything important in dropbox, after encrypting.
@_date: 2013-07-28 21:10:34
Yeah neither do I. But it makes it easier nonetheless. It's easy to walk a mile. But its *easier* to bike a mile. 
Exchanging fiat for bitcoin and the other way is near instant. Also even bitcoin transactions are instant as they are kept off the blockchain until you withdraw to a bitcoin wallet. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:45:34
I think he meant the next highest in the list. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:23:53
But gold has intrinsic value!!! /s
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:23:29
Yeah. Also there's a lot of technophobia. There are still people who complain about 'computers taking their jobs'. Most retailers don't even take credit cards. Its mostly cash only. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:52:37
Actually it wouldn't work with coinbase. Coinbase doesn't put all you're money in one address they have some system of moving it around, storing and distributing it back. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:16:52
Nothin wrong with a little greed. As long as it doesn't consume you. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:31:34
This is actually making me nervous. 
@_date: 2013-07-28 19:14:49


It does make those things faster and easier though. 
@_date: 2013-06-16 04:39:39
Although I do agree with this, I believe hashing power also needs to stay decentralized, not just the mined bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 03:36:29
You can but the amount of money in those addresses have no relation to the amount of money in you're account. At least for me. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:01:12
Yeah but if that's a lot of money for OP, it doesn't make a lot of sense to keep it all in bitcoin. If it's not, then OP can just buy 60 BTC now with 60k. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:15:44


Don't you have bitpay there? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:24:05


Exactly... this is the 'traffic jam' scenario. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:38:30
Why is that funny? :S
@_date: 2013-07-26 20:52:21
This is true only for a few of the world'd fiat currencies. The USD, EUR, JPY, GBP. Almost all the other currencies are subject to pretty huge swings (sure not as much as bitcoin) 
Also most times these swings tend to be in the downward direction never to come back up again. That has happened only once in bitcoin and most people think it'll go back up again. Bitcoins swings tend to be net upwards verses net downwards for most fiat. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:03:31
Dog tags work too!
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:31:26
Yeah but then it becomes very cumbersome to use coinbase to say buy something. You'll have to wait for the email and then confirm. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 12:01:19
If you make very little money and the cost of every meal matters to you, it will automatically become catchy :D
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:15:55
That's partly our governments' fault. I don't know which euro country your from but here in the uk there is a 22% VAT. On top of that income tax and other costs are much higher than the US. I'm here on study abroad and I can tell you that 1$ = 1 gbp here for pretty much *everything*: food, rent, electronics, even a can of coke. Actually for some things like rent its even higher. 
Don't blame companies for what's essentially the governments fault. Their simply working in a market. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:06:21
Funny you're socialist economy sounds like it's more capitalist than our current economy to me. It's all perspective I guess. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 22:26:23
Online wallets like coinbase are really not that bad for small amounts... 
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:00:27
I think most people can accept zero confirmation transactions. At most you'l need for anything under $25,000 is 1 confirmation, so ~10 mins. It would be very hard at today's hash rate to even fake one block and it just wouldn't be worth it for that kind of money. 
Worst case they will just assume the risk or insure against it. I mean I doubt it'g gonna cost more than credit car fraud costs today. Probably magnitudes less in my opinion. And that's not even including fees. 
Also note for deliveries, this is not a problem at all as they generally take more that 20 mins to deliver (more often days). 
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:38:53
Yes it is. Coinbase is purely bitcoin. Coinbase is what reddit uses to sell bitcoin for reddit gold. 
Edit: It's like paypal but for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:29:01
I sort of agree. But with how corrupt India is... it doesn't matter. You can literally move truckloads of gold/currency in broad daylight and no one will dare question it as the authorities are the ones doing it. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 23:32:14
Inflation is always caused by printing money in the end of the day, you're right... It doesn't matter what happens in unemployment etc (at least long term). In fact most of the those things have deflationary effects in the short term which is why the US is in printing mode right now to counterbalance that.

@_date: 2013-07-11 02:24:23
The old can change too. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:11:13
Or if you want to be in the top 1% in America (by bitcoin wealth), ~0.625 BTC = ~$400 on coinbase right now. 
Calculation: 
Net worth of 1%er in america: ~$7M
Net worth of the world: ~$240T
Tot bitcoins: 21M
21M * 7M/240T = 0.625 BTC
My BTC balance: 0.63 and change. Take that you plebeians :D
EDIT: The reasoning is you would have the same share of bitcoin as the share of wealth that a 1%er has today...

@_date: 2013-10-21 02:16:02
Make sure to pay off any debts first unless they're extremely low interest. Like less than 4% low (most private student loans are 6-8%). Remember paying off debt is like a 100% guaranteed investment as they're probably never going to forgive you're debt (even if they do they'll make sure it's quite painful for you). 
So with any extra cash after food, clothing etc: 
1) Invest in yourself. (college, other skills) You're young (I'm assuming). It'll definitely pay off. 
2) PAY OFF DEBTS! (Unless their *very* low interest. Even then make sure you make some payments to make sure you don't hurt your credit rating)
3) Keep some emergency money. Some cash, some more as low risk investments that can be easily withdrawn. 
4) Put some in tax deferred retirement accounts (IRAs etc). This may not be as useful for a college student as your marginal tax rates are probably very low. Still they're fairly good as they're low risk. 
5) Any more cash you have left put in higher risk investments like stock and bitcoins. 
Prioritize in that order (roughly).

@_date: 2013-11-11 21:19:13
Yes they put money in cold storage but there cannot be a 'run on the bank' because they keep 100% reserves. So if you have 10 BTC in your account they have 10 BTC to give you. It just may not be kept in the same wallet that is online.

wow! That's a big wall of text. Yeah I suppose it does make sense in college, but that's what 4 years for the rest of your life in a particular career? Even if it was really that bad (which it isn't), it would be a good deal. Maybe it's just the way it's portrayed but then how come it doesn't affect guys? I wouldn't want to hang out with people who stink. And only a fraction of guys are nerdy like me. How come only women are affected? If anything, guys have more things running against them like the ratio (as I said practically no girls in certain majors). 
Also college isn't just about socializing. The classes, academics, research opportunities, learning new skills are all just as awesome (if not more). Not to mention the career opportunities. Personally even if I wouldn't have made any friends, I wouldn't have done anything else. I can't even imagine just going through college to just write essays on some uninteresting topic. 
It has to be more than just perception, otherwise guys should also be affected by all those things. 
PS: I've never played D&amp;D so I guess, I don't fit in to all the stereotypes :D

Really what you need is some way to spend bitcoins or exchange it for Argentinian fiat. There's nothing you can do about the former and I think for the latter, you're best bet is localbitcoins.

To me capitalism is "do what you want to do as long as you pay the social and economic consequences". The person being booted out would be an example of this. There would be minimal interference by large institutions like governments to this paradigm. Some communities would choose to be more individualistic some more communal. Without any large entity forcing one to be like the other, they would just continue to coexist. This is what I'm talking about. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:47:16

The overhead would be .55% if the seller uses mtgox and insists on converting back to fiat. It'll be double that if both the seller and buyer does the same. But it's near zero if people just stopped using fiat. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:37:54
My favourite is peercoin (after bitcoin of course) for the small predictable long term inflation rate. Also has the potential to become extremely useful, even compared to bitcoin, but not as a currency but for stocks/bonds/DNS/trademarks etc.

Finance is just 8% of the US economy. The US is still the second biggest manufacturer in the world. Also the economies where finance is a big part of pie will still gain a huge amount because of bitcoin as all of that workforce can now be freed and directed to other more useful sectors.

At least in the US... This will be politically difficult to do. Even If it does happen, all countries won't be able to do it at the same time so you can still buy and sell it as they will still provide liquidity. Also even if it becomes illegal everywhere, it will be very difficult to enforce. It'll be like prohibition or piracy, where everybody ignores the law.

I'm from bahrain and am now studying in the US. I told my sister to make a blockchain wallet but didn't tell her that transactions are instant. I told her to look at the balance screen and sent her $1 worth of bitcoins and she was mind blown when she heard the **beep** sound. It was hilarious. :D
Fast forward a few months and she hadn't checked the balance since then (she had basically forgotten). I told her to open the account and she had to dig up the identifier from somewhere and she was annoyed because she was busy. Balance = $8. Again mind == blown :D

I meant you don't have to pay the government to use a TV in the US. If you mean you have to pay for cable, I don't watch cable TV (I just buy/rent whatever I need to watch as I don't watch a lot of TV.) Also pay to use toilets are super rare in the US (I've never seen one). 
Really I was just poking fun but I'm currently in the UK for a short study abroad thing and overall everything is crazy expensive here even compared to say DC (although I am in London so I don't know about other UK cities).

But this is true for any password. Or any thing anybody does in their lifetime. If you drive a car there's *chance* that you may crash. If you cross a road, there's a *chance* that a car may crash into you. At any moment, there's a *chance* that you may be hit by a meteorite. When you open a bank account there is a *chance* that someone may hack into it and take away all your money and there's a *chance* that you may not be reimbursed by the bank. 
In the end of the the day there is no absolute certainty only very close to certainty. The address generation pretty much guarantees a new address to more certainty than most of the things I mentioned.

Just download multibit, create wallet with encryption (password basically) and then store a backup on dropbox or google drive. You don't have to worry about the backup being online as long as you're password is safe. I recommend generating and storing it in lastpass. That way it strong and you won't forget it. Lastpass is secure enough. 
This is secure and unless both you computer and dropbox/google/lastpass screw up at the same time, your coins will be safe.

I can go on but the US may have made some mistakes in it's foreign policy, but it is a democratic republic and most people have more freedoms here than most other countries (except a few like Australia and Canada). 
Australia is still demographically European, based on the common law, a parliamentary democracy which is vastly more like the American system than the Chinese. By culturally I mean they watch American movies, music and tv than Chinese, celebrate western holidays, have western cultural values when it come to things like marriage, parent-child relationships etc etc. All of this is more like the US than China which is really what I am trying to say. 
Also I think china will continue to grow and surpass the US in total GDP but it be a while (if ever) before they will be four times the size of the US. It's easier to grow when you're behind.

Mining pools with higher minimums make less money not more. Think about it... if there are three transactions with fees 1, 2, 3 ubtc, the miner with a minimum lower than 1 ubtc make 6 mbtc while the others make 5 or less. This is one of the reasons for the cap on the number of transactions.

The $1.5B is not real value. Just like $1.5B in cash has no value. It's just a surrogate for what it can *buy*. It will only keep its value as long as people keep exchanging it for other useful goods. As it is the cheapest secure way of exchanging value ever invented... this will probably stay true. And the hope is more people will start accepting it. 
End goal... bitcoin becomes a *significant* player in the currency market, maybe even the major on even replacing some smaller unstable in poorer countries.

Also Namecoin can be used for a LOT more than DNS. It's basically a distributed key-value store. So what you can do is use some namecoins and 'buy' an entry in the blockchain, for ex: aarkling -&gt; my public key, aarkling -&gt; my phone no, googlestock1 -&gt; aarkling or aarkling.com -&gt; 193.x.x.x etc. DNS is just a subset of what can be done with it.

nope even ones like that are quite large economies INR have ~10% inflation. It has lost 40% of its value in the last 5 year relative to the usd, which has itself lost a lot of value. Yes of course its a lot more stable than bitcoin but the thing is its *always* downwards. With bitcoin as long as you didn't buy during one point in April or May, long term your relatively not that worse off. This especially true if you live in a place with a particularly bad money like Argentina or even worse Zimbabwe.

Haha thanks for the CD player story. Brought back a couple of memories. I'll admit I'm not helping with the "nerdy man" stereotype though. I'm as geeky as it gets. Although I don't know where the 'no showering' stereotype comes from. Is that a thing? Also ^I ^like ^^Star ^^Wars ^^and ^^^Star ^^^Trek.
Although, (eventhough I've heard this argument before) I don't know why women (or anyone else) would have to care what other people in the field you're going into look like? What difference does that make what other people do in their spare time? Most of the time people are really just working alone anyway. You can hang out with anyone you want after work so I don't know how that matters enough to make someone change career goals.

Not exactly true. If it gets cheaper miners will simply keep upgrading and the difficulty will increase accordingly. Mining costs will always keep going up as long as miners keep making money. Computing power is irrelevant. 
You're first point is correct though. Also it could be argued that this power is simply a necessary evil. And it really isn't as much as people think it is. even if everyone uses Bitcoin, it will be a fraction of the worls energy usage. Not to mention the heat created could be used for useful purposes in which case the negative effects are near zero.

At 1 MB per block:
~50 GB per year
~1.25 TB per 25 years
I agree it shouldn't be infinite. But most miners today can already handle a lot more that 50GB a year. It should be increased based on the price of storage per gigabyte. I think it can be quadrupled already. Which would mean ~1TB over the next five years.

He didn't say he has $175m personally. He said he has founded companies that *sold* for a *total* of that much. He may have owned only a small fraction fraction of each and also there may have been quite a bit of overlap. 
EG: Sell company 1 for $100m, where share is 10%, start company 2 for $8m, sell for $100m where share is 10%. Sold companies for $200m. Money in pocket = $10m. Of course those number are purely fictional.

Yeah I agree gold has uses. But it's just that if gold were *only* used as a conductor, it's price would be a fraction of what it is today. The main reason for gold's price is it's ability to hold/transfer value among human beings (no one really knows why). 
But I would argue bitcoin has the same properties. It has some uses (public key-value store, scripting, quick payments etc etc). And it has the ability to hold/transfer value effectively. The whole 'intrinsic value' argument is made of straw.

This makes no sense at all. They'll buy at the then market price and sell at the then market price. In the long run, Bitcoins are useless if you don't use them anyway. 
Sure people who buy in today will come out ahead but they deserve that for taking the risk when everybody else was still holding out. It doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things. Even if bitcoin market cap equals that of gold (it quite possibly never will), and these countries hold out untill it reaches that high (even more unlikely), it will be only around 10% of yearly global GDP. That's nothing compared to the benefits it'll give to those countries in terms of ease of trade, and capital flows like investment and remittance.

I don't agree with NSA surveillance but it's nowhere near as consequential as state control of all finance and businesses or the Great Firewall. If you really think corruption is worse in the US, you're the one who is deluded. ( 
Prison rates are mostly due to the drug trade which is much larger in the US. I don't agree with the drug war but the same rules exist in China. It's just that the drug problem is not as large and there is also less enforcement. There are talks of legalization in the US and some states like Colorado have already done it. 
Also there are some cases of property seizure but it mostly local governments and officials abusing power. It's only a problem is a few states and there is an outrage over it. The DEA cannot seize land permanently. They can keep it for evidence until the trial is over. But it's still seen as an outrage. 
Iraq and Afghanistan was a counter-reaction to 9/11 and a big majority of Americans agree it went too far. China hasn't had to deal with anything like that yet and when it does, we'll see what they do.

That's debatable... Still assuming it fully closed source, Are you saying that Paypal is currently better than Ripple? All I'm saying is as a *consumer* of money transmitting services, I've yet to use anything more convenient or cheaper that Ripple (for moving fiat that is).

Yes it's ranked very high in business freedom and investment freedom... even compared to countries like Australia and Canada. I can tell you from my dad's experience that the general business regulations and just moving capital is absolutely easy. 
Don't have any personal experience in starting a financial company whether that would require going through more bureaucracy (it does in almost every country). But most independent studies say its one of the best.

Even if that's true they'll still put you in jail. It's against the law. In the legal world it doesn't matter what's moral, only what's illegal. I happen to think what Edward Snowden did was moral and he should be praised. But according to the government he should be put permanently in jail. 


Any serious business needs to pay for things like legal expenses, office space, utilities, tax and regulatory compliance, most of which are very difficult to pay with bitcoin without paying a significant premium to third parties. Also in the software world, you may have to pay for other things like apis and servers and if the seller doesn't want to take bitcoin, then that's that.

He's 25 years old. It's a lot of money for a 25 year old, even here in america. If he invests that wisely, he won't have to worry about his retirement.

Partly because it's easy for charities to accept bitcoin with no risk while merchant adoption is still quite slow.

The shopify integration is I think the best thing that happened to bit coin after bitpay and coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 03:41:27
Those are good points. I'll add that speculator's try to forecast what the eventual price of something will be and buy it up or sell it off depending on their forecast. Without any speculation Bitcoins are worth nowhere near what they are today. Anyone who buys Bitcoins today (at least people with no intention of using them right away) are 'speculating' that those Bitcoins will be worth more or at least hold its value for the time they keep it. In a way almost everyone who holds bitcoins (or any other commodity) is a speculator.

60k is not a lot of money in the long term and not really life changing. You definitely did the right thing and don't have to worry about 'what might have been' because not much would have changed in the long run anyway.

I think what's going to happen is people will reuse the heat that the asics produce for say heating a building. That's energy you would have used anyway. As for the manufacturing of asics, they are no more wasteful than a general purpose computer dedicated to securing the network in some other way. Most computers are not reused after they are retired anyway.

yeah but what matters is how far from the last difficulty adjustment, the hash rate is. It was above for most of the last few months which is why confirmation times were below the expected 10 min. Now it wen *below* it. Hence the confirmation time is above 10 min. What matters is the hash rate is *in relation* to current difficulty.

Is the gift tax taken from the sender or the recipient. What if the recipient is not a US resident? Also how would the IRS track payments to a restaurant/hotel in germany? 
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:40:08
Well in that logic, in the perspective of someone from the middle ages, someone living today in the US is living in abundance. 


I don't think that's necessarily true. Things may get very cheap, but I think we'll always pay for housing, food, cloths. May a much smaller amount than today for much better quality stuff but we'll still pay.

For a thief, still no as you don't get to decide... the courts do (Although if it's a small amount and you get enough people in a community involved, maybe that's okay). You don't get to unilaterally decide. If it belonged to a dictator I would agree as it would be common knowledge that he is exploiting everyone and he presumably would be in control of the courts/police etc. The important part a jury of peers decide, not just one person.

Businesses did ignore the law during prohibition. Also, it's a hypothetical. This scenario where the whole world unanimously decides that bitcoin should be illegal is practically impossible. It kinda already is in the the US (due to the political system) and germany (due to political sympathies for hard money) and possibly a few other countries too. 
Also if bitcoin continues to grow there will a lot of people and companies and people who has huge vested interests in bitcoin and will act as a big political hedge against any anti bitcoin move.

Yeah but you could spend the same bitcoin on earth and mars and if the next block is mined in mars only the transaction from mars goes through. If its mined on earth only that transaction would go through.

It's actually fairly easy to keep you're PC not compromised as long as you're not a prime target (bitcoin business/guy who openly brags about how many bitcoins he has etc). No one cares about some random guy's dumb laptop. 
Just make sure you don't go to any weird sites and encrypt your wallet with a good password. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:27:52
Well I don't know what your upset about though. Buying a short (I'm assuming that's what you mean by 'leveraged position') is what you would do to stabilize the price during a bubble. It pushes prices *down*. That's why its called 'short selling'. If people stopped doing that, the market would be pushed up even more.
