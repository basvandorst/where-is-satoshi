I don't see how this would be such bad news. China is banning only 3rd party payment processors from bitcoin exchanges.
The situation is exacly the same as for trading gold and silver in China. Here is a quote from Chinese gold and silver regulation law "All gold and silver purchases shall be transacted through the People's Bank of China. No unit or individual shall purchase gold and silver unless authorised or entrusted to do so by the People's Bank of China."
So by banning 3rd party payment processors all the bitcoin exchange traffic is going through Chinese banks which are under the control of People's Bank of China. Chinese regulators are essentially treating bitcoin trading same as gold and silver.
