Windows? Usually a ctrl-c will let you copy a message boxes contents. Then just paste the text somewhere (assuming there is text that is cut off due to window size).

localbitcoins.com - I use bank transfer with escrow. If you're buying, then there is little risk (I've had to message support a couple of times to have them release coins from non-responsive sellers).

I hear you. But if you can re-buy at the same low price with cash, then really you're staying even.

 as a few people have already mentioned. I'll also use google for doing quick conversions e.g. '20 gbp in btc', works great

Bought about 4.5btc worth of the local currency here on localbitcoins.com - still a long way to go before I can spend mostly bitcoin

Chat and withdrawals working again for me.

I'm a big fan of Purse. If you can wait a few days, you should be able to consistently purchase from Amazon with great discounts.

Localbitcoins.com - never had an issue using their escrow service (1% fee for advertiser)

By the time we're pricing things in satoshis the $ symbol probably will be available
