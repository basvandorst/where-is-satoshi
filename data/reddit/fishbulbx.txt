You'd probably be looking at [$50,000/month]( plus installation and maintenance costs. So to be on the safe side, wait until you have about 2 years worth of expenses (about $1,500,000) collected. Also, set aside about $200,000 for the lawyer fees for the class action suit when the money disappears and the sign is never put up.

This is exactly what happens when you pay up front. There is a reason business doesn't work that way.

Do any of your investments involve sending money to a person that has no known name or physical address?

Plus you get 65% pension after 25 years, so this guy would be likely earning at least $72,000 a year for the rest of his life starting at age 45. So conservatively, he'll get about $2,000,000 in retirement payments.

Coin collecting has been around for many years... I doubt any other collectable coins appreciated this quickly.

This hurts my brain... how does a collectible coin from 2011 earn 6 times its value in two years? I have to think this is endemic of the bitcoin community.
