Ah, really? I haven't bought any in months. I did just read they need you to buy Gamestop credit and use that for steam wallet keys. Dang.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:08:38
Sure, but I also just use Gyft and Zeevix to get Steam wallet cards in the meantime.
Edit: Zeevix no longer carries steam cards. Sorry.
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:14:19
good because there are no wisdom cards in M:TG
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:18:46
Hm, did they elaborate on why they had the option gone in the first place?
I love being able to drop a little coin for humble bundles, that way the wife cant yell at me for buying 5 of them in a month.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:28:24
I can't blame valve or lots of other companies for not accepting bitcoin. Too much risk, too much trouble with liquidity. Let Gyft take the risk and reap the reward.

I'm just going to enjoy the Mr. Show meme. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:39:01
I approve of this.

I was actually going to cite this but I thought the comment got too long. Greg's punk manifesto woke me up to realize I could grow up without losing that spirit. Later songs even call out people for becoming punk "fundamentalists".
That would have been over 10 years when that was written (I originally read it when it was published on BRs webpage). Some things change, some stick with you.

In my opinion everything from open-source software, GNU/Linux, to anything p2p is rooted in the same mentality as punk rock and the DIY movement.
It boils down to fuck centralized power and authority. It's the basis  of punk rock even without the music.

1400/mo studio apt, Bay area?
@_date: 2013-04-30 03:32:55
I now completely understand, thank you. I was reading it wrong the whole time.
@_date: 2013-04-30 02:36:51
I'm sure No one cares, but could someone fill me in as to the power usage/cost of such a device?
Assuming 0.135 USD kW/h?
Thanks if you take the time.
@_date: 2013-07-31 14:22:51
Done and done, great bundle this time around.
I think it's very relevant for you to post in this sub and thank Humble Bundle very much for accepting bitcoin.

Somebody get this guy a job writing awful sitcoms.

Tell Gary to get Horse the Band to make a new album.
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:23:20
I think instead we should be attempting to get CCBill to accept bitcoin, not circumvent them.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:27:31
I'll share 30.
@_date: 2013-04-25 18:10:58
That doesn't change it's value. It's a security, like a stock, it has value. You are asking for someone to give you $155.
It's like asking for a share of stock after it goes up to 400 dollars, just because I bought it for less a long time ago.
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:29:27
you do know that 1 BTC is roughly $155 right now right?
@_date: 2013-09-30 18:22:42
As far as I know most if not all adult websites abstract their payment methods by having a company like ccbill handle it. You may want to target them and other payment processors not the sites themselves.

His title is wrong it's not called the humble indie bundle. Thats only when its indie games featured.
@_date: 2013-08-29 15:42:23
Too bad GPU miners don't do crap anymore.
I still think it's great it's getting recognition from major outlets, I'm just worried we're going to get another influx of people thinking they're going to get rich without investment with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:27:44
Man, why does that make it sound so much more delicious?
@_date: 2013-07-27 16:39:00
Just bought a few steam games using gyft and zeevex. All from my phone.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:06:56
I'll be there buying alongside them.
