Guys I would BUY NOW. You May never have a chance to buy again this low. EVER. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:06:50
Could see 12k today LOL
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:27:16
Full on nose dive now.
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:15:41
gdax non stop nothing but buy orders coming in lol.
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:55:03
Yea or the new Bitcoin private
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:13:23
I guarantee Bitcoin breaks 10k+ plus today and does it easily.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:59:07
Saw a 50 buy wall right next to a 20 buy wall on gdax and about 2 mins later a massive 70.5 sell wall appears. hmmm.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:04:21
Wow. we may be on our way to testing a new bottom guys.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:53:35
i want to move the market to get an even better entry price.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:57:37
If that support at 7000 falls down like a joke it will be quite scary.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:01:30
We are nose diving to 6500. If support is broken there, then the almighty BTC may be on his last legs (for now). EDIT: Literally as I typed this some real buying volume finally comes in!
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:52:33
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:25:58
don't worry you are but a little sheep.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:01:27
It was only 50 BTC, so not a huge one but was still eaten alive in seconds. Keep in mind, BTC is cheaper on GDAX than other exchanges atm, so it didn't cross 8900 at the time you're thinking.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:58:51
Still want to bet?
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:17:22
Time to smash this massive wall at 9500 guys. Buckle up.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:58:14
Or did you expect to bounce back to 14k by today at noon?
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:21:07
Sorry bro. BTW, I see Bitcoin coming back to 15k+ sooner than you think.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:32:37
Based on upcoming buy walls, 9,000 is about to get ran over again on GDAX
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:26:38
After BTC recovers fully to 14-15k+, people will feel a lot better when the next crash happens and be more likely to hodl.
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:33:59
What everyone should know including the guy who just posted "once it goes to 10k it'll drop like a stone". Just realize that you cannot predict Bitcoin's price based on historical data or any type of technicals. Don't be fooled by previous bitcoin drops/pumps. Each time is new in its own way. We have never had such a massive drop dollar wise speaking, forget about percentages for a second. This is unchartered territory and no one really knows. I'm making a somewhat informed GUESS that it will go up, but in reality no one really knows, especially the people saying it will drop once it reaches X.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:51:27
As a reference point, I prefer the 200 year average.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:43:25
It could be the AI who owns a lot of bitcoin is selling off, or it could be Satoshi finally laundered all his coins and is dumping. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:57:59
Massive amounts of buys being placed on GDAX. The FOMO might be back.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:54:04
Lol his daughter told him she's gonna HODLLL!
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:48:51
Massive buy walls appeared at 8500
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:28:53
We can just play for bragging rights. :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:17:12
You have no idea. You really think their aren't people out there powerful enough to pump and dump something as big as the stock market? Learn some history regarding to where our financial system even really was given its initial foundation. Go look up central bank conspiracy theories, and realize, some of those "conspiracies" are closer to reality than you may think.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:02:47
9000 broken down like a joke on gdax
edit: at this rate we will be back at 10,500 by end of today.
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:49:37
Massive green candles.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:15:22
FOMO FOMO FOMO TIME BOYS
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:54:29
Gear up boys. We just ate some sell walls like they were a fucking joke.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:07:10
US institutions just wanted a cheaper entry. I'm hearing 7500 was that entry. Good luck guys load up!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:33:29
I use 5min
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:31:00
It's over guys. I hope I'm wrong. It would seem that the same central bankers that run the world, have decided that either A. They want to buy in low and control a certain percentage. Or B. They simply are going to kill it slowly yet swiftly. One of those things, I believe, is true.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:05:33
Goodness. These buy walls are getting eaten alive.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:15:23
Good thing we didn't bet! :)

@_date: 2018-02-05 20:29:14
Ever heard of the great depression? Are you saying that wasn't a coordinated dump followed by a coordinated rebuy for pennies on the dollar?
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:08:40
Anything that is traded can be manipulated by people with enough money.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:01:24
All technical analysis points to 9k+ very soon.
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:41:51
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:55:54
we are taking a plunge boys hold ur breath
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:37:59
It honestly feels like the powerful central bankers of the world are using their power to crash the almighty bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:59:52
We got exited on by the 10 percent of people who own 80%. lol JfudingK.. sickest ponzi of all time
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:28:44
/remind in 10 days
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:25:32
Want to bet .1 btc it won't?
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:53:21
The same compounding, snowball like effect we saw on the way down, we could easily see on the way up. Put on your seat belts boys.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:55:05
it's ok it can stand for whatever they want!
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:53:27
You guys should get out of the daily more often. You'd see that the SEC has a bullish look on crypto. For now all crypto is "tethered" to BTC. Down the line, sure, they come up with a FedCoin. But for now this is good news for BTC, expect a surge fueled by FOMO. It will look similar to crash except going in the opposite direction. Stock up boys.
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:51:57
I don't wonder. That's definitely the case.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:45:34
You're owned by money. The government will always have a say. Best to play along with the system instead of this liberal, pathetic rebellious attitude towards government. You will not win, but you can still thrive by playing the game.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:59:36
If it goes that low I don't see it recovering. Depending on the pace of that dip, if it's a sharp "falling rock" type of dip I feel it can go to below the price it costs to mine one. From there who knows, many alts would die and possibly btc as well. I, for one, don't see that happening. I see BTC rising back to 12k-13k a lot quicker than people think.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:14:38
Hilarious nonsense.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:03:54
What happened lugo? You try shorting BTC or something? Probably not, you just jumped on the BTC crash bandwagon and was hoping it would go to 1k. Funny part is, even then you wouldn't buy any.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:50:05
Big whales with inside info regarding the positive outcome of the SEC's statement are buying bulk right now.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:54:32
His daughter will be HODLING!
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:17:46
lmao you guys think it made sense?
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:40:51
Pretty sure big institutions are aware of what it takes to manipulate prices. Just a thought anyway. Another scary thought is what if this was a giant pump n dump, the greatest pump n dump of all time.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:56:32
After this wall at 9100 breaks, it may run its way to 9400-9500 range in very little time.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:43:38
Sells walls starting to get eaten alive in seconds. Thats good news right?
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:27:30
Are you autistic? I hear they struggle with detecting sarcasm.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:38:19
Ok I'll bet BTC won't drop to 7540$.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:31:13
It's starting to feel like a blatant attempt to crash it to a certain unknown price.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:11:08
Sorry guys, everything, at the end of the day has ponzi elements. The TOP whales are dumping the pumped up stock market as we speak. I'm not talking about Bill Gates type whales either, I'm talking bigger.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:00:57
There is nothing that cannot be manipulated if the manipulator has enough money.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:00:51
Lol history huh. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:26:34
The powers that be may want to crash it on superbowl sunday to draw maximum attention and make sure no one ever touches anything but good ole fiat ever again. Lol fUd
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:06:01
Get ready to perhaps test a new floor.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:46:11
Winkelvoss twins tweeted that they just cashed out for now said they will pick a spot to get back in soon.
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:19:54
Yea it does. I guarantee this guy knows more about TA than you know about how to wipe your own ass.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:52:53
It happened on GDAX
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:28:40
Time to battle with this sell wall at 8k then it's off to 9k.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:00:42
It honestly feels like the big boys want a price reset. Doesn't look good boys, hope Im wrong.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:37:07
Strong support at 8250 for now.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:51:03
None for now. It's simply too irrational and once again these are unchartered waters. This is 2018 and the dynamics at play + dollar amount swing downwards in terms of market cap are impossible to use to extrapolate upon to come up with a meaningful prediction. A broken clock is right twice a day so take your best guess. Not everything is predictable, let alone something as unprecedented, young, and irrational as Bitcoin. For the record, I'm bullish on BTC in 2018.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:52:30
In all seriousness, I think MSM/Banksters wanted to devalue bitcoin a bit and spread fud. They didn't want to kill it but they accidentally may have. As i've said, based on quadratic fibunachi spreads and interpolative analysis, a fully supported bottom of about $130-$150 seems to be almost a certainty. From there 11-14k within a matter of days, based on all this data.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:56:02
You're a poor sheep. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:16:09
2 weeks.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:57:44
What are you seeing now that's making you ask that lol? Nothing spectacular happening right now.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:30:52
No it's not. I feel that's exactly what happened.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:21:34
Any chance big institutions are dropping price so they can enter lower? I heard big institutions were going to start trading bitcoin in Feb.
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:53:59
profit taking
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:48:26
Sell wall at 8900 was just eaten alive in seconds.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:34:48
Based on my data, I'm seeing a hard bottom at around $130-$150 from there it would trigger a fibunachi theorized back-door paradigm shift and from there it could go up to like 13 or 14k within a matters of days.
