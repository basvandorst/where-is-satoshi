It's so interesting to see how newcomers are experiencing Bitcoin during these volatile times. Thanks for sharing this!

Just because you can trust one group now doesn't mean you can trust them later. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:53:43
Unless everyone was given a coin each month as universal income.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:45:04
Then you're good to go!
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:53:06
I'm with you on this one. Especially with this replay bullshit.
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:38:36
Everybody's a winner! /s
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:04:12
Ok that makes sense. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:08:43
How do you recommend doing this? After buying from coinbase I realized there's a trail

You lost me at regulation. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:18:39
Bitcoin just dodged a huge attack and you think the price isn't going to be affected?
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:11:05
Yes, make sure to invest with all of your emotions.
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:44:18
Here's a bag of dog shit. Take it, it is now rightfully yours.

You could say that about anything.

Everyone, therefore it won't.

I'm all for people screwing the banks for Bitcoin. It's probably the last step to take before mainstream adoption. Now, if people are pulling out huge loans, buying Bitcoin, and hoping to earn fiat when it's all over then they're sorely mistaken.
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:24:30
What makes you think it'll rapidly keep going up indefinitely?
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:29:45
This guy fucks
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:19:37
I'm talking about fundamentals. If there a bunch of stories of people losing their coins just by transferring them it could drive the price down by the thousands.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:38:15
I feel like this is the case with most people who have gotten in in the past month. In which case, Bitcoin is either in the largest bubble since 2013 and will crash hard in the next coming months when these new people aren't willing to HODL in a 1000 drop scenario or it's going to go up indefinitely until cash is obsolete in most countries. Or both. 
Edit to answer your question: We used gold as currency because it was scarce and pretty. We used cash because it was easier to store and transfer than gold. Now we use Bitcoin because it has what gold and cash had but doesn't have the government and big banks involved. It's also even easier to store and transfer. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:35:37
The only problem with this is conversion. Lets say I have .14956 BTC. I guess I could say I have .15 BTC but how do I quickly explain many bits I have without having to add zeros and move the decimal? Unless exchanges and wallets adopt this I feel like it'll be difficult to change.
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:41:50
I definitely agree. I'm actually one of the crazy ones who is planning to go all crypto but im trying to play devils advocate as it is an interesting thought
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:58:55
Ya I had to buy more to justify my ledger. Definitely worth it for now. I hope they end making a smartphone hardware wallet someday
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:23:28
Exact reason why I don't use GDAX anymore. BUT COINBASE FEES! Just give me my damn BTC and take my trash dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:26:29
I'm usually happy when it goes down because I can buy the dip and happy when it goes up cause I'm making a return on my investment. C'mon man be optimistic about all of this!
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:39:42
I agree. Take a look at all of the huge companies involved in Bitcoin. I guess when bitcoin crashes theyre just gonna vanish with all the mining rigs!

Takes over a week to get money into GDAX meanwhile Bitcoin jumps 20% then you finally get your funds and none of your limit orders are going off because it keeps going up and down and up and down. You have to keep cancelling the order then changing it, etc.
Just give me the goddamn fees and my Bitcoin so I can GTFO. Hate exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:45:51
Can you elaborate a bit? If Bitcoin shouldn't be used as money then what will? I'm done with the dollar and I sure as hell don't want to use credit.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:26:32
Any site? Careful. Lots of sites would love to make you a wallet.

Don't leverage? How about don't trade! Buy it because it's a great technology.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:04:33
Why is this argument all over the forums now. Yes we don't go around spending gold on coffee because we have credit cards. There was a time where we actually did spend gold for coffee. Now, we spend cash/credit. Eventually, we will spend crypto. It will replace the dollar because its not a commodity.

You're gonna feel even worse 6 months from now.

Andreas claims to be all in Bitcoin (or maybe crypto) and seems to be doing fine. I think he even uses the shift card. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:36:40
Actually you don't want to move them after the fork. That's exactly what compromises it. The transactions are very similar for both blockchains preceding a fork and can be mimiced because of this. The longer you wait after the fork to move around coins the better.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:07:08
You're one of the few. Last big dip from 1k to 200 stayed that way for 2 yrs.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:43:17
You couldn't be more correct. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:06:45
You realize those 9000 memes are going to attract the entire internet to Bitcoin right?

Sadly the most disgusting thing about that story is his mole

This seems negative but it's actually what he wanted. Stop thanking him and start using the technology more.

I definitely think there will be a correction but what I'm advising is to not give into the fear.

That's not how it works. No one can mess with mining. Nothing changes with the way coins are mined. However, internet / electrical companies can affect Bitcoin by raising the price of their services. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:10:26
It's not gambling. Right now Bitcoin is a technology. Is buying a smartphone gambling? I believe in Android's future so I bought a Google pixel. Did I gamble? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:13:09
It's still bad

If you sell/transfer your newly copied B2X coins, as most will, you risk losing your original version of those coins.

Using BTC is the purpose of BTC. Not investing in it to sell it for dollars.

Unless you're done with the banks ;)
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:11:22
The difference between Coinbase and a personal wallet is perhaps the most important aspect of Bitcoin. If the keys to your Bitcoins are on Coinbase then they belong to Coinbase. If the keys to your Bitcoin are in a wallet then they belong to you.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:46:21
If you sell/MOVE ur B2X, which is in a way a copy of your BTC, you risk losing your BTC to hackers.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:27:14
Good question. I want to be able to put in cash and take BTC without using identity
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:00:43
Let's also assume Timmy owes an enormous amount of Bitcoin to his crack dealer. Timmy thought he could to use his Bitcoin to make money by flipping some quality powder to all of his classmates. Instead, he ends up going to jail for attempting to rob a bank for some extra crack money. 
In other words, don't do drugs guys. Just HODL.

Regulations wont kill BTC but can affect usage. Most investors panic and sell in that situation but there's always going to be users.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:13:17
Your title literally says A pattern invest more! Dunce.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:28:59
Actually you need their permission. Welcome to Bitcoin, where you're the bank. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:26:28
Can you explain transaction fees a little bit? How/when are these paid out to the miners?
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:22:39
If you don't want to answer a question on Reddit just do what normal people do and don't answer it. I don't see the point in clicking a post just to tell the person to go search for the answer. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:26:21

Bitcoin, the new universal currency!
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:50:34
By selling Bitcoin one could argue you're investing in the US dollar (or whatever currency you choose to sell for). In either case... you're a traitor!
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:51:52
Im sure it happens all the time. Also you have to trust the app company whereas with a hardware wallet you just have to trust the hardware

Mobile wallets sound nice until you lose your coins to a hacker/virus. I wish they weren't so risky it'd be very convenient to hold my coin on my phone

Are you that much of a jerk that you'd rather spend time telling me to go search for it rather than answer a simple question? Or maybe you're the lazy one. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:31:28
Best answer. GDAX is pretty inconvenient for people who just want to buy it real quick and hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:13:36
Miners get paid fees? When does this occur? I always thought they were paid in blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:29:54
That sounds promising. I guess I've just heard a lot of risks come along with smartphone wallets.
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:55:39
Can you explain what it is exactly?
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:43:04
I see. Ok well the nano seems great, if only it was usb c!
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:14:12
I just xfered 1000 in hopes for a big dip in November. Not sure if it'll happen or when my USD will become available but we'll see.

It could very well be the best way of saving if it becomes mainstream and easy to use
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:56:29
I'd have to go to your house to yell at a television. Don't have one.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:35:58
Can you elaborate on the s curve?
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:55:04
Won't that software create a possible security hole? If the computer, device, or network I use to create the phrase is tampered with it could be traced
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:17:41
How do I do that?
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:24:46
Maybe you should invest in it and stop trading it
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:27:44
Maybe others would like to shop there as well. Business idea?
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:00:16
Buy low, use it as currency. Fixed it for you.
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:28:16
Who said anything about barter? Do you barter with dollars?
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:42:11
So in other words, i can transact freely with my legacy BTC without risking them as long as I don't touch the new forked coin?
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:20:09
Awesome answer thank you. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:53:10
It's showing fees. Can you explain a little?
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:37:19
The sooner the better. There's a lot of comfort that comes with holding the keys to your coin in your hands.
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:56:55
You're a douche. How's that for an analysis?
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:34:25
Ya, like anyone's gonna sell it for cash.

What is setting up a full node? I've been hearing this a lot but still don't understand

Any new coin created after the fork of the true Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:01:25
Is Google voice still useful nowadays? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:25:57
Isn't this risky? After transferring the Bitcoin they could just run like hell.
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:49:55
Oh so if miners start a new node that is unrecognised by the rest then it'll be discarded but if they all start a new node it's the new blockchain?
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:24:43
Users or miners? I understand that a fork creates a new coin but the coin is worthless if no one puts value to it 
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:16:08
This post can fix a lot of problems in people's lives.
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:06:05

Can you ELI5? Is this a necessary component?
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:20:18
So there's a 3rd party involved? Doesn't seem much different from coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:32:28
Does the price fluctuation matter if I'm just holding it? I usually am just sending coins to myself.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:27:54
But it is if you need MORE money. Amirite?!
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:53:07

What is the risk of immediately dumping the new shitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:48:39
So a miners is continuously paid in fees and then sometimes hits a block and is paid in coins (or a fraction if in amining pool)?
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:32:06
Interested in these answers as well.
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:44:19
So running a full node is like mining except you don't get any of the coins from mining a block but instead you are paid in possible transaction fees because you are essentially doing what a minor does without actually mine in coins?
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:54:04
Can someone explain this? I didn't know transactions between the ledger cost money. Just purchased one through Amazon.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:26:32
What are the fees of adding funds to coinbase with a cc? Also, is it instant?
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:24:30
I just picture these things running around the street knocking people over. RoboCops.
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:24:09
Is this recommended over a 'brain' wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:51:25
So each type of coin (ether, LTC, etc) has a separate blockchain?
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:47:17
I just saw that but it's in Euro or Bitcoin. Also would be twice the price as Amazon 
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:38:26
If there's a team who can change the rule of bitcoins through a soft update then how can it be decentralized?
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:35:25
So how do I choose the slowest transaction rate possible? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:15:37
Id bet some coin that he has a guy working on the timing of that as we speak

LIMIIIIIT !
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:11:08
What if I don't even bother forking my coins and just stick with the legacy Bitcoin? I don't need the shitcoin especially if it risks my bitcoin.

I just like that he's knowledgeable of the subject whereas most CEOs of these companies would've said something along the lines of Bitcoin is a bubble! Tulips! Criminals!

Is there a secure smart phone wallet / alternative so I don't have to carry around a ledger nano? I travel a lot and only have a smart phone so I'm trying to reduce the amount of things I carry with me.

Person to person is what takes away the corruption. If we have to go through some kind of centralized entity then there will always be corruption and less and less freedom over time. I argue it's the most important aspect of Bitcoin.

Everyone here seems to claim they don't sleep anymore and constantly are checking prices. I think you're in this for the wrong reason. Start investing in it and treating it as our future currency. You don't need to check what it's worth in US dollars. If anything you should be constantly checking if more businesses are accepting it as payments.

How do you avoid fees? I'm using the Coinbase app and the fees are ridiculous.

I thought miners were only paid when they got a block. Do miners get paid continuously in fees as well? How is this split up?

What about creating the system and accessing it? Are their any inconveniences or downsides?

Yes
