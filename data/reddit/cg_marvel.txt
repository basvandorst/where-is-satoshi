Why? Such a hard fork could be rolled out together with other hardforking features. It's not like hard forks are inherently bad contrary to what Core wants you to believe. Old, outdated nodes do not give the network a lot of value since they are no longer fully validating the chain. So a hardfork from time to time to clear all the soft-forked old nodes is actually beneficial!

I agree with your feeling that the conference is geared towards small blocks. However, note that Jonathan Toomim should be able to give an excellent representation of BIP101 and XT. Just read this excellent conversation:

Alright. So why are the temporary costs higher then?
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:30:41
I would rephrase this to "major temporary costs against minor permanent benefits".
Also, this could have been implemented differently where RBF transactions would be a new transaction type (would get rid of cost  That would probably require a hard fork, but it would also be the proper way to roll out such a change.

It seems to be Core's overall strategy to give users the tools to outbid themselves in an artificially constrained system.

It exposes Core's inability to make sensible changes to bitcoin that help the ecosystem and most importantly: users.

Good point.
I just hope that if BIP 101 does get major support that all opposing parties will be professional about it and not resort to DDOS and other attacks (like censorship _hint_).
Also, it would be interesting to know if RBF was asked for by a single exchange (since exchanges seem to have the best use case for RBF).

Good point. If we had stuff like LN widely deployed and used by the majority of payment processors, this would not be a big issue since the costs would have a lot less weight.

"MikeCoin"?? LOL - looks like this subreddit has a heavy slant.

Is opt-in RBF compatible with existing wallet software?
Meaning: Will opt-in RBF show up as a regular transaction, or will it not show up at all? Because if it does show up as regular, you are opening a big door for fraud as outdated software can easily be tricked if people accept 0-conf transactions. Not that people should rely on 0-conf, but maybe there should be a way to invalidate these transactions for old wallet software.
Also: I like how you admitted indirectly that a low blocksize limit may increase miner centralisation ;) I don't get how RBF is relevant here, though.

From the perspective of the Bitcoin Core wallet, if the default setting is RBF on, RBF is opt-out meaning that you have to deactivate it on a transaction. That's what I meant. Also, making it default has not been merged, but I think the chances are high that in the long run it will.

Greetings from the low blocksize limit. Which despite r/bitcoin's delusions now actually increases centralisation.
Oh but wait, this is good right. Let's have every miner create their own centralized payment system where they can charge their own fees while completely disregarding the fees of the main bitcoin network. Let a centralized miner payment services fee market develop. /s
When do the core developers wake up?

I think this needs to be released with more care. On one hand, you refuse to make a sensible block size increase. On the other, you want to just implement this change "in a few weeks" that can open the door to double spending on old wallet software.
This also highlights the flawed way of doing changes like these with a soft fork. I think a change like this needs to be deployed via a hardfork so that old wallet software can no longer be used (and therefore, no chance for fraud)! Or alternatively, make these RBF transactions invalid for old wallets somehow..
