I got mine by using Gyft to get a amazon gift card.

Yeah in 3-5 more business days? I swear i have heard that line for almost a solid month now.
I placed a order on the 1st of the month and after waiting until the 13th for it to be shipped i attempted to have it cancelled. I was told i would have to wait 3-5 business days and i would receive my refund.
Fast forward to the 17th and to my surprise the item was shipped and i was informed i would now have to wait for it to arrive and refuse delivery. It finally arrived back yesterday and i was informed i would have to wait 2-3 more business days for processing and then 3-5 more business days on top of that to get my money back.
Funniest part is the day i cancelled it i went to Newegg and had the same part at my house in 3 days even with their slowest free shipping option.

Yeah i have been blowing all my mining profits on computer parts for me and various family members this way until a company with actual customer support starts to take them. 
[Hurry up Newegg](

For some of us in rural areas localbitcoins is not a viable option unless we want to pay ridiculous markups.
Cashnitocoins: Sell  807.596
Localbitcoins: No in person sellers and cheapest online option 834.94

Yeah lesson learned i haven't used them in years since they moved from actual deals to all rebates. But i was in the market for a tower and they had the NZXT Source 220 on sale.

I have several BE's and U1's happily hashing together on my pi with it. I don't know if  LCD display works however as i do not have one.

You could get a Amazon gift card via Gyft with your coins and not have to deal with Tiger's disgustingly horrible customer service.

Wow talk about timing i just got some coins Monday from them to buy a couple antminer's by depositing at a Wells Fargo. 
On the top of their page now

So god damn true i have been fighting with them for almost a solid month now to get a refund on a order they decided to never ship. As much as i am glad to see another retailer accept Bitcoin don't be surprised when you end up in customer support limbo.
@_date: 2014-01-25 15:02:30
Nah it was a NZXT Source 220 i didn't get disconnects but i got the i will put in a request to find out the status and we will email you back only they never did.
@_date: 2014-01-25 13:34:36
Sure i will send it over. Yeah it does suck because it was for a computer tower the very last part of my new computer i was building. 
For weeks all my new parts just sat there taunting me as i was stuck on my old dinosaur setup.
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:25:23
This person is your best shot of getting anything done. After a month of being given the runaround from customer support on a order they was able to finally get me a refund.
They should just give you a raise and let you also do customer support on the side and fire the rest of those incompetent idiots.

I dunno if it still is but it was started by a redditor named wil. This week was my first time using it in a while and it seems to have changed not for the better their online support kept saying weird company names and didn't seem to know who he was when i was trying to ask a question.
Yeah i was pleasantly surprised banks were still letting them use cash deposits. After reading about Chase the other day this is not suprising.

I see a new unconfirmed transaction here's hoping :)
Edit: Finally got my coins hope y'all do also.

As someone who exclusively uses Walmart to pay them i also have 300 sitting in limbo. Zipzap processed my money four days ago to them and it is sitting collecting dust as they continue to hold a lot of peoples money hostage.
@_date: 2013-03-08 22:18:09
Come join the rest of us who also have our money in limbo they got 300 of mine collecting dust with one copy paste support email like yours.
@_date: 2013-03-06 10:24:13
Yeah was up for a little while yesterday me and others took advantage only to have our payments all go into limbo. So i am guessing they pulled it offline until it actually works.
@_date: 2013-03-09 21:52:17
Thanks i was getting annoyed trying to find someone to actually help me here's hoping i see my money before next week...

I would refer you to the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006.




I would advise against it but if you insist i will leave you with this
