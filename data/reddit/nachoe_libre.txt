Im drunk and I don't really know much about bitcoin at all. Basically just wanna purchase something for around a tenner with bitcoin to test something out, and if it works then maybe more

It's not propaganda? It's a QUESTION because I genuinely don't know much about it:| I am a 'noob' at this so I asked, wasn't spreading any sort of message whatsoever. But I'm sure you're not that much of a prick to get heated over something you didn't even read/understand properly:)

You realise this is making YOU sound like the ignorant one for talking about the news out of nowhere as if I believe everything I hear when I never made any actual claims (or heard anything about this from the news) yet being the tool you are you're desperately trying to make a point of it? Anywho, I have better things to do with my day so please continue to comment on this if it helps make your life more fulfilling but I won't be responding sadly, ✌️

Lol if you're tryina claim I believe something just coz it's written somewhere then LOL. The irony of this being on a Reddit post where im asking thousands of people who know more about it than me to clarify whether it's true or not and how it even works. Again, it was a question, not a statement :) didn't state anything as fact. But seeing as a clear educated person such as yourself knows way better than me, maybe questions actually are statements - in that's case here's one for you: fuck off?
