"But if it’s something that stabilizes in the future and is a better currency, then we’ll certainly support that."
How would they "support" that? Won't PayPal no longer serve a purpose by the time bitcoin becomes legitimate?

With the price of many cryptocurrencies down 70&amp; from their high, liquid providers will be looking to sell. This means forced selling on behalf of all of these new crypto funds that have popped up, which could take prices artificially lower.
The first signs of a comeback can be seen from increasing demand from Asia. Spencer Bogart, a partner at Blockchain Capital in San Francisco, said "most people that are going to wait for lower prices will end up paying higher prices than they are today.”

Homo Deus is another great read if you liked Sapiens. The guy hits the nail on the head in every aspect of where we're headed, in my opinion. We won't need to trust or contribute to anything centralized in nature in the near future. All BS, fluff, and inefficiency will be eliminated from our lives. Even respected professionals like doctors will lose some importance once AR tech telling us how to take care of our bodies based on our genetics.. Interesting stuff.

You're right about crypto and bitcoin being one and the same for "normies." There's a mass adoption of everything decentralized and digitized in nature, and now that these developments are becoming more user-friendly and serve too great a purpose, those that aren't tech inclined can no longer just ignore it.

Damn. Think of all the good ideas and opportunities gone to waste just because of unreliable fiat currencies.. I would've had a nervous breakdown. Happy these problems are soon coming to an end.

There *is* no full-proof currency. Fluctuations have caused suffering and misery since they've existed (great depression, financial crisis of 2008..) Hard to predict if you're not an economist but if you keep up to date and read everything you might be able to notice trends and create your own algorithms of sorts.
