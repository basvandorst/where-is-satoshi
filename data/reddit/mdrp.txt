Most users rip movies they own, so this enables fair use of their purchase...

As I said to shupack, if we stop the special before you get your bitcoins, just send me a private message and I'll honor the current special for you

We offer a ~70% rebate on our product (Normal price is $24.95, btc price is 0.1, so actual rebate depends on usd/btc price). See bottom of page:

the question is: do you properly get the registration serial as you should once the order is complete ? I could only test with simulated data...

Incredible what happens in 29 days! I'll have to adjust the price...

MDRP has many more ripping modes than HandBrake. Also, HandBrake will fail to remove protections from many DVDs.
Check our quick start!

this will fail with arccos protected DVDs... In any case, don't like it, don't buy it! if your setup works for you, that's great!

Thanks! We worked a lot on it!

HandBrake will fail at removing protections of many DVDs, and MDRP has multiple ripping mode that HB doesn't support (such as burning a backup of the DVD).
