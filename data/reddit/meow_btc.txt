Actually, blockchain.info says [here]( that it supports Bitcoin-QT wallet.dat import via the drag-and-drop. It's when you login and attempt to import to an existing wallet, I think, that it only supports the formats you listed above. I think the reason for that (correct me if I'm mistaken) is because a wallet.dat can contain many private keys, and they're making it easier for non-technical users to import all the private keys in the wallet.dat into a brand-new blockchain.info wallet. 
However, the upgrade to 0.8.6 solved my problem beautifully. I resisted upgrading because I thought there was a good chance that there might be issues with running an old version of OSX. Thanks!!

I was trying to import my wallet using the drag-and-drop upload box. I filled in the CAPTCHA and then entered my password. On both Chrome and Firefox I got a "connection refused" message, which freaks me out because I KNOW I have the right password. 
Ok, I will upgrade. Thanks.

I wonder why someone malicious would leave behind such a huge transaction history on one address. I mean, I'd be using mixing services, thousands of different addresses, I would never leave a trail behind like this.

I'm definitely staying up to watch this too. The sight is made even more dramatic by the screechingly high-speed winds that are currently buffeting Southern California. I should make some popcorn.
