Do you regret that now?
Seeing you only lost $150 but when you go up and get like a lot and lose them all at once, thats so depressing lol
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:59:45
Have tried there without any luck.
I always keep an eye on that subreddit though.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:58:23

Sounds fun.
To be honest I never get casino games and don't like them lol.
When I tried, I played satoshi mines and liked it.
Looking to earn a bit more of money before I go back on there.
It also has almost instant cash out after 3 confirmations.

Thanks so much!
My first ever BTC tip :D
Merry Christmas to you
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:48:50
There are a few games where you can play head to head for BTC and are skill based games.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:49:01
I see! Then I take my original comment back. 
I understand why it happens, so I won't say it is a scam, but it wasn't designed to buy something like. BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:57:01
I hope it was not anytime when the BTC price was booming? It sucks though to lose so much 
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:17:54
Seems like I can't.. Don't have 100 Karma :(
@_date: 2013-12-25 11:49:02
Love this!
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:51:57
Thanks very much! I'll be looking for some faucets right now and try to mine at least $0.2 or somwthing. I have i7 and dual gtx 660ti.

There is no way to sell/buy via BTC on eBay.
But what I have done is I put in the deacription that "BTC accepted here, mail me" and I have sold some items like that.
As for buying you could mail and ask the seller.
But this could lead to scams as you ein't be able to open up any case or something because there would be no payment proof,
so be careful.

I do try to educat people about bitcoin but.. no success as of yet.
I take payments for the services I offer mostly in BTC but most of my clients are not from India.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:43:53
This is disturbing lol
@_date: 2013-12-07 11:44:15
It's true, I play it as well!
But I think ref links aren't allowed here, mate.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:40:55
My top request:
Bitcoin easily buyable with Paypal, etc. throughout the world.
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:00:24
Hello brother!
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:48:32
Very good reply, this has helped me.
Thank you very much. More knoedge is always welcome!
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:09:11
Bitcoin makes you regret but you should be content with what you got.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:01:30
It's hard for me as I am saving up every single penny of hard cash I can.
I would buy BTC with my cash, but then there are not even a single place where I can spend my BTC at where I live.
So to survive, I need to save my cash.

Time to draw a wizard!
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:44:19
I'm currently driving.
I'll give you a link tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:06:43
I am happy that you got all back.
And I am glad that you realize now. I realized after the same happened with me as well. One realizes with experience only.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:26:47
I can help with design and branding!
PM me.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:10:50
I am thankful for reddit :D
Because I got to know about BTC through reddit.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:55:53
I can see how it can give a bad impression.
Should have used the word advice.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:15:57
Same for a lot more people who did some research on it, I suppose.
@_date: 2013-12-25 11:50:30
I agree!
It was just for fun though :)
If I am free, I might make 1 more
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:08:31
Is it really possible?
Could you explain a bit more as to how I can do that?
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:13:09
My only Bitcoin wish is that Satoshi sends me over 10 BTC for Christmas.
Your wishes could be helpful though.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:29:49
Fantastic subreddit lol.
I am not a girl though
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:51:34
