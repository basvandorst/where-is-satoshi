 I'm in ux design and crypto, and what you've started with this is super interesting. A lot of negativity in here from people who don't get the potential - but keep it going, all your comments are totally on point about your projects point of difference, and gamification of trading if it's visualised just right. Super cool :)

That doesn't mean what you think it does. Proof of concept isn't a sketch of an idea someone had, it is actually even more in depth than a mock up - in a project like this it would be a minimal-features pilot version that actually works, demonstrating value to stakeholders and potential investors. This post is just a very basic back-of-napkin level sketch of 'like Fiverr but with Crypto'. For every million people that have one of these 'like [established company] but with [slightly different angle the established company could pivot to themselves if it was really viable], about 3 have the resources to get it to production... Best of luck to op being one of these. And no big dev company is gonna invest their valuable time in this because it will dead in the time it takes Fiverr to accept crypto payments themselves... not a hard thing to implement.

I would check your other accounts - Bittrex had a lot of users phished by a phony 'blttrex.com' recently (with a lower case 'L' not an i, but coming up first in google), and any email / password combos taken are being compromised on other exchanges too. Or your email / passsword combo is on a list of compromised accounts from another source - change all your passwords asap :)
