This isn't a problem with Coinbase.  You are delusional if you think it is.  You might want to spend some time learning about the internet and how it does and does not work.

Just triple check that the address you are using is your address.  There are browser extensions that will try and replace the address.

Someone is spending a lot of money to spam the network.  Sit back and let them pay our miners. :)

More Trump articles.  This is a very long article that mentions the word bitcoin once.  Below is the relevant paragraph.

You either care way too much about what random internet strangers think because you have a huge ego or you are still trying to troll us.  Either way you are not worth the time.  This isn't a solar, farming or mining sub.  Go get your fix elsewhere.

Or they just don't have the hashing power to begin with(ponzi scheme).

Normal variance in new found blocks.  Blocks take on average of 10 minutes but can happen seconds to many minutes after a block is found.  If you look at the link below, you can see that there was 70 minutes between blocks found around the time you sent your transaction.  So just bad timing while the system returns to normal after a recent large difficulty adjustment.

Of course it is 50% off, you're selling it for more than 50% markup.  I found almost everything you are selling for less than half the price elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:15:55
This is money we are talking about.  Nobody cares what their intentions are, real or perceived, they care about money.  People with large chunks of bitcoin have large amounts because they know the potential and agree with it.  Selling it now would be throwing away that potential and they are already selling what they need to sell so why do it?
@_date: 2017-01-26 23:21:01
If only there was a solution where privacy is always on, where nobody can trace the source and destination of your funds without your permission.  If only such a solution could be mentioned here, we might all have a working example to discuss and hopefully spur similar development in the bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-01-27 17:37:10
Right, you don't want to argue.  You stated an opinion when you said "could be".  And I followed it with my opinion which is perfectly logical.  If you want a fact based discussion, maybe you should set the example for us to follow.

What has the potential to be more valuable in the next 8 years.  Your girlfriend or bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-01-24 17:01:26
I like how this is brought up when their is a backlog of transactions.  Nice play for attention, Mike.

It might not be better at scaling but that isn't really an objective way to look at this.  Objectively what matters is does the scaling hinder its security or not and we won't know that for some time.  With monero the mining aspect is very different than with bitcoin as you can mine with CPUs and GPUs and won't get the exponential gains you get with ASICs like you do with Bitcoin.  This particular aspect of monero might offset the deficiency in scaling that is present in monero and allow it to stay secure and proliferate just as much as bitcoin since average people won't be priced out of mining so quickly.  Monero still needs to prove itself but is already exciting and setting an example.

Can we stop calling it fake volume?  It's wasn't technically fake volume.  It was just a lot of volume because there was no cost to trade.  
@_date: 2017-01-30 19:51:13
Looks like an unconfirmed transaction.  Can you be more specific about your question?
@_date: 2017-01-27 23:39:40
There are some malicious browser extensions that detect when you are trying to send bitcoin using coinbase and will replace the receiving address you put in with their own.
  
Example:

That's actually a very good policy on their part.  People get their gmail hacked all the time and if their 2factor is linked to their gmail along with their exchange login(very likely) then the 2factor is basically useless.  I've seen quite a few cases on this sub but not recently(probably because of rules like this).

Someone is spamming the network, sit back and let them spend their money.
@_date: 2017-01-30 21:19:03
Take the bullshit back to @_date: 2017-01-23 22:29:58
You can consider it anything you want, but that doesn't make you right.  Bots trading are still real trades.  If you had proof otherwise it would be huge news.
  
By perpetuating the "fake trading" narrative you are turning off the general public because of false perceptions.

That's not true, I sold millions of doge the moment it was announced and never looked back.  Look at the commits and correlate with charts, doge never recovered from that code change and the ensuing drama.
  
@_date: 2017-01-24 16:59:12
This looks just like when Mike Hearn was spamming the network to try and prove bitcoin was broken.  Whoever it is will eventually run out of money, that's how this works.  We don't need to go changing the code every time someone wants to spend their money clogging up the network.  There will come a day when it is too expensive to undertake and this issue will go away.
  
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:03:36
Agreed, but it will be used to attack bitcoin from a social aspect.
@_date: 2017-01-26 20:40:10
But they like cash because you have to transport it and that makes it easy to confiscate. :)
@_date: 2017-01-27 17:27:10
Alright, I see you just want to argue and don't care about logic or common sense.  Not going to bother since it would be like trying to argue with a Trump supporter.
@_date: 2017-01-23 21:13:38
What does your forum offer that bitcointalk.org doesn't?
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:00:31
No one will sell them the bitcoin they need.  When these funds invest, they invest tens of millions at a time.  They cannot buy that much on the open market and miners aren't selling.
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:19:19
Could be Gemini auctions, I'd love to know.
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:51:51
I am not a fan of people misleading people for their own entertainment.
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:09:49
I don't know if I believe it.  From what auctions?  I think it was bitfury who openly said they aren't selling.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:56:10
Unfortunately they don't publish any data for us to review so we don't know if they are selling.  We have actual mining farm operators telling us they aren't selling large quantities to those inquiring.

How is that not timing out?
@_date: 2017-01-24 16:31:32
A spam attack was started yesterday, it is very clear when you look at the last 7 days worth of transactions.  Nothing you can do nor do you want to, they will eventually run out of money.
   
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:03:20
The argument is that banks will benefit from a lack of regulation due to the Trump presidency(not guaranteed) and make investments in blockchain tech unprofitable(not gauranteed).  So banks will stop investing in blockchain tech because of Trump.
  
It's a terrible article.

All you have to do is look at his history to know he is a compulsive liar and a good one at that.  Stop being so easily led.
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:29:09
I agree, I was thinking they were referring to a single auction and I feel like we would have heard more about that.  Makes sense they could do it across multiple auctions and I had forgotten about geminis auctions.
@_date: 2017-01-30 17:59:48
Traders(whales) do this all the time.  There is risk because another whale could buy up your dump and move it higher forcing you to either not buy back in or buy back in at a higher price. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:36:11
It's hard to feel bad for you.  Coinbase didn't run a compromised browser to access your account.  You did.  Were you polite and reasonable with the support people? 
@_date: 2017-01-24 17:10:34
That graph is 7 days worth of transactions.  You can clearly see it starting just before midnight on the 23rd. 
@_date: 2017-01-30 22:28:46
I'm not picking sides, I'm not justifying your bullshit by doing that.  If you want to be someone else's tool then do it, but leave this place out of it.  Picking sides is for and their monkey brains.

The same 1000 people going back and forth are not going to continue to use locabitcoins.  They are going to just contact each other and cut out localbitcoins.

This was just a dry run.  Wait until they throw a few million at it.

Don't give him any attention, just downvote anything Kim Dotcom related and make him work for it.
