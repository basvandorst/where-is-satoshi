Not really mate, one more leg up ������������
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:57:33
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:35:11
Can somebody tell how to use this code? I am not a programmer so I have no idea where to start, thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:52:00
Haha why wait? Now is the time to show support ����
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:55:39
That's true but I still support bitcoin 100% because it if wasn't by Satoshi and the bitcoin invention, we wouldn't we chating right now 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:19:52
Don't worry the hype is on the US market now, so it's a sleeping giant! ��������������

�� 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:18:07
They would risk if they sale, so hodl or buy more i believe 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:04:12
Your opinion, take it or leave it 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:45:04
Sad bad true in some people
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:20:57
Not really. Never for a loss and it depends on your entry. It's a crucial time to show how strong of a community we are. Also, timing the market is difficult so you could easily miss out on a good entry point 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:07:11
This was 8 hours ago 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:20:24
You are the man! ����������
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:13:53
For real this is huge 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:09:12
Well good point. Let me clarify what I mean. It has one more leg up based on the Elliot wave theory, some room to grow DYOR 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:02:41
I agree with you. I am a long term holder but want to see more support from the community in the bad times too. I did zoom out and there is still one more wave up based on the Elliot wave theory. Just my 2 cents ��
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:45:33
Hahaha �� 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:12:35
Bro there is one more leg up based on the Elliot wave theory (we are entering wave 5 so still room to grow) I will get back to you when we hit 10 k but not this time DYOR 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:49:56
Thank for your energy mate, we are in this together ��������
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:31:52
I don't think so cause bitcoin is now a good buy cause is cheap. DYOR 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:35:22
Not at all, just informing the community. You decide on what you want to take from this 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:59:27
Not worried bro, i just want to see more support from the community during hard times, that's all �� Also, This is what I am fucking taking about!! And remember to hodl strong!! ���� ��
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:42:11
Shit mate, try later. We are on this together ����
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:29:51
Also, golden opportunity for Wall Street to go long during the futures launch cause they will buy the dip 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:04:57
You forgot to say, buy the fucking dip!!! Lol ��������������
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:36:16
�� 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:08:58
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:16:56
No, read the article, all info is there 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:04:47
Don't worry, they will. Also, spread the love like ��!! ��
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:38:52
I think so too because a lot of people got into the market at 11k+ and are scared of the massive drop so potentially we might see a dip
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:33:58
Always DYOR 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:38:20
Can you do this with a ledger nano s ?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:11:09
Congrats man!! Hope to be in your shoes in 5 years 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:56:33
Seriously, wealthier than carlos slim 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:38:55
I wish I had watch this back then 
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:09:43
Holly shit
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:12:18
This shit sounds fake 
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:47:23
We got to hunt down this guy and make him do what he promised on national TV �� 
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:08:11
Well done mate! �� 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:43:18
Nicely said bro 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:46:34
A Thera are massive amounts of suspicious accounts out there posting FUD about bitcoin and supporting bitcoin cash 
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:43:24
�� dude you are hilarious 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:54:27
Vagina 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:44:33
On a side note, Why the fuck is John macaffee supporting bitcoin cash? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:08:03
Yes, in theory, bitcoin should correct one more leg lower before going up again, just TA analysis 
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:23:59
Lambo!! Here we go!! I love u!! 
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:02:52
�� 
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:49:22
I agree with you bro, but for a major (and I mean huge, lol) correction to occur, there needs to be a catalyst to create a panic sell of BTC. But the horizon looks wright so far, and the charts look still good 
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:50:56
Bitcoin ATM?
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:24:26
Hahaha �� 
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:50:34
Go to a Bitcoin ATM mate 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:06:14
Happy bitcoinween!
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:48:21
I want to know too
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:31:45
Great!! Just don't get emotions get to you because the price fluctuation in bitcoin is huge, good luck mate 
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:16:54
Hold!! BT2 has good potential of being worth a good amount of money once it comes out 
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:52:47
Holly smokes this is awesome 
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:25:20
 That's true but the single or combined sale would have to be substantial (huge) to make the market doubt about selling or holding. A drop of $300 is not big enough to create a sell off in bitcoin, this is business as usual and most likely the market will eat up the remains of the whale and move on. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:58:21
Does not sound legit
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:35:03
Inspiring story 
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:01:11
No man, but good luck and hope you recover your funds 
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:45:32
It's about your citizenship. If you are a US alien, then the IRS will be behind you wherever you go. Since you are from Spain, check the rules that apply for your country.
@_date: 2017-10-08 05:41:28
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:51:48
Count me in for the $7,000 party!! 
@_date: 2017-10-29 04:28:06
I heard that it costs around $1,000 to nine 1 BTC
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:25:28
Whale sold BTC, no major bad news catalyst on sight to create a correction 
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:27:09
Bro just buy it on coinbase with your credit card and pay your card with cash 
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:51:30
Hahha �� 
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:35:53
Can't wait until we pass the $10,000 wall 
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:52:15
That's literally all of us 
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:37:21
I am sure Lazlo kill himself already and Jerkos bought a fancy ass mansion and a couple of lambos here in Miami �� 
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:50:05
I agree, if you won't need the money any time soon, then go ahead and buy it. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:45:20
Because I currently own BTC and I am not thinking on selling yet, so while holding it I will increase my gains. Obviously, if there is a big correction in the market, I will buy more bitcoin while it is on sale
