Interactive brokers. Assuming you’ve traded futures before. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:49:42
Yea. I’d wait for Monday to get a real read on the picture. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:07:05
I ended up paying around $60cad to wire money to kraken. It arrived, but took like a week and a half. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:57:26
This is correct. 
Usually in futures, storage cost is reflected as well, but since bitcoin futures are cash settled, there really isn’t any storage cost. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:02:53
If you pay the correct fees, there isn’t much of a delay (basically the time it takes to confirm then next block) when transferring crypto. 
What does take time is transferring fiat between exchanges, which somewhat isolates each exchange and creates these price differences.

Thx for pointing out, I thought they were identical term sheets, but they’re not. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:06:24
I’m curious about the difficulty of getting fiat in and out of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:11:17
I think they’re complaining about the verification process taking forever. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:49:00
Well it is Sunday. 
Looks like about 800 contracts have traded so far. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:54:55
It’s not moving bitcoin around that’s the issue, it’s moving the fiat around that is. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:53:28
There are various pause breakers below 20%, but should the market move more than 20%, trading is shut down for the day. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:58:25
Projections based on what? Please don’t tell me technicals.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:32:15
Honestly, I think Sunday (and next week for that matter) will be a non-event. 
As someone that’s traded futures, I can tell you that the hand cuffs carrying brokers have put on traders who want to open a futures position in bitcoin is crazy.  I think the futures market is going to take time to develop. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:10:05
Exactly. Not to mention that the margin requirements are rather hefty. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:58:56
Yes and no. 
Because the futures are cash settled and settled at a reference price at contract expiry, they have no direct link to the physical bitcoin market itself. 
Now if the futures were bitcoin settled, that could be different. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:42:05
So if you consider the new futures rules:
- 50% initial margin to open a position (so you have to put up 50%
- should bitcoin move more than 20% in a day (which it’s done often and recently), a circuit breaker gets hit and trading for the day shuts down. 
- if you’re short and the market is circuit breaker closed (or limit up as traders would call it), that is a living nightmare for a trader. 
- because you can see open interest in futures,  if other guys see shorts caught within limit up, they’ll just place higher bids at tomorrow’s open and create a squeeze where shorts literally can’t get out (as the market would be limit up again the next day right at the open)
- dunno about you, but that’s just too much risk to take on a short position imo.

I was just thinking about this as well, and while it won't be tomorrow, aren't we like 40% of the way there (which if correct, isn't that far off)?
Irregardless of when it is though, shouldn't there actually be an official endgame plan for system integrity once bitcoin mining rewards stop?
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:14:13
So any guess on transaction fee impact going forward?

I don't know if I would rely on a technical indicator to try and predict something that's driven by exterior social phenomenon, but thanks for posting ��

For point 1, he's saying if the world's wealth primarily moves to decentralized currency, what will be the source of public goods funding.

Just curious why this article needs to be reposted once per minute?
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:10:38
See, I know you think you’re saying that because you think that it will give institutions a chance to go short. But what happens when those short futures contracts have to be delivered against? Especially if their monthly contracts. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:16:41
I guess I should remind you that the CME are launching bitcoin futures. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:52:44
I’ve actually wondered thus myself.  Btc seems to be taking big dives during North American market opens. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:31:40
I stopped by to say thank you for the lol

Wait, what law specifically was passed that made dealing with bitcoin illegal as a business in Canada?
@_date: 2017-09-24 17:12:58
Do you by chance also earn crypto by referring people?
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:34:53
So what is to stop this software to continue mining after you've left the site?
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:51:08
Because fiat is centralized, more observable and regulated (assuming it's in a bank account) and not in cash. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:47:23
As a website user, this weirds me out. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:14:36
I've forgotten about it several times. That's how long ago we bought one. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:58:57
They're using technical analysis, which basically applies the notion that based on psychology and other factors, prices tend to move in certain, generally identifiable pattern sets, and if you can identify which pattern the price is moving in, you can predict, on a short term basis, where the price moves to. 
In reality this only sometimes works, but often times doesn't (probably because prices are reactionary to unpredictable circumstances), but since it sometimes does work, a lot of people believe in this type of approach and it ultimately becomes a self fulfilling prophecy of sorts.

I think banning ICOs is one thing, to which I think Russia may actually be working on a decent framework to regulate. I think the more concerning thing here is banning crypto conversions to fiat across all trading platforms... that would be a major blow if adopted.

Still held in a paper wallet. We view it as one of many worst case scenario anti fiat insurance policies.
