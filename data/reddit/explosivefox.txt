What's that? 
@_date: 2015-03-18 01:12:19
Ah, thanks! 
@_date: 2013-09-11 01:31:26
Thank you so much for saying 1000 million rather than one billion :) 
@_date: 2013-09-14 01:09:10
Cool if you're truthing. Not so much if not...

I actually went back today. He had a bitcoin pin on his shirt :D
@_date: 2013-09-14 01:15:12
I got mine :D
but in all seriousness, fuck BFL.

I'm 17 and I've mined bitcoins for about 2 years, but I lost all my money when my compy crashed earlier this year... I had multiple backups, but all were on the actual computer because I was a dumb. Now, I have like 6 backups living in and out of my computer, so do your worst, nature!

not if the drive was formatted I don't think. I'm gonna look into it though! If i can recover my money I'm buying a Trezor with it!

My dad still thinks Bitcoin is a stupid idea that will never pay off in the end...
@_date: 2013-09-14 01:07:03
Hardleft is the fuckin man!

It was self service lamination. The guy at the kiosk never had a hold of the wallet.

Ah, sorry about that! I'm abandoning this post for the Bitmit market, so I'll delete this post. Sorry again!

George Takai?

You deserve gold. Or bitcoins. Sadly, I have neither btc or fiat, so I cannot give the gift that I so badly want to :&lt;
@_date: 2013-09-08 04:39:06
I can sell it to you through Bitmit if you like, they offer escrow services.
@_date: 2013-09-17 18:39:55
I know, right? Really great quality stuff.
@_date: 2013-09-08 05:25:44
definitely will do. Also, congrats on the 4700!
@_date: 2013-09-20 01:56:06
So... How big? :3
@_date: 2013-10-13 03:42:20
My dad actually works for Box and I can't recommend them enough. Just a great service that I honestly can't find fault with. 
@_date: 2013-09-20 01:56:23
Weird and proud!
@_date: 2013-09-20 02:05:58
Why thank y'all. :D
@_date: 2013-09-20 02:03:06
well, he didn't really laminate it. There's a self-service machine that I used. He just rung me up for the plastic used.
@_date: 2013-09-17 01:27:35
Thanks for that! I was away from the computer getting my paper wallet laminated at FedEx. 
@_date: 2013-09-08 03:53:06
I certainly understand where you're coming from and I hope you have luck in your future bitcoin endeavors! I'll definitely try eBay and Bitmit next if I have no luck here. 
@_date: 2013-09-20 01:54:35
Because of all the "hope ya didn't print on a public compy" comments: Nope, printed from home, THEN went to FedEx. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:02:56
I love that blowstamps have become a thing
@_date: 2013-09-20 02:03:17
Nope :3
@_date: 2013-09-20 02:05:06
Wat. I photocopied nothing.  I was careful to obfuscate the private key at all times and folded the wallet soon after lamination. Also, this was at like midnight, so nobody else was really there to see the key.
@_date: 2013-09-11 10:06:37
That'd be great!
