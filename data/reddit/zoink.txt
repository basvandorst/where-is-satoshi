It looks like they have also removed bitcoin cash from the charts. 
Edit: and it's back

This is amusing to me in light of Schiff's recent debate on inflation.  Concerning "inflation" he kept yelling at his interlocutor for using "inflation" to describe price increases. Then he took calls and emails citing definitions of "inflation" from early 20th century dictionaries.
When it comes to bitcoins he goes off using the colloquial understanding of intrinsic and making [comments like this on the Ed &amp; Ethan show]( 
Then again I've always thought Schiff was a bit of a buffoon who received too much cred in the libertarian community.

Isn't this brigading? I think the term get's thrown around a lot when it doesn't apply but this definitely strikes me as brigading.

When I woke up that was the first thing I saw about bitcoin.  Thought to myself: " What, did it drop below the previous bubble's peak?  We go all the way back to two digits even?" &lt;goes and checks chart for the night&gt; "The lowest it got was 400?  What is wrong with you people?"
