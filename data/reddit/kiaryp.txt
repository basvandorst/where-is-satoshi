That's wishful thinking unfortunately.

We should make a wall of shame of all the redditors who were saying that it was obviously just a clean road up from here.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:04:52
What do you mean it's not helping things? A business can't afford to hold it, it has expenses.
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:06:33
Vendor wants more customers. I think if I had a choice between 2 places, on of them accepting Bitcoin all other things being equal I'd go to the one accepting Bitcoin.

Imagine actually believing what he believes.

Collecting art, stamps and comic books are a hobby. Gold used to have transactional value because it was actually used as a currency and it still kind of does but only for large institutions (a person isn't going to store his own gold or transact with it.)
Bitcoin is like gold except it doesn't have that transactional value for institutions, so it's worse than gold in that sense, but better because an individual can store it easily.
But if individuals don't use it to transact then it will essentially mean that no one uses it to transact. If it's not used to transact then yeah it will essentially become like stamp collection where the value is driven entirely by sentiment.
I don't think that making Bitcoin a technologically fancy stamp collection hobby is the best we can do with this.

Of course Bitcoin does very little to protect privacy, but still.

This is from the "no resistance until 15k" guy

Businesses do all kinds of shit to try to win repeat customers because that's how they make money. they give reward Punch cards and etc ... How does a reward punch-card help a business?
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:51:03
That's not true. It's somewhat of a hip thing that's worth a try. Literally no vendors actually care about holding Bitcoin because they need to restock and pay their employees in dollars.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:57:27
The vendor can attract the customers who would rather pay in bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-02 15:10:34
So you're just promoting some limited edition collection scheme and not a currency huh
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:19:10
Because that's how adoption takes place.
Selling as part of BAU does help volatility, because it provides some predictable supply in proportion to the revenue coming into the business.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:03:26
If the only thing that people do is buy and hold expecting the value will keep going up because other people are buying and holding and only sell when they really need the money then all you've really built is a giant Ponzi scheme.
If vendors are willing to transact in bitcoin then it's the first step to adoption, because they have a supply chain upstream that will receive some market signals that perhaps they should also accept Bitcoin. When a vendor is able to restock using Bitcoin then he'll start holding on to some Bitcoin in order to do so.
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:30:57
Vendor wants to attract more customers
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:31:20
51% attacks make it mutable.
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:01:43
Well you can obviously do that, but if you don't want to you can pay directly in Bitcoin and have the vendor worry about that. I think you're caught in some hodl mentality where if someone is selling it he's not doing the right thing... If Bitcoin is just for hodling it's completely worthless.
@_date: 2019-07-01 03:52:36
Except just about all businesses need fiat to buy whatever they need. So if they're getting back bitcoin and it's volatile...
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:37:51
Because it's just another payment method that some customers may prefer.

It was straight out of the mouth of a Google "fairness" exec.
And she didn't even deny it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:49:23
I bailed right before it! Hehe
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:45:01
Wrong. DCA is fine but you need trailing stops and you also have to mind what you're doing during unreasonable spikes.
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:08:09
wow we're almost at 100k!
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:40:56
did you hop on leg with a horseshoe 5 times before making that prediction?
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:45:18
It's nowhere near as dangerous as not having stops

It doesn't matter if you use tor or mempool or lightning, packets get routed by internet providers.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:23:12
People are paying for internet access, yes because internet doesn't work without infrastructure that's owned by ISPs.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:51:11
... payment is like .000001% of the problem of running your own internet.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:50:11
Sounds a lot like luck
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:14:57
Do you understand Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:01:50
Yeah no, there are a bunch of routing algorithms to make sure things happen quickly and sure maybe you can connect a bunch of phones with Bluetooth or wireless into a network, but to get onto the internet as it exists today someone on your network is going to need access through an ISP, because ISPs own a significant portion of all network infrastructure and they control the connectivity of network devices to their infrastructure.
Thinking that you can replace that with something like lightning network just means you dont know what you're talking about, because Bitcoin as a protocol is built on top of network protocols, so Lightning network assumes you have access to the internet network in the first place. And of course lightning is much slower than just raw internet so you won't be playing counterstrike over it and even if you could, it would be a waste of currency, because you would already be paying an ISP just to access the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:30:11
You're talking about a mesh network then.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:02:08
Which has nothing to do with lightning or Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:35:00
Ok, now this is the dumbest thing.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:35:54
What is a human brain? It's just a mesh network of neurons man. It's all inter-connected dude...
Wait let's go back to your original quote.


Yeah ok, I think we're done here.
@_date: 2019-09-21 20:16:54
It allows for resolving arbitrary transactional instruments.
@_date: 2019-09-26 01:47:35
Except the economy actually grows in value.
@_date: 2019-09-21 20:08:50
Ethereum is not a scam, it's just experimental technology. Bitcoin maximalists are so dumb. The chance of Bitcoin going to 0 or near 0 is only slightly smaller than the chance of ethereum going to 0. Both happen the moment crypto exchanges become illegal in the first world.
