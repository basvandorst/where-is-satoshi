There isn't insurance like a bank without the government (or huge VC investment I guess) . Not sure why you would trust anyone with your coins really, what qualifies as 'trust enough to hold it' for you?

I though about something like this too; bitcoin college savings plan that gains interest. Assuming security is done right, I'd still think it hard to convince people to use it without something like FDIC insurance. What do you think?

Your home router is proxying through a bitcoin network?
That's not normal. Your home router should almost never proxy through *anything* by default.
Who initially configured the router? Is it your ISPs router? Has anyone done "work" in your home that had access to your router or wireless Internet? 
I would advise you to reset your router to factory defaults and reconfigure it, or call your ISP to have them do it (and see if it is still going through any proxy).

I want to throw Potcoin in as an example of an alt that isn't just pump n dump (IMO); active community and ATMs in use in USA even. One advantage I see is transaction time, albeit if we used NFC I believe that negates the slower Bitcoin times. But I'm interested to hear people's thoughts on the issue as a whole, no doubt some alts are just pump/dump.

@_date: 2013-12-08 02:50:54
As supply decreased would the value (and demand for that matter ) not increase? Until the very moment the last bitcoin is lost and supply is replaced the value then would plummet then perhaps? If a contingency plan exists then speculative value needn't worry, but hope that coins are lost. And how small can a bitcoin be broken up,  I thought a satoshi/0.00000001 was smallest.  (I'm no expert in any of these subjects, just pondering)

@_date: 2013-12-08 23:51:36
Any business making the decision to accept bitcoin understands that it is a long term investment and that its value would increase over time thus they shouldn't react to the markets in the short term nor depend on it for short term cash flow. IMHO they are smart for potentially making way more value in the future for taking BTC now. A $50 video game purchase today could be worth $50,000 in the not too distant future. The risk vs. reward or ROI is worth it if you have the capital to support your business needs / bills and not rely on weekly withdrawals from  the bitcoin wallet... Not every product or purchase will use bitcoin anyways.
