Why is bitcoin referred to as a community? The dollar isn't a community, so why should bitcoin be one?
And the ecosystem stuff too. Is the Amazon rainforest a blockchain? No. It isn't. So how has digital cash become an ecology? It needs to become cash first, surely?

I'd be interested to know how much it costs the IRS to collect tax on bitcoin. A Freedom of Information request may reveal that, if that is possible?
Simplistic example: for $1 collected, it might cost the IRS .6c. (probably more, because seigniorage on a dollar bill is .5c alone)
This cost (of collecting bitcoin chargeable gains) I assume will increase with adoption, because they will theoretically be chasing more people around the block.
At which point does it then become economically unviable to collect tax on bitcoin? There is an opportunity cost to seigniorage to consider in this: conceivably the government would consider reforming the IRS, as they may as well spend that .6c on bitcoin themselves instead of on the cost of collecting tax on it.
Especially as chargeable gains will only occur in the event of bitcoin rising
An economist once ( I think it was Adam Smith) said tax should be simple to understand and easy to collect.

Volatility is something that happens unexpectedly.
Bitcoin technology, doesn't fundamentally change. There is ongoing development, but its a steady process with pre-defined objectives.
The dollar on the other hand, is always having to run to catch its breath.
That is why bitcoin doesn't (fundamentally) change; but the dollar price action does.
The dollar is deleveraging into bitcoin. Its not bitcoin itself that is volatile. 
And don't think I'm demonising the dollar. It has served its purpose.

What I don't get is how this works with bitcoin - since it's not physical.

Futures contracts were designed as insurance contracts, or hedges.
That is why hedge funds are called hedge funds.
That is why 90% + of futures expire worthless. 
There are hundreds of different types of hedge funds as a result.
It sounds like you know more about bitcoin futures than me. I am curious therefore why speculators, miners and businesses need to hedge bitcoin when they know the dollar price of bitcoin is by nature dollar volatile?
edit* my point is one of the attractions of bitcoin (but not the only one) is dollar volatility. I don't understand why people want to hedge it. Its like saying I'm into heroin but when I'm a bit sick of it I want to know there is a nice warm coffee waiting for me when I get home

As we move toward the micro-transaction, assigning any dollar value (to bitcoin) could well become redundant. Along with the idea of it being an investment.
Possibly within five years
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:07:19
Yes. Futures were originally created as an insurance for merchants who undertook risks in bring commodities to market.
Risks included the ship sinking, the commodity being spoiled. The market price collapsing whilst in transit.
So futures were meant as zero sum gain.
Then speculators realised trading opportunity.
So leads back to the point, why are exchanges creating futures contracts?
Why create a contract on something that has no time risk (or at least the most negligible time risk of any commodity there is) and on something that can't be physically delivered?
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:34:10

@_date: 2017-12-01 18:50:18
If you were five years old, trying to explain futures contracts - let alone bitcoin - would not be a normal course of conversation.
But since you asked.
Futures contracts were originally created as an insurance. They protected merchants against price swings in the commodities - such as coffee, cotton, livestock - they were transporting to market. In the age where things were done by steam and wind power.
So if I was transporting something that took three months to bring to market, I would take a futures contract. This meant if the price of the commodity I was transporting dropped, instead of me nursing potentially bankrupting losses, I would be hedged.
This is where hedge funds get their name from.
As time went on, traders realised they could speculate on futures. Technically, a futures contract is the *right and obligation* to take physically delivery of the commodity. This makes them high risk, when leveraged.
*Ah*, I hear you ask; *but bitcoin isn't physical. And its digital, so it doesn't take more than ten minutes* (give me a break on this one peeps, she/he is only 5 years old) *to deliver*. 
So why are futures contracts being created in bitcoin?
Simple answer: speculators love volatility. There is no real need or reason for bitcoin futures contracts other than dollar volatility. It is pure financialisation.
Furthermore, when you hear people say futures contracts will stabilise the dollar price of bitcoin; shorting bitcoin will drop the price....don't believe a word of it.
In my opinion, futures contracts and bitcoin will create a financial shock and awe never seen or witnessed before.
It will be like Wall Street handing out free million dollar tokens to the hodlers.

So an option is the right but not the obligation (to buy or sell). A future is the right *and* the obligation (to buy or take physical delivery). Why would someone take a contract on bitcoin, which isn't tangible? Or the least time exposed commodity there is? Why not just buy and hodl?

This is cash in the context of micro transactions which the current system makes difficult.
Bargaining power ? If prices are a decreasing fraction of consumer bargain (disposable income), then micro transactions become possible. Perhaps 'power' is mis placed in this context, but what it alludes to is the mitigation of mental transaction costs as 'cash' increases in purchasing ability.
In a historical context, this is why haggling reduced - it's not worth the effort
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:13:07
yes, because of the secular deflationary nature all currencies will (or at least, could) follow if bitcoin is adopted as an international gold-like standard and where these currencies become comparable to each other in their purchasing power as a result.
It's a shift in emphasis from bitcoin itself being an everyday money, to it being designed for a higher level of settlement.
Hal Finney intimated at this on a few occasions ie at the base layer computational level, bitcoin will have problems scaling
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:47:10
Yes, potentially. One day we shall see world currencies being denominated in Satoshi's, but the point that is being made in the blog is bitcoin can bring into order ALL world currencies and money by being targeted as a value standard.

I was talking to some friends over last weekend about bitcoin - it was bank holiday so we had time on our hands. Similar to your story, all professional people. 
When we got talking, all of them had one question - 'but I don't understand how it has or holds its value?' I just said trust. Why do you trust the pound in your pocket?
And the conversation didn't stop as such, it just paused - maybe for a few days, weeks, months...who knows? We then started talking about something else, but I know they will come back to it at some point
In the meantime, they'll read some misrepresentation of it in the media
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:16:22

Exchanges are not trustless I accept, however trustless transactions are possible with bitcoin and blockchain. That's the point of it.

Saw his interview with Max Keiser last week and was surprised by his reasoning why he doesn't like bitcoin ie its not backed by anything, there will be another crypto along in a minute, the kids will be left crying when it collapses, merchants don't accept it as money.
Although he did express some regret he didn't buy at $3, his reason for not liking it may be explained by a generational thing. He cited Jim Rogers as not liking it too and the real reason is probably not they just don't understand it, but they don't *need* to understand it at the moment.
Schiff is a gold bug - but I wonder if he understands the ideal of gold as an investment (a store of value that fights inflation) has been replaced by technology in muting inflationary forces over the past decade despite low interest rates, unparralled money printing and high employment.
This is because the rise of automation and fall of computer and storage costs means people can live more easy and cheaper than previous times. Look at the cost of an iPhone and the functionality it performs.
And this is why bitcoin and blockchain money will just keep growing - its money for the internet which will keep distributing the benefits of technology in a way centralised banking systems cannot.
Bitcoin has made physical gold an investment superstition, which no doubt Schiff and Jim Rogers would scoff at - and they'll probably only change their minds when they see bitcoin all around them and their existing client bases and believers stops generating revenue for them
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:18:23
I think we will have to agree to differ on this. Bitcoin is peer-to-peer. Its frictionless. And irreversible. So if something goes wrong ie you send to the wrong address or if you don't get what you bargained for in return, there is no middleman to mediate a dispute. The facilitating process of bitcoin and blockchain works through software, hardware and energy exerted. This is why billions is being invested in the space in hope of future savings from dis-intermediation.

There are still inflationary pressures, predominantly from costs of fraud and also currency devaluations - for example the cost of energy in the UK is increasing due to weak sterling. Also, as liquidity has become more sophisticated it means different demographics are affected by different types of inflation. However generally speaking inflation is not the problem it was. In fact the opposite, the problem being faced by bankers is they can't generate enough of it

we started [Hodl The Moon]( about 6 months ago, although beyond that [Fina Boutique]( had been going for 5 years plus. Our general idea is not to talk too literally about bitcoin, but laterally. Although striking a balance can be difficult in these early days.
Hodl the Moon has subsequently hit a Google rating of 10/100. For those that don't know, going from 0-10 is easier than getting from 10-20 and so on. It works on a difficulty basis similar to Coin.
Anyway, the new language of bitcoin blogging inevitably includes hodl and moon and I still find it refreshing when I hear those terms - it never suggests cynicism to me or anything else other than something new, fresh and still in gestation. I know the Cash people come over here with a corporate agenda and missives about about disorganisations. Let them (wear themselves out).
At end of the day, blogging comes down to originality. Which is the result of sincerity and creativity. I struggle to understand how the guys behind Cash (let alone advocates) can take themselves seriously - it appears so obviously hackneyed.
So when it rains, let it pour.

It means the dollar shouldn't be demonized. It doesn't force us to do anything, we always have a choice. It also has a utility - gives the best for the most - but as liquidity becomes more sophisticated, the dollar will cease to be as important. The genius of bitcoin - and I don't believe in anything else - is it's energy proofing of a distributed consensus. It makes all things possible. Besides, we are all getting excited at the moment with bitcoin because of dollar price action

@_date: 2017-11-11 15:57:03
I've said somewhere else in this discussion that bitcoin in itself is not volatile: volatility is something which behaves unpredictably. 
Bitcoin technology remains pretty much unchanged, the only *real* things happening with it now are second layer stuff ie development (Segwit, Lightning Network). And this is following a natural path. And I'm disregarding the altcoins which have fallen off the coat tails of bitcoin - for example, bitcoin cash isn't bitcoin - its bitcoin cash
The only volatility surrounding bitcoin is the dollar price. And one of the problems with the dollar is it has proved it cannot appreciate - hence my assertions that for first world (professionally managed) monetary systems, inflation is nigh on a solved problem - or at least it isn't the problem it used to be (ie, its not systemic - unlike places like Venezuela).
In fact, where interest rates are lower than inflation (as they are with the world's leading currencies, including the dollar) to talk about *stability* is also misleading. Fiat is no longer a store of value, which is why asset prices in stocks, bonds, property are reaching sky high levels. Talk about bubbles. Risk is becoming displaced to return in the traditional sense.
Its not bitcoin volatility as such which will cause the bitcoin price to moon (in dollar terms). Its the underlying volatility of the US dollar. Which, in my opinion, is far more uncertain (and therefore volatile) than bitcoin. And which consequently, makes bitcoin so attractive.
Furthermore - for I am now conscious we could be setting a world record for the longest discussion on a reddit sub - I don't think applying standard economic theory to bitcoin really works either. 
Bitcoin is deflationary. There has never been anything like it. It's supply is fixed and reducing. It's almost the eye of the needle we have to pass through to understand what it really means. So talking about supply and demand, goods in society etc is to understand it as rectilinear; which, in my opinion it is not. It is revolutionary and progressively difficult.
And we don't need to wait for a *hyperinflationary event* to occur before we realise bitcoin's benefit. For we will be waiting (unnecessarily) a long time.

Whatever made you get involved in bitcoin in the first place, hasn't changed and never will. This other stuff going on is not worth worrying about. That type of thinking - dare I say neurosis - belongs to the rat race Ver, Wright and Ayre are so consumed with. Rise above it. Bitcoin always does (even if it swings us around the block a bit too hairy for our liking from time to time)
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:46:22
Yes, very well said.
As an aside, when I hear bitcoin is volatile what I take it to mean the $ to btc price action is volatile (and always will be). 
Whilst this may sound like splitting hairs, bitcoin itself doesn't actually change - despite the hullabaloo which surrounds it.
And as the dollar increasingly looks for a real store of value and bitcoin gains new adherents (for the reasons you have given above - for it is questionable whether the dollar itself is a store of value at all), expect more volatility to the dollar price as we head for the moon.
If you agree with this, [you might enjoy this take on it all.](

Let me share a secret with you. 
Before Satoshi devised bitcoin, he was a cocktail waiter. And before that, served many years in wholesale banking. Before that, corporate finance.
Anyway, point is. When serving cocktails, for the most part the customer's were polite and appreciative. They ordered the drinks, Satoshi served them up. Not so flashy, but just enough to be eye-catching. And there was always just slightly more to Satoshi than met the eye. Most of the punters and his colleagues loved him.
But from time to time, you'd get a chancer. You know the type, nothing was ever enough. And they always wanted more.
So Satoshi devised a special cocktail for this type of customer. It was called *Satoshi's Revenge*. What was in it? I can't say for sure. But what I can tell you is this: once drunk, it went down like a mellifluous orchestra on the throat. My God! Unbelievable. It seemed like the answer to everything.
It was so light; lighter than light. The gravity creating cadence of the drink had the punter nailed to the floor. And made him want another; and then again. And so on.
That was the Satoshi part of the cocktail. The revenge part. Well, I leave you to imagine how unpleasant that became when regurgitated.....
Point is. Nothing is ever different. Sometimes (always) more is never enough and ends up being nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:33:24
This is what happens when the symposium bottlenecks knowledge by talking about distributed value.
Get ready to be downvoted, because bitcoin is not a community for three reasons:
1. Bitcoin works to a cryptographic consensus, not a social consensus (see point 2)
2. Bitcoin is as much a community as the dollar is a community (see point 3)
3. Altruism does not work for the cypherpunk, which will always grow tired of self appointed leaders (see point 1)
This is why Andreas looks ever more exhausted.

I don't think he was as direct as you've made out. For example, to say *And illustrates how they can't be trusted* 
contrasts with [Satoshi's words]( of *While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.*
And I can't find anywhere Satoshi saying 'eliminate'. To repeat above, the white paper says *the system works well enough for most transactions*

Yes, I agree and this is often misunderstood.


This is where I disagree. I accept historically, this is what we could expect to happen. However, what we now have is a technology driven world. And the effects of technology have been deflationary. This is because technology is time-saving, capacity increasing which reduces the emphasis on human input, therefore wage pressure and therefore avoiding inflationary spirals.
Thankfully, there is now bitcoin. Without it, it would be difficult to predict how centralised money would continue to work in a world decentralised by technology. I can only suggest, demand would eventually dissipate to being non-existent and things would become impossibly dysfunctional ie an unimaginable break down in trust

so you've replied twice. Was half way through typing my first response and the phone conked out. So I've taken the trouble to get out of bed and write this. Apologies if you don't get any response for a few hours.
A cryptographic consensus is fundamentally different to a social consensus (which is corruptible and influenced) by its very nature.
Yes a bitcoin can be compared to a dollar - for they are both relative to each other. But they are not the same. And neither do either work on social consensus - take the old joke about economists for example - get nine together and they arrive at ten opinions. And one more who dies of rigamortis trying to understand fiscal and monetary policy


I don't understand your point on this? How is bitcoin altruistic?


I don't understand this either. Yes, BCH exists but it hasn't broken the bitcoin blockchain. Rather the opposite.
And finally. The community social/consensus thing. You get Roger Ver, Craig White, Jimmy Song, Nick Szabo, Hal Finney (warmed up), Charlie Lee, Charlie Shrem, Andreas A, Me, You in a room. You got a consensus? No. You got a community? No. You got something that potentially could be a community? Yes, if you want to use that kind of language. 
But who cares about it? Most people who talk bitcoin, want to talk the dollar. But do most people who talk the dollar, want to talk bitcoin? No. Why? Coz its something more involved

@_date: 2017-11-01 21:30:32
But the Satoshi's Time's reference to the financial crisis wasn't bitcoin's starting point. The starting point (the opening line to the white paper) is (quote) *Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments.  While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes.* 
It's starting point is commerce on the internet, not financial crisis.
However, I understand where you are coming from. I believe above all Satoshi was a pragmatist and probably totally irreverent - ie his opening line could well have been devised about three quarters of the way through his thinking on bitcoin. He may have known by overtly presenting bitcoin as an anti-bank mechanism, it would have put up immediate resistance and painted him/her/them in an ideological light. And I don't think that was really where him/her/them were/are coming from

@_date: 2017-11-10 22:36:03


Janet Yellen admitted recently the Fed are struggling to hit their inflation targets. Someone from the Bank of International Settlements (the Central Bank of Central Bank's) more recently - and more significantly - admitted Central Banks do not understand inflation.
Hyperinflation in the developed world (with professionally managed monetary systems) will not return, that is for sure. It is one of Central Bank's biggest problems - that they've tried desperately to create inflation, but can't.
This article is thought provoking. I've skim read it and can see where the author is coming from, however I believe a few important facts are being passed over or reaching erroneous conclusions - especially the numbers regarding inflation (where are they coming from?) and the costs of chargebacks and fraud (Satoshi's starting point).
Regulators will take a different view on proof-of-stake blockchains to POW. For they (POS) place a different emphasis on trust and therefore will have different oversight requirements. They are almost re-inventing the wheel

I read that article on today's Times and I thought Mr Saluzzi's comments were fair. And by the way, bitcoin wasn't launched because of the banking crisis -  at least not in a way that can be directly referenced in the white paper. The opening lines (beyond the abstract) unequivocally state that payment reversals for e-commerce are a problem. Attempts to create digital cash were made well before the banking problems of 2008

It has become apparent for a while now the accepted bitcoin narrative of Andreas and Szabo may be misdirected. Not wrong, but only part right - and easily scripted - which means the same thing gets said over.
I'm unaware either Andreas or Szabo have said anything about how a bitcoin world bought forward will look? How will we consume? It seems to be about how money has evolved previously around a hackneyed message of inflation resistant, anti censorship money outside the control of banks.
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:10:50
What I was trying to get at here, is that unless we begin to understand cash in a way that we haven't either now or previously; then the qualitative difference between bitcoin and previous and current money forms remains overlooked.
And at risk of becoming a pariah, I don't think is enough to say bitcoin is qualitively about inflation resistant, anti censorship money without need of a bank.

When I watched the [presentation pinned on her twitter page]( I initially had to overcome an annoyance that she finishes her sentences like she was asking question (ie she is unsure of what she is saying). 
However, being a true good old fashioned snobby Brit; I'm aware this is a frequent habit amongst new world English speakers (especially the Aussies) so I decided not to let poor translation on my part spoil this.
So having got through the initially resistance, I was impressed by Ms Stark and thought she delivered a strong presentation.

Exactly (although contentious). We have no memory of barter. Just as I personally don't have a memory of pre-fiat commodity money, but do have a memory and knowledge of fiat money and post fiat (bitcoin). Therefore Mises regression theorem is satisfied (by how different mediums of exchange become translated into each other by a time component).
I don't think this changes Szabo's general point that advances in technologies allow social advance; at this juncture through trustless software (which I admit are not 100% trustless, but the general point is still valid).

This is the Nash Equilibrium. A state where everyone knows their protagonists strategy; and won't change their own as a result.
So once this state is reached, the next stage of the game is contemplated. And Nash provided this solution.
Only Nash (or we) doesn't know the next stage, only that a solution has been reached (the Nash Equilibrium). Suffice to say we are going there.

Is this undesirable? A cash system which draws upon unfettered energy is going to have universal qualities. And if bitcoin transforms our understanding of scarcity allocating monies and markets; then the trust minimising software as a result will alter our customs and cultures. The way we experience our thoughts and approach language will change as the volume is removed. Scaling will become a cadence. A style. Through life. Memory may shorten, become detached. The immediacy of our material surround overwhelming. The network optimises our imagination. Authenticity becomes intuitive and totally trustless.

This is exactly on the money. Or the coin. Or the general thingy; whatever we call it.
Currencies right now are trading in a false paradigm. They have been sheltered from volatile storms by retreating to - and existing in - closed systems and captive markets.
Wealth contained in this system of fiat, isn't really wealth. Its tokens by laws and rules discouraging free movement. It's a mimic.
Having said this, anger is pointless and parody everywhere. Unconditional freedoms are impossible. We have to accept dollar volatility. The blockchain technology in itself isn't volatile: but the timing of it makes our homes inhabitable to the loosest of cannons.

Thanks for posting, this is great reading and goes right to the heart also of Nick Szabo's work (I know the author is attributing this to Andreas but I think similar points are being covered); that trustless* technology can leverage social scaling (which I think is something we don't often speak about when we talk about 'scaling', it is more commonly associated with discussions about decentralisation and blocksizes etc).
Possibly 'scaling' is not a great word for what is meant here, but that's a minor quibble. At the basic level it probably means social relationships without war and society at peace, where a premium is placed on co-operation (not competition). This might sound a little off topic, but a quirky description of how such a social order may sound can be found in this [scene from Easy Rider]( where George (Jack Nicholson) talks about world's in the universe that can house, clothe and feed themselves with ease and without wars or leaders and all because they have the technology. Have a watch, about four minutes in (I don't condone drugs btw). 
Back to the question on bitcoin, if we look at the modern developed economies, they work on higher levels of trust because their institutions have become more evolved and reliable than say third world countries (which makes doing business easier). Still however, it is always possible for trust to break down and as Szabo often [iterates]( trusted third parties are lawyer magnets.
So for sure, if bitcoin is not about the money; then a peer to peer electronic cash may materialise in a cadence and language so pregnant in consequence we might find difficult to imagine given our present condition. This maybe what is meant by scaling and maybe why bitcoin isn't about the money - and as it becomes increasingly dollar rich, our memories shorten as we are increasingly less concerned with the dollar price at all

Small casual payments that bank overheads make difficult in today's finance. It's why there is a Satoshi  of a bitcoin ie .00000001 and why the Lightning Network is coming (or one of the reasons) so as the world and devices become more interconnected and networked, such transfers are possible. Otherwise known as micropayments. So if 1$ was ever worth 1sat , then imagine how many $ would have to be created because the total M1 (narrow money ie the most liquid form - cash) supply would be parabolic in comparison to now; but this is what is meant by 'optimal' when economists manage the money supply ; making sure there is enough money in times of growth. Just as an athlete requires more calories when in training than a normal sedatory person. At this point however the Central Bank guide to money just got ripped up. On the way to this state of affairs though, they will have to react in some way or other. Maybe as the market cap of bitcoin begins to encroach on the cap of gold?

when alt coin tech pitches are considered, they sound good (fantastic, other worldly; even). Foremost because they have been afforded the luxury of time - being able to take a step back, consider a value proposition and deliver on popularly conceived short fallings of bitcoin.
And lets face it: the best of the alt coins have great ideas; many of which will come to fruition.
However, the thing is - is my belief anyway, kill me if you want - is the great crypto ideas are best delivered on sound, well constructed base layer development. That's the reality of it. Or in other words; Core.
That is why I'm excited about LN. And it's only just the start.

@_date: 2018-02-20 15:00:21
If bitcoin is causing regret, it's not doing it right.
Way I look at it is this : what is a currency other than *what is now* ? A currency enables consumption. What is consumption other than *take it in* ? So to take it in, now; requires a departure with how we've become used to money. And this is something bitcoin adoption will have to understand, because there is no point it aping fiat and Visa etc. 
In this respect, it will challenge what is meant by stable? As in i was stable I didn't get in at bitcoin @ 10c. I am stable I got in @ $10k. The missing out is irrelevant in a time-stamped energy proofed network: it's the consensus that counts.
The technology (Core, Lightning Network, Seg Wit) is lined up - for sure - but what it means is still very much a frontier uninhabited. 
And a Bitcoin Regret Club is very much in the Caravans and tents too safely secured behind the real action.

@_date: 2018-03-20 23:07:14


In considering a reply, I'd like to take this back a step.
What is the most re-occurring discussion in bitcoin? Scaling. I'm sure you'll agree.
The thing with the scaling discussion, is it centres around decentralisation as a trade off against users who can use bitcoin without paying large fees or suffering slow transaction times. I'm sure you'll agree with that too.
Hence constant discussion, dialogue, bickering between different interest groups which rarely go into some of the assumptions about what Satoshi meant by a *peer to peer electronic cash system*.
What did he mean by peers? Not just how many peers did he envisage; but what did he *mean* by peers? And what did he mean by cash? Other than obvious definitions of immediate purchasing power without an intermediary.
And so we then go back to the well trodden path about decentralisation and the reach of a blockchain.
So let's ask this: what is the point of trust minimising software?
Is it so we allow automation and machines increasingly do our thinking for us, especially when it comes to matter of money? If so, what thoughts are we left with? If the neurosis and the inflation has been taken away; could we cope? If we scale correctly, how would we ever know?
Can our language contemplate such a universe where we don't think as we are used to thinking?
Hence our metaphor which is so used to mediation, runs away from us when such mediation can't be reached.
So in finding the answers, why not consider things beyond our usual horizons? A smooth exit from eternal inflation.
But let me get back to your original question about the universe, because it seems so obvious and the implication is I'm ignorant for not realising this in the first place.
So let me ask this. When Satoshi was talking about a peer to peer electronic cash system, you did understand he was talking about money, right?

@_date: 2018-02-02 19:34:34
Yes ok, I get the basis of the metaphor between bitcoin blockchain and an ecology. However there are fundamental differences between these that don't logically conclude (as far as I can make cognitive sense of).
Firstly and lastly, bitcoin was designed to make micropayments possible (to make bitcoin a *cash* system). The reason this has yet to happen, is the cognitive costs of bitcoin still outweigh the computational costs.
This is a social problem: the problem being acceptance of bitcoin as cash.
To compare this to an *ecology* disregards entirely the problem bitcoin was designed to overcome (mental transaction costs) and is a lazy - and dare I say, ham fisted metaphor - designed to somehow think bitcoin can enter the public consciousness by comparing it to how 'trees communicate'.
Bitcoin has to become intuitive. It has to become language. And calling it 'an ecosystem' and a 'community' won't work.

I think Christine Lagard alludes to that point too, when she talks about Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) which as I understand are a basket of world currencies (somehow or other using a blockchain) to which each Central Bank then peg their inflation setting and monetary policies.
I think by doing this they are trying to overcome the [Triffin dilemma]( and avoid competitive currency devaluations which can lead to potentially greater problems (conflicts).
Personally I don't think this will work because in searching for ideal monetary policy they will at some point realise they are reinventing the wheel (the bitcoin blockchain).

Regret is a condition of the dollar: it works on competition; someone has, someone hasn't. Wish I'd not made that bad choice. I'm going to take drugs. Wish I'd not. Wish I'd. I Just Wish. The reason bitcoin has become so dollar attractive is because of the natural time component: just like bartering moved to commodity money. Then to fiat. Its satisfies the memory of existing prices. Otherwise it wouldn't evolve. The nature of bitcoin and where it is going means its network value only strengthens the more it's accepted. This is why I don't understand a bitcoin regret club. You gonna ruin someone because they accepted bitcoin at the wrong time? And the stroke reference; I assume you want to reduce this to a puerile level? Disappointing.

I don't know if you're aware, but a discussion of Menger and Mises was made on bitcoin talk in the early days. You can find this [here]( and you will see Satoshi himself responds (interestingly, the poster earned himself 20 bitcoins by way of tips for posting)
What it says is bitcoin satisfies Mises regression theorem through the memory of previous prices. This is demonstrated by going back to the earliest forms of monetary exchange: barter. Which then evolved into commodity money. Which then evolved into fiat money (which referenced commodity weight and measures ie dollar and pounds, for example). Bitcoin has then been translated into dollar prices which explains why the earliest bitcoin commercial enterprises were exchanges: it allows a memory of previous money prices to be transalated into cryptocurrency.
I don't agree with your subsequent points about bitcoin to become money has to mirror or improve upon the functionality of current payment systems ie transaction volume and speed time of Visa.
This ignores the function of bitcoin as reducing *mental transaction costs*, which [Szabo devoted a whole paper]( to in May 1999; which can be the answer to what is bitcoin actually for? (answer: reducing mental transaction costs)
In light of this, there is no mention (please correct me if I'm wrong) about the inchoate nature of energy and time in bitcoin which in themselves can make bitcoin easier understood as natural money or currency. Or any questions raised as to what is in fact meant by currency, or more pertinently *cash*?
I upvoted your submission though, because it raises good questions.

Healthcare has many problems: the first and foremost being insufficient time and resource. The NHS in the UK is pretty much bankrupt - in the States, Obamacare is driven by the same problem. One of the primary drivers of this is a demographic inbalance.
So what does Bitcoin do? One of it's utilities is moving money. Another is a store of wealth. There are others too, but if Bitcoin's superior purchasing power can make healthcare more affordable - and if the technology can dis-intermediate bureaucracy, then that is a good starting point for what Bitcoin can do for the healthcare industry.

Something that often is passed over is there is no real definition of what *cash* actually is. Satoshi never gave a specific definition, probably on purpose. I could try and second guess why, but I'm not sure the normal bitcoin narrative would be that accommodating. I know for sure however the guys at BCH who are working toward another version of Visa without the intermediation or fees have missed the point.

Its a path to which some extent a guy called [Francis Fukuyama]( predicted years ago; how trust can break down and attract reactionary ideas, populist views that make for fractious and costly social interaction. In many ways, the basis of his work is not dis-similar to Nick Szabo; difference being Szabo demonstrates how (trustless) tech can increase social scale by lowering transaction and governance costs.

Interesting. The internet in itself doesn't have a price, but the internet's time saving innovation is what made tech stocks pump - through an allure of the future. Price reflects usefulness and business cycles go round - the collapse of the tech bubble pumping the sub-prime property bubble, whose collapse led to an open source, trustless, immutable and permissionless digital cash ledger which was ground breaking. It revolutionised the commercial landscape, fiscal and regulatory environments. And what will lead people into this break with traditional finance? Its usefulness maybe, but this only means something through price reflection. So then, what if the value of Bitcoin (borderless cash and store of wealth) reflects the global M4 supply (something like $100tn)? That has to be the logical conclusion? If someone asks, why has bitcoin gone up 500%? Is it a bubble? But its not regulated? These are the answers that actually mean something because what if you actually own one or half a one? When kids grow up, they walk into things and fall over before they can run. Same with Bitcoin

So, you mean is it used by criminals? Because if you do mean that, then yes it is. Well that's what I thought. Ok, so just because its used by criminals doesn't mean it isn't a revolutionary technology which delivers growth to honest users who see it's potential. Well, I'm still not sure. I mean, you know - ahem - I don't want to get a criminal record. How is it regulated? Ah right, I get it. You mean can it be taxed? Well, you know.

Yes. Follow Moore's Law. For example, look at the equivalent price in 1992 of today's IPhone - taking into account computing power and storage costs - would be around £1.2mln in today's money. And see how the functionality has evolved. We can do more for less. This is why technology is referred to as disruptive. Look at any field like medicine or finance. More is now possible with the same energy input. Automation as a consequence is suppressing wage demands, meaning prices are coming down. Why else in the age of money printing presses going full tilt, we don't have runaway inflation? Answer, technology. See next how the distributive powers of Bitcoin will restore growth.

To understand this instantly, make a mental note that bitcoin cash left bitcoin (with bigger block sizes) that's why it slants the way it does. Bitcoin slants right because it will always be the real bitcoin (and therefore right). A bit childish I know, but again hope it helps! :)

The difference between a full client and SPV is that with SPV you *could* have the equivalent of digital fools gold. Whilst unlikely, it means a light client is not completely trustless. Which is one of the key points of bitcoin. To dismiss it as paranoid or a waste of resources is - dare I say - to misunderstand the origins of bitcoin.
And that is why you will find resistance to bigger blocks on this sub-reddit, for - in my opinion at least - valid reasons: it is only by running a full client that you know the bitcoin you have is 100% real. You are not trusting anything other than the energy intensity and cryptographic rules of the bitcoin blockchain.

Decentralised exchanges are the natural extension of the internet, which can't be un-invented. They are without order books and transaction fees. This is why banning bitcoin is a third world problem. And no-one wants the first world more than the third. James likes to play devil's advocate, I think because he gets tired of the bitcoin cheerleaders and their rote.

@_date: 2017-10-04 16:39:14
Good points you raise. Hopefully this will try and answer
In my experience, any business can be measured with three easy to understand matrix: sales, margins, cash.
The biggest problem with brexit for British business who import from the Eurozone is it reduces margins to the point of death (because of weakened Sterling). See [Monarch Airlines](
But never mind holidays, energy is a necessity used by everyone. So energy companies are increasing bills because of declining margins.
This is where inflation becomes a problem, because of currency devaluation.
Let me give an example. Since Brexit, sterling has declined against the euro c.5-10%. In the same time, bitcoin has appreciated in value c.500% (against sterling).
So if energy companies were to give customers the *option* of paying in bitcoin, it would make sense for them to give a discount to do so. At the least, they could give it away as a loyalty reward.
Bills would become cheaper, the energy companies bottom line would increase and the novelty alone (USP) of an energy company adopting bitcoin should attract more sales. This sub-reddit alone is attracting c.5% more users a week.
Energy companies work on paper thin margins at it is (around 4-6%).
They have no choice but to either innovate or die. Otherwise, the government may as well re-nationalise them and socialise the costs.
And at that point, we all become poorer

If your talking 'Keynesian' economics, their tactics are money optimal. That means making sure there is enough money in times of growth, enough in times of retraction to protect against catastrophic illiquidity. That's how they make their living - or at least justify it - by the management of the macro situation.
Shortening the business cycle; whatever you want to call it: they target inflation, but how they measure inflation will at some point have to take into account bitcoin. Don't forget the productive capacity and reducing scaled costs of technology have dispelled what we understand as traditional notions of inflation.
Unless bitcoin moves too quick for them. Which is possible.
Moreover, bitcoin is designed for a micro world. Not a macro one. I think more central bankers are aware of this than they let on - I mean, given their situation; how could they?

Very clear explanation, makes perfect sense


This is the killer sentence - I can see where your economics background comes in: perfect markets can only function with complete information, right?
Thanks for your reply, I was interested when you mentioned *socialising* (bitcoin) because I associate that phrase with relativity ie how people relate themselves, their wealth and money to others, but never really have a true picture so they try and work it from incomplete information or mis-leading impressions - which is exactly what bitcoin cash has the potential to do and is the weakness with many alt coins and the way their blockchain's work.
At risk of going off on a tangent, it (socialising) also makes me think of Einstein, how his enquiry strived to establish a theory on time and relativity but as soon as he had done so, it became troubled by the sub-atomic world.
I see this is what bitcoin is doing to the regular financial world -  which of course makes it big business and its no wonder many different actors are looking for an angle and slice of the action. But they are measuring it in dollars for the sake of dollars, not the transformational potential of bitcoin.
For what its worth (probably not much) I regard decentralisation as an essential feature of bitcoin, but not its actual benefit. I think the actual benefit of bitcoin is time itself. And I believe eventually, that is how it will become socialised.
What I mean by this, is that the period of austerity, low growth and the losing battle fiat money is fighting against inflation will see lots of people (especially the shrinking first world middle classes) realise bitcoin - and only the true version of bitcoin - help them on their way through life.
Specifically, if this is to be socialised then the art and culture around the genius of the technology has to be *laterally* about bitcoin and not just literally - by this I mean leveraging the borderless and permissionless nature of bitcoin and make the language migratory and - returning to its roots - punkish

The tautology being we are talking cryptocurrency. And we define that as anti-dollar (but legitimised by dollar predictions).
And that's the absurdity.
It's both double speak and nonsense.
Yet we keep swinging for the million dollar branch.
Which is ok. 
That is how it is.

Yes, I know what you mean. I sometimes have bitcoin spending regrets, but they don't last for long and usually reinforce my convictions and belief in what is happening and is about to happen. In fact, I sometimes wonder if holding a whole bitcoin will be healthy as time moves on (which probably seems like a risible thing to say!) but imagine the purchasing power when $1 = 1SAT... it could literally be too much for one person to handle and this is where the hodl mind-set begins to unwind

That kind of thinking about blockchain (as a corporate innovation) will lead to digging a hole with no bottom. And $ billions then being poured into it. Lost forever.
Let me elaborate. 
Yes, I take your point about disintermediation. So I ask this - would you say the point of bitcoin is blockchain, but the point of blockchain is disintermediation? And is the point of disintermediation cost saving? And the point of cost saving can only be measured and rewarded in dollars?
This is not addressing the point you make about non-bitcoin blockchains being more trustless. Which over-looks the essential features of bitcoin being non-Turing complete, proof of work (not proof of stake), deflationary and which works to an open source consensus.
Lets imagine in your world that transaction costs for a stock trade are permanently reduced to zero. So what? Is this what you understand by blockchain?
@_date: 2017-10-09 08:39:07
Good philosophy. 
Bitcoin has sort of honed my thinking that wealth is an accumulation and dispersing of knowledge (without caveats). 
I like how it creates a logic consensus which shows up redundancy in existing social thought.
I know the dollar price is important, but sometimes get a little frustrated when it becomes the be all and end all - it is only the starting point.
Bitcoin will end up transforming wealth into something much more imaginative as adoption gradually increases. Eventually it should take us into a world where value isn't monetized at all

Bitcoin isn't money. It acts *like* money (for the time being), but it *isn't* money. The more bitcoin is understood like this (as a $ value), the less it is understood.

bitcoin price action will always be volatile in a way we find difficult to imagine. Bitcoin fundamentals however will never change. I wrote my post in response to someone saying *when* money gets volatile. My point is money *is* volatile right now - sit in the dollar, you lose.

Why 2x? Greater transaction capacity, lower fees - putting bitcoin in a stronger position to challenge established payment networks, achieving wider adoption and commercial advantage over shorter time frames.

@_date: 2017-10-10 18:07:29
Bitcoin can only handle a fraction of Visa's transactions, at a greater cost (currently) which is a problem for those (businesses who have invested in bitcoin infrastructure) who want to Bitcoin to compete with other established payment networks and become an alternative medium for exchange.
This issue has existed ever since bitcoin became popular - the more it was used, the more it became an issue to be used more and become adopted on Main Street (US) High Street (UK) and in ubiquity everywhere else.
In 2017 it was proposed to implement Seg Wit (which is exponential in its working of blocks compared to increasing and limiting block sizes) and also double the block size (from 1MB to 2MB). This is known as Segwit 2x and was agreed in the NYA (New York Agreement) signatories including key actors, agents, enterprises, ego's and other characters that make up this wild west type saloon. 
The doubling of the block size to 2MB is due to be implemented sometime mid-November 2017.
This is not popular with bitcoin users who don't like bigger block sizes (as it means running a full node - or validation of the bitcoin blockchain) becomes more expensive due to the increased computational power required and leads to less decentralisation and more trust (in financial institutions), which for bitcoiners (and I personally agree with this) is the antithesis of bitcoin.
So now, the idea of a fork to a 2MB blocksize is becoming as unpopular as Bitcoin Cash (which works on 8MB block limits).
The question asked is a good, simple and valid question. The answer however is exhaustive. You can only really reach the answer by getting to the bottom of the issue yourself, it won't be found in an *idiots guide to bitcoin forks* because of it's very nature.
I hope this helps

Fiats are going to get unstable? They *are* instable. Wherever the cost of living (popularly understood as inflation) is higher than the return on money (popularly understood through interest rates) as it is in all developed countries **at the moment**, then you have instability. The fundamentals of bitcoin will never change, which makes it much more stable than any form of money. The *bitcoin is not stable enough to be a currency* argument has no fundamental basis to it. Its a nonsense. Never mind bitcoin performance against the dollar, look at the dollar's performance against bitcoin. The flat line on that graph shows up real volatility

I might be wrong, but I put the FT's general scepticism of bitcoin and blockchain down to two things: 1) like much of the legacy media, they don't like how the internet has disrupted their business models - not least the carving up of advertising revenue and challenging how content is monetized; and 2) its called the Financial Times, not the Blockchain Times. And therein lays the culture conflict - one is rooted in tradition, the other paves a new path.

I don't believe bitcoin will ever stabilise and I don't really understand why we want it to. Having the ability to short the price will probably exacerbate volatility further due to liquidations if the market is called in the wrong direction (squeezes).
As retailers and merchants begin to aggressively discount their $ prices for bitcoin, is when we start to see sharp moves in the price. This will spell the end of financialisation as the digital gold rush gets into full swing
Bitcoin will never *be* money in the way we understand money now, but it can be *like* money for a short while. After that, it will begin to take on a reality of its own.

The blog is aimed at a macro level of how bitcoin can become money, ie if Central Banks use bitcoin as a standard by which to optimise (through an inflation target). And once money becomes optimal in this way, it can then become Ideal.
The blog is not easy reading and I know the author believes the popular bitcoin narrative encourages the audience to 'hot wire' the meaning and purpose of bitcoin. For example, he believes Andreas is a rhetorician.

Yes, I agree. Which I think is one of the reasons Christine Laggard made the announcement this week - it marks a shift in the IMF's attitude to cryptocurrency and bitcoin, for this very reason you've just mentioned.
Also, the OP quoting Satoshi is spot on. A subtle point perhaps missed about the central bank being trusted not to debase the currency, is that Satoshi used this basis of reasoning to develop something akin to a neo-gold like standard (bitcoin).
And if this is used as a beacon for targeting (by central banks), currencies can begin to stabilise in relation to each other; bringing the world and nations into order - overcoming the problems of competitive devaluations and Triffin Dilemma.

Charge backs and fraud are the biggest problem to the financial system today and people who use it (even if they don't realise).
Same as it was late last decade when bitcoin was invented. Satoshi admitted for most of the time, things work ok; but trust is a problem. Especially when it breaks down.
And especially for retailers selling big tickets. Bitcoin works perfectly now and possesses the functionality it was designed for - which is to overcome the problem of reversible payments. 
The way bitcoin has been bastardised since (with the so called blockchain industry), to fit different narratives is ok - but just don't lose sight of where it came from.
