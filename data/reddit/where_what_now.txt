.0001 BTC
Something was wrong with a website I was using and even though the address clearly had the right amount the website was reporting one Satoshi less. I didn't want to wait around for support so I figured I'd just send the extra amount. Of course then it got stuck and I ended up waiting anyway.
I've contacted the website support about the issue so hopefully they can explain what happened.

First, I would contact the leader of the meetup group and express your concerns. There's no reason "someone like you" should feel uncomfortable and I think a responsible meetup leader would be happy to assist you. Especially if it was a particular individual that was to blame.
Second, even if a meetup leader is incapable of addressing these kinds of issues the people in charge of a conference definitely will be. My advice? Go to whatever conferences interest you and don't worry about who you are. If someone gives you trouble about it simply contact security.

Until the general public becomes technologically educated enough to pull off a double spend it really doesn't affect merchants at all. Most people wouldn't have the faintest idea. Not many more than already know how to commit credit card fraud. Even then it's still a safer option for the merchant whether they're online or a brick and mortar shop.
First, online merchants could simply alter their online carts to allow the user to leave the page while the transaction confirms. If the user pulls a double spend the order is cancelled. No harm, no foul.
Second, physical merchants already deal with shop lifting and people who dine and dash. Both of these are way easier to pull off than a double spend and in the case of shop lifting the merchant doesn't even know what happened. In the case of a double spend they probably have you on camera and can alert the authorities if necessary or just deny you from entering their store ever again. In the occasions where customers are purchasing big ticket items shops could simply encourage customers to purchase those immediately and browse the store while they wait for the transaction to confirm.
Nothing about these transaction lengths makes or breaks the usefulness of the network as a payment processor.

@_date: 2015-03-19 06:43:17


Ah well that explains it a bit.
I don't think writing the official core would result in more developers. Plenty of people have started porting and writing wrapper libraries in lots of different languages and that's fantastic in my opinion. I'm glad needs are being met by the community on that front.
I *do* think we'd have more people *reviewing* the core code if it were written in a higher level language. Not so high that the core library is littered with caveats due to the language (bit/byte manipulation), but not so low that there's a lot of unnecessary code (memory management).


Well we disagree there. I think the fact that in Python you have to work around dynamic typing abstraction would make the core library more difficult to understand than if it were in C# or Java for the reasons I've stated above.
And don't get me wrong, I've worked with Python and I think it's a great language. I just don't think it's the right tool for this job.
@_date: 2015-03-18 17:13:09

I'm not completely opposed to the idea but working with bits/bytes in Python can be tricky. Dynamic type languages aren't really intended for that sort of thing. Of course it can be done but there are certain caveats that an experienced Python developer would know to watch out for but a developer who's porting it to their language of choice may not be aware of.
By comparison C have less of these subtle nuances while still being fairly easy to understand.

No you're still missing something. What I'm not sure.
Let's say you wanted a specific kind of chocolate chip muffins. Say nobody makes muffins with those chocolate chips. So rather than making your own chocolate chip muffins you go to the store and buy some plain pre-made muffins and shove in chocolate chips. Writing an application that does a lot of bit/byte manipulations in a language that isn't designed to do that is very much the same. You select the abstracted approach and then hack your way around it to fit your needs.


My suggestion to port the code to another language was meant to increase the number of developers who could easily understand the core library. Keeping C/C++ and throwing Python into the mix on top of it all would be completely counter productive in that regard.

Ah I see the confusion. When I say "full transparency" I'm talking about the transparency of the entire system. Not just the ledger.
I mean I already have a bank account that I manage online. I keep a close eye on it so there's no chance someone came in and changed numbers on my account without me knowing. That's one level of transparency. 
A ledger that shows transactions on a wider scale is certainly a higher level of transparency but the system as a whole still isn't anywhere near "fully transparent". As there are more aspects to be considered.
Take for example the creation of new bitcoins. That process is transparent: "Here's the puzzle, try to solve it before anybody else." A centralized financial system will most definitely include some mechanism for injecting newly minted tokens into the ledger. How many get injected and at what frequency? Who do the tokens go to? And most importantly who makes these decisions?
So maybe my claim that "centralized" and "fully transparent" are conflicting terms is an exaggeration. I do know I can't think of a way a group of bodies could design a system in such a way that includes everyone in every aspect of the system any better than the Bitcoin protocol.

Apple pay isn't secure whether you use it or not. You have no idea how many apple employees have authorized remote access to your phone and how many more could gain unauthorized remote access easily.
It's *insured* against these security vulnerabilities because if something happens Apple will foot the bill.


Bitcoin still has *less* security issues than Apple pay. (Note I said Bitcoin is *most* secure. Not that it's security and the security of devices we use to handle it. couldn't be improved.) However it is not *insured* which means if something goes wrong you're paying for it. And yes that's tricky.

I've never met a C/C++ programmer who couldn't take a look at C code and understand it fairly easily. The same cannot be said for C developers looking at C/C++.
Moving the official protocol to another language would increase the number of people who are capable of understanding it.
Of course my assumption here is that the bitcoin client doesn't significantly benefit from manual memory management. However as I've said I haven't looked at the source so if I'm wrong please correct me. (And explain how?)
@_date: 2015-03-15 08:07:20


I think you're misunderstanding abstraction works. Abstraction means "I don't care about these details. Hide them from me." Except in the case of a Bitcoin client (or almost any network protocol client) you *do* care about those details. So yes Python does abstract this kind of thing away and in doing so it makes development of a protocol client more difficult.
Take the following two examples of a SHA1 implementation in C# and Python:  
  
  
Obviously bits and bytes are extremely important in this context. In Python this means having an understanding of how it abstracts the types away. In C# you can see it plainly since the type handling is completely explicit.

The block chain does make it easier for people to *force* governments to use a transparent and automated payment network. But if this happened the fed would disappear... indeed the entire concept of government would change drastically.
@_date: 2015-03-06 06:18:18


Erm. I think you have some misconceptions about digital security and how digital payment systems work. In order for a digital transaction to occur there must be some level of confidence that the individual who placed the transaction is who they claim to be. This necessitates the need for some information to kept private. To be kept *secure*. There is no modern payment system that doesn't require any security at all. (That isn't to say it will never be invented. But nothing like that exists today.)


I think what you're trying to say is that Apple doesn't store your information on their servers. That's not much of a comfort at best. See, Apple pay *does* store your credit card information on the phone at the very least. See:


Secret information has been saved to the phone which means if someone gains access to your phone they can create transactions on your behalf. This is one aspect of digital security; keeping unauthorized individuals from having access to the hardware. 
With regard to the claim that Apple doesn't store your credit card information on their servers I'm not actually sure that's the case. I don't have an iPhone but it sounds like Passbook syncs across devices which means at the very least your credit card information passes through their servers so it can be delivered to your other devices. Regardless there is no guarantee that Apple doesn't have the ability to grab information off your phone at anytime. Whatever the case it is likely that if Apple's servers were compromised your credit card information would be compromised as well.
So you see digital security is still required with Apple pay and it is *less secure* than Bitcoin because there are a lot more attack vectors both known and unknown. However Apple and major credit card companies *insure* consumers so that should a security breach occur they are not liable for the charges. Bitcoin has no insurance.
The reality is the general public's understanding of "digital security" is laughable. Any digital device that is connected to the internet is not secure. A lot more people have fully authorized access to your devices than you realize and even more could easily gain unauthorized access.

I'm a developer and the biggest issue for me is that the code is all in C/C++. I don't work with low level languages and I can't devote that much time to learning it for this purpose alone.
 
The more people there are who understand the protocol the better. To my knowledge there's nothing seriously advantageous about using such a low level language to define the protocol. In my opinion that means steps should be taken to define the official protocol in a language that's more accessible. I'd suggest Java as a good option and given that the .Net core was recently open sourced C# is a good option as well.
And don't get me wrong, I don't think that C/C++ clients should be abandoned. I believe they would continue to thrive as there are environments which would benefit from a client written in these languages. But it is much easier for a C++ developer to understand a higher level language than it is for a high level language developer to understand C++.
@_date: 2015-03-05 03:57:05
Why do they point out that Paypal gets your credit card information but fail to mention that's also the case on Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google wallet? Just because it's stored on the phone doesn't mean it can't be/isn't accessed.
If they wanted to be technically correct they should make a distinction between "secure" and "insured". Bitcoin is the most secure but Apple has better insurance against fraud. I can understand why people would prefer a payment option with better insurance but at least educate the public on what it is they're choosing.
