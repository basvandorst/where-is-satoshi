To all those posting the number of bitcoin they hold, you may be making yourselves targets for hackers. Be cautious connecting your user name with your holdings.

It's not my blog, just found the analysis interesting in light of seeing bitcoin hit 7.88 CAD on MTGOX

Anyone else want to weigh in on this.. I still have a sizable amount of money invested in a ppt deposit account. Thoughts?

I ordered a Jalapeno and a new Bitforce SC, we will see in october (hopefully) They are dreadfully slow at replying to e-mails at present -- I think they've gotten over 2000 preorders so far..

If you want something quickly, you could order an Asicminer Blade... 10gh/s for 50btc. 
See the sales thread:

Actually, they can mine Freicoin, PPCoin, and Terracoin, in addition to the merge-mined coins. It would be pretty obvious if they were mining alt-coins.

Google auth does not store your 'secret' in iphone backups.
If you have access to your original iphone, get it from there, otherwise you must contact bitfunder administrators and have them disable two-factor auth on your account.
Two options for the future:
1) Take a photo / write down the secret provided initially and store it somewhere physically SAFE.
2) Use an app like Authy which will store encrypted backups of your various secrets allowing you to migrate phones.

How many characters is your password... Lets see if this is feasable.

Yes, if the difficulty drops then it is profitable for a fraction of a day.
This is the premise behind a multipool, a pool that switches between SCRYPT based coins depending on what's more profitable to mine - you point your miner software at it, and it does everything on the back end, it keeps something like 8 wallets on the server for your alt coins and you are always mining the most profitable one automatically. I personally have my ASICs pointed at BTCGuild and  my GPUS pointed at multipool. It's how you win at life.

Moving averages crossed hard a little bit ago. Trade bots initiated massive sell off at market price. I'd get out now.
