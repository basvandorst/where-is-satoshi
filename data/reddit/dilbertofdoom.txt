I think chokepoint tactics are why Backpage.com moved to bitcoin.  They're still in business too!

Do you support converting say 50btc a day to fiat?  Euro or Dollar is the preferred fiat.  Do you offer business accounts?

Thank you!

I like where you're going with this but you need to think of costs if you want people to do this using their own resources.  Something using a raspberrypi2 and external hard drive would be ideal to keep costs minimal.  Keep the costs under $100 and you'll have more traction with the idea.

Then we're just making bitcoin for us the few instead of the masses?  Aren't merchants necessary to help with adoption?  If bitcoin can't compete with CC companies/banks, then why are we doing all of this?  How can merchants get their voices heard with the same level of seriousness as the miners and developers?

Thank you for your reply.  You make a good point.  However, I do think my original question still remains unanswered.  All of the articles, posts, blog entries never mention what's best for merchants.  It seems like the developers and miners get all the attention.  Though, it's the merchants who stand to lose most if bitcoin never competes on the same transaction levels and fees as the major credit card companies.
If bitcoin is not meant to compete with the major card companies/banks, then what's the point?
Why would we waste our time to develop something so revolutionary just to move funds around for ourselves and never benefit the masses with no bank accounts?

Who should merchants be contacting now then?  I know of several that would like to make their concerns heard but have no idea how to make that happen.  Other than Reddit or similar boards where their posts are ignored.

Do you have more pics of the SSD?  It looks like just the case of the SSD was damaged.  It's possible that you could still plug it into a different machine and access the data on it.

It's mentioned in the article that funds could be lost.  Is that not a big enough doubt to be concerned about safety?

Then how will our congressmen be able to pay their "escorts" without any $100's?  How will rappers make it rain?

Are we really resorting to such juvenile comments and tactics?  It's no wonder the world at large doesn't take bitcoin seriously if we can't behave and act professionally.  I'm very disappointed if this DDoS is because F2Pool wanted to give people options to support their opinion.

Go Celery!!!  Have had nothing but fantastic experiences with them and they fix issues quickly.  Can't recommend them enough.
