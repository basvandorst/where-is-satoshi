How does this apply when a company accepts payments in multiple currencies, though? How can the CC company tell if the prices are the same?

You would expect the extra energy required to earn 1 extra bitcoin in a given time period to cost about 1 bitcoin. Thus energy prices in bitcoin should be more stable, even if everything else moves. Energy prices would only change based on the energy required to earn a bitcoin changed, which could be due to changed mining difficulty and transaction fees. I wonder if large buyers of energy would then want to buy it in bitcoin to reduce volatility.

What if the attacker double-spends at 0 confirmations? Wouldn't there be approximately equal chances of either transaction entering the next block?

Thanks, first two characters are a phonetic transcription of "bit" and the third means "currency", as in Rénmínbì (人民币).

The market is not some kind of magical device that can make everybody rich and moves independently from anybody participating in it. Even an expert trader could lose money, and it's simply not appropriate to be using money that you hold in trust for this kind of trading activity.

There could be a way round that: say you could transfer $10 million by buying $10 million in Bitcoins and then selling them again. It's possible you could just repeat this 100 times. This wouldn't be guaranteed to work, though - exchange rates need to stay stable and the Bitcoin you sold would have to become available for sale again.

Any idea what they base the exchange rate on? Price at a particular exchange etc.

Great point, I'd never thought of this before. What's in it for the electricity company, though - wouldn't they be doubling as Bitcoin speculators? Is there any argument that they would actually prefer to denominate their sales in Bitcoin?

No, it's not "I fuck your mother" currency.
