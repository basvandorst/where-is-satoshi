It’s going to skyrocket the next couple of months I think, but it might go down to 8k first. And watch out for req and VeChain I think and hope they will go up exponentially...

Ironic because crypto is actually anti money laundering, you can trace the money in a way you can’t with regular money. I don’t believe in bitcoin but crypto is definitely the future. Within 4-7 years countries and banks will start making their own

I disagree the value system should be modified, at least 70 % who own it are speculators. It shouldn’t be valued proportional to the capsize of the coin, but whatever you put in you can get out at the same value. Or maybe 80% static and 20% like it is now..

When they fix the volatility and maybe make it a static value system. It’ll work and explode. But right now it’s more pyramid scheme than currency
