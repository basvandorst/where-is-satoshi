Looks like you are in sort of agreement with them... here's their marketesque from their web site: "Use this instead of a risky paper wallet. Just as "compatible" but takes care of generating the private key safely." IMHO removing the word "risky" would have made them seem more credible.

In a legal dispute I wonder how one can prove being the one who paid the bitcoin.

99% of org web site marcoms are female. Okay, maybe just 90%.

Authority is not necessarily governmental, it can be e.g. corporate, religious, social, etc. For me you guys set the rules so you are the authority, and I'm VERY happy with that. While your BDFL-ness is collective it still is authoritative.


Sure, but I was challenging people's perception, not their grammar. Do *you* know Cobra in person?

Not if the PCB is electronically signed in a way verifiable online by OpenDime.
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:27:57
True, but it should be no problem to add to the PCB a service which signs a nonce produced by the OpenDime web site, so the web site could tell you if you're holding a genuine OpenDime hw. This is *not* the private key of the wallet, just a fixed "serial number" burnt into the device.

AFAIK  is an authority as it is the web site maintained by the leadership of the core team. Bitcoin development is centralized and governed by the core team, all this "decentralization" talk is, to some extent, overhyped.
P.s., why is everyone referring to Cobra as "he", it might be a "she".

Ah okay, I get your point, but I don't think that a "bearer bond" is expected to be immune from forgery, you wouldn't place any value on a bond unless you know and trust the issuer (typically a bank in the case of fiat) and can contact them to verify the authenticity of the bond. The bond is not money but a promise to give money. In a transaction of the sort you describe the parties don't really need such an instrument, in btc-sphere they're probably better off just depositing in a multi-sig or using an escrow. My understanding is that the OpenDime is a kinda disposable Trezor, but then maybe I miss some point here.
@_date: 2016-08-17 19:05:14
You don't need to confirm that the device is genuine, only that that particular device (or serial number) is associated with the key generated by the issuer. If the device gets stolen and cloned after issuance then its no different problem than a stolen and cloned Trezor.

Is this a dumb question: If I run mining software, can I influence the mining pool to get my transaction through - regardless of the size of the transaction fee?
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:40:14
Probably can be designed to cost &lt;$1 by implementing it as NFC tag with a peal-off padlock breaker. Can be made water-proof too. One would need a separate reader though, you can get a decent one for ~$8, and it will be good for multiple transactions. Or use the reader built into your phone.

Well, if the machine will never go online then I guess you can trust the browser, but not otherwise. You just cannot tell if any of the form data was stored somewhere, even unintentionally. Browser code is quite a warzone.
@_date: 2016-12-11 21:20:56
It is very simple to audit my code by running it from source sandboxed and see that it isn't saving anything. This is not the case of browsers - browsers _do_ leak data.

Hmm, did I ever suggest using Windows? There's a difference between developing support for a platform and endorsing it.

It is as safe as the password. If the password is random then it is no less safe than any random-generated wallet, just easier to use.

I too was uncomfortable with using a browser-based tool, and I believe that points about bitaddress.org's method of generating its seeds are valid. Which is why I wrote a while ago a tool called [novault]( that addresses pretty much the same issues. Unlike bitaddress and others it is a CLI utility (Binaries available for Windows and Linux, can also run on any platform with Python). It uses two scrypt rounds to generate the seed, and requires a combination of a description and a password, which (at least that's my own experience) lends to better seed management.
It is also a stateless password manager and can generate [silly names]( and [birth dates]( it is designed to manage multiple currencies, and exposes a Python API and can be integrated in other tools.

E-Coin from E-Corp is not unconstitutional. It was once called a bearer bond. And yes, it was legit.

I didn't suggest that Javascript has a problem in random number generation, in fact the main use for `novault` would be as a brain wallet, where you don't need any RNG. My problem is rather with the browser as a platform, as I have no idea what information browsers and their add-ons store and when they transmit that info. Note that you cannot rely on the browser's dev console "Network" tab, it omits lots of stuff.

Good catch, well done noticing. The EFF &amp; TOR offer a browser extension called [HTTPS Everywhere]( that automatically enforces https whenever the web site does not redirect a plain http request.

The 12 word seed is a feature of the client, it is not the BTC private key. It is likely that going forward you will always be able to derive the keys from the seed, but the most future-proof and client-agnostic backup is a backup of the private keys.
@_date: 2016-12-12 10:42:04
This is explained quite extensively in the [novault documentation]( but in a nutshell: novault generates its seeds for password/wallet generation from a combination of master password and a description. If the master password is random then the generated password or wallet is random too. The master password though is typically decided by the user once, memorized, and then used "forever" for all passwords and wallets. This is what I meant in "the main use for...": You can - if you want - use novault to generate your master password, it provides an RNG with key stretching, but this is not its main use; I assume most crypto-literate people already have decent passwords for their computers, email, etc., no need for a new password just for novault.

Having had the same thoughts I wrote some time ago a tool called [novault]( that addresses these issues:
- It is a CLI utility (Binaries available for Windows and Linux, can also run on any platform with Python).
- It uses two scrypt rounds to generate the seed.
- It requires a combination of a description and a password, which (at least that's my own experience) lends to better seed management.
It also has a few other goodies, including:
- It is also a stateless password manager and can generate [silly names]( and [birth dates](
- It is designed to manage multiple currencies, more currencies hopefully coming soon.
- It exposes a Python API and can be integrated in other tools.
I will welcome any reviews and inputs on how to make [novault]( even better.
