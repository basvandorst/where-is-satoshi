Even if that were the case, no court would have found that it was illegal, so the article would still be wrong.

They had freaking reasonable suspicion, it said on the site it sold drugs! (Technically they didn't know it was a third party until after they found it, so it may have been legal, but they couldn't have known until afterwards. So it would have been illegal (possibly) if it had been on his own server in the US. Whether that's valid is an interesting question, but I don't know if there's precedent.)

The other extreme is not allowing any user complaints. Your logic would say that no one can ever complain about anything a company did, with the possible exception of actually illegal actions.


Which rules? Their terms do not mention any restrictions on email.


Would you say the same to someone complaining about Paypal's policies? Obviously nobody is forcing me to use circle, but why is complaining illegitimate?
Would you say the same to someone complaining about Coinbase closing accounts that donated to Gwern?


I've been ID verified and got no bonus, so that doesn't apply.


If they want to disallow some emails, they should at least tell me on signup, or make the policy change public.

If you call anyone using the app stupid for not going through every line of source code themselves, including all of Android's source code, which was part of the bug, then you're setting a very high barrier which I highly doubt even you use. Or have you read the entire code of any wallet you use, plus any operating system it runs on?)

I'm thinking a new vote each retarget. However, if there's no opposition, then it takes very little to maintain/adjust. If there's opposition, then you need to outspend them.
(Perhaps there could be scripts as opposed to simply numbers, which would allow more freedom.)
The beauty of my idea is that it changes all future hard-forks to soft-forks; all miners just refuse to mine on ones with a bad vote, and nodes will **never** have to think about it again.

If less than 50% of miners switch, then the longer chain is the one with shorter blocks, and even exchanges that switched still support that.

They already raised it and the judge pointed out the problem with the request. I doubt that could go through on as a basis for appeal.


They'd have to show why the judge was wrong in denying the testimony (for being filed too late.)
You can't just repeat old arguments in an appeal, you need new ones.
For the "faked screenshots", they'd need to argue against the agents that testified for its credibility, which is different from the corrupt agents.
Again, doubt an appeal has much basis unless there are new arguments.

Maybe I'm not the one who needs to study statistics more.


But not starting from an arbitrary point. If I fork the blockchain starting from block X, 51% means I'll eventually be longer than the mainchain, while .01% means I most likely won't.
I can try forking anew whenever a new block is found, but that won't let me double-spend something from block X+1.

@_date: 2015-06-08 22:56:38
It takes one guy an hour to change the fork so it only allows 1MB blocks that are compatible with all nodes. If 50% do not want larger blocks, they can upgrade to this fork.
All miners mining &gt;1MB blocks will get orphaned automatically, so there's actually a strong inventive not to mine those.
I don't think you've thought through the incentives here. A miner upgrading to the new 1MB fork is just like a miner staying on the same software if the fork is backwards compatable.

You only need to reject blocks with the transaction you wanted to exclude.


So you're saying a hardfork to stop this one chain. Everyone needs to upgrade, and anyone who didn't upgrade stays on my chain.
Also, in the time it takes, the attacker already successfully double-spent.
And this can be repeated, blocking any blocks that build on a competing fork, for as long as attacker has power. That builds an incentive to follow this attacker's proposed rules.

You're right that if you connect to one good node then you'll end up with the right chain, but if you connect to only one node that isn't trustworthy, you have no guarantee that you'll be on the right chain. You can verify the chain, but you don't know if there's a bigger one out there.

Actually no. The government claimed that they found the server legally. Ross challenged that, but refused to claim a personal interest in the server, so that was never ruled on. So as far as we know, it's possible it would have been ruled legal anyway.

Your first point is very minor (no pun intended).
And a small miner must still verify a large block in order to mine on top of it; if they assume that others will be mining on it, they want to as well, but if it's large then they may not be able to store the blockchain anymore, or not have enough bandwidth for incremental changes.
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:06:54


Nope. I start a chain from block X, mine two blocks on it. Send it to you. This chain is X+2 blocks long.
The real chain has X + 100 confirms in the meantime. You don't see it, because you only connected to me.
You have the wrong chain.
@_date: 2015-06-14 17:17:11
 is a mixer. I understand you don't trust third parties, but there's strong reason to trust them in particular, at least to not steal your funds.
They give you a "Letter of Guarantee" signed by their address, so if they ever scam anyone there would be cryptographic proof. So as long as nobody produces a Letter of Guarantee that hasn't been fulfilled, they probably aren't scamming anyone.
(As I understand it, the letter basically says "if btc is sent to addressX by timeY, we will send Z% to addressX2 by timeY2, with limits such and such". So you can see in the blockchain if it's been fulfilled or not.)
This may not be enough for you, just something to think about.

You said it's a few dollars for a test.
But if you don't trust it, first generate the list of transactions using only your public address. Then, save the html file, go offline, generate the actual transaction, and save that. Then you can test it on blockchain.info before uploading it. That way, your private key is never entered while you're online.
You can't do it completely online because it needs to pull your transaction history. (By the way, I confirmed that transactions still pending are included on the list, so you can double spend with it.)

It means that an attacker only needs to compromise a couple of nodes. It's less centralization.
Also, imagine there are 20,000 nodes. To be half the node network, you'd need 20,000 nodes of your own, and would need a lot of IP addresses.
But if there are only 25 nodes, then anyone can make another 25 nodes and be half the network. They can make 100 nodes with unique IPs, and be the vast majority.


It means someone could double spend. I send you chain X with a payment from me to you, so now you think you've been paid. The real chain Y already spent that payment somewhere else.
There's also a standard double-spend attack with preventing you from seeing the double-spend, but that only matters if you accept zero-confs. Even so, less nodes makes it easier to block.
Also, lower nodes means easier to censor, and harder to get cheap anonymity.

If you run your own node, then you have the full security of bitcoin as long as at least one node you connect to is honest. You can only be "fooled" into accepting a shorter chain if nobody that has the longer one can communicate with you. Also, if the fake chain is a lot shorter than the correct one, it will likely have very long gaps in between blocks, or the latest block will be far in the past, increasing suspicion.
If there are few nodes, then it's easier for someone to ensure that you connect only to them.

It's not a perfect analogy to a market with fungible goods, but arguably markets don't need fungible goods (to take an example from the link above, selling dedications.)

It's more complicated than that; even if 95% of miners change, since this is a hard-fork, no exchanges or nodes can be forced onto the new chain. If 95% of miners *don't* change, they can stop the fork assuming it's backwards-compatible with old blocks, but not in reverse.

user their wallets do a terrible job of showing whether or not an
unconfirmed transaction will go through. For example, Schildbach's
Bitcoin wallet for Android has no code at all to detect double-spends
until they get mined, and I've been able to trick it into showing
completely invalid transactions. In fact, currently Bitcoin XT will
relay invalid transactions that are doublepsends, and Schildbach's
wallet displays them as valid, unconfirmed, payments. **It's really no
surprise to me that nearly no-one in the Bitcoin ecosystem accepts
unconfirmed transactions without some kind of protection that doesn't
rely on first-seen-safe mempool behavior.**

If you do this, then it becomes more likely that the zero-fee transaction gets into the block soon.
How impractical would it be to make any sending of deposits back dependant on the deposit? That is, when I deposit money at an exchange, can they set it up that my withdrawal uses the same coins that I sent? Or a subset of those if it's for a lower amount? This would only be needed for until it's confirmed, and would prevent double-spending by any exchange which returns balances.

States v. Bermudez, 413 F.3d 304, 306 (2d Cir. 2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 982(b)(2)). Ulbricht
was involved in laundering many more than three transactions in a twelve-month period,
involving funds worth well beyond $100,000. Silk Road automatically laundered all proceeds
passing through its Bitcoin-based payment system, including by passing them through a
“tumbler” whose sole purpose was to obfuscate the source and nature of the funds. (See GX-

I'm not sure if you get the distinction I made above. Satoshi's comment, implemented in code, causes a hard fork no matter how many people upgrade. Whereas code that checks what percentage of the last X blocks are the new version and only allows larger blocksizes if that percentage is high enough can *only* lead to a hard fork if most miners upgrade. If few miners upgrade, no fork is started.
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:58:56
It was fine to add what Satoshi said, I just pointed out one thing it was missing (which may imply that gavin and co thought about it for longer, or not).
I'm not sure why you consider the second more risk. In the first scenario, what can happen is that 51% move to a new chain, and everyone else is left behind. In the second, only if 95% of mining power has moved can a fork occur. So if 51% move, nothing happens, which is safer. Setting a time and sticking to it no matter what seems strictly riskier than the alternative.

The verse doesn't say that you can't apply logic to religion.


No, that in order to have faith you must reject logic.


Because you're talking about people who don't think that. If you want to say that Christianity means something, that's only a meaningful claim if Christianity is true. If it isn't, you can only look at what people believe. When many people are using logic, you can't say "oh, your religion says you can't use logic", because they don't interpret their religion that way.


So your complaint against religion is one of priors, which while reasonable, is not the same as saying there's "no" proof/logic involved.

@_date: 2015-05-01 02:15:21
tl;dr As of now, it isn't possible, but it may (or may not) be possible in the future.
Long answer ahead. (Disclaimer: I'm not an "expert" in cryptography, but I've read a huge amount on it and related math over the years. If someone who knows what they're talking about says I'm wrong, I'll accept it. I do think this is largely accurate. If you want to understand more, make a list of keywords I mentioned, and read the Wikipedia articles on all of them.)
Here goes:
In theory, public key cryptography should mean that you can't get the private key from public, only the other way around. However, this requires somethig called a "one-way function". Intuitively, this is something that's easy to compute one way, but difficult to reverse.
Quick background on those. There is an open problem in math/theoretical computer science called P=NP. (If you solve it, you win a million dollars! Unfortunately it's very hard.) The question is basically whether the group of all problems that can be solved "quickly" (known as P, which means that the time required for problems as they grow larger increases at worst polynomially with the length of the input), is equal to the group of problems that can be "checked quickly" (NP). IF P does equal NP, then one-way functions cannot exist, although the reverse is not true.
To sum up so far: if P=NP, almost all cryptography used today can be easily broken. (It's slightly more nuanced than that, P could equal NP but there could be no fast algorithms, etc,  but I'm simplifying.)
Now, the good news is that most mathematicians believe P does not equal NP. However, this does not mean your keys are safe. Even if P is not NP, the specific algorithm used may have a quick reversal, the keys may be small enough to brute force, or other possible problems.
Another digression. There's something called NP-complete. That means that for some problems, it can be shown that they are in P if and only if P=NP. So if P is *not* NP, they would be fine. However, not many encryption protocols use NP-complete problems.
RSA uses factoring to achieve asymmetric encryption. Factoring is not known to be NP-complete. ECDSA, which bitcoin uses, is not known to be NP-complete either.
So the ECDSA functions used by bitcoin are not known to be secure, but they aren't known to be insecure either. Except … quantum computers! Yes, there is a known algorithm that will break both RSA and ECDSA while running on a quantum computer. Check out Shor's algorithm.
So currently, the only thing blocking you from getting private keys from public ones is your lack of a quantum computer. Even without one, it's not been *proven* to be secure.
What you can do: luckily, you don't really need to publish public keys until after they are used. You can send bitcoin to the hash, and only reveal the public key when you spend it. Another reason why address reuse is bad.

That's not the claim I made, it's a strawman. The claim I made, which I subsequently clarified, is that the collection of bits that makes up a particular ownership of paycoin is not fraud.

It's not about the trouble, as I've said. I disagree with your premise that it would a good thing for all exchanges would remove coins that fit "well-known infamous scams".

@_date: 2015-05-08 23:03:10


(side note: it's theory, not theorem.) There's a reason I asked you to define evidence before, and even provided you with a link. [Here it is again]( Under that definition, it's (pretty) clear that the Bible is Bayesian evidence for God, and that stories about Zeus are Bayesian evidence for Zeus. They may not be *enough* evidence depending on your prior, but that's different from saying there's *no* evidence.


I'm not going say there aren't priests like that, but there are ones that *will* go over the evidence and arguments with you. The apologetic kinds certainly will.


So if I'm understanding you properly, you're only willing to trust something if it can in theory be verified, because then you trust society as a whole to verify those things, even if you can't yourself. 
There are several problems I see with that. The first, is how do you know what consensus is? (The following may make more sense is you've read  first.) It's easy in many cases to make a convincing argument of what the consensus is in a particular field, which is wrong. All this is to show that "only believe in things that can be proven" really collapses to "only believe in things that you believe can be proven", a much lower standard. Arguably, many if not most theists are following the second standard, and believe there is proof, even if they may be unaware of it.
The second problem is that there are kinds of questions that can't be verified, and you can only go on the evidence you already have. For example, many historical questions, of which certain aspects of religion depend. Above you said that you can independently verify that George Washington existed (or at least that someone is buried in his supposed burial spot), however you haven't, and neither has anyone else as far as we know. I don't see why you think that's any better than not being able to verify at all, or at least you've given no justification.


The word I used was "parapsychology". It usually refers specifically to mind stuff, much narrower than paranormal.


When you do, the following may interest you:




I've been trying to point out that many people follow religion but wouldn't say they are "certain", and it's by no means clear that being 100% sure is a prerequisite.
And what do you mean by "reserving judgement"? Would you say you "reserve" judgement on anything you can't prove (such as vaccines, which you admitted you can't personally prove)? If not, what criteria do you use to determine when to reserve judgement and when not?

I'm not sure what exactly you're doubting; is it that miners might want to harm bitcoin, or that they might end up harming it even if they don't want to? As for the first, today, anyone with 30% can do some pretty damaging stuff, like double-spending very large amounts with high probability. This doesn't make that any easier.
If the second, you should at least give miners credit for being rational.
Otherwise, I'm having a hard time understanding your objection. If making some change (like increasing the blocksize over capacity, possibly) won't be harmful, then why not do it?

Upvoted for being the only one to make that correction. However, your last statement is kinda wrong. The *average* confirmation will tend towards 10 minutes (actually, technically it's 5 minutes, because not all transactions are made right after a block, and even more technically, it's a bit more because not all pending valid trnsactions make it into the first block), but the actual time between blocks is random. Nodes have very little to do with influencing times, but miners certainly do. If the amount of mining power on the network tripled tomorrow, the average block time would go to a third of currently, until the next difficulty retarget.

I tend to think of probability in Bayesian terms. I asked you to define your terms first, and you seemed to accept the Bayesian definition.


If someone would claim there is no God, would you assign them the burden of proof as well? Or are you making a subtle distinction between positive/negative claims, and do you feel that can be consistent?


It's a bit more complicated than that, but now I'm starting to get bored with the discussion.


We were assuming that someone had reason to raise their probability of belief to 10%. You had an argument that basically said "I accept that someone could be reserving judgement, but can't accept certainty; but religion requires 100% belief, ergo I can't accept religion". My point is that *if* someone had a low level of belief, they have a motive to "trick" themself into adopting a higher level. Definition of rational is "maximising expected utility" in this case.

I already did. I'd like your argument that the Bible's existence is more likely in a Judeo-Christian-god-less world than one with that God.




So why isn't that analogous to someone who trusts their priest, who says they've got lots of evidence, and can even produce multiple books arguing at long length for the existence of God?
Imagine you were in an alternate world in which there *was* a massive conspiracy by doctors/ medical researchers/ big pharma to push unsafe/ineffective vaccines. How would you recognize you were in that world? From what you've said, you wouldn't have any way of knowing, because these statistics would still be published (they'd be made up), your doctor would tell you the same thing (they'd believe the published statistics), etc.


You don't have any idea what I'm talking about, again. I'm referring to things like  which talks about precognition, which has nothing to do with "after we die", and can definitely be tested.


You said that someone else that believes something they can't personally prove is necessarily basing themself on assumptions, and I said that everyone needs to use assumptions, and there's nothing wrong with that.


Otherwise, you have to accept that a belief in God cannot rest on logical thought. There comes a time in the process by which you determine your beliefs that you have to say "I accept this knowing there is no way to prove its validity".
Let's rephrase that in terms of one of your beliefs.


Otherwise, you have to accept that a belief in the safety of  vaccines cannot rest on logical thought. There comes a time in the process by which you determine your beliefs that you have to say "I accept this knowing there is no way to prove its validity".
Now when the same argument is presented against something you actually believe, I'm sure you'll have no problem finding the flaws (in particular, the major flaw that's contained in the implied "not having conclusive evidence means that there's no evidence".)


Not sure how that helps the discussion or shows anything. You're deciding not to accept my arguments, that doesn't impact on how silly I might or might not be.

That's not necessarily true (there are those who claim to have received "visions" and the like), but even if true, it wouldn't mean it can't be addressed by logic. There are plenty of things you can't observe and still believe exist. (An example that comes to mind is of historical figures.)

You immediately run into the problem that atheists are the minority. Not just now, but arguably over the last few millennium as well.


Why isn't this susceptible to a reversal? If you claim there is no test that can prove God, then there must also be no test that can disprove it either. You would need to assume both sides are false, in that case, or your system is more complex than you are claiming.
(About what you're saying about doubt: imagine you had a 10% credence in the claim that God exists. In that 10%, you'd be much better off completely believing it if possible, for reasons you mentioned above. [I think it's more complex than that, but I'll go along for now]. So it would be rational (ala Pascal's Wager, just with better numbers) to convince yourself that you actually did believe in it completely. It's not clear why that isn't "logical".)

I'd like you to define your terms before we get into that. What do you mean by evidence? If you mean [this]( I could point to multiple observations that are strictly more likely in a world that contains a Judeo-Christian god. (E.g. the Bible.) If you mean something else by evidence, please define it.


You said above:


Which implied that their arguments were similar to the one you gave.


Try reserving judgement on anything you can't personally research. It won't get you very far. It's so much easier to make something up than to debunk it that the battle is one-sided.


I see you haven't looked at these kind of sites for too long. They *do* think they've conclusively proven it with studies. A quick search turns up  and   and  all claiming studies that show vaccines are harmful.


I'm going to bet that you haven't actually seen it. I may be wrong, and if so tell me, but I don't think you've read even 5 studies on vaccines. (If you have, then we can talk about a different non-mainstream view. I'm even more sure that I can find a topic on which you haven't extensively studied, which you're still willing to reject contrarian views. Whether it's alternate medicine, conspiracy theories (of which there are so many that you couldn't have researched all of them even as a full-time job), parapsychology, and so on, there's going to be *something* you're going to believe (and should rationally believe) even without disproving seemingly valid arguments against it.)
You can't be a polymath anymore, the amount of knowledge in the world is too great. You need to either reject all knowledge you didn't personally verify (almost impossible, although some philosophers have embraced that), or accept that some things are likely to be true even though you can't "prove" it using a narrow definition.

If you only voted for people who agreed with you, rather than selecting for "electability" and so on, and everyone else did the same, and you actually had good data on whether a politician was honest (i.e. voting records and so on), all these would help the situation.

A large miner that doesn't play nice can already do some attacks, right? Even at 30% they can get more than their share.
But if mining huge blocks over capacity will harm bitcoin, then we presume miners won't want to do so anyway.
But talking about actual attacks: you're implying that such a miner will deliberately mine huge blocks to increase the max blocksize. Disregarding the possible incentives, a 30% minermay not cause much of an increase at all. The formula I gave elsewhere was:


so if someone mines 30% of the blocks, they can make the average go up to 30% of the split between what others miners make and the max, and it might not cause an increase in the blocksize at all. It would depend on the actual numbers, which you might be able to get by looking at historical blocksize info?

Assuming they still want centralisation, which it looks like they do, whichever party is putting hashes into the chain is preventing double spends.
Say I want to sell a share to you. I sign a message saying so, send it to the secondary nasdaq network, they change their public ledger, and every so often they take a hash, signed by nasdaq's private key, and put it in the blockchain. That ensures the irreversibility of transactions (and if you do it every block you have the same confirmaton times as bitcoin), but doesn't take a lot of space.

Not every unknown statement is true 50% of the time. Also, it isn't quite true that there's no evidence either way, in the Bayesian sense.
 &gt;Because the lack of evidence makes it rational to reject the existence of God. To then accept it because "it's in your best interest should it be right" goes against the rational choice.
There's not a dichotomy between "reject" and "fully accept". We were talking about a hypothetical person who rationally believes in a 10% chance of God. The question was whether they should upgrade that to 100% if possible because it leads to a better expected outcome; the gain from changing in that 10% chance is over 10 times more than what's lost in the other 90%.

Since it's an average, you'd need a lot of miners to be bumping up to the max to increase it. If there are 51% of miners conspiring, they could just refuse to mine on the "small" miners chain anyways.
Perhaps the numbers could be tweaked that the blocksize could only be increased if 51% (or maybe even more) of miners agree, either by making larger blocks, or a more explicit "vote" somewhere in the blocks.

"Many of us have fallen for scams in the past" well according to some posters in this thread, you're all fools and retarded. I was trying to explain why smart people went into this, and others said that no smart person would ever do this.
Also, a lot of the 12 million have been given to zenminer and paybase users. They probably don't have too much left, having dumped most of it. That doesn't mean it wasn't a scam, of course.
And it might not be my place to say this, but the response to this has been too little and done wrong. Many of the articles calling paycoin a scam got half the details wrong (I saw one claim that there were upward of 18 million coins), the thread on bitcointalk is full of insults back and forth. There weren't good things written up in an easy to find way until very recently. That's a problem with the bitcoin community. There needs to be better analysis earlier.
A month ago, I wasn't sure about it, and I was looking at some of the criticism. Whenever I would point out a factual problem with the analysis (like someone said the blockchain was private so we didn't know what happened to the coins, or that you couldn't stake on your local wallet), I would get a lot of downvotes, which gave me the impression that the reddit crypto community didn't really care about truth. On the bct thread, there seems to have been some good research and a lot of yelling. If the people yelling could control themself better, I think many people would have been convinced it was a scam. And all those death threats against Josh? That didn't sound like warning people of a scam. People like you who care should try to prevent trolls supporting either side from interfering with the message.
(For the record, I decided it was a scam after they delayed paybase for a week.)

I've looked through source code a few times but not enough to understand anything just from that. I've seen the post about bitcoin mining by paper and pencil, which was hilarious but impractical. I can explain to a newbie how POW works, how multiple inputs lead to multiple outputs, how it's impossible to crack an address in any amount of time before heat death, how change addresses work, how to compile the code from scratch, the difference between the reference client and ones that don't download the full blockchain like Multibit, and a couple more things.

(Note: my criticism here does not imply anything about my own view on ccn and gaw. I've seen in the past that I can't simply disprove something on this sub without a disclaimer or I get downvoted.)
This article does not do a very good job of analysing the relationship.


The exact claim made by Fargo on hashtalk is that Josh did not claim to be partnered with Amazon. None of the statements in this article contradict that. It may very well be true that Josh said that, but the article only asserts that, and does not source. The sources only say that you will be able to purchase from Amazon through Paybase, not that they are partnered. (Just like you can buy on  or  from Amazon even though those sites aren't partnered with Amazon.) So this doesn't illustrate Fargo lying as the article claims.


No source for that. It appears the Google screenshots are capturing comments made on that page, and are not from the article. (I can go into more depth if someone wants me to.) Do a search on the source of that page  for "Josh mentioned" to see the original comment. Can't link to the comment directly for some reason, but it's clearly not from Fargo.


Too late. And false. (Or at least unsourced.)




I've got no idea whether this is true. What I *do* know is that the article has 0 sources for that, thus making it impossible to confirm it without doing your own research, yet stating it as fact.
I've read some of the other posts by this author, and they all follow the same pattern; lots of bold statements, little to back them up. Even if they are correct, it's not the way things should be done. And I've shown that much of this *isn't* correct.

Paybase is already functional to buy and sell, what is meant by exchange is that it will show the orderbooks instead of just a price. Kind of like bitfinex instead of coinbase.
And they own coin-base which already does the same thing (except it doesn't do fiat, and Paybase is supposed to.)

Although I *do* intend to have a lookie at sha-256 when I have a lot of free time. The best way to exploit that would be mining on a pool, sending many shares and ripping off the pool by blocking blocks, so nobody notices that the network hashrate goes up too much.
You do this to all pools equally so all statistics change in sync.
Has anyone ran a  over the bitcoin mining loop? That would be a good way to find relatively simple ways that sha-256 might be hacked.

I just looked up that article 
There's something fishy; the tweet is on Nov 24, and is *mentioned in the article!* The article itself is on Nov 25. So I'm not sure how they are confirming a statement that was never given to coinsource. Anyone want to enlighten me on what exactly happened?
Anyway, I see a few possibilities:
1. Coinfire told the truth, for some reason didn't pick up on Authy's messup. In that case Authy lied. Most probable reason for that is that they really did tell Garza that, but someone realized later that it didn't look good for Authy to give out customer info, so denied it later. Evidence for this: Authy hasn't stopped GAW from using them, which I'd expect them to do if GAW lied about Authy. Authy also hasn't put out any statement directly except that short tweet.
2. Coinfire told the truth, Authy stepped over their rules in order to defend Zenminer for some reason (I don't really see a reason for them to include that in the statement in this scenario).
3. Coinfire lied and made up the Authy statements. Authy was asked on twitter if they release customer info and said no. Authy did tell Josh, but it was not supposed to be released publicly, so authy is washing their hands of it while keeping as quiet as possible.
Some of these overlap. I think that any scenario where Coinfire told the truth about Authy and GAW lied is fishy for reasons I explained. I think  is the most likely, but that still destroys Coinfire's credibility because they didn't pick up on Authy's lie. Or they got a partial statement and made up the rest.

Can you explain why someone who asks questions is a troll only when they're not supporting you?


I've been banned from hashtalk, so it will have to wait. The last time I asked some form of that I was told something about PR recommending not to, though.
I've stated numerous times that I think GAW is scamming people, so stop trying to make me out as a defender. When someone (not you) posts false info, and I disprove it, that doesn't make me a troll or a "discreditor".
I tried to find archives of the twitter page but didn't see the pictures. If you do restore it and the date is before the published date of the documents on ftc.gov I will concede the point. I honestly don't see any proof that you have a contact at the SEC, and the "proofs" given are very insubstantial.
Claiming you're right doesn't prove it. I keep on getting told to "trust your reputation" and when I attempt to look up the things the rep was given for in the first place, it looks fishy to me. Calling me a troll for pointing that out is not helping your rep.
If you want, you can keep on posting whatever you want, and the truth will eventually come out, and you don't have to care about your rep. I'll keep on pointing out that none of what you claimed to have proven was actually proven. I could take a standard SEC form and "redact" names out of it.


GAw says the exact same thing. I'm noticing a lot of parallels between you, actually. They claim you should trust them because they have a good rep, can't say more because "lawyer", they also get death threats, they do weird pre-announcements, they also claim that if the allegations were true then someone would have sued already, etc.


I could say the exact same thing every time someone asks whether I'm telling the truth. Instead, I find sources. Your defenses here fit lying better than they fit an honest person.
At least correct the problems in the authy article that I pointed out to you weeks ago.

Trezor used to have a license which allowed anyone to use their code in their own hardware. This is not reversible legally; once released you can't take it back. They then apparently got upset that others were using their code (legally), so they decided to change to a license which doesn't let other people use it.
This would normally be fine, as it only applies to new code they produce, and they can license that how they want, but what they did was worse. They changed the source on Github to make it look like they had been using the other license for months, even for old code which was already released under the old license.

Very few people get that kind of trust from me, and no one who has holes like that in their post. He didn't say "gaw and ccn are in this together, I have proof but can't post it now", he claimed specific proof which is just wrong.

It's not so simple as every claim made against gaw is true and every defense is false.

From what I can tell there have been some coinfire articles alleging things with denials from gaw.   
I personally found the last one badly done as the supposed statements from authy contradicted each other. As long as they quote unnamed sources I don't give them too much credibility.
There is also  running at 580 pages. There seem to be some real concerns there as well as a lot of trollers repeating the same things after it was disproven, or calling people names. (At least reddit insults get voted down.)
The main thing I view as supporting the not-a-scam story is the WSJ article on them  It says he's partners with Cantor Fitzgerald, which appears true as the linked page lists GAW as partly owned by its Vice-Chairman.

That's why I said technically and put it in parens. If you had that much power and wanted the maximum mining reward, it would probably be better to hold off, but I haven't done the math. Maybe alternating no power and 10X power every retarget or something. Ideally you'd act such as to convince other miners to stop/slow down (maybe with credible threats on forcing orphans), then try to lower the difficulty as much as possible.

I'm thinking it was a mistake to put that in, as I'm getting condescended to. Should have just asked the question.
I guess it is sort of correct to say that some rigs will only turn back on with a price rise, because otherwise the difficulty goes back. How does everyone make that happen, though? If me and you both have miners, but we can't both mine or difficulty goes up and nobody profits, how do we decide which one mines? How is an equilibrium reached with not everyone mining when everyone is in the same position? (eli18)
And completely off topic: is it worth it for a miner to pay other miners not to mine by paying them what they would expect to earn, thus getting more themself? Is there any way that could work?

If I was deciding now, I wouldn't put any money into it, but I'm not discouraged enough to dump my current holdings at a loss. *If* he was telling the truth about the $100 million, then it's very hard to see how this breaks down. I've got sell orders in at the $20 price in case it surges again, and if it does that even once I'm sitting on a large profit. I think (and hope) in a few days the floor will become reality. He says right now that they're keeping it from completely dropping through paybase, which seems to fit, as it hasn't dropped to ~0 yet.
It also wouldn't require much money to bring it back to $20: I've calculated a maximum of $3-4 million worse-case. I get the feeling that he doesn't want to take that plunge, but a few more days of this and he will be forced to.

There are no entities with jurisdiction to pass laws on the entire planet. International law is a large collection of treaties that only binds countries that agree to them. That's why a much bigger deal is made of Iran's nuclear program than Israel's, because Iran signed the treaty not to do that, and Israel didn't, for example.
There are some treaties agreed to by every country (like the one establishing the UN). But the ones covering extradition or money laws  haven't been agreed to by all countries.
I happen to live in the US, and am not bound by any laws in other countries I do not visit, unless the US signs a treaty with them. If Russia decided to pass a law banning anyone worldwide from owning bitcoin, I would not be obligated to obey it just because we live on the same planet.

There are people who mined hashpoints from the beginning, which gave a profit anywhere above $4 (maybe even lower.) Many of the hashlets had roi for early buyers already.

I'm not quite sure *what* he's saying, but it seems clear he isn't deleting any mention of the $20 floor. He responded to my questions a few times.
My personal view is that he's waiting to bring out his fund until it falls more, and then it will be brought up slowly, and once people notice the price will jump. He did put a lot of money into the floor at first (someone was in middle of doing an analysis of that, I think). It shouldn't take too much to move it to $20 (I looked at the open orders and calculated $1 million, and max $3 given generous assumptions of how many coins would be dumped right away.) If it's not up to $20 in a month I'll change my mind.
Also, he said on twitter that he's going to accept credit cards today; if he was planning on exiting soon, he would be worried about chargebacks. That's assuming he actually opens that up and doesn't delay it.
He seems to be using it even now, or it would fall below the 7-8 levels that it's holding at.
Edit: as this is being used as proof that I am "pro-gaw", I'd like to say that I no longer agree with what was said here; the last few days have changed my mind, particularly the fact that Josh's old posts were deleted, and the statement on hashtalk that there are no plans to bring back the floor.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:36:48


surely that's a little too much? There *was* ~$500,000 on cryptsy going in which got absorbed, and there was presumably more on paybase (a lot of people posted about how they got $20 on paybase in the first half-hour).
The WSJ also vetted some of the claims.


Of course I'm skeptical. The main reason I think it will rise soon is because at some point it would be trivial to raise it with very little money, and it makes sense for Gaw to wait to buy until the price drops more. I don't think Gaw can get away with stopping completely, as there's too much evidence against him by now. If it turned out that there wasn't even $5 million in the fund, then I expect he'd go to jail for a long time. If there was even a few million it could be brought back up to $20 easily.
That said, I've spoken to a lawyer about this, and I'm trying to cover myself both ways.

I know how bitcoin works. I know why there's time between blocks. The problem here is not that I'm waiting for a block, but that the unconfirmed transaction doesn't show up on blockchain.info, because they didn't see a certain transaction. That means that not everyone on the network has access to all transactions, which is worrisome.
There's also the problem that a couple of blocks have been found since and my transaction still isn't included.

So I was trying to speak from a legal point of view, not a practical one. Obviously no country actually cares about legalities, (*citation needed*). The only binding international body would be the [UN Security Council]( so China, France, Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States, would all have to agree on something to get it done. (And then they would commit to using force.)
If the US does something by itself (like invade another country), then as long as China and Russia aren't annoyed enough to go to war over it, they'll get away with it. I don't think it's accurate to say that the US owns the planet. 


That's just capitalist propaganda! /s 
Obviously the US is the best place to end up except for other countries with more rational leaders.


Countries that have rule of law can be "forced" to abide by their treaties. E.g. if the US broke one of its treaties then you could sue to force them to follow it. But that could take years.
I've heard it said that the international system is really anarchist, which seems fairly accurate, except that there's a pretense of international law which gets enforced by the big countries how they want it. They can't have *too* blatant violations of the law, though.

Produce them. The fact is that there's nothing in the letters that couldn't have been made up by someone using only public information.


calling anyone who questions you a troll is *exactly* the kind of thing that GAW is known for doing. (So is the hiding behind "legal advice".) Since you seem to know how much I've invested somehow (perhaps you saw my information in the SEC complaints? If you did, you can easily prove it to me privately by PMing me the email address I gave to the SEC, or a hash of it to preserve privacy in case there are multiple "ike"-related names involved in this.)
I'm not trying to discredit you, per se. I'm pointing out that what other people are citing as proof isn't actually proof. The SEC letters have standard text that could have been taken from other companies, or could even have been real, without proving you have a contact at the SEC. You didn't claim to get the letter straight from the SEC, so even if it was real it could have been straight from the company in question.


This is actually pretty funny. Let's make a deal: I'll put up a "story" libeling Coinfire on my blog, and we'll see whether it can be taken down. It's very hard to take things off the web. That argument actually works in reverse to say that Paybase must be legit, because it hasn't been taken down yet. No. Paybase is fraudulent, and the fact that it is still up does not disprove that.
Some final words: my personal opinion is that most likely (credence of 75%) most of what you publish is more-or-less true, and that you wouldn't publish something false deliberately. Credence of around 25% that you're deliberately lying. But I do think you have some articles that weren't researched enough, and mistakes crept in inadvertently. For example, the authy statements in [this article]( I think you should insert a statement there noting that the two authy statements contradict each other. I've noted that in the past, and you sort of brushed it off. If you showed a bigger effort to be accurate, I'd have more confidence.
I've been trying to look up the BFL story, and it appears Mike's Twitter account has been deleted, and the "first" claims are based on posts which I don't see. As of now I don't see evidence that the story was published before the documents were public, just you saying so. The BFL files appear to be at  added on September 15 more than a week before your article ran. I can't actually tell whether the added date is accurate (Google can put the wrong date on sometimes), but it doesn't seem to prove anything to me especially when Mike's twitter is deleted.
None of my complaints against you are untrue. If you are telling the truth, you could defend yourself a lot better than you're doing now. All the stories that people have advanced to prove your trustworthiness didn't hold up on further research. If you could show at least one article that had news before it was public (and didn't have mysterious deletions after, or draw on public information, or anything) I'd be much more confident in your reporting.
I think you're overhyping your past "success" to get people to believe you now, but you simply haven't earned that credibility yet. Again, I'm not "trying to discredit you", I'm not a troll (or I would use a throwaway). 
You tried to discredit me by alleging that I'm trying to defend gaw. That is incorrect. I've stated numerous times that I now believe GAW to be a scam. Perhaps you are unaware that I am the one responsible for the large [archive of hashtalk]( Why would I do that if I was trying to protect them?

You only need their money to cover the fees and spread. Just figure out what percentage you're losing each day so you can know how much to spend for a given amount of donations.
I'm talking like buying 100 btc and then selling them 30 seconds later, without trying to time it at all. Although if you really start doing it, real traders might manipulate you and you'll start losing more, so it should be at random times during the day, or perhaps put in simultaneous buys and sells a two exchanges. You want the most volume for the smallest loss.
Also make sure to post daily screenshots of your transactions so people can see where their money is going, and perhaps have a live volume/donations counter somewhere on your website.

For something that "everyone knows" a lot of money has been put into these things.

The 50% that's held by prime controllers "belongs" to the people with hashstakers. It's not like it's completely owned by gaw. But I see your point.
I don't believe in paycoin anymore. I could find you an explanation from a month ago if you want.
I actually got all my money back, so no skin in it for me anymore. I'm NOT trying to defend gaw here. What I am saying is that the people who were spreading lies about gaw indirectly helped the scam grow, by discrediting the people who were giving real arguments. (I'll look up the posts later.)

So the correct thing to do is not to decide whether to support him until we know.
You know, there's a reason there are things called trials instead of voting on reddit, perhaps because the former is more likely to produce a correct verdict.
Go ahead. Make the argument that the jury system produces *more* false convictions than having reddit users vote on each case would, after tiny amounts of research in most cases.

So someone can make guaranteed money (well this is guaranteed no loss, but change the numbers slightly to guarantee a win) by betting 1btc against me, then shorting 2btc: (assuming price now at $200, and the coin bet is just bought)
Price goes up to $500: makes 1 btc from bet, now has 2btc which pays off the short, total profit is $400 from short - $200 for the 1 btc they buy now
Price goes down to $100: loses the btc to me, pays back the short at $200, it's a wash as $400 from short=$200 to pay it off+$200 to buy the coin bet.
I'm retracting the bet, but I'm giving both of you gold as consolation.

Is that a legal opinion? Why would hacking a site that's clearly criminal be illegal? The US Government [claims](


identify its IP address, such an investigative measure would not have run afoul of the Fourth
Amendment. Because the SR Server was located outside the United States, the Fourth
Amendment would not have required a warrant to search the server, whether for its IP address or
otherwise. See United States v. Vilar, 729 F.3d 62, 86 (2d Cir. 2013) (Fourth Amendment
warrant requirement does not apply extraterritorially); In re Terrorist Bombings of U.S.
Embassies in East Africa, 552 F.3d 157, 167 (2d Cir. 2008) (same). At most, any search of the
SR Server needed only to be “reasonable” – that is, justified by “legitimate governmental
interests.” Vilar, 729 F.3d at 86. Given that the SR Server was hosting a blatantly criminal
website, it would have been reasonable for the FBI to “hack” into it in order to search it, as any
such “hack” would simply have constituted a search of foreign property known to contain
criminal evidence, for which a warrant was not necessary .
That seems like a reasonable argument to me.

Ah. I had misunderstood exactly how the signing worked. So it is impossible to tell whether the program is using that deterministic procedure for k unless you have the private key. I'd thought it *was* possible, and therefore bitcoin could force all clients to use it by only letting in txes that used it.
Are there any other public private key systems that don't require random numbers for every signing? The fact that bitcoin does seems like a significant weakness.

Well they lied about authy and you don't seem to have stopped reading them or stopped giving them credibility. I'm sure people will still read them even if they turn out to be wrong about Gaw.
Do you really not think that coinfire is getting a lot of traffic over this and making money?
Your argument applies to every tabloid sensational journalism out there, and most of those are false. People still read them.
I've thought a lot about this. Spent a lot of time. I see people posting that they spend 20 minutes reading about this and already came to a conclusion, and once they choose a side, it's impossible to get them to even admit that people on their side are lying.
The fact is that most of my posts about this are downvoted *even ones that stick only to fact*, which makes me think that people just don't care about truth. If everyone really cared what was true, then they wouldn't blindly downvotes anything that pattern-matches to not-anti-gaw.

I think there's probably some big money behind it for various reasons including the WSJ article which mentioned Cantor Fitzgerald and the claimed $100 million dollars backing. At least they've got a lot of money from hashlet sales in pocket.
I find it very hard to believe that it's a complete scam, as whoever's involved has to expect to go to jail at this point. Why haven't they ran already? Much of the claims against them seem extremely flimsy, and we know people are making things up (hashie.co ownership, false sec litigation photoshop). I've read through a couple hundred pages of the thread on bct, and it's a lot of posts of people calling anyone who disagrees a shill or idiot. There are a very few sane posts made there, but they seem to tolerate the more ridiculous stuff, but not people trying to defend gaw in any way. (Much like this thread. If you look through all my posts here which were downvoted, there was some that only made claims of pure fact, which were clearly only downvoted because it was perceived as pro-gaw, not because of any flaw with it.) 
I don't have much of a comment on the actual features of it and I couldn't care less about the critics who point to its centralization: that's a technical problem with it, not something which makes it a scam. The things to worry about scamwise are mainly the fact that the floor hasn't been reached yet. I'm starting to think that gaw is planning on waiting until the price drops more and then buy up all the cheap coins quickly before the market can react. That does seem the best way to enforce a floor if you're optimizing for least money spent.
I do sympathize with the feeling that whatever they do someone will complain. That said, they don't seem super competent, and I don't put much faith in Paycoin taking off in a big way, but I do think anyone who hangs in there will have an exit with some profit.
If by February it hasn't reached $20 yet, then we can agree to call it a scam. If it has, can we agree not to call it a scam?

So first of all, only miners and nodes connected at the time of broadcast can tell, so you've gotten rid of objectivity. Second, you could get a node to accept a shorter chain, even while knowing the longer one, if you can control their connections, thus breaking the chain, even after you stop blocking. (You can do this now if you Sybill a node, but after you stop, they'll get the new blocks from other people. With this, you make the distrust persistent.)
Third, why wouldn't a miner just publish all blocks right away? Generally, we assume they want to keep the attack secret from the public, but they *could* broadcast immediately, which wouldn't set off your flags. (That at least is fixable by looking at how many "deliberate orphans" the chain created recently, but that also seems gameable for Dos and other purposes.)

I haven't seen any statements from Amazon. What we have is a claim from Coinfire that Amazon gave them a statement, versus a claim from Gaw that they're working with Amazon. I don't see why either side should be trusted over the other.
The Coinfire quote is from an unidentified Amazon spokesperson.
Coinfire has been known to mess up in their reporting on Gaw; e. see  where they quote Authy and contradict themself in the article. They say that Authy doesn't comment on customers usage, and then *carry an alleged quote from Authy commenting on customers usage!* 
That's when coinfire lost credibility for me. They also said Amazon would be suing, has anyone seen that lawsuit yet? Otherwise how do you know coinfire isn't just making all those statements up?

And they called me a troll and taunted me for pointing out that some of their stories don't have confirmation. [Link](
As I've said before, Coinfire and GAW use a lot of similar tactics:
1. Around for less than a year
2. Hiding behind "secret agreements/documents" then saying that a lawyer said not to reveal more
3. Calling people who question them a troll, then says they won't interact with trolls anymore and they don't have to defend themself against them
4. Saying that we should trust them because they've been trustworthy in the past, and "time will tell"
5. Posting "pre" announcements
6. Deleted posts/twitter account
7. Promises to provide documents in some cases (i.e. Wired) then backs out
8. Gets death threats (I know this isn't their fault unless some kind of really weird false flag is going on, but still)
Despite the fact that I think most of what they post is basically true and in good faith, there's some problems with how they work.
And consider that if they *are* telling the truth about the SEC, then someone is breaking the law (they might be protected by free speech precedents as journalists, but they appear to be actively asking someone in the SEC to break the law for them. If it turns out that they asked for those documents, they may lose that protection. Not a lawyer though, this could be wrong.)

It sounds like you don't know what some of the words mean. Cash is fungible, and a simple search can tell you that. If you think it isn't you're using a different definition of the word. So to answer that question you need to tell me what you mean by fungible, preferably with examples.

When you're trying to convince people, you need to do more than that. I don't think people should be calling scam without linking at least to some evidence.
I merely asked what their evidence was, did not try to defend it, did not claim it wasn't a scam, just wanted to know why they called it scam. What's wrong with that? For some reason this has gotten more downvotes than the posts where I *did* try defend some of the aspects of it.
@_date: 2015-01-18 15:08:11
Can you show me your post dated over a month ago that gave enough info to reasonably conclude it was a scam? Did you predict everything that would happen until now, and how much did you get right? Have you ever thought something was a scam and been wrong? It's easy to say after the fact, but very few were talking until recently (after paycoin launched.) Many of the complaints weren't too detailed either. I'd also say that the tone of the people making the accusations may have damaged their credibility. There were a lot of smart people caught up in this, and to dismiss them as fools is wrong.
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:50:20

Redacted letters can be made by anyone. Even if those are real, they don't imply a government source; Coinfire could have gotten them from the companies who they were sent to.

That argument is misleading; there's absolutely nothing wrong with the particular collection of bits that makes up some paycoin that I may own or want to buy. There *is* something wrong with the collection of bits that contain fraudulent marketing, CP, or other illegal/immoral things.


If they want to know whether they should buy a new altcoin that's listed on such an exchange, then they don't have to rely on the fact that it's listed to decide. But if someone wants to buy LTC, for example, why would an exchange that listed paycoin be worse? I'd prefer an exchange that listed more coins over one that listed less, because it gives me strictly more options.

And when you say Josh is "known" ... "known" by whom? Is this your personal opinion (as evidence by your totally objective username) or has he been arrested in the past for scamming?
If the argument for this being a scam is "obviously" it's a scam because josh is a scammer, that's known as a circular argument.


I care about the truth, and I'm pointing out things that aren't true.
When someone makes a false accusation against them (like that he owned hashie.co, or the photoshopped sec investigation), and I point it out, if people cared, they would agree instead of just downvoting. If you have to jump on false accusations to attack something, there's a problem.
Do you think it is ethically good to lie about a company you believe is a scam, and ethically bad to point out lies if it can be seen as defending something viewed as bad? That's what you seem to be advocating, and you need to defend your claim, as many people would disagree with that.
None of the facts I've stated are false. If you think they are, say which one. So people are downvoting based on what side they think I'm on instead of substance. They're using the downvote as a disagree button against reddit rules.

That's an interesting point. You're saying it may reduce practical fungibility even if not technically.
 Upon further thought, that wouldn't be fungibility as much as risk. If I have X in cash, I would still be willing to exchange it for you X in cash. It's only exchanging other things for cash and vice versa that might be discouraged.
So it wouldn't be affecting fungibility even practically, although I'm a bit less certain of this than before.

Buyback for $4 when $20 was promised is bullshit. There were a *lot* of posts on hashtalk encouraging people to buy at any price under $20, and Josh did nothing to stop that, so to make sure no one loses, he needs to payback any losses.
If we're still going with the "dumper" narrative, how about offer to buy back for purchase price (under $20) if that can be proven? Make anyone who wants to sell upload screenshots of how much they bought it for, and give them that plus 10% to cover fees.
That would ensure that no-one has a loss from buying paycoin, but people aren't breaking gaw's bank by "dumping".
For that matter, you've claimed that $100 million is in a fund; you've later said that only 1/3 of that is used for stability. Surely you realize that the coin's price can be pushed to $20 with a small fraction of that amount of buying power?

Every guide to accepting payments says (or should say) not to accept zero confs. There are merchant processing companies that will accept them, and those will properly check for bad transactions.
Besides, there's a chance of double-spending even without this opt-in RBF, as Todd proved several times. Anyone trying against a merchant who didn't care about risk would succeed an extremely high portion of the time (there are other techniques, like sending transactions mined by some pools but not others, e.g. ones that blacklist some output addresses).

That doesn't make sense, sorry. To search for a hash having property x will take longer than searching for a hash that just needs to be valid.
I may have misunderstood you, but it doesn't seem like you could hedge against your own back luck, because you can easily exploit that by claiming to be able to mine much more than you have. You need something like shares in a pool.

It's missing the class of arguments that 20mb isn't the right limit, because the limit should increase gradually/as needed, rather than being hard, and this just puts off the next hard fork. If we're going to fork, we should do it right.
(I haven't really followed all the arguments on this, but why can't the limit at any time be maximum(largest block to date, average of last N blocks*(1+X)) for some small value of X? That should ensure that the limit increases only when it's needed. You could look through how this would have worked historically on the blockchain to get plausible values for X and N.)

If you're doing something risky like accepting zero confs (even under current conditions you can be scammed some of the time), you better pay attention, and should know not to run old wallets on zero confs that don't check for the flag. I have little sympathy for someone who's business model depends on risk, but can't even program their system to check for the flag.


Full rbf could still work with zero conf as long as it's opt out, and any transactions needed to clear quickly would opt out or not be accepted. I don't think it's a good idea, though.
But the op is complaining about what's been merged, I.e. opt in. You should make clear that you're mainly talking about something that isn't being merged.

It still wouldn't work. Every solo miner now has an almost 0% chance of finding even a single block ever. The way pools work is that (to use simple numbers) 10,000 people each with a .01% chance of getting a block work together, they produce one block, and each of them gets .01% of the payout. There's a thing called "shares" which basically proves you did *some* work, which shows what probability you had of finding a block.
There's no reason someone would bet that you would find a block in the way you're talking about, because you could just lie about your potential.
Maybe ask in the  thread and someone can give you a better explanation of why it wouldn't work.

In the sense that was mentioned, it's completely true. It's not possible for me to send money to you without involving any other parties; if I send you a transaction privately, the bitcoin network will never know about it until someone transmits it to them.

Sort of; there are plenty of [bugs that have been fixed]( including [one]( that allowed the creation of 184 billion coins.
So it can be infected in the sense that if there's a bug, it might be exploitable, and during that time people might succeed in making money. However, if that happened, everyone can do an emergency upgrade to fixed code, and those coins are then invalidated; so unless they've already been spent, no harm done.


Bitcoin is inherently a consensus system. You can run different code on your computer, it will just not reach the same consensus as the network. In order to upgrade to a larger blocksize, all it takes is a bunch of miners agreeing on that. Of course, only users that upgrade will be able to use the new chain (with the exception of SPV nodes, and that only if there are full nodes that upgrade).
I realize that last sentence may sound like nonsense now, but it all makes sense eventually.

The nonce is not the only thing the miners can vary. They can also vary the timestamp and order of transactions. So the fact that the nonce was "only" 2,681,667,090 doesn't mean that miner only checked 2,681,667,090 nonces.

I already explained above exactly why that doesn't make a difference to the test. Let me try again.
You, a bitcoiner, visit the page X times. Assume the testing was 50/50 (doesn't have to be, but wouldn't make much of a difference anyways). So, X/2 times you get the regular page, and X/2 times you get the bitcoin page. You donate 0 times. You make the average for *both* pages go down by the *exact same amount*. If there are many different bitcoiners who all do this a total of Y times, the calculation is exactly the same.
Or in the words of [Meni Rosenfeld](


Mozilla didn’t compare a period in the past in which there is no button, with the current period with a button.
Rather, during a specific period of time, Mozilla randomly chosen for every visitor whether to display a button or not. Then they measured the amount donated. Their results indicated a negative correlation between “there is a Bitcoin button” and the amount donated.
Correlation between A and B can only be explained by:


2. B causes A
3. There is a common cause for A and B
4. An artifact of small sample size.

The notary can never edit or delete an entry.
It can however add entries that refer to previous entries.
So mistakes can be corrected, though the mistake and its correction will forever be visible. Including the when and where.
No, no, and no. Many forks have happened, entries get removed (orphaned) all the time. There's no political immunity, it's been banned in some countries. It certainly can be censored; anything that 50% of miners agree to censor. For example, transactions that are nonstandard are unlikely to get mined, and let's not even talk about all the soft forks that unilaterally decided to censor certain transactions.

Well, if you aren't releasing the source code until the end of the summer, any ideas may not be worth thinking of until then.
That said, the first thing that comes to mind is that a node could have constant "check-ins", and if it fails one, it's automatically removed and its money refunded.

The argument is on a legal basis (and not even the main point of the ruling); if one can't transfer it without other's permission, they don't own it exclusively.


That's an invalid comparison. Spacetime isn't human, miners are; they decide the policies they mine on (or choose defaults).


Yet unless you have 51% of the hashpower, you can't guarantee that your block will stay. And even this is besides the point; what it *means* to "own" a bitcoin is inherently tied up with the network state (the blockchain).

Not necessarily. First of all, we don't know that Amazon will accept Paypal. Second, accepting Paypal doesn't mean that you accept bitcoin, or at least that isn't known. It appears to be opt-in.


I don't see what the difference between accepting bitcoin and accepting and immediately selling is. That is, in theory you can't know what a business does with the coins they get. If they said they kept them, you'd have no way to prove they sold them.

Facebook's onion address has a cert. You can do both, and have strictly more security.
Plus, that's only something you need to do *once*. Onc you know that facebookcorewwwi.onion is facebook, you never need to trust anyone else again, while otherwise, on every connection, any CA can mitm you. (Certificate pinning helps, but then you need to use the same browser every visit.)
About getting the right site, you can check multiple directories (over ssl) and compare, which would make it harder for a CA to mitm all of them. And again, you only need to do this once, while an ssl mitm can be done on every connection.

 A private key is 256 bits while an address is 160 bits. Therefore each address will have around 2^(256-160=96) private keys. Good luck finding any.
(Public keys are 520 bits, but can be compressed to 264 apparently. So at most one private key per public key.)

OP is misleading. Ripple works with "gateways". As I understand it, anyone can become a gateway. Only a gateway can freeze funds, and you need to specifically choose to use which gateways you trust. So a gateway could freeze your funds in the same way as Coinbase can. The difference is that anyone can see if a gateway freezes funds, arguably making it superior to a centralized exchange that can freeze funds without anyone else knowing (or even if someone makes a claim, they can't prove it.)
Edit: after reading more of the page, a gateway is able to permanently opt out of freezing individual accounts. Also, the page explicitly says that XRP, the currency created out of thin air, cannot be frozen. Good job OP.

Okay, then you're talking about certificate pinning, which I agree is similar to my point about onions. The thing is, it requires you to always use the same browser, and if you clear your history, it doesn't work anymore.


The thing is, you can just keep a file with all the sites you visit, and copy-paste them whenever you want to visit them. Browser independent. You can even do this on a new browser e.g. tails, as long as you have that file.
There's no similar easy way to "carry" around the public key for SSL. You need to check the key, and manually compare every character.

Someone would need to do that to every single entity that holds a piece of the key. In fact, you could easily make it that even *with* all the pieces, it still takes a ton of work, so only the government would be able to break it even after they have the master key.

Someone with that much resources (can compromise multiple government agencies who are keeping the data airgapped and under heavy guard) has enough resources to just infiltrate the companies themself and insert backdoors.

Making the unspent amount explicit would require a hard fork *and* every single client would need to update as well (unlike the blocksize thing which doesn't affect tx formats).

Right now, you need to download the whole 30GB before you can prune. Can people upload the 1.3GB files to import into Core?

That's simply false as a matter of fact. Is multisig a vulnerability? This would be analogous, in that only someone with the master key could exploit it.

That was addressed as well. He needs to claim that the server was his in order to claim rights in it, which he still hasn't done. Iirc it was possible to make that claim without it being able to be used against him in court as an admission, but he still hasn't done so.

Multisig still has counterparty risk of people teaming up. And you can have similar to multisig in a bank: arguably the fact that deposits are FDIC insured does the same thing that multisig does.

How did you generate it?
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:25:08
No. First of all, those can be updated. But even if you don't update, as I understand it, they just sign transactions, while most of the work is done on a computer. So you'd need to update the wallet on your computer (and even then, only if you're using Bitcoin Core. If you're using a light client, then it will just communicate with the updated Bitcoin Cores on the network). It also depends on the exact change. In particular, if all transactions that you're likely to make are still valid, then you wouldn't need to update.
@_date: 2015-04-22 02:52:39
If you've read my comments, you'll see how I said that I don't support the proposal.
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:09:43
Many of the altcoins that have interesting new features are different designs that would be difficult to incorporate into bitcoin without ruining backwards compatibility. 
If you wanted to change, then every single user would need to change. That's called a [hard fork]( If (say) 80% of users upgraded, then only those 80% could use it, and the rest would be stuck on the old software. We don't want to do that unless absolutely necessary.
[Here is a list of things that might be added in a future hard fork](
A [softfork]( *does* only require 51% to switch, but can only add features that make some blocks invalid.
If you point to a specific innovation that you have in mind, I can explain why it might be difficult to incorporate into bitcoin.

Basically, what happened was that Ebay filed documents with the SEC explaining in detail how the split will work. They describe every single part of the business, apparently, so they mentioned that Braintree offers bitcoin payments.

@_date: 2015-04-22 00:22:01
You're missing the point. What they are asking for is a master key that would only allow the government to decrypt, not anyone else. (Some proposals have said the key should be split among several agencies and only used by court order.)
I don't agree, but the position is not as weak as you make it sound. There's a difference between "weaken your security for all attackers" and "weaken your security for us". The government understandably doesn't see much wrong with giving that right to the government.
Edit: someone asked a question, and I answered it. Where do the downvotes come in?

I think it's reasonable to exclude tethering from unlimited data. (Whereas it is not reasonable to exclude it from limited.) If you don't do that, eventually they'll need to stop offering unlimited plans altogether. You can't honestly tell me that users will be better off if the plan is dropped because people use it for tethering too much.
Is there a principled way to exclude tethering? Likely not. But it's a reasonably natural boundary to split "super-heavy-users" from "normal users", and as long as it's spelled out in advance and in the terms, I'm fine with it. The alternative is them having no way to control usage and dropping the plan.
(And note, they don't drop data connections after 7gb of tethering, just throttle them.)

You think another company should do something different. I'm merely pointing out that it's a free market, and if your way was better, you or someone else can prove it.

I did not say they were the same thing, I said they were analogous.
The point is, giving someone else control does not mean that anyone has control.
The analogous case by bitcoin would be to have every address be a 1-2 multisig, with the government holding half of each wallet. So just because the government can then spend any coins does not mean everyone can. Same thing with a master key.

The problem is people breaking their terms by paying for unlimited smartphone data, but using data for tethering, which isn't unlimited. Did you even read OP?

Is there demand in the US? It sounds like very few people are doing this; so few that they're willing to cut them off and not have them as customers anymore (which implies that they cost more than they pay).
Maybe if a couple of people started using their data in Finland almost to the limit (like using it 24/7) they would decide the same?

I did not say that was something I supported, and in fact if you would actually read what I said above, I don't support the "master key" proposals either. I'm just trying to point out that the counter-arguments given here are rather weak.
And you wouldn't need to trust "legions of people". If a key is split amongst several government agencies, each legally required to get a court order before accessing it, then every single one of them would need to break the law to put together the key. Assuming multiple guards per facility, that could easily come to 50 people who would need to all collude.
(For the record, there are many people at many companies who can steal your money at any time. Probably tens of thousands who have your credit card info, your bank info, etc, who could move money to their account with a couple clicks.)

Except it's explicitly forbidden in the terms. It is not reasonable to expect to be able to break the terms.


That is not what is being cracked down on. The plan is unlimited, and it doesn't allow tethering. Separately, you're allowed 7gb of tethering.




You haven't shown me any reason to think that disallowing tethering on an unlimited plan is illegal. The closest thing I can find is one where [Verizon was told to stop charging for tethering] ( but this is
1. Only for a specific spectrum that they bought with an agreement to use open access and
2. Doesn't apply to unlimited plans
Carriers offering other spectrums have even less of a problem charging.
So when the FCC explicitly says that it's fine, maybe you need a stronger argument that it isn't. See 


If you can charge for using tethering, you can limit it also (at worst, just charge a huge amount for tethering, which would be legal).

1. People complain about every company offering a centralized wallet. The problem with that is that they can refuse you access to the money at any time. So if you withdraw all coins as soon as you buy them, this isn't a big concern.
2. Coinbase has limited peoples' accounts before for "suspicious" activity. The really controversial part is that they track where you send your coins and where coins you sell come from, and if they don't like the source (e.g. gambling) they can drop you. They will also sometimes just ask you for the source, and if you don't tell them they may limit you.

This is silly. The ads and plan offerings make clear exactly what's unlimited. There's no reasonable presumption that you can use unlimited tethering also; as I've said, plenty of carriers disallow tethering altogether.


I'm perfectly within my rights to open a post office that does that (well, there are certain legislated rules about not competing with the post office, but ignore that for now). If you want an ISP that doesn't look at your data, order from one that says it doesn't; they are then legally obligated not to.

You said that multisig means that an exchange has the ability to prevent themself from freezing your account. The fact that freezing can be opted out of in Ripple means that the same is true there.
The title implied that *Ripple* can freeze your account, which isn't true. A gateway can freeze your account, but only if you choose to trust them. You can choose to only trust gateways that have opted out, and not have that risk.
(I'm glossing over the global freeze section, because that's only if a gateway is completely gone, and that could happen even without a freeze. If you feel that's a concern, then it's a problem with Ripple's trust model, not with the freeze option.)

That isn't the impression I got from reading arguments for adopting RBF. See e.g.  :


attached to transactions after they have been broadcast. Lots of users
are getting their transactions stuck with few options to fix them.


zero-conf madness in the bud: change the relay rules so that
transactions are replaced based on fees regardless of how that changes
transaction outputs. Of course, this does make double-spending an
unconfirmed transaction trivial. On the other hand, this makes changing
fees after the fact trivial, and it lets us implement a limited 'undo'
button for when people screw up.
In other words, they want random users who didn't set a high enough fee to be able to resend, and allow undoing transactions.
It doesn't seem to me to be specifically for merchants based on this and other stuff I've read. Scorched Earth is a solution to a problem RBF would bring about, but that isn't the main point of RBF.


This wouldn't be a fork, as it just sets bitcoin core miner policy. You only need one bit for this flag, and there's place enough to put it.


First of all, I do think child-pays-for-parent should be implemented by miners (I'm actually not sure why it isn't already, I can't think of any obvious reasons not to use it.)
But there are times you'd want to use RBF and not CPFP. When only the sender cares about speed, or for undoing a transaction. The point of RBf is that only the sender needs to do something.
Let's say I send coins to an exchange and they only accept them after 1 confirm. They couldn't care less how long it takes to confirm, so I'm the only person who'd want to pay a fee to get it into a block.

Transaction volume is meaningless. Anyone can send thousands of transactions for a couple dollars, it's easy to set a new record. It's just too easily manipulated.

Just throwing this out here, but why can't we implement RBF, but allow a flag in transactions that would disallow RBF for that transaction? Then anyone accepting 0-confs would require the sender to put that flag in, while you could still replace your regular transactions.
Wouldn't this satisfy everyone (a dream, I know :)?
To address one of your points:


You could require the buyer to send extra bitcoin, then send some of it back. If they double-spend, you send it all to fees and cause the buyer to lose more than if they'd simply bought the item legitimately. The article says that they could collude with miners, but luke-jr makes a good point in this thread that then it doesn't matter what's in Core. There *is* a slight logic hole in the article on this point.

So your specific claim is only that darknet regulation won't work, not all regulation. That's a more defensible position.
The obvious counter-argument is to say that the darknet should itself be regulated out of existence; if the world really wanted to, they could do this. All you'd have to do is make running a proxy illegal, then shut down all Tor nodes. This hasn't happened yet, presumably because the ones in charge think they can gain more from having Tor around than not (remember the US government originally funded the development of Tor).
But once you're agreeing that some regulation can be good, that's not a defense of the free market above all else, which was what was being criticized above.

No. Hashes per second only matter as a relative number.
Imagine the current hashes/s is a billion. (It's a lot greater, but bear with me.) Now let's say that a billion hashes/s costs 10 million dollars to buy. That means someone can spend 10.5 million dollars and attack the network with &gt;50%.
Now next year the price of hashing drops (which always happen when new hardware comes out). So now 1 billion hashes costs 5 million. People are still spending 10 million, so network now hashes 2 billion a second. The price to attack is still 10.5 million.
Basically, what matters is how much is being spent to secure the network, not how much the hashing costs.

(sorry in advance if this isn't well organized, just trying to write out all the ideas I had)


What about my idea of keeping history in the cloud encrypted? Some freenet-like system where you can request your own transactions without it being traceable to you. For that matter, we should be able to design some kind of freenet system for this kind of query itself, if we have enough proxies for queries. 


So first of all, you can ask two different nodes, and they would have to censor in exactly the same way. But let's take your example. I chose two recent blocks at random.  and 
I see one unspent 10btc  so far. It was around 15% in, so probably there are at least a couple more. Let's check the other block:  as of now, also around 15% through. 
This may be due to the blocks being recent. I'm going to check one from 6 months ago as a check on that. 320000, at  seems a good try. Sure enough, it contains  this time as the very first transaction.
So 


It looks pretty high. So it looks like your particular example of blocking 10btc transactions wouldn't work. The questions are, how often could they block without you noticing? What percentage can be guaranteed to be included probabilistically? How much overhead is needed for this verification?
As for consequences: if the nodes had to sign responses to queries, then if you could prove they lied, they'd have a problem. What if you could somehow penalize them, say if the data they give is wrong, then they automatically lose coins from their accounts, smart contracts or something, then the user could verify that the node they spoke to has some balance in their account (hm. Not sure how they could verify that, unless the coins need to be locked up? We don't want to discourage full nodes, though, so honest ones shouldn't lose.) Another problem would be that running a full node would not be immune from hacks, because you could lose money if someone made such "promises" in your name.
Incidentally, there was a proposal somewhere to add a hash of the unspent transactions to the blocks, in which case my idea here would be much more workable obviously.
I'm wondering now if there's a way to generate "consensus" among nodes without the complete blockchain. All we really need is for me to know what the consensus of the unspent tx hash is.


So you're saying that in the next version I could use Core without the blockchain? How will it solve this privacy-without-downloading-everything problem?

There'd be no point in Scorched Earth if my flag idea was used, and anyone accepting zero-confs requires the flag to be set.


The reason I'm suggesting this is as a compromise between the two sides that everyone could accept. I understand that some people think RBF is solving a problem that doesn't exist, but that's not the main opposition. The main opposition to RBF is that it causes major problems, so if a flag would prevent these problems without introducing new ones, I don't see why there would be opposition other than "it's not needed".

This is a very fair point. It depends on whether the miners need to know about your attack, in this version you probably do need to have them know.
But my point here wasn't necessarily that the attack is plausible, but that it's analogous to the "attacks" on POS. There are reasons this won't work, but there are also similar reasons attacks on PoS coins also won't work. The same attack does apply to PoS (as mentioned in the blog post).
The point is that all these are theoretical, either because of miners having a stake in the coin succeeding or other factors. If it's so easy to hack PoS then why aren't all PoS coins dead?
 &gt;All doublespend transactions could be blacklisted alone, requiring the senders to create NEW transactions replacing both previous ones. Which means the transaction to the mixer is invalidated too, and if coinjoin was used and/or the mixer chains all transactions properly, so will the payout to you be.
I don't quite get this. If mixers chained transactions like that then they wouldn't be so secure. My understanding of mixers (having never used one, though) was that they wait for some number of confirms, then send other coins that are completely independent of the ones I sent. They can't make sure that all outgoing are chained to the coins that came in without compromising privacy.


That's an argument from assuming mixers are aware of all possible attacks and have analysed them properly. Considering the large number of hacks in the bitcoin space, I don't think we should rely on EMH-type arguments like that. Bitmixer says it waits for only 5 confirms for over 1000BTC, and 4 or less for under 1000.


You're saying that during the attack, people will notice that hashing has decreased by 50%. What if I do it gradually? Take down a couple percent, lower the rate slowly, maybe do it while the rate is increasing so it's less noticeable, etc.

So if people *freely* choose to use a centralized system, *freely* choose to trust someone, and that trust fails, that's a failure of the free market.
This may not have been a failure of a *decentralized* market, per se, but it is a failure of letting everyone make their own decentralized decisions.

You're pulling numbers out of a hat here, apparently. Far less than 50% of transactions get reversed after being transmitted to most of the network, which takes a couple of seconds. The number of transactions reversed after being in a block is probably under 1% (I haven't looked it up, but if anyone doubts this I can do some calculations.)

If RBF was implemented, but with an "opt-out" flag, would that satisfy both sides of the debate? Merchants who want to take 0-confirms would just require the sender to include that flag (and POS systems would only show the money as "there" if it includes the flag, etc) but the use case of "didn't send a large enough fee so want to resend" would still be possible.
All transactions would be mined using RBF by default *except* for the ones in which there's a double-spend problem.
Are there any major problems with this I'm not seeing?

I'm not sure I follow this example.


A middle ground, e.g. only display transactions for the last month, might make sense, and might be more reasonable... though even that still causes crazy failure modes if the user happens to run two copies of the same wallet.
So I'm making the assumption here that we're only using the private key in a single location. If that's the case, then any outgoing transactions will already be stored in history, and any incoming ones will be unspent, so only fetching a list of new unspent outputs since last sync would ensure you have everything.
The first time you connect you have no transactions to speak of, because you just created the address. So you only need to find out about new transactions sent to that address after that date, which will all be unspent because you didn't know about them yet. This takes up much less space and bandwidth than the whole blockchain.
If you want to import addresses with history, presumably you have the history already from wherever you previously used it.
If you want to use the same addresses on multiple computers, you could have a record of transactions, which get sent from one to the other. They would be linked then, but if it's encrypted interceptors still wouldn't know which addresses they represent. (And you can technically set up a freenet-like system that sends all these encrypted histories around in a plausible-deniability way, so you just pick up yours. It should still be less weight than the full blockchain.)


You can determine this probabilistically; first download the headers so you know which chain is longest. Then choose a couple of blocks randomly and download them, check all the outputs against the list received, and ask on some random subset of those not included when they were spent, then download those blocks. You could probably prove that they must have sent at least 99.9% of the data using something along these lines with only downloading a very small percentage of the blockchain.


For me the reason I don't use Core is because I don't want to use up another 30GB on my computer.

Do me a favor and shut the fuck up. This sets absolutely no precedent for someone not deliberately breaking the law by setting up a website. Notice how nobody is being sued here for operating a legitimate business.
When you set up a website explicitly to facilitate law-breaking, no it does not set a precedent that you can be prosecuted for it. People get prosecuted for breaking laws all the time, and nobody complains that it sets bad precedents.
Edit: my problem is specifically with the word "all". Not all websites are affected by this, only illegal ones.
I personally don't think drugs should be illegal, but while they are, the law should be upheld. Once we're talking about setting precedents, "ignoring any law you disagree with and hoping you get off with jury nullification" is quite a shitty precedent.

As long as people like you are using higher volume as a reason to be optimistic about bitcoin, there's a motive for people to inflate it.
But anyways, it doesn't have to be deliberate inflating to make the number meaningless. One company might be creating 5 transactions per "usage", while another might only do 2. So a shift in companies doing 2 to doing 5 could more than double transaction volume while not signalling adoption changes at all. It's just not a very good metric to focus on.

1% of miners implement RBF != 1% of transactions get canceled. That would only be the case if every single transaction attempted a double-spend.
In fact, according to the very article we're commenting on, the success rate for double-spends is already 1%, so using your logic you're already losing money.

If I were to ask "how many merchant transactions have been reversed ever", it's likely under .1%. So that's your prior for any given transactions being reversed. You'd need significant evidence pointing towards a transaction being reversed before you get anywhere near 50%.
(You may be confusing it with the probability of a double-spend succeeding after a given length of time, which is easier to calculate, given their hashing power. See e.g. 
But if an attacker has a 50% chance of double-spending, say, that doesn't mean there's a 50% chance of any transaction being reversed. If only 1 in 100,000 customers (say) had enough hash rate to attack, then the probability of any one transaction being reversed is 1 in 200,000.


The thing is, you aren't giving probabilities, you're giving made up numbers. If you want probabilities, you should give a number much closer to 0%, to reflect the real probability. There's also a cost to carrying out a fork attack, which is huge compared to any individual transactions that would be taking place through chainpay.
Look through  and all the papers linked from there to get a better understanding of the real probabilities of success and the likelihood of reversal.
If you are talking about probability of an attack succeeding  conditioning on someone trying to reverse a transaction, then you need to both make that clear, and make clear assumptions about how much the attacker is putting into it.
Oh, and one thing I didn't comments on before:


So now I'm being pedantic, but even if chainpay gives a guarantee, there's still a chance chainpay goes bankrupt and doesn't pay it. Nobody can give a 100% guarantee on anything, it just doesn't exist.

Above you said that the target market here doesn't want to learn how to use bitcoin. So presumably they aren't going to *have* a large amount of bitcoin, and so they have nothing to make a smart contract with.

There are at least 5 things that would need to hold:

2. resources are scarce
3. even if 1 holds, there needs to be a society, i.e. they don't work independently. Humans are social, but no reason to assume aliens would be.
4. No trust (if there was, no need for bitcoin or fiat, just have everyone keep track of how much resources they've used or something)
5. People have different tastes and different output levels (otherwise a simple socialism state works fine)
and so on. Any comparison between aliens and us must assume many things like these. And whn people bring in Star Trek to prove their point: sorry. Star Trek was optimised to provide entertainment to the last generation, not to be a realistic picture of how aliens would work.
I mean, just look at how many Star Trek aliens have two hands and feet, speak English, have facial expressions corresponding to emotions, and so on. (There's a good link in one of my other comments in this thread.)

To back-of-the-envelope what 51% for an hour might cost: if the mining rewards for an hour is 150 BTC, around $45,000, then 51 percent should get you around half that. So even multiplying that by ten it should only cost $200,000.

Given a powerful enough victor, you could recover private keys.
But assuming we're only talking about rewriting the blockchain: you can only remove transactions, not create new ones. Assuming the sender only ever signed one transaction for each output, eventually the tx will have to be allowed in the chain if the victors ever fall below 50%. Even if they keep it out, it doesn't help them too much. They can't spend other people's money. The only thing gained is that nobody else can send money, and they can double-spend coins they previously owned.
The blockchain would quickly become untrustworthy anyway, in that situation. We seem to be assuming that the enemy doesn't control the internet, so people would know this.

OTOH, someone who can monitor both ends of the network is explicitly [not part of Tor's threat model](
But he might not have been in a place where the NSA could monitor both his traffic and the email server's traffic at the same time, or he could have used proxies or connected in random wifi-hotspots, or sent a lot of extra data to throw off the network analysis, or whatever.

Why would it be impossible? You simply deny that there's a hidden partition. I have several truecrypt volumes on my computer, some with hidden volumes and some without. There is no way to tell from the outside which ones are which.

All of those problems were with an earlier version of truecrypt, or using a hidden volume inside an operating system. If you use it as a hidden operating system, then you aren't vulnerable. There are a lot of precautions needed, but if you take all of them there are no known attacks.
I'm very familiar with the background of truecrypt, I remember when it was taken down. It's the only software of its type that's been [audited]( though. The FBI once tried for a year to crack it and gave up.
It still seems secure to me.

It's not quite having the files in free space. The way hidden volumes work is that you create a non-hidden volume that can be, say 100GB. (Making up a number.) Then you make sure only to use 10GB of that. You also create another volume inside the last 85GB of your outer volume. This hidden volume contains what appears to be random data, and nobody can show that it exists.
If you were to only make a single volume, the last 85GB would also have random data. So the only way to confirm that it exists is to know the passphrase.

Why would they do that? That's not reasonable, and it's also not what he claimed in the defense.
Some of the chats also explicitly laid out the plan to pretend that there were multiple DPRs, iirc, which was presented at the trial.

So we're back to ignoring the record: the defense didn't follow the proper procedure to call the witness, so it was denied. You'd know this if your information was from the source.
Just because you won't look up the reason doesn't mean there was no reason.

I'm not so sure how accurate this is legally; there are 5th amendment rights which do apply to passwords (but not fingerprints or physical keys), and the prosecutor probably wouldn't be allowed to mention it in court.
But even if it is, truecrypt hidden volumes are impossible to find if you don't know they're there. It stores the info in the free space of your other encrypted partition, and can't be accessed without the second key. You can give up the first key and it would look exactly the same as if you really only had set up a regular volume.
