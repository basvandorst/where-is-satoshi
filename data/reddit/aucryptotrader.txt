Was an obvious hit piece in my opinion, I don't doubt he's done some dodgy shit but can we really believe that those people would share that info on television if they weren't receiving large sums of money?
The guy that funded the doco had been after McAfee for years too.

Terrible advice, where I live it's the middle of winter.

This is all bullshit, the system is designed to keep as many people in the negative as possible, that's why they offer credit cards to kids as they're leaving school etc.  Just because it doesn't draw you in doesn't mean you have no other flaws.

Pretty far actually.   But only because I can see how the system is designed to fuck people.

If the government printed money instead of the fed (private company) then what's the difference?  Why take loans from the central bank then pay them back with interest instead of just printing your own money?  It's the biggest scam the world has ever seen.  Not to mention that you couldn't just print more gold so talking about "runaway inflation" when there was a gold standard is just nonsense.
