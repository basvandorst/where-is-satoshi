then again, Satoshi didn't probably envision petahashes of computing that would almost neutralize any likely possibility of doublespending. He may have assumed that risk under a much small scaler than it is today which would have been an accurate assessment.

Its been a long long time ago in the US. Never got any traction and wont probably get any in the EU. Shows how little bitcoin community knows about payments in general. Amazon has virtual coins and Groupon has Gbucks.

So you said something not knowing to be true or false as it was financial and not fintech and Googled after I replied just to make sure you were right about what you said, but still wrong and now are sidestepping the issue that you're still wrong. Financial, not fintech. Fart.

Hi tough guy. Why don't you give the IRS your name and SSN and tell them so?

Here's the thing. I told my 14yr old brother day before to find someone, start commenting and to troll you for a while, so he could steal valuable time you could have used to do something productive, while I was actually doing something productive. I ran some errands, got back to my emails, and read up on BIP32 , and got you to keep doing this. Because I(well not me) was able to steal your time away, (hence parts of your life you won't get back), I'm sorry but that's what i call a life kill. really sorry, dont feel bad. I was only mildly amused.

Cough. You googled this after I replied. And cough. Financial is different than fintech. Cough. Even literally. Sneeze. Fart.
