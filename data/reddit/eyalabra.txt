Thanks, Security and trust are defiantly a challenge and I agree that trusting a 3rd party takes us a way from the decentralised concept.
This problem is even bigger for the regular people that are not tech savvy.   
Do you have a speaker that can recommend that covers that subject.

what is the best way to reach them ?

A great Agenda 
@_date: 2014-12-29 14:12:23
I believe that bitcoin is much more than an investment or currency.
What about the technology ?

thanks

Instead of offering a real cure they push STEROIDS to the market, at the end the economy will get a hurt attack!
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:45:18
thank you 
@_date: 2014-12-24 17:03:55
It will be and I hope to see you there 
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:04:03
Building the economy is a challenge maybe "the challenge" but this no different from the early days of the credit cards.
I would really like to add it to our agenda can you recommend a speaker for our virtual expo ?
@_date: 2014-12-29 08:39:11
your voice should be heard more, it is important to have someone from the industry that can share his knowledge and insights, I invite you to be part of the blockchain virtual birthday party a virtual events with thousands of bitcoiners from around the world. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:34:19
Excellent piece, it was a real pleasure reading it, I would love to hear more. I would love to have you as a speaker at our online meet up. 
Good work 
@_date: 2014-10-06 17:46:28
Good point, but I do not think it can be avoided. 
and maybe this is a good sign, that even the skeptical are starting to get in.
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:07:42
I am going with the chicken.
Adoption first and rest will follow!
@_date: 2014-10-06 17:58:38
The multi sig certainly looks like a step in the right direction.
@_date: 2014-12-29 14:00:25
thank you 
@_date: 2014-11-28 18:12:44
Not really, there are a lot of things that can be done via the blockchain 
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:54:59
who is going to replace them?
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:56:05
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:06:33
The question is how you build trust for the masses.
@_date: 2014-10-14 09:26:35
Hi 
What do you see as the main challenge of the bitcoin economy?
adoption?volatility or security
