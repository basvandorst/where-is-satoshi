I'm having a similar problem.  I bought some and it showed up as pending then disappeared.   So I bought again.  Sent it out, ( it never hit the blockchain, still waiting)  then the first one reappeared.  Very strange as they have always been smooth for me

It isn't clear why Bitcoin would be a good fit for Paypal?  Hmm... that is interesting.

Well in a very strict technical scene, all wallets only exist on the blockchain.  What an individual has is the key to send to another address.
The term "wallet" is just used to make it simpler to grasp what is happening.
Hardware wallets just hold keys and sign transactions offline on the device.  
The 12 word password will be able to be redeemed at other places than legder, I am just uncertain if every wallet provider will use the same algorithm to generate your seed key.  
Sorry for this long post, I just wanted to cover all bases to your question.

Trezor sends the signed transaction to a PC when sending.  This way your private keynis never revealed on anything that touches the internet.
As for the 12 word seed, I believe you can access with other wallets but it may not be all. 
 I know ironically enough you can online lol
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:00:14
Yes.

Whao yeah, my mistake.  You are right.  Thanks for the heads up!  I thought I had posted it in the r/supportsubredditforcirle but something must have happened while typing that in and it got sent here.  Thanks again!
@_date: 2016-10-24 00:22:24
I know I'm sorry man.
