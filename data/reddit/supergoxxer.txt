You are correct. ETH doesn't scale, not by a long shot. CryptoKitties nearly killed their network, and that was just a faddish collectible game.
World computer? Right. Not when your contract code has a wide attack surface, and "sharding" won't help any. They've delayed the real "upgrade" for a while, because they know it isn't going to solve anything.
Kick the can, just like the Central Banks would ;)

He was a bad actor since the Bruce Wagner days.
But memories are short, and everyone lines up to suck Voorhees kneecaps because he managed to make a pile of money.
Then he decided to be part of the back-room NYA S2X deal.
Then he decided to align with Roger Ver.
He has a history of bad choices, ethically corrupt and basically would compromise anything in the pursuit of just one more point of profit.
Good riddance.

Sorry dude, but its like talking to a flat-earther.
We know physics works, so we don't bother. Same thing with Bitcoin versus BCash, most times you are better off letting their network get totally socked - like their recent departure of 27% of the total hashrate.
As long as we don't have idealistic devs that "save" them from their own stupid shit, they'll implode on their own. Just sit back and watch the show.
Especially the multiple forks from Craig "Faketoshi" Wright/Calvin Ayre (Coingeek pool) and "Cobra" (BCash dev).
And that's just the ones we know about. Fun times.

There are rumors that this is happening in Venezuela. The government has been confiscating ASIC miner gear and many believe they are using it in their own facility.

Gavin is a spineless turncoat that went to the CIA, tail tucked between his legs -- which accelerated/coincided with Satoshi noping out from the project.
Oh, and then he decided to give a con-man legitimacy even though he admitted the presented evidence wasn't wholly convincing.
After all that, and then aligning with the whole S2X Ver crowd -- fuck this guy.
I don't care if he helped mother teresa cross the street, turning into an complete antipode of what he was means he loses all credibility he ever had.

How about Jihan and his S2X bullshit -- 
Some other fun:
Most of BCash nodes on 12 ASNs - 
Roger claims that its "impossible to even try" to use Lightning --  
Roger's Seoul Meetups in South Korea - tumbleweeds - 
Craig Wright admits he helped DHS spy on Tor users - 
FuzeX Card - promises a bunch of cryptos, then partners with Ver dropping BTC - scam much? - 
And finally, as a very rich dessert that will take a while to digest because its so *FULL OF DRAMA* -- At least 3 - 4 forks are on the horizon for BCash -- 
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:51:43
My personal theory is one of them ends up dumping big before the other does, because that's the only way to redeem some of the lost capital they wasted on holding BCash.

What you're seeing here firmly falls within your discipline, as you already know.
The way other coins are rushing into implementations with nearly zero testing is what is concerning. Going from full theory to real code and then trusting your ideas to be completely bulletproof all the while risking everyone's collective wealth is reckless folly.
There's a reason that consensus methods that scale are very few in number, and some haven't been proven to be invariant yet.
Its a difficult problem, and that is why alts and "app" coins like ETH are running headlong off a cliff -- they have zero choice, bound by the shortcomings of their original design.
It doesn't look like its going to end well, at all.

Lyin' Ver did this on purpose.
All the other altforks just churn away and attempt to compete on merit, while this Douchetarian in Tokyo name-camps domains and spews all kinds of duplicitous garbage.
The confusion is necessary to his model, because he knows he can't compete on merit alone. This should be the big red flag, because if Lyin' Ver is willing to do this to promote his stuff -- what else is he capable of?

Nicely done.
Very Wrong Ver inspires a different narrative in his followers heads than what is happening in reality, so they have to contort -- pretzel like, to fit things to their view.
This results in more ridiculous externalities, ie., "core conspiracy" instead of simply "BCash Sucks". It won't become obvious until they've been painted into a corner and their pretzel-logic shatters.
Just another chapter in the sad history of scammers and con-men.

Sure, we won't agree on everything. 
I don't think you are correct on Lightning, that's all. As for "market dominance", that is primarily computed using the flawed metric "marketcap" which is a piss-poor way to compare things.
It doesn't account for actual utility, instead using &lt; num coins &gt; * &lt; trading price &gt; to come up with a number. So even a alt-coin that doesn't get traded much can beat another coin that has utility and has more usage.
As for mining, competitors in the ASIC space are ramping up, most notably the involvement of fabbing giant Samsung.
There's more in store, it isn't all bad.

So what. You have a paper market that doesn't have any way of securing more Bitcoin to back their fractional derivative crap.
They can't "dilute" Bitcoin, they can't reasonably try to "corner" it either. This isn't shares in a company run by some corrupt CEO.
They can play their paper games, but it won't matter too much when it comes to the OTC market and other mechanisms.
The bottom line is, there's less than 4 million Bitcoin remaining, and that issuance will halve in the not-too-distant future.

Trillions in debt, 5 year treasuries at 2.5%, 30 year at 3.25% and climbing, imminent rate hikes coming from the FED.
Given the large amounts of sub-prime auto debt, the housing craze at near pre-2008 levels, cancellation of corporate buy-backs in equities, and even Goldman warning there will be no liquidity once a big drop hits in the markets -- it isn't so far-fetched after all.
Add on top of that flaming tire fire that US Pensions are massively underfunded, CALPERS spinning its wheels assuming 7.5% gains in markets barely achieving half that amount -- and other pensions across the USA that are dire straits, leading to local tax increases to plug the hole -- yeah, things are looking pretty shitty.
I could also add that most households in the USA can't handle an unexpected expense of 1k, (for some even lower), and live essentially paycheck-to-paycheck with nearly zero savings.
Oh, and the FDIC, that entity you think will back-stop your bank account up to 100k, is also lacking the funds necessary to do anything close to that.
But keep your money in a bank, because its ALWAYS safe, lol. *(At least that's what they want you to think, amirite?)*

The fee lie - Everyone can see that roger ver is lying again when there are literally no txs in the  mempool and 5 sat txs are in the next block 
More fee lies from "Bitcoin Judas"
Roger Ver lies more often than he tells the truth. This is not an attack, just an objective observation of the facts.
"Mt. Gox is totally fine." ( ... shortly thereafter Mt. Gox implodes ... "I am here to 'apologize'. Even though everything I said when I told you 'Mt. Gox is fine' was true, I am sorry that some of you lost money when it collapsed. Buy ether."
"I am banned from posting in ... accidentally posts to ... "Oops. Now I'll pretend like I never claimed to be banned from and ignore anyone who asks me about that claim."
"I've dumped a few hundred BTC for BCC"... 2 weeks later: "I haven't sold a single Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash up until yesterday"
He lies about the subreddit he controls. He regularly lies about his holdings. He lied and scammed his way into the bitcoin.com domain, which he uses to push out FUD about Bitcoin and its developers. He lies on agreements he signs (e.g. "the bitcoin.com pool will mine with NYA/btc1/2x code... whoops just kidding, we're mining bcash instead"). He even had the audacity to lie about what happened in court, when there is a public transcript available which disproves everything he said.
There are more examples of blatant deception that I don't have the time or patience to dig up right now. Make no mistake: the man is, unfortunately, a sociopath.

If it helps the longer-term trend of crypto displacing legacy banking services, why not?
They tried to divorce the coin from the blockchain, with moderate success, but not with the same level of security.
They're slowly learning that you can't split it down the middle and have all the benefits. 
After a while, they'll grudgingly have to obtain the most popular coin -- because the financial industry will be trading in pairs using it - or tech built upon it.
Banks will just have to learn that, and adapt. The ones that don't will be obsolete -- eventually banking itself will be unrecognizable, permanently changed by cryptocurrencies.

The real fun will be when a certain Money Skeletor Vitalik changes his system to a chimera of PoS and PoW, which won't scale.
Then all the smug talk about how PoW is such a "bad" way to mine will quickly fade. The alt-wreckening will be quite hilarious, including all the ERC20 tokens.

A bit of a summary from the BIP:








*(Source - 
From what I can tell, it randomizes what peer it chooses to route a transaction through. *(More detail on the Github wiki --

All propogated and mediated by the Lightning network, which collectively shows the will of the people you're trying to serve.

Here's some facts for you, chum.
 -- See the wiggling blue line? See the wiggling orange line WAY above the blue one?
Your altfork has shit transaction volume. Its nearly been a YEAR since Lyin' Ver forked off, and it STILL has anemic usage.
Supplemental chart --  -- See how the blue and orange lines are compressed together? That's your "high fees" narrative being shredded on a daily basis.
And that doesn't even INCLUDE Lightning, where you pay cents *(or less)* for numerous transactions. But no, you Cashie fucks never mention that - because it would make you look like the idiots you are.
You've swallowed Roger's load without a single critical thought, and it shows.
There's your reality -- backed up by FACTS and CHARTS. Maybe look at them - if you can wrap your little walnut brain around them.

Also, for some reason he has a New York/Jersey accent that sounds like he is talking around a mouthful of half-chewed hotdog.

Proof-of-(mis)Stake simply recreates all the problems with the conventional monetary system in digital form.
Steemit, using their Steem token uses a Delegated PoS system that has onerous requirements for their "witnesses" to run nodes. No one runs one at home, they're all racked in a datacenter somewhere.

Think 200 million is enough? Not in the world of hardware, especially when you don't own your own chip fab.

The big "tell" is that relative hashrate compared to BTC for RogerCoin (ABC) has fallen under 3%, and even 2% at times. It used to be much higher. Bitmain can't keep up the charade, even under other pool names -- it doesn't make a difference in the total hashrate picture.
When Jihan and the others get ousted from Bitmain itself, the next order of business is to get rid of underperforming assets on the books. Big 'ol firesale of shitcoins and physical holdings.

First part, dry and technical, second part "oh man, its *SO* stressful guys", third part "I don't know how to pay people even though I did the technical setup just fine."
He's a Ver supporter pretending to "test". All he's doing is trying to perpetuate the narrative that Ver has been shifting to - "no one uses Lightning" and the rest.
Good riddance.

Right, so you just equated hard to produce hardware that has finite limits in producing said miners - no one can just suddenly snap their fingers and have a country-worth of miners in one go -- to a system that only requires you accumulate a shit-token to have influence.

You obviously missed the memo when all the Chinese exchanges were spoofing volume non-stop. OkEx was famous for it, as well as Huobi.
They have a very aggressive mindset that any means is okay to justify the ends, in this case, being the most traded exchange -- even if they use bots to fake volume.

*(In terms of service fees and packaging it to their customers.)*

As long as you're browsing in the pedantic section of the mental supermarket, you might as well admit there's a LARGE disparity between investing in hardware that is slow and difficult to produce, versus having a staking system where all you do to gain more influence is buy more shit-tokens.

Its purely optics. Ver is a predictable sleazy fuck, and I can see how he'd use this to spin his talking points.
And no, I won't expound on that - because fuck that guy, he's not too imaginative, so why help him out on that score.
While the advertising theory holds water, I think it will just be used to emphasize Roger's spin -- he's worried that Lightning is the cat out of the bag scenario, and he doesn't have much to counter with that -- so this overfunded node is probably all he could think of.
Just the result of Cashie death spasms - except Roger is such a drama queen we get a ringside seat to the freakout.
@_date: 2018-07-09 02:50:11
I agree, I think he's borderline psychopathic.
The "middle finger" interview with Matt showed his true colors. Ver isn't a guy objecting to a nickname, no -- this is the glimpse into unhinged mental behavior.
He slams Matt's business, lords his money over Matt as some status/class play, then finally cuts off the interview like a child being told to clean his room.
That is mental fragility to me, and even though he issued a non-apology video later -- I see that Ver's mental state is wobbling and I wouldn't trust him to order me a cab, much less run a altfork.
If I'm right, things will ramp up to a degree that even his sleazy talking points and lies won't be able to cope with, ultimately culminating in a huge hissy-fit-ego-meltdown as reality smacks him in the face.
It should be highly amusing.

That's a bit naive.
You know full well that people use top-level domains to anchor their projects. Dot org, com, and the rest. We're talking perceptions here, which is exactly why snake-in-the-grass Ver is holding on to the Bitcoin dot com site so tightly.
He knows that the regular lazy internet user is going to that TLD first. *Maybe* the org site after. If they're adventurous enough.
Most won't.
TLD domains absolutely matter when it comes to newbies, who won't know any better. To claim otherwise is disingenuous.

Not exactly, no.
Volume in futures is small compared to OTC/BTC Exchanges. Cash-settled means they would have to hold coins either on the other exchanges or in their own wallets.
Either way, futures are primarily a HEDGE for the underlying.
Another point - when futures go "discount" to the underlying price *(happens on large declines for a short while)* THAT is when arbitrage pulls that back up.
Futures typically maintain a price premium to the underlying otherwise.
Did you know in the last Commitment-of-Traders report *(or was it the more frequent positioning reports, I forget)* that the bulk of the BTC Futures positions are short? Like 78% of open interest.
That's a crowded trade, and things like that scream reversal to me.

Obligatory link to Lyin' Ver's "Greatest Hits" -- 
The dude keeps spewing his shit, and he isn't slowing down. Lightning just upped the cycle of crazy pretzel logic that he uses to smear Bitcoin with.
It will come to a head though, Bitpico is actively trying to setup a majority fork -- using techniques to "stress" the Cashie chain to the point of failure.
Even if that doesn't come to fruition, the creeping desperation is seeping into the narrative. I've followed the poison rumors and lies that Ver spews, and there has been a definite change in tack since Segwit/Lightning came on the scene.
Jihan's Antpool is mining full blocks on the BTC chain - where he would normally mine empty ones. It seems that Roger is losing allies, and even a whole tide of gullible fools won't save him.
He's losing hashrate, allies and slowly, his mind. His credibility got shot a long time ago, and he hasn't realized it fully yet.

Proof-of-Stake depends on you having a "stake" in the network. That means accumulating shit-tokens so you can do operations on said network.

Very Wrong Ver is suffering from a few things.
My personal theory is he's spiteful that people didn't laud him in the early days - to his satisfaction - or that the accolades he got were eclipsed by other things.
This created a stewing psychological shitstorm, so when the opportunity came for Very Wrong Ver to use his newly-created wealth, he decided to not use it in a beneficial way - like say "The Pineapple Fund" - but to attempt to wrest control of Bitcoin.
Power always corrupts, and Very Wrong Ver has been trying his best to have top-level control using his funds and personal goals.
In his mind, Bitcoin must be punished, and he'll do whatever he can to achieve this.
This doesn't mean he will succeed, only that Very Wrong Ver is blind to the reality of what is going on.

Wrong, the first altcoin was Freicoin.
You're right Namecoin came before Litecoin by a few months, but honestly no one cares about Namecoin or Freicoin - so its all the same in the end.
Litecoin was the first *memorable* alt-coin, so its seen as the first alt that had any real usage.

Very Wrong Ver is essentially building a "ghost city" like they have in China.
Lots of apartment tower blocks, roads, sidewalks. Tons upon tons of concrete. But lacking one critical component.
BCash tx volume is quite simply, anemic.

He doesn't have the users or the developer talent, and everyone knows it.

Easy. You have 1,000 USD in your fictional bank account.
* Bitcoin Price: 8,351
* Litecoin Price: 132
With that money, you can buy:
* Bitcoin: 0.1197
* Litecoin: 7.57
Your influence on the Bitcoin market is minimal, but your influence on the Litecoin market is more pronounced, a difference in quantity of **6,224 %**.
This is why comparing the two and saying their relative percentage changes are equivalent is a logical fallacy. Its much easier to move a lower priced market than a top priced one.

You're being extremely disingenuous here.
You have to understand the psychology of what is going on, not what you can recite as "facts".
When someone has an interview on cable tv and the label says "CEO" and then a site that ends in .com -- the immediate connotation made is that they are the CEO of that thing.
No one is going to double-check unless they're super nerdy, and frankly most people aren't. They take what they see on news shows as vetted facts.
This is part of Very Wrong Ver's toolkit of deception, and he knows it.

Very Wrong Ver has been using his platforms to spread his message, and I'm not surprised some people get caught in that net.
The lies and half-truths that tumble from his .com site are hard for new people to discern. I think they can be reached though, if the trend of exposing the lies continues.
One thing I would ask a BCH supporter is:
"Do you want to be that person?"
In the sense that - hey, you got into this, but it isn't YOU. Its Very Wrong Ver's falsely constructed universe. You can always change. There is no downside for saying "you know what, this guy is wrong" and changing your mind.
I seriously ask them to reconsider, because Very Wrong Ver only cares about one thing -- himself.

Let 'em fork, it won't make a fucking difference.

Very Wrong Ver has positioned himself as a leader, and by using the camped domain of the .com site, he infers a connection - which for most people is enough.

@_date: 2018-04-30 15:06:59

They can call their "product" that - but it belies the underlying con, which is riding the coat-tails of an established name.
If they didn't NEED the Bitcoin name, they could rename their fork and compete on pure merit.
But they won't - because mimicry and social attacks is the crux of Roger's egoist strategy.

@_date: 2018-04-30 03:26:58
Because the distance between using power and economic incentives is much reduced when your product is essentially currency.
Other industries have many other inputs and losses along the way. Bitcoin mining, on the other hand, has become a highly quantifiable business with known inputs and profit margins.
Its much less variable than other things in terms of complex feedback loops, and easier to estimate overall economically positive incentives.
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:09:25

Very Wrong Ver's level of desperation is increasing.
The "burn" BCash Fee post, the resurgence of his trolls on various platforms, he even came back to Steemit, for fucksake - that's niche as hell, and he has to hit them all to keep treading water.
If I had to guess, I'd say Roger's biggest fear is that after all of his effort and money, after all the interviews and BCash pumps, *(done prior for optics)* that it will end with him being a minor footnote in crypto history.
The thing he is most scared of is not being discussed at all.
And it's coming.

@_date: 2018-04-25 20:59:32
I wrote this on another reply, but here it is in summary:
Very Wrong Ver positions himself as "CEO", attached to his camped .com site. The inference is he controls the coin - even if the facts seem incongruent.
Its also been proven to a degree as he's been the one issuing dictums and missives about how BCash is going to do certain things -- that's what a CEO does.
Very Wrong Ver has also stated that he wants to displace Bitcoin with his ego-project.

@_date: 2018-04-22 01:46:37
I know, the last three hours there's only 117 BCash transactions. No one is using their network, so the "burned" fees are a mere trickle, even at 12% of the total.
What makes me laugh about this is the level of desperation that is needed where they rationalized this was a good idea.
Its a bit like a bar, when it starts to fail and business is slow, they resort to the trifecta of Trivia Night, Deep Happy Hour Discounts and Stand-up Comedy night.
Its a whirlpool of failure swirling down the drain.

This will come in waves. Nothing gets accepted overnight, it just seems that way to our meat-brains. Bitcoin has been making inroads for going on 9 years now.
Its much like when it begins to rain, and the street still looks a bit dry, with darkened dots of raindrops hitting the surface. Then all the little nooks and crannies get filled in, and BLAM, the surface of the street now looks wet.

I'd also add that BCash is a mimicry and brand-camping attempt to socially-engineer control over a cryptocurrency.
If any of the BCash advocates meant anything they say, they'd be able to change the name, sans Bitcoin, and compete on merit.

I'll field this one.
Very Wrong Ver has been constantly doing things to affirm his wrongness, and its reached a pitch where people will naturally react.
Please view this history, its important for context -- 
This doesn't happen overnight. 
People don't sit down and decide to post a very thorough and documented article on something unless the situation demands it.
And that is what Very Wrong Ver has prompted. 
His underhanded tactics, deception, mimicry, social engineering attacks -- all of these has pushed and prodded people so far, that they're willing to expend energy to correct it.
So no, it isn't a problem that BCH is being discussed -- the real problem is that Very Wrong Ver doesn't know when to stop, how to stop -- or even entertain the idea that his push for power is corrupting the very thing he says he "loves".
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:14:36

@_date: 2018-04-27 18:09:19
Very Wrong Ver's strategy is exactly that.
Its about deception and duplicity. If he had forked and called his coin "VerCoin" or "MyVisionCoin", no one would care - it would compete on merit.
But he isn't.
Its a dangerous game, because that kind of cognitive blindness and lack of moral compass will end in tragedy.
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:06:25
Very Wrong Ver has a big problem.
He's finally overstepped the line where there's true liability. This is because of his cognitive blindness. He wants power over Bitcoin so badly, that he can't see anything else.
If he had forked and called his effort "VerCoin" or "MyVisionCoin", then no one would care - it would be competing on merit.
But Very Wrong Ver didn't do that -- he decided that trickery and deceit was the order of the day. Con-men and scammers have the same lack of moral compass, and they all end up self-destructing before long.
I suspect the same forces are at play, and an equally tragic ending.

Code is a meritocracy.
If you have good ideas, and good code to back them up - there really isn't much to stop you.
If you don't like it, you can split off and do your own thing -- happens in Open Source all the time.
Bitcoin has a consensus because participants understand what is happening, and future proposals are under the BIP standard for discussion and review.
You can't get more open than that, frankly.

Cognitive Dissonance exhibits itself in various ways.
When the artificial reality of their narrative shattered, they pivoted to the next hallucination to keep their fake universe intact.
This will, of course, end up in tragedy as the walls of reality closes in -- and the last rationalization dies a horrible death. Many will simply snap, because they can't possibly admit they've been wrong.
@_date: 2018-04-29 23:16:31
Its been fascinating to see the Very Wrong Ver crowd try to rail against Lightning.
They first had the fee argument, then that was torn to tatters.
Now they're arguing that Lightning is flawed, even though there's a large growing network.
Even if there are initial issues, the whole longer-term view looks very good. Its like they can't see the forest for the trees.

I'd like to point out that Very Wrong Ver has U.S. customers, so it very much applies.

Very Wrong Ver has taken a long serpentine path to where he is today.
That's the basic problem, and I don't see a solution to it unless he decides to stop.

But it hasn't. So in short, Roger Ver is a complete lying Douchetarian.

Roger has 500k twitter followers, a whole subreddit of goons, and he's been on TV Networks globally.

Also, there is no proof they don't own the private keys of the address they're using to "burn" coins, so it could easily be a complete lie, just for PR purposes.

Very Wrong Ver's coin is down -12.5% right now. Bitcoin is down 3.8%
I've found that when BCash falls, it falls hard and fast - and at a greater percentage than Bitcoin.
Its true, take a look at the charts.
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:56:16
Prior to every BCash pump, Roger is talking at an event or is on a TV News segment somewhere.
They may have altered their playbook a bit since some people noticed, but it usually happens on days like today where most coins aren't doing anything - but suddenly BCash soars off of nothing.
@_date: 2018-04-29 23:25:04
Bitcoin doesn't need any affirmation from the bankers, central or otherwise.
It is designed to replace them all.

One thing at a time.
You're talking about Bitcoin becoming a "unit of account", which is a logical progression as a currency. This doesn't happen all at once, you must surely realize.
When more things become denominated in Bitcoin, then that process gets easier. Lightning will likely have a big part in making that transition accelerate due to its micro-payment friendly network.
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:03:44
To be clear, and I've said this a few different ways -- Very Wrong Ver is positioning himself to be associated with his brand. In this case, he makes sure the "CEO" label is juxtaposed with the camped .com site.
This inference makes it seem that he's in control - and when he issues dictums and announcements about the direction of BCash, that is exactly how he's perceived.
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:23:34

Very Wrong Ver continues his attacks, while still being completely wrong.
No surprise right? A used car salesmen rooks in buyers by pretending the car he's selling is worth something. 
Roger Ver pretends his coin is worth something - but its a big lie. It has no more substance than a background in a play - paper thin, smeared with paint.

Very Wrong Ver ensures that this happens by being a persistent liar.

If any of what you said was true, there would be hardly any nodes, and hardly any channels. There also would not be any BTC used to open channels.

Thank you for highlighting this.
Very Wrong Ver could have forked and called his coin "VerCoin" or "MyVisionCoin" and no one would raise a fuss at all.
But he didn't, and the simple fact that he relies on social engineering attacks tells me that he's doing something that isn't what a normal, well-adjusted person would do.
Its the domain of confidence tricksters, hucksters, and grifters. Its using psychological weak points to influence people in a creepy and manipulative way.
Ultimately, I think its a combination of spite and ego. He was into the Bitcoin space for a while, made a LOT of money - and then, when people didn't worship him for his efforts*, he got spiteful and decided to wrest control away -- if he could.
 
*(Note - A real Bitcoin supporter should never expect adulation -- people are boosters because they LOVE the thing they support, not for worship or self-validation.)*
Then the darkness descended, and he is in the full thrall of "they'll pay for not appreciating me" and a bit of ego too.
Its like the classic saying - "those that seek power should never have it" amplified a hundred times over.

Antpool put out a tweet how they're going to take 12% of the fees earned from BCash transactions and "burn" them by sending it to an address that they have zero access to *(or is technically unredeemable.)*
Problem is, there's no proof they're sending it anywhere - they still could have the private keys.
Also, the amounts we're talking here are embarrassingly small. Because no one is using their network, *(Bitcoin is an order of magnitude over their activity, even hourly)*, they will barely send even a few BCH to that address even after a few weeks.
Its mostly a desperation PR move, and not really anything decisive. Even if they managed to "burn" larger quantities - the available supply is north of 17 million coins, so it won't matter much.
Just another stupid decision by the centralized policy makers of that shitfork.

I love this coin, it was fun until certain events rendered it a mess.
Very Wrong Ver has to be rather embarrassed. Who am I kidding, he's just rationalizing why his ego-project is failing as we speak.

When the race to devalue and protect exports truly kicks in, crypto will be the only safe shelter that matters.
That will hasten pricing things in crypto, because nobody wants to weigh wheelbarrows of fiat, or even accept it.
Its coming, the big unwind will be part of the credit crunch coming out of Asia or elsewhere. Maybe even the USA if the debt keeps stacking up.
Whatever the catalyst, fiat is doomed.

I have no doubts Very Wrong Ver would love a market that he could freely manipulate. 
After all, he told an audience on a popular cable news show he didn't see anything wrong with insider trading --  *(About 5 minutes 20 seconds in to the clip)*

Delegated-Proof-of-Stake is very similar to the legacy fiat system.
Got a pile of money? Check!
Have undue influence because of it? Check!
Steemit uses DPoS, and they have scaling problems and times where the witnesses can't handle the load. Its a flaming garbage ball.
I can't wait for ETH to transition to that broken Proof-of-Stake shit, should be good for a few laughs.

Very Wrong Ver has been using self-promotion under the guise of boosterism to conceal his efforts. Its only recently that the mask has come off, and everyone can see how wrong he is.
I suppose way back some were fooled, or didn't care, but it is much different now.
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:30:57
If BCH could rebrand and cast off the chains of Very Wrong Ver and Falkvinge/Jihan, etc... then there would be an entirely different thing happening.

Your first assertion is again a misinterpretation.

What isn't addressed is how something can lose its utility.
Gold is slowly losing its usefulness. Sovereign states still anchor and underpin the majority of the market, but they are the laggards that will be last to ditch it.
There have been many emerging trends since cryptocurrency bust on to the scene, one being transfer of old stored wealth into digital portable wealth.
The trend continues apace.

The first web browser was horrible.
The first internet experience was slow and difficult.

Good point, looking at  shows the whole picture, Bitcoin has been beating the shit out of BCash, profitability wise, and that no doubt enrages a certain egoist buttchin douchebag.
Its fine, in the long run it only makes incentive to strengthen the network against such fuckery. They'll get routed around eventually.

Here's a real shitpost - BCash is trying to "burn" coins to increase its value. The kicker is, their transaction volume is so anemic, even 12% of it won't add up to jack shit.

Very Wrong Ver has made strides in being a douchebag, no doubt.
The problem is his overwhelming Affluenza that rears its ugly head whenever he's run out of counter-arguments.
He can't help himself, and it shows.

Getting sued is definitely the free market saying "Very Wrong Ver is a liar and a cheat".

Its okay guys, BCashers have cognitive blindness.

His biggest loss will be propping up BCash.
There's a reason that he still holds Bitcoin and mines real Bitcoins. He knows that deep down, BTC is the winner and his little third-rate attempt to usurp control is trading at volumes comparable to TRON, another shitcoin.
It will take some time before reality cracks his ego-bubble, but the resulting meltdown will be entertaining to watch.

One thing that is never mentioned is the tulip contracts were the first futures contracts. Most of what traded never got delivered upon.

Hand-waving hyperbole.
"if you have problem with your Bitcoin", hey, if I leave my wallet on the park bench I'll have a problem too. Your argument doesn't make any sense.
I've had zero problems with my Bitcoin transactions, and I've been using it for years.

Complexity gets abstracted. Everyone knows this. We're on the way to doing that now. You don't have to sit at a commmand line to get transaction going.
Your "safe" fiat is charges on a whirling platter somewhere in the banks infrastructure. Try taking out all of your balance in cash. They will make you jump through hoops to do it, if they'll allow it at all.
The "insurance" you speak of is from an agency that is currently woefully underfunded. Good luck getting anything out of them in a true financial crisis.
I see you're not ready to unplug yet. Sad.

Bitpay sucking is well known.
Legacy financial systems imposing their AML/KYC is well known.

Correct. If lying was illegal then Roger Ver would have a second prison term.

What this really means is GET YOUR BTC OFF Binance.
CZ thinks "oopsie rollbacks" are a viable option, posted about it, took feeback about it. This is beyond deluded. The guy wanted to undo a transaction that was ultimately HIS GODDAMN FAULT for having flawed security around his hot wallet.

Also wouldn't "prior art" claims need for Craig to prove he's satoshi? He can't even move coins from pre 100 blockheight even though he's been asked to many times.

Ross was a tosser that taunted authorities and didn't have enough OpSec to flee the very country hunting him down.
If that useful idiot is some kind of martyr, then you need your head examined. 
And before you tosspots start going on about "what I put in my body hurr durr", just remember that you do so without trying to make a business out of it.

Wrong. CSW needs to be challenged, often and as vocally as possible. The alternative is having his sleazy smirk spewing forth narrative that the media will amplify.
He needs to be called out and his fraud identified and elaborated upon.
Doing nothing is the mantra of defeatist cowards.
