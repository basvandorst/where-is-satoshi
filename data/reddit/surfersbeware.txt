Thank you! :) One of my favorite quotes goes like: "Great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, small minds discuss people." And yes, that's one of the reasons I find Bitcoin so intriguing - it's a brilliant idea which has to be discussed, and not something about a person who wants to be in the spotlight.
I'll leave it to your imagination why mass media is so keen on finding out the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto and doesn't care about pointing out the implications of having an alternative currency system ...

Sooooo, do we get Facebook Credits or whatever? Since Facebook is going for diversification now, I expect something *new* and not just adding some kind of ~~credit~~ debit card wallet in the future. And to be honest, I don't expect to see Bitcoin on the list in the future ...

Well, this is a great idea, but I'd go for asteroid mining first. They are much easier to catch than a tiny space probe ... do you have any idea how much such a massive beast is worth *now*?

Goeden avond! :) Nice to see some Europeans here.
I agree that the path were we are going is looking gloomy, and we have our fair share of anti-whatever here. But the problem is not in giving one crazy guy a bunch of tools, the problem is a whole government abusing the existing tools - or building upon them.  
There are way too many recent stories of using existing technology not the way as it was intended. Think of the truck toll on our Autobahn - designed to get some money from the heavy trucks, but suddenly the system is very interesting to track everybody with it. Uhm, I mean terrorists. For security reasons, of course.
The problem is, this has much larger consequences, and the same goes for encryption. There will be some incident which suddenly makes encryption look like a bad thing. Think of the police not being able to decipher some possibly incriminating hard drives or whatever - of course, some politicians will scream for the regulation of encryption, because everybody can hide illegal stuff with it. Sure, there are nice people using encryption. But they don't have anything to hide, right? Right guys?
And boom, a domino effect starts ...
So to make myself clear: I'm highly sceptical where our goverments are heading, whether it is in the USA, the Netherlands or Germany. But you don't need to wait for some crazy person to come along and use this groundwork, it can happen *now* with political parties. There are politicians who decide stuff they have no idea about, lobbyists who have a lot of money and only one job - influencing politicians! - and there aren't enough people around who actually care about this.
To make one last connection to the rise of Hitler: It's not that there weren't any people who were against him and saw what was happening. It was just that most people didn't care.  
But today, we have the internet.

The thing I took away from the article was not about Bitcoin crushing the banks, but something completely different:


With traditional currency, it's easy to draw a line of "us and the others". A solid economy uses another currency like the neighbors with their high inflation. Sometimes it's a little more difficult, like in the Euro zone, but you won't do much business with, say, Zimbabwe in 2008. Bitcoin enables you to do this.
You can move money between markets who have completely different financial agendas - because Bitcoin doesn't care about it. Try moving 100 USD to South Sudan, or try moving 500 SSP into the US ... I assume it's not as easy as making a Bitcoin transaction. That's where the banks jump in and ~~eat your lunch~~ help you with transaction fees and so on.
@_date: 2014-10-11 19:33:49
Well, this is beautiful and all, but how did they improve on their *products* and *services*?
@_date: 2014-10-11 17:36:05
German here. No, you haven't. From my point of view, you have an even bigger evil in 'Murica: Big agencies etc. that are so vast in their reach that the regular office worker has no clue what he is actually doing there. Rules and laws that are so unbelievable twisted that their actual execution is ridiculous. And a hand full of crazy politicians who want just one thing: More power.
Now, this might somewhat sound like our own ugly history, but there is one key factor missing. When Hitler came to power, he promised a lot of stuff that the people actually wanted, and he met not much resistance. Germany had suffered the First World War, a massive inflation and it didn't look like there was a wonderful future ahead.
Today in America, and correct me if I'm wrong here, it isn't really bad to live. Sure, there are some economically underdeveloped regions, but you'll find them anywhere. It's not like you have to recover from a terrible war and a crippling inflation. Hitler wanted to see the strongest humans at the top, to make space for them, and to throw democracy away.
Well, I don't see any signs of this happening in your country. The thing I see is a governance lusting for more power. Or to be more precise: An agency, and just some selected people of this agency, who have a lot of influence. It's pure lobbyism. They have to win just once, and the people are screwed.
So as a German, I ask you to think twice before throwing this name around. It's easy to personalize something evil in one person. But it doesn't help at all in finding a solution.
@_date: 2014-10-11 20:46:48
Yes, we seem to agree. ;) It's just I'm more into ideas and concepts than people - so if somebody mentions person X in a good or bad context, I get some itch to point out the idea behind it. An idea is much stronger than a single person, and it persists time. This can be both good and bad ...
To take an example from the article the OP posted: The methodical sabotation of security by, uhm, national security agencies surely can't be blamed to a single person. So it is absolutely useless to go to the boss, take his title away and make a press announcement. The very *idea* that doing such things is beneficial has to be destroyed.
@_date: 2013-10-25 17:16:28
This makes sense, storing all of those BTC in one address would be very suspicious. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-05-27 20:11:47
I haven't read up on it that much, but it looks more like an "untrusted" exchange system - the own currency (XRP) is more like "background stuff". This makes it *very* easy to exchange EUR to BTC, or USD to EUR. But I read the sales pitch and the "it's evil!" articles, too ... ;)
It seems much more accessible than Bitcoin, and that's what a normal user is looking for ... Ripple is something different than Bitcoin, that's true.
@_date: 2013-05-28 16:35:21
Right, if it's out there, you can't stop it. See 3D printing ... :)
But it would certainly bother a lot of adopters that they are using potentially illegal things. I for myself know about people who don't use Torrents for *legal* material like downloading a Linux image because they fear their internet provider might monitor their usage and tell the local authority about "huge amount of Torrent activity".
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:25:23
And thank you, too! :)
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:01:23


That seems like a *huge* point everywhere, and I don't think they are only in it to make the world a better place. See Google - the founders might honestly have noble motives, but "don't be evil" doesn't suit them as a motto.
My problem is the standard user: "Oh, I can use Ripple? It sounds easy to use!" And if you tell them about Bitcoin, "yeah, I can use that with Ripple *if I'd want to*". But they won't be interested in the concept anymore.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:13:46
Actually, I've never been to both of these sites. :D
But both of them speak of the original client as the "real deal", so a new user would assume that the default software isn't rocket science.
@_date: 2013-05-29 16:45:17
I don't know very much about the community, just from some vague media reports and about the technical side. Actually I looked up the numbers a few hours ago, those 7 transactions per second are an artificial limit to prevent blowing up the blockchain - Bitcoin could technically handle much larger numbers, but the infrastructure isn't ready yet.
Off-chain transactions for small transactions? Now that sounds interesting, I'll have a look at it ... thanks!
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:15:09
To be honest, I don't remember how exactly I got to the client - some combination of the Bitcoin wiki and Wikipedia, I think. As mentioned in another reply, I haven't been on the "official wallet sites".
@_date: 2013-05-27 19:44:14
That is great advice, but new users don't stumble upon this at once. Maybe I'm not the typical user, but for a newbie the surrounding stuff is a little overwhelming.
@_date: 2013-10-25 17:17:15
As already replied to the other comment, this makes sense - thanks!
@_date: 2013-05-28 16:51:59
Thank you for the explanation, I hadn't grasped the concept of different mistrust levels yet. That clears some things up.
@_date: 2013-05-27 20:04:14
Thank you very much! :) I've seen the tips every now and then in @_date: 2013-05-27 20:01:53
Thank you for the extensive reply - let me pick some points out of there.
I still struggle with inflation and deflation. Actually, I know what they mean for a fiat currency, but I have some trouble adapting the terms for Bitcoins. Since currently I get more and more dollars for one Bitcoin, we have a light inflation. But we have a limited amount of Bitcoins - so there has to be a point where the deflation starts, right? And if we have a deflation, how could we stop it?
The possibility (!) of money laundering is the argument for closed bank accounts after transferring money from Bitcoins here. In my opinion it's exactly the same problem with cash, but for some reason Bitcoin is bad and cash is okay. The media does the rest to promote the view of "you can buy drugs online anonymously with Bitcoins!". Yeah, I've heard you can do the same with cash on the street ... you can use both to do good (buy pizza) and bad (buy illegal stuff), but since there is no widespread acceptance for Bitcoins yet, it is hard to convince people using them.
About the client, I already wrote in other comments about the "stumbling upon it". It's more an adoption problem than a problem for myself.
Bitcoin is young, but extremely powerful - I fully agree that. But I'm a little worried about it's future, especially regarding the legal shenanigans around it here in the EU. So I'll try to educate myself, maybe I can contribute to its popularity over here.
Thank you very much for the BTC! :) I'll try to do something useful with it.
@_date: 2013-05-28 16:58:04
As already mentioned in another comment, I didn't really get the point about the debt yet - but it makes sense now, thanks.
@_date: 2013-05-27 19:42:21
Thank you, but my problem is more with widespread usage: Electrum looks amazingly simple to use, but as a new user, how do I know about such clients? :)
Since I *love* thoughts and ideas (TED ftw!) I will absolutely watch the video.
@_date: 2013-10-25 17:10:16
I don't get it. Did they find his wallet, including access to it (!), or just an address in the blockchain which seems to belong to Ulbricht?
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:50:56
Good point, actually. :)
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:10:26
Now if you could explain the point about the rising debt burden in a short paragraph to me, you're my new financial hero. This is the one point I still don't seem to get about the system ...
@_date: 2013-05-28 18:02:43
I'm living in Germany. Bitcoin has some local popularity here and there (there was an article about Berlin-Kreuzberg in the Guardian last month), but it isn't such a big thing as in the US.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:59:44
Of course there is no money to be made by providing shiny clients and sparkly websites, so there is no incentive to create one. I know about the problem from all the open source software I use - the websites suck (sorry), the applications look like being built by developers (nothing against them, I'm one myself), the communities are full of nerds and so on. ;)


Hold on a second - so the Bitcoin community currently *doesn't* want lots of users? Of course it currently would collapse under the load of hundreds of million users, but what about sudden growth because some big local store chose to accept Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-05-28 16:50:03
You answered the question better than I could have myself.
I didn't *expect* a quick &amp; easy solution, but by ignoring the crypto stuff in the background it actually looks quite simple to use. However, even I as a technically competent user struggled with getting started. It was surprisingly easy to get information about the whole concept and cryptography stuff, but *actually* using it was a little frustrating in the begining.
Maybe the Bitcoin community has to appeal to a widespread audience, if only anarchy-crypto-tech-geeks use it, I still won't be able to buy my coffee in the city.
@_date: 2013-10-25 17:03:15
Well, this depends on the hardware. If it is something like an optical scanner, you might fool it with a piece of paper. If if is something more complex - say, a vein scan, it is *much* more difficult to fool. But is is very fast to use.
The problem I see here is the storage of this biometrics - do they link a transaction for more than, say, 48 hours to my scan? I don't know anything about the laws regarding money laundering in Canada, so please excuse my ignorance.
@_date: 2013-05-28 16:31:32
Yes, hyperinflation is a massive problem, the currency might crash - this could be observed lots of time in the history of mankind.
The reason why we have a steady (or massive ...) inflation rate is to boost the economy by printing money: There's a bigger supply of money than demand by printing a lot of bills, people hope to buy goods and services with it, but there is simply less stuff around than money. The price for goods rise, the value of the money goes down.
Deflation is just the other way around - there's less supply of money than goods and services.
Since I'm not a native speaker, I hope I understood and explained it correctly ...
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:24:01
This is something I read about a little, especially regarding the involvement of banks and the money exchange stuff. If I would open a new bank account, the bank has to check me and attach some sort of identification to it. "This is account 12345, it belongs to surfersbeware, we have checked him."
With Bitcoins a transfer *may* be anonymous, which is the source of all those shenanigans. Of course cash can be used as well, and as far as I understood, it is safer as Bitcoins for illegal stuff. So if a bank, or let's say a money institution could "connect" a Bitcoin account to a person, it wouldn't be problematic anymore.
I don't know about all the licensing details around it (FinCen, BaFin, ...), but it looks like it is possible to use it conforming to the law.
But the interesting point is: If I would staying exclusively in the Bitcoin network (paid for work in BTC, buy my food with BTC), the financial institutions can't say anything about it. They aren't involved until I exchange BTC into a fiat currency. At least that's my impression.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:33:42
Since I'm not the brightest light in the room regarding economics, let me hop onto another statement:


I don't think a full economy (e.g. a country or even the whole world) could get by with a capped supply. Capitalism and inflation did quite a good job to boost the economy and creating stuff, but I really don't know what would happen if we had a capped money supply *and nothing else*.
So I see Bitcoins in the future the same as now: An awesome alternative for payments.
@_date: 2013-05-29 16:36:25
Aaah, now I get it. That's why we have the interest, and that's why there won't be any hyperinflation with bitcoins.
Thanks a lot! :)
@_date: 2013-05-27 19:45:59
Thanks, but as already mentioned in another reply, nobody tells a new user about this. I have quite some experience with IT related stuff but still struggled: Now I understand some things better than before, but a typical new user will surely think "naaah that's to complicated, I'll use PayPal".
@_date: 2013-05-28 20:04:53


Are you kidding me? I'm using a Samsung 840 Pro, too (it's a beast!) - it doesn't help me a thing if the blockchain trickles in at 25 MB per minute. My SSD writes twenty times more *in a second* than this.
@_date: 2013-10-25 17:28:04
I did. But it isn't mentioned explicitely.
@_date: 2013-10-25 19:12:07
I second this. Armory is a much more secure solution than those dozens of steps OP outlined.
Either way, please verify all the downloaded stuff with something like an SHA checksum. Web stuff is generally prone to injections and such things - if I changed your request URL, I could give you my own special edition Raspi image and do nasty stuff with your "clean" USB stick.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:07:54
Thanks for your input - since I've discussed some of the point in other replies, I'll pick a new one out of it:


I heard about it, and I went to their website. So if I would decide to implent it, it would be easier for me as a merchant *and* easier for the customer than, say, PayPal? A 0.99% fee doesn't seem as daunting as using PayPal.
@_date: 2013-05-29 16:31:59
Thanks for the details!
Maybe I should ask around at some banks if they are interested in the concept ... ;)
@_date: 2013-05-28 16:38:32
Already seen them. :) I was one of those "there is a conspiracy everywhere!" guys myself a few years ago, but Bitcoin for me is more like a kind of internet-currency for me.
@_date: 2013-05-28 16:57:22
The point about the IOU is the one thing I haven't really understood about Ripple yet. That makes the whole system look a little bad in regards to Bitcoin ...
As far as I got it, the system *should* be fast, but the middlemen converting the currencies still get a percantage of it. So it might be a little more comfortable to transfer money, but the whole stuff surrounding it looks a little odd to me.
@_date: 2013-05-28 16:43:55
Early adopter? Well, Bitcoin is around since 2009 and still regarded as "new stuff". With all those hipster startups and flashy websites around, it looks very anachronistic to me - my "real" internet activity started around 2000.
I might be a technically competent user and still struggled here and there, but how could Bitcoin possibly get new users this way? (Really, I'm looking for solutions.)
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:14:10
You're looking for a so-called [paper wallet](
@_date: 2013-05-27 20:21:56
Yes, but how do we address them? Or more specifically, what could *I* do about making it easier for the mass to use Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-05-27 20:20:55
As already mentioned, I'm a computer user for about two decades now ... so I know how to stuff lots of relevant information about a topic into my head. ;)
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:43:54
Thank you, now that's something I didn't know about Bitcoin: If it's as easy to use as a credit card for buying stuff online, new adopters will jump on it quickly.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:38:59
Thanks, I'll have a closer look at Bitstamp. Looks dead simple to me. :)
Actually I read a good article about the influence of such articles on the Bitcoin boom ... especially regarding price stabilization. So yes, this seems to be a huge problem, but I think it will smooth out as soon as the userbase is large enough.
I just skimmed your post, your first experience looks very much like mine. :D Well, I got most of the crypto part, but all the stuff around it to actually *use* the system seemed very finicky.
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:54:33
Here's an automatic translation into english:  
To be honest, the article seems a little superficial for my taste. It is a nice overview, but leaves many questions unanswered. But it's nice to see an article about Bitcoin in a nationwide (left-wing) newspaper.
