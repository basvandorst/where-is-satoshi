Actually they'll confirm what he said. Heroin addiction does have a physical component but the addiction itself is very much a behavioral issue. By your logic, once an addict got past the physical dependency then they would be in the clear because that is the reason for their addiction. In reality thats the farthest thing from the truth, and the vast majority of relapses happen after the physical component has been satisfied. The behavioral problems are most certainly comparable with a gambling addiction and are treated in the same way. Trust me on this, I'm a recovering heroin addict and I work closely with addiction professionals at one of the better rehab programs in my area. I'm also the son of a psychotherapist and former psych student (which was ironically derailed by my heroin addiction) so not only do I have a vast clinical knowledge of addiction, I have tons of personal experience and spend the vast majority of my time interacting with addicts and professionals in the addiction field.

Then your friend is very wrong and will quickly learn the reality of addiction when he/she gets out into the field and starts working with addicts on a daily basis. Addiction is very much a behavioral issue moreso than a physical dependency issue. The behavioral patterns, thought processes, and treatments are virtually the same regardless of what the patient is addicted to. There is literally a plethora of research to support this. It's wrong and irresponsible to say that one addiction or addict is stronger or weaker than another. The core components of addiction (ie continual participation in an activity in spite of negative consequences) remain consistent across the entire spectrum of addiction disorders. The op has lost half a million dollars, put unnecessary strain on his sister, and sees no problem with continuing his behaviour. This is literally straight out of every textbook on addiction.
