If words are subjective they are meaningless.

Sounds to me like you don't believe in private property. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I'd tend to agree with you.
You can say whatever you want in an email to whoever you want. As long as it isn't illegal or harrassment, it's good. That is free speech on the internet. Nobody is obligated to give you access to THEIR platform, unless you want to redistribute the means of production.

If interpreting the meaning of words is subjective there is no need to protect free speech because it's indistinguishable from random sounds yelled into a void.

There is no inconsistency in believing that public businesses should not be allowed to discriminate on the basis of race and sexual identity but should be allowed to discriminate based on behavior.   
I mean, you get why it's ok for McDonalds to kick someone out for screaming at patrons but not ok for them to kick someone out for being black, right?

If words only have the power we as individual receivers give them, then free speech is not important. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:33:45
...then why are you suggesting that private companies should be required to give everyone free access to their private property?  
That's what the house analogy was about, dolt.

I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean because in my brain W H Y means cheese and that doesn't make sense by itself with a question mark after it.

Dude, the internet is composed almost exclusively of private property. If we're going to be Capitalists, nobody should be forced to let people use their private property. If you don't like that, join me in the fight against Capitalism.
'Free speech' does not mean the right to say whatever you want wherever you want. Like I said, you have no right to come into my house and start screaming at me about your politics.

Email and internet access are both free. You only have to pay if you want it piped directly to your home. Email is free to the public, and if you don't post anything illegal you can do whatever you want.

Good thing that has no relevance to our conversation.

If you think private companies shouldn't be allowed to choose who uses their property, you're a socialist. Welcome, comrade!
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:16:55
You don't think private companies should be allowed to decide who uses their private property? Welcome to the revolution, comrade!

Dear idiot: Analogies are not straw men.
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:19:16
That sounds like a good argument for not giving a shit about someone getting deplatformed. Words are just sounds, who gives a fuck if some vile bigot can't make a bunch of noise in public using someone else's property?  
If words are just sounds, then there is no need for free speech. If you believe in 'free speech', you clearly believe words are powerful.
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:56:13
Not at all. I'm saying private people and organizations should be able to decide who uses their property. Nobody's free speech is being violated, because everyone can go stand on a street corner and say whatever they want.  
'Free speech' doesn't give you a right to come into my house and start screaming at me. I know, that's a 'dangerous' thought, but it's true.
@_date: 2018-12-17 15:22:27
No, I'm saying they can use different words that they arbitrarily decide to mean the same thing they were censored for saying.
IF words are subjective, which they are not.
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:44:32
Everybody already has the freedom to express themselves. Street corners are free.  
The question we're asking is: Should private companies be obligated to let anyone use their private property? If no, this isn't a problem. If yes, it's time for full socialism.  
I'm cool with either.

Physical assault is not the same thing as murder. It's not even close. Therefore, physical assault is not a problem.

muh freeze peach!!!1!!11!
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:32:43
If words only have the power we as individuals give them, say the same thing that was 'censored' using different words.
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:47:02
Censorship is stopping someone from saying something specific. If words are arbitrary and subjective, decide that different words mean what you were censored for saying, and say that instead.  
Obviously that makes no sense, because words are not subjective.
