It can only par xmr for the subset of coins in the sidechain at best. Not the full protocol. There is a big difference. Defaults matter in design.

sour bc B2X failed 
@_date: 2018-09-04 12:50:13
There is a massive difference between the sets in xmr vs btc. Monero does not mix the coins in a set. It obvuscates the actual signer of a tx with ring sigs so you cannot use statistical analysis retrospectively using probababilities like you can in btc to 'best-guess' who has signed based on value and timing of the subsequent utxo. 
Unfortunately for btc, such a fundamental change would only be achievable with a rather unlikely hard fork. It its current incarnation, bitcoin simply cannot beat monero's fungibility architecture.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:04:29
Ah, I see your perspective.  What I meant to convey is the demand for USD globally might start to decline soon and hence it is almost comparable to an overvalued asset class..
The countries buying the US debt that might soon start to dry up.  Many countries are already engaged in bilateral trade agreements where thy trade using their own currencies instead of the Petrodollar.
This will have significant inflationary pressure on the US sometime in the not-so-distant-future if all that 'paper' starts flowing back to buy real goods and services.  
e.g. Detroit is pretty much owned by Chinese now.  
That means the fall of the USD might end up similar to the tulip craze analodgy where the demand might 'dry up' and revalue the assets to it's true value i.e. basically zero

Volantary viewkeys from users can satisfy regulars when they get a supena from a judge. Like the law and society is supposed to work i.e. privacy by default, vulantary disclosure. Not the inverse as it is with bitcoin atm.
Future cross chain atomic swaps can also enable people to get in and out of fungible blockchains which makes the shapeshift-type services not just redundant, but prohabition regulations against privacy coins unenforcable.
Fun times ahead.

I think it is a bit of an unfair comparison since bitcoin is not a stock.  Using bitcoin as collateral to effectively enable rehypothecation introduces the same (if not worse) fraction reserve principle of the fiat world we are here to displace.

I think he refers to what Andreas explained in the video i.e. we should rather teach people not to give out custody of their private keys and effectively outsource decision making that has a bearing on future protocol development choices as is the case in our current political system of representative democracy.
It also encourages fractional reserve systems to be built yet again on top of bitcoin by the custodians as is the case in our current fiat banking system.  We should rather aim for a 100% reserve ratio designs together with no counter party risk as far as possible like the lightning network and similar 2nd layer payment channel levels enable.

Time to rewrite the laws to systematically abandon the IRS.  Just have value added tax based on consumption instead of one's contribution to society.  Bitcoin will lead the change.  It will be impossible to track all crypto currencies to enforce such regulations anyway.  The invention is out of the box.  Lets adapt to the invention, don't just react with the old school of thought.  We can re-write history from here on for the next century to come.  Our previous generations made a mess out of the financial system that lead to wars and business cycles induced by central banking.  Time to think bigger than just currency here.  It is a new financial system of value transfer.  Old rules don't and cannot be applied or enforced.

The most common denominator is the fascination of the re-invention of most things we used to believe in and took for granted, the most obvious of which is money, the proxy of human labor exchange.

I am using 'FUD' in the context of having optimism that the majority of weaknesses in the protocol could be addressed by innovations that are available to us.  There is no denying that the miner centralization is a huge huge concern.  
That is why I am also diversifying my risks personally by looking into alt coins too. 
But it is good to be reminded by the likes of the OP what the fundamental ideas were that we need to try and uphold.  
Hopefully the issues we face are temporary ones that we can solve as a community and when ultimately looking back it can be seen as 'FUD'.  Not so funny at the moment, I agree.

I just posted a view on a similar thread i.e.:
I think it is a typical mainstream saying (i.e. "Don't invest more than you can lose") from people that are generally very risk averse. 
These days there are very few middle class people that can 'afford' to lose any more they earn anyway. They are being squashed by the fiat tax system and inflation from all sides. I would rather see this phrase being applied to gambling than investing in Bitcoin.
The inverted risk i.e. not to invest is also worth considering. Although hard to quantify the upside, the potential upside far outweigh the potential downside. One could rationally apply Pascal's Wager though pattern to investing in Bitcoin. (for wikibot):

I would argue that Bitcoin should not be advocated to be an "intermediate currency" but an independent competing form of money that does not need to be converted back to corruptible fiat money to transfer value.

I would ironically argue that the reverse is true i.e. it will take a big economic reset (e.g. a fiat monetary system collapse) before a society will return to good money.  Refer to Gresham's Law .. (for wikibot:)
..that basically says that fiat money (bad money) temporarily replaces good (sound) money (e.g. gold/bitcoins).  That is also why I believe prudent Bitcoin enthusiasts, who generally understand the monetary systems' workings (because I believe they are generally better educated), hoard bitcoins and gold because we expect the re-evaluation to inevitably happen in the near future because of the debasement of the fiat money by the central banks and the Federal Reserve.
An interesting paradigm shift that Jon Matonis mentioned in a recent speech was that Bitcoin could move us again into a post-legal-tender age.  It will be an interesting social change to be part of.  What I mean by that is I am wondering when the reverse of Gresham's Law (Thiers' Law) will kick into place i.e. people will start fleeing towards sound competing forms of money again as soon as the interest rates inevitably starts rising or the over indebted governments hyper inflate their fiat monies.  People will start losing their faith in fiat and choose money with a longer term store of value. 
Hence even government decree could not stop the tsunami and even corrupt tender laws will bow the knee to humans' need for self-preservation of their wealth.
I think the way to increase the circulation of bitcoins could be the inverse, i.e. merchants should offer a discount to bitcoin buyers because of its deflationary design that also contributes (amongst many other utility attributes) to making it a better store of value. 
TL;DR: Sell your fiat hot potatos and hoard your precious bitcoins.  Ask for discounts if paying with bitcoins.  Human behaviour is quite predictable and history repeats itself, thus Bitcoin will eventually go visit the moon.

I truly love the initiative and the product surely looks very promising.  I would recommend at the very least you guys allow for is multi-sig addresses and let the users control their PKs whilst you guys could hold one of say three keys to help authorize transactions.  It is the one main thing that differentiate Crypto currencies from fiat i.e. trustless cash.  If you guys reach that goal whilst making the app simple you have a product that could go very far indeed.

You are correct regarding the divisibility monetary attribute of the protocol, however, my extreme example states that the purchasing power of the smallest unit of measure (e.g. a tiny piece of gold in a world where gold is the only available form of money) would require further divisibility if, and only if, the whole world's goods, services and trade needs to be represented with value in the limited supply of the protocol.  This is obviously extremely unlikely.

South African here.  Great to see some other African people invested in Bitcoin and the idea of freedom.
I concur with what you've said indeed.  I've been reading quite a bit on many of the alt coin designs like MYR/XMR/DRK/VTC etc.  There is an arms race by the alt coin devs to essentially encapsulate the ideals you've summarized.  Ring signatures, transaction mixing, stealth addresses etc for anonymity, multiple alternative algorithms (POW/POS &amp; mixes of mining algs like MYR's).  
If we can get these type innovations systematically incorporated into the BTC blockchain of Bitcoin it would be super awesome.  BTC developers need to hurry while the ecosystem is still relatively small and nimble enough before it explodes into a true alternative monetary financial system as we all hope it will become.
In the meantime, although I am an idealist, a am trying to be prudent and diversify into some of the alt coins just in case..
Many other people are following suit because they are fearing the FUD in r/Bitcoin.

Well put.  Makes me think of this quote:
"At any rate, the spook spoke the truth: cryptology represents the future of privacy, and more. By implication cryptology also represents the future of money, and the future of banking and finance. (By "money" I mean the medium of exchange, the institutional mechanisms for making transactions, whether by cash, check, debit card or other electronic transfer.) Given the choice between intersecting with a monetary system that leaves a detailed electronic trail of all one's financial activities, and a parallel system that ensures anonymity and privacy, people will opt for the latter. Moreover, they will demand the latter, because the current monetary system is being turned into the principal instrument of surveillance and control by tyrannical elements in Western governments." - J.

Interesting network effect we are witnessing here and we can maybe all learn from this..
I think Dogecoin's 'hyperinflation' effect is a fantastic parable in a petri dish like experiment of how the USD and other fiat currencies might make people eventually flee for a more reliable store of value.  In this case the timeline was just very short because the crypto currency network is small and has less inertia compared to the fiat-debt-based-money-octopus swallowing the globe.

That is true i.e. Bitcoin's neutrality towards any ideolodgy. What I see as a need is to send every coin through a mixing service as soon as it comes out of that robot.  At least if you value your liberty and anonymity.  If you want big brother to keep tabs on you, by all means, maybe include another transaction fee as a default for tax purposes while you're going through step 666.

The protocol's algorithm does it automatically by design i.e. the new coins are released and awarded to the miners based on their contribution of securing transactions.

Actually, I think it is a typical mainstream saying from people that are generally very risk averse.  These days there are very few middle class people that can 'afford' to lose any more they earn anyway.  They are being squashed by the fiat tax system and inflation from all sides.  I would rather see this phrase being applied to gambling than investing in Bitcoin.  
The risk not to invest is also worth considering.  Hard to quantify the upside but the potential upside far outweigh the potential downside.  One could rationally apply Pascal's wager to investing in Bitcoin.

If you price oil (read energy) in gold and not in fiat dollars, I would argue with Mike Maloney that gold is a stable store of value.  You also need to account for price manipulations by central banksters.
On expanding the monetary base I would argue that the recent bond purchases by the Fed has been totally out of proportion with the economic growth.  Inflation is now a hidden time bomb for the dollar.

Without a unified fiscal policy it was doomed to fail since its inception.  Hopefully Bitcoin could at the very least challenge humanity's perception of how money can be managed.
I personally hope Bitcoin eats away at the foundations of this fiat-central-banking USD/EUR/CNY/YEN... virus that allows politicians and bankers to get the average citizen indebted for the better part of their lives. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:35:03
..technically it has the same effect i.e. more available supply of numbers between the max and min levels of the protocol.  It will be more related to the miner's minimum fee.  If it gets to a min of 1 Satoshi per transaction and that 1 Satoshi can buy you a car, then we have to increase the decimal places.

Sadly all the bitcoins in circulation won't be enough to defend Edward against the corrupt US legal system.

I think many bitcoiners (myself included) are worried about their personal information indefinitely being traceable (NSA anyone?) once an ounce of info has been entrusted with a third party service provider, hence the community's uproar about these terms.  
It is pretty hard to regain full anonymity once information in the blockchain becomes public knowledge, whether intentionally or unintentionally via a trusted third party like these centralized exchanges.

thats a good way to normalise market caps relative to a common unit e.g. usd 
the interesting psychological implication for market pricing would still be the relative scarcity.  btc might eat fiat at an ever increasing rate because of the price signal feedback loop.  all fiat currencies keep inflating to try and promote national exports while bitcoin would be immune and effectively deflationary in a sea of fiat

CB is fucking up the ecosystem for all of us in the long run with their support of steps to undermine the fungibility properties of the protocol that is already not great to begin with.

@_date: 2015-08-27 13:52:37
TL;DR, Yes.
Access to cheap money leads to asset bubbles, i.e. misallocation of capital and overvalued assets like stocks and real estate.  
We can already see the re-valuation of the overvalued stock markets starting to show in the news lately e.g. China because they built cities where no one can afford to live. 
People think they are rich by owning overvalued paper assets but when the interest rates rise they are over-leveraged and start to default on mortgages and credit card debt.   Panic selling starts and markets collapse.
Governments also need to print more and more money to finance public projects because tax income is not enough and they try to stimulate exports with weaker currencies.  Devaluation of fiat currencies effectively becomes a global race to the bottom.   Government bonds don’t return a positive ROI and people start fleeing from the currency as a store of value and hyperinflation hits.

@_date: 2018-03-06 09:20:08
Thats why I support xmr because there is zero compromise on the most important attribute of sound money i.e. fungibility.
Given the silly scaling disputes and how easy many of the B2X supporters were to start compromising long term values for short term advancements, it became evident that bitcoin's fundamental privacy enhancement to make privacy THE default at an atomic level would require an even more controversial hard fork. Given the ridiculous push for SegWit 2X from the businesses which benefit from incresed transaction troughput, can you imagine the pro- vs anti KYC/AML fights they will try impose on the cypherpunk's invention?
Hence xmr. Give to them (the fiat establishment) zero, but take from them: Everything!
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:39:00
The point is that the regulators will make it your problem if you have used any type of mixing service to prove that you are not a money launderer. The onus would be on the bitcoin user to disprove a regulator's default claim that he/she has not funded something illegal or got the money from illicit activities.  That is how KYC rules work today.
It will be great it the courts rely on reasonable doubt to be on the onus of the regulators to prove.  That way we could win.. not the other way round which is what bitcoin is today.
Bitcoin could become an Orwellian nightmare instead of a liberating financial technology.  We should not rely on the users to achieve their own anonymity.  The protocol should do that as the default.
Storing value in a public ledger is horrible for privacy.  An opague ledger like monero would suck a lot of value into it if bitcoin cant compete.  It is already starting to accelerate because the vast majority of xmr users are proper cypherpunks not wanting to crypto to buy coffee.

xmr have plans to scale with 2nd layers like all blockchains.  On chain scaling is just impossible for global financial databases.
The problem that bitcoiners will have in future is to justify to regulators why they have used anonomizing techniques like xmr.to. 
The users should not be put in such a compromising position in the first place.  Bitcoin has an immense weakness on this point.  The sooner it is acknowledged rather than deferred, the quicker we can fix it.

There can only be one solution if we dont want to risk a fork. 1MB is staying because of a lot of ideological visionaries on core's side, so if SegWit2x gets too much support there will definitely be a fork.  The risk is worse than BCash this time.  No replay protection will cause havoc.

Honest question.. what is the benefit of an id on a permissionless blockchain (like btc) where you explicitly dont need an ID to transact?  
Is is a wise idea to super impose an identity system on top of a currency protocol that is supposed to be fungible?
i.e. you dont need to care who pays you because you dont have to trust someone (/something) that is passing you the bearer instrument (token) through the network (i.e. blockchain).

Yes. Time to orphan Bitpay from the community by commercial consensus.  It is cancer to the btc protocol anyways.  The time has come for those on the sideline of the btc/bch debate to pick a side based on principles and stick to it. btc has won. Lets move on.

Yawn.  Your market moved on to Samourai while you guys ran an ICO and appeased BCH pumpers.

To adopt bitcoin on such a national scale it would be useful if a lot of tech savvy guys spin up Lightning nodes on Raspberry PIs and train people on how to download a wallet and connect to a couple of their nodes to form a self helping community

@_date: 2018-04-15 19:58:09
thx for a great clarification. Agreed.
It will be interesting to see what could happen if enough people embraces bitcoin instead of another form of fiat. It is probably too early IRL though.  
I heard news stories of the gov bullying miners in Venezuela already. It will be unlikely for the majority of people to openly defy the gov by trading good and services for btc in fear of retaliation but when one has to feed your kids it becomes an alternative to survive in the chaos.
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:28:18

blockchain aka DLT for banks
Nothing related to crypto.  Consensus is still by government decree i.e. fiat.  
All bullshit, they are just stealing cool nerdy tech words from the internet for peddaling their shitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-07 20:01:34
People are passionately and ideologically opposed to other people misrepresenting their interests. That is why not having replay protection on SegWit2X is analogous to misquoting some else's words in another context (i.e. adding their transactions to another ledger).
Since free speech is becoming indistinguishable from money when using bitcoin, people have a financial incentive to be protective of their 'speech' when signing transactions. 
It becomes highly philosophical in our social experiment of redefining money.
The NYAers will find out the hard way that they can't stuff around with the cypherpunks' speech and money without pissing off their honey badger.   
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:02:33
how people cant hate banks is beyond me
@_date: 2018-07-29 07:49:11
This is heartbreaking and exactly the motivation we need.  Thx for sharing. 
Too bad that the likelihood of this happening again keeps increasing every year in fiat as government deficits and QE continues globally.  Next time the contagion might not be ring fenced to one small country as Cyprus.
We need to keep preparing to hedge against this risk with Bitcoin. If bitcoin gets adopted by at least a proportion of society we could at least prevent total hyperinflationary catastrophes like Venezuela et al 
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:56:09
pls elaborate with specifics
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:31:24
it is understandable, although not scalable.  
It could make for an interesting experiment to adopt LN to minimize transaction fees lost to miners.  Since it is inevitable to rebuild trust in a new MOE, hopefully LN can be just in time to the rescue
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:51:22

@_date: 2018-04-15 17:44:50
Their effective currency is.. potatoes.  That is pure desperation.
When hyperinflation and effectively non functional government forces a reset the MOE it is a golden opportunity for a grassroots level adoption of an alternative.  Zimbabweans did it (our neighbors here in South Africa) by effectively adopting the ZAR and USD as alternatives without approval from their useless leaders.

it is terrible for fungibility and freedom from violent self appointed policemen in the space; fuck them, come see what we do at monero. We dont tolerate stuff like this; even Bitmain is getting the boot from the community.

Yes, hence xmr has a major fungibility advantage but many of the additional features for btc are being worked on like bulletproofs, shnorr sigs, taproot etc.  LN nodes and routing also adds a major increase in the ability to multi-hops behind Tor/I2P that will make it impossible to proof where funds originated.
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:48:06

This is a fantastic service and the .to domain adds an extra layer of "good luck regulators" as a feature.  
xmr could be a great complimentary coin to btc for maintaining financial privacy and these type of services are a great example.  
Great work guys.
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:02:16
