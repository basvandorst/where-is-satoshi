Me too! You know, I’ve been thinking to myself recently when people say “well bitcoin is not really a currency but it’s a great store of value” I keep thinking - it certainly used to be. It’s only this year I’ve become aware of it as a store of value and been so glued to the price. I wouldn’t have held any back in the day in fact I bought them just to spend them.

Yeah I had to sell mine recently to pay an emergency expense. Feel your pain.

Or go for the lotto and spend it all on bitcoin in 2009

I was just saying that for comedic effect to be fair, I have no bloody idea which bit is poor and which is not

Precisely what I think. It makes no sense to me at all

Yeah I’m slightly miffed the price has shot up literally a few days before I get paid to be honest

There is no option but to HODL if you foolishly bought in significantly when the price was high. Fuck losing all that money. We know it will go up again, why would you sell at a loss?

I’m not mad that bitcoin is crashing, I’m just mad I bought at what thought was the bottom of the dip but wasn’t

Coinspot! Easier to verify for Pom like me too. Uses POLi but you can use Bpay too to deposit.

To be fair at this point you could probably buy land in Northern Spain with potatoes

For years I've missed out on buying coins - I've even got some in cold storage somewhere I don't even know. PLease can someone tell me - should i buy now and hold out for that beautiful 10k? Am i stupid not to have anything invested? Should I buy now or wait?

that must hurt. my worst is putting a load of coins in a silkroadesque site's wallet whilst stoned and forgetting which one.

Same thing with me. It's like not playing the lottery the one week where your numbers come up
