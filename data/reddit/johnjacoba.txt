It is good for bitcoin. Having the option for futures is good because you can hedge risk, allowing more serious companies to join in, which in the long term would increase its credibility.

Some years ago, this was like utopian forecast. GJ, keep it going.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:38:39
This is an absolute must. This is happening now and whether conservators like it or not it is blooming.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:27:23
Good job. Private interests pretending to be something else, have nothing to do among us.
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:47:51
Ofcouse it is not backed, have in mind that 97% of the money currently in circulation are loaned, how could non-existent surplus be backed by anything?

You are gambling into a revolutionary trend technology.

bitcoin.com is just hijacked domain. People seeking from from other people's work. Nothing more nothing less.

Its like looking at any other tech diagram. I get little out of it, but its one big awe for people who understand it.
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:03:45
Is your mother aware of you being around?
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:02:56
Its really stable. there was a huge rise during the Fall.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:46:58
This is rather unfortunate, hers a business idea for people to conduct business on wall street buy printing wallets on paper. It would be a blast.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:13:04
Absolutely correct. If you are running away from somebody you need to really get away from him, not go the other way around.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:01:31
Haha its a lot more than just a typing mistake, but yeah it began as such.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:05:02
Its a state of the mind, never let an investment become passionate. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:36:20
I actually found a job thanks to crypto currencies in general. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:29:13
We are growing against all odds and forecasts. There were hyper-optimized predictions that it would reach 10k by  the end of 2017, and now we are at 14k with 3 weeks left. Wow.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:47:52
Wow if this is real, that's quite a bit of scandal material right here.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:12:14
Well if you have such leverage of owning enough to be a factor, you are equally influential as a central control unit is. We may only hope that those people are altruistic enough not to fuck us up, but I doubt it. Whenever there is something to be gained, someone finds the most efficient way to gain it.

Worry should always be on the table. It simply guarantees that people are always precautious, which on its on behalf serves as a preventer from most harm.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:52:02
Now is the time for you to buy a second garage!
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:51:07
Usually there is tendency for the node to drop within two weeks if it hasn't passed by then. In general - yes it should.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:17:28
Pump and dump everybody, that's what it is. It is only an opportunity to buy more ETH for me but others may read it in different ways.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:38:10
Its like the universal lottery ticket, just wait before it no longer is. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:39:38
This guy knows where to HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:34:52
Lets face it, what really happened?
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:51:56
I sold a bike, an old endure KTM, for 5 bitcoin some time back. I was not even running, It needed new spark plugs etc. I saved those bitcoins as I didn't really need them, It was more of a joke, and getting rid of an almost impossible to sell bike. last week It happened that I had sold my bike for well over 50 thousand dollars. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:56:30
Indeed, we nee more quality memes people. Forget about the price dropping due to it, its something more, there is something spiritual about it.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:44:34
A commodity with an every growing potential of becoming a universal currency?  
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:03:03
It is not that we didn't know it, but I interesting to see that Bitcoin has the ability to recover from a downfall in a matter of months, where the regulated economy might take years.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:40:20
Rather interesting, I can only see more government regulations to come into the picture, the bigger btc gets.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:05:10
I myself want one of these in my neighborhood. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:20:14
That's rather nice, I come from a part of Europe where crypto currencies are a geeky topic in general, which is sad. But seeing more and more companies trying spread bitcoin across Europe is very cool.
 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:30:55
That would be hilarious. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:13:26
It is really hard to account it since the prices are very volatile. If you feel like it you could account it just as you would using the current price. But even if you don't , it is hard to track your income, having in mind it is a decentralized crypto currency, which works more like a commodity. Funny times, bound to become even funnier.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:01:20
Oh that's cool. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:22:16
I see your reasoning, but I still haven't bought into litecoin, I don't know whether I ever will. I just don't feel confident enough about. I have some ETH by the way but that is all because I am interested in some ICOs.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:53:15
Awesome, I am waiting for you to start. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:06:21
What I would do is, invest half of the money planed to go to bitcoin now, wait for the dip right after the  fork, and  then buy with the other half.(the reason I believe that there is going to be a dip, is because of many people forecasting big sales right after the fork.)
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:05:00
Not only on thanks giving, I found it hilarious when a waitress friend of mine told me that she doesn't understand anything about it yes she thinks it is a scam. After a long talk she bought into it.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:50:50
Just a brief example to you, of what the tulip maket lacked  that bitcoin has and is developing. 
 
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:56:59
I saw it coming like 2-3 days ago, when posts started emerging that were aiming at boosting prices of bcash. I think the reason for that is to artificially boost prices so that any miners who were involved could step out with a slight margin, instead of loss.

"Currency is a generally accepted form of money, including coins and paper notes, which is issued by a government and circulated within an economy. Used as a medium of exchange for goods and services, currency is the basis for trade." 
The only thing it lacks for me is the lack of centralization, which is what makes it so appealing, which adds a feature to bitcoin, which the fiat currencies lack - demand for it.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:44:09
Indeed. Not only that, but more convenience is being brought to the equation.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:57:46
Lol, some people might be even crying a bit in the middle of a party nowadays. In fact I'm surprised they even went there in the first place.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:40:21
Ofcourse they are, they have been underestimating Bitcoin ever since the beginning.
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:53:31
Of course it is, I have been seeing such diagrams ever since the beginning. It is just a tool used to sow doubt in people, whether or not there is a benefit to reap out of that, I am not sure, but it is apparent what the reason is.
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:50:35
Unfortunately some people just follow the flow, which leading them directly to the big greedy mouths of those darn whales.
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:41:01
The only risk associated directly is the probability to not break even due to high electricity bills. Other than that I see no gamble, but I would like to hear if someone has anything more to add.
