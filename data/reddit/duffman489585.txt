Everyone goes on and on about how BTC is better because it's inflation free, but that's never really made complete sense. You don't create money with a printing press, you create it with fractional reserve banking. BTC is a little better, but not entirely immune.   
  
I don't see any reason why a bank can't have and loan BTC like they do with cash. This happens all the time with exchanges already. It's exactly analogous. I can offline/withdraw my BTC/USD and put it in a paper wallet/ glass jar but I don't know that it's going to be safer than in an exchange/bank. Because of this my exchange/bank can claim to have more BTC/USD than they actually have and use it in hopes that I don't offline/withdraw it. Ideally the BTC community / Fed keeps exchanges/banks from not running with too low of a reserve but sometimes they don't.  
  
I like BTC because it's fungibility as an intermediary, not so much it's other interesting aspects. Assuming you're a working class US citizen such as myself printing more money is kind of a good thing within reason, it's almost the exact opposite of trickle down economics. Imagine a stock split where the house keeps the new stock. You've essentially transferred value from everyone holding cash reserves to whoever is receiving the benefit of the printing, typically loans. If you're in debt more than the cash in your checking account, like most of us, that can be a good thing. If you're overseas holding USD, or holding a large amount of cash reserves... sucks to be you.

This is also not strictly enforced. Many items listed for foreigners are in USD/EUR. The banks are also regularly out of both because of the demand for not-Hryvnia due to massive inflation. Its really a pretty good climate for BTC, but it has very very little visibility there. I'm really surprised officials issued any statements on it at all considering.

They likely would only direct deposit to a local account with its associated fees. Then he would have to transfer to a foreign account with huge fees sending and receiving. This solution sounds like he's currently **making** 5% margin...  I have no idea what his holdings are valued in, so there could be potentially zero BTC associated speculative risk.

I think it might be more a feature than a bug. It's sort of analogous to asking people to mail you cash. If you move some people might think you have the same address, but the alternative is letting every postman along the way have the authority to open your mail.  
  
The alternative is to somehow implement use of a 'trusted' 3rd party, like a bank. Not that it's necessarily a bad idea to have a bank account denominated in BTC.

Why are we not talking about the real existentialist threat to democracy in the US?  
  
When the US intelligence community is trying to collect blackmail material on every future political leader, that is an almost textbook definition of a coup d'etat. It makes you wonder about the success of the operation when the only treason charges being discussed are for the people exposing it.

I'd be surprised in that they were doing it again:  
  
CIA kidnapped americans for experimentation, killing a number in the process. Congress formed the Church committee after they were found out. There was much accountability, hands were wrung and wrists were slapped. Eventually President Ford signed an executive order saying they extra promised that it would probably never happen again.  
    
"Experiments on humans were intended to identify and develop drugs and procedures to be used in interrogations and torture, in order to weaken the individual to force confessions..."   
  
"... mental patients, prisoners, drug addicts and prostitutes, "people who could not fight back," as one agency officer put it."

The point is to normalize the idea of arresting people for what they write on Twitter. It's what these people do because they think they're helping the same way they thought they were helping in Jonestown. Spain even got in on the action fining people for posting pictures of police misconduct. It's pretty standard shit.

"Rise" of the police state? We're currently the world's leading police state, our numbers would make Stalin blush. We have the most prisoners per capita of any nation by a **WIDE** margin, 25% of the world's total (with only 4% of the population). We have more prisoners than China, even just by bulk number, and we don't have more of anything than China.

I think BTC is a very interesting technology that appears to be instrumental in facilitating commerce, particularly internationally and in the developing world. There are some arguments to be made for it possibly bringing stability to some developing countries.  
  
That's a long distance from arguing a return to fixed money supply for the Euro or Dollar though. I'm somewhat inclined to agree though, my concern is investment. If you have a slightly inflationary currency I believe it effects the investing class more than the working class. I'm worried that a deflationary currency would encourage a permanent investment class where people just sit and live off of their savings without contributing to society. In that way I see inflation as almost an inescapable redistribution of all stores of just stuck currency. I could see the counter argument that it could be seen as a regressive flat tax though.

Its all 'shuffling money around'. As of Q2 of 2012 there were significantly more exports than imports, no?
@_date: 2015-03-12 00:30:28
Yes and we'll mandate that all money be distributed evenly to the cent at all times. Then if we need more stuff we'll just print the money to buy it. Do you ever wonder why there's the number of euros or dollars that there are? Why there's not half as many or twice as much? Since we don't have the gold standard anymore for better or worse policy makers have to decide that number. If you don't like their policies you can come up with your own and see if people will support it.   
  
China held their currency low to support exports too. Yes it hurts other areas of the economy. Where is that optimal spot? I don't know. I suspect they're moving in the correct direction. Can you tell me specifically why that optimal is in the other direction?

For the world no. But for Europe there could be a net gain depending on how much of their economy is exports. No?
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:09:18
I don't know why you're getting so many downvotes other than the angry type. It does make sense a bit why they're doing it, and it is very similar to the strategy the Chinese were so strongly criticized for.  
  
It increases exports which in turn increases jobs which Europe desperately needs. The downside is it limits imports and domestic purchasing power, it also cuts in at entitlements as kind of a back door austerity. I guess we'll see if it pays off.  
  
Unless someone wants to explain why I'm wrong?

This one is the most confusing to me. As an average person I wouldn't mind paying a few dollars for porn if it was higher quality than the free stuff. The barriers to market entry aren't price, but rather the billing and obvious privacy concerns. Its the same reason the internet became more popular, because people would rather download in the privacy of their home rather than go to some video store in the sketch part of town in the family car.      
  
I'm confused how btc hasn't had more popularity in that market?
@_date: 2015-02-25 17:02:20
Thanks, this does make sense. I guess it's unfortunate that more people don't have VPNs. Maybe this is an area we can look at for growth as the market expands beyond btc being just for remittance, online drugs, and porn tokens.
