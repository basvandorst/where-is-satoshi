One of the articles I am talking about is  . The article is behind a paywall, but the translation of title and abstract are:
"Virtual fortune
The digital currency Bitcoin is a digital version of cash, which is not supervised by a central bank, but by math. The system offers good prerequisites for micropayments and anonymous payments. However, it challenges criminal prosecution institutions as much as  the established business models of banks"
It is really hard to translate this accurately. The word 'eingefahren', which I had to translate by 'established' for example has a very negative connotation in German.
So you see, the main focus is on 'no central bank'. As much as I remember the article (I might be mixing up some of these statements with later articles from the same magazine though, obviously 5 years later this is hard to remember), the focus is on absolute predictability. You  can see in the preview pictures that they even show a graph of the future money supply. They bring up the scalability issue, though not the possible routes out of it.
And they very clearly say that if you wanted to mine, you are already way too late for that. A claim that I luckily did not believe ;-) 
No central bank means no steering. No steering means you have to stick by the rules that are set from the beginning. You must not change those rules (read to the end, I will limit this claim later). There are several rules on Bitcoin that I do not think are the best choice.
Limiting the number of Bitcoin is one of them. I just don't think that Bitcoin needs to be deflationary. For the purpose of not being centrally planned The security will always depend on the total (including fees) block reward. When the block reward diminishes, in the deflationary choice the security has to be paid by transactions, in the inflationary case (e.g. going to constant 1% increase in coins per year) the security is paid by the hodlers. I think the latter would be preferable. I DON'T SUGGEST TO CHANGE THAT!
I think the blocksize limit at 1MB is a bad choice. As a ddos prevention, it would have been sufficient to put a limit into the propagation network instead of the consensus code. This is quite similar to what Bitcoin unlimited is trying to do. I like this idea and if I would design a currency now, this is probably what I would do. BUT I DON'T SUGGEST TO CHANGE THE RULES!
The rules might not be perfect. And most of all, whether you consider the rules perfect or what you would change depends on your political views and your particular usecase. People talk about some sort of social contract and the spirit of it and want to change the Nakamoto consensus rules to adhere to this contract. They say that sticking by the current Nakamoto consensus rules is 'changing' Bitcoin. The problem is, a 'social contract' is subject to interpretation. Your interpretation includes that you don't want a 'fee event'. A currency which rules are subject to interpretation is something we already have. It is the USD, EUR, GBP, CNY. I don't see value in creating one more. The only way to maintain the perfect predictability is to not have change in rules. Period.
So what does that leave us with. Bitcoin is probably our only attempt to establish a cryptocurrency (listen to Andreas Antonopolus talking about "Bitcoin Maximalism" on LetsTalkBitcoin for a reference for this claim) and it is broken. It does not scale. This is a problem.
My humble suggestion and hope is the following. Some rules will need to change and will need to be adaptable later. Adding more OP_codes to create new possibilities for signatures is one of them. And I _do_ want to change the blocksize, because not doing this is a blocker to the project.
I hope that segwit will introduce this separation. First introduce segwit and see that it works and addresses all the issues. Then, a few month later, do one hardfork. With this hardfork, bump the version to 1.00 and make clear that there will never be a second hardfork. Ever. With this, it is clear that the transaction data part will never change again. The witness part on the other hand is what stays softfork upgradable and it seems to me that this gives all the possibilities that one will ever need to introduce Snarks, Schnorr signatures, you name it. At the same time, this hard fork will have the chance to clean up behind the softfork implementation of segwit and make the blocksize limit infinite. Either instantly or by some transparent plan for the future or by FlexCap, you name it, I don't care too much.
That is the Bitcoin I am hoping for.
PS: In line of a constructive discussion I probably should drop this at this point, but I _do_ have some dignity. Accusing me of "undisprovable generalisations" before the fact and at the same time being guilty of just that by suggesting that _everyone_ is on your side of the argument by referring to a vision that "we all sogned up for" is quite bold.

Every miner can choose whatever transactions he wishes to take. There are no hard-set rules and there can not exist any since they would be completely unenforceable for technical reasons (the mempool of the miner at the time he assembles the block can not be known, and if you can not know if the miner knew of a transaction, you can not expect it to be in the block).
There are some default settings in the node software, which reserved a certain number of transactions per block for high-priority transactions regardless of their fee. I am not sure if these defaults are still in place, but even if they are, since mining pools are large-scale operations, you would expect the operators to not necessarily care for the defaults but write their own rules. And those rules will most likely be to just take the most profitable transactions.
The devs can not do more than just suggesting these selection criterions, only the miners decide which transactions they ultimately take.
As an off-topic side-node: The same is true for the 'discount' on witness data of SegWit transactions. Nobody can force miners to grant this discount, they will eventually write their own rules that reflect their own pursuit of profit. Chance is though that they will go with the suggested discount for a while.

And about "opt-in" RBF, one last time before I get tired of answering that in various channels: Choosing transactions into a block is _not_ part of the consensus rules. Not at all. Has never been, could never been.
The reason is simple. For it to be part of the consensus rules a node would have to be able to say for sure if the miner chose the 'correct' transactions into a block. For which he would have to know which transactions the miner knew about at the time of building the block. Which is clearly impossible. If it were possible to know this, that alone would be sufficient to prevent double spends and we would not need proof of work to begin with.
Thus, accepting zero confirmation transactions was _always_ broken, as Peter Todd proved in a rather impressive way against Coinbase. With a few lines of python.
What replace by fee does is actually making explicit what has been possible implicitly all along. This is a repaired version of something that Mike Hearns tried to do when he put propagation of double spends into Bitcoin XT. _That_ was a stupid idea (your opinion might vary), opt-in RBF is the same thing in clever.
And to state this as clear as possible: RBF is no fork of any type. Neither soft, nor hard, nor something else. Because it does not touch the consensus rules in any way at all.,

I am not sure. Essentially, LN is a hubs and spokes model, very much like Ripple. The difference is that with a traditional hubs and spokes model you have to trust your hub. LN removes this trust by making the funds at your hub blockchain enforceable, which at the same time removes the centralization incentives that e.g. Ripple has. A Citigroup-USD on Ripple is probably worth more than a Your-Shady-Neighbor-USD, because you have more (not much, but more) trust in Citigroup to exchange your IOU for an actual physical dollar. Since you don't need trust in LN, your shady neighbor might very well be your hub. Which is also why LN is not called a hubs and spokes system, because this name implies few hubs and many spokes. This is (hopefully) not the case for LN.
But network-wise it is very similar. So if Ripple can do transactions between different asset classes trustlessly (apart from the trust to your hub), then why not LN?
This is all very exciting. If it turns out that by chance LN also happens to be a perfect decentralized exchange, this would be hilarious. And valuable. But mostly hilarious.
I am definitely the wrong guy to talk to though, I am just connecting dots between claims that I gathered mostly from podcasts floating around. I might be totally wrong.

Yes, I disagree with classic's hardfork. The idea of 2MB hardfork before is incompatible with doing only one hardfork at all in Bitcoins lifetime. And yes, I do think that Core has the right mindset to pull off what I hope for. For that it is sufficient to look e.g. at their suggested sponsorship proposals ( Point 3, figure out how to make hardfork safely. Point 4, flexcap.
Flexcap is a proposal for blocksize adjustments which are in principle unbound but give incentives to miners to keep it small, thus creating an equilibrium ( A lot of research will have to go there to see if this really works in the long run, but this is the type of fork that does not require a second fork the year after. No 'kick the can down the road'.
With all this praising for core, I should make the point that the node that I run is _not_ a core node. I run btcd.
As for "bitcoin will always be able to fork" just with sufficient miner support, I guess right now is the time where it will be decided if this will be possible or not. Even 95% miner consensus will not be able to fork if the economy and community don't go along. Otherwise Bitcoin would not be sustainable.
Basically there are two ways that a cryptocurrency can be governed. Either you set the rules and declare them fixed for ever. In that case if your rules turn out to not work in the long run, your currency dies and you lost. Or you declare the currency subject to frequent changes and continuous development. Ethereum uses this option and Monero even goes further and announces that there will be scheduled hardforks every 6 months. I am very skeptical that such a currency can be censorship resistant. Sure, there are a lot of altcoins that do this currently and it works fine for them. But that's because those are not in the focus of regulators (yet). If a regulator realizes that lobbying can change the consensus rules, this is an attack vector.
The mentioned altcoins for example, Ethereum and Monero both have in common that they have a leader. Without a leader it would be much harder to form the consensus for consensus changes, but with a leader, there is an attack point.
I think Bitcoin (and thus cryptocurrency in general, again listen to Andreas Antonopolous talking about Bitcoin Maximalism for a reference) only has a chance with the first model. Don't change rules.
It would have been much nicer if Satoshi would have stayed around, enabling steering decisions until those are not necessary anymore. If he'd have removed the blocksize limit before he left. He did not. Gavin talking to the CIA made him leave too early.
So here we are, trying to get Bitcoin out of beta. Making decisions about changes and at the same time asserting to the world that Bitcoin's rules are unchangeable.
This is difficult enough as it is, even without a faction demanding that we do a hardfork for which everybody knows it would last for one year max. In order to -and this is what also important proponents actually ask for- 'practice' hardforks. To demonstrate that Bitcoin can adapt.
Why would we want that?

Right, they are not fully validating as in party C sends to party D but to A (our outdated node) it looks like the money is lying on the table for everyone to grab. If party E would take it, A would not oppose this.
That's true so far. So if A is a miner, blockexplorer or such, he should upgrade.
What is often suggested here and in the other subs though is that A would lose security. This is false. If B wants to pay money to A, he would ask A for an address. A, not knowing anything about segwit, would give B a usual Bitcoin address to send the funds to and B would do so, not being allowed to take the advantages of segwit. That's the important point.
A decides if the funds are being send using segwit. Not B.
A's funds are never at danger. So if A runs a node to do his own business, he does not suffer from any loss of security. It would just seem weird to A that there are piles of money lying on the table free for everyone to take but nobody does. And _if_ somebody does, there is a invisible (to A) force slapping the thief and forbidding it. A would not understand why those funds can not be taken, but hey, A does not have any connection to these funds to begin with. Hey does not care if they can be taken or not. A understands all that happens with his own funds of funds that are send to him.
Here is the only possible attack vector: B asks A for an address to send funds to. A gives a traditional address and B. B guesses that A does not understand segwit. So B waits until a block is mined by a miner who also does not understand segwit (less than 5% by activation, probably closer to 0%) creates a block that obeys the 'can be spend by anyone' rule and ignores the attached segwit rule. This block will be orphaned by &gt;95% of the miners. At precisely this point, B builds a block himself or pays a miner to build a block on top of this to be orphaned block. Everyone knows it is about to be orphaned but A. This block would then include the transaction from B to A. A hands over the coffee and B runs away, desperately trying to double spend the input. He gets a slight edge because he knows that the parent of the block including his transactions will be orphaned, while A does not.
Cost of attack (independent of success): two block rewards. Maybe only one if B is lucky enough to see the first block in the wild.
Possible gain: one coffee.
Probability of success: Probability of randomly seeing a to be orphaned block in the wild times his own share of the total hashrate.
tl;dr: You might not understand some of the stuff that you see happening around you, but your own money and funds you receive are perfectly safe.

Since nobody knows which side of the fork will fail, I for one (and probably the vast majority of people) will not move any funds around starting a few days before the fork and ending a few weeks after a clear winner arose.
_This_ can kill bitcoin. The complete halt of spending over a prolonged time. And the funny thing is: since there will be no transactions, there won't be a &gt;1MB block for quite some time (until someone proposes a stresstest ;-) ) which prolongs the time I (and others) will hold back transactions. That's the danger of a fork. If I could go back in time to change the blocksize, I probably would. But this issue is not worth to risk the economy as a whole over.

Which continent did this even happen on? That you did not even bother to tell means it's probably USA, but since most likely local law applies, the post is useless at it is.

@_date: 2014-07-02 09:01:18
And to nevertheless give my opinion on this, while Bitcoin is international I do not see a problem to let communities (regional or web) choose their own denominator. A webforum for trading panini soccer stickers might use uBTC, a antique market in switzerland might use BTC and a supermarket might use mBTC. No harm done as long as you use unambiguous denominators. The real pain ONLY starts if you come up with your own name like 'bit'.

technical adaption is currently slower than progression in price (despite the current downtrend). Once devices hit the market that can sign transactions without themselves having access to the network, this will not be an issue anymore.
Of course those devices will have to be the size of a credit card.
Bitcoin is far more successfull than is good for this point in time and than could have been anticipated by the inventors. Give it a few more years. I am very bullish for bitcoin but would definitely not recommend it to my mother right now.
That said, if it takes a few bucks to buy a printer to secure the fair amount that I made 2.5 years ago by mining on my single GPU, than that does not really strike me as a major drawback of a technology that I am optimistic to see growing in the upcoming decades when the ease of use (and security) catches up.
There, I did it. I fed the troll. And I am gonna regret it.
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:47:00
Yes, I would. And I have argues in favour of that in a very similar thread before.
My point is that "just fork" in case of problems is used way too much in discussions here. A fork followed by ~50% of market participants is an existential threat to bitcoin, nothing to try light-heartedly. Only in case of a extremely broad consensus of all types of participants (miners, merchants, holders, ...) this can work.
Tl;dr: solar flear -&gt; fork, miner strike -&gt; no chance in hell!

"Just browse through the adresses for a few decades and your worries will fade"
You can not search by public key obviously. It is fast to get from a private key to a piblic key but impossible to do it the other way round. Impossible as in: would consume way more energy than has been provided by the sun since it began to glow.
Buzzwords to look up: trapdoor funtion, dyson sphere, asymetric cryptography, private/public key cryptography.
As for directory.io: when you visit page 47264839147, the public keys to the private keys from that page are calculated on the fly. Really quick to do, but storing the public keys for the private keys in a database is 1. impossible to do (look above, dyson sphere) and 2. would be impossible to save even if you could use every at in this universe as one bit of storage and 3. strictly the only way you could possible look up the private key for a given public one.
Statistical physics coined the term "livetime of the universe unlikely". When you want to know if something that is in principle not impossible (like atoms spontaniously arranging to form an egg (not impossible. The reverse process is possible (egg breaking apart) and all equations of mechanics are symmetric under time-inversion)) is possible in practice, you just calculate how lilely it is that it ever happened since the universe came to live. Spoiler: the egg thing never happens, same goes for reuse of bitcoin addresses.

Interesting that net neutrality is such a big topic nowadays but the idea to "pay for better data transfer capacity" (through nodes I mean, of course you already have that on the last mile) seems to be fine for everyone.
Sure, I'd pay for provable encryption, but a discrimination of data packages based on criterions like attached fees or the source/destination of these packages is something which makes a lot of sense when your background is blockchain technology but is heavily frowned upon in the context of net neutrality.

That has been discussed elsewhere already. Depends on the state of bitcoin. At this state: fear, uncertainty, doubt. Just watch merchants drop bitcoin as random payments get revoked.
That's why I used an agency in the example. It is much harder to draw profit from an attack. But to just debase bitcoin, random acts of 51% are the perfect measure.

I know what you mean, I wanted to buy back when (mid 2011), but did not trust the exchanges enough to do so (and for a good reason so obviously (well, had I bought in mid 2011 and withdrawn everything, things would have been fine, but as always, hindsight is 20/20 and my reasoning from that time seems fine in general even in retrospect)). So I only have what I mined at that time with my GPU. Way less than what I would have bought, but still something.

Tough decision. Yes of course I would use BIP38, and retain one copy of the paperwallet with the key written on it in a very safe location. But I also would like to have printouts without key in other locations to be able to spend it. And I would not consider a code that I can remember as safe enough.
However, I was pretty impressed by the recent 'Here is a BIP38 encrypted key, crack it' challanges. Four char ones are still uncracked...
tl;dr Yes, you are right. But if in any way possible I would like to keep the extra safety of an uncompromised image.

In that case you are probably capable of assessing yourself that the list of commands bitcoins scripting language is sufficient to execute verifications for arbitrary signature algorithms, not just ECDSA.
the language features all necessary operations, basically everything a proper language provides, exept for jumps. Even if you took away the "crypto" section if aboves link, bitcoin would be fully functional. You would have to implement the checks yourself using mainly the "flow control" and "arithmetic" commands. The "crypto" section is there for convenience and so that transactions are smaller.
If you had to switch algorithms, you would loose the convenience. That's all. No adding/changing the protocol, no forking.
What I said is that once an alternate algorithm has been individually implemented in each transaction for years, one 'might' consider to add back that convenience by adding such the "crypto" section for that algorithm. That would indeed be a fork. If the thought of that causes you distress, remove that lines from my answer and be assured that no fork is necessary to implement other crypto algorithms and it would be very well possible _right now_!
In a personal note, saying "I am a programmer" as a way to end discussions in your favor only works in a context where it is unlikely that other programmers are around.

Yes, I realize that and won't argue about any consequences of any reputation in the USA. I just don't understand the US culture well enough for that. 
However, a reputation carries through the internet. And I know that I will have a hard time defending Bitcoin here in germany if it is known as a currency that typically buys guns, legal or not. Trade your guns all you want. But please do not propagate Bitcoin in that context. Weapons are despised in most counties outside US. And buying them is illegal because of the wide consens in the population in those countries. I don't know about the US. But having this reputation will pose difficulties for Bitcoin adoption in the rest of the world, which ultimately should be something also you do not want.
So brag to your neighbour all you want about how you bought ammo with bitcoin. Go to your local TV station and and give an interview. I don't care. But the internet (and especially this subreddit) is an intermational place. You don't do international bitcoin adoption a favor associating it with weapons in an international community.

I once wanted a plain black shirt with wrists made to use with cufflings (don't know the english word). No shop had any. I went to several branches of one clothing chain whenever I came along one. Which also included several cities and always asked for one. Never pushy, always just disappointed they did not have one.
A few weeks later they had so many in store and no buyers that I even could get a spare one when they all went on sale.

Sure, I personally would prefer to use mBTC, as I don't like too small denominators. And this might change in the future or depending on the actual use case. Up to this point we agree.
But let me give you just two examples of how confusing this 'slang' bit is:
One is self-explaining and stolen from elsewhere in this thread: 
The other one is a line from  :
"0.001 BTC = 1 mBTC = 1 millibitcoin (also referred to as mbit (pronounced em-bit) or millibit or even bitmill)"
You obviously understand SI-prefixes, so lets have a bit of fun. According to above line, 1mbit is 0.001BTC. According to your slang, 1bit = 0.001mBTC, or 1mBTC=1000bit=1kbit so a newb just searching the web (and bitcoin.it/wiki/FAQ appears pretty early in search results) can conclude that 1mbit=1kbit.

Offline transactions. Development is slow and it will not be of use for your upcoming trip. But this is not a reason againt bitcoin as a 'viable currency'.
Basically, instead of broadcasting the transaction yourself ansld waiting until the payee receives it over the network, you transmit the transaction directly to the payee(*) and he broadcasts it.
(*) Reasonable ways are bluetooth, near field communication, a QR code that he can snap from your mobile phone's screen (not entirely sure about the last one, how vig is a signed transaction? Does it fit into a (big) QR code?)

An alternate marketplace could solve that and people looking into buying apps for bitcoins will find that marketplace. Without that infrastructure, selling apps for bitcoins is a problem.

Like it or not, the wars statement is pretty accurate. One of the greatest theoretical physicists ever (and one of the most unpleasant persons ever at the same time), Richard Feynman, did most of his work in the immediate context of developing the nuclear bomb. I benefit from his achievements in my day to day work (as a PhD-candidate in theoretical physics) without any of my work being in the slightest related to weapons. This is only one example that came to my mind immedately, there are plenty of others.
That said, I would of course trade in the knowledge achieved through Feynman to make those bombs non-existent if it were possible.

It is an example of an off-chain construction.
Some company (yes, the evil word, something centralized) can offer some microtransaction handling off the blockchain. you can withdraw whenever you want (possibly for a fee, but once competition is big enough, there won't be large fees).
The point about bitcoin is that you do not HAVE TO use those services. It might be beneficial (cheaper) for small amounts or for people who do not trust their own sense for security. You would store with such a company roughly an amount that you would have with you in your fiat wallet, you can change these providers.
But you can at any given time opt out and go back to storing anything on your own.

one sidechain for each planet and bitcoin for interplanet transactions. ok, 10 minute blocktime for that interplanet superchain is too short, so things would have to be adapted.
on-planet would be as it is now, changing between that and the global blockchain would be possible and just take longer. people would obviously require higher number of confirmations in the global chain because of a high risk of orphans but then again, interplanet payments are most likely not the impatient-customer-at-starbucks kind of purchases...

It "could bave been done" but it "would not have been done". That's a difference.
Plus, just giving money to scientists does nothing unfortunately. What does the most is setting up a big goal that hundrets of people work on collectively. Otherwise each scientist will improve his own little project and nothing happens.
Don't get me wrong, I am as pacifistic as it gets. Read through my older posts on reddit to see me ranting against guns whenever I see somenoe on here arguing in favour for it. And of course, everyone is happy if the one big goal is to build a spaceship to visit the moon rather than building weapons of mass destruction for a war. But then again, the space race was also driven by the need to demonstrate strength in the cold war.
I am really glad that LHC could be built without an immediate war in mind (despite it being a huge waste of money in my opinion, I could be biased though because it is completely off of my field of work) and I am hopefull for the future, but throughout history scientific advance has come in waves together with war... Or do you really think the quality of steel that we have now would be the same if it was not for the need to build durable swords already early on?

The total force that works on an object is the vectorial sum of all forces working on that body. Newtons zeroth law.
In that sense, a testparticle feels a total gravitational force. While this force is of course not exactly directed towards the center of the earth, it is the same force that the builders of the prison used to align the bars. Using that is just fine. Different moon phases or time of day are negligible.

But people acting like this reddit is purely USA bugs be for a while and after too little sleep this morning I burst it out in this thread while I should have taken a better opportunity elsewhere.
People write stuff like "lost 50k due to scam" and take it for granted that everyone will understand they talk about USD. People write "How does tax on bitcoin work" and in the post it becomes clear implicitly that they are talking about US law.
Many times I feel like a foreigner when posts with local reference state the country except it is US.

The total number for hashrate is not relevant. Thing is it hast to be as high as possible.
If for example some three letter agency decides to 51% attack bitcoin, it has to be as expensive as possible for them to do so. And you can assume that they have good scientists! So if one such agency asks their scientists to come up with a way to generate loads of hashrate, it must not happen that those scientists come up with easy ways to be better and create hashrate faster than what is already on the market. Every idea that any startup has, any improvement that hits the market is an improvement that *is already there* and can not come in to attack bitcoin because it is already considered in the current difficulty level.
That is why bitcoin is designed to have the block rewards are so extremely large in the early phase (that we are still in). The network is save (not talking about pools as a possible threat here) if mining gear producers have to struggle to compete with another and with moor's law.

I have no intention at all to start a discussion about which country is 'number one' and I don't care about calling codes. In fact, I can't remember when was the last time I used a 'telephone' for a international call. Things fade so quickly when a new technology comes along.
I merely point out that this is an international (as in non nation) community, suitable for the international (as in non government) currency. Of course there are things of national importance to be discussed. Local meetings, local tax laws, local businesses, local advertisement. For all of them the right local subreddit is the appropriate place.

Well, there is a common misconception as what bitcoin already can. Bitcoin features a pretty awesome programming language (ok, not touring complete, but enough).
It is common to say "bitcoin uses ECDSA" and you "send money to an address". Both is not the full picture.
Think of it more like that: Each transaction you make is like putting a pile of money on a table and putting a piece of paper on top of it that holds the rules under which this pile of money can be claimed. Almost all piles in existence have pretty similar sounding texts on them. "This money can be spend by whomever is capable of proving that he holds the private ECDSA key to a public key of which the hash is XXX". But there are much much more things that could be written on that piece of paper. Multisig (own n of m keys in that way) or stealth addresses are just two examples. When people came up with stealth addresses there was no need to fork bitcoin, they lie within the possibilities of the script language that bitcoin already has.
And if ECDSA becomes unsecure and a new private public key pair algorithm comes up you would just write that on that piece of paper. Old piles of money would still have the old papers on them but it is possible to move them to a new pile under new rules.
Ok, there are some minor details. Writing the whole set of rules to check keys on that paper is lengthy and it is inefficient to have that on each of the piles (although possible as far as I can see) so it might be a good idea to add a new command to the script language that goes "check the key according to algorithm YYY". For convenience. And adding such a command would be undisputed. But that's about it then.
tl;dr Yes, I know what forking is. I stand by what I said. That's why I put the "modified" in quotation marks.

As I said in my last post, I "don't understand the US culture well enough" to  argue about national sensitivities. Obviously (and understanibly), you do not understand enough about german culture and should draw the same consequences.
I do not own guns because I despise them. Guns are outlawed because the vast majority of my fellow citizens feels the same way. And to answer your side blow to the third reich (oh yes, I am personally terribly sorry for what happened 40 years before I was born), you will find the same contempt for weapons in most other european countries and throughout the world.
Again, all I ask is that if your country has a widespread fetish that you know is repulsive to others, then please leave promoting that fetish out of an international community that gathers online to discuss and promote something else.

Ironically, that might happen. If the fork divides the bitcoin economy in half, one half of merchant following one fork, the other half the other fork (i.e. the unforked blockchain), you could spend bitcoin you had before the fork once in each of the subeconomies.
But what I originally meant was that "forking" is actually changing the rules. And with Bitcoin this can only be done with an overwhelming majority of participants. With central banks that can be done by a few people based on undisclosed criteria.
Hence, forking is evil and should not be proposed if someone just feels like it (e.g. lost money due to mtgox) but be avoided no matter what! 
Tl;dr: Preventing changing the rules is what bitcoin stands for. Forking is changing the rules.

coinforcoffee would help you at the nearest starbucks. Yet, after using them today for the first time I was a little disappointed that they return the leftover credit on the giftcard to your bitcoin wealth by sending it to you via coinbase which forces you to generate a coinbase account if you did not already have one (and they do not tell you before, just that they will send it to you using your email). So I can not recommend them without reservation.

It is all about the amount. 2 years ago I had a full node running on the machine I was mining with, weak passwords and even a ssh server running (for unrelated reasons). Because I did not care. The total worth was nothing. As the worth rises, I get more carefull.
To access my bank account online I have to get my credentials from my safe and have my phone ready. And a PC reasonably safe, yet with online access (which is impossible on its own).
To access my bitcoins from cold storage I need to get my paper wallet from my safe and a PC (or smartphone). An unsecure PC is much less an issue because the address is immediately fully spend, the change goes to a new cold storage address.
It is much easier already now to handle large amounts of bitcoins than large amounts of fiat.
The issue is creation of the paper wallet. But then again I am much more comfortable with having to struggle with that myself than to rely on pieces of paper that some employee of my bank handled before handing it over to the mail.
And when in a short while creation of secure offline addresses becomes mainstream usable easy, than it will be much more secure _and_ much easier than fiat.
Of course I take great effort in securing larger amounts of money. I am much more easy with the small amount that I carry around on a day to day basis (roughly equal parts fiat and BTC).

This questions comes up every once in a while and every time I have the feeling that it is only asked because people think that the core devs have some kind of power like the head of the FED or something.
Lets state it once more: NOONE CAN CHANGE THE PROTOCOL.
Bitcoin core is merely a reference implementation of the protocol. Core devs ensure that there is a program which enables working with the blockchain. No political decisions can be made (although people will jump in to argue about some BIP's. But all this is not the protocol). And bitcoin core being the software run on many machines, it is the core devs responsibility to keep it user friendly and free of bugs and backdoors.
That's it! No benefits, lots of responsibilities. Not a nice job to have...

Sorry, but "1000 bit = 1 mbit" is full retard!
mXYZ is the SI prefix for milliXYZ, meaning 1/1000 of XYZ. You probably mean 1000bit=1kbit.
You really made a point that noone should try to establish new standards who does not know about the existing standards. And like it or not, SI standards are  very  established standards.
Coming up with new words is ok (dumb, yet ok) but inventing new words that have  opposite  meaning of established words...

Shops usually don't have open wifi in germany. The reason is a law called "Störerhaftung", which basically says that if someone uses your internet connection to break a law, you can be held responsible in the same way as you can be held responsible if some kid climbs into your unlocked car while you don't watch, releases the handbreak and causes an accident.

Yes, but if from one day to the next 99% of miners stop working, the next (up to) 2016 blocks will take four years, with a block time of 16 hours. After that the difficulty will adjust, but bitcoin is really not well prepared to a _sudden_ loss in hashrate.

I beg to differ (and I am aware that this is not a popular opinion around here)
The most important merchant right now is overstock. Not (the nominally bigger) Dell who cashes out no matter what and not the hempshop guy or whoever, who keeps BTC but might drop BTC altogether if volatility continues to be an issue.
Overstock implemented the infrastructure to accept bitcoin via coinbase but has a deal with them that they can keep an arbitrary amount as bitcoin. No risk at this point. After that they asked employees and suppliers if they want to be paid in bitcoin and have coinbase keep a corresponding amount unexchanged. That amount might grow if more suppliers and employees decide to accept (part of their) payments in bitcoin.
I don't want merchants to go all in to accepting bitcoin and defaulting in the next dip which will only lead to newspaper articles that are bad for the reputation. I want responsible merchants to slowly gain a relevant benefit from an increasing partition of their own payments in bitcoin. That will motivate other merchants to go the same route.
Plus, I really don't understand the discussion of merchants 'keeping' bitcoin. Do you think amazon 'keeps' USD? No. They pay bills, employers and suppliers. If fiat is lying around at the end of the month they will find new ways to invest. Money is not meant to be 'kept'. The only ones who want this are the ones who just want to get rich from owning money. It should be our goal to slowly replace the fiat that now enables that cycle by bitcoin. And to me overstock's business model seems the most likely to succeed as they pursue a route without risk, without defaulting because of the use of bitcoin.

Bitcoin is what my node considers valid. Your bitcoin might be different from my bitcoin if you decide to deviate and in that case we won't be able to do business with each other. Only if we both decide to make the same change can we do so and go on. That's shit, which makes the safest route in absence of overwhelming agreement between us two (and me and everybody else who wants to deal with me and you and everybody else who wants to deal with you) to just not change the rules.
See how nowhere in that did the hashrate ratio play a role? There are some convenience things that would make it desirable that the vast majority of the hashrate stays with us, but never will any miner decide what is valid.
A minor note: I don't care about names. If some loudly screaming 'news' outlet \*coughbitcoindotcomcough\* wants to take that name and run with it into oblivion, then that's fine with me. Won't change the rules though by which my node decides what is valid.

The article is not the full answer. Unlike hashing functions, plain blurring does not follow an avalanche effect. You do not need to sweep through all possible numbers, you can use a minimization scheme. Or even better maximum entropy image reconstruction as suggested by bryan et al. in 1989.

The size of the mempool is a horrible metric. It is very easy and cheap to manipulate by putting up high numbers of transactions with values and fees right above the spam level, that will never actually cost the money since they will never be confirmed.

From the very site you linked to:
"One thousand (1000) milliBits refers to 1 bitcoin or 1 BTC."
And also if you would read the next sentence aftern the one you quoted above you would realize that the non-SI point "not follow the standard verbatim" critique refers to the use of "milliBit" where "milliBTC" would be appropriate. So 1 milliBit is a "voted for" (as per your reference) shorthand version of 1 milliBTC, which is 1000 bit or 1 kiloBit using the notation you propose.
I hope I made clear how extremely fucked up every use other that SI-prefix plus "BTC" is.
And no, I would not call you retard and did not do so. It is a quote from a pretty awesome movie and in that context refers to someone saying something stupid. And yes, you said something stupid. It is not a claim about you in general.

You chose one half of a sentence that is unimportant to my post (indicated by the delimeters) instead of answering to my points? Ok, lets leave it there.
I explicitly acknowledged the fact that the world came together to collectively work on a scientific project and I am aware that each big project produces large amounts of side projects that can be even more important. But there a many possible projects of a comparable size and I am simply not interested wether or not the Higgs Boson exists. I would have prefered a different route.
And no, I did not say war is good. But I won't refrain from using Feynmans theorems for the benefit of my work because of the context of their discovery. Realizing that most scientific success has historically been made in context to war does not mean that I wish for another. And as I said I am optimistic for the future precisely because the modern world is capable of coming together to build the LHC. That does not mean that I have to be interested scientifically in the outcome of that particular experiment. Please reread my earlier posts as you most definitely misread large parts of them.

Yet in other posts you advocate for hardforks. The only way to not steer bitcoin is to _not change rules_ at all.
This will not be poasible, I am aware of this. But the closestthing to not changing rules that we can go is to do it as soldomly as possible and only when it has no relevant oposition. This is e.g. where the "Consensus vs democracy" line comes from. The left side is much much closer to the ideal of not steering bitcoin.

They build max 750k blocks. Which is the default but not something that any pool should do these days, also from a fee income perspective. So the conclusion that they run just default for the time being and adjust parameters later is unfortunately quite realistic.

Thanks for answering in this detail.
Independend implementations are very valuable for the network. If nothing else, they can uncover edge cases that should be included in the test-suite to settle the rules for them, very much like btcd did (I run a btcd node, but that choice moght be biased just because I like go).

'Consensus' is what makes it deep into the blockchain. The 'network' is a layer of easy communication before that, but that is not consensus. You can just mail your transaction to a miner or send it by pigeon, bypassing the 'network' completely. If it makes it to the blockchain, it becomes consensus.
What happens in the network is a promise of intent to have something included. Not more. This promise can be broken in several ways.
@_date: 2016-03-01 14:24:51
This has been argued in both directions over and over.
No, with 2MB it would not be double as expensive. Miners would accept lower fee transactions with larger blocks. So it would probably be slightly more expensive but far from linear in block size. Disadvantages if blocksize scale stronger than advantages.

Starting up a node on a raspberry pi took from zero literally not more than 15 minutes. As a one-time investment. There are plenty of howtos around.

This is not entirely true, the sticky with the rules explicitly had that if you have something really new and substantial to say it is fine to do so.
Please look at the following post as an example:
That was during the absolute high of removed posts. Someone got his post removed without explanation and complained as a comment in a different thread. I took the time to lay out the reasons why his post got removed and in the end he kind of agreed that this was reasonable to do so, while in the beginning his feeling was the he got censored away.
If more time had been spent do explain to everyone why their post had been removed, we'd had much less problems. But who takes the time to do so?
tl;dr: This was in the sticky during the high of removing threads:


Many people were not aware that what they said was not a new argument and that removing it was actually reasonable because they did not read other peoples posts before writing their own.

Sure. But specifications can have unintended side-effects. Adam has a very good example with transaction malleability in this thread. So there are two options once you realize those. You can either fix the current one or build a new one. The second option usually leads to the better final result. I am a theoretical physicist and write a lot of code for simulations (I don't have a strong CS background though, so I am definitely not bragging about code quality here). Usually I develop my algorithms in python using a C++ framework that grows over time. Once I am happy with this proof of concept implementation I rewrite the same thing into the C++ framework to be usable from python for the next development. The C++ version usually does not even look similar to the python one. The second time I know what the thing that I am building should look like.
With Bitcoin we don't really have this option of building it (the blockchain part. Obviously there can be (and are) node reimplementations) again from scratch as the grace period of wide spread ignorance during the bootstrapping was a one time opportunity.
_Now_ would be a good time to sit down and collectively write a specification for the real deal. Unfortunately Bitcoin has to be kludged as we go which is inconsistent with my personal main attracting point of Bitcoin that it does not have a Fed-like entity that can change rules.
tl;dr Still loosing hope.

We are now at a point where we discuss how 'literally' a word from the 'creator' was. This is more and more transforming from a CS discussion to theology. I start to loose confidence that Bitcoin will make it.
There is this 'you have to build it once to know what the thing looks like that you are building when you build it the second (final) time' logic behind a lot of great projects. I had hoped that Bitcoin was an exception to this because we will not have a second shot. But when we start to discuss the whitepaper like religious people might discuss the Bible or the Qur'an, I loose that hope.

I am surprised the algorithms (e.g. bitcoinfees.github.io= still recommend fees that are much higher than when we last had a similar mempool. Seems similar to a large room with a decent amount of people in it. Everybody talks at moderate noise level. If you add background music, everybody needs to be louder than that and the average noise level increases. If you turn of the music again, the noise level won't decrease.
I'd guess that fee recommendation algorithms have some room for improvement.
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:06:11
For which part?
Do you assume that fees will stay the same if blocksize increases?
Yes: Why do you want an increase?
No: Making 2MB full will *not* be double the price of making 1MB full. Yes, it will be more expensive than making 1MB full, but it scales less than linear. The block propagation/verification is (mostly) linear. q.e.d.

if the receiving address is also yours you can use child-pays-for-parent. Basically, pay from the receiving wallet forward to another address with a fee that is high enough to pay for both transactions plus a bit. Some miners (as in, a recent version of core) are smart enough to identify that they can make a good deal by accepting both transactions instead of plainly refusing the first one.

The pope prefers the explanation 'God' for the existence of life. But according to science, this does not really capture the essence of what is going on.

It is not necessarily about brigading or not brigading. During high times the complete hotpage was about increasing blocksize. Many ither things happened that were burried under that load. If a newspaper article gets shared twice, the mods remove one and all is fine. If the same argument is posted twice and they do that people scream censorship. And of you see something you agree with im two posts you are likely to upvote it twice. This is not a net benefit fir the community.

I wanted to try Samourai wallet, but the android permissions are a turnoff. SMS? Phone? I understand that this is currently early access and this might likely change to the more state-of-the-art android permission model of only asking for the permissions once you need them, but it also means that I won't even be testing Samourai until this happens.
This is not a complaint of any sort, I understand that a wallet in development is not feature-complete. It's just a suggestion that you might just have more users testing your wallet if you address this one first.

So phone permission is only needed _if and when_ I enter a number for theses SMS.


Unfortunately there is no way of knowing that that's the actual code that the play store app was built from. I'll certainly build the wallet soon (the first free weekend) but it will push back many others. For a privacy-centered wallet those are invasive permissions even though I find the features those permissions enable awesome!
Again, this is not a complaint! These are very relevant features and I am looking forward to the finished app which is hopefully more conservative with asking permissions upfront.

Maybe. Yesterday also GBTC gained a relevant markup compared to BTC, which it did not have ever since an ETF became likely.
Then again, GBTC seems like a safe bet at the moment. 
If ETF comes -&gt; BTC rises -&gt; GBTC rises.
If ETF does not come -&gt; BTC loses a little, but GBTC regains the markup -&gt; GBTC rises.
So it might not be a signal after all.
If anything, I'd guess the reason is Antpool.

You know who connects their SPV nodes to my full node as well? Two of my colleagues. I have a domain with my last name and guess who has eMail addresses with their firstname All of my family.

I am aware that my mindset is not the usual one, but I think that's fine. I don't think that 85% of users should run their own nodes, like does. I think that 85% of users should be _aware_ of who does and be flexible enough to switch when they feel the need. And I am available to my wider circle to host it for them. Of that kind of person I think 1% of the population is plenty enough for both running the network in a secure way and allowing the other 99% to access it in a secure way.

As far as I cab see LN _is_ a hub-and-spoke system but since no trust is required to the hub (as in they can not run away with your funds), the landscape of hubs will be widely spread as opposed to the usual hub-and-spoke like ripple. So I'd say it technically _is_ a hub-and-spokes, but the role of the hubs in the system is vastly different.

The problem is, the capacity limit is a consensus rule. If I could go back in time and prevent it from being there (probably put the ddos prevention into the block propagation network, where it would have been effective but _not_ being part of the consensus rules), I would. But right now it _is_ a consensus rule and removing it would be steering bitcoin by changing rules.
Bitcoins immutible consensus rules are a higher ideal than cheap transactions. That's where "An inflation-free, censorship-resistant &amp; bearer asset vs an open, cheap &amp; fast payment system" comes from. Unfortunately also an *vs* in this respect, not an *also*

"sudo make install" won't safe you tube compared to "make &amp;&amp;  sudo make install". Make makes sure to not do work twice, so all the second option does is to spread the same work between two commands. The reason is that you usually want to do as little as possible with sudo and only the installation step *needs* super user rights. You will now have compilation files owned by root in your home that without sudo you can not remove, but that's probably about the only problem you have because of this. It is also good practice to but compile with super user rights for security reasons, but I am sure the bitcoin makefiles are well vetted.

Most of the traffic is for relaying transactions and blocks to others. Which is of course the social thing to do, but a minimalistic setup that you could connect a SPV wallet against (and I don't know if such a thing is implemented anywhere) would be to just leech a 1MB block every 10 minutes. Hardly any overhead relative to that.
That however would mean that you don't see payments _to you_ until they are included into a block, so not while they are 0-conf.

I have an actual honest question about this (and should add that I am very pro segwit). Segwit is solving the quadratic signature verification problem, but if non-segwit transactions stay valid indefinitely and segwit only solves it for the segwit ones (obviously?) doesn't this stay an attack vector?
On the other hand, making segwit tx's mandatory seems to be a softfork as well, so that could come in a second step after segwit tx's are the established default.

Yes, in particular you can also see that when the backlog rises dramatically, it does not get significantly more expensive to get in. At least not to the same extent.
What probably causes most of the problems is that fees that the wallets suggest are just *slightly* too small when the rise is sudden, which is of course unfortunate from the users perspective.
Based on the data it should be possible though to come up with better predictions than what we have now. Just look at the daily/weekly patterns. Add predictable raise after a strong retargetting and if wallets would keep all that in mind we might have much less problems in practice.

No, what makes you think that? If the miners mine what the users din't want, they won't be able to sell it. End of story.
Only if so many mine leave that the unforked chain can not support itself we might see some countermeasures. But that is very unlikely.

To be fair (and I am not at all pro BU): It is important to have absolute predictability about the future money supply. If Bitcoin would have been designed _from the very beginning_ to go towards 2% inflation, I might even have preferred that for several reasons.
The absolute no-go though is wanting to change that, which would break predictability.
So it being 21M or even capped at all, I don't care much. Sticking with what was announced on day one, absolutely super important and a *central property*!
@_date: 2016-06-22 08:25:18
This is not about pool fees. If (and yes, this is speculations and a strong 'if') the orphan rate is at 10% for small pools and say 2% for a large pool, then a meager 1% pool fee will not be any argument.
So for the numbers. No, I don't have strict numbers. Those are hard to come by before stuff is active. And I can not find the estimates at the moment. I might have more time to look for it later.
The basic outline is: Right now, block propagation and verification takes (numbers from memory, but I think my memory is quite good here) around 20 seconds. That is 10 seconds that the creator on a block can mine on the next block fully informed, while the other participants have to either still mine on the previous block (so they have a 10s/10m ~ 1.6% chance (which would be 1 or 2 a day. Checks out if you compare  so probably my numbers from memory are indeed quite good) for orphaning their blocks) or they can mine on the next header. This leads to two problems: First they have to trust that the next header is actually the header of a valid block. They might be tricked into mining on an invalid block which is detrimental to security of the network and is wasted time for them. The second thing is that even in the best case scenario they are losing the fees while validating. This might not be much now, but wait for three more weeks and the relevance of the fees will have doubled (don't extrapolate that though).
Since you don't have this penalty when you are part of the pool that mined that block, it is a good idea to be part of a large pool. The cost for not being on a 50% pool if there is one is roughly 0.8% of your potential earnings. That is a lot already (much more than I had guessed in my previous post), but it is smaller in practice because there is no 50% pool and your wish for decentralization of Bitcoin might be large enough to resist the temptation to join a 25% pool over a 10% pool for 0.24% loss of your profits.
Lets take 8MB blocks (yes, 2MB might not be an immediate problem). Assuming that the quadratic verification time problem is solved, this would be 80 seconds or 13% chance for an orphan if you mine on your own. If there existed a 50% pool, the cost of not being part of it would be 6.5% of your income. And make no mistake. In the previous case I could argue that a 50% pool will likely not exist. In this case it will. Because even if you would not choose a 25% pool over a 10% one for ideological reasons and forego 2% of your income, others will. And the larger the largest block is the larger the opportunity cost is of not being part of it. It will get more and more attractive the more people go there.
The problem is not negligible already. Lets not make it 8 times worse.
I can already hear your answer: Xthin blocks, header first, blabla. Yes, there are some solutions on the horizon. The problem with all the existing ones, that includes the relay network and Xthin blocks, is that they don't work under adversarial conditions. They are all prone to someone claiming to have found a block that he did not. They are trivially spamable and honestly I am surprised that they have not been. The reason for relay network is probably that it is private and it is thus possible to kick people out. Great, not _that_ is the scaling solution in the spirit of Bitcoin, right? Xthin has not been spamed because it lives on 150 nodes max at the moment. It is not important enough.
Invertible bloomfilters are interesting, I don't know enough about compact blocks. Maybe there is a solution to this problem. Lets hope there is. _Then_ we can talk about raising the limit.
Now here is an idea that I haven't seen anywhere else. It is more of an idea for an alt than for a change in bitcoin, but it would be a very interesting alt:
Send together with the header the proof that the header is the header of a valid block using SNARKs. This is getting too technical, but you can produce a small and fast to verify proof that some result is the result of actually running some specific algorithm without having the reveal anything else than the result and some byte of proof data. This sounds like black magic and it indeed is. This proof is easy and cheap to verify but it is tremendously costly to produce. But who cares? The work to find a suitable hash is costly to produce anyways.
Benefits: Trivial to fully validate block on header alone. Would put a lot of money into research about zero knowledge proofs.
Drawbacks: This is very new crypto. It might turn out to be insecure in the future. Bitcoin relies on decade old crypto primitives only for a reason. Totally incompatible with current rules.

Go and ask the economic actors how happy they are about BCH. And if -in case they want to press 2x against users and devs in November-they are likely to sacrifice 3 months of gains in BTC to jump over to BCH.
I am not saying the scenario will be lile this. I still hope there will be a good-will situation in November. But _if_ users and miners stand on two differet sides,I don't see the economic actors backpaddle 3 months. Mkre likely is that there will be a further split to B1x and B2x (both with segwit). I can not come up with a scenario in which economic actors will go back to BCH. Too many burned bridges. Ask coinbase...

Sure. The thing is, larger pools would be disproportionately less effected by orphans. For starters, they would never orphan their own blocks. That would make it more profitable to join an as large as possible pool -&gt; centralization

This could be very bad and maybe this thread includes all the information necessary for someone with sufficient javascript skill to get access to the 5BTC.
Here's why:
I might be very wrong, I don't speak javascript. But from looking at the code here ( shortly it seems to me that the qr reader returns success if the qr code can be either parsed as an address _or_ as a private key.
So what might have happened is that by accident the string "bitcoin&lt;1...&gt;" with your coinbase address instead of the angular brackets is a valid private key according to blockchain's logic.
Here is where it gets tricky. Because this means that whoever knows your coinbase public address and some basic javascript (which excludes me) might be able to construct the private key. So please delete _as quick as possible_ all mentions of addresses from this thread!
Going a little further in the blockchain.info code, the string mentioned above seems to fit the "base58" conditions. It is 41 characters long (which is between 40 and 44) and consists only of base58 characters.
Relevant code is here:  .
In that case we are looking at a base58 decoding of the string plus creating the ECPair according to  .
I hope the people from blockchain with help from the people from coinbase can help you recover the funds and that nobody else can get to them.
If I am right, then I would consider the bug to be on blockchain's side for silently accepting a malformed qr code as a private key.
Please be careful.

There is a stark distinction to be made between alternative clients, of which there are many and everybody (well, not everybody) is happy about this on the one hand and clients implementing alternative protocols on the other hand, which is a huge issue.

My best guess is they did not 'fail' to mine 6 blocks but dropped their hashing. If they are smart they'll keep it just below ine block every 2 hours for a while now.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:45:47
It _is_ much shorter than usual, which would be 2016 blocks. They added an extra check that if there are less than 6 blocks every 12 hours, difficulty will get down by 20%. What OP uses in his arguments is the current situation where there are just above 6 blocks per 12 hours (or if there are not, it would be reasonably easy for any relevant miner to get it above that threshold), so that this rule does not activate.

Thus core made the point that they don't have the power to do anything towards a hardfork, the community expressed their will, the Hong Kong agreement was fulfilled, we get SegWit. Win-win.

But the fee should be per byte of tx size, so more inputs, more fee. O(n)+const.
Miners might pick up the tx for free or little fee only as there is no backlog at the moment. I am not sure what the default answer of Bitcoin Core is regarding cheap tx's, but it does not matter as there are miners that don't use the default and at least one will probably run a rule that he includes everything in order of decreasing fee until block is full. No backlog -&gt; eventually the tx will go through. Might take time though.

Sorry to be picky with this minor difference. But I saw it too often lately. Bitcoin is a protocol, it does not have a license at all. "Bitcoin core", one particular implementation (although the most popular one) of this protocol is under MIT license. An other implementation can be ubder an other license. For example btcsuite is under copyfree license.

There is a very important distinction to be made between the bitcoin core software (which is just one of the implementations of a frontend to work with the bitcoin network and the blockchain), which should be as versatile as possible on the one hand and on the other hand the bitcoin blockchain protocol, which would have been nice if it had been designed around versatility when it came to life but which's main virtue is immutability.
That said, I think one of the main problems of the birth of bitcoin that it does not have a proper bitcoin blockchain protocol documentation. It is essentially defined by its reference implementation, which happens nowadays to be called bitcoin core. But apart from the obvious authority due to competence of the developers of that project, I do not consider it in any way more special than say the btcsuite.

No, qualitative is nit enough. To stay in your example, you should make assumptions as to how many people will how often need to settle on that settlement layer and show that the settlement layer can handle that. In case of lightning, settling would require one openening of a payment channel to a hub and one to close it. And it is secure only if closing can be guaranteed within a given time frame. Bith sides lack quantitative arguments right now, but I get the impression that one side is working on them much more fiercely than the other.

You _might_ argue that a fork with near total consensus is still bitcoin, but this is not what the current situation is about. Just like all of the above examples.

If it exists then many people have it in use and it does not work anymore. Or people try to sell their product by advertising how well it works for them but once you also run it you run into race-conditions with them and _then_ it does not work anymore. Either way, the answer is no.
I once wrote an altcoin triangular arbitrage bot more as an exercise for the programming language than to actually make money. Took around 10 hours of coding and earned me some money (starting from ~5mBTC to ~300mBTC within two month), but since the gain was restricted by the depth of the markets, thus the gain was linear in time, not exponential, I decided not to pursue this further when the exchange's API changed and I would have had to put more time into it.

Actually our name is inclined to think exponentially, not linearly. It is much more important to know if there is a tribe of 30 or 10 people attacking your cave than it is to know if it is 530 or 510 bats. The ratio is what matters, not the difference, which translates to exponential resolution (actually logarithmic resolution, but lets not make stuff complicated) instead of linear one.
You can make a very simple experiment with your not-too-technically-inclined friend.
Draw a line from A to B, tell him that on that line A represents one and B represents one million. Ask him to point at one thousand. Most people will point somewhere around one fourth to one third of the line (I actually did that test with a bunch of people (of course separated from each other), it is frightening how consistent the replies are), while on a linear scale between A and B people should point to 1/1000th the way, so (within the range of a fat finger) right on point A. One third of the way is roughly what you get when you assume a logarithmic scale (depending on the base of the logarithm, but again, not too complicated).
Leaving the interesting part behind, what are you trying to aim at with this post? Price explosion? Block size explosion with doubling every 2 years? I honestly don't see the immediate connection to To make a better (and more standard) example about exponential growth that surprises people: Put one grain of rice on the first field of a chess board, two on the second, four on the third, eight on the fourth...

You can not 'give away' a private key. It would always be possible to keep a copy.
What would really be great is if someone would develop a way to basically cast IOU's from the blockchain that can be handed around and used as currency without having to pollute the blockchain upon change of owner because everyone who has such a thing knows that he _could_ at any time redeem it on the blockchain.

btcsuite has its own implementation of the consensus rules, and the full node I run does a pretty decent job (ok, it is still syncing, I only put it up recently). While moving libconsensus to a separate project, it is still is definition of rules by implementation. I see your point that this might be necessary now, just because if a non-critical bug in "bitcoin core" (or openssl for that matter) has consensus for a month, it would be unreasonable to roll back that month after the bug has been found. I agree with that. But please don't tell me moving the definition-by-implementation to an own project is the best we can do. Compilers implemented by different companies manage to produce bit-compatible code (not bit-identical). In the same way, there should be (and are) compatible consensus implementations..
Regarding BIP's, yes, they are not solely for discussing the bitcoin "core protocol". Take bip-0020 as an example, this is to improve usability but won't change consensus in any way. They are a slightly better version of github issues and are in regard of a certain software project, not in regard of the bitcoin core properties, definitions and features. Unfortunately, said software project happens to be a reference implementation...
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:39:48


Which very much strengthens me in my view that we need as many as possible of those. I don't say we should go full rely-on-whitepaper-that's-enough-documentation. Just that I don't necessarily see the "bitcoin core" project as more special than other implementations, of which there are much too few. In that respect, it might even be a bad idea to separate out libconsensus.


Not at all. And honestly I don't care. Partly because I don't run a business based on that node, partly because after all, we are still in beta. But mostly because if btcsuite is attacked, the network won't fail. I'd be much more comfortable with having 20+ different implementations (similar to the 100+ different implementations of smtp) and knowing that there is no single point of failure. Find a critical bug in "bitcoin core" and you have your single point of failure. As you most definitely know, Pieter Wuille had the power to inflict just that for quite a while recently. ( Luckily it was him and not a "hostile actor", but I don't want to be forced to rely on trust, else I would not be into bitcoin to begin with.

@_date: 2015-08-04 12:58:17
This is why I did add "not necessarily in the technical sense", because I am aware that this is not very specific to bitcoin. To be temper-proof with respect to the rules, you need an as large as possible community to withstand that, which is specific to bitcoin as opposed to alts.
I don't care about some of the rules of bitcoin, I would be equally intrigued by a set of rules that limits the block reward to xBTC. But important to me is stability of the rules, so now that the halving until zero is fixed in the rules, I will fight to keep it that way.
What I was trying to point out is that on the one hand you seem to be very sure that there will never be consensus to change that rule and on the other hand we right now see consensus to change one of the other rules*. We are right now forming precedence for future change of blockchain-protocol rules. OP brought up an extremely relevant threat in this thread. I think you are being overly optimistic when taking for granted that cap will never be tampered with when right now we are seeing active tampering on the blocksize.
*Same disclaimer as above applies. This thread is not the point to discuss blocksize, but it is an interesting example to see how far changes on the protocol can reach.
@_date: 2015-08-04 09:17:26
The "most valuable feature" is something different for each and every participant in this experiment. For you (and many others) it might be the deflationary nature, for me it is the predictability and temper-proofness. Not necessarily in the technical sense but that I can be sure that nobody comes along and changes consensus rules. Mine is being undermined right at this moment, guess what might happen to yours when consensus forms (in 50+ years) to keep fees low (which is the "most valuable feature" for a whole lot of other people) and for that sacrifice the cap.
Disclaimer: even though I just said immutability of consensus rules is undermined right now, this is not really how I feel about it. But this is another topic, unrelated to this discussion here.
@_date: 2015-08-10 20:32:49
It would be really valuable to have a proper documentation of the blockchain standard. The whitepaper does a too rough job on that, essentially leaving the documentation to a reference implementation.
I run a btcsuite node, not because I distrust the  "bitcoin core" devs but because I believe that we have to get rid of the dependence of a monopoly on the interpretation of the ill-described consensus rules.
@_date: 2015-08-11 05:50:44
I think what really makes this whole topic (and others) difficult to argue is that the bitcoin consensus rules are currently defined by a reference implementation instead if stand-alone.
This makes it very difficult to distinguish the rules here. There is the bitcoin protocol, to which many people unknowingly refer to as the bitcoin "core protocol" and there is one of several implementations of this, the "bitcoin core" software. But as there are already other implementations around (btcsuite for one), I think it would be preferrable to do a separation, to not mistake "bitcoin core" developers with bitcoin "core developers".
That would help to make clearer the difference between software forks, which are not a problem, usual part of open source projects and even welcome in this on the one hand and on the other hand bitcoin protocol forks, which if course everybody can do, but which are essentially (yes, simple as that) an alt. An alt that might win, but an alt non the less.
I find it hard to argue that changes to the bitcoin protocol are currently discussed in terms of pull request, thus 'code' in one of the implementations, instead of independently!
That is not to say I distrust the devs, for all I care make the blockchain definitions a new git repo with (mostly) the same people respinsible that currently have push rights on " bitcoin core", but please make this distinction obvious. And it does not help that the name is "bitcoin core"...

To clear this up, he said he is running XT _and_ core _and_ other implementations. This is what paraphrased as 'along with all the others'.

You seem to assume that Satoshi does not make mistakes. Holy as he is, I sincerely doubt this. Satoshi said several things, among them that the maxblocksize can be increased later. But also among them that is the idea to create an monetary system with immutable rules. There is no entity that can change rules at whim.
At this pivot point, we have to sacrifice one of these things, I don't think this was apparent to Satoshi when he casually put a line in the consensus code. I hold the immutability of rules higher that the increase of maxblocksize. People lately argue that making this hard fork is good because it shows that Bitcoin can adapt. I concur.
Don't get me wrong. If I could get back in time to fix this block size issue, I would. Probably I would just put the limitation of the block into the block propagation code, not into the consensus code. That would have done equally well against spammers, but on a consensus level there would be no restrictions whatsoever, rendering the current debate obsolete.
So what do we do now? Nobody wants the current block limit forever. You don't, I don't, Satoshi doesn't and most devs don't want that either. But if we demonstrate that Bitcoin's rules can change by lobbying work of _two_ people, than there is not much sacredness anymore in the project. "Satoshi"'s mail, genuine or not, identified this problem pretty spot-on.
I think there are several options to get out of this mess, but all of these options are gone forever with this hard fork. I will list two:
- We could argue that Bitcoin is still beta. This is somewhat similar to what ethereum is doing. Right now rules can still change, but this would have to go along with consensus as to the point when beta is finished. And this better be in the pretty close future.
- Definition of the protocol rule by reference implementation is a very bad thing to have. We could argue that this is not what it is, that only what is in the whitepaper is actually relevant for the consensus rules and what came afterwards is temporary and not binding to alternative implementations by design. Unfortunately, the whitepaper does a too rough job at this. So what would have to happen is that devs would have to get back at the whitepaper and gist a consensus rulebook out of it. I don't like this approach because it resembles interpreting a bible. And good luck getting consensus about consensus.
Demonstrating that Bitcoin is susceptible to lobbying is not really a good idea...
Disclaimer: I have no idea if the mail is genuine. I don't care. It makes a few points that, although they have been around before, were far too much at the very outskirts of this discussion only. Probably I interpret Satoshi's idea in a way that suits my own perspective to the problem, but hey, so were you.

I am not  sure what mjsunderstanding has but feel free to ignore it.
You yourself decide how mich bitcoin you devote into a given payment channel to be usable in lightning network for how long. Worst case is that that channel misbehaves in some way (asking for aml or just blocking you). In that case you will have to wait the predetermined (by you) amoint of time to free your funds and open a channel elsewhere.
You will have to make an tradeoff between flexibility (short devotion times) and cheapness (long devotion times). Probably 's fear is that the on-chain transaction to open a channel will be so high that you essentially don't have a choice but to devote funds to a channel for very long, but don't worry, this will not happen. Everybody, especially LN devs (there is an interesting epicenter bitcoin episode with them) know that blocksize will hve to increase to prevent that. LN does not aim to replace bitcoin for payments.
@_date: 2015-08-12 15:59:56
Ok, admittedly I read over your comment too quickly, I should have been more careful to formulate the question.
Of course the blocksize can "scale in tandem with average hardware and bandwidth capacities" For that you could also have given Pieter Wuille as a reference (or any other "bitcoin core" dev), who build his own proposal to do just that and I am all for that.
However, Bitcoin's economical growth outperforms the growth in hardware and bandwidth capacities by far.
So I'd have to rephrase the request to: Please provide three reliable and well-educated people who believe that scaling blocksize to 8MB by Junuary 2016 does not have centralization effects.
You lose Satoshi as a reference, who (I think this is somewhat clear by now) did not anticipate for the speed of adaption and are left with Gavin and Mike. Which makes just the two who made me ask for three.

Then please let me put my money where your mouth is!
I agree with you that multiple implementations are important and implementation by reference is far from ideal! If a plethora of implementations of a well documented standard were available, it would not matter if a single implementation developa a quirk, the consequences are of the order of the market share. An businesses would obviously run several implementations and be aware of differences in behaviour.
Sounds.much more healthy to me than a single implementation/reference. This is not to say the 'bitcoin core' devs don't do a great job, but it is a single point of failure...

I am not comfortable with frequent changes to the consensus rules.
Everyone has a different reason to be interested in Bitcoin, for me it is much more than anything else the predictability. To be sure that nobody steps in to change the rules to adapt to a current situation. This is just what the fed does...
I am somewhat agnostic to blocksize, I view that as a technical question more than a political one and trust that a technical solution will be found. But the offhand way you talk about doing changes to the protocol (the blockchain protocol, I don't care about communication protocols) frightens me!
In 40 years people might argue that it would be better to not decrease the mining reward further in order to maintain cheap transactions. There might even be a significant majority for this. At that point I would be much more comfortable looking back at 46 years of unchanged (up to security fixes) blockchain protocol stability than at frequent hard forks following some sort of zeitgeist.

This is basically the reason why I am against hard forks whatsoever. If I could go back in time to change the blocksize, I would. But there must not be precedence of changing consensus rules. Or coinlimit will go away as well. If this means death to bitcoin and some altcoin comes up with the right rules upfront, then so be it.

According to Poon and Tadge,  they expect a leverage of roughly a factor of 10 in numbers of transactions per blockchain transaction. For mass adoption, the blocksizelimit would still need to be increased if nobody comes up with an even better solution, but this can be done at due time. As a last resort...
But with these numbers in mind, you will see that the cost you gave in your example are way, way, way overestimated.
@_date: 2015-08-10 16:00:03
Major con: It is a hard fork, thus precedence for future changes. While I am somewhat agnostic to blocksize and dearly wish the spam limit had been put into the block propagation network back when instead of in the consensus code, I fear a time when block rewards become negligible...
Bitcoins highest virtue is different for every participant in this experiment. For me it is termperproofness of the consensus rule. Nobody can come along and change rules. Guess I was wrong about this after all.

They mostly focus on back-end with an micropayment API. Which works pretty well. The idea is more that you (as a programmer) create micro-services and charge others small amounts to use it.
For example there are a lot of price-comparison websites out there for travel and for a lot of airlines don't provide API's to those aggregators to get prices. You could potentially write a scraper that gets the prices or reverse engineer an airlines pricing model and then offer the pricing information to aggregators for a few cents.
Currently the large aggregators have dedicated teams for that but this kind of selling microservices could be an monetization model for small independent developers who want to target one airline only.
Note that it is _not_ the customer who would pay for this service, but the aggregator. The customer might not even know this. The customer only pays indirectly by then buying from the aggregator.
I wrote a simple proof-of-concept password cracker as a service.
Please note that I don't advertise this service. I did not make up my mind yet if this is useful or not. But it is there and it is certainly understating to say that they don't have any product.
I saw a talk from Balaji where he also talked about the way that the payments would be made, either on-chain or in custodial accounts at 21, which (at the time I saw the talk sometime last year) where the only two implemented but they were also working on a micropayment hub model where everybody would have a payment channel open to 21 and payments are routed trustlessly between two peers. This seems to be similar to what yours came out with. In some sense this is some shitty centralized pre-version of Lightning, but is much easier to implement and does by design not have a routing problem.
The paid eMail service is most likely just advertising their services, similar to this do-simple-tasks-app.

The address is .edu.au, which guarantees that this is a university in Australia.

The 8mb tag indicates EB. Compare with  .
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:30:48
If 1MB equals 30 seconds of validationless mining for and empty block, then 2MB equal 1min of validationless mining for and empty block (roughly).
So 2MB blocks will not allow for double the throughput but less than that. Still a net gain probably, but not linear. Take the extreme example of 20MB blocks (which was actually proposed) and you would have about the same number of full blocks that take 10 minutes to verify and empty blocks (yes, I am aware how much of a simplification this is). So roughly a factor of 10 in throughput and a factor of 20 in badness of attacks (even assuming there is a protection agains n^2 problems).
0MB is a bad idea, 20MB is a bad idea. The best number lies in between and nobody knows where. Discarding this argument as FUD is disingenuous. Claiming to know that the best number is below 2MB is disingenuous as well.
But since nobody knows the number, I'd prefer the conservative option of optimizing first and figuring out where this number lies and then doing a proper increase afterwards over rushing it any time.

The question is, when is it less disruptive to the Bitcoin economy. For business models that arouse around perceived promise of future fees, for expectations of the consumers.
I do see your point, but I'd rather set expectations straight (with respect to reality) as soon as possible instead of deferring it to some unknown point in the future. You see, the resistance against change will rise with the size of the economy. So how do you prevent fees from going above 5ct in 20 years? Well, even though everyone will tell you now that this is way out of question, I am pretty sure it will be tempting to just prolong the delay the decay of block reward. To keep miners engaged, to create security. Sure, there will be somewhat more Bitcoins overall, but hey, the ones that pay the price for that are the hodlers, so the ones that also profit from the usability and the security of the system. They are probably fine with that.
There go your fundamentals.
Disclaimer: I don't even necessarily think that going to a fixed block reward at some point would be a bad idea. The inflation rate would still drop like 1/time, which is fine with me. What is completely out of question to me though is to fiddle with the rules that were set at the beginning. If these rules become a matter of debate, we are no better than the Fed. The block size limit is a nuisance that will have to change at some point. If I could go back in time I would try my best to convince Satoshi to put it into the network part. Limiting block propagation to 1MB would have been just as good as a DOS prevention measure and would have made this discussion obsolete (yes, I do understand that this is somewhat what Bitcoin Unlimited tries to do, I don't support that nevertheless. It is all about _not changing rules_!). Now unfortunately this limit will have to change in some way while making entirely clear that this is not a promise of future interventions into rules for the sake of the economy. The stupidest thing the Bitcoin community could do is to "practice" hard forks.

Forking software and forking the blockchain by changing the consensus rules are two completely different things that just happen to be called by the same term out of bad luck.
You might make a fork of say thunderbird to add a feature that you feel it lacks, say some fancy mail sorting order. Nobody will complain that you do so. If your fork of thunderbird creates eMails and tries to send them around that are not recognizable as eMails by other clients, than this would fork the eMail protocol. Sure, this might happen. But better be extra careful that you know what you are doing. That you are sure everybody follows and that you plan way ahead so that communication does not break down. And if in the discussion with other clients' devs you realize that there might not be a smooth transition with everybody who cares following, it is better to run the boring but safe option to strictly stick to the status quo.

The pool of unconfirmed transactions waiting to be included into the blockchain.
Actually mempool is an extremely bad name for that since it refers to the way these transactions are currently stored in the bitcoin core code. But in future versions or in alternative implementations it migjt very well be possible that unconfirmed transactions that are not required to go through soon are stored in a database or file on disk, not in memory. Lets see how it will be called then. But at the moment, it is just mempool.

That's the theoretical gain of asicboost discounting any implementation overhead.

The problem with auditing yourself to get a credit limit at an exchange is that you can have this limit at several brokers.

I for one run btcsuite/btcd, a completely different implementation in a completely different language.
I agree with you that having one of the currently few but potentially many implentations acting as a reference implementation is a very bad situation but I come to the opposite conclusion of that. Imagine we have 100 implementations with 1% market share each. Imagine one implementation would change consensus rules. What would happen? The client would fail to sync and people would switch to another implementation.
A plethora of implementations is needed to prevent consensus change (or require a true 95+% consensus for it) not lobbying between 2 implementations to reach it.

It is important because 21 needs to guarantee that the microtransactions paied for these services actually make it into the blockchain, without being eaten by fees.

I was just ppinting out that changes on consensus code should allow time for alternate implementation to check, double check and tripple chack that they are consistent. But hey, this is not relevant after all.

Withdrawing to cash gets you oit of the international payment network, 'withdrawing' to bitcoin does nothing. In bitcoin, banking is a matter of convenience, not of participation.

Only if he actively sends it back. And even then, 'returning back' is very much not recommended. (See 
Anyways, since all transactions are public, you could see this in a block explorer when looking at his public key. It will show if the funds have been moved somewhere else and you can then also see if they have been moved into your direction.
Also, your wallet should show you an incoming transaction.
If 'the guy' says this but you don't see it, ask for a transaction id. If he can not produce one, that should light up all red flags! (It already sounds very shady).

Full node operators could additionally run a lightning hub and and thus have the user open a payment channel with them. Then the user can pay for SPV requests as a one hop lightning payment. Hardly any additional costs/no fees additional to the payment for the request.
This combination is compelling because the properties that you'd want from a SPV server and a lightning hub a about the same.

If you sent it to this address by typo (which should have a chance of 255/256 (I think) of being prevent by checksums), then it is 'lifetime of the universe'-unlikely to be in possession by someone else.

Human Brauns are a very bad randomness generator.
Your passphrase is ~100 charakters, which likely is ~20 words. This sounds good so far. The problem is that those words are not independent. You might have started with a random word and went to the next ones by (unconscious) association. Or even worse, it might be a sentence...
12 words are enough to be completely unbruteforcable, but only if the words are uncorrelated.

Hiw about a reference where a post was re.oved and after I talked to the poster, he actually kind of agreed that it was right that the mods removed his post? 
The current post is different in three respects.
1. we are not at the height of the diacussion anymore. But we are getting there again...
2. OP put bullet points. Great...
3. OP gave an overview of reasons, not just a single one. This is the only point I can let skip for relevance, although a weak one.
Please note that I don't argue that OP is wrong. I do have an opion on that but it does not matter now. However, you'd be surprised. My point is that his post brings _absolutely nothing_ new to the duscussion.

@_date: 2016-05-26 23:13:37
Due to checksums it is close to impossible to have a typo in an address or anything of that type. So if you sent it to the wrong address, it has to be an address you found somewhere, e.g. copied it from the wrong source. If you can figure out that source, your best guess is contacting the owner of that address. No other chance.

That was my first reaction too, but this only means some CHF2000 per month income in fees. Compare that with the risk they take of having that much fiat in the machine or the cost of paying someone to empty it every few days and there is not much net gain left.

So you say "15% inflation per year" (an actual phrase from the OP) stays 15% when the number of Bitcoins created would stay the same but the number of Bitcoin in circulation increases?
Please look up what "%" means...
Inflation in %: (number created in one year)/(number in existence) * 100
If either changes (the numerator changes every 4 years, the denominator changes every 10 minutes), the inflation rate changes...
