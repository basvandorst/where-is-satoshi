Considering his background in online payments it's not that surprising to see him take an interest in crypto. 
On the other hand he also sold "flamethrowers" and has only posted cryptic tweets.
Either way should be interesting to see what happens.

But after each new ath and correction there's been a period of slower growth back up to that all time high. That slow growth usually sticks around whereas the crazy all time highs just show the future potential.
What does it actually say about  Bitcoin if the price goes from $10k to $20k+ in a fortnight?
I can't see how anyone can look at an almost vertical graph and believe it's good healthy growth for Bitcoin.
For their own short term gain maybe, and that's fine for them. Just not for Bitcoin, not in the long run.
I'm all for new highs. I believe Bitcoin is worth 6 digits and can't wait for it to get there,  but can we at least let the price consolidated a little bit before we all jump on the next bubble?

Don't we all ��.
 I just want time above 50k with out having to worry about it shooting to $100 before dropping back to $10 over a weekend. 
Meh, I'm just greedy, want to have my cake and eat it.

Am I the only one who doesn't want a quick run up to $20k/$50k/$moon? 
Like last time it hit $20k it crashed out for 18 months and as soon as it starts to recover people are hoping for the same again? 
Cause if it really does follow the pattern like everyone hopes it's going to drop quicker then it raised. 
I would dearly love to see Bitcoins above $20k but I'm more then happy to wait a bit if it means they will stay there.

The lightning network is in a much better state then it was. 
So even if the fees did run up it would still be possible to do cheap, quick off chain transactions.
How that actually plays out is another matter.

I've done the same thing and was while I was able to recover the wallet.dat file, it was too damaged to be of any use.
There is software that can potentially recover deleted and overwritten files. 
It really depends on how much damage has been done since then, the more you write to the drive the less chance you have of recovering them.
I would recommend something like [runtime.org/data-recovery-software]( or something similar. I've heard of similar forensic tools that have managed to recover 3TB of data from a 1TB drive. The software above also offers a free demo that will show you recoverable files but will make you pay to recover them. 
You would have to install the software on another PC and plug your drive into it. The software has an option for deep/sustained damage. It will take some time as it goes through and looks for not just deleted files but files from previous installs. 
You would have to find out where wallet you used saved the wallet file. It could be something like wallet.dat some where in the C:/Users/wtfcarll/Appdata folder.  
There is a chance that there is underlying physical damage done to your hard drive in the form of bad sectors. Depending on how bad the damage is there is a chance that the recovery program can make the issue worse and ruin your drive.
I personally don't like your odds of getting them back, several installs of Windows and the associated use would do a pretty good job at wiping them from existence. 
HDD recovery is a whole field in itself and this is a quick run down with lots of assumptions based on not enough information. 
While this isn't a complete guide hopefully it points you in the right direction.
