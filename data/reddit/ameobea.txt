I know I'm going to get hate for this, but from what I've read about issues and glitches and uncertainties I honestly don't think that a Trezor is better than writing down private keys on a piece of paper and putting them in a safe.

If the dealer is using new addresses each time he buys, I don't see how it's possible to leak information.  Even if the guy you're buying from uses the same address each time there's no way to trace those purchases to the dealer, right?

Something new is happening every day; some new bitcoin startup is coming out: a new exchange is launching in another country, some new technology is being built on top of the blockchain, a big company starts accepting bitcoin.  
That along with the fact that its use will never deminish helps to keep it useful and relevant to modern society and a valuable asset for people to have.

There's a massive, worldwide, and 100% secure system that exists that is comprised of hundreds of millions of dollars of state of the art hardware, and anyone can access it for free.  
The idea for Bitcoin is fucking amazing.  
EDIT: Well almost for free.

I used Zencloud when it was first launched, before it became scammy and unprofitable.  I was lucky enough to escape the situation before people started using money, and actually made a fair bit of money off out of the whole thing.  
All in all, I think that cloud mining is a really neat concept that could work really well in certain situations, but having absolute trust is a must.  
Although I succeeded in profiting, there were hundreds or even thousands of others that lost some or all of their investment.
@_date: 2015-05-23 05:26:00
Global acceptance and availability has always been one of the big goals of bitcoin - this feels like huge news to me!

I wonder if any ASICs will become useless after the block size increase.  I'm not 100% sure about how the mining process works, but if there's an ASIC that doesn't have enough memory to hold the bigger blocks I feel it wouldn't work, right?
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:56:45
I'm no expert, but it looks like we broke that:

I thought that they hashed the current blocks, though.  Or am I not understanding something?
@_date: 2015-05-23 02:05:33
Ahh - I misunderstood.  Thanks for the clarification!
@_date: 2015-05-23 04:57:32
So by "regulate," do they mean make it illegal to use it, or tax it heavily, or require you to submit all your transactions with it, or what?  
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:44:02
If it's private, meaning the public can't hash on it or see it, it's pointless.  
If it's public, then who's going to spend millions of dollars buying hardware to maintain it, when there already exists a far more established, less restrictive one?

Good thing the price of storage is going down so much - the blockchain is going to get **big**, especially with all the things like colored coins and custom data being added in along with transactions.

I think that may be more of the kind of thing that happens with personality evaluations, where one standard description fits almost everyone.  
General quotes like that (aside from the bitcoin one of course) seem to be applicable to many different situations and seem related due to their ambiguity.

Well my idea is something like swapping private keys.  Perhaps 21 uses some complicated multiple-key method that would allow the transfer of a private key from party to party without using a transaction.
@_date: 2015-05-22 08:33:09
A bitcoin is nothing more than proof that you have control of an address, which is really nothing but a private key, which is really nothing but a few hundred ones and zeroes.  
The idea behind a paper wallet is that those ones and zeroes aren't anywhere where they can be leaked/corrupted/lost/hacked.  
As long as your flash drive contains the private key for your wallet and won't corrupt or degrade with time, it's a safe way to keep your bitcoin as long as no copies of that private key exist on a computer or anywhere else they could be compromised or lost.

Well, I don't know.  I thought full nodes had to have the full blockchain, right?  A lot of full nodes are based on 128GB flash drives or other small storage systems like that, and I can see that number being hit very easily.

Google's a LOT bigger than just the google.com search engine, kiddo.  If you were to charge money for searches, every device that interfaces with google would have to be stocked up with funds to use their site.  
Other, free search engines would take over.  The idea is impractical due to the fact that free is infinitely better than even 1/100 of a cent.

There's no real way to verify that people are in proximity.  If you use GPS, you can do things like spoof gps signals or make hardware-level changes to the devices.  
What's to stop someone from taking the algorithm, running it on a high-powered GPU or ASIC, and just telling it that you're in a certain location without actually connecting it to GPS?
It's a cool idea but I don't think it would be possible.
@_date: 2015-08-23 02:14:39
Yes, they can be.  Anything is a currency; it's just a matter of their utility (grapes dry out and turn rotten and can get smushed, etc.) that makes some currencies better than others.

I'm pretty sure a lot of the recent price rise has been the Greek crisis and Chinese stock losses.  Bitcoin always tends to go up when other financial systems go down.  There could be any number of contributing factors, though.
The litecoin rises may be from people hedging their bitcoin investments into litecoin due to the forks/impending hard fork and similar reasons to the bitcoin rise.  Crypto does what crypto wants; it's often hard to trace price moves to individual reasons or predict future movements.
@_date: 2015-07-10 19:15:43
Oh man were you right. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 19:33:13
Just saw a post yesterday showing that dish accepts btw. 
Also, the price hasn't 'recovered' because it wasn't meant to be that high. It was a bubble which resolved itself. If you look at the larger scale and ignore the bumps, bitcoin has been up and up slowly and steadily over the long term. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 07:49:43
It's a conspiracy, man.
@_date: 2015-07-07 04:16:11
Are the three original wallets multisig or just three separate wallets each containing their own bitcoins?  
If the latter is true, you can just import the private keys using a QR scanner in a bitcoin app like Mycelium for Android or iPhone.  Once you have them imported, you can send them off to the new paper wallet you generate.  
If they're multisig, I'm not sure how you would do that but you can probably use some utility that came with the program you used to make them.

Pretty much everyone here believes in the long-term practicality and value of Bitcoin, and I personally believe that its current value and market cap are tiny compared to what they should be given its nature.  
As you said, however, it is a risky investment and we could see a massive drops before we reach "the moon," or it may fail entirely.  
As for Coinbase, yeah it's pretty much the easiest way to buy/sell and I use it myself.  
@_date: 2015-07-14 04:03:17

It's just risk vs. risk.  A lot of people here are **very** paranoid about trusting any company/person/government with their money so would rather hold their bitcoins themselves.  
By leaving them in Coinbase, you run the (small) risk that the company catastrophically loses their backups and wallets and your bitcoins or refuses to give them back in the future for some reason.  
By holding them yourself, you run the risk of losing the paper wallet/flash drive/etc. in a fire, accident, etc.  
My advice would be to generate a paper wallet (I can link tutorials and sites if you're interested - they're very easy to set up and maintain) and put it in a safe/safety deposit box.  However, if you choose to go the coinbase route, I think you'll be equally safe.
@_date: 2015-07-20 04:28:41
All the news is good news; now we just wait for the price to catch up.

HD wallets are designed to provide a pool of addresses whose funds are all available to be spent as one.  By their nature, the outputs they keep track of aren't meant to be kept separate or unique.  
From what you said, it sounds like you'd just want to generate individual addresses (they're very easy to generate) instead of using a wallet.  
I don't know if the service you use provides that option, but there are services out there than can generate you addresses and their corresponding private keys.  That way you can keep them separate instead of all together in a HD wallet.

Find one or several cheap, possibly used miners for sale. If you really do have free power, and find a good deal, it's certainly possible to roi in around 6 months or so. Keep in mind other things like heat and noise, because many of the miners you will find cheap are power inefficient beasts.

Please keep in that you're talking to some of the most hardcore bitcoin supporters out there. You want to make money, right? Well the fact is that if you don't sell you'll never make money unless the dream of mass bitcoin adoption becomes a reality. 
The fact is bitcoin has just as much of a chance to go to $50 as $5000 in the coming years. Check out some price charts - we just now got over a big price bubble. If you think bitcoin is going up in the future, buy away. But please remember that bitcoin isn't a free money ticket.
