Tell your father to start a bitcoin exchange service then :-)
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:39:15
yes, possible but highly unlikely..
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:39:24
Do you remember how many bitcoins you had in your BFX account?
If it was 27-ish, then your bitcoins have been stolen.
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:21:33
Zane, you are the greatest asset of Bitfinex!
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:35:37
Kudos for what you are doing here. Just to make things a bit clearer, my deposit address (for the exchange) is 
I have not logged in BFX for weeks and I think I had around 15 bitcoins. Now I see this transaction:
which is 10 hours old and which debits this bitcoin address by 15.12321917 BTC
Does this mean my account has been compromised?
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:17:38
I think this is the best approach but what about:
 - did you identify and eliminate the reason for the hack? If not, everyone will withdraw and you have no more profits to redeem the BFX tokens...
 - why not entitle BFX holders double profits. That is, if I lose $100 now, my BFX tokens should entitle me to $200 in revenue. 
 - will you keep using BitGo, which obviously totally discredited themselves?
I think those are important questions whose answers wll make the difference about Bitfinex' future...

Absolutely great idea and I urge the authors to submit a formal BIP

In Berlin (and soon other places) you need a license to be able to rent your apartment  at AirBNB. You can't do it without because you get paid per bank from AirBNB and thus government can catch you.
If you can receive payments in bitcoin, then the government needs to become more creative in tracking you down
@_date: 2015-06-10 09:29:13
why so rude brother, I am just mentioning :)?
I came on the idea previously about images - try to guess how the majority will perceive it. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 05:51:38
It is a very specific case :)
@_date: 2015-06-18 12:02:20
It is working now, all fine with the transactions but I hope they see what the reason was...
@_date: 2015-06-24 23:08:11
thanks a lot!
@_date: 2015-06-25 02:31:53
Well, it is a slim hope but worth exploring something, which I don't want to reveal so that less elaborate thieves don't get better at covering their trails :)
@_date: 2015-06-10 12:22:40
Well, that's the question... If you make the "bet" only a few satoshi big, it would be negligible to be considered gambling. 
But I also cannot see Apple approving of it.
@_date: 2015-06-22 12:38:40
I also had this idea sometime ago. If you have a way to monetize the incoming traffic from the shares, absolutely do it :)!
@_date: 2015-06-10 09:30:11
Yeah, only it will take them ages until going online and more ages until they get the masses to use them...
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:33:32
I hope bitstamp closed the account of the manipulator :)
Where did his wall at $300 disappear?
Time to buy back I guess :)
@_date: 2015-05-22 12:59:09
Well I think this one has chance to turn into the killer bitcoin app...
Where can I see a list of available streams - I really want to test it as a viewer but cannot find a running channel
@_date: 2015-05-23 06:37:40
Well, I think you have done enough :) It is the turn of the entrepreneurs among us to start building services around this great app 
@_date: 2015-05-28 04:18:16
What's the idea letting you collect 45 bits at most and then saying you need at least 100 bits to cash out. Like getting you answer 15 or so questions for free?
@_date: 2017-02-27 14:38:31
Totally agree and I have thought the same many times.. How could we achieve it - some kind of public challenge, promise to raise the block size if he still insists after 5-10 sessions?
@_date: 2017-02-27 14:40:27
cause you don't get the idea behind it (yet)... but trust me, you will soon..
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:50:47
yeah, but you were using okcoin.cn I guess
@_date: 2017-02-27 14:59:56
True but the idea behind bitcoin will change the way the world functions, solving many problelms, albeit far from all of them..
Respect for following bitcoin since 2011 - I hope I don't get disillusioned like you after 2 or so years :)
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:01:32
The PBOC policy seems to concern only okcoin.cn

I am writing an article about Streamium for the Bulgarian portal on bitcoin education hash.bg and I have a question:
Is it possible for the streamer to remain anonymous in some easy way? 
I guess streamium.io has the IP of the streamer as well as maybe the viewer himself through inspecting his network. 
What can you tell us about this, 
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:18:40
The screen shot in the OP is what I get after I click Resolution Center on this message (showing right after I log in)
I have no interest to pursue the matter any further...
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:53:49
true but I cancelled my prepaid Master card they have on file :D
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:03:10
You do, thanks for the hint. I will now disable my linked credit card :)
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:49:16
can you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-03-10 12:08:26
here are my transactions in the last two months. The refunded funds are in the accounts of my friends..
@_date: 2017-03-12 09:57:13
No, they not only did not ask me for documents, they informed me there is no need for me to contact them because their decision is final (can be seen on one of the screen shots I posted in another comment)
PP did the refunds, not me! And my friends did not ask for refunds.
The age of my account is like 8-9 years.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:29:16
Yes, I rarely use it but I have had it for a long time now - at least 9-10 years
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:33:22
Haha, now I got it - so very true...
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:14:17
They did the refunds. My two friends told me the money is in their accounts. One of the friends has his account locked up after he phoned them. They told him on the phone they cannot see a reason for our accounts being locked. Then they asked him to send an email.  Shortly thereafter his account has the same status as mine.
I am in negative now after they forced the refunds....
@_date: 2017-03-17 10:19:56
you know what I mean :)
@_date: 2017-03-12 18:03:39
Did the balance get near 0 many times in 8 years? - NO
They spoke to you over the phone? - NO
Have you tried making the balance not zero recently? - NO
Depositing money to the account? - NO
Can you still sign-in? - YES
You didn't exactly answer the refund question. Refunds are made because of problems. Did you have many refunds in 8 years? - NO
If you had a couple small problems in 8 years that is a problem. - I had zero problems so far, I rarely used PP as you can see from my account statement posted in another comment. 
Did you call PayPal? - Fuck NO, I am happy to have my account closed
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:19:00
yes - 
@_date: 2017-03-10 12:54:18
Well, they are not private transactions so I did not even need to cover them... Real friends and family transfers....
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:01:09
I live in Bulgaria... My balance is negative after they refunded the two transacitons. I hope my friends will return the money to me..
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:48:40
Hahah :)
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:29:32
you are way off, brother :)
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:03:11
As much as I respect Daniel for his work on NI, I prefer to stay with the judgment of Andreas Antonopolous in his recent LTB video on the DAO. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:08:05
if you are in turkey and live close to the bulgarian border, you can make a trip there and buy bitcoin easily with cash at easypay or cashterminal. Prices are bare 1% higher than kraken.
@_date: 2016-11-27 18:04:02
Absolutely correct!
Which software company in its right mind will choose NOT to implement a completed and tested solution that will make its services way better?
@_date: 2016-11-03 07:22:39
Fuck ViaBTC - all miners, please get the fuck away from them!
@_date: 2016-12-03 10:26:37
Great 
@_date: 2016-12-21 19:51:49
As far as I know, SegWit makes Lighting Network possible, which will solve the scalability issue...
@_date: 2015-08-17 08:01:32
These rules have nothing to do with the spirit of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:20:46
I think this is a great idea - miners should be able to accept blocks with larger size than their own setting though...
@_date: 2015-08-03 20:01:14
check out neteller.com
@_date: 2015-07-23 15:32:39
There is something I do not agree with or maybe do not understand.
Let's say I now have 10 BTC in current bitcoinQT address 1xyz.... 
Then comes bitcoinXT. 
Is it not true that I have 10 bitcoins in both versions? 
So, if I wait and do nothing until the dust settles, I will have 10 bitcoins in the winning fork..
@_date: 2015-07-18 12:23:34
Can you give more information/link with details. 
Should be easy to get power and decent internet.

Because this island is meant for relax for the likes of Johnny Depp. We can find better ones - not necessarily in Greece :)

Warren Buffet just bought another Greek island, you might be right :)
There is a site for islands on sale:

I am wondering why there is no plug-in or even protocol for credit card data...
Entering credit card details is no less pain than paying with bitcoin, even though cc payments are so popular 
@_date: 2015-07-26 08:33:43
Thanks for elaborating but I still can't figure out the math, even if bitcoin were widespread enough.

We create a DApp on top of the island. Sell shares and thus finance the purchase. With the remaining capital we biuld a small crypto based economy on the island, may be I need to lay out the details in a separate document. I was just curious how many other people have similar ideas in their heads
@_date: 2015-07-28 15:02:15
I have thought a lot about this question. And failing to find a good answer keeps me from moving all my money there.
Best guess I have is that they are betting on bitcoin's price rising. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 08:32:16
Poor Izabella  :(
@_date: 2015-07-25 12:24:50
I read it carefully about this but I do not understand something. Let's start with a machine with 1000$ in cash and 3.3333 bitcoins inside, price is $300 per bitcoin.
There comes someone and buys 1 btc for $300. So we sell 1 btc for $300. Then if we raise the price at the machine, we will be buying 1 btc for more than $300, so we are losing money.
If we lower the price in the ATM but the price on the market has risen or stayed at $300, no one will sell to us when he can sell for more elsewhere.
What's the catch?
@_date: 2016-09-04 13:32:19
The only safe way to handle it... Too many customers send from wallets they do not own, like exchnages, faucets, etc...
Otherwise, if you know for sure the customer used his own wallet to send you the funds, then any of the sending addresses should belong to her....
@_date: 2016-09-09 11:54:14
I thought even the hardest proponents of bitcoin replacing the credit cards have already gathered, it won't and needn't...
@_date: 2016-09-21 17:40:10
you never know, let's wait and see - it cannot be bad to try out new things...
@_date: 2015-09-02 11:06:12
the bigger airplanes offer WiFi to the passengers, so it should be possible...

Bulgaria is no less a *"bitcoin capital of the world"*. 
Via [Crypto.bg]( you can buy bitcoins (~2% markup) at thousands of cash terminals in the country
[CashTerminal Map](
Also you can buy and SELL bitcoins at over 2500 EasyPay cash desks:
[EasyPay Cash Desks](
All this is possible without needing even registration, limits are around $3000 per transaction, as many transactions as you will.
EDIT: Not to mention that you can buy bitcoins at any traditional ATM in the country with a credit/debit card issued by a Bulgarian bank.

Not that I know of... Excluding the vision of terabytes large blockchain...

Is it open source?
@_date: 2016-10-15 11:44:45
If the price gets to 10k there will be something very wrong with the fiat currencies.. So no one will sell then..
If, however, a bubble develops aka MtGox, I will be selling to  prevent bubble inflating too much. 
I think that 600-ish is a stable equilibrium price today... 
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:43:32
what a disaster
@_date: 2015-11-20 02:23:39
Congratulations Mike!
I believe permissioned blockchains will have a very positive effect on the world as a whole (bitcoin included) and it is soothing to know that the banks do it right by hiring someone who does know what it is all about.

I wish I had read this posting couple of days ago. After I paid by PayPal for tickets from qatar airways, my credit card issued by neteller held the payment until I did a ton of verifications. After I sorted out the payment, qatar did not issue the tickets because their system does not have procedure for this use case. My booking is now expired but my money somewhere in Qatar airways. Waiting for them to apply the payment to my new booking or return the money. And it is more than 4k usd.. 
It will get sorted out I guess but how much time and effort did I need to spend on a simple payment operation...

if you add blockchain.info's reward and negative fees, you'll get a reasonable result
