lol I found the rumors. What a coincidence, that guy who was bashing this guy's post suddenly decided to delete his account.

I don't think there is enough reason to believe they're insolvent yet.... The post basically says the following:
* Sina newswire posted fake news about cryptocurrency ban in China. You guys probably remember this: 
* Litecoin flash crashed to 1 yen on Huobi due to margin calls.
* Huobi is demanding info from Sina on who posted the fake news so they can take legal action. Houbi is the lender and suffered the loss.
* Huobi says that they will pay back the margin losses for people who were insured 70 RMB per litecoin, which is ~11$ USD. This means huobi lost money on the margin call, and are paying customers back in addition to that.
* Huobi doesn't charge commission, and revenue from withdrawals is pretty small. However, Huobi probably does make a lot of money off margin trading fees. 
* Huobi gets attacked and DDOS'ed soon after.
edit: This is probably fud. Huobi is the world's largest exchange and they no doubt have more than enough money to pay everyone back. The timing is too convenient, it just happens to get posted right after gox and vircurex insolvencies?? Really?? Huobi is a legitimate and trustworthy exchange IMO, I'm sure this is the last we will hear of it.

Wow, so that article now only has 10 downvotes instead of 50. Does this have something to do with the comments with deleted accounts that are all over that post?

So, call me paranoid but I read a post earlier today on Huobi rumors that got spam downvoted within minutes. 
I myself went on that to post to call obvious FUD, downvote, and give a summary of the announcement:
A few hours later coindesk comes out with this article, and suddenly everyone bashing the last post deleted their usernames??? Are you serious?
I still don't think Huobi is insolvent or anything but everyone should be concerned about these parts of the article:
* The **number of trades executed at that price is unknown, as is the total amount of money lost** – either by the company or by traders who lost due to margin calls. 
* "after a meeting with all stockholders, Huobi has agreed to use a portion of its loan loss provision funds to cover losses suffered by the exchange’s users."
* "Furthermore, the company said, negative balances would be reset to zero – even those still in the red after the 70 RMB redress."
At the very least Huobi should've mentioned how much they lost. The LTC market is small but Huobi provides the liquidity for 2x margins. From what I understand, this means Huobi lost twice as much as their clients, plus they are compensating them as well. So effectively 3x the losses??

so your only proof is a picture of a public tweet. I don't understand the connection. Really reaching here, man.
and unlike you or satoshi, the head of quarkcoin is a public figure, so he can't exactly pump and dump without consequence.
