I'll check it out as soon as I'm on lunch!
@_date: 2014-10-07 10:09:22
I honestly hope this is the case!

The term made me think of a rising crescendo like the "Jaws music". I guess its at least musically possible.

Wow! That is very cool! I'm definitely going to look into beta card! My other debit card it a MasterCard, so maybe I can get away with putting like 10-15% of my extra cash onto there! I'd love to support a technology like this. Things like this are what will make BTC more appealing to the masses!
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:05:59
I've been using litecoin for the same thing. Education. I have sent a few dollars to some people I know with bitcoin as well, but that's usually only if I have no LTC on my phone at the time.
@_date: 2014-08-21 10:14:29
I haven't heard of open bazaar yet, what will be so different about that?
@_date: 2014-11-02 11:38:39
What is the coinbase award? And I have always understood the transaction fee eventually to become the bread and butter of whomever mined the coin initially. Is this not the case? Maybe (probably) I don't understand transaction fees.

How this comment hasn't received gold is beyond me, Much like most things in the crypto world.
@_date: 2014-10-07 13:27:19
That's excellent information! It seems mycelium is making BTC more secure than I last new!
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:17:53
Odd bit of information here, but are you tracking that his name in the game was actually "Crono" as default?
I could be mistaken, but I don't think I am.
@_date: 2014-10-07 10:15:47
Both of those sound like something I don't want to do lol am I missing something?
@_date: 2014-10-23 19:09:12
Inspiring words from @_date: 2014-10-07 10:17:39
That would be cool! I'll move my "profits" to Gabriel's college fund ".
@_date: 2014-10-07 10:16:54
Thank you! I always wanted to be a cowboy! Well, maybe not exactly a cowboy, but this has all the same excitement AND I still get to enjoy toilet paper!
@_date: 2014-10-07 10:11:45
I will create a separate address for this labeled "Gabriel's College Fund". Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-02 19:16:41
That's what they said about Heinz EZ squirt ketchup too! And look! 
@_date: 2014-10-07 21:21:46
I plan on doing that. Honestly I need to reflash my ROM on my phone and then I will probably get mycelium.
What's wrong with coinbase holding them though? Can they not be trusted?
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:44:10
This is true. I'll try to keep an eye on the prices. If anything happens in the next two days though, sadly I can do nothing to buy :(
@_date: 2014-11-02 08:18:50
What are its problems? I legitimately want to know.
@_date: 2014-10-14 19:36:25
I pay about 3.25USD per pack already. I also buy them tax free ;)
@_date: 2014-10-07 09:49:36
Thanks! It was actually pretty difficult for me, because like I said, I have been looking at BTC for a while now, but never confident enough to actually drop USD on it (I am not a rich man). Mostly because I guess I didn't fully understand it (truthfully I'm sure I still don't) and every time I had finally resolved to do it, it had seemed like the price had doubled on me. When BTC jumped up to where it had been recently I was kicking myself for not actually buying in all those times I thought about it instead of "waiting for it to go back down".
That's why I set a price limit for myself, and decided that's where I would jump in at.
@_date: 2014-10-30 21:05:39
I don't keep up with BTC news much these days. Do you mean to tell me the inventor of BTC made himself known?
@_date: 2014-10-07 04:24:31
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:15:07
Did it not do this already? How will I know?
@_date: 2014-10-14 19:55:30
I see what you did there. Cancer jokes and such. 
@_date: 2014-11-02 08:17:02
Moved to fiber? I do that every night, in my dreams.
@_date: 2014-10-23 19:11:46
Can I have a handout if I just ask for one upfront?
@_date: 2014-10-07 10:14:38
Thanks, Chrono! (I really hope your name is a ChronoTrigger reference, that game was amazing!)
@_date: 2014-11-02 09:38:14
How would this help? That sounds like a death blow to BTC to me. I really want to hear why you say this.
Wouldn't with the current difficulty and all, you basically NEED those 50 million jiggawatt industrial mines to eek out a whole bitcoin? (Obvious exaggerating should be obvious.) 
Like, for it to go back to what I would call "decentralized mining" wouldn't the difficulty have to drop back down quite a bit?
And even if it did, then would it even still be profitable to mine new coins using cheap rigs that would I'm assuming have to be sold off to these now dead industrial mines?
Like, sure they MAYBE were doing OK at 50 jiggawatts from one source, but how many can you expect to get at 1 jiggawatt? Would it even be worth it? 
I realize I'm using fantastical terms here, but that's mostly because I don't want to use the wrong actual terminology and conversions and have that be the focal point of my question instead of having the logic behind me questioning answered.
@_date: 2014-11-02 08:11:08
I almost never click "follow this thread" but hot damn that was one hell of a tempting one. I was in turn disappointed.
@_date: 2014-10-07 04:24:20
I'm just keeping a little on my moto x for right now using the Coinbase wallet. That's the plan anyway. I don't plan on go crazy with it. One: Because I don't have money to invest like that. Two: I just want to show my friends and my son when he can understand.
I'm using authy and a strong PW. 
Thank you for the message! I was really hoping people would see this post! I like what you bitcoiners seem to be about and thought my little endeavor might help take your minds off the current plummet.
Edit: I also want to try it out as a currency! Somehow that didn't get in my reasons up top.
@_date: 2014-10-07 10:10:42
Hey! Thank you! My first dollar of BTC!
@_date: 2014-10-07 13:11:32
Thank you! I am almost up to 2 USD worth of BTC now! 
Take that Coinbase with your two day verification time!
@_date: 2014-10-07 11:53:35
I don't think I trust myself just yet. I do intend on playing with some other wallets, I downloaded the coinbase one from the play store, but I'm going to go ahead and assume they still will be kept on coinbase's storage. Right? 
I don't know much about paper wallets and even less about the backups. Aren't bitcoins supposed to not be able to be "copied"?
I'll definitely be doing my own research, but as of now I'm just stoked to be in a position to break into the bitcoin world.
@_date: 2014-10-14 20:50:40
Z. I can agree with that. I was mostly mentioning Doge as a joke (the way it was intended, really).

Haha, I must have said that wrong, huh? Because I'm pretty sure you guys don't like the whale bear.
@_date: 2014-11-02 19:11:50
All right, calm down. I was simply surprised nobody else had yet. it has been gilded.
@_date: 2013-08-15 12:23:14
How does BTC tax evasion work?
@_date: 2013-04-22 00:39:25
Thats what i was thinking too. I wish i knew about btc when it was 26usd/btc. I envy those guys.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:58:10
You would do that?! *GASP*
@_date: 2013-08-15 22:16:53
Ah. Very nice. What about when you sell them for fiat? Or do you use them soley for goods/resellables?
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:56:16
I was checking it out and was wondering what your opinion of going the pool route was. I'm mostly just trying to get my toes wet and understand this. Mostly as a new sort of hobby I guess would be the best way to describe it.
@_date: 2013-04-22 10:37:59
Thank you for this well thought out reply. I'm reaaly only considering it since i got into the mining game kinda late, and as you saix, it would probably be my funding for Btc.
@_date: 2013-04-21 20:48:04
Yea. I kinda figured that out but still appreciate the answer. Would investing in an ASIC be worth it in your opinion?
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:29:31
Thank you! Once my transaction goes through I think I know exactly who I'm tipping first ;)
@_date: 2013-08-15 12:21:48
Relevant. 
@_date: 2013-08-04 22:11:13
Nice. Ive actually been wanting to make the switch to a linux distribution. I've been looking into bt5r3 and kali, since I REALLY want to get into netsec.
@_date: 2013-04-22 00:30:43
Those are some very good points. On the subject of other currency, what are your thoughts on litecoin?
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:36:22
Here in the states it was originally about a certain friday when the stock market crashed. Lots of suicide. Must have something to do with low prices we pay now.. in a sick sort of way.
 
@_date: 2013-08-04 19:53:17
Glad I'm a ..fuck.. I don't do any of that.
What is noscript?
By *nix is that just like any linux flavor?
@_date: 2013-04-22 00:38:00
Yes, I intend it mostly as a hobby to deter the "gold fever " I've heard of.
