widespread adoption will grow organically, i believe people will use it without even knowing they are using it, think a prtocol like https or ipv4, the masses dont understand the intricacies but know it works and use it daily, i believe that is the future of btc, price wise im waiting for the dips ;)
oh and NO they cant shut it down just make it illegal but its world wide and distributed Peer to Peer so like torrents have survivied so will btc always survive imo

once you broadcast to the network you are fine you can turn off your computer
private keys are your actual coins, or rather the back end key you should only be in control of that proves you are the sole owner of the btc address or what is really a hashed publick key
the 3$ fee is because of recent full blocks and flood of tx's so higher fees take priority for miners to include into blocks

yes fiat will fluctuate your coin will not unless spent or otherwise, btc is slowly becoming deflationary due to rising scarcity and demand meaning the money itself is not designed to be devalued by continual inflation of the currency supply aka dollars 
its never too late to take the plunge i have been around since early 2012 and have sold a many all time highs, i see btc at 1 million $ eadch or 100 $ within next 20 years, but remeber, at any price, it still fucking works

Fiat it latin that means by government decree
all money that exists today euros dollars yen etc are FIAT, because they are issued by governements not by nature like silver or gold or nowadays btc
btc gold silver are not
