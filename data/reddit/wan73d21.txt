Nigga where did you buy bitcoin in 2007 ?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:02:47
You're right. It does look pretty good. Thank you for the response. I think I'm gonna hodl the btc i already have.But I'm thinking about spending 2k eur more and idk if I should buy right now or keep it in case of a dip. Also I got 2 eth and I'm thinking about trading it for btc... my head is a mess.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:11:09
You're always a late buyer.

Bro I just sold a while ago at 15k...
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:31:30
Bought 500 EUR at 6.5k usd/btc and 2.5k EUR at 14.3k usd/btc but I would have bought the 2.5k eur when it was 7.5k usd/btc if it wasnt for the goddamn sepa long time transfer.About to buy 2.5k more EUR if it gets a dip or if it reaches above 18k USD.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:39:32
I wanted to buy at 13.5k but what the fuck happened from 13k to 14k I just left my phone for a minute and when I checked it went from goddamn  13k to 14k. So I bought only at 14k...

Nah man. My buy in spot was at 14.3 k so I still made a profit of 300 EUR. If I would have sold at 19k I would have had a 1.5k profit
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:32:49
That's actually a good point. The support of the product is critical... but who knows how long is the support gonna last. Even though we might lose support from the official providers of the ledger after a while we could still have support from the community so here is another question... do you think the ledger has wider community support than trezor or is it the other way around?

@_date: 2017-12-11 03:34:32
I currently have 0.27 and 2.500 EUR ready to use them for the dip. I was about to take out  the 0.27btc so I can buy on the dip more but I've made my peace with hodling the 0.27 and keep just the 2.5k in case a dip happens. You should take out half and leave half.

Do you usually buy gradually a specific amount of your funds as the bitcoin price goes down or do you buy with all the funds and sell all btc ?
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:31:57
I'm using a chinese smart watch that has a high vibration intensity that it's  linked with at least 3 crypto market check apps on my phone and whenever btc or eth gets to my desired target my smart watch vibrates and gives me a notification. Many times I woke up at 4 am because of it and I am thankful because I didn't miss the targets. It's the closest thing you got for now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:49:35

Just checked the preorder page and it's sold out. Anyways It looks like the last Trezor didn't support ripple and I don't know if the new one will support it so I think I am going with the ledger.

Don't say why. lol. Or at least make a believable lie so people actually sell.

@_date: 2017-12-22 16:56:44
Sending this to all my friends that bought at 18 -19k and are still hodling. Im a good friend.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:08:44
If you wanna buy you should do it on Bitstamp. They got one of the lowest prices atm.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:41:50
Well it depends how you buy. I personally do it with credit card since I get the desired bitcoin amount instantly. With sepa transfers it takes around 3-5 working days to deposit the money.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:35:56
And your mom calls you 2 days after to tell you what happened with bitcoin because she saw it on the news. Then you feel like you've been to the fucking future.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:36:05
I know I am... it's gonna be a fun and sleepless weekend being on cryptowatch the whole time. Let's just hope the drunk ones sell so we can buy cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:58:27
Do this: 
Tell your friend/bro/sis/wife/dog to hit you (or bite you) the next time they see you check bitcoins value. I know, its incredibly fucking hard to stay away from it... but you have to. You know why ? Because you're only cutting off some years of your life. Check the value of your amount only after 2 weeks/1 month and you will taste what getting into btc is all about.

@_date: 2017-12-21 22:48:45
So did I. Bought about 2.5k more worth when it was at 15.3 a few hours ago. When it reaches 19k gonna sell again because the same story is gonna happen.... and in case it doesn't drop and reaches 21k im getting in again.

Got into the dip and bought at 15.3k. After it reaches 18-19 im gonna sell again because the same story is gonna happen. If it reaches 20.5 or 21k im buying again.

Less than a day on sepa ? Where the hell do you live ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:26:08
I know its always going up but i am currently thinking about selling and buying tomorrow depending on the chances that there will be a hard drop (that obviously won't last long)
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:35:36
Thank you so much...that makes a lot of sense. At the moment I will put 50% at 12.5k$ then 25% at 11.5k$ and 25% at 10.5k$. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:43:42
Honestly you should get used to high fees (even expect a continuous rise of them). When dealing with this volatile currency the fees are just some pocket change. What really matters is dealing with a trusted exchange. Anyways the bitstamp fees are high (about 5%-8%) but I personally think it is a trustworthy exchange despite some of the reviews I've seen around. I currently have bought about 7k with them but that is my experience. I cannot speak for everybody else unless some of them confirm it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:04:55
You were right. Got out at 12.7k and about to get on the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:00:25
Never lol. He's jobless.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:05:45
Bro im in the same fucking spot and im dying a little day by day. Wanted to buy on the 29'th when it was about 9k but with the fucking sepa i only got my money on Monday and thought i hold a little until the weekend since that's when the price usually drops a little but it gets on my nerves knowing i could have bought on monday for about 10.9 and right now idk if i should buy at 14k or wait till the weekend. FUCK MY LIFE.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:07:12
Do you think there will be a drop tomorrow ? Would you sell right now and buy tomorrow if there is a chance of a drop ?
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:08:53
I thought so but the amount it dropped doesn't seem right. Usually (from my perspective) when corrections happened on btc they tend to be a little more aggressive than this.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:29:25
Currently in the same situation. Holding half in BTC and half in Eur BUT I am currently thinking about selling now and buying tomorrow if there is going to be a hard drop. I heard from some people that the situation from tomorrow might affect BTC in a bad way and it might drop it's value for a small time.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:07:57
Im never gonna look at the decrease arrow the same way.

Buying/selling 100% of my funds has actually been my play the whole time ever since I got into btc (which is not long ago) Ive always wanted to try the method you are referring to but I have trouble coming up with HOW MUCH % of my total amount I should use on every partial buy from my funds and AT WHAT POINTS I should buy... Let's say for example I want to buy from a total of 5680 EUR. What would you recommend ?

I don't know man, my head is a mess. I've currently put 3k eur into btc when it was a few days ago 14.3k usd and i am willing to put 2.5k eur more into btc but I currently have 3 options:
a) Sell all my btc and hope there will be a hard drop tomorrow so that i buy all i can with 5k eur.
b) Leave it as it is and if there is a drop I will buy from the remaining 2.5k eur i am willing to buy but regret that I didn't sell and bought when it was 14.3k usd for 3k eur.
 Or the last one...
c) Buy right now all the btc i can with the remaining 2.5k eur and expect it does not drop tomorrow.
I need to find out exactly how will the agreements from tomorrow affect BTC... if it will drop or if it will stay/rise.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:15:48
For a hot wallet go with Green Address. But before you do any transactions make sure to disable the "Network Upgrades" and keep segwit enabled. Many people (I didn't know at first either) don't know this but that feature is enabled from the start as a default setting and it  takes a higher fee from any transaction because it gets you more confirmations and faster than the traditional way but it is not worth it unless you are an active trader so make sure to disable it before you send the btc to your wallet. It is also really secure and has a multi platform that includes mobile app, browser extension etc.
As much as a cold wallet hardware device goes im not really familiar with them but from what i gathered Trezor seems to be an eye catching device for many people. I was recommended this one a lot.

The thing is that wire transfers to gdax from banks that are in Romania (my country) are not available. From what i can gather only us accounts are eligible for wire transfers. And SEPA transactions are out of the equation because its takes too long and i need to buy ASAP...If the fees do not surpass 10% in total i am ok with it. But im more scared of the fact that they won't let me send my btc to my wallet and give me bogus about verification etc...even though im verified with bank statement, driving license etc...
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:31:28
