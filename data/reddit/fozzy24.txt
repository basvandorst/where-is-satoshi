A month is super short term. You are EXTREMELY naive if you believe that’s longterm.
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:01:12
Ah you of short sightedness
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:36:24
New investor and I’m HODL. Got to think longterm and years in advance at not panic. Can’t say the same for others tho lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:01:53
Oh I can tell fam but yeah I personally hope it doesn’t for my sake I may be tempted to buy more haha
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:39:38
Ah yes because there are so many people like that and what makes you think it’s “overbought”? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:36:24
Yep. I had been doing months of research before I bought at what I thought was the dip at $16k, got to learn about what you’re buying.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:30:49
Check his post history ���� these accounts have me weak
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:40:17
HODL on brother 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:36:00
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:02:52
Oh no whatever will people do when it’s +72% on the month. The absolute horror! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:42:06
Yeah that’s short term thinking my man. Short term? Yes it will like it is rn. Long term it’s gonna be better than BCH. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:45:38
BCH seems like a sham but Ver and all those guys to me. BTC has more prestige and is more widely known if than BCH and will outlive and outpace it. BCH is the hypebeast rn and has the hype but I believe personally it’s a Flash in the pan type crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:53:46
4 $5 pizzas from Little Ceasers ahem
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:35:32
Preach brotha. I’m mad. I didn’t wait so I could buy lower but all well lol.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:44:36
What’s the point of this thread 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:42:13
Why sell now exactly? It’s +65% on the month and you are buying into the dumb narrative it’s crashing. Congrats on the profit tho
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:33:42
Very true. Hopefully the fees issue can be dealt with soon to allow more usage than storing of value 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:05:26
A function of currency is being a store of value....
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:13:29
What’s your player type? I just started my career (soooooooo good this year) and am a 7”2 300 LB slashing rebounding center and I LOVE IT. Such a great type. I’m only 65 overall but he’s a beast and I can’t wait to upgrade him. If you’re on Xbox lmk!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:36:38
It’s a lot to me as a college student dude but I get your point. That $20 goes a longggg way lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:26:20
Same but I’m not panicking like everyone else is lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:46:37
Oh I know it’s a big difference my man just saying in my case $20 is a decent amount. I feel horrible for everyone who put that much in. Hope they HODL and stay in and don’t panic and be smart here
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:22:40
I mean you’re talking to one right now. I bought in at $16.8k this week at $100 which is a lot for a college student. People are overreacting and need to learn not to panic.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:45:16
I don’t think it’s gonna go much cheaper than this but to each your own
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:52:39
Fair enough but I’m personally not a fan of BCH
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:40:15
Its literally two weeks later lol shortsighted much
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:28:30
Whew thank god Sathosi didn’t 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:37:52
But I thought these threads are accurate in their sub 10k predictions though, right?? /s
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:41:30
Oh yeah i just have to offer my advice as a person who bought in after researching for a quite some time and has the optimism that many people who have been around longer lack.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:38:14
It’s +65% on the month.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:34:26
How exactly is it not a correction care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:25:08
Y’all all need to chill and not overreact. You buy in for be long con and not get rich quick. Be patient and HODL. Fuck GDAX and Coinbase. I bought in at $16.8k or along those lines and y’all don’t see me panicking.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:07:41
Same boat 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:27:31
I didn’t mean to type healthy I should have put expected but you get my point. I’m halfass typing rn while playing 2K.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:15:47
I bought $30 more after reading this. BUY BUY BUY
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:42:59
Thank you so much for all the info fam. Which would you recommend best bang for your buck? I’d get a Trezor or the other one you recommended but that would outweigh my current amount of BTC (college student or I’d own more). Paper wallet as you said is probably cheapest but so inconvenient lol. Thanks so much again!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:32:59
It’s +62% this month so try again bud. It’s a correction and not a pop.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:30:50
I’d advise getting into BTC now. I’ve been following this for quite some time and i finally caved today after the dip from the coinbase snafu and Bitcoin Cash being introduced on the app. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:35:42
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:24:59
Same! How much for you? I don’t have a ton to throw around since holiday shopping and such and being in college but I threw in another $30
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:12:24
As a broke college student I want to buy in but I can’t with insurance rates going up cause I got in an accident last week ughhhhhhh 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:07:26
Amen to that!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:47:01
Yep! Education is extremely important, but it is expensive to say the least lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:43:38
This looks like a great option tbh
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:19:24
It’s +67% on the month ffs it’s a fucking healthy correction
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:27:09
It’s a correction not a pop ffs 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:43:22
If I wasn’t a college student and owned more BTC I’d go with this lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:46:57
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:20
IM NOT MAKING 100% GAINS A DAY THIS IS RUBBISH I SAY!11!!1!! /s
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:33:25
Yeah I misspoke thanks for the correction bby
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:40:23
Same ugh
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:53:27
Yep in the general populace this won’t look good for BTC to say the least
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:29:14
Most people will panic and regret it later after they sell, sadly you’re right in this matter lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:39:46
Love you too 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:37:37
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:37:23
Just $100 all I could afford as a college student. I have more money obv but I don’t want to throw all of it into BTC and I need to save for some things next year.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:21:15
It’s cause this BCH shit and Ver being a shit. It’s up 67% on the month and this is a HEALTHY correction. Everyone is overreacting 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:45:40
Yeah I get the convenience of the app but then again it’s probably best to go with something more secure online and just track it on your phone. Security and less shenanigans&gt;convenience
