Atleast for the ones who don't have racks of 50 Th/s Miners. The ones that do make enough profit to pay the expense. 
I have been researching the bitcoin mining all night. I am trying to see if I can be convinced to invest.

Well only if Bitcoin was well known.
 There's people today in america that are still not aware of Bitcoin. Idk hdk many people in africa know of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 23:54:45
One Word: **Epiphany** 
This is Huge. I read some very interesting articles supporting everything it is that you've said. Amazing to look at Bitcoins this way, I never have.
Being that, at this time, Blockchain is the most prominent thing behind Bitcoins global attraction through the media, it leads me to question a few things, in order to confidently understand what exactly is to come..
Is Blockchain, something separate to Bitcoin, but used only as a platform, **or**, is Blockchain, indefinitely, Bitcoin?
Another way to ask: Does Blockchain live without bitcoin, or, are they, in reality, both, one?
@_date: 2015-12-19 03:49:22

Hold them. We still haven't seen anything yet.
@_date: 2015-12-17 17:34:57
Well, to answer one of your questions. Ethereum has grouped and joined the Bitcoin blockchain already. Meaning they work as one.
@_date: 2015-12-20 19:56:14
I think if I was to invest it would be 1K more, if anything. Just as you just posted, I wouldn't want to invest all of my savings. But the amount of BTC should give a great profit when this thing goes.
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:11:27
Good stuff with your average. The last  2.5 Years of BTC have been the most important, consider yourself a pioneer. Most knew nothing of Bitcoin at that time. I got 9 when they where $5 and missed the chance to sell at $1,200 (thinking it would rise higher) then used them. But I know it will surpass the ATH, its the only thing that makes sense with the past Year and a half being at a complete standstill. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 18:55:46
Blockchain needs to be a slide. Also a slide speaking on why so many banks are partnering up in order to cotrol the success of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-17 06:14:49
Hmm.. Thats sounds right. Maybe the took the precaution in order to make sure there'd be no speculations, with the amount also being forged. 
Good eye!
@_date: 2015-12-22 23:07:39
I will tell you that I, myself, believe Bitcoin is **going** to rise in value. 
I am very confident it will rise, but this is because of my experience with the charts and Bitcoin itself. Was confident (and still am) enough to have invested 5K, last week.
The only thing I can say is, if you are financially stable, no debt, settled, and have more than just the 10K, then I'd say go for it. 
But, you're going to have to be okay, mentally, with at times seeing your BTC value decrease. 
The price is $430 and I don't think you would lose anything at this point, it would only rise. 
Make the decision yourself! Do not let what I just said or others make financial decisions for you. 
Goodluck dude!
@_date: 2015-12-26 17:17:15
Hmm. I'm trying to figure it out also. Only thing I see in the chart is the price slowly going downwards. 
I'm not on a PC. So I'm not able to connect what made the price drop. 
Can anyone let me know if china has released any news on Bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:49:13
Why did you buy 8 of those?
They have a 50TH/s for **$5,200.00**!
You could have bought 2x of them and been mining .2 - .4 BTC a day.
@_date: 2015-12-17 00:11:56


Fingers Crossed! After seeing how everything has gone in the past it only makes me believe the future in bitcoins will aspire. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 05:34:41


So you must have not read the post..
@_date: 2015-12-22 22:16:34
I didn't see this.. but its crazy you say this. You have **no idea** I have not slept because of this being the sole purpose. Was my, very, first time looking into bitcoin mining.
I found some great stuff. Near the end of my research I found the 50 TH/s that sells for 5K (An awesome value) and was preparing to buy. But then I started researching how the difficulty fluctuates and am seeing that it can jump to a very high percentage out of nowhere, leaving you to mine less BTC. 
Idk yet. I would like to know what your thought on all of that was. 
Btw, thanks for the Tip. Very first time seeing this feature.
@_date: 2015-12-24 00:21:47
Localbitcoins.com, You can trade locally using cash.
@_date: 2015-12-19 03:33:47
Please use those sources. Study them extensively. You will then see what I am talking about. I bought $5K worth of BTC a few days back and cannot seem to stop studying this. 
To point out another thing, and this one really pisses me off. Last night the U.S. made more trades at around this time 9:30-11 P.M. than any other time, and it was solely because CNY was just waking up and trading at very high volumes around 5-6A.M., their time. 
That mindset is the reason behind the hold up in the price and barrier brake. 
**We need to mirror what China does in their own Daylight time, and do it in our own daylight time** to create a supporting trade volume that can have the stable growing system for the price to reach the numbers it needs to, because once this price reach THE NUMBER, the price is going to rocket. Its a magic number we need to hit. You will know of the number, when that time comes, the whole media will speak one it once it is that we reach the number.

Thank you! 
Is there anything you know about the $500 and the 'whale' conversations going on? 
@_date: 2015-12-19 03:24:17
I am heavily studying the BTC charts, volumes, prices and trades. I use, mainly, fiatleak.com directly with  The  reason I have bitcoinwisdom.com open to the CNY market is because its the most important.
Can also use bitcoincharts.com 
I can tell you that, by what I have been seeing the, price will rise overnight to $468 possibly even above $470. What we are doing is trying to brake the barrier that we keep hitting but not getting through. The reason we have not broke through is SOLELY because of US. I mean us as in the United States currency. China at its time of rest (2:00A.M. Lights out, no cars on the street) still maintains to do MORE trades than we do at our PEAK hour (12 - 3P.M) We are holding it back. The only way the price will blow up is if we piggy back off of the value raise that China creates and keep the trades volume up while they are at rest. Its sad, because I am looking at proof that if china wasn't doing what they are doing now, consistently, there would be nothing on the news to talk about. 
Edit(10:14  US CST): Price may not reach my expection. China is not trading at high volumes today. Do not know the reason behind this. If someone could inform me of why they believe this is, it would be great.
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:15:46
 I heard coinbase.com is good. I purchased with cash through LocalBitcoins.com. Found a guy selling at same average BTC price.

Not that hard to believe.. you yourself stated that there is not one person who has the answer..?
@_date: 2015-12-16 21:11:04
I don't think you got the memo where I requested to be treated fairly.. I'd appreciate it, if you would not leave unwanted comments, specially if its not relevant to my post.. I asked a question and you replied with asking questions..

1. No, it is not what I asked.
2. No. I am being serious.
@_date: 2015-12-23 00:58:50
Well.. I guess I'm an expert guys (:
@_date: 2015-12-14 03:34:10
This is very great stuff here. I never would have thought nor would I have speculated that the price hike was forged or unlegitimate. I thought it was normal. 
Can I ask if you have invested in BTC again, being that you have known this?
Is this information cause for any concerns regarding BTC and specifically investing in it (even though it made 'those' that kne a lot of money)? 
@_date: 2015-12-21 00:01:18
Circle, I have not used either. I do know its much newer (not to say its nit safe or trusted) than coinbase but do see people reviewing them well. 
Maybe try a small transaction first, before the real buy?
Also, its not a problem! Welcome.
@_date: 2015-12-19 05:33:02
Huge Buy Raises Value. Huge Sale lowers is. Https:// shows you exactly how many BTC would need to be bought to reach a price, vice versa.
@_date: 2015-12-26 01:01:33
Some of the guys here are saying the things a scam. I myself was going to buy this machine but after hearing this I don't think I will be mining anymore as this was the only thing that would have made it worth my money.
@_date: 2015-12-16 22:24:53
Great stuff! My first time looking into the back-end of the trading volume. Its looking good. 
I invested $5,000 yesterday, through localbitcoins, actually.
Do you believe we will, soon, see Bitcoin reach $600+?
My opinion is **it should**, I mean.. logically, it only makes sense.
 Bitcoin, at a point, has gone from $70's, to $150's, to $440's, reaching $1,200 **all in a very, very short amount of time**. For it to drop, instantaneously, to extreme lows, stay at a standstill **for over 1^1/2 Year's, suddenly to begin moving, in a very similar fashion to how it did, at the time of the price boom**, it tells me that it HAS to be because it will reach the previous high, or even exceed it.. 
My brain is not allowing me to think otherwise.
*Sorry if I seem to be coming off too strong, very passionate about this entire thing*

Some guys are going to say your wrong.. But I can understand entirely why this molested you enough to the point you stopped holding with them. It is an inappropriate question to ask, especially with it being directly related to your money.

People like you shouldn't even be welcomed in this Sub Reddit..
What problems are you guys trying to stir up?
If you want to post things that are 'BITCOIN CLASSIC' related, find yourself the Sub reddit to do so! 
**This is r/Bitcoin! (anything unrelated, directly, to BITCOIN would be a post in the wrong sub reddit)**
How the hell is this so hard to understand. I stand with u/theymos. He is doing what he should. 
Take it to r/bitcoin_classic, r/cryptocurrency!
You guys must really have no hope for your idea if you feel the need to come to the BITCOIN community, which does not approve, to promote it. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 05:15:18
Yeah man. Mining these things isn't how it used to be. The profit does not come easy. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 22:42:24
The biggest reason would be the fee they have to pay VISA, Master card, AMEX, etc.. it would all go directly to them if they had Bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2016-01-20 02:15:58
They are still sending these out? Thought they gave up..
@_date: 2016-01-16 06:35:41
No problem. Its not as common, some neighborhoods do not have a local Walmart near them to take advantage of their service. 
Fortunately, the process is not like that. Walmart 2 Walmart exchange takes place in the Customer Service section, you fil out a money sending form (as you would with Moneygram) and that would be all! 
It is a very simple process.
@_date: 2016-01-16 06:18:55
I mean.. I believe that they also do the Moneygram services in their store but, no, they should still be having their Walmart 2 Walmart service available at all their locations. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:50:13
Don't they have limits? I'm also looking to buy near this amount but with cash. Localbitcoins isn't offering any good rates ATM -_-
@_date: 2016-01-02 04:13:10
You would never know until you actually put it up. Thing is its costly.. if I was you i'd partner up with LibertyX first, to get the feel.
@_date: 2016-01-16 04:00:17
You wanting them, actually makes your possibility less with them wanting you. You have to make them need you for them to want you.

If this is real, and you are the winner, I will speak for the entire community, in saying that you would be forever appreciated if you could publicly announce to the media that Bitcoin is something you will be/have been making great investments in.
Again, if this is real, I would not be able to answer your question being that I have never had this problem, but, I can't see how explaining yourself to Coinbase directly would not allow for exceptions to be made, for this special circumstance. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 21:37:38

Localbitcoins.com has systems in place to assist in making sure things go well. 
I couldn't tell you exactly how the online trades goes. 
Trading locally is what I did and found it to be a simple, smooth process. 
You'd start with finding your trading partner (do your due-diligence), meet them and complete the trade. 
The way they ensure that both parties have a successful trade is by LocalBTC providing a secret code to the buyer, that same code the buyer ends up using to make sure the seller in fact has sent the Bitcoins. 
Trade goes like this: 
You meet the seller -&gt; show and confirm your form of payment-&gt; seller sends payment -&gt; verify transaction by asking for the security code (Confirm its the same you have been given) -&gt; provide payment to seller -&gt; check BTC wallet -&gt; Transaction complete.

BTC price going up (:
@_date: 2016-01-16 06:58:03
Yeah, I am late. Was released 6 months ago. I consider it relevant, being that in early 2015 BTC did not have much buzz, its great to see the production have enough faith in BTC to open the movie with that line, on a shot that could have very well been taken a year prior to the release date (where matters were even worse for BTC)..
Overall super happy to have heard it in such a big movie and it being the opening line is great. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 20:57:04
Hey u/pixelesmario,
Just a heads up, asking for Bitcoins is against this sub reddits rule.

Its actually very easy. There are services like libertyx.com, localbitcoins.com which allow you to buy bitcoins using cash, locally.
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:55:50
You're right. 
I'm looking at it like this:
At this point everyone is taking a loss with how things are going, and it is on its way to getting worse.. 
I see myself holding most my finances in Bitcoin as **the best chance** to end up winning.. if it doesn't go as planned I will just be in the same circumstance that, this economy, has millions of people in, already. 
At the end of the day guys. Things are getting worse day by day. The truth, and severity of this matter have not been publicised. Its the only thing saving everything from going to crap.
@_date: 2016-01-04 20:22:41
I'm excited. This should be great marketing for BTC. I just hope it is all clean and professional in order for it to get accepted properly.

I feel safe knowing that my money is with me, accessible, available, at any given time. If in any case I need it for personal use or a simple emergency, I know its there. I am the type of person who needs to have all control of my finances. Which is why when you compare the 2, I prefer holding cash over keeping it in the bank. 
Bonds and ETF's is not something I am very experienced with. I would imagine that investing in Bonds, ETF's would not leave me a simple way to take my investments out in a timely manner. 
BTC I've been familiar with for years.. I become comfortable, excited, secure, when the word comes up. Its something I feel as if I understand.. it gives me a sense of a welcomed space. I see also the potential it has, in the increase in value, which would be another reward aside from all the other perks their is from having BTC. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 04:45:20
I wouldn't sell all of it. What do you need all that money at once for anyways..? 
Selling 50-100 seems more ideal to me. You being in the game long enough to rack up 500BTC tells me you should know this.
Anyways, its your money. Do as you please

From what I know.. they cannot change anything solely. I think the thing is that they make a minor change in the bitcoin blockchain coding (which is public) and then if 51% of people using Bitcoin Blockchain follow/adopt the protocol it then becomes the main Form of the Primary Bitcoin blockchain. 
Can someone let me know if I kind of understand it right?

He is actually being way too chill about the situation. That is his $7,000.00. He has not received the transfer made on the 16th, and being that the only people who can give him an answer as to why, have yet to reply back within a reasonable time frame, is more than enough of a reason to be upset, even beyond. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:23:22
Lol. If only anyone knew... I am, right now, asking myself the same. I want to buy $5K worth at this price. Then sell the 11BTC I bought at $460, when price rises back to it. Thing is, it all could change overnight.. China is asleep atm. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:44:20

Not a Bitcoin exchange term, or idea. It is a money transfer service that Walmart offers in which you send money from one Walmart to another Walmart, at a different location. It is a competitor of the exchange service called MoneyGram. The competition comes from Walmart having a, significantly, lower service fee.

Mycellium is a Bitcoin wallet application that also offers a feature where you can create a listing, just as one would do on localbitcoins, but I doubt that there would be anyone selling there if your having trouble finding people on localbitcoins.com.

If this really is what he is doing I'd have to say it's pretty smart. He really isn't a bad guy, take a look at some of his interviews; The medications price that he raised is all payed by the health insurance of the clients, in case their is someone in need who cannot afford the medication he offers a program that automatically offers the medicine for free.
