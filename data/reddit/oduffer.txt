Fair comment. There's a lot less money in it than I can afford to lose. Free money at the moment. Bail out probably... This is a separate account from my HODL anyway. If you believe as I do the BTC is the future you'd be stupid not to. Stick your beer money in at the start of the month and watch it increase by the hour. I know coinbase are not popular, and skim a couple of percent, but spending free money feels good man lol

I guess the price of graphics cards is going to go up again?!

If you can limit yourself to £700 a week, get a coinbase card and go mad.

Coinbase debit card is great, Bitcoin has paid for my drinks all day. It's like having a bank balance that never goes down only up �� If you're in the UK just get one and stick some cash in.

Where do the transaction fees paid go to? One individual?
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:35:01

[Disc Rot]( is real.

Not true for all banking apps. The Barclays app has a 6 digit pin I need to re-enter even if I 'background' the app
