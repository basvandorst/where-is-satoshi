But I guess that's where the controversy comes from, its that implication that the slavery mindset was a choice for actual slaves, when that was their reality unlike today. He may not have meant it that way, but that's how his argument came across.

But this:


And this: 


Are referencing two different groups of people.  
  
 You can tell because the first statement he's using the past tense "were" and in the second he's using the present tense "we're (we are)". "You *were* there for 400 years....sounds like a choice", he's saying that the slaves made the choice to remain slaves for that long,  he's referencing past slaves directly. And in the second part he's referencing people today being "we're...mentally in prison" meaning people today use slavery as a way to create a victim mentality, or a "mental prison". That direct reference using the past tense was him saying slaves chose to remain slaves, anything he says much later after the fact is him just trying to cover his ass imo.

If slavery in the US only lasted about 200 years and the US is only about 250 years old, how does the 400 years number make any sense at all in this context?

But if being a slave is involuntary, doesn't that prove the point that there is no choice?

That's not at all what he's saying, the quote is "Like, you were there for 400 years"...who was there? Slaves were there for 400 years, its a direct reference to the people of the past 400 years whom were slaves. And the "its all of you all?", the "all" he is referencing is the slaves he mentioned in the beginning of the sentence. He's pretty clear in his language there.  
  
 And what he says after is him pointing out that there remains a slave mentality in this country today even though blacks are free, and that they shouldn't continue that mentality. Which is a whole different argument all together.

But the "prison mindset" doesn't make sense because they were actually slaves, it wasn't just a mindset. So for him to say it "sounds like a choice", is incredibly ignorant.  Like if they just had the right mindset they wouldn't have been slaves.

That wasn’t my conclusion. It was a separate point that I think he started backtracking immediately because he knew he said some ignorant shit. And it’s not “truth” it’s **literally** just his opinion.

No leaps at all, pretty simple stuff here bud, try to keep up.

The US has only been a country for ~250 years, so I agree his numbers make no sense at all, and that even extends to your argument "to the present day", the numbers are just way off. I really think it just shows how ignorant Kayne is on the subject and how maybe we should be taking his words so seriously to begin with. Nonetheless his words have consequences regardless of how misinformed they are, so here we are talking about it.

So pretty much any recommended hardware wallet would be better than keeping them on an exchange?

So i have a question. If the value of bitcoin is partially reliant on miners what happens to the value of bitcoin after all coin have been mined? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:13:50
Thats assuming people are buying it for the tech. Most people buying bitcoin today aren't doing so to use it as a currency, more so to make a quick buck basically treating it like a stock. I'm 100% with you that it will eventually crash, but I have a feeling it wont be anytime soon as more people learning about bitcoin will want to invest in it.

Is that before or after all those wall street bonuses finally hit the market?

Be careful going all in, sharp pumps in price like this usually have sharp pull backs as well. You should wait for the price to stabilize after the dip occurs and up your position then if you still want to.
