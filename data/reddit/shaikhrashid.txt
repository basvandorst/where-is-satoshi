Not sure, but bittylicious.com is an excellent company. I can recommend them and have bought bitcoins from them before.

This is great, but we know it's going to keep happening until something happens to fix it.

If I have an wallet on Blockchain.info, which I have a public and private address for. Am I then able to import this wallet into a different web wallet without doing anything on Blockchain.info?

Edit: Very possible I did something wrong here also!

Could someone explain this Bitcoin wall?

* Bitcoin is digital money, that can be transferred as easily as sending an email 
* Bitcoin has no leader, it's a set of rules that everyone has agreed to follow
* Bitcoins are created as a reward to users, who offer there computing power to verify and record payments. These users are called miners
* Bitcoins will stop being created after 21 millions coins are made. This makes Bitcoins worth more over time
* Bitcoins are accepted by businesses because transaction fees are much less than those imposed by credit card companies. More profit, better value!
* Bitcoins are easier and more secure than cash. No annoying leftover change, less risk of loosing your coins if you get mugged 
* Bitcoins is the internet of money!
EDIT: Oh sweet JESUS
[Thanks for the gold!](

Thank you so much [u/cflag]( [u/ninja_parade]( and [u/usrn]( for your kind donations! 
Honestly it means a lot, and I'll definitely pass it on when I'm able too!
One of the reasons I love Bitcoin was because Andreas talked about this culture of generosity in the community. 
I feel *so* excited about Bitcoin and all it's potential! 
Also thanks for everyone who answered my questions. I feel like an expert, although I know I'm not =). I plan on reading up on mining, and how it works next! It sounds fascinating.  
@_date: 2014-04-29 14:55:32
Thanks! 
Yes, I agree. I think it's been a little overused in the past. Changed!

Thanks very much, for future reference these tips didn't come through, u/dogetipbot shows my balance as 0 doge, and u/cointip also shows it as 0.
Its the thought that counts though, so thank you!
@_date: 2014-04-29 11:49:25
Thanks! =)
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:55:14
Wow! Thank you!!
@_date: 2014-05-24 10:22:22
Damn, you Americans have it so good with Coinbase. I'm jealous. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 21:39:26
Are these meant to be instantaneous? Haven't got any messages yet, and dogetipbot says my balance is zero!
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:56:43
Thanks a lot!!!! That's awesome!

Just sent my Bitcoin to a cold storage paper wallet. Will not be using Block chain again.  I'm glad this didn't affect you too badly,  loosing 15 Bitcoin would've devastated me. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 09:08:33
I realise now it wasn't very tasteful to put my Bitcoin address in the post, but honestly I wasn't exactly sure what it was for!
I have removed my address from the post now.

Hey, thanks for answering! I just subscribed to [r/BitcoinBeginners.]( Excited to learn more!
@_date: 2014-04-24 17:52:10
That's pretty cool! Yes I'm using that app. (Thanks to the people that are sending me coins btw, that's super cool! )
By the way, if I download a desktop app to do Bitcoining with(it feels safer), can I transfer the wallet? Or do I just make a new wallet and transfer the coins?
Also if anyone's reading this, what are the purposes of Bitcoin ATM's? If you can simply scan QR codes to send/receive money why are ATMs needed at bars etc?
Thanks for your help guys!

Where has Andreas addressed his opinions on GHash? I can't find anything.

The market is ready for an entrepreneur to provide us Brits with a reliable easy exchange like Coinbase.
 
I currently use [Bittylicious]( I got the coins in my wallet very quickly and was quite impressed.
However the current price of Bitcoin is £266.73, and they're selling for £279.66 which is a £12.93 profit or almost 5%. Seems a bit steep, and I doubt US users pay as much. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 17:37:02
Hahaha, thanks I guess!
@_date: 2014-04-24 16:46:16
The app's name is just Bitcoin, it has a peach coloured background with a white 'B'. 
I think it's legitimate because your Bitcoins came through, thank you so much! Also thanks for answering my questions =)

What does NYA stand for?
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:20:35
Perfect, thanks.
Another question, wondering if you'd be able to point me in the right direction.
Do you know of any guide/video/forum to join for beginner bitcoin users? I was into it before but lost a lot of knowledge. Recently stumbled into a podcast that reignited my interest.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:48:24
It's a little bit too technical for me, I got to the transactions bit where he explains the input and output system and I am just lost.
Is there anything you would suggest that's a bit more dumbed down?
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:08:08
More for me
