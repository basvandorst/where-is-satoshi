Sure he's not right about government's not being able to collect income taxes.
The ledger is open and every Satoshi can be traced. It seems to me that this makes tax collection a lot more accurate than it is today. I'm not saying that that is better, worse or more fair than it is now, just that this could be a more transparent system. Which probably does mean that it's better.

I currently use bitcoin to buy cards from Gyft and Egifter. So if those guys have a gift card for a store, I'll buy it. For all restaurant/pizza places, I buy them in $100 denominations. For Home Depot, Lowes, etc, I typically buy $400 cards. At one time they had cards for Wal-Mart, when they did, I bought those. 
When looking for any online service (Usenet, VPN, Web hosting, etc) I will only use someone who accepts bitcoin. It is only in the last resort that I will use Paypal or a credit card.
So in answer to your question: everything.

Yes, Armory is complicated.
I think you can do all that you are asking with any of a number of programs. For the "always offline" part, you might want to have a dual-boot box. Or, perhaps better yet: Put Knoppix on a USB and boot from that.
Generate key pairs with [VanityGen]( It works offline, plus you can generate - well, vanity addresses like "1bernardch1234567.blah.blah." (Might take a while). Print it to a paper wallet and you are pretty much bullet-proof secure. Transfer no more than say 1 BTC to a phone app at a time.
For phone apps, there are several for Android but none that will send for Apple (And I'd HIGHLY recommend that you do not jailbreak your iPhone for this purpose). I don' know what's available for Blackberry, I don't think there's anything.
I use "Bitcoin" and Mycelium on my phone. Both work just great. And both will scan/send/receive and track transactions on the blockchain.

I would have no difficulty spending that amount of btc for a product that I wanted. Demographically I don't fit because I don't have a dog and I'm way over your average age.
One thing that you might consider is using or offering some escrow agent since there is no way for me to get my money back if the product is not delivered. I'd most likely take the risk if it was a $100 expenditure, but $1,700 is getting into the range where non-performance by the vendor hurts.

In the announcement, they were saying that the rate would be 3 cents for 24 hours and 1 cent for a single article.
It doesn't seem that the actual implementation has been anything like that, but lets assume that they had done what was announced.
I would definitely be willing to pay a few cents to read an article in a national newspaper - in fact, I'd be willing to pay more than the amount that was announced. Consider though that the fiat paywalls generally require a somewhat elaborate sign up process and the payment of several dollars. I've never signed up for one and I doubt that I ever would unless the article had something that was of very specific interest to me.
It seems to me that the BTC paywall has several advantages over the fiat paywalls:
* The cost is more reasonable and can be "scaled" to the amount that I use.
* There in no sign-up required. I don't have to enter any personal information or any email addresses.
* It's really easy to hold my phone up to the screen, click the "pay" button and get what I came for - nothing like that exists with any fiat paywall that I am aware of.
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:43:34
There are two "restrictions" on the borrower's actions:
First, he can only borrow up to 2.5 times the amount that he has in his account. So if the market goes down (up in the case of a short sale), you as a lender are not "out of the money" until the market is below 60% of his purchase price (above 140% in a short sale).
Second, there is a requirement that the borrower always be 13% above those levels. So you are always dealing with a borrower who has enough funds on deposit to cover his position.
If the market goes further and he is below the 13% requirement then he will get a margin call and have to put more money/BTC into his account, or he will be forced out of his position with a market order.
BTW, you do not deal with a specific individual. You don't know who the borrower is. What's more, it may well be more than one individual and each of those individuals is likely to be borrowing from multiple lenders.
Edit: The borrower can have either BTC or $'s in his account to cover his position. Since the asset that he's using to cover his position may also be changing value, the %ages above are not hard and fast but must be constantly re-calculated.
@_date: 2014-02-05 11:27:24
Yes, they do.
I've used them - and paid with BTC. You have to put money into your account, then you can use it to pay for your domains. I don't really like that system.
Also, they have not been very responsive to support questions. It takes about 2 days for them to answer. So this is not a strong recommendation to use them.

Businesses that take BTC usually use BitPay or Coinbase to convert the BTC to fiat immediately. They in turn dump most of those BTC on the exchanges. The increase in the number of businesses that take BTC has increased the number of BTC being dumped on the exchanges, which tends to drive prices down.
At the same time, there is still some difficulty for new buyers to get into this market, so the buyers are being outspent by the sellers.
Eventually it will reach an equilibrium.

Do they warn of the very real dangers of holding other assets and especially fiat? Or is BTC singled out for criticism?

I don't think that a hacker needed to compromise two accounts.
Actually, In order to steal the BTC, the hacker doesn't even need a keylogger. All that the hacker needs is the ability to copy the browser cookies and history. With those files, he can log into the account without a password and transfer the BTC anywhere he likes. Of course this does assume that the user has cached the password.
Without a cached password, this won't work.
BUT. Your point about an email would be a valid safety net even if the password was cached. If Coinbase sent an email to the user alerting him that a transfer had been requested, then the user may/should have time to react and tell them not to make the transfer. So yes, an email would be helpful.
If the hacker also has a keylogger installed on the target machine, then even an email will not prevent the theft because the hacker will change the email password in order to lock the user out, intercept the email, and give permission for the transfer. I'm assuming that permission could be granted by simply replying to the email. I guess you should have 2FA on the email reply, but since none of this system exists, it's all speculation anyhow.
Moral of this story: Don't cache your password.
Even thought it's a PITA to go in the other room to get your cell phone, it's still less disquietude than losing a couple of thousand dollars worth of BTC.

I'd submit that a trading bot is different and not as sinister as what was happening here. A trading bot is making a preprogrammed decision to buy or sell. Presumably it has no systemic advantage over a human investor.

You're right but...
Consider the other end of the spectrum that you address. Any one of those entities could be gone overnight. Bitcoin cannot go away. The math has been let out of the bottle and it can't be put back.
Bitcoin is a fundamentally different thing than everything else on that chart. It can do pretty much what all of those companies do plus a lot more. But unlike everything else, it doesn't deal in dollars. Something that everyone knows and everyone feels comfy with. The dollars and the mode of transaction are all simple and known.

Apparently the market generally feels that BTC will increase by 10% in that time frame.
BTW, when prices were collapsing following the news that China was going to withdraw from the BTC market, MtGox's price was lower than Bitstamp's price for a short time. Again, reflecting the market perception that the future value of BTC was lower than the current more liquid price on Bitstamp.

The first and largest BTC exchange has been steadily declining in useability for some time. It seems that they are now in a state of virtual paralysis. That is unsettling for the market in total and is probably the reason for the latest drop.
So far, other exchanges - especially Bitstamp - are working OK, so this will most probably be a temporary drop and prices will recover.

I believe you must use a FIFO system. That is how I filed my taxes. You need to align all buys with sells in chronological order and with equal quantity.
5/1/2013 Buy 1 @ $200 - 7/1/2013 Sell 1 @ $300 (Profit = $100)
6/1/2013 Buy .5 @ $250 - 7/1/2013 Sell .5 @ $300 (Profit = $25)
You still hold .5 bought on 7/1/2013. That will be used in 2014 if you sell more.

They are selling through BitPay and Coinbase. Which means that the BTC are immediately being dumped back on the exchanges. This has a downward effect on the current price of BTC.

It makes perfect sense that there is such a large gap. The price on Gox is just right.
Gox is a futures exchange. You sell your BTC for what they will be worth 6 months into the future - which is when you get your $'s.
During the Great China Crash their USD price was actually below other exchanges like Bitstamp. Because the future price was expected to be below the current price.

I've got BTC loaned out there. I did notice that the rate has been climbing lately. And is now up to about .12%/day. Which is very high for BTC; it's usually an order of magnitude lower than that.
The dollar rate is actually lower than the BTC rate. I can't recall ever seeing that happen before.
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:17:03
That's not exactly true.
The remaining 49% would be invalidating blocks. You're thinking there would be some tug-of-war and the winner would win. But basically it would disrupt the whole system and cause a crash on the exchanges.
So then the miners would have more coins that were worth less - or rather - worthless.

They might open their doors to BTC again. But only if/when they see that they are losing the war with BTC. If sales of phones drops because people want a BTC app, they will sheepishly allow it back in.

I've been struggling with spreadsheets and macros to try to do what you have done here. I'm going to give ledger a try.
Unfortunately, I've got over 10,000 transactions and this is a very daunting task. I would have had my taxes filed a month ago if I'd been able to figure this out.
The reason I've been determined to "do the right thing" is exactly your point: What if bitcoin gains significant value, say it goes to $10,000. If you start to spend those BTC for significant purchases, the IRS is likely to look at your previous transactions. If you do not have records of capital gains in prior years, you are going to be liable for some significant penalties and interest.

I've been trading and lending on Bitfinex since March 2013. I've been quite pleased with the experience.
1) There is no minimum.
2) There's never going to be a 100% guarantee. But I think your question is about the mechanism of lending, not the chance for a catastrophic event or fraud. In that sense, there is still not a 100% guarantee and we saw the risk turn to reality in early 2013 when the market had a sharp correction and there were insufficient orders on the books to cover some of the margin calls. Raphael covered everyone's position so no lender lost any money. He then introduced the insurance feature on lent funds. To the best of my knowledge, nobody has ever needed it. I personally never bother to buy it. But that scenario could play out again.
It's important to note that the Bitfinex's market was a lot thinner then than it is now.
3) I usually lend at the current flash rate. In fact, that's all I've used for the last year. Dollars are nearly always taken at that rate - meaning that my dollar swaps are virtually 100% taken. Bitcoin has been less in demand, usually about 25% is out at any given time.

What you says is basically true. And easily proven.
If you save your username/PW, using 2FA, then shutdown, power-off, unplug, remove hard drive, move to a different country and sign up with a different service provider, then put it back together and restart it. You can log back into Coinbase without entering any information.

I haven't sold on eBay in 2 years. But back then, I sold quite a lot and they definitely did allow html in listings. I would create the page in an html client and simply c&amp;p it into the listing.
I think eBay will quickly kill your listings and warn/ban you if you offer BTC as a payment option. At least that's what I've heard. And it sort of makes sense from their control freakish standpoint: they can't do a chargeback for a disgruntled buyer if he paid in BTC.
You could try cryptothrift.com. I have bought items there and, as a buyer, found them to be very good.

First, it appears that only one man knew where everything was - or where it was supposed to be. There doesn't appear to have been any auditing or quality control used in the organization. If that's all true, then most likely that one man became overwhelmed with the number of transactions and the complexity of running the organization and he has lost them or inadvertently disposed of them or had them stolen and does not know how or where. IOW: comical mismanagement.
Alternatively he stole them. Perhaps by using customer reserves to gamble on the price.

@_date: 2014-01-22 03:48:12
Much as I think that's a good thing. I don't think it will last.
I think what's currently happening is this: A lot of businesses are beginning to accept BTC: Casinos, Overstock, the Sacramento Kings, etc. But none of them are really taking BTC. What's happening is BitPay is swapping the BTC for dollars on one of the exchanges. People who have seen their BTC wallet appreciate in value are using those appreciated BTC to buy stuff and the BTC themselves are immediately being sold on the exchange. So right now you have new entrants into the BTC market buying BTC that older entrants have just spent. It hasn't yet reached an equilibrium - in fact, I'd guess that it's a long way from equilibrium. My guess is that it will have a depressing effect on the markets in the short term.
But once the channels to purchase get sorted out, there will be a lot of new money coming in.
This is just the calm before the storm.

First, there wasn't an internet on which the common man could express his ignorant opinion and have it read by hundreds of other ignorant men. So the medium for spreading FUD didn't exist in the way that it does today.
The best medium of social communication: the news media did a weak, but generally accurate depiction of email and of the internet in the early days. News media were not fighting for their lives the way they are now. In fact, they were very much at the top, having enormous influence over national opinion and also making money. These things (email, Internet) were not viewed as competitors. That doesn't mean that there were not some scathing articles/broadcasts about "the dark side of the Internet."
Bitcoin raises something emotional in the human psyche that the Internet and email never did. The Internet and email are "passive" by comparison to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has created wealth for many people and that is emotionally charging. Yes, the Internet did too. But not in the same way. The Internet created wealth by the old fashioned route of starting a business, advertising and selling wares. Bitcoin is available to everyone, everywhere, right now. Who among us does not wish that he could turn the clock back 5 years and start mining like crazy? If you've missed that boat, then - for many people - that's cause for anger and envy because you could have done it so easily.

OK, it's still unclear how this attack was accomplished. One possibility is that the attacker installed a keylogger and copied the browser cookies and history. If that happened, then an email to the user would be ineffective because the hacker would have intercepted that email. In that scenario 2FA would not save the day.
The other scenario, which I now think is more likely is that the user logged into a phishing site. 2FA still doesn't help but your original point is largely valid: An email may have saved him.
BTW, in neither case do two different servers need to be breached. Both cases rely upon poor security awareness by the user.

It's called [selling short against the box]( It's done to hedge a position. 500 long 250 short gives you .50 profit for every 1 that the asset gains in price.
If you are bearish on bitcoin (which your initial question suggests), then you'd want to go short more than long (e.g. 500 short and 250 long). If you are really bearish, then go all short.

The encryption of QT, and your (pretty good) passphrase mean that someone either had the passphrase or they obtained the private key in some other way.
So either you have a keylogger on the machine or the private key was exposed elsewhere.
Googling "[how to find a keylogger]( might be a good idea. Even though that particular horse has gone, you may still be at risk.
I agree with whoever said that anti-virus software is not helpful. It slows your machine, gives you a false sense of security, misses real viruses, [falsely accuses valid programs of containing viruses that aren't there]( And is designed to detect a virus - which a keylogger is not.

I think so too. I'm sure that the IRS will be delighted to take a share of your BTC gains, I'm just wondering if they will be so accommodating if BTC is costing them revenue. Or if that is the point when they say that it was a hobby, not engaged in for profit, and the losses are just your cost of entertainment.
Next question: Let's say I bought 100 BTC in January for $10 each and 100 more in February for $20 each. I then sell 150 BTC  in March for $30 each. What's my cost on that sale? Is it $2,000 (FIFO), $2,250 (Average) or $2,500 (LIFO). Keeping track of the value of bitcoin is a real challenge no matter which method is used. I've made literally thousands of trades during 2013.

This question is asked repeatedly.
The lack of liquidity on MtGox is the reason that the strategy is not profitable and why it's not being done.
Perhaps it's counter-intuitive that the exchange that has the liquidity problem is the one with the higher dollar value. I guess you could think of it as dollars are getting backed up there since the only reasonable way to get dollars out is to trade them into BTC and move them to a more liquid exchange.

MtGox was doing about 30,000 BTC trade per day. That's over 40,000 BTC in revenue per year. Dunno what their costs are but I have to think that it's pretty low - couple of million dollars a year maybe?
At a sale price of 750KBTC that still leaves you with a P/E ratio under 20. That's pretty low for a super high tech company with an earning potential that (if you listen to the hype) is way, way higher than it is today.

When this question has come up before, the general consensus is that for "small" transactions, there is no practical reason to wait for confirmations. The likelihood of fraud is too small and the skill needed to perpetrate it is too great to make it worthwhile for either the buyer or the seller.
Of course, at some level it would be wise for the seller to hold the sale. The level is a matter of judgement by the seller.

eBay was once a small company that was struggling to survive. True, there was not much competition but I do remember compgeeks.com who was an online auction seller of computer hardware and was definitely larger than eBay Back in the 1996-97 time-frame. I'm sure that, if bitcoin existed back then, eBay would have been overjoyed to provide that new method of payment. That would have helped to differentiated themselves from their competition. You only need to think of Silk Road to see the benefit that bitcoin payments would have had for an online auction forum.
Today eBay is huge and places many restrictions on their customers in order to game the system and maximize their profit at the expense of customer convenience. One obvious restriction being the deliberate funneling of buyer revenue through an eBay owned financial entity: Paypal.
The self-dealing of eBay is highlighted by the fact that there are a number of companies out there that make bitcoin payments work; companies like Overstock.com. Yet eBay prohibits the use of bitcoin.
Some day, bitcoin may become a viable competitor to Paypal for online purchases. When that day comes, eBay will welcome bitcoin with wide open arms, claiming that eBay has always been an innovative company on the leading edge of creativity and as such wholeheartedly supports this novel technology.
And people will start using bitcoin to buy things on eBay. And eBay will continue to grow.
@_date: 2015-07-15 23:52:39
Yes, it's a taxable event. Your basis in bitcoin is the value at which you acquired them plus any transaction fees. Buying with them results in a capital gain/loss; again, less any transaction fees. As I recall, you can only use FIFO for your holding period.
If you have numerous transactions, then it can become complex.

Microsoft has 8.2B shares outstanding. The current market price for their stock is about $41 per share for a market cap of about $336B. The Owners Equity on their balance sheet is about $90B. So the market is paying a premium of about $246B for that stock.
Presumably the $246B represents the future potential of MSFT. If you buy MSFT stock, less than 30% of your purchase price goes to buy tangible assets. The remaining 70% buys ephemeral possibilities that may never become reality.
So if you buy bitcoin, 100% goes to buy ephemeral possibilities. All that you've done is shift the zero point.
Meanwhile, you own a commodity that has some real capabilities not shared with anything else that man has ever found: the ability to transfer value anywhere on the planet with ease. I'd say that that capability has a lot of value in its own right.
And yea, you're right in your first sentence: it's not like traditional asset. It's absolutely not like a traditional asset. And that's what makes it so damned valuable.

Of course this happens with many products today. The traditional way to hedge against price inflation/deflation is to buy futures in that product or in the currency of the contract. Yes, there is a premium that has to be paid, but that premium is the cost of making your contract predictable.

I don't think they will sell them with no regard for the market. I would expect them to try to maximize their take. That probably means selling them in bulk to the highest bidder in an asset auction.

The majority of people I know need to spend the majority of what they earn immediately. Unfortunately, that's the way most of us live. So it doesn't matter if the currency is inflationary or deflationary. The time from earning it until it's spent is too short for in/de-flation to have any impact on its value.
Now, the majority of people I know also have some savings in the form of 401K's etc. All of which is a constant worry because what we carefully saved a decade ago is now worth little more or even less than it was we put it aside.
I'm close to retirement age and I have savings and retirement plans. But I have to keep working because I am not at all confident that those investments will last, I might be unlucky enough to live a long life and outlive the assets in a 401K.  If I only knew the date of my death I could plan this stuff so much better.

You make it sound as though this is a deliberate, concerted and agreed strategy by a group of like minded investors.
It's just the price point that a bunch of traders have chosen to alter their position. As I type this, Bitstamp is at 1141 and there is a small wall at 1200. For those traders who bought BTC on Friday, 1200 is a nice round number to sell and take a profit. So, that wall probably represents the independent choice that a dozen traders have chosen to take some profit.
There is no manipulation.

This question gets asked every hour, on the hour.
If you think you can profit by buying Bitcoin on Bitstamp and selling them on MtGox, then you should do that.
However, you will most likely discover that all those extra dollars that you now have on MtGox are trapped in a penalty box and the only way to get them out is to buy Bitcoin and move the Bitcoin to a functional exchange. Thereby defeating the whole purpose of buying Bitcoin there in the first place.

I called him and he confirmed that he was at home in Chicago, that he was getting calls from everyone in address book but couldn't email anyone because his password no longer worked - not surprisingly since the scammer had changed it.

* Margin Balance is the actual value that you have in your trading wallet.
* Tradable balance is the amount that you can put toward trades. It starts at twice the margin balance (Since you have elected a 2:1 margin)
* Net value is what your position is currently worth
* Required margin is the amount that you must have before you start getting margin calls.
* Leverage is self explanatory. You can make that ratio larger on the account settings page.
Make sure that you have some funds in your trading wallet. The best way to learn is to try. So just put in a buy order for 0.01 BTC (I think that's the lowest amount you can trade). What's the worst that can happen? You lose $0.02 in fees and if the market crashes like an atomic bomb hit it, you could lose $8.00. Big deal.
And go at it slowly, you can make some good money trading on margin and you can also lose money fast. But you already knew that.

Actually. Portable phones were commercially available in the mid 60's. They weren't "cellular." The only phone company back then was Ma Bell. But she'd sell you one. I contacted Bell and asked about getting one.
The phone company would install it in your car. (Failing memory but) I think the cost of installation was a couple of hundred bucks plus $60 per month plus metered service on the line (that's 1967 dollars). So this was out of the reach of the average consumer.
I don't think you would have got much criticism from the average guy about the "idea" of having one in your car. Pretty much everyone would have like to have it. But cost just made it absurd.
I'd suggest that this is a bit different from BTC though. Phones were well understood long before they became portable and the idea of walking around with one could be easily comprehended. Bitcoin is a technological difference from $'s. People can't grasp it as readily.

Bitcoin is a misnomer, It's really Value Transmission Protocol. It's similar to SMTP, which was invented in 1982.

It was criticized as being useless and people said that the government would shut it down because it competed with the USPO.
Today, we're in the same position.
And 5 years from now, when it becomes more widely accepted, you'll buy your coffee from Dunkin Donuts in the morning and swipe you phone in the general direction of their BTC receiving station and think nothing of it.

I don't think that the ASIC's will have any meaningful effect on the price. Most of us "little guys" who have been pushing this market up so far do not mine; we just invest.
The miners had an impact in the early days - heck, they were the market in the early days.
Of course, having a lot of investors is not a good thing either. What we really need to sustain the growth of bitcoin are a lot more users.

I think this is great.
If I was a seller and had a buyer in Nigeria, I'd ship without hesitation if he paid with BTC. And no other method of payment.
I'm pretty sure that Visa, MC, etc refuse to do business there. So it gives the Nigerians the ability to enter the world market for which it has previously been very difficult for them to participate.

Since BTC is a network protocol, that would mean that everyone in the country would (or at least should) be on the network. I mean, would you trust a paper wallet that said "1 BTC" on the outside without checking for yourself?
Ecuador and Zimbabwe (and others that I can't recall at the moment) use the US$ as their official currency without having the benefit of running the presses. IOW: they don't have the benefit of inflating their worries away like the US. So why not switch to BTC, they'd lose nothing and, have a globally spendable currency.

This is a recent thread that describes the issue:
In your MyGox account, go to "security center." At the bottom of the page is "Current API Keys." Unless you set that up, it should read "You have no API keys configured at this time."
I did read that one enterprising crook named his fraudulent API key: "You have no API keys configured at this time." Clever. Wonder if MtGox prohibited that name yet.

During a 10 minute period, a number of transactions are initiated. Each transaction has an identifying number. The last "valid" block also has an identifying number. Combine all those numbers and also a random number that you can create and hash the whole thing. If the hash is less than a very very small number then you are a winner and you get the block reward (25 BTC) plus all the transaction fees from all those transactions.
It is assumed that SHA-256 (the hashing algorithm) cannot be reversed. So far that's proven to be a valid assumption. Then the only way you can get the very, very small number is by trial and error.
The very, very small number can get bigger or smaller to decrease or increase the difficulty and maintain a relatively constant block generation rate. Basically, that number just keeps getting smaller as miners become ever more powerful.

Not sure that I understand your question. You are required to have 13% margin in the account. If your balance drops to that level you will be forced out.
Examle: I started with $1000 in the account (Margin Balance and Net Value are both $1000). That gave me a $2,000 tradable balance. I bought $2000 worth of BTC at $1000 each (so I bought 2 BTC). Now assume that the market goes against me and the value of BTC drops to $600. I've lost $800 in value so my Net value is now $200 or 20% and I'm very nervous. The "Unrealized P/L" will be a red $800.
That ignores trading fees and interest on my loan.
As for the loan. You can go to the lending tab and select loans (Dollars or BTC depending on your mood) before you start any trading. The money will then be ready as soon as you are ready to buy or sell. Alternatively, as long as you have funds in your trading wallet, you can just hit the buy or sell button and a loan will be created automatically based on the best available rate.
What's more, if you have BTC in your trading wallet and you want to go long (you need to borrow $'s). The system will do the calculation for you and borrow dollars. One wrinkle with that: if your position goes south, you will not only be losing on the position itself but also on the value of your "capital" since it's in BTC and you will hit a margin call much sooner.
Like I said, try a small position and watch what happens.

Take the ID of transactions made during the last 10 minutes, the transaction ID of the last "legitimate" block, add a random number and hash the whole thing. If the hash is less than a very, very small number, then you are a winner and get a block reward and get to keep all the transaction fees in that block.
The very, very small number can get larger or smaller to control the rate of block creation. Generally, it just keeps getting smaller.

I don't think that they hate sellers. Though if you are a seller it certainly does seem that way.
I think what they do is err heavily on the side of the buyer, because any bad press about bad sellers would cause buyers to stop coming to the site, whereas bad press about bad or scamming buyers might actually bring more. eBay would rather lose a bunch of good sellers than allow one bad seller to harm their reputation.
And unfortunately, they don't care. I guess they feel that there are always more sellers in the wings ready to fill in for the poor schmuck who they threw under the bus.

4. Bitcoin will not go away now. Even if prices tumble there will still be bitcoins in circulation 10 years from now - and prices won't tumble very far.
5. Something needs to happen to put bitcoins in the hands of the hoi polloi. Right now, negotiating through wallets and exchanges is far too complicated for the average citizen.
Let me pose one possible scenario that could shift BTC from the realm of an experimental curiosity into the realm of a financial essential: Incremental billing. BTC's have a unique ability to fill that role.
You need Internet connectivity while you are in a foreign place? How about WiFi-by-the-minute billed against the BTC wallet on your laptop. The point is that this is seamless, runs in the background and anybody can do it.
PGP was once viewed as being a terrorists tool. The inventor was investigated for arms trafficking. Now PGP is built into a miriad of communication devices and is universally viewed as a "good thing." And importantly: most of the people who use it on a daily basis are clueless that it even exists, let alone how to generate a public key.
If bitcoin is at that level of transparency, then it will fulfill it's prophecy.

Sounds like WebLoyalty.com aka WLI*Reservation Rewards. I think they may finally have been shut down but they ran that scam for a decade. Usually, their modus operandi was to refrain from billing you for two or three months from the time that you "signed up." Making it very difficult for you to figure out how/when you had signed up.
Of course you had no clue that you had ever "signed up." It usually happened when you bought something online and during the payment sequence a web page appeared with a checkbox (selected by default) saying something innocuous like "For a $10 coupon good for your next purchase check this box." You left it checked and bingo! they got your CC data.
I have to assume that the Connecticut Attorney General was on their payroll. The number of complaints that the BBB received was staggering yet they were permitted to continue right on stealing OPM. See [this]( and especially the [linked complaint]( for an entertaining read.

 disclaimers
During the last ~6 months, Bitcoin has weathered some significant storms (MtGox fiasco, Bitfloor, Liberty Gold, Thailand, etc) yet Bitcoin has come out pretty much as viable as it was before any of this happened.
About the only thing that could completely sink Bitcoin now is the US government coming out and claiming that Bitcoin inherently violates AML laws(1). But so far, the US government's public stance and public statements have been mildly positive toward Bitcoin.
More people are becoming aware of Bitcoin every day. If this increasing awareness keeps going in the same direction, then we should hit the critical point where normal people view this as a viable and desirable way to pay for things - we seem to be a long way from that right now, but these things can move quickly and can be dramatic when they happen. If that happens, then your bitcoins will be worth a whole lot more than they are right now. And that's just math.
(1) Yea, it's the US government that counts. Sorry. But if the US decides to outlaw BTC, all the other 1st world countries will follow suit - Think of the countries that refused to allow the Bolivian President to overfly their airspace on rumors that Snowden was on board. Think of the countries that have ganged up on Assange because the US wants him. No other country has the muscle to force that kind of compliance. That's just the way the world rolls.

The banks were giving them away. You'd get an unsolicited credit card in the mail every week. I remember throwing them in the trash - never thought about or even knew about identity theft back then.
People had cards with large department stores like Sears, CP&amp;S, Marshall Fields, etc. And those stores hung on to their captive audience for a long time - refusing to take any credit card other than their own.

Believe it or not. I'm old enough to remember when it was noteworthy that the train on which I rode from Ipswich to London was diesel and not steam.
Jet engines have replaced propellers; Automatic transmission has replaced stick shift; Air conditioning has come into existence (I guess its predecessor was a wet sheet and a fan). The first TV that I saw was in 1959, first color TV was probably ~1961.
I don't think any of these things met with the same level of disdain as BTC. I can't recall anyone saying that credit cards (1970 ish) were a Ponzi scheme or that The Government will shut down this newfangled Internet thingy. The only things I recall garnering this much vitriol would be boom boxes (perhaps rightly so) or smoking bans (for you youngens, imagine a world where there were no such things as "no smoking" signs - that was the 1960's). Both of these things impinged on the comfort of the complainer. So you can kinda understand why they were met with resistance.
Pure speculation follows: Bitcoin is different from these other technological innovations in one important respect: Bitcoin is money. If you missed the boat with Bitcoin, you missed out on an opportunity to have more money in your pocket. That's not true with the other things on the list. For instance, if you were a late adopter of the cell phone you didn't bemoan all those phone calls that you could have made. Heck, you might even feel smug that by waiting you were able to purchase the phone a whole lot cheaper than those fools who paid so much in the early days.
I think that a lot of the "nonsensical arguments" stem from anger born of the fact that the writer has missed the chance to be a wealthy early adopter.

I doubt it very much. You would indeed have proof of delivery - which is missing with the normal BTC transaction. However, the buyer would claim that the item was not as described. Paypal/eBay requires that the buyer send the item back. So they would send the paper wallet back to you (obviously empty of BTC). They would technically have fulfilled PayPal's requirement and the chargeback would go through.
You'd be out all your BTC.

The reason MtGox's price is high right now is because people can't get their $'s out. The reason why btc-e is low is because people can't get their $'s in.

And BTW, you are probably not the first person who has thought about arbitrage between Gox and BTC-e.

Nobody without a functional crystal ball knows the answer to that. But if you could do it, then the measly Billion dollars tied up in BTC wouldn't be your most lucrative target.

This is correct. I trade on Bitfinex quite a lot. I've had many sell-limit orders execute above my asking sell price.
In your example, where there were bids at 730. If you place a sell-limit order at 710, a window will pop up asking if you really want to place an order below market value - since the system recognizes that there are bids above your value. You answer "yes" and the system will immediately sell all those orders down to and including the one at 710. You get $7185.
Just as a side note: there are reasons why you might deliberately sell below market. I do it in order to close out of a position quickly, yet give myself a safety net that a market order doesn't have.

Places like Bitfinex and icbit.se allow you to do that on margin. So you can profit from a decline in BTC prices. Merely exchanging to another currency doesn't give you any leverage.
Consider: Assume 1BTC = $100. Deposit $100 in Bitfinex. Short 2.5 BTC. If the price drops to $90 say, Close position and withdraw $125.
Of course if the price goes the other way then: Lose sleep and curse.

I assume that you have an online store or sell on eBay. I'd suggest that the number of people who know about BTC is still very small. Unless you are selling on BitMit The large majority of your customers will prefer PayPal.

I think you answered a slightly different question:
If I have a private key, what is the chance that someone else has the same key?
10 billion = 10^10

Agreed sale price = 100 BTC.
* Seller creates wallet and deposits 10 BTC with a multi-signature transaction.
* Buyer deposits 110 BTC.
* Seller sends the goods to buyer.
If Buyer is satisfied, he signs the wallet which sends 110 BTC to seller and returns 10 BTC to buyer.
If Buyer is dissatisfied he returns goods to seller. Buyer is still out 110 BTC at this point but seller cannot regain his 10 BTC "escrow" until he signs, which simultaneously returns buyer's 110 BTC.
Obviously 10% is an arbitrary number and need not be equal for buyer and seller. Buyer's 10% overpayment is the incentive for buyer to release the funds to seller if buyer is happy with the goods.
Seller's 10% is assumed to be enough of an incentive for seller to return funds to buyer.

Though the sarcastic reply below is perhaps unnecessarily sarcastic. He is right. This topic has been covered repeatedly.
As for PayPal's need to have proof of delivery. You'd think that the blockchain would be an excellent way to prove delivery. But, of course, it is in PayPal's interest to pretend that Bitcoin has no value and the blockchain is meaningless, inaccessible, inaccurate, incomprehensible or whatever other fib suits their purpose.
I don't know whether [this]( works but I've seen a few listings like it from BTC sellers. If the envelope is received, then the seller has proof that meets PayPal/eBay's requirement. However, I wouldn't be at all surprised if PayPal suddenly became very aware of the technical details and value of Bitcoin and refused to cover the envelope because it contained an item of great value.

What he said^
One of the advantages of BTC: once the buyer transfers the money, you have it. It's not like a check that can bounce.
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:42:18
Oh. And I have a Bitcoin addendum to the MIL story:
When this was happening last year, wife asked me if we could put the money into BTC in Germany and transfer it over here that way.
I said, "Honey, I don't think you want to confuse your mom with Bitcoins. Shit, she's older than me and that's really fucking old."
So wife dealt with the banks and the wire transfer. Which took at least a month and countless hours of wife's time getting the right routing number and the right forms faxed to Germany and the right Shlosselstoffer (or whatever the hell he was) to pay the right tax. (Then when all this crap was done, to have the bank here send the money back to MIL just adds to the total insanity to the whole affair).
OK, but here's the punch line.
Last week MIL asks me, "Hey, Gargoyle, can you put this money into Bitcoins for me?"
I was totally speechless.

OK, I'm definitely not selling diamonds. I'm willing to take the risk that a ~$5.00 purchase is not guaranteed. BUT. The length of time from when a transaction is actually made and the enter key pressed until it shows up on blockchain.info as "unconfirmed" can easily be 1/2 hour. I've seen that a number of times. I can't ask the buyer to stand around that long - I could if I were selling diamonds.
Is there a faster way to get to and "unconfirmed" confirmation? KWIM?

a) This happened several weeks ago. Maybe longer.
b) There are a bunch of copycats and, unlike the original hostage takers who were "honest" crooks and sent you the private key after you paid, the copycats don't provide the private key but just reply with a childish "FU sucker" after you pay the ransom.
1) BACK UP.
2) Think carefully about paying any ransom, because it is very likely that you are just throwing money away. 
3) Most importantly: Back up.

One other thing may be occurring: The SR thing hit the Main Stream Media just about two weeks ago. A lot of people heard about BTC for the first time when that happened.

The likelihood of generating a low number is only a function of chance. We must assume that nobody has figured out a way to reverse SHA-256. And so far, that seems like a safe assumption.

I guess I would first take issue with his choice of the word "easy." I read recently that it is easier to forge Gold than it is to forge BTC. All that you need to forge gold (Atomic number 79) is some Platinum (Atomic number 78) and a nuclear reactor. BTC requires something more technically challenging than that.
I tend to think that's an accurate assessment; though I am not a mathematician, so I take the word of those who understand cryptography.
"Hijacking signatures" seems to be saying the same thing. If I can generate a private key for your public key (and sign your BTC over to my wallet) then the whole cryptographic security fails and I can steal your BTC at will. However, I would like to point out in passing that if that becomes possible - say through the discovery of a new branch of mathematics - then it isn't just BTC that is vulnerable. All VPN, Phone and data traffic probably becomes compromised too. Why steal a measly billion dollars worth of BTC when I could use that ability to steal all bank wire transfers?
If by hijacking, he means sniffing your network and redirecting/stealing your BTC. Then he has a point. But then, I'm going to say that we all know that. We *should* all be taking precautions to prevent that from happening. That is a failure of security, not a failure of BTC.

Pretty sure that the bank didn't just decide to report him. Pretty sure that they were following mandated procedures and had no real option.

A court has equity power to hold you in contempt if you don't reveal some piece of information. This has happened when, for instance, an attorney refuses to reveal the identity of his client (who is known by the police to have committed a crime).
If the attorney reveals the client's name he risks malpractice. If he doesn't he can be ordered to sit in jail until he does. And since the court is using it's [equity power]( the attorney can sit there until the judge retires from the bench.

I think your observation is accurate. I'd like to order a pizza using BC, just because it would be fun and cool. But the hassle of converting from $ to BC is not really practical.
My Mother-in-law recently inherited a house in Germany - which she promptly sold. I suggested that she exchange the Euros from the sale into BC and then pull them out as $'s when and where needed. She would have saved a lot in exchange rate and bank charges. Though she didn't do it (She doesn't own a computer at all, so she really couldn't comprehend the whole digital currency concept) I think it would have been a practical use of BC's. But then again, how often do you really need to do something like that?

No counting change, no short change, no credit cards being rejected even though you know that there are ample funds in the account, no opportunity for someone to get your credit card number from a discarded receipt, no entering PIN numbers at check-out.

Sorry. I was being snide.
My point though is that arbitrage _is_ occurring between those exchanges. It's just that the "cost" of doing it is reflected in the difference in their respective bid/ask prices.
You can wire dollars to or from both exchanges. You will pay a fee to do that and you must wait some time for banks to move the dollars. Those are the costs.
In spite of that, you can still make money doing it.
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:18:22
This has been discussed before. For someone to set up a double spend on a $10 transaction, they'd have to be desperate. The shop owner takes no real risk.
Now, if it was a $40K car, that might be a different story. You might want the customer to hang around for a little while.
@_date: 2013-09-20 13:09:51
OK, true. But you must concede that the opportunity loss of tying up 20 BTC for the duration of the transaction is a small price to pay. Remember that the 100 BTC would be inaccessible with a traditional 3rd party escrow as well - so that opportunity loss is already - well lost.
Right now, I can lend my BTC for ~5% annual return. If the transaction takes 2 weeks to complete, the added cost (or opportunity loss) is just under .04 BTC. A real cost I will admit. But for me as a buyer, that's not a bad trade-off for what amounts to absolute security that I'll get my stuff or I won't pay for it.

Actually, I've bought most of my bitcoins through bitfloor. They are nowhere near as active as MtGox. Make sure that you place a limit order and the price differential is almost non-existent (fluctuations in price seem to always cover the same territory - but it takes a lot longer on Bitfloor).

As an investment - which is really all this is for me at this point. I think most people would consider that to be small.
X3haloed was proposing Bitfloor as a potential solution to the OP's lament. Which I think it is. But if you have to play around, watching the pricing for a week in order to get such a small quantity, it's not performing the function well.
I just wonder: is MtGox the Qwerty keyboard of BC exchanges? Or, like eBay: so dominant that all competitors dry up and disappear?

I bought 120 BTC's in October last year at $11.00.
As the exchange rate has been going up, co-workers have become more and more interested and I've been selling BTC's to them in ones and twos. So far, I have 5 "converts." A guy bought 2 BTC's off me last week at $141.

They were down (At least the API was down) around noon.
I was trading on Bitfinex all day and they went down about 4 times. And twice last night. That can be nerve-wracking when you can't get out of a position that is rapidly losing value.

A technical analysis of the market would suggest that a correction is due.
Many people don't believe in TA. And there will always be those who say that TA is all BS. And nobody has a perfect record of calling these things, it's more hunch than any logical and well-reasoned opinion.
The TA guys do have one thing right though: A goodly correction will set this market up for another long climb. I'd be holding on for that climb and not be too worried if the market takes a near term tumble.
.02 and all that.

Thanks for providing this information. Sorry that you were the victim of such a theft. I know that it's not easy describing what you did on a public forum and opening yourself up to be ridiculed.
I tend to agree that the iPhone was the source of the problem. There were too many security failures for it to not be something central to all of them.
Oddly, 2FA worked in your disfavor.

There are two points here:
 a) Irreversible transactions is indeed something different and less attractive for a buyer. There was an excellent TED talk a couple of months ago that basically said your online reputation is the most valuable thing that a seller has. If true, and I think that it is true, then the risk is not that great.
 b) Escrow services are very much a part of BTC and are built into the code. An escrow with BTC is easier to set up than it is with any other form of payment.


This is still a currency in its infancy. It is unrealistic to expect it to have the stability of something like the dollar. As it ages - if it ages - it will become more stable. This is also a mindset problem. We think in dollars (Euros, whatever) and frame value in those terms. We do the same thing when we visit a foreign country: keep converting back to our home currency in our head to get a feel for value.


True, but isn't that true of all such technologies. The first time I used PayPal I had to learn how to negotiate the site, how to fund my purchase, etc. I don't  see this as being any more challenging for BTC.




Again, to address both these points: this is a currency in its infancy. A lot of the social learning curve still lies ahead. The US doesn't know how to treat these things yet. If they figure it out, and follow Germany's lead, the current constipation is likely to turn into a floodgate.
Yes, you are right that this isn't dead simple. But it's not all that difficult either. And if Grandma can figure out how to buy junk off eBay and pay with PayPal, she'll be able to figure out how to use BTC.

Gox probably gets a greater percentage of first time buyers since it is the exchange that is always referred to in the MSM press articles. So, yes, I think you're right, their customer base is different and more likely to push the price up.

1BTC = $700 on  right now.
There are many other exchanges. The price is roughly the same on all of them - usually a bit lower than Gox. That's because Gox is having difficulty moving dollars out at the moment (Yea, it sounds backwards I know). Gox is the oldest and either the largest or the 2nd largest exchange.

Agree that it's an interesting equation.
I assume that the downvotes are boos being cast at the author's attitude which, to me at least, came accross as something like:
"I'm so fucking super-smart. I dashed this off on the back of an envelope while I was half looped on Romanée Conti. I am capable of predicting the future of your silly-little market that you plebians find so important, yet I find to be nothing more than the smallest of mental challenges. Now excuse me because I have to be at the gym in 26 minutes."

Mother-in-law received $100K from her sister's estate in Germany. She had it wired to her bank here in the US. A month later the bank sent MIL a check for the full amount with a very brief message that essentially said "we choose not to do business with you." No meaningful explanation was given.
  
She redeposited the money in another bank. So far without incident.  
I have capital gains from Trading BTC on foreign exchanges. I'll need to have some money put into my local bank in order to pay the taxes. And I wonder how that will go.

Actually, that's not true and it reminds me of the old trick question/joke:
Q: What's heavier an ounce of gold or an ounce of feathers?
A: An ounce of gold. Because precious metals like gold are measured in troy ounces which are about 10% heavier than avoirdupois ounce.
Follow up question:
Q2: Which is heavier a pound of gold or a pound of feathers?
A2: A pound of feathers. Because there are only 12 troy ounces in a pound, where there are 16 avdp ounces in a pound.

Bought $2,000 worth over a year ago on Bitfloor. When the price was going up at the beginning of this year I sold some to co-workers and got all of my initial $2,000 back. So the 130 cost me nothing.
But I wish I'd bought more.

I see what you are saying, since you are buying off the "ask" pile. It would be good to have the buy button at the top of that pile. The other way of looking at it is not that I'm buying from the ask pile but that I'm making a new bid hoping to draw the sellers down to my offered price - I'm adding my offer to the green "bids" pile under the green buy button.
If you do even a modest amount of trading, these conventions will become second nature.
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:15:33

Thanks for the link.
Since his complaint seems to be that BTC is too unstable to be a useful currency, I wondered how stable the UK pound has been. [Wikipedia]( indicates that the pound has lost 92% of its value since 1971.
Now it's quite true that a 92% drop over 43 years is not as great as a 50% drop in a week. But the pound has been around for 524 years. I'd suggest that if BTC had that long to stabilize, it's stability would be a whole lot better than that of today's pound. There would be no contest, after all, BTC would be deflating since all practical mining would have long ago ceased.
I was a young man in 1970 working in the UK and earning 16 pounds a week. I saved a little bit of my paycheck and deposited it in National Westminster Bank. I no longer live in the UK, but that's not relevant. What is relevant is the fact that anything I saved back then would be virtually worthless today. If BTC had a 524 year history and my salary was paid in BTC, the money I saved would still have real value today.
So sorry. But lauding the great British pound (or the US dollar) for its stability sounds like your praising the bicycle's superiority in the race with a Ferrari.

This seems to be the way that most of the MtGox hacks are accomplished.
OP, do you understand the question?
@_date: 2013-10-26 13:51:31
It's done by the [US Marshals service Asset Forfeiture Program](
They DO attempt to maximize the $'s that they get when liquidating seized assets. (It's in their fact sheet on the page linked above). It is very unlikely that they would sell through any of the exchanges (Gox, stamp, etc.). They will undoubtedly hold an asset auction and sell the BTC to the highest bidder.
I would expect them to break the total up into smaller lots (e.g. 100 lots of 4,000BTC each). Then auction them "for choice." Which means that the highest bidder gets to pick which lots and how many lots he wants. If he wants, he can take them all. If not, then the second highest bidder gets to choose, etc.
I would *guess* that the bidders would be financial institutions who have the available assets to pay for them. But anyone can sign up and bid - all you need is a letter from your bank indicating that you have certified funds in the amount you wish to bid.
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:10:43
Yea, I see what you mean. It would be a hard sell wouldn't it.
@_date: 2013-10-17 22:42:05
No wait.
Bitcoin has the capability to do this built in. Transfer based on time is one of the more simple [script]( features that were incorporated from the beginning.
Nobody is doing it, but if that's the requirement, I would guess that Bitcoin could respond to such a requirement more quickly than any other payment system.

I've actually bought a small quantity (100 BC) through them. But, because of their size, purchases are slow. It took about a week to get the 100BC. A market order of that size would buy out their entire order book. A similar market order on MtGox would go through unnoticed.
I really hope Bitfloor can grow; unfortunately they seem to be shrinking.

It's not that it's a stupid question. It's just that it's asked twice every day.
If you can figure out a way to get your $ from Gox to bitkonan in a timely manner, then you should do it and make a good profit.
If you can't figure it out, your $'s will just sit at Gox. Doing nothing. And you won't make any money.

* Upvoted because this was a reasonable reply.
* Agreed that part of the attraction is the fact that it's cool.
* However, there is real convenience - at least at the point of sale and in an online transaction.
* Your point has merit: there is a "setup" time/cost that is inconvenient. That "cost" may outweigh the convenience at the POS. This may very well change though if BTC become more generally accepted and used.
The phone has an image of the giftcard on it. Scanning depletes the value in that gift card by the amount of the purchase. You can and should deplete the card to zero (your point 3). There's no reason to discard the card just because it has a small balance.
I'm OK with someone scanning my phone. In the event that the giftcard gets "stolen," losing a giftcard is not as traumatic as losing a credit card.

Their official currency is the US dollar. So, unfortunately for the Ecuadorian government, they don't get the advantage of printing their worries away. But they do have to live with American inflationary whim.
