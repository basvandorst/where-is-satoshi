That's not how it works brother
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:13:32
That's not how the over simplified LN they keep pitching everyone works...but reality is, if it's going to scale and be simple, you won't be buying you coins on coinbase..you'll be buying them directly in your Chase app..which will be a LN hub. They won't ever have to exist on the blockchain, just on Chase's ledger, for you to be able to spend them on any of Chase's channels (to say, starbucks)
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:53:02
It's a way to get fractional reserve into bitcoin. How does nobody see this? It's exactly what Bitcoin was created to stop.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:06:28
Ok, so to use LN you open up a channel with another party locking up funds in that channel, transact all you want and when you're done, you settle and close the channel. That sounds great, but it quickly becomes expensive and a real pain to have a channel open with starbucks, another open with the grocery store, another open with the home depot, another....thats complicated and expensive.
So, we need an easier way...like a central hub that does those channels for us. Like a bank. Ok, so Bank of Bitcoin starts up, is funded with 1000 BTC on the blockchain. Now they can clear all these payments and confirm transactions. Cool. You, me and 998 of our friends open accounts each with the cash equiv of 2 BTC in them...Do those BTC actually exist? So long as they clear on the LN when transactions between end points happen, that's good enough. So long as all of us don't withdraw all of our BTC at the same time, that's also good enough. We have no way of knowing if BoB actually has the funds to cover it's accounts. 
No problem, right? Everything has to settle out when the channel is closed. What is the channels never close? What is channels are only between giant clearing houses like bitcoin banks or a new visa? You kinda need to trust that they have the funds they claim they do. So, it's not a trust less system anymore either.
I know, it seems harmless and like not a big deal...I guess in a way it kind of is...that's how our entire monetary system works right now. But the whole point of the public ledger of bitcoin was to make this scenario impossible.
So much so that it's even in the [genesis block](


@_date: 2017-12-15 23:10:09
Ok, so look at those network diagrams (You &lt;-- 1BTC ----- 1BTC --&gt; Me &lt;-- 1BTC ----- 1BTC --&gt; Alice...) and replace all the middle ones with Wells Fargo, Chase, BofA. 
Why can't they be the ones that fund channels and everyone else just lives on the sidechains? AFAIK, channels don't ever have to close...they can, but they're not required to.
Maybe you're new to bitcoin or want to buy more with fiat. If you buy it from Chase and it never hits the public blockchain, because it's on their LN hub, then it doesn't actually need to exist until you try to transfer it out of your Chase account and onto your own wallet. So then why couldn't they sell more bitcoins then they actually have?
That's not how it's supposed to work, but why can't it work like that? I'm not trying to be inflammatory or argumentative, I just haven't seen any reason why it can't work like this. And if it can, then it eventually will. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:21:34
Cool! Just reinvented fractional reserve banking!
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:54:57
Um, no. It't not. You're telling me that I have to open a channel with every vendor I want to spend my bitcoins with AND I have to lock up funds in that channel? How is that an improvement over onchain transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:14:40
How else is it going to work? Are you really going to lock up funds in channels with every merchant you want to spend with?
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:18:41
Enter lightning network and private ledgers....
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:36:09
Sure. Originally they are. But let's say I run a hub and I fund it with 100BTC. Then I start selling them for fiat for use on LN. Why can't I sell 120 BTC one at a time? How would you know I didn't still have all 100btc?
Let's say I'm Chase and I provide a wallet service and run a LN hub that has ties to all your favorite merchants and coffee shops.
Private ledgers will lead to fractional reserve.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:59:43
forest for the trees brother. I understand what you're saying, you're just not seeing the bigger picture...
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:58:26
Nope. Wrong again. What you are describing are onchain transactions. I suggest you read this:
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:32:58
Technical reason: channels aren't required to close.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:06:22
Will this still work with difficulty that adjusts every block? Wouldn't the huge influx of hash power just pump the difficulty higher?
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:48:23
Ya, that's they point. Routing through other nodes is how it will work. Channels between 2 parties just to buy coffee is ridiculous. However:


So your intermediary hubs will need some serious coin...like a bank.
Also on that stackexchange link:
 &gt; Which would make it possible to create one big network, where most transactions happen off chain
Which also supports public blockchain bitcoin as a setttlement layer...like between banks. Banks who have their own private ledgers for transactions on the LN
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:53:18
Do you understand bitcoin? Like at all? 
The public ledger is the reason it's trustless. Everyone can see wether you have the coins or you don't. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:19:42
And then there's the whole trust issue...
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:20:00
Exactly....and everything after that requires you to trust the intermediary nodes until the payment channel is closed. What if those blockchain pegs are only done by large financial institutions and regular people just use those bank's wallet services? You really haven't thought this all the way through, have you?
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:46:50
I understand what you're saying but all that assumes that the channel closes...which is the way it's supposed to work. I get it and it makes sense. All I'm saying is what if channels don't close? I haven't seen anything in the spec that requires them to close.
I get that it's not supposed to work that way but nothing is stopping it from working that way either. 
So if you never own Bitcoin on the blockchain and only on LN (like you aquired them through your LN enabled bank), you can buy your coffee and make your transactions quickly and cheaply...but you'll never actually own Bitcoin in the way we have for the last 5 years until you try to transfer it from your LN bank wallet to your regular non LN wallet. So long as nobody has incentives to do that (like crazy high fees to discourage bank runs) then there's a whole lot of wiggle room on balance sheets that public eyes will never see.
That was the point of the message encoded into the Genesis block. Bitcoin's gift to the world was a public ledger that everyone could use. Get rid of that (by putting tx on LN) and you've just reinvented visa...
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:05:20
Oh so the hub's ledgers are public and viewable/verifiable by anyone? Neat
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:00:39
Could those be tipping services?
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:05:38
You do realize that you can get an i5 NUC or shit an i3 laptop off Amazon for like $300 right? You do realize that the US isn't exactly at the forefront of world wide internet speed, right? You do realize that $7k BTC with $10 fees isn't exactly attractive to 3rd world countries that could eat a week off $10 right?
None of your arguments pass the smell test. 
And the kicker is, the mempool is probably choking your rpi right now anyhow, so how did that 1mb block help?
Oh right.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:12:00
And no, that's not what the core devs are focusing on. They're focusing on making the world wide blockchain a settlement layer for side chains. Sidechains with no public ledger that you won't sync on your rpi. How long do you think it will take Chase to get in the lightning hub business? How convenient would it be to be able to buy "BTC" directly on the chase app on your phone straight from their lightning hub? Cool! Now you can go buy coffee with BTC cause Starbucks is connected to their hub too!
You just reinvented our current banking system. I guess we'll need government mandated health checks for lightning hubs to make sure they have enough reserve BTC.

It sounded like he said gigabyte blocks in 10+ years...does that really sound crazy? Who had gigabit internet 10 years ago? Lots of people have it now...at least 100mb. I can probably dig up a 10 year old laptop with enough computing power to handle 2MB blocks too. We have 16core desktops with 16GB of ram today. Just that thought 10 or 15 years ago sounded crazy. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:38:34
Exactly! We've just recreated visa! So banks open channels between themselves and bitvisa. Starbucks does too. You move your BTC to your bank of Bitcoin account. Now you can transact with all their merchants like Starbucks. Here's the other really clever part. Hubs have their own ledger and confirm transactions. Who's to say they can't confirm transactions that they don't have funds to cover? How would anyone even know if they did?
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:15:18
Non public ledgers on lightning hubs is not sound money.
The average person still needs to go out and buy a RPi though, right? To secure the network? Your old laptop with a broken screen has more memory and processing power than a RPi. None of your arguments make any sense to anyone that actually stops to think about it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:03:18
Ya and apple was still kinda shit in 1999...wasn't that still in the OS9 days? Man I hated OS9!
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:43:25
Fair enough. I appreciate your graceful response and I'm sorry for getting kind of dickish. I understand and agree with most of your points except why and how it's a store of value. The Genesis block references a bank bailout and Bitcoin was supposed to be so transparent it wouldn't allow that to happen again. Second layers without public ledgers feels to me like we're going backwards, not forwards. That's all.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:42:57
Are you actually serious? Have you ever been to r/homelab? For $200 you could pick up a second hand server that will sync gigabyte blocks without breaking a sweat. Have you ever downloaded anything p2p? 10 or even 5 years ago a gigabyte movie download seemed crazy to me...now couchpotato downloads 16GB movies in an instant without me even realizing. 
You're right that a cluster of rpi won't be able to deal, but seriously? That's not even *remotely* what they were intended for. What kind of moron is going to run bitcoind on an rpi? Should it run on dd-wrt too? What about my fridge?
And what actual ISP isn't going to be able to keep up? Have you ever actually been to a data center? Come on now.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:19:39
Also anyone that can stream Netflix right now has way more than enough bandwidth to download 1 gigabyte in less than 10 minutes. And nobody is even talking about 1 gigabyte right now. We're talking 2 megabytes. You probably couldn't stream Netflix 10 years ago. You don't think the ability to stream HD will seem quaint in 10 years?
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:33:56
Clearly you don't work in IT

Off chain balances and transactions in BTC? Like say you open a channel with Bank of Bitcoinia and take out a 20 BTC loan and so does Joe and so does Schmoe. Does BoB really need to have 60BTC take make those loans? Not in the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:03:22
That's exactly how it works. Off chain transactions. This whole time you really thought it was about cups of coffee?
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:20:09
"The payment channels allow participants to transfer money to each other without having to make all their transactions public on the blockchain. "
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:41:16
Sorry I'm on mobile, was supposed to be same...if your LN transactions happen off chain, on BoB's ledger then what's preventing them from loaning out the same coins multiple times? Onchain the bank owns all the coins. On the side chain they can loan them out as often as they want.
That's why they pushed so damn hard for you coffee buying sidechain. It's an overly complicated solution to the full blocks problem.... that magically enables all the things we never wanted.
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:36:26
Exactly. And how many times can they loan the second coins when it's off chain? LN is not loans, but it was necessary to be able to get to fractional reserve. Now that there can be more than one ledger that is.
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:46:21
If only they had some way to take the loan transactions off the chain...like some sort of side chain that was lightning fast...
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:36:23
Honestly not trolling at all. I just don't understand how it couldn't work like that? Not a big blocker troll, I just feel like it's an overly complicated solution that introduces more potential problems that it solves.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:56:05
My point is lightning network relies on multiple ledgers, not one single ledger where everything has to balance out. I understand that real Bitcoin needs to be locked up and both parties can close the channel and everything has to balance out when the channel closes, but what if they never close...like what if that's just used between banks? What if that's just how banks fund their reserve and then on their private ledgers as payment hubs they can multiply coins by making customer balances on their ledger equal more than they actually have in reserve?
I feel like we just reinvented the current financial system but with Bitcoin instead of cash. My mom isn't going to open a payment channel and lock up funds so she can buy a coffee in the morning...that's complicated and hard. Why not just get an account at BoBTC and let them deal with creating payment channels with Starbucks? Do you really expect average Joes to create payment channels for every place they want to shop? That's 100x more complicated than any current system including making BTC payments right now (which is too complicated for them). Maybe banks won't want to deal with 1000s of payment channels either so the next visa is born too.
Multiple private ledgers will lead to fractional reserve banking guaranteed.
Are bigger and bigger blocks the answer forever? Probably not. But complaining about not being able to run a node on a RPi is just retarded. You can get an i5 NUC with a multi TB HD for less than $500. No you won't have enough bandwidth over dialup either but using that as a reason to keep blocks small is equally disingenuous.
