I am confused how your account ended up getting locked. He tried to hack your account? Maybe through your email? I use WF surepay from time to time and would like to know more info if you can provide. Thanks.

This is awesome. The people on the nascar website are genuinely butt hurt that Josh Wise won.

As a person in the US, it would seem much easier to me to trade on stamp and withdrawl to coinbase.
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:08:42
Well, then maybe you could use btc-e but that seems semi sketchy as well.
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:52:50
Mine wasn't pending. I was already charged. I just called my bank and filed a dispute and they had no problem doing it since I did not get what I paid for. I tried hanging in there for simplex because I like their service but no communication is unacceptable.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:47:07
Well that sucks, but I am glad to know I am not the only one. I will keep you posted on what happens.
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:59:35
This is just what happens when the price goes up substantially, people cash out and take profits, the price dips and then it goes back up... hopefully.
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:00:15
I still havent heard shit. I'm opening another ticket. This is ridiculous. I want a refund.
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:53:27
Still have not received anything from them. I called my bank and filed a dispute. They had no problem doing it as I had not received what I had paid for.
@_date: 2013-06-18 19:27:33
clear your cache. BTC-e is not a scam, at least has never scammed me, and I have moved plenty of BTC and LTC in and out of there. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 15:58:50
Sorry, I didn't know asking you to prove something would hurt your feelings so bad. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2013-11-01 17:02:15
Just guessing here as I have never actually used the tracking number, but I imagine it would be something used by their support staff to get information on your transactions. I would include that tracking number in any correspondence between you and coinbase.

This. I bought from coinbase 2 nights ago. It kept saying that they had hit their limit but I just refreshed the page a few times within an hour and was able to buy.
@_date: 2013-03-28 03:42:45
Just bought my first one tonight as well. I'm super excited to see what the future holds for bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-07-23 18:51:04
Cool, thanks for the response Brian.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:14:25
I also bought in at todays prices from coinbase. Just gotta keep trying to you dont see that daily limit message anymore.
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:50:06
I'm sure when they see over over 10k just randomly pop up in your bank account, it may set off some red flags.
@_date: 2013-07-12 16:34:49
lol keep telling yourself that.
@_date: 2013-07-11 18:59:25
Ha beat me to the post. I use  
7 euros or ~ 9 bucks a month. They give bigger discounts if you buy multiple months.
@_date: 2013-05-15 21:03:56
Yeah, I was thinking about that. Hopefully his lawyer can stress that in court but at the same time, I think he knew this would happen. Everyone has been calling bitcoin a virtual currency/crypto-currency/online-currency (key being currency) for a while. I'm thinking he should have been proactive and registered as a MSB and maybe this would have been avoided. Who knows...
@_date: 2013-07-12 15:39:35
It will get me far because I base my speculation on proof and probability. Since you can't provide any proof for your statement, I'll take it with a grain of salt and not give it any serious consideration. If you could provide proof, I would do otherwise. I think anyone who is serious about money would agree. I have seen people stating that Gox is going to carry litecoin for the past 2-3 months. Nothing has come of it. Why should I believe you unless you have proof?
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:47:00
Thanks for this article, I was actually looking into ASICminer earlier today. You answered all my questions!
@_date: 2013-04-20 18:33:14
ive been using coinbase for about a month and a half now and have purchased and sold several coins without any problems. I like coinbase.

Did you guys RTFA? It says that when Mark Karpeles, the president and CEO of Mt. Gox was opening the account with Wells Fargo, he "specifically denied he was going to get into the currency exchange business."
He lied on the application. No wonder they are going after him. He stated that they do not exchange currencies. We all know that mtgox definitely exchanges currencies. 
@_date: 2013-07-11 20:53:46
Thank you! Very kind.
@_date: 2013-05-08 16:55:03
Does anyone know when they will start taking orders?
**edit. Official Terrahash thread on bitcointalk
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:23:16
yeah, I had no idea this could happen. Care to tell us what state you are in OP? In my experience, as long as you had the cash, no questions asked.
@_date: 2013-07-12 12:11:00
Prove that Gox confirmed that with you.
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:26:13
Thank you for this.
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:13:18
bitstamp back up to 115.00
edit* 106.00 now
@_date: 2013-07-12 14:14:47
Then it is safe to say you are bullshitting. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-05-15 13:58:50
coinbase if your in the US and have a bank account.
@_date: 2013-07-22 18:15:46
I've had the same thing happen with smaller purchases (between .2 and 1 btc). After waiting about an hour, i get a verification email saying that the BTC is now in my account. Last week, the instant purchase was instant. Now it seems to be taking an hour or so. Wait about an hour and see if you are able to transfer it now.
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:21:05
I made my first purchase this weekend as well. My vpn subscription ran out from airvpn. I usually use paypal but noticed they had a bitcoins logo, so I thought, "awesome, ill pay in bitcoins" and now I have a 3 month subscription purchased with bitcoin. pretty sweet!
@_date: 2013-07-22 18:23:22
O wow, day five. I misread your OP. That stinks. Hopefully customer service gets to you. I have no idea why this would happen. Sorry.
@_date: 2013-05-17 16:02:36
taking an ISP down during a DDoS attack is not unheard of. Especially an ISP that doesnt have much bandwidth or they have shitty equipment.
@_date: 2013-05-10 21:12:56
They are still waiting on certain things to come through, like the avalon chips and klondike design.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:41:53
Awesome review. Glad it worked out so well for you. Sounds like a great overall experience.
