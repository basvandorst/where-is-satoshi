For reals. If the cops are corrupt as they say what's to stop them from running a racket for protection money?

This headline sounds like a wankfest.

Because it is... I don't trust my community to not break into my apartment and steal all if my cash.
When is the last time you heard if a bank robbery?

I always wank when people tell me I'm subverting the system by accruing money.
