Where can we see the changelist ?

Its visual very nice approach but to understand what you were trying to convey is very difficult, this lack of maybe popups tooltips of explanation on each component .      
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:26:05
Very impressive  ! I'm thinking it would be brilliant to see a video how you do this .

If ETF will be approved , what do you think the reasonable price of bitcoin next ATH will be ?

3 years using btc-e , see no reason to worry.

Great solution and I believe it should be more published and viewed by the community . 
But , I find it very hard to start using Joinmarket with all this installations .
Do you see any time in the future where this functionality can be included in wallets such as bitcoin QT or even mobile wallets mycelium bread wallet as a feature  ?

outputs with "OP_RETURN" are not saved as UTXO ,only stored in the blockchain memory. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 10:36:45
Thinking about this again I don't say that bitcoin is an optimal solution , I can see breakthrough implementation such as WimbleMimble superior ( if / when release ) . I'm saying that for now solutions to bring a change in lowering fees and fast confirmations time arm the top property of bitcoin ( decentralization ) .

ELI5 "Opt into RBF When Sending" , please . 
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:11:27
Vote should be function of bitcoin amount one holds
I wonder if there is anon system for it
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:52:59
So the bug is in the electrum implementation, not in the bip itself ?

So you are wrong my friend. Money need to have no other function than medium of exchange. I’m might be wrong but that as far as I read in economics books by hykes
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:23:43
I recommend reading “the bitcoin standard” detailed information why bitcoin is better then gold to become the standard of money.
1. It is not controllable by any authority. Still governments control the gold in the central banks.
2.It is easier to transport 
3.it is easier to use it as payments medium of exchange, especially with second layer

@_date: 2018-11-30 17:10:13
If you know users addresses then you can check balance by date using a 3rd party, I think blockchain info and for safety and trustless method run full node and do the check yourself.
@_date: 2016-09-03 20:57:09
What do we have here ? 
@_date: 2019-09-04 18:40:23
This is too shallow argument, the medium of exchange that is the hardest to create overtime will be worth more than others that are easier to create, thereby bitcoin will be worth more and more fiat with time. You cannot manipulate the price of gold with seashells.

Why not stay the same and realize that bitcoin is expensive store of value system / payments , I think people should buy coffee with different currency . It's time to understand that you don't transfer 1 dollar in Brink's car . 
@_date: 2016-10-31 07:56:43
you forgot the calculate market buy sell , If core 25% miners it is more expensive to mine coins , so coins will be more expensive to buy as well , price goes up -&gt; more will join . in crypto world nothing is black and white :)

I'm asking , not saying .

Where did you get this statistics ?

1 Image can replace 1000 words , people will go to sleep.
Try using PPT animation it will work great , not too complicated animation .

Being very uneducated in cryptography I cannot bring a solution but wonder why there is no mathematical cryptography answer to this requirement...
1. The receiver has a public address which corresponds to one private key he owns.
2. Each payment to this address will add a locking script in a way that doesn’t revel the public address 
3. The receiver can see if there are utxo locked that his private key can open
