Its all about probability. Everything can be replaced one day. No one had thought one day telephone sets will be replaced by some pocket sized mobile phones.  Telegrams, typewriters, VCR and many more. These were in widespread use but got replaced by newer and cooler tech. But IBM, Microsoft, Ford, Sony, Honda, Apple and many more are still here.
Facebook replaced MySpace because it was relatively easier to come up with something better with very small investment. But its too hard to replace Facebook now and the reason is Network Effects. You can build a super cool social media platform by investing millions of dollars but how will you get millions of users. Google launched Allo and you know what happened. Because no will switch from WhatsApp to Allo, because all my people are on WhatsApp . 
You need far far better tech to make users switch like Tesla is doing with cars. It's not that TCP/IP is a very good protocol( it's bad from a design point of view ) but Internet still runs on it and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future because it's really hard to replace the entire infrastructure of the Internet in favor of some new protocol. 
To replace Bitcoin, you need something that is many times as secure as bitcoin and that will need enormous amount of money and can still fail. Who will risk that?
Convincing millions of people is not easy and actually very very hard when it comes to money.

Definitely if Bitcoin miners want so.

Correct. It's not as big as Google and others in terms of users but still quite big. About 22 million users and it's 7 years old. Google can be blocked by any country at will. Good luck banning Bitcoin. People won't care if Google goes bankrupt tomorrow, there are other players ready like Bing. But they do care if it's Citibank or JPM Chase. 
and you know why. Convincing even a few thousand is hard when its about safety of your hard earned money.
And there is nothing as secure in this world as Bitcoin network as their is no central server you can hack, there is no CEO or CTO you can force to do something like putting a backdoor(and it's open source anyway). It has got enormous amount of hashing power, so much so not even the goverment of USA or China can harm it.  It would have been possible back in 2013  or 2014 but not now.

Well, in India, it's maximum one hour from any bank to any other bank for any amount.  For amounts less than USD 1500, it's instant. The main advantage of crypto over fiat is when you do a cross border transaction.

No one can. Not even The president of United states

Nothing would take it to zero.
