Always check their rating and chat them up first before you make any transactions. I previously used Paxful and 1 out of 5 trades tried to scam me, so be extra vigilant. Diligently search them up, cross check their feedback before purchasing.

You stopped the loss and exited just in time ;)

This is exactly what Andreas (AA) did. People like Ver can scoff all they want for selling and 'not believing' or not putting his money where his mouth is, but sometimes, we have to choose our battles. 
While some people may sit in piles of cash and reserves (hello there, banks!), some people just don't have the same luxury to do so. 
There's no point shaming such people who choose to fulfill their family/financial duties and obligations though. 
You, my friend, did the right thing and I salute you for it.

You should wait for when Bitcoin price goes down (dip or red) before buying again and welcome to the crypto world :)

This. This is the reason why we rebel against the traditional systems that try as much as they can to control the decentralized nature of Blockchain. 
If we kept sticking to the old saying "But, you're just one person, it's not going to affect anything", we wouldn't have seen how Andreas and other great people are actually rewarded from years and years of hard work. 
I, for one, still believe that humanity will triumph against greed.

This is why I will not invest in Ripple. Banks control them.

I feel both excited and shared for the newbies who get intrigued by the price heights. While it's a good position to be in for Bitcoin to go even more mainstream, it can be disheartening for those who do not necessarily understand and see the powerful underlying technology that makes Bitcoin - well, Bitcoin. 
It takes aware the much abused control previously held by banks and governments and their corrupt cronies.
Bitcoin is more than just a store value. It's more than just a currency or commodity that one can trade for profits. 
While these are certainly good utilities (just a few of the limitless possibilities), having an understanding of Bitcoin's true value and importance will give one better peace of mind amidst all the price speculations and uncertainties brought by CBOE, CME and all the FUD caused by many Wall Streets who are only here mainly and purely to make profits.
