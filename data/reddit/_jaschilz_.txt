It's not pretty, but I wanted to show how easy it was to integrate your favorite web framework with your favorite lightning network client. I'm running LND in neutrino mode on a nano AWS instance, although I had to bump it to small to compile LND.
The critical integration bit is about 30 lines of code in [

Thanks. It looks like LND had crashed. It might be my fault running it on a nano instance. I'll try bumping up the resources if it happens again.

I can definitely appreciate what you're saying. To be clear to anyone else reading, Acinq's Strike lightning payment service *is* custodial. You receive lightning payments into their custodial wallet, and then get consolidated payouts on-chain.
I personally wouldn't use a custodial wallet for spending. And I can appreciate anyone who doesn't want to use a custodial service at all. If you *are* willing to use custodial services, then Strike does offer some scaling, stability, and availability advantages.
If you *aren't* willing to use any custodial services, then I definitely agree with you regarding LND. But I would point out that if your site got popular, then you would have to address some scaling and engineering questions for LND.
Edit: "and availability"

If you'd like to try out the code, it's easy to make testnet payments with HTLC.me's custodial testnet lightning wallet.

It's not the model, but it's an option.
In terms of mainnet lightning wallets I've used the LND client (non-custodial, command line), desktop eclair (non-custodial, graphical), and android eclair (non-custodial). Of these, I find that android eclair is really slick.
However, Strike (the backend Acinq lightning network payment service that this library uses) *is* custodial. You receive lightning network payments into their custodial wallet and then you can receive consolidated payouts on-chain.

Ha. That's welcome feedback!
I should probably add something along those lines to the disclaimer. I'd say that SMS 2FA is probably good against casual theft/impersonation. It's like locking your doors: it will stop your neighboor from coming in, but a determined thief will come in through the windows.
I've thought about integrating with some kind of device-based 2FA. I might research that more.

The Shango wallet tries to do this. They've made an android lightning wallet, and when you set it up it spins up an LND node in the cloud.
I really admire LND's emphasis on RPC: you can have a single node running 24-7 at home or in the cloud, and then a bunch of thin lightning wallets that work by connecting to this node.
If we see mass adoption, that node could be hosted by a third party, or it could be built into consumer hardware like your home internet router.

Nice! I'm looking into it.

It took me a while to get this. :P
I wasn't going to call out everyone who inspired me. But you were my number one inspiration for sure!
Edit: Seriously, though. I was inspired by your minimalist design.
@_date: 2018-11-30 03:58:53
Got it! I can see how that adds value.

I'm working on a 2FA service: no need to sign up for a service, you just pay me a few cents on the Lightning Network.
The basic flow is RESTish and looks like this:
1. You send me a phone number.
2. My response includes a confirmation code and a lightning invoice.
3. When you pay the lighting invoice, I send the confirmation code to the phone number you gave me.
4. Then you ask your visitor for the confirmation code.
That's basically it, although there are some implementational details like making sure that you can't use my service to spam a phone number.
I'll check out your projects!

I agree! I'm not on indiehackers, but I do feel like there should be some resource for people to talk about Bitcoin ecosystem development. I'm not sure what that is.
I'm just to the point of deploying my API. I've got the documentation at  and hope to have the service up and running soon.

I've been picturing micropayments of, like 5 cents for reading a news article. And I'd want to click for that. But I could imagine pages charging half a cent and maybe I wouldn't want to click for that.
I would want: 
  1. Some kind of protection inside of the browser to make sure that you really, deliberately wanted to visit this page that you're paying for: it wouldn't be good if a web site could put you into some kind of an endless redirect and get half a cent each time. This probably isn't too hard to solve.
  2. The browser to give you some kind of unobtrusive notice about the fee that you just paid.
Maybe you could do this with a 402 Payment Required response. The W3C hasn't told us how to use it: it's "reserved for future use". But maybe you could put a payment URI into a Location header.
Including u/NimbleBodhi in case the Joule team has any thoughts. (:

That's what I was going for. :P

Neutrino removes the need to run a full Bitcoin node. But you'll still need to run a full lightning node: your lightning node can use Neutrino instead of a full Bitcoin node like btcd in order to keep synced with the Bitcoin blockchain, but you still have to have a full lightning node in order to issue and receive payments.
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:07:02
Nice! 
Someone else mentioned the [W3C Payment Handler API]( I've glanced over it, and it seems like URIs are all we need for lightning payments.
Open question for anyone who knows: what does the payment handler API offer to our ecosystem that payment URIs don't?
@_date: 2018-11-30 07:22:40
Awesome, and thank you! (:
In this case the 2FA is over SMS, which costs about a penny for me to send, depending on the destination. So the cost covers that, plus server hosting and a bit of profit, if it ever became popular.
@_date: 2018-11-30 04:15:36
I made this because what excites me about cryptocurrency is computer-to-computer micropayments. I think that computers will soon be exchanging tiny payments for small services as easily as they're exchanging small pieces of information today over web services and APIs.
The best use I can imagine for this: you could put your phone number into your Raspiblitz lightning node when you set it up, and then it could 2FA you before letting you perform sensitive functions like retrieving your admin macaroon.

Sweet! I'll drop a link to the Python wrapper I made: [ If you shoot the Acinq team an e-mail, they might give your library some extra visibility.
I'm working on a Lightning Network enabled web service/API: I'm excited about computer-to-computer micropayments. Do you have any projects in mind for this Ruby wrapper?

People are running lnd (and other clients) on mainnet. So the bug reports you see there reflect bugs that would/do exist on their mainnet client. Some additional considerations exist on mainnet (like there's a fee market on mainnet so there's a greater hazard of under feeing a mainnet txn), but the concerns are pretty similar between the two.
Edit to add: it's not recommended  or supported to run these clients on mainnet yet. Running lnd on mainnet requires altering some code and recompiling.

One standard is simple URIs. For example, here's a lightning invoice that I generated from y'alls:
(Oops, looks like reddit won't convert that into a link for us.)
If you click on that link and you have a program on your computer/phone that's registered to handle "lightning" URIs, then the link will be fed to that program. Or if you have a browser plugin, the browser plugin can catch it.
