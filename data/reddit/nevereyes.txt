So... was this the pump and dump?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:33:01
If you view this as a stock and not a currency, sure I guess.
Perhaps I’m reacting to this in the context that the Bitcoin Cash thing earlier this week didn’t taste right.
HODL and zig when they zag!

Congrats! That’s awesome.
I’m planning on HODL-ing  for the same tax reasons.. although, if it keeps at this rate leading into WallStreet Time I might take some profits...
....and be ready to reinvest if it gets shorted and dumped.
If that’s what happens, I could see that move of pumping/shorting/dumping happening on a regular basis... at which point I think some kind of regulation would occur. Seems impossible that it’d be allowed to happen over and over. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:08
Is this all one big stress test for Wall Street? Good grief.. that was just insanity to watch live.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:36:49
I think it’s incredibly fucked up that they lock out users like this.
I do not believe this is a technical glitch.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:01:25
.. and now we’re up.. with tons of volume.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:05:09
It succeeded in that they crashed exchanges though..that troubles me.
I wasn’t going to sell, but knowing I could matters. 
19.5k popped up, and it all went up in flames.
The scaling has got to be unbelievably challenging. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:12:31
This is how regulation happens.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:18:45
No regulated exchange would lock you out of making a move.
If I want to sell at $20, and buy at 19K I should be allowed to.
What I WAS trying to do was buy when it dipped below 12K. That lockout was done on purpose, and is not cool.

I deploy the dollar cost averaging tactic, and of course DRIP reinvesting in the stock market... not yet in this. 
The volatility lends itself to a little bit of timing I think... of course, everybody is a genius when it goes up 1000% every day!
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:52:26
Thanks for the tip...
The upside if it is Wall Street is we’ll be able to identify this pattern and ride it... if it’s an easy $$ score they’ll do it more than once.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:21:29
What is driving the price up like this?
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:35:53
2016: How about this election!...
Was more what I was hearing. 
This year should be a hoot.  ��
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:11:45
Your balls.... it’s what’s for dinner.
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:20:46
Man, this is the question I struggle with.
I guess since the cat is out of the bag and it would require a global type of ban, which seems impossible.
But with everything, regulation has to be coming in some form.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:19:39
Is this”undefeated” or is this proof of concept that a select few can cause the appearance of demand based on an incoming event, push the price up, and then sell as the split is cancelled?
Not asking to be confrontational, just trying to understand this angle that this is “good”, and not a market manipulation. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:21:51
I was waiting for the... “and then Undertaker threw Mankind off the top of the cage”... part.

Very well put.
In order for it to truly be of value people HAVE to use it, not just buy and sit on it.
The reality I think is, if Bitcoin wants to pop that bubble of being integrated into everyday use, it will come at the cost of regulations.
What I'm doing, much like the stock market, is watching the ups and downs. There is money to be made in something as volatile as this. Set a floor/ceiling threshold, stick to it, and you can make some money. 
Set tons of alerts, or auto trades at specific numbers you feel comfortable with, and when you can pull out whatever your initial investment was so that you're playing with the icing on the cake and not the whole cake.

Got it. Thank you guys.
I wasn't aware of the "spread", only the fee per transaction. 
That should be its own line, or be made more apparent for us newbies that are used to trading stocks.
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:34:53
When I trade, the ticker is accurate to the "buy" price.
There's a fee per trade, but never a difference in buy price.
I understand the concept of the "spread", just didn't realize that's what was happening. 
My point being, perhaps that spread should be included on the fee line, or it's own line to make it clear.
