That's a neat idea. I am passionate about the project but I don't know how to approach the dual ideas of seeking payment for educating people about something they may not be convinced they need.

I was annoyed that the writer used an iphone.  A great opportunity to showcase how seamless and smooth transacting can be was squandered because of Apple.

Wow. Is your son black?
@_date: 2014-11-10 03:14:39
You can't ban math...well, you can but you'd look like a fool.
@_date: 2014-08-10 01:11:09
LOL. Seriously you've missed a really clever reference. I'm no jackass I'm a Boss

I ain't steppin outta shit.  All my papers legit. Well, do you mind if I look around the car a Lil bit? Well, my glove compartments locked and so's the trunk in the back and I know my rights so you gon need a warrant for that!

I've been doing that. Bring it into conversation whenever I can. I've even had friends add a wallet to their phone then sent them some bitcoin so they can experience the seamless quality. The idea that no bank was involved, permission was not required and if we were not friends our identities would be secure. Sometimes the lightbulb goes off in their head, sometimes they just look at me.

Play on the Allstate thing. Are you in good hands?

This is a great step. It's funny because this weekend I was at a wedding and I brought up Bitcoin at dinner. The blank stares and eye rolling really made me feel a bit foolish. Then I heard his story on the news this morning.  Made me smile. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 06:53:56
Damn. It feels good to be a banksta
@_date: 2014-09-10 03:56:19
What about payment processors? Do they actively seek merchants through salespeople?

Like I already mentioned. It's a play on a scene from one of the best shows ever. It's slightly obscure but I know someone gets it. It's really very clever. Trust me. Or ask me nicely for a hint

My sister travelled to Ghana recently and I tried to encourage her to attend a bitcoin meetup. So she could learn and I could find out how the industry is developing there. She acted like I had advised her to attend a criminal workshop. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 06:08:11
Great development. Glad to read this.

Not if you're white.

I want to do the same thing! I'm wondering how you approach the food truck operators?  Do you charge them as a consultant?    Do you give them pamphlets? 
@_date: 2014-05-08 06:44:29
Never been tipped
@_date: 2014-09-23 00:42:25
Bitcoin jeopardy! Awesome. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 23:27:03
I'm actually in Vancouver canada.  People are very tech savvy here and I see enormous potential for merchant adoption with the proliferation of food trucks for one. Awareness is the thing now. Not a lot of people know about it and I'd love to be part of cultivating awareness and ultimately adoption and use. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 23:36:20
Thanks. Very good info and perspective

That's exactly how the FBI rolls.

I've got 7.5. Bought btwn 250 and 750
@_date: 2014-08-09 07:51:23
Nope. A great reference went over your dumb head. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 23:33:39
You've missed the point. It is a relevant analogy for the times we live in

It's too bad Alibaba banned Bitcoin in January.  Mostly I suspect to placate the Chinese government.  
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:00:50
Dude I totally feel you. My most unpleasant dealings in life have been interactions with banking officials.  It's like they are trained to find an opportunity to say no. When I heard about the concept of bitcoin it filled me with excitement.  The idea that I am in charge of my money. Revolutionary.  
@_date: 2016-03-14 06:33:43
Look up the Internet of things...should give you some insight
@_date: 2016-02-26 03:31:51
No. But I should have. I tipped with btc andthey were scratching their heads trying to figure out what to do
@_date: 2015-04-28 04:39:59
It is revolutionary in its ease and simplicity.

I love this idea. I have never heard of this. Are you available in canada?   Is the app available for blackberry?
