on hope, like 99% of the people long on BTC with their $500 invested here 
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:58:22
Traditional markets gave you 22% in 2017.  (S&amp;P500)
without the big drops or volatility and with actual value behind it
so what you say is factual completely wrong. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:50:51
On a forum. I was mining with my laptop in 2009, like a few 100  bitcoins an hour, then my fan of my laptop started blowing really hard, and i said fuck that mining shit that ain't good for my laptop. Then i just probably a few weeks later wiped my hd to install another linux distro and that was it. 
TL:DR mined probably 200 to 300 bitcoins, deleted HD didn't give a shit, almost a decade ago.

why? a shutdown means less spending and less borrowing so stronger USD
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:59:45


@_date: 2018-01-17 07:59:08
Yeah I really don't get that, you're losing money, you see it's going down? Why don't you cut your losses and jump in later when it's much lower and it's going up again? I mean, what you guys do with HODL is like the worse thing you can do as an investor in a losing position. 
That risk management HODL is a joke. 
Oh wait, they are not investors, they are gamblers, gambling. OK GOT IT. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:17:38
The amount of bullshit in your post is stunning. 
 * USD does not has any bad inflation wtf are you talking about
 * Past due for economic crash? Companies have never been so profitable as they are today and their cash situation has never been this healthy (debt ratio) Unemployment is at all time low since years and years. Companies just got a huge gift with the huge tax cut which will boost the economy even more
You have no idea what you are talking about, please go do something else in life. Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:22:16
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:01:49
Absolutely false again. 
Around 50% of the Americans pay 0% tax. 
The other ones just got a huge tax cut meaning they have more to spend. 
You need to educate yourself instead of spitting out this nonsense which is factual completely wrong. I don't blame you, you're just part of somebody's agenda. I'm just asking you to educate yourself. Thanks.

@_date: 2017-12-31 09:52:45
you should, it just broke out to the downside, i think it's heading for 8k to 5k maybe even back to $400
why? The world got the news that bitcoin - the alternative currency -= is not working to do a payment in the shop. 
there's no question that cryptocurrency will be a thing in the near future and blockchain will be implemented in our lives but bitcoin won't be a part of it, even if it could technically, which it can't, governments will never allow that, like the boss of the FED said, they are looking to  make their own cryptocurrency linked to USDollar putting the value of bitcoin at $0,02 or something like that. Overnight. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 03:22:51
This is correct. That includes the big exchanges, it's unregulated, they can do whatever, do you think these big guys don't have sources? 
@_date: 2018-09-18 18:41:45

Bloodbath. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 07:53:39
Remember the economy is crazy booming, once it comes down, if it is every going happen, it's not going to look good when you say on your CV: '2018-2020 Owner Sail to Martha's Vineyard' and then you are going to compete with all the others with big fat CVs and a big network all looking for a job. 
Income streams like yours can do well when people have a lot of money to spend, because of the current economy, this will work for you, but as said, when it comes down, business like you are the first to go from 100 to litterally 0. 
I've seen it over and over. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 18:20:48
they pumped it up, trying to get retail guys in, selling their inventory day by day and then when it was high enough smashed the rest of their inventory on the market 
what do you think these guys do who bought a huge amount of bitcoins 4 years ago? 
they are dumping it day by day while the price is high
hence, they might buy it up to lure other people in
@_date: 2018-09-11 16:08:07
lol like anyone really thought that countries where going to give up the power to control a currency
what are fools thinking
@_date: 2018-09-08 19:06:35
why do you want to fight the trend? If we turn bullish again i will stop shorting and go long
for last months shorting always worked, i will stop doing it when it doesn't work anymore, i have already such a profit buffer it can shoot to 60k and i'm still in the green

@_date: 2018-08-08 17:15:47
This is incorrect. This is not a zero sum game. The BTC was created out of nothing. There wasn't a counter party from the start. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 06:31:27
dumb because they don't want to throw good money after bad?

Why, this is not how markets work, this could have been a short seller, who is just going to try to buy it lower to give that borrowed sold one back.

why would something that has a higher value than currently is priced need to go lower first so it can go higher 
that is against all trend following rules and i have no clue why idiots say this in here
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:14:35
Bitcoin is not disruptive, that's blockchain and there is 0 need of bitcoin to let blockchain work in this world, that's why the big guys like Oracle etc are implementing blockchain tech into their products without having any need of Bitcoin at all. 
Bitcoin will be 0,004 cents when things pick up and the Fed makes a dollarcoin, if you think governments and big corpo are going to sit on the side and give away power of currency to a failed bitcoin, then you are delusional. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:08:10
And you are guaranteed of a profit, while bitcoin could be $0,004 overnight when the FED releases a Dollarcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:01:09
sorry english is my 4th language, i will try better

@_date: 2018-06-13 16:07:34
Good news? It just got released that the bull run 2017 BTC was pumped up and fake. 
If this is true what you're saying you need to get rid of your loans right now. You basically got your education for half price. (but it's even more because interests over x years) 
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:50:26
if you think currencies like the dollar aren't global you are delusional
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:52:57
then the big money doesn't have anybody to sell to up high so they are not bullish either
do you have any idea what kind of crap you are saying? 
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:48:07
Yeah, the value of btc is related to how much hype and bs is said about it, if it would be facts it would be trading at $4
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:49:13
I hope it works and turns around for you, good luck

you can always buy in again much lower, i think you made a good move
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:49:05
I think that happened already when it went below 8000
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:02:18
Like so many others
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:05:28
yes and if that happens bitcoin will be at $0,004 overnight. 
if there is really somebody here who thinks governments and big corporations will give away the tool (currency) to control things is delusional.

@_date: 2018-06-24 08:53:44
Yeah sure, it's good for Bitcoin!!
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:46:32
hahaha, wasn't the whole purpose of btc to not have any organisations
you guys just lost it, this is getting hilarious
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:00:48
sorry for your missed profits
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:11:52
Good luck then. Hope it turns out okay. 
Remember to only invest in BTC what you can afford to lose, because there is a very high probability it's going to be worthless when the FED Releases a dollarcoin linked to the $USD
Anybody who thinks that governments and big corpo/banks are going to give away their power of control is delusional. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:51:01
you mean 'to offset the huge losses in a wrong investment like btc'
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:52:45
Financial institutions don't need to show cash in balance sheets with their trading capital, positions are valued and reported they don't need to sell to report that. 
What you say is factually completely wrong. 
First of all, financial institutions trade OTC and this has no impact on the market.
Second of all, financial institutions don't take positions in crypto
please stop posting you know nothing
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:00:15
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:58:38
I'm short BTC because i see these up moves getting faded instantly so I take profit from that. 
That doesn't mean I want you to fail or loose money, you have your idea and strategy and personally I hope you succeed. I'm just on the other side making money instead of losing money. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:35:42

sounds like really what bitcoin was trying to do HA
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:58:16
lol why would a larger exchange make more money with low volume
do you even know how markets work? 
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:06:53
the euro dropped like 30% in 1 year against usd couple of years ago people didn't care what are you talking about
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:06:15
because it isn't a valuable currency
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:07:05
they (FED) already said they are looking to make their own DollarCoin linked to the USD so why would they care about BTC, spoiler alert: They don't.
And when they release their dollarcoin integrated by the biggest IT companies in the world like IBM, Oracle, Microsoft (They are already working on it WITHOUT use of bitcoin) bitcoin will be $0,004 overnight. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:39:52
Gold also shines 
that's pretty cool man, btc doesn't do that
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:52:02
what if it's not
you loose
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:53:35
Yeah it's fine, anyways, I think comparing stock market to crypto is wrong. They are not the same, so why compare an apple to a car? 
The thing with the stock market is, since the crash in 2008 and the flash crash a few years later, markets are not allowed to crash anymore like in the past, as soon as too many sellers come in on the stock market and the price drops too much the markets gets halted 5 minutes, then an hour and if it still doesn't work a day. To only allow bid orders so the price stays up. 
This is why the markets can't crash anymore, and only small corrections can occur and that's why I think we will have a bull market with sideways times that could take a year and corrections of around max 10% in the next 10 years. 
And what I say is already working, we are currently already in the longest bull market ever while bonds drop in price with rising interest rates and still the market isn't crashing. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:58:01
cash out and buy back later when it's lower
if it runs up then you can always enter again
HODL is the most stupid thing you can do, this isnt AAPL, GOOG or MSFT we're talking about here. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:15:34
The minute you have bought BTC is the minute you lost your money. Why would the price recover? Bitcoin has been proven to be technically incapable to replace currency as a payment system. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:16:26
isn't it great you followed rule nr 1, only invest with what you can afford to lose? 
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:05:40
it's sarcastic 
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:52:15

i've been hearing about a bear stock market for 7 years now, it's not going to happen, we will have some pullbacks along the way like we had in 2015 and February so I think the stock equity market bull run can go on for another 10 years with many small corrections along the way. 
you do realize that when you buy shares you can get quarterly dividends and you actually own a part of a company who owns actual things. 
not a phantom hash that is suppose to be going to 'make' it

@_date: 2018-06-27 04:26:08
Dream on. Fed isn't going to compete with BTC they are just going to release an alternative linked to the USD and it's game over with BTC.
You think world cares about BTC? They don't, they care about getting rich fast, lambo here, lambo there, that's all what matters for masses. 
If you think any country or big corpo is going to give away the power of controlling a currency then you are delusional, will never happen.

@_date: 2018-06-29 17:38:25
because the difficulty was like 10 times less
@_date: 2018-06-22 11:54:29
The fact that this is slow means this is 100% full long term bear market with no end in sight
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:04:06
You're right, $0 is strong support. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:02:32
it's not, this is not how markets work, the exchange/broker will step in and if you sell you have to deliver it at a lower price or at a higher price there is your profit loss there is nobody on the other side except the broker who borrows them from somebody who makes them available. 
please don't post anymore you know nothing about how markets work. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:59:43
They said 
"Bitcoin is not dead 'yet' "
But it's dying is my take on it
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:03:18
because pump and dump as proved lately
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:15:40
that is funny
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:53:00
you just summed up this whole subreddit
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:24:07
if that's true what you are writing, then it's pretty bad, nobody is going to step in at lower prices when the miners offloaded their positions 
it will scare any bulls away and give confirmation to the doubters that this is a bad investment
it will keep new buyers away because they will think 'glad i did not step into this' 
it will lambo seekers away because they already thought about buying the last 'dip' buy now or never at 12,10,8,6k and are very happy they didn't
this is not good for bitcoin
i saw friday cnbc calling out 'the funeral of bitcoin' and should we still cover bitcoin in the future with a strong NO

The world needs blockchain, the world does not need bitcoin. 
Oracle, Microsoft etc are implementing blockchain in their databases. 
Again, no bitcoin needed for that. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 00:24:08
plus, blockchain will be integrated in current software products/databases and bitcoin has nothing to do with it, or is needed for it. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:11:08
The world will implement blockchain, no bitcoin needed for that. When things get moving, the FED will release a Dollarcoin and Bitcoin will be $4. 
Max. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:22:33

@_date: 2018-03-30 14:39:39
Could be never, nobody knows, why did it ever run up? Hype, greed to name a few. 
There is no substance behind bitcoin, it's not unique, it's not doing anything unique and you don't need it to implement Blockchain technology. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:29:31
like 99,99% of the institutions aren't even allowed to buy a single bitcoin because of regulations and their terms and conditions
nobody important cares about bitcoin, end of story.

@_date: 2018-03-31 08:42:34
I never understood why it went from $0.01 to $20k
There is 0 reason to have Bitcoin, Oracle and other big players are implementing Blockchain without Bitcoin. 
No government on this planet is going to allow a virtual currency to take over, what are people thinking? 
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:28:25

The problem is when it does not come back, then I will be still in the game trading and you will have blown up and lost everything. 
Make your choice. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:45:38
worldcom too 
@_date: 2018-03-28 07:38:51
Usually it will continue in the trend, meaning DOWN. But in a faster rate as it is now when volume increases. 
Oracle and other big players are making blockchain work with their products without bitcoin at this very moment, that will kill bitcoin completely imho

@_date: 2018-03-18 14:37:18
You imply that they are going to hold or go long and that is not true, because they could be just covering a short position. 
TLDR: You basically know nothing about how markets work
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:06:12
There is a system like that, it's called the monetary system. What you just described brings zero value to the current table. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:50:29
yeah sure, especially when you get in $11.000 and take out 'anywhere in the world' when it's $400
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:35:04
Yeah sure, don't worry about that. 
You can sell your whole position for $0,00004 later on in life. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:04:24
And if it doesn't and stays below $1000 forever? You got a plan for that? 
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:03:58
Absolutely not. 
When the QE started and interests went to zero, countries printed money like crazy, hyperinflation didn't come around. 
You buying gold now, when QE is unwinding and interests are rising is just behind words. 
Good luck, and educate yourself a bit more, please.

I only short Bitcoin this year and it has been golden for me. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:40:24
Yes, because fundamentals won't because it's useless. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:49:38
That is correct. 
I just think that many bitcoin 'investors' focus too much on the tech side of bitcoin, that is pretty useless. The tech side is on blockchain and this is just getting implemented without the use of bitcoin. I hope people realize this. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:03:00
Good luck, you're gonna need it. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:45:45
Where is that? We are much lower than that now. 
Just saying that what you posted doesn't mean anything. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:57:33
Ok that's fair and that's how everybody should have done it.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:54:02

@_date: 2018-11-19 15:24:41
What? The Dollar is at it's highest for decades. 
Please stop reading stupid people's one-liners and look at the facts. 
There was no hyperinflation, gold didn't rally or exploded and the dollar didn't collapse, all the contrary happened. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:14:33
Because the profit margin is too low 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:10:21


That's the moment governments say, no stop, this is illegal. 
End of story. Game over then. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:48:23
Like Oracle and other major players in the industry currently implementing Blockchain in their products without any Bitcoin.
The world does not need Bitcoin to use this tech. Bitcoin is the biggest bubble in the history of mankind.

Wait until Fidelity says they won't make products around bitcoin. That's going to be fun to watch. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:19:25
In trading, you need to have an opinion. 
Do you think it's going up? go long, you think it's going down? Go short. 
The TA to support your vision also has a problem because you will look at it with your biased opinion. 
Yeah, it's all not easy folks ;-)

But that would mean they would have the same attitude as they did before, which in a bear market, compared to a bull market is absolutely not the case. 
That's why technical analysis works splendid if you look in the past, to predict the future, it's a bit of a problem because you see patterns in the making, they don't turn out, so if you look back you will not notice these fake patterns in the making.

Why, I don't understand HODL? If you would just have sold it when it was going down higher, you could just have bought it back lower = less loss = more profit if you're bullish.
HODL makes 0 sense at all, Crypto is in a bear market it's going down down down, if you think now is the time that it is going up, then you need to go see an eye doctor and a shrink too maybe.

Greed is right.
Greed works.
Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.
Greed, in all of its forms -- greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge -- has marked the upward surge of mankind.

$0,04 because the world will work with the dollarcoin issued by the FED
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:46:46
yes and looking at the price, it seems to be correct too. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 04:00:27
Exactly, and the value related to the USD is inverse, so you would need to short the Bitcoin currently to hedge against the dollar. 
It's okay if you can't grasp this intellectually. Just carry on and buy your bottoms in bitcoin and HODL during your losing position forever. All is good and fine.

@_date: 2018-04-05 07:32:05
what if the world uses dollarcoin issued by the FED And btc is $0,003
will you still smile? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:08:19
the promised inflation that was going to happen in the last 10 years didn't happen at all. what you state is not true.
no big money is trying to get into bitcoin, big money is in bonds and equity 
tell me how much gold you want and you will get it delivered
there are so many hedges against inflation, bonds, ... again what you say is incorrect
                                 
                      
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:08:40
BTC has no intrinsic value
@_date: 2018-04-07 05:19:31
You are completely wrong. 
The CME introduced a while ago that every order needs to have a flag if it's manually entered or if the decision to place this order was completely automated. 90% + of the orders are in the latter category. 
So you are completely wrong. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:05:10
You must be crazy rich putting up all these successful short positions.
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:02:15
You are confusing greed with protecting your gains, you are clearly not protecting your gains. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:29:56
okay, have fun. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:01:02
If that would be the case, then the AI would have been programmed in a way that the more people say TO THE MOON the more the bot would SHORT because the more the market would crash!!!
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:12:12
just wait until it's $0 so you don't have to worry about people stealing it !!!
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:18:53
Only losers average losers.
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:13:26
his mom too apparently 
@_date: 2018-12-08 09:44:01
What was the size you moved the market with? 
@_date: 2018-12-04 05:31:43
I get that, and I agree, but that's not how society is organized currently. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:35:07
You are delusional if you have any neurons activating the slightest hint of an idea that countries are going to give power away from controlling a currency. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 08:24:22
Setting up perfectly for another move down to $200
Bitcoin has no reason to be worth more than a few dollars. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:55:50
when it's at $0,004
Probably around 2020
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:23:28
Correct, anybody who thinks countries are going to give up their monetary power to bitcoin is delusional and should be protected against self damage.
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:18:06
It's not cheap, it's still massively overvalued. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 13:46:40
Delusional. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:20:06
nopes, everybody that propped it up last year is gone now, for good. Nobody is going to prop it up now. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 01:46:59
hope you are better in picking your investments
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:58:19
Hahaha, why would there be a motel 6 when you can't pay a room with a bank card. 
do you have any clue about things in life? 
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:21:49
According to your logic, the easier it gets, the more bitcoin price will crash. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 09:42:14
I would rather say $0,004 the moment that with blockchain the Fed introduces a DollarCoin linked to the Dollar. 
Yes, you don't need bitcoin to implement blockchain, something many here seem to forget. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 10:57:44
The loss must hurt. 
Microsoft, Oracle etc are all implementing Blockchain in their database products. ZERO NULL NADA need for Bitcoin with Blockchain. 
If there is going to be a cryptocoin that is going to have any value, it's going to be one released by a Federal Reserve. 
Seems like you are the idiot. Sorry to hurt your feelings snowflake. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:53:54
No, not really, but I had to read all the nonsense people wrote for a year and not it's just a really really good laugh.
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:09:26
I usually hold them for 1 hour to 2 days. 
I exit very fast when I'm wrong on the trade with a minimal loss. 
You need to short in a bear market, not scale into losers as most of the idiots do here. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:33:26
Okay, I hope it turns out well. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 08:37:25
I would just say it's smarter to cut your losses you can always buy lower. 
Averaging down you like you do works until it doesn't, then you lose everything. 
This is not IBM, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN or AAPL we are talking about, this is a hyped up, proven not working payment, hash with no real intrinsic value. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:53:18
Making fun out of you guys. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:26:59
That is correct.
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:02:15
I short every climb in bitcoin. 
I could not be happier seeing so many people losing their shit on not getting lambo as promised. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:26:28
yeah but sports betting on websites is illegal in the USA 
so what's your point here? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 08:00:09
Only losers average losers. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:15:49
Yeah you probably didn't move the market with it -)
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:07:35
zero. 
welcome to bitcoin, the joke of the century
