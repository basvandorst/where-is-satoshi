They likely aren't even using a node to generate wallets/addresses. I'm fairly certain they're using a library for things such as creating and signing transactions and then use the nodes to push the raw transaction and listen for blocks/transactions.
RPC calls are slow and expensive, Coinbase most definitely only uses it for broadcasting transactions, if they even use RPC at all.

The company I work for (did not sign NYA, but are fond of Segwit) are working on implementing Segwit support, but let me tell you from first hand experience that it's not as simple as it may sound.
Just because core supports Segwit doesn't mean that everyonecan change the address creation process to `createSegwitAddress` (pseudocode). The way some systems are designed (like my company's), `bitcoind` isn't actually used for "generating" addresses, it's likely just used for broadcasting transaction and listening for transactions and blocks. External libraries  (just a example) will be used to generate orders, create and sign raw transactions and more. Even though these libraries may support Segwit, the actual code that utilizes these libraries likely require modifications that will take time to develop, test, test again and then finally deploy. That being said, some systems like Bitstamp may only require changing a very small factor, we simply don't know what the specifics is for every company.
And regarding the whole "had time to implement" argument, from our experience and our discussions with other Bitcoin related companies, the whole uncertainty regarding the Segwit situation led us to choose to wait for actual activation before beginning development of a Segwit implementation.
I believe by the end of the year we'll end up seeing most Segwit implementations having been released once more documentation is released for external libraries, company's Segwit implementation has been thoroughly tested and that core has full support for segwit change addresses.

 which was created by BitPay. Doesn't necessarily mean it's a btc1 node though.

I'm 99% sure that the actual user pays the miner fees, not Bitpay or Coinbase.

Maybe the screenshot was taken now? I personally think this is fake based on the balance being a whole number with no decimals being displayed. I just can't believe that the balance would be a whole number with the random amount that is sent/received.

How would it work if it wasn't to confirm? Would the funds be available again in my Blockchain.info wallet? I know that it's dependent on the provider's clearance of the mempool but I haven't found any specific information on how Blockchain would handle this.
