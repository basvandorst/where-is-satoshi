There's always been a fear of early adopter wealth... Nothing new. I was using "destroy" pretty liberally
But a mass selloff would inflict enough panic to cause failure in the sense that the infrastructure melts away based off assumed early adopter wisdom

Lazy troolllll
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:08:49
yes but they're nihilistic... to a fault. If each whale can do it, then are there that many ways to destroy bitcoin?
their defense could be, "if I was able to destroy bitcoin, then so could anyone else, and it wasn't as strong as we believed. Better to fail now then further down the road"

Question.... Do we get bcash if we are holding in private wallets?
And is it too late?
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:33:08
Its a pretty small circle of people. And theyre all on twitter. Theyd have no problem pulling this.off
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:56:39
they need some kind of book to keep track of it all
@_date: 2014-12-29 00:59:08
If you have a lot of something, don't keep it in one place.
That point aside, If you're keeping them in an online wallet, they aren't quite yours. The private key makes them securely yours.

@_date: 2017-03-24 15:18:49
alt coins have been attacked before... the reasoning being that if it's so easily possible, then doing so is a service. its either that or a rogue attacker...

Bitmit does seem to have a temporary bug where the conversion goes haywire. The developer is very friendly and is quick to fix errors.

If you think of the potential price of bitcoin being astronomical, then yes, it would be worth mining any BTC now
@_date: 2012-02-12 05:43:59
I just charged the buyer shipping and then used my own money to ship it, as if I had just kind of bought the bitcoins...
@_date: 2012-02-01 06:22:41
I use this card, and I like it... but the wear from mining is pretty serious 
Also, 795 is ambitious, I wouldn't recommend clocking to get that speed.

I think all episodes should be less than or around four minutes, never to exceed nine minutes.  And I wouldn't put a cell phone on blast, but rather have a nifty speakerphone device with a better speaker.

if you've been here long enough you've seen these same talking points again and again
but on the other hand, the technology is still strong, and scaling better than ever. high fees almost made me not believe, but they implemented lightning and things look very positive for bitcoin

Good question.
I tend to think yes... it was first, and it serves the purpose.

@_date: 2011-07-28 00:24:13

I really don't believe tom williams... I believe that the mybitcoin people were in the irc last night, but I think the 51% is what they settled on after realizing the bitcoin-police were making serious progress...

Even as you deviate from average, you'll find a lot of people on earth using zimbabwe or geoffrey bucks... monopoly money...

@_date: 2011-07-31 19:03:25
I suppose... but Bitcoin is bulletproof because of P2P
@_date: 2011-07-10 16:35:36
It's free for a limited time, how can that be a scam?
@_date: 2011-08-21 04:02:08
I bought some of my first coins from casascius, he's a cool dude.  It's just a matter of time before a much bigger criminal action brings bitcoin into the world spotlight.

I remember this idea for the "poor man's patent..."
Mail the idea and information to yourself in a USPS sealed envelope and don't open it.  If the package hasn't been tampered with, or better yet if there are multiple packages, these would definitely hold *some* weight in court.

This makes sense, it fits into the narrative of a successful bitcoin... just saying
@_date: 2011-10-04 04:42:47
I like the line "...if you understand the implications of this..." kind of melodramatic, but will definitely appeal to the people occupying wallstreet.
