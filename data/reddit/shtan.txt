My cash withdrawal requested on 02 May is still pending and I looking forward if they can settle the issue this coming Wednesday as they promise else I will be best going to report to the Australia local authority, I never face such long withdrawal period from other exchange and this is the worst.

If you are trading in Singapore you can try itbit.com, they have excellent customer support and very good service, withdrawal to my bank took less then 48 hours.

Thanks for the comment , ya I have just started to trading with IGOT and as you describe it was really a bad experience , the support told me that it will took 3-7 working days to show my withdrawal in my bank account but I have withdraw since 31 of October and still not yet received my money , I have ask the support for the status they told me the money was sent from their side should be received in 1 or 2 days times and that was 3 days ago , i haven't get my money yet , they expect people to trading in their platform with such bad service, I agree with you they absolutely suck.

I think should make report to both side Singapore and Australia better, I have all my screen shot as well, you got any direct way to contact the founder RICK Day?

I have SGD1800 at IGOT since 02 may 2015, I think we should launch a report but not sure where to do it because it is australia base company.

Hi ed19 you say they provide you with skype support? Can you provide me the support skype id? I would like to add them and ask about my withdrawal because their support response really suck.

Hi Dan if you plan to use IGOT you have to accept the fact that :
1) They have bad and slow response customer support.
2) Your cash withdrawal will be delay may be half a month or more.
3) You will find yourself periodically creating ticket to chase for payment if you are a active trader.
4) Only way to contact them is through Support Ticket.
5) They are new start-up expanding too fast and the management team do not have enough man power to manage it.

Hello rick good day, finally you show up after all the mess your team have done, is very obvious you guys have fail many people and is not the first time I saw this kind of complaint on this forum and other as well and if you expect people to trust IGOT, you guys might need to be more transparent then what is going on at IGOT now , the main issue :
1) Slow customer support , most of the time it took more then 24 hours or more then 2-3-4 days may be to response to our support ticket and there is only 1 support which is Julie handling all the responses.
2) Slow cash withdrawal and on top of that we still get a fee deduction because your guys use Telegraphic Transfer when we withdraw, but when we deposit using our Singapore or Hong Kong local bank to bank transfer which ever is on your list, IGOT don't get a TT charges which is very unfair.
3) The only way to contact IGOT is only through support ticket and there is no other ways to get to you guys.
Yes we accept your apologies, but how many times do you guys need to fail your customer? 
Your customer Trust and Confidence is at stake, please don't give false hope to your customera again and again!
