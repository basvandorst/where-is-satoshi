What I feel many seem to fail to realize is that crypto is in its infancy. It's new. As someone else I was talking to put it, he compared bitcoin to a blackberry phone.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:34:38
You're right. That was just a regulatory agency. It is just we are currently in a state of instability with bitcoin. Take this as someone who is not currently holding any cryptos, I believe that regulation will be the make it or break it point of bitcoin.

Go to Safari
Go to GDAX.com
Sign in with your Coinbase account
Start using limit orders, and not market

The current values are past the point of value of the technology. Alot of it is speculation. However, the block chain has potential. Imagine you could store all your medical data under one address. A doctor could pull it up or you could under authorization. That's just one example.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:53:13
Switch and use gdax on your phone browser.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:35:52
Yeah I sold on drop down from the 19k at 17.5k. I'll rebuy my coin at a discount soon.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:17:12
Congrats man! A house is a much wiser long term investment than any other investment vehicle for you can ultimately utilize it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:34:16
GDAX is a much better interface than coinbase. You'll have more control atleast.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:32:58
You don't need to turn off the Internet to stiffen the technology of gaming and streaming Netflix.
You just need to pass laws like the recent removal of Net Neutrality.

Thanks for the skrilla and the new word in my vocabulary!
@_date: 2014-12-12 03:22:59
Woah woah, what's a beer? There's measurements of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:00:40
Thank you! It's really fun. Check it out if you can.
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:09:58
Thank you for tipping nr and others :)
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:24:59
I agree with OP. Never looked into bitcoin until today when I was tipped some.
Thanks everyone.
@_date: 2014-12-12 03:49:51
I don't know what a skrilla is but thanks!
@_date: 2017-02-21 14:51:29
Ahhh okay. Thank you for the explanation! I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-12-12 03:23:10
That's how I feel right now!
@_date: 2017-02-21 14:29:15
I thought we are supposed to use it, not hold it.
@_date: 2014-12-16 20:41:44
Hello! I came from and I'm slowing learning more and more about bitcoin. So far it's pretty nifty!
Oh, and my favorite game so far is Titanfall. So many things going on at once!
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:09:58
Hope you're having a good day :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:31:39
Yeah, this sounds like a good idea. /s
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:18:12
While this is true, I doubt I can learn the stuff I want to learn by myself. I need a formal education for that.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:02:10
Investment alternative until volatility stop.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:00:33
It's a challenge for me, especially on this subreddit. I want to learn more about it, but i feel so many people on here can not give me a reasonable or conclusive answer.
It's hodl, buy the dip, and to the moon. My fear is that if the government or a banking system can implement the technology of the block chain to their current currency system, then bitcoin will be fail.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:48:21
As much as I love bitcoin, I agree. Bitcoin to me, and I feel many newcomers, is not a currency but an investment alternative.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:34:52
Apologize. I just avoided Twitter after it being a shit storm for so long. I have seen some recent trend upward lately.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:14:26
Yeah, I am really struggling on this. I don't see bitcoin as a currency anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:35:24
True. It's just so much smarter to invest elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:29:51
He has a point. Twitter, Groupon, and Snap all did not perform well in the stock market. At least, now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:13:10
In education? Yeah, I currently have a bachelor's, but I do want my masters soon.
In terms of learning by myself, it's hard. A lot of what I want to learn is technical such as improving my skills in signal processing or understanding electric motor and electronic magnetics better.
On the other hand, I am wanting to start a side business, which I am capable of learning myself.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:26:33
By all means, you're correct. I have made a serious attempt at self learning. Hell, that's exactly what my job forces me to do. However, I have rather quickly reached a point where I have no choice but to seek higher levels of education.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:09:45
I'm not sure how to feel about this. Would this not disrupt bitcoin elsewhere?
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:02:17
Pump and dump man.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:34:59
Thanks for the help man!
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:20:26
Not bad!
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:11:47
There's so fucking many. I got a job offer to develop a crypto currency for a start up company recently. Fuck that.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:24:26
I really don't. I just would prefer it, so I don't have to worry about it.
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:39:09
Question, what is the purpose of an altcoin if bitcoin exists? Would that not just create confusion?
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:18:43
Awesome, looks like I'll be buying half later today.
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:03:11
Sweet bot!
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:27:06
Then what is the basis of your analysis and predictions? Fundamental or technical?
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:01:28
Why do you think so?
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:37:02
I honestly do not have experience with creating a crypto currency. With that said, I am quite young still and would rather spend my time honing my skills elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:50:16
That's what I'm thinking. What makes bitcoin valuable is the technology and the fact it was one of firsts. There is a lot of use with the blockchain for the average banker.
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:53:39
Would you then derive the reason behind your numbers? If you are so confident in sharing the results on your research, then I see no reason you shouldn't be shy in sharing some tidbits on your analysis.
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:29:00
Thank you for a legitimate answer.
However, for the longevity of crypto, how would these still hold place? Would litecoin replace bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:27:59
To me, I see it as if the US had another currency that would be used along with the dollar.
They are all under the same roof, right?
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:49:13
How do you go about storing them? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:54:22
Thank you for giving to those in the community who need it and can use it.
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:21:08
I got 5 dollars one time. Best day ever.
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:48:35
So the best time to actually jump in is now? Speaking as somehow who has had interest in over a year, but I just now got a decent paying job that I can afford to buy 1 coin.
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:38:09
Got it, now I just need to do it.
