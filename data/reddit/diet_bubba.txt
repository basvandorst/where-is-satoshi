I thought GPU mining was the lower side of mining.

I mine with my dad and he's a programmer, we mine LTC with the L3+ right now and the profitability calculators said the L3+ makes 3$ a day but we made a pool hash rate optimizer which takes pools and switches between the one with the best hash rate. When we took the miner and programed it to do this we made 10$  a day.

Just trust meh bro. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:05:19
What is the most profitable miner for under 2000$
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:00:51
Lol, ok
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:36:26
Oh, ok.
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:09:45
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:00:05
What if I optimize the miner to switch between pools?
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:34:41
The other guy said about 6$
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:06:08
How much?

What's the best miner for under 2000$
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:01:15
Well I optimized ltc not btc.

You get paid from multiple pools in the end.
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:12:41
What if I ad optimizing bots to find the best pool to mine? Like prohashing but with pools. Because that quadrupled my earnings with the L3+ when I mined Litecoin
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:49:27
(Programming involved) you take 4 bots and have them mine 4 pools at once, they will find the pool with the best hashing power and put all the hashing power into that pool. Along with the highest pool mining 504 MHS in your case, it also takes the money from the pools that were mined before. This gains you about 10 more cents per hour. You multiply that by 4 because you have 4 cores and 4 pools running and get around 10$ ��
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:32:22
What about with pool optimization?
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:27:56
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:31:04
It also has money in the pools it mined before.
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:15:22
And do you know what pool optimization with progamed bots is?
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:37:24
What?
