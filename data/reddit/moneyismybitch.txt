Coinbase is in San Francisco and are being scrutinized by the sec and the IRS, as well as the numerous customers (aka lawyers). They tried that shit with the last bitcoin hard fork and quickly got sued in court and changed their stance in giving out our bitcoin cash. They aren't going anywhere, and if they tried, they would be found out very quickly and even more quickly find out the taste of cheesey bbc.

For every real contract of gold you get about 1000 buy/sell with no gold changing hands. It's just paper/digits that the big institutions use to control the price with and they can easily control the price Since they have unlimited paper/digits. Same thing will happen to bitcoin with futures. 
What they big institutions will try to do is short the price lower.if they can't they will try to pump and dump causing more volatility. Look at gold when it hit almost 2000 to now.
