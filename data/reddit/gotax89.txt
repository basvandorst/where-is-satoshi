The difference is the tech bubble produced something, an actual product with actual real world application that are being use by billions of people, crypto is nothing but get rich quick sceme. You all need to remember that blockchain ico don't get audited and don't show you how they spend their money. Where tech stocks did. Hence why you saw an increase throughout the years. People could see apple profits and their products. They saw new technology entering the market and  overall people wanted to buy a share in the company. They don't buy useless coins with no legal obligation. When you buy crypto you buy the hope for a hype and someone buys it off you for 10x the price. Just wait when they all become securitys and you see how much money they are spending on useless shit, and watch your coins go down the toilet.

Anyone can write a whitepaper, anyone come come up with an idea. What i am saying is, there is no obligation for any ico to provide the following. They don't need to be third party audited, they don't offer you any rights or holdings of their company, they are not regulated whats so ever. They are bypassing so many obstacles that are critical for any company to raise capital. You buy a coin that has nothing to do with the company. If Microsoft wanted to buy one the companies like iota, Microsoft can say cool they have no share holdings so no need to buyout during the acquisition. I have seen so many people pure so much of their money into this, thinking its something revolutionary financial opportunity. Blockchain technology has merits but its not worth the hype its on.
