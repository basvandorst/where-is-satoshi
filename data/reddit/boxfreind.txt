I was talking to my banker at Chase (I've got a business debit account) about this and he said several of his clients have complained about Coinbase straight up making unauthorized withdrawals from their bank accounts that weren't linked to any actual transactions!

And what do Bytes have to do with it?

I have never been charged that much for sending BTC to someone before. And again, if this IS the case, paying for stuff with BTC is just stupid and it's only a matter of time before the whole thing collapses. Would YOU but something for twice the cost of the product?

Are you kidding me??? NO! If that were the case, then BTC would just be dead weight. No one is going to buy stuff on Newegg with BTC if they have to pay $30 in addition to the cost of the purchase!
Maybe I should have been clearer, they put that fee onto a purchase I made on Newegg. What was even more sketchy was that the transaction originally showed as $25 and then when I looked at it later, it had magically changed to $55! I had to dig through the transaction to find the fee, just from the entry on Coinbase, it looked as if the transaction had changed to $55.

I disagree. There was a time when journalism had integrity. But the Cold War and the military industrial complex shot that all to hell.

There is a lot of that.

There is a lot of truth there. The "news" isn't really news anymore, it's "buy this, be scared of this, etc, etc"
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:25:38
Definitely not. Like I said above, fantasy world. The real world is fucked.

I even saw a headline this morning on the Google Now page on my phone claiming that BTC had fallen to $2,000. I didn't click on it and I can't find that article now. I can see that Bitcoin CASH was/is around $2,000. I can't help but think that these types of "errors" are intentional.

The difference between Republican conspiracies is they usually have to do with Obama or the Jews.

It's not paranoid to talk about possibilities. And if you think the 1% is some sort of myth then you're living in a fantasy world. "The wealthiest 10% of all Americans own 81% of all shares of stock owned by U.S. households. The wealthiest 1% of all Americans own 35% of all the stock owned by U.S. households. 53% of Americans — or just over half the population — do not own any stock at all." That was in 2010. You can only bet that it's gotten worse since then, and will continue to worsen under Trump's new "tax plan".

But this is a picture and the daily discussion thread is only comments. I cannot post a picture in comments. Maybe consider allowing this post or consider disallowing picture posts?

Lol when I first mentioned I was building a mining rig and was gonna start mining Bitcoin or maybe some other cryptocoin to my buddy last year, he hadn't even heard of BTC yet and as I described it to him over the phone he was so fucking confused lol. He was picturing me in his head building some sort of drilling rig and heading into the mountains to dig up these coins or maybe metal that I would use to mint coins. The next day we went to a hockey game and when it came up in conversation I realized the miscommunication and explained the whole thing to him in detail.... Well I explained it after I finished laughing uncontrollably for a couple of minutes. Not that he's stupid or that I was laughing AT him, it was just so fucking hilarious ��.

This is super late, but I thought I'd share that after a little under a month and a half, I DID finally get authorized, and I would also like to say that Gemini is AWESOME. WAY better that Coinbase. Fees are a fraction of what those fraudsters at Coinbase charge, plus they are very transparent about how everything works and what they do to ensure the security of your BTC. They even let you spend BTC you don't have yet while it's being processed (usually takes 5-7 days, i think this might be mandated by law).

If Morgan Freeman ever actually reads this on public television, i would watch it.

I had to wait a month and a half to get verified. They were extremely backlogged at the beginning of the year. Im not sure about now, but it wouldn't surprise me at all.

I even heard from my Chase banker that some of his clients said Coinbase just straight up made unauthorized withdrawals out of their linked bank accounts!

I hate Coinbase. I was with them for just under a year before switching to Gemini and by that time i had lost all trust in them. They are skeevy as fuck, their customer support never answers any support requests or emails, the BTC ticker on their site is fixed to try and "spook" people into rushed buys and sells during periods of high market volatility, their fees are outrageous, and they will even blatantly steal from you. I had $30 in BTC mysteriously vanish as an additional "processing fee" about an hour after the transaction in question went through, a purchase of a $25 subscription to a file sharing site. That's some "fee". Fuck Coinbase.

I use Gemini and im pretty sure they do Etherium and Bitcoin but not Bitcoin Cash. They are crazy good, fees are tiny compared to Coinbase.
