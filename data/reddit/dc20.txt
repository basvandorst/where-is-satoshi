If Karpeles was a true Japanese MAN he would have been an hero weeks ago.

Did the 750K BTC just disappear in 1 single transaction or was it from several different wallets (one for each user)?   The way it sounds all funds were in Gox controlled wallets so "investors money"  is hard to establish because at that point it's all under control of the company.   All payouts were from other investors money in that case.


What did users account statements/balances show up till withdraws were halted?  The BTC was gone prior to halting withdraws yet users still saw they had money in their accounts but could not withdraw it.  That seems like a falsified statement would you not agree?


If the first point is that the money disappeared all at once how long did operations continue after that fact was known.  Was the money stolen shortly before withdraws were halted or months prior?

Leak?  As in data, keys?  Or leak as in time syncing?

If krapples was taking coins and moving them out of the business or funneling the money elsewhere that's a ponzi.  
The balance on your account at mtgox shows 100BTC but that's just a number on the computer and there really isn't 100BTC in the wallet.  
That's a ponzi.

Depending on the browser is it possible some of the sites have the passwords saved?  Or if you click on the username box once does a list of usernames appear?  
Perhaps, the usernames and passwords are saved?

Actually one of the addresses is posted in BTC source code from 2011.  So...there's that.

If the robbers are the owners of the business it's a ponzi scheme.

What does a creditor do?  They are choosing to extend credit to an institution so that that group may utilize it as they see fit to generate a profit.   To a bank the creditors are liabilities and their loans are assets.  You may not feel like an investor when you choose to put your money on deposit with an institution but that's the reality of the relationship.  
You can willingly choose to ignore reality but you can not ignore the consequences of ignoring reality.

Technically when you deposit money into an institution you're an unsecured creditor to that institution.  If the fact that Mtgox is saying that bothers you what do you think your local banker calls your savings account, 401K, IRA, and stock portfolio?

Every fear you just expressed could substitute bitcoin and replace with US dollar and be scaled up to a much larger scale than anything bitcoin has up to now accomplished.

Ok keep that upbeat positive attitude.  Either way I agree it's a clusterfuck.

I believe the sarcasm was lost in my comment but absolutely these companies are "scams".  They may send product but the delays are factored into the model.
