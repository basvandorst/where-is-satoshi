is that how you think it really works? or were you trying to be witty?

at the risk of being censored, some interesting observations to point out.
the more vocal/infamous "core" developers received a huge amount of funding. They created a BIP (dont want to trigger auto moderation so i wont mention it but we all know what it is), and it seems anyone NOT in favor of their solution gets attacked. 
the hillarious/sad part is the hypocrisy. One side claims the other is being "hostile" and trying to "take over" Bitcoin. If a majority (keyword MAJORITY) of people  voluntarily decide the OTHER open source fork is the way to go, that is somehow a "51% attack". Again for emphasis , MAJORITY.  
Maybe I'm crazy, but that seems pretty far fetched for there NOT to be any shilling going on in here, especially when we know there's millions of dollars of funding and these marketing/shilling companies don't cost that much.

a bit disingenuous considering that BU is a fork of CORE. Meaning more than 90% of the code is identical....
also lets say your claims are valid. What makes you think these issues are not fixable through software updates?

hah, you assumed I'm for BU. typical.
Go ahead and attack my character. Attack Gavin and Jeff Garzik too, it's shown to be effective. But you talk of real experts and I am parroting what Garzik said about segwit. 
You know, one of the guys who provided ACTUAL value to the protocol, unlike certain usurpers.
Anyways, I feel my post was rational and I have definitely done a lot of research on segwit to come to my conclusion. your post did not persuade me. Segwit is still not the answer to the pressing issues of mempool backlog and fees. Too little, too late. I am not interested in second layer solutions at this time. Malleability shouldn't get priority over the real issues at hand. 
Your attempts at labeling me is **rejected**! I've read what both sides have to say on Segwit. The specs, the claims, and the reality. how does that make me ignorant?

oh boy, 
flame suit on.
The purpose of segwit is to allow for side/off-chain transactions. That in itself is not wrong or evil, but I don't like being told it's the ONLY answer and that disagreeing makes you an enemy. 
As for the technical aspects, the "blocksize" increase (it's not a true blocksize), assumes that everyone is on a Segwit node. So at best, you get a hacky 2mb which will require MONTHS to activate and requires a vast majority of people to be on segwit nodes. Not to mention it FUNDAMENTALLY changes the structure of bitcoin blocks forever (unnecessary complexity).
Segwit is a Lightning Network malleability fix that accidentally had the potential to cram a few more transactions (by moving data out of the blocks). 
So why are some people against this? 
Because it's not the answer to the REAL problems like mempool backlog and inflated fees. It's being labeled as a blocksize increase but that was not what segwit was designed for, it's just marketed as such.

I would argue Xstream has Millions of incentives ($) to have their implementations merged in and retain power (repo access) to Bitcoin..

assuming this isn't a shitpost and you are looking for actual information.

did Jihan also post this on the bitcoin mailing list or was it Joseph Poon?
Bitmain is providing evidence, you're just angrily talking shit...

actually, someone can not be in support of segwit and it has nothing to do with the alleged asicboost exploit (which was only recently discovered).
