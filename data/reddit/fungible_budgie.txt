Yeah that seems to be the most likely answer, but im not sure how that information aids in the solving of the puzzle. All the other clues are directly related to the picture itself. 
i put 00 21 21 21 into google maps and it points to a place in Africa, right on the equator. Starting to feel like im chasing my own tail with the puzzle.

Ok. I've got something. The little "X" in the box is the key. Copy the "X" and move it around the picture. Some clue words match exactly one way and the others match the opposite. Maybe thats the pairs. You want both sides of the box. Both angles. My eyes hurt.

Ok I just tested that site with a valid (empty) seed. It went through the combos and said no valid phrase found. I'm assuming it wont work with an empty address because for it to be "valid" it needs to have had some activity on the wallet.
Are you 100% sure you had bitcoin attached to that wallet?
@_date: 2018-05-27 06:59:05
For those that want to take a quick break on this puzzle, I've created a slightly easier puzzle. I've hidden some bitcoin and to access it decipher the cryptic message below:
    KztzmEtC   oyMapqyi7kpqPeZbEmvb2   ebd1dQXH   gD3EqC   WH35dkVau
**Hint:** It's a private key
**Hint  Space is the only thing that separates you from over 100,00 satoshis
**Hint  If it was any easier I'd be copying and pasting it into your wallet for you
**It's been found! I can't believe it lasted 18 minutes but it did. Congrats to the winner**
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:19:28
meant the winning mnemonic. I would laugh if the winning mnemonic is only 3 words though because most of us are only trying 12/24.

Any thoughts on the random big "k" between 'transaction' and 'timestamp'?
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:08:49
When you look at the funding of the prize address you come across [this]( transaction. 0.00212121 BTC sent to that other address. The plot, as they say, thickens..
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:04:27
Thinking out loud again......
Newest clue is "-1". OP refers to it [here]( as "one less step". And again [here]( Thinking in pairs. **Less/More**. Less is not bip39. More is.
Try +1 = "try one more".
**try** **one** **more** is itself a valid 3 word mnemonic.... I'm never going to win this, am I?

*Bitcoin Circa 2011*
A bitcoin address looked like this:
    1GA9nmnyiKnDGm3WPY29Quk83AvYx92sZH
A bitcoin **private key** looked like this:
    
    5KDFz1Jjorfu54RHgfFKJaUgSnCAP8wDcRDc4GMV7XTXfTHAyd6
A mnemonic seed looked like this:
    humble shuffle close allow home melt predict grace category office bleak good
A *brainwallet* was a dumb way of generating a bitcoin address and private key pair from any string of a users choosing, much like a password. A famous one looked like this:
    correct horse staple battery
Blockchain.info was a popular online wallet. There was a few websites for creating paper wallets, I think Bitaddress.org was one? Multibit was a popular software wallet, Electrum may have been around then too.
Thats all the history I can think of off the top of my head. The certificate you printed out, does that have any clues as to what site you got it from?
@_date: 2018-05-25 11:36:04
yeah its a long shot but i've got nothing else right now. 00212121 is a weird clue because its not anywhere in the picture and that 0.00212121btc transaction could just be for pointing to the consolation prize address to let you know if you're on the right track. 
If it's supposed to be possible to solve this just from the greeting card itself I don't know how anyone would arrive at 00212121.
@_date: 2018-05-27 06:06:19
no tienes idea / you have no idea
@_date: 2018-05-27 22:17:18
It hasn't been claimed. I can't find it in your comments though.
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:26:51
This is so frustrating. The only things that could have possibly changed is the derivation path OR the removal of a passphrase. 
The new clue is "-1" but we don't know which clue we have to "-1". Is "Try +1 now Try -1?". Help me obi-wan-kenobi you're my only hope.
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:11:44
yes the Binomial Random Walk theory is interesting and the puzzle could be about the two chains - "honest" &amp; "attacker", but i have no idea how to translate that into a valid seed.
@_date: 2018-05-23 07:34:23
what pair did you get from 00212121?
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:34:48
If you're sure you have your 11 words written down in the correct order and are just missing one word off the end, it wouldn't be too hard to brute force. You'd just be missing the checksum.
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:49:31
Well, we know about derivation paths and this puzzle is hard because there is a 1 btc prize!

I'd hate to be trying to solve this looking at a greeting card. The file just seems too large and high res to not have something hidden in it. Guess we'll know when it finally gets solved. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:17:29
i can see how you got the "2 ∞" (to infinity) - but the &amp; beyond? are you saying " &lt; " is beyond? wouldn't that be "less than".

The angles of the words match either this angle \ , or this angle / - that is as far as I've got with that theory.
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:14:33
It was over 100,000 satoshis.
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:14:34
Thats probably it. Except the OP keeps using "less" with -1. He could have said minus one step, but he seems deliberate with the word less. I've been staring at this puzzle for so long I could be overthinking it.
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:25:42
Excellent point! X marks the spot on 257 so it's possible the derivation does not start at 0.
@_date: 2018-05-25 08:55:44
1 BTC = 1 BTC. Good enough for me.
@_date: 2018-05-24 08:10:35
Oh no the dreaded 3! Whatever will we do? But seriously it's not a multi-sig address. Just use ian colemans tool and select bip49 for derivation path. m/49'/0'/0'/0
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:50:35
Some of the clue words are all at the exact same angle, e.g "code", "easily", "lost", "almost", "users", "try", "+1" etc. Others are perfectly horizontal. I've been trying to find a pattern in like if a certain angle touches a bip39 word etc. Can't find any pattern that matches all the way through though.
@_date: 2018-05-26 11:39:10
There is more than 10 seed words within the white circle. The mnemonic likely needs 12 minimum. If you go 0-9 you have ten anyway.
@_date: 2018-05-25 11:26:07
not yet. i'm currently off on another tangent with 00212121. going through all previous mnemonics with the derivation path set to m/49'/0'/0'/212121...no luck so far.

If you are on the right track you should have found the consolation prizes. Did you check those addresses?
@_date: 2018-05-21 12:55:25
Download [this]( Open the index.html with your browser. Select Bip49 as derivation path.  Or use the online version [here](
@_date: 2018-05-25 10:37:13
If you can derive a private key or mnemonic from the numbers and words within the logo then, yes, it could be that simple.
@_date: 2018-05-25 04:12:29


Thats what im thinking too, except "open" from the "almost open" clue is in the wrong half. Its the only clue word on the other side.
@_date: 2018-05-21 05:25:46
**Theory 
This clue: *00212121* is the first **8** words. Using the other clues the valid seed would look like this:
word0+word0+word2+word1+word2+word1+word2+word1+**try**+ word1 +**almost** + **open**
We just need to correctly identify word0, word1 &amp; word2.  "Think in pairs". Valid mnemonics can contain words doubled up as in this example below:
**early early attack try attack try try attack almost try try open**
I now think the correct answer is in fact only 12 words. Wish me luck.
@_date: 2018-05-27 07:55:41
Solution was copy the string, remove spaces. It was a private key with spaces in it.

@_date: 2018-05-27 01:39:03
I thought of another scenario that might have happened. Seeds can contain the same word twice etc, so is it possible when you were writing down your seed you saw a word that you had already written down and thinking it was an error didn't write it down the second time?
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:44:26
Any idea which clue is related to the passphrase?
@_date: 2018-05-21 09:17:08


mentioned consolation prizes. Nobody has found anything. That says to me that nobody has gotten close to being on the right track. Son, I am disappoint.
@_date: 2018-05-21 06:03:24
The final two clues were: Try +1 and Almost Open. So try is 9th word, +1 is tenth, Almost 11th &amp; Open 12th.
edit: i guess another way to look at it is, Try +1 could mean try and then try again? try try.
@_date: 2018-05-23 07:28:49
No they didn't.
@_date: 2018-05-27 05:14:14
i found your seed but theres nothing left in it. I checked the first change couple of change addresses and they've been emptied too. Did someone else get it?
edit: nevermind i found it. Thanks!
edit edit: the missing word was **market** if anyone was interested
@_date: 2018-05-25 08:32:08
There is transaction AND transactions. "Lost transaction costs almost users" is most likely referring to the horizontal "transaction" that goes into the bitcoin logo. Does it matter? I wish i knew :(
@_date: 2018-05-27 07:55:32
Solution was copy the string, remove spaces. It was a private key with spaces in it.

@_date: 2018-05-24 22:49:40


Except that said [here]( that -1 was a clue, not a downvote. That throws out your theory of +1 just being a "thumbs up". Your other "clues" are equally useless. Stick to trying to solve the puzzle and stop asking for hand outs (thats directed to everyone posting their btc address).
@_date: 2018-05-26 11:51:36
I know, right?! Now, I've figured out the puzzle the answer is "bit coin". Who do I email to claim my prize?
@_date: 2018-05-25 04:40:44
I'd assume in the order in which they were given. Except the infinity and beyond clue is not an "official" clue, posted and deleted it quickly and has never acknowledged it.
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:34:53
Correct. So if was on the right track he should have hit at least one of the consolation prize addresses.
@_date: 2018-05-28 05:22:05
Thats why I missed it, I was looking for words formatted with code tag
    
    like this
Still, I'm surprised nobody picked up on those words in that thread. I'll drop the private key in another thread and see how quick it gets snatched.
