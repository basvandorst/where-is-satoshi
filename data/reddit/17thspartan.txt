My experience with bitcoin has always been 
2011: "I'm not investing in such a volitile currency that won't be around for a year" 
2012: "Eh, my attempt at CPU based mining didn't net me much, just a quarter of a bitcoin. I'll stop since electricity costs me more than this is worth" 
2016: "I fucked up and I dont know where my ancient mining wallet or passwords are". 
2017: "Eh, I'll invest when the prices stop going up."
Now I'm at the point where I'm wondering if I should dive head in and add more to my collection or if I should expect a crash any time soon.

On desktop, Electrum will say you don't have enough funds if you adjust the fee after typing in how much you want to send. 
I adjust the little 'fee' slider bar, then put in how much I want to send and it works out fine. I dunno if it's the same for Android, but it might be a similar issue, since funds clearly isn't the problem.

You mean you don't mint your bitcoins into actual coins so they can be spent? 
I'm starting to think I'm doing this all wrong.

Yea, that toaster doesn't look like it's open source at all.

Well, I'm glad to hear it's not just me/coinbase. I've been waiting over an hour and a half for Coinbase to give me a link to my transaction so I can monitor it. Usually an hour is enough time for me to get all the confirmations I need.

Trezor is pretty decent and easy to use. The password manager and U2F are a nice bonus as well (although I think other hardware wallets can do U2F as well). 
[I wouldn't worry much about the recent blogpost]( by the alleged hacker who found a weakness in Trezor's system (it was a legit weakness, but Trezor put out fixed firmware). If their hack was even remotely successful today, they wouldn't be asking for 20BTC on the clearweb to sell the tools to someone. Like every other serious actor, they would have sold it discretely via any number of tor markets, without making a big post about it. When you're selling tools to exploit something, the most idiotic thing you can do is let the company know there's a problem they need to fix by making a public blogpost about it.
At this point, the only reason they made a blog post about this, is because they know what they sell won't work, so instead they're making a post on the clearweb to get as much visibility as possible, increasing their chance of getting some sucker to pay 20BTC for nothing useful.

Yea, I bought some earlier in the year, but I didn't get much because it was sorta stable and I wasn't sure if it would go down or up. Anyways, I'm waiting for it to come down and I'll get some.

The Nano S, and Trezor, give you a set of words to write down (the 'seed'). You can use the seed to recover your wallet (onto a new device, if you buy a new one) or recover your bitcoins.  
Edit: You can use a passphrase to further encrypt your wallets, so I think to recover it on a Trezor, you need to use your passphrase as well (if you set that up).

Yea, I'm definitely waiting for that. I expected it to happen when it hit 2.8-3k,but then it skyrocketted to 4k much faster than I thought it would have. 
Anyways I'm going to buy a bunch when it comes down.

That would be interesting, but such volitility would hurt its adoption I think (which would be the key to long term growth, which I'm counting on). 
Anyways I'll be buying as soon as it comes down in price.

Certainly could be. I'm out of my depth when it comes to the software development side of things.

Wait for Trezor 2, or use Nano S. Trezor (original) is good, but I don't know how easy it is for them add currencies to it, but Trezor 2 is being made from the ground up to be easy to update and such. 
Ledger Nano S on the other hand, seems to be ok with adding new currencies to their wallet.

Most of my knowledge of bitcoin comes from this game: 
Where I've learned that your ability to get rich on bitcoin is directly proportional to how fast you can tap the screen. I'd consider that game, and this guy to be equally informative.
