My dad wasn’t a billionaire. And I haven’t filed for bankruptcy 4 times.

Yeah who asks an open question and then mocks an answer
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:05:49
He’s not but whoever wrote this for him might be because he sure as shit didn’t write this himself
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:05:51
His dad was a billionaire and he’s filed for bankruptcy 4 times. It’s ironic, you moron
@_date: 2015-05-01 01:25:15
wow that graph is not to scale at all
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:48:34
You're stupid
@_date: 2019-02-25 23:02:16
Oh logarithmic scale. I thought btc was a lot closer to overtaking Visa than it actually is.

I don’t think he would pump and dump. I think he’d just pump and become a billionaire in two currencies. Maybe the first fiat AND crypto billionaire?
@_date: 2019-02-25 23:09:06
Understood, just read the graph wrong at first.

I personally figured that his recent statements followed from a sizable holding of bitcoin.  I'm happy to hear he is praising bitcoin purely from an admiration viewpoint rather than potentially manipulating the market for his own gain.
Not that I would be disappointed if he did indeed have a large holding and was hoping to give the market a boost...

Agreed. No reason to do it either since the whole point was that it passed PayPal. Only reason I see to use log scale was to mislead. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 00:24:11
Yeah I understand why a log scale is used generally
@_date: 2019-09-18 03:11:01
Or $376 per taxpayer

Hey you are a very cool person. I wish all of whichever gender you prefer to fall madly in love with you.

I'm 22000 in the queue... Will I ever be able to trade from Dwolla?
