You cannot pretend that just because Bitcoins are technically a currency, they are not treated like a commodity from an investment standpoint.

Can you at least admit that, for the moment, bitcoins are behaving more like a commodity than a currency? 
It's not smart to put the majority of your net worth in something which behaves like a commodity, is it not? It is extremely risky. Sure, maybe 10 years down the road the value of bitcoin stabilizes and becomes an accepted currency, but for the moment that is not the case.

Could you please clarify? I used to play high volume online poker, and the day the US government seized the domains of all of the major online poker websites was the day that online poker, as well as my income, ceased to exist.

What is it about peer to peer btc transactions that makes them safe from the government? Say the government really didn't like btc, could they also seize websites that distribute the software capable of holding and transferring bitcoins?
I'm very interested in how robust this system is.

Keep most of your net worth in bitcoins?????? This post actually got an upvote?
I'm pretty sure it's bad to keep most of your net worth in ANY one single investment.

I understand the concept, my post was more of a rhetorical question.
