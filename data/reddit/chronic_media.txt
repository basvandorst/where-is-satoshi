Have to trade Bitcoin to obtain Monero.. Also that won't stop Exchanges that you connect to directly from slapping your acc info to your IP Address :P
They won't know what you did with your Monero but they'll know of your interests, how much you spend (Monthly, Bi)weekly, etc.

That's how Bitcoin has become a store of value like Gold, nobody wants to move their coins :P
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:42:13
Well ETH is not a store of value nor is it mean't to be used as an a currency.

Well Coinbase is slow on by itself but yeah i see where you're digging. Best to buy Ethereum if you want speed. But if you're holding Bitcoin for value.. Then you'll have to deal woth that unfortunately :P

@_date: 2017-10-06 11:03:08

Well when you're down on youe luck it would cost you more in fees to sells &amp; exchange to your currency so it's best to just do a cheap transaction to another wallet as a means of getting rid of it for something you want or just hodl.

[This is awesome]( I've never heard of it and this is good for adoption.
Have you tried donating back to them in anyway?
@_date: 2019-09-26 21:23:28
Holy shit that sounds amazing.
I'm fine with capital gains on exchanging to said FIAT, but crytpo-crypto trades should not be taxable because what good it is as currency?
I'm certain they're doing this as a means of keeping CryptoCurrency down but we can only hope that things change.

You "had" to split Bitcoins with your Ex?
