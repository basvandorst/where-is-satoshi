Ok, thanks for clearing that out for me

Yea i know, i was asking about few machines per ip cause im making a cointerra farm.
Thanks for the info.

Well, it sounds like a very profitable deal for rich people/banks, why arent they mining it all out?

You are talking about custom made machines or like cointerra and stuff like that?

Badly designed in what term, ive been looking to talk with someone who ones a terraminer.
Mining little less than stated wont be a problem for me and as for using it.

1 terraminer iv should get me even in 4-5 month so im okay with that(calculated the next difficulty)

So, this machine can only mine the sha256 compatible hashes?

Okay i got it, but that still means that when im mining with a decent power of more that 1th/s i can get a normal bitcoin count and complete my initial investment by3-5 month and just get more hardware and grow from that.

I dont remember asking if its waste of money.
@_date: 2014-06-19 03:28:42
Even making 2 bitcoins per month is more than enough for me, so i dont have problems with that.

Not cool, they are taking over.
This wont end well...
