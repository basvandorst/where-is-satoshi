You are most welcome.

I thought this was awesome, so I showed it to my wife and her response was "What happens to the bitcoins when they fall off the table?". It's pretty, but as a tool to explain/understand Bitcoin, it needs work.

I've done it ~5 times and no problems so far. Would recommend.

Installed at 9am. Will report time to full sync on a cable modem.

May I ask why you wouldn't recommend them as a wallet?

I don't see any reason that bitcoin cannot continue to evolve through future releases. It does not have to remain static.

Synced just fine. Took 23hours.

I only got 2 bites. Oh well.

I totally just made this offer to my friends as well!

Coinbase allows you to schedule a weekly buy. That would essentially do what you are asking.
@_date: 2015-01-24 18:37:32
I second that. This is an interesting case.
@_date: 2016-03-21 23:24:34
Well they said in their road map that was the plan... so i'm not sure what your point is.

I suspect they are understaffed. I think the support I have gotten from them has been excellent, but it took forever to get the problem solved. Probably a backlog.

Thrilled to see a reasoned, well thought out post on @_date: 2018-02-21 00:46:10
Did you catch at the end of the article when they revealed that his fund made less than half the return of the S&amp;P last year? Hilarious.

Docker is not compatible with the DS213j unless I'm missing something.

So, basically, bitcoin core on ARMv7 is a no go and I should stop wasting my time. Here's the specs on all the synology systems if anyone wants to look.

2mb in 18 months? This is becoming ridiculous.

I just got a store for my wife's art up the other day. It only has one item so far, cause I'm waiting on photos, but it's  I also registered  manually on blockstack, but I'm having a few problems getting it to point at the right store.
