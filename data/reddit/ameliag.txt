When I planned adding the Bitcoin option, they were like $45, so it was actually a super discount deal. I don't want to use Bitcoin as a dollar proxy. I think it is important to actually do business in Bitcoin, but it looks like I'll have to figure out how to address the volatility. I remember when my mother was stationed in Brazil, the inflation was so crazy that people couldn't get the same amount of groceries if they cashed their paychecks on Monday instead of Friday.

Why would I want to say I tried, but there was no demand? When we planned adding the Bitcoin option, they were like $45, so it was actually a super discount deal. I don't want to use Bitcoin as a dollar proxy. For folks who don't mind getting a bonus via snail mail, the change is why the free T-shirts were added.

Thousands of people have purchased Blue Blood T-shirts over the years, so, while I personally think the anonymous aspect is just really cool technology, yes, a lot of people do want a BlueBlood.com T-shirt.

Went ahead and lowered the price to half a Bitcoin because it was just getting too super high in dollars. I'm a little uncomfortable doing this because I really do believe that items must be priced in a currency for that currency to stabilize into its own independent mode of trade and not be just a proxy for another. This means the dollar price of a year membership in BlueBlood.com has fluctuated wildly in dollars during the day today for Bitcoin users, but, hey, it has been stable in Bitcoins. :-)

It was actually less when we first planned the Bitcoin implementation, but the recent surge in Bitcoin value is why we added the free T-shirt for the first 100 folks to use the Bitcoin option. Makes it more fair and I swear we do awesome T-shirts :-)

I'm surprised by how many people think it is odd that [BlueBlood.com]( decided to add a Bitcoin payment option. While Bitcoin has the extra plus of fitting well with some of Blue Blood's punk philosophy, the site also accepts Euros, Pounds, Yen, etc. and nobody seems to find that peculiar. Like, oh noooooooos, what about the volatility of the Euro!
