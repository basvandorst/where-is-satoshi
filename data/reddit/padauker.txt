I see an unfathomably deep market and a useful/scarce resource. 
The idea behind the tech is abstract and highly disruptive which will take years to seep into public understanding. 
There is a critical mass adoption which spurs '"hyperbitcoinization'" of the global economy. Could be as soon as 2020 but likely before 2030.

"The housing market is solid. It always goes up." In hindsight, this sounds like the flat-earth theory. Yet the world believed it to be unquestionably true. While some regulations were put in place in the aftermath of the housing crisis, the system is still rotting from the inside. The underlying chronic issues were never addressed. They put a band-aid on an open-wound.
Here's the modern flat-earth theory; "America is running a healthy debt-based economy built with an inflationary currency backed by the Full Faith and Credit of the US government."
Why is inflation good for my health? I didn't get a vote for the bailout and I certainly didn't get a bonus from it. This game is rigged and it can't be beat playing by the rules.
Bitcoin is an opt-in to opt-out decentralized/permissionless value transfer system based on a capped predetermined issuance rate without a central authority. Bitcoin is the way out and the way forward. HODL!

Bitcoin is a technological innovation that challenges the status quo, in that I think we agree.
I'd argue that Bitcoin's ease-of-use (or lack thereof)  for the average user is not immediately essential for long-term success. Think of email in the 80s. You practically had to be in academia to use email then. Email didn't become mainstream until much later. 
I'd acknowledge that the use-case for Bitcoin is weak in developed nations. People in this country will not turn to bitcoin to be there bank when there are plenty to choose from (with insurance!).
That said, a decentralized and scarce resource could be seen as a financial hedge against an ever inflating dollar.  Look at the national debt over time, along with the purchasing power of the dollar over time  (especially since the 70s when America left the gold standard). While I won't say that QE is inherently bad policy, on principal, printing money makes existing money less valuable. Same is true for fractional reserve banking.
Whether bitcoin will be the first global currency is speculative (and overly optimistic given what we know today) though I hope that such a reserve currency will be decentralized. 
Otherwise we'll have a global UN-like authority issuing a digital currency.  That dystopia would be a cashless society with virtually zero fiscal privacy.
Either way digital currency is the future. Decentralized without insurance or centralized without privacy.
Easy choice for me, at least. I hope that as the technology becomes more accessible, the choice will become obvious for the masses as well.

What do you think of the growing void in American finances? Creating unprecedented amounts of debt to print currency over the last 10 years combined with Fractional reserve banking?
 Why is a US Dollar worth what it is worth? While we all assume it will be worth much less in the future (compare purchasing power over time), why should we continue to use it?
Wouldn't it better if the currency we used was solvent against its debts? Bitcoin is worth a Bitcoin because there is only 21m of them, and everyone knows this. Its value fluctuates based on market demand. 
Dollar value fluctuates due to state and corporate forces.They control supply. Therefore, demand.
They will continue to print money. And when the cards fall in favor of digital scarcity, they will be defeated.

Check out bitcoinwisdom.com and look at the volumes on different markets.
Bitcoin is predominantly traded in CNY. In the last 30 days 150mln bitcoins went through Chinese markets compared to 500k in USA markets.
If powers of ten are the psychological hurdles then 10k CNY is next, which would be around 1400 USD.

Asking for a quality discussion about a crypto besides bitcoin on this sub is a tall order. 
I agree that BTC is being sold for link, causing the recent price action. Coinbase has accelerated the shift, but it began in late May. Many people who previously considered themselves bitcoin maximalists are beginning to put ~5% of their stash into chainlink. I did so because I see the potential for a decentralized Oracle network to compliment the bitcoin network and encourage growth symbiotically. In my opinion, this is not a shitcoin to be ignored.
Edit: that 5% is now represents nearly 18% of my crypto as of this morning. I will continue to rebalance weekly into bitcoin to a 90/10 split.

The opening of a bitcoin derivatives market invites capital and a enables new manipulation vectors.
The intention of futures is to hedge against price fluctuations in a commodity.  The idea is that if you trade them on the exchange then the risk can be offloaded from the businesses that need to buy or sell these commodities onto investment banks who are (theoretically) better capable of managing the risk.  One of the theoretical advantages of a capital class is that they bear the risk.
Imagine buying contracts with one hand while forcing a liquidity spike (by buying the underlying asset, bitcoin) with the other.

I disagree, slightly. This community pushes hodling. Still a problem, though.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:07:43
Bitcoin is the reinstatment of sound money. In our runaway-debt-based global economy, Bitcoin is a black hole.
The accelerated price movements over the last 18 months reflect the liquidity shortage caused by its inhernet scarcity combined with growing awareness and legitimacy. If the CME futures market open, expect a new wave of interest to bolster the present trends.
Long term, I imagine the price discovery to follow a similar curve as the controlled supply; a decaying exponential curve flattening to an asymptote.
The supply asymptote is approaching 21M, as everyone here knows. The value asymptote is more variable (function of global population, for example) and unknown, of course, but it exists.
I would venture that price discovery begins to tamper when the supply has hit 95% of total. This should happen after the halvening after next, around 2024.

While the barrier to entry from a capital perspective is low (you only need an internet connected device to use the bitcoin network), the knowledge barrier remains out of reach for many.
The information is out there and has been for some time. However, it has not been distilled and simplified to culture widespread understanding. Sure, most Americans have heard of bitcoin, but few could describe it accurately, nevermind use it. Think of the adoption curve for email; at first it required esoteric technical prowess, now my grandma sends me memes.
The market is not efficient and won't be, until there is an intermediary (like a Bitcoin etf) that allows any Joe Blow with an etrade account to get involved.
It'll be even more time before average Joe's are comfortable buying the underlying asset.

Of course, the converse is also true, but more risky in my opinion;

@_date: 2017-11-04 05:41:57
I disagree. If I sell half of my stake in BTC for USD because i believe the price will drop after frothy growth, i  am simply materializing a gain (at a risk) in a much less volatile, albeit inferior, currency.
If I keep the other half to hedge my bet, I am still hodling.

Who said that Keynesian philosophy is threatened by Austrian? It's like saying night is  threatened by day.
Why are we living in a Keynesian model? I suppose the allure of cheap credit and easy liquidity was more appealing than measured growth based on production during industrialization. In fact I'm sure it accelerated it. It was a good model for decades. 
Doesn't mean it's sound monetary policy in the long-term. Collapse is inevitable in a system which continually attempts to fix the problems caused by inflation and debt with inflation and debt.

The opening statement:


this project has been growing exponentially.


decentralisation in the Bitcoin network. This deceptive attack was made by using a snapshot of our site
from months ago. We don’t know who might have the motivation for this kind of unethical behavior. But
as the number of people who care about Bitcoin Gold continues to grow, we feel it’s necessary to issue
a point-by-point rebuttal of some of the more egregious claims that have been made in the past 24
hours. We do believe in our product and that is the reason for the hard work that is being done every
day. We keep the development process open and transparent, and you can stay tuned and rely only on
the official sources that are mentioned below.

It's the largest and most popular blockchain, by a wide margin. If Bitcoin's existing following broadly accepted second layer features, it's likely secured it's place as a platform. In this instance, instead of comparing to Myspace or AOL, better to think of it as Ipv4. If it is to be toppled by a competing currency, it would happen gradually, in any case.

I'm on your side, but to play the devil's advocate; 
1) [There are 352 addresses with more than 3500.0 bitcoins, totaling 4,269,745 BTC, 25% of all existing bitcoins.]( In other words, 1 in 4 of all Bitcoins in existence belong to 352 addresses. Wow. Talk about unequal distribution! The gini coefficient is worse by magnitudes compared to the US dollar (which is already a highly skewed distribution!) Consider the incredible uncertainty when so few control so many BTC. Price-manipulating whales dominate this space. The millions of people who are turning their hard-earned pennies into Bitcoin run the risk of becoming bag-holders at the whim of a few dozen at the top of the rich-list. Some of those high-value addresses are exchanges, sure. But not most of them.
Now throw forks into the mix to add to that uncertainty. If the vast majority of miners choose to mine the S2X chain, block-times  on the legacy chain could be hours apart, or worse. It could be months or years before the difficulty reset. If a POW is attempted to "save" the legacy chain, its not the legacy chain anymore as it will have forked into an alt-coin while the "legacy" Bitcoin will disappear. S2X will take over and become accepted as BTC. The decentralized nature of BTC would continue to deteriorate at an accelerated pace thereafter.
(At least this is the situation as I understand it. Anyone is welcome to clarify any misstatements. In fact, additional clarity would be greatly appreciated.)

Currencies have less volatility than Bitcoin. The IRS calls it property. For now, I don't disagree.
Once Bitcoin has completed it's price discovery phase volatility should dampen. Then it'll be more broadly considered currency.
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:35:07
Sure. It is important as a medium of exchange. But it is a poor store of value. Everytime the treasury and the Federal reserve assumes debt on behalf of tax payers they are debasing everyone's savings. Not to mention the effects of fractional reserve banking.

This is the argument used to describe why a deflationary currency stifles commerce and the economy.

I think that for the next 10 years or so, Bitcoin will continue it's price discovery. It won't truly be money until the value is more stable. That will happen when everyone has it whether they like it or not.

I looked into the spread of bartering groups in the 1970s and the Feds response:  commercial and corporate bartering exchanges require filing a tax form -- a 1099-B

Decentralized digital currencies like bitcoin dis-intermediate the exchange of value via digitization.
Similar to how web and internet protocols dis-intermediated the exchange of information via digitization.

Gotta source to support that claim there, Herp?
Show me something that suggest a larger proportion of millennials aren't future-minded compared to previous generations.
According to a survey by Forbes, millennials are saving more than their predecessors. [Source]( 
Despite their efforts, the youngest generation is inheriting a global economy that is plagued by improvident monetary policy (see M1 over time, see central bank's balance sheet over time).
You think millennials are staying at home because they are lazy? Maybe some. Many are trying to save enough to put a down-payment together.
The only reason I was able to get a mortgage at 24 was because I had a major advantage over my peers; I was married (two incomes).
I've been saving (after maxing IRA) in bitcoin since I was 20, mostly because I despise the current "inflation is good for you" philosophy and don't trust the government or the Federal Reserve a fraction as much as I trust cryptography and human greed. A risky strategy I suppose, but then again, so is betting on the current investing climate, in my opinion. (How can we go from near-ubiquitous disaster in 2007 to 20000+ DOW in less than 10 years? On what grounds is this recovery built? Inflation and debt is building on sand, in my opinion.)
So far so good. For now I'm well above average among above average people. Way ahead of my peers thanks to bitcoin, exclusively.
My goal (which I share with many of my friends) is to achieve financial independence. Myriad millennials are hardworking.
Perhaps not from you, but I have sensed a seething jealousy from many of my older peers. Probably because they couldn't buy bitcoin when they were 20.

I value bitcoin because it is a transparent, permissionless and decentralized network that disintermediates global exchange of value via digitization. I'm less concerned with its market price because it is going to continue a highly volatile trend while the price discovery phase is ongoing. Even though nearly 80% of all bitcoins have been mined, the rate of growth is still over 4% per year. This rate drops in 2020 to below 2%. I suspect that volatility will be much lower after 2024, when the rate is less than 1%. 
We will see! Good luck to you.

You are confusing consensus for coercion.
Consensus among miners and some exchanges is not the same as consensus amongst the broader community. Majority hash rate means little against the will of the majority of users.
Users are the life-blood of Bitcoin. The most essential faction of the Bitcoin network. You can't claim consensus if users are being strong-armed by Miners and the BCA/DCG. That's coercion. 
You know the majority of users do not want 2X. But apparently your calculus justifies the severe risks Coinbase is taking.

Its a tricky question. If this is your first buy, then it sets your baseline. What with all the uncertainty surrounding Aug1, I wonder what I would do in your shoes.
I would likely do what I'm doing now; hedge against the value suffering from whatever may happen between now and August. There are many pieces in this game, and lately they've been moving more quickly than usual. We must wait and see if push comes to shove. Personally, I'm betting that it won't come to shove.
Coinbase fees are higher than other exchanges but they allow you to dollar cost average with a recurring buy structure (Google it) to spread your cost over time. Its a strategy that may ease your anxiety in case the value plummets.  Though you may also miss out on gains if it rockets. It's all about your tolerance for risk. Fortune favors the bold.
Personally, I prefer using gemini. It's cheaper. One lump sum and I do my best to forget about market price. After all, I'm not in this based on faith. I have the courage to stick to my convictions with this technology. Month to month may see major swings but I'm in for the long game, and that trendline is positive.
I'd encourage you to build your own foundation of understanding. Read the Bitcoin white paper, listen to Bitcoin for Beginners videos. 
When you learn enough about this innovation, you'll be all the more confident in your position  (if you choose to take one)
Good luck.

How do the unbanked acquire Bitcoin?
Anyone with a smartphone with an internet connection (and how many unbanked have these?) may download a wallet, but where do the coins come from?
If rifling through garbage is how you survive, how can you get Bitcoin?
Truth is, the people who need Bitcoin the most will be the last group to receive it. Most of the coins being bought up now are going to speculators with nothing to lose.
By the time the poor Indian scrougers find employment paying in btc, they will have missed out on the massive gains enjoyed by the lucky few who bought in today.

You go ahead and keep sipping that Kool-aid if it helps you sleep at night.
Clearly your trust in the highest echelon's economic managment hasn't been shaken by any events in recent history.
Forget that 2008 ever happened (which isn't hard since that is exactly what wall street and the federal government is doing). 
Forget how global and domestic monetary policy is skating on the thinnest ice we've seen in living memory, as foreign goverments begin dumping US treasury bonds at an unprecedented rate while the debt ceiling continues to rise, seemingly ad infinitem. 
Will you wait on the edge of your seat next time mother Yellen tells the people whether or not we'll see another measly quarter?
The US dollar is backed by the faith and credit of the US government. It needs you, desperately. Keep proppin' the good prop, bud.
I don't share a modicum of your confidence. The wage gap is larger than ever before.
Tech companies are grossly overvalued.
And are you really suggesting a trend towards energy independence? With this administration?  
Even you wouldn't claim the dollar is a store of value, would you?
I hope I'm wrong.

Seconded. This is all I could gather:
Who says only the government can make money? This year the value of the private currency bitcoin has climbed to unprecedented levels, while at the same time becoming far less volatile than in previous periods of rapidly increasing demand. Bitcoin has reached these new benchmarks despite news that might have depressed its value, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rejection of a fund permitting small traders to invest in bitcoin on the stock market.
The SEC action prompted obituaries, but bitcoin is thriving....

This is good fun. Let's see if we can have a civil conversation. No name calling!


So your primary argument for the dollar's store-of-value is government coersion? Even an unfathomable degree of sustained coersion (through tacit threat of violence) to keep the dollar's status as the Global Reserve Currency will not prevent the inflation we see every year. What is inflation, if not the devaluation of existing currency? In my opinion, inflation is mimicry of economic growth. Beyond the debt sold to the taxpayers by the Federal Reserve, fractional reserve banking and treasury bonds are commonly abused mechanisms through which "money" is created.




The jig is up in Illinois, where the state's credit rating is going to hell. Oops! No one wants Illinois Bonds anymore, no more "money-making" for them. They may be the first domino to fall. Don't fool yourself into thinking that somehow Illinois' economy isn't tethered to other states in the Union.


The same practices that lead our economy into the 2008 crash are still practised today. Bring back glass-steagall! Repeal Citizen's United! Don't you think it is unusual that the US economy is suddenly "back on top" less than a decade after the crisis? The underlying chronic problems with monetary policy and the banking sector still reek yet the noisiest people in the room are touting a 20k+ DOW without asking, "why?" Don't mention the staggeringly rapid rate at which US debt exploded. Doubled in less than a decade! Doubled! Who is going to pay this debt? When? How?


I suppose the context is humorous. So is this comment coming from a guy who think the US economy is "incredibly strong." Perhaps by the "US economy" you meant the "Ultra-rich." You must not be poor if you don't see the irony here. Good for you

Owning 1 "whole" Bitcoin is not the point.
 Owning ANY Bitcoin, however little, is still a way to get the poor man a piece of this action.
If we see a fraction of any of the outlandish predictions for Bitcoin in the next halving, a few bucks today could be worth hundreds. 
The poor who save any Bitcoin will profit like the rest. Starting at $1 dollar a week while supplies last!

Say you could sell at 25k in August 2019. Sure, rake the profits, that's a good thing for several reasons. But only close your position if you're comfortable with the possibility that Bitcoin may be worth 35k in December 2020. Or 500k if you listen to John "eatmydick" McAfee. 
I've found peace and profits in Bitcoin and here's my unsolicited six satoshis:
 
•You cannot predict Bitcoin. Period. 
•Study it. Share it. Use it. Save it.
Newbies will find that following this advice is challenging. Emotionally challenging, especially, and much more so if they have financial challenges in establishing their positions. It's so easy to *think* you know. We tend to think *Its up/down N% over only M days, the value of Bitcoin must go up/down!* While *sometimes* we may be right, we are also sometimes wrong. And being wrong sucks. I argue that its not worth the risk.

I've been in this space for a few years now and I have always been drawn to Bitcoin because it is free from centralized government control.
However, it is not free from outside influence, as illustrated by several recent events.
The [Gini Coefficient]( describes inequality in closed systems. Whether or not you believe in this particular metric, it does raise the concern of wealth distribution in the Bitcoin network.
I found this website called bitcoinprivacy.net where you can find distribution statistics by amount of Bitcoin held per wallet.
For example, by specifying an amount of bitcoin, say 1000 or 4000, the site will respond with:
"There are 1,601 addresses with more than 1000.0 bitcoins, totaling 6,369,723 BTC, 39% of all existing bitcoins."
and 
"There are 316 addresses with more than 4000.0 bitcoins, totaling 4,185,816 BTC, 25% of all existing bitcoins."
That is, 1 in 4 bitcoins is sitting in 1 of 316 individual wallets, some of which may share a common owner.
When ever I find myself discussing Bitcoin with non-believers, the uncertainty regarding this extreme distribution is  a valid criticism which I stumble over in my responses.
My usual retort is to compare Bitcoin's Gini Coefficent (0.99) to USD (0.8), where 1 is absolute inequality and 0 is absolute equality.
How does the community respond to outside concern regarding the extreme inequality?

Bitcoin isn't inflationary. That is the difference.
You should know that over time the USD continues to lose purchasing power. The fed will not publish hard figures, but most people agree the inflation rate is around 3% annually. Do the math yourself. The USD cannot be a store of value if it is perscribed to lose that value with time.

I want a future-proof currency. 
I want to save a money which satisfies the three principal qualities of currency to the best of humanity's technological prowess.
1. Store of value
2. Medium of exchange
3. Unit of account
I believe whole-heartedly that cryptocurrencies are the future. Not a modicum of doubt in my mind about it. 
However, I'm not convinced that Bitcoin is destined to become the global standard. Perhaps that's​ because I'm presently unversed the inner-workings of this technology.
In 10 years will my dishwasher buy its electricity using some token on the Ethereum network or on a Bitcoin sidechain?
Right now I have no reason to believe one outcome is more likely than the other. Hence I am considering rebalancing my hodlings. I sold all but 3¢ worth of Ethereum earlier this year. Now it's worth $1.50.
My greatest hesitation with Ethereum, the reason I sold, is due to the seemingly controlled supply by private interests. Bitcoin's supply cap appears rock-solid next to Ethereum's wishy-washy inflation schedule.
Then again, perhaps the protocol shift from PoW ---&gt; PoS (a transition that still is unclear to me) would invalidate this supply concern.

I wouldn't bother reading about pedagogy..  Read about Bitcoin. If you can comprehend the white paper and basic economics (manipulative/cognitive market pressure, supply/demand), you should know enough to proselytize Bitcoin to anyone willing to listen. 
Offering the use cases for this technology is the trick. People cling to the almighty dollar. For now.
Good money always replaces bad money.
