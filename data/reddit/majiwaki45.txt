Again, ask anyone living anywhere that looks notably different from the majority and speaks with an accent, and see how often they're assumed to be a citizen.

They're just as welcoming as any other country, and a lot more than others. Try asking some non-white immigrants to the US or the U.K. or whathaveyou about how welcomed they were. They'll have more stories than most immigrants to Japan.
Japan gets a bad rap because its a economic powerhouse itself and doesn't feel the need to grovel to western immigrants; they get treated like most immigrants are all over the world, and a lot of western immigrants completely freak out at suddenly not being the implicit superior in every interaction.

It damn near is though. Learn a bit of Japanese and it's virtually the cleanest, safest, nicest place in the world.

You can apply just like anyone else; plenty of people do.
Jus soli citizenship like the US is actually relatively uncommon worldwide.

Japan is hands down the easiest first world nation to immigrate to; all you need is a university degree and a company that will sponsor you for a visa. Quite few people are denied, no quotas, even fresh university grads with no experience can work there.
It's relatively homogenous but what does that mean? Many places in the world are homogenous outside of major international cities, but that doesn't mean you'll have and material difficulty living there.
