I've gone the opposite way - I'm an American living in the UK and I'm still paid in USD by an American company. 
I've got 2 suggestions:
1.) Since its for work, the company should reimburse your partner for any fews associated with the trip on currency exchanges. Have them look into how submitting expenses work at their company. I would assume they also have a per diem as part of the trip so they may already know and just may need to ask about currency exchange fees.
2.) I know you are looking for a BTC option but I'd actually suggest not using BTC in this case due to past experience. I do have a bank account in both regions and actually tried to use BTC but I found the quickest, easiest, and cheapest way to transfer the money is to use [Transferwise]( They give the actual current exchange rate and only charge a small fee. I regularly send 2-3k USD at a time and am charged around 20-30 dollars. It usually takes about 24 hours. Been absolutely great to me so far. The only caveat would be that you'd need an American bank account to send it to but if you have the account details for an American friend, that would work too

I know him! Bill Barnett is awesome. Granted, maybe I am a bit jaded because I am friends with his son, but he is an all around good guy. Glad to see he is hopping on the BTC wagon. 
I bet I could get him (or at least his son who is mentioned in the article) to do an AMA if anybody is interested? *nudge *
