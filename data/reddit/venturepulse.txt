\&gt;can drop 80% in around a years time
If you measure BTC in dollars, then yes. Otherwise 1 BTC will always be 1 BTC. It just needs a lot more adoption and real trading volume.

You probably never been residing in 3rd world countries. 
Most people there can't even open a bank account.

Careful. Some people get caught "stealing" electricity

what if your address would be blacklisted and all other peers are restricted from dealing with you? For example other peers would risk being blacklisted as well for interacting with your address.

I think nobody would give you chance to short it lol.

Everyone even your GF seem to be in control of you. If she stopped believing in you, maybe you should consider a change?

Read again, **cashless** world. There can be no bank run because there is nowhere to run to (except for Bitcoin of course).

\&gt;If I was moving a million dollars i would be perfectly happy paying significantly more fees to ensure that if I mis-typed a number, my money is not lost forever.
With banks there is only illusion of assurance. They can hold your money indefinitely (with different reasonings) especially if its large amount. Some banks do need you to request for cash days before in case you are withdrawing even $5k.
The risk is still there. If you were to ask me, I'd still prefer to be the one who fucked up compared to getting screwed by bank

You didnt get my idea. The point is, with cash its harder for the government to target specifically you.

Try sending belly button lint across the borders in 1 hour without any logistics risk and paying for transportation $2 :)

Credit card processing usually takes **a lot** in fees so Im not sure it can be avoided.

I'm more talking about the fact that paper cash cannot be seized by pushing a button on a keyboard or worse, automated algorithm.

A person might be just trying out how it feels like to transact Bitcoin. Why so rude?
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:15:00
Well.. I like cashless: much less hassle handling the paper bills. However the downside of being cashless is your money is not yours anymore. Hence I prefer Bitcoin because I keep the control over my money.
