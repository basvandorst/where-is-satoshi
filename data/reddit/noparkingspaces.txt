The file name is NdLEoUJCqNLlZFQBKEr7lxTK-PKQjqi5FtBM8k5lqs8, likely a hash? I'm unequipped to solve this, but good luck!

Well said.

1. Xapo deactivated its card.
2. Even if it hadn't, Xapo was a bitcoin-based card... did you lose track of the argument? The whole point was that bitcoin was breaking fiat's non-consensus paradigm...
3. It (fiat) is the only legal tender. So again, no, not just needed for courts and taxes--if you tried paying with anything else (i.e. exiting fiat) you'd be charged with aml and terrorism.

Exactly. The grandma argument is a great argument.

Again, you can't exit fiat without reprisal. It's illegal. The fact that it's illegal means different monies can't compete for consensus. Do people use the current monopoly? yes. Does the current monopoly add value compared with the alternative (i.e. not using money)? Yes. Those don't go against my argument.

We already have currencies, this one is uniquely useful not simply because it is a currency.

Thank you for making me polish my argument further.
Point  It's correct to say that anything that is used voluntarily is being agreed to. Therefore, used voluntarily en masse = internal consensus by participants. This is very insightful, thank you.
Point  If you were to try to exit the fiat system and make payments (say, using gold or silver) you'd be charged with aml, kyc and terrorism. You can't exit fiat easily--exiting fiat to a different fiat isn't exiting fiat.
Furthermore, a choice between just fiat isn't a voluntary accepting of fiat (or its rules). That'd be like if I put a gun to your head and gave you a choice between watching transformers and ghostbusters 2; choosing one would not be voluntary or indicate preference of such blockbuster films.
So while I don't get to arbitrarily dictate what a high cost of exit is--it is quite clear we can draw the line at the use of force and imprisonment.
If it was legal to use other monies as legal tender, and if you weren't obligated to pay your taxes in fiat by threat of force, I'd agree with you its use was by consensus. 
Point  Currency, therefore, can be currency even without consensus regarding its rules. If people are forced to use it for payments, such a monopoly grants it value, certainly, but not actual voluntary acceptance of its rule base. That matters, because with bad rules (e.g. centralized money issuance) the value can degrade very easily, but since its use and agreement to such rules are not voluntary, people have little recourse in such a scenario as they can't exit that currency easily.

lol I don't agree, but of all the comments in this thread so far you seem to be the only one who actually read the post. So kudos

Thank you. I'm surprised the post survived after the initial flurry of downvotes. I get that people don't like Blankfein, but it'd be foolish to dismiss the idea for that reason.

Awesome! I'm doing the same. Glad my post had an impact.
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:47:52
I don't agree that my argument was tedious and pedantic
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:53:33
If your currency has a high cost of exit, you're not participating in its use voluntarily. The rules of fiat are determined, therefore, by fiat--not consensus.
