Here's a novel idea: Just don't use flash. You're an idiot plain and clear. Instead of doing the sensible thing and disabling flash you are disabling a scripting tool provided by your browser that adds quite a useful layer to the browsing experience.
You've just proven every point I've made. Javascript cannot inject malware. It can tell you the user has flash installed. But if you're that paranoid about malware, just uninstall flash dummy.

Lets look at this wikipedia article:


Not an issue. Modern browsers disable this. You have to use CORS.


Not a vulnerability. This is the client attacking the javascript source not the other way.


The key is the last sentence `Google Chrome similarly confines its page renderers to their own "sandbox".` :) Again: Uninstall flash


Old browsers (IE6?)

You obviously have no idea what you're talking about. I've been a web developer for 19 years :) Here's an idea: 
@_date: 2014-01-23 10:32:09

@_date: 2014-01-24 10:37:53
That's bullshit. The only way you can detect is via reading the user agent or browser settings. Both of which are usually in the initial request and can be abused using any server side language

@_date: 2014-01-24 11:00:29
Really? Again: MALWARE CANNOT BE INSTALLED DIRECTLY WITH JAVASCRIPT. Java: yes. Flash: Yes. Javascript: No. Disabling javascript isn't protecting you from any more malware than had you just disabled java and used a decent browser.
I'm sick and tired of idiot conspiracy theorists talking shit on a language they know fuck all about.

Just because you lost an account on a brand of device and an exploit was reported weeks later doesn't mean it was that exploit. Again: Occam's razor.

That's a PHP exploit due to poor coding. Not Javascript :) You can insert anything onto the page. I don't think you know what XSS means.

That's to do with tracking. I can get your browser user agent string and the like server side without javascript enabled. Provide me with a single example of a payload being delivered with javascript. Not with anything else. Just plain javascript. I dare you.
Here's a hint: *It doesn't exist*
You should actually learn about how your browser works and the engines behind these languages before you make yourself look like a fool like that :)
@_date: 2014-01-24 14:03:39
Impossible to access the filesystem with javascript ;)
@_date: 2014-01-23 10:30:41
That's Firefox 17. The message there is don't use that browser. Not don't use JavaScript. If all audits had faulty gear sticks you wouldn't tell someone to not use a gear stick. You'd tell them not to use an audi. 
The rest of that is to do with link changing. Something that's available without JavaScript and is harmless enough for google to use. 
What am I trying to achieve? I'm trying to get people to stop listening to you tinfoil hat freaks that think JavaScript is the devils spawn. As a web developer with 7 years JS experience I can tell you it's not. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 09:36:15
Just as a note for stuff in future: 9 times out of 10 I find that scam websites suck at providing valid WHOIS information. If you check out  and enter the domain, look for obvious fake information.
If there is none or it's got whois privacy, try sending an email to the email listed there. If it bounces back *or* any of the information is incorrect just contact ICANN and they will take down the domain.
If anyone remembers that horrible DayZ clone, their whois email bounced, I emailed ICANN and within 2 days their domain was seized.

Then you're fine ;) I'm exactly the same but it's just a warning for everyone else because most seem to think that you have to download a file and open it to be infected
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:18:39
No, they are clearly not. I think you need to hire new programmers if writing the same thing in a different language makes any kind of difference
@_date: 2014-01-24 15:17:45
Nope it doesn't. Can be done with Java/Flash :)
@_date: 2014-01-22 19:46:05
Again: If you're not retarded browsing the internet then you don't have to worry about malware. You are aware that Java != Javascript right? Because Java is the one that can download malware in the background. Not javascript.
Java is a completely different thing and if you run Java applets there is a massive risk of undetected malware being downloaded and installed without you clicking anything. You cannot install malware onto a users computer using *Javascript*
You are either trolling or you have no idea what you are talking about. Either way: Go die in a fire :)
@_date: 2014-01-24 16:01:34
BTW: That 'javascript exploit' you keep harping on about isn't a reason to disable javascript. It's a reason to look into the security layout of a company before investing heavy capital in it.
That exploit is some lazy developer somewhere set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` to `*` to hit some deadline. Nothing to do with javascript. The request could've been made with PHP or an iFrame if they wanted. But they chose JS. There's a million and one PHP exploits out there and even more lazy developers. If a company is hacked because they used a weak hashing algorithm (which they are.. every single day (cough adobe)) is the language implementation of that hashing algorithm to blame? Are you never going to use another PHP site in case there's another lazy developer out there? No. Bollocks are you. It's because a shit developer somewhere wasn't doing his job properly.

@_date: 2014-01-25 19:43:15
But the danger isn't to do with Javascript
@_date: 2014-01-24 12:18:06
Again: Try it. Does it work? No? Then it's adequate. If you've ever tried to do cross-domain ajax requests in a project then you'd know the security protection is in place.
But of course, you haven't because you're just a normal person that has no idea about javascript

The difference between OSX and iOS is simple: You don't have to use the app store on OSX. It's optional. You can download programs from wherever you want so it won't stop you being able to download a wallet from online.
Switching from OSX is silly
@_date: 2014-01-24 10:35:53
All of which are complete and utter crap. Talking about link jacking or what not. That's not installing malware. Javascript *cannot* installing malware. Period.
@_date: 2014-01-24 15:15:34
Anyway I'm getting bored of arguing with such an infant. I won't reply from now on. I'll  just write this off to you not having a clue what you are talking about.

Yes, I see the difference. That's not a vulnerability. It's a feature. If you don't have HTML5 video enabled then I can serve an alternate method of delivering video.
Again: If you're worried about javascript finding out you have flash and exploiting flash: Uninstall flash.
@_date: 2014-01-24 14:05:47
But they don't need to check java versions you plank. All java versions are compatible with the latest drive by exploit

Couldn't give a fuck
@_date: 2014-02-05 13:07:03
I haven't touched it, but be *very* careful clicking a link to a download like this. Even if you delete the downloaded file, it's possible you could be sent to a java driveby which installs the malware and then forwards you over to a download page.
Then you *think* you're safe but in reality you're already infected before the file downloads.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:04:52

@_date: 2014-01-22 19:45:12
Go ahead, tell me why I'm lying instead of throwing a bunch of useless insults at me. Because you must be aware that javascript cannot install malware. If you think it can, then you are an idiot.
@_date: 2014-01-24 11:46:20
One idiot spouting crap about something he has no experience with doesn't affect my salary.
@_date: 2014-01-24 13:36:45
Do you have any idea what you are talking about? The vunerability there comes from the PHP side of things. Something like: `echo $_GET['example']`. If someone finds an XSS attack they won't execute javascript on the clientside so disabling it won't stop any malicious activity.
If they had half a brain cell they would inject a drive-by java applet. But of course, you *think* you know what you're talking about when in reality a 12 year old with a 'programming for dummies' book probably has more knowledge on the subject at hand.
Sure you *can* run JS. But as I've said again and again: You can't run malicious code on the computer with plain JS. So the worst they could probably do is restyle the page.
@_date: 2014-01-24 11:44:15


The chances are not worth the extra work and drop in productivity after javascript is disabled.


Nope. They don't. Open the browser console and type `$.get(' Then read the resulting error. Look it up.
@_date: 2014-02-02 15:20:10

No, they won't. It's a completely different market. They would be absolutely insane to cut off a large percentage of mac users / the ecosystem. The iPhone started sandboxed. OSx however started open and we will see them stop selling macs before they move to an iOS-esque lockdown.
The mac appstore generates hardly any revenue in comparison to the cost of the hardware ($2k+.) Whereas an iPhone generates Apple ~$3-400 in profit per unit sold and they recoupe the costs via the appstore. Look at Amazons kindle fire for an example of that.
The revenue is generated via the hardware with mac sales *not* the software. Hence why OSX doesn't have any DRM/licensing junk like windows does because they couldn't care less about loosing the money they charge for the OS

The problem with chargebacks usually isn't someone saying 'I never recieved the product!' The problem is that they usually say 'I never bought the product!'
Yes you could prove the seller sent the bitcoin, but you can't prove the address is linked to the credit card holder. Then the bank will just look at it as the user having their credit card stolen and cancel the payment regardless of any evidence.
Just like a hacker can use your card to send themselves tracked parcels. Even though you can prove it's arrived, you can still charge back because you never ordered it.

Oh fuck off. There is really no reason to disable javascript if you're good at browsing the web.

Two completely different things. You cannot install malware with javascript.

I don't understand why people are still with PayPal. I had to deal with their shit about 4-5 years ago when I was using it as a payment gateway. They seized a lot of money for 6 months and shut down my account for literally no reason.
When I say no reason, I'm not just bullshitting. I rang them up 4 months after being frozen and the woman told me that she couldn't see why I had been closed. They re-opened my account for 3 weeks and done exactly the same thing. Since then I haven't touched them.

@_date: 2013-12-16 10:03:46

But that's the thing: It would be valid if there was a 'reply to user' button or something. But the fact is: There's not. The mention feature on Github is to get other users' attention. The majority of threads I've seen it used on use it to involve users in the discussion that hasn't posted or even seen the issue just yet.
How would it link a mention to a post? Would you have a 'reply to post' button? Then that takes a lot longer than just typing their name. If you don't have that button then you are left with the possibility that it randomly links to a post you didn't want.
It's pointless really. You expect a link named after a profile to link to that profile. Just like you expect a link with a thread name to link to that thread. The same with a reply.

@_date: 2013-04-12 15:58:37
But you shouldn't have to do that. For it to work as a currency, it can't fluctuate like it is at the moment. Say I bought 1 bitcoin at the start of the day and wanted to buy a pair of shoes that cost $100. At the start of the day I could. Then suddenly I would've needed 2 bitcoins. Then 1.5 bitcoins. Then 1 bitcoin. This was just in *one day.* The fact that I can go eat lunch, come back and see that I suddenly can't afford what I could beforehand is ridiculous. Hopefully it sorts out.

That's true. I'm hoping that the price will go down and it'll stay stable. The hype at the moment is largely because it's making people money. I can't see it being used as a currency at the moment which is a big shame as it's something I really want

Hmm. I'm unsure if it's just because it's bitcoin. They are probably getting a lot of payments to them so it looks suspicious. My bank (Natwest) has done this before. I bought a coffee and they froze my account because they didn't think it was me. Although it took me like 10 minutes on the phone to them to fix it.

I'm not entirely sure on it myself yet (still reading about it) but it involves 'hashing'. Basically they hash the transactions passed + a random string and it returns a string:
That string has to started with a certain number of 0's (the difficulty)  :) 
When a block is mined it is sent out to the network to be 'confirmed' and then everyone else checks that the block is valid. You *could* switch the difficulty to be insanely easy but as soon as it's sent out nobody will confirm it and the block will be invalid. Much in the same way transactions happen. You can report a transaction on a coin you've already spent but nobody will confirm it.

No neither. It makes it annoying to read for most people. Start typing your replies on reddit in all caps and see how many people don't mind. It'll be very few. It's annoying because they way you've been taught grammar tells you to read a word that's in all caps as it's being shouted. That means every now and again my inner monologue starts shouting and it's super annoying. If you want to make a word have more impact use italics.
Like *this*. It had nothing to do with being a grammar nazi.

No. A number of obvious telltale signs:
A) The website design. Are they even trying?
B) The transaction numbers are cut off at the end. If they had nothing to hide, why would they bother?
C) The 'coins in pot' thing is completely fake. It's a piece of javascript that randomly takes a coin every now and again.
D) Check the payment addresses. Only a few payments to each (despite having hundreds listed on the site) + they are all incoming.

The key difference being that in PayPal you can't create dollars without putting them into the system. If $1 exists in PayPal it's because that $1 has been deposited by someone at some point in time. So it's come from the banking system and will likely go back at some point.
Bitcoin is different in the fact that I can mine 1BTC and then buy stuff off you with that BTC without ever mentioning a bank. You cannot do that on PayPal
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:58:29
I don't know a lot about bitcoins, but just looking at those transactions, you'll see quite a bunch of large transactions &gt;1000 btc. One of them is 15,776. At the time of writing, 1 bitcoin is worth $89. That would make that single transaction worth $1,404,064

You don't seem to understand the case. The antitrust case was because Microsoft was using their monopoly on the OS industry to push separate products. 
They never blocked Netscape. They just made IE come preinstalled. Apple don't have a monopoly and they aren't pushing any of their products. They simply banned one thing from their App store. HUGE difference.

It's sad to see people are getting scammed by this. It seems it was redesigned in the last few days but last week I posted a few reasons as to why you can be certain it's a scam.
1. The transaction addresses are cut short. Should be the first red flag. They look legitimate but without even a single letter at the end they are absolutely meaningless.
2. Look at the address you are meant to send to in the blockchain. You'll see loads of one way transactions but nothing back (
3. The odds. There is no way in hell anybody would be able to sustain a business on those odds. Even if it looks tempting to 'just try' there is no chance it's going to be real. Apply the logic in real life. If you saw someone in the street you'd never met telling you that he can double your money and you're almost guaranteed to win, would you take him up on that offer and give him $500? I'm pretty certain you wouldn't.
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:27:49
Good explanation :) The mathematical puzzle I believe from what I've read is to do with hashing:
Basically hashing takes a large piece of data and turns it into an irreversible unique string of characters. That same piece of data will always return that same hash and nothing else will (well, eventually something will but the world is more likely to explode before it does.) So the transactions are grouped together and hashed. But a random string is added to the end of that group of transactions to make the string unique to everyone that tries. The reward and new page comes when someone gets a hash returned that starts with x amount of zeros. X is the difficulty. 
So people keep hashing with different random strings in an attempt to get the block. It's easy to get a hash with 1 or two zeros on the end but there are more and more combinations required to get anything above that. So if the difficulty is 10 (10 zeros at the start) it would take a *long* time to find a random string that returns that (along with all the transactions.)
