atm there is 70k unconfirmed transactions so you're not alone.
Someone posted website on this sub I believe where you enter your wallet id and it helps your transaction to get confirmed faster but I dont know url

Just tried sending some. indeed fees and times more reasonable now but without scaling regular growing bitcoin use will match attacks and segshit wont improve anything

LMAO. Just 18 days after fork fees are now higher than they were before 4 FUCKING USD if you want it confirmed in couple blocks. Bitcoin core is pathetic joke BCH just proved that 8MB blocks work, fees are awesome, people who complain about need for petabytes to host node are stupid or something? Did they forget technology is evolving and HDD costs per gigabyte are steadily going down by the time BCH needs terabytes to store blockchain it will be dirt cheap to own 10tb drives. RIP BITCOIN 2017.

better vision, developers and roadmap = clogged network with 2mb blocks probably never coming, gradually increasing fees and those loved lunatic developers getting rich af. loving it

are you saying they drastically dropped after fork? because like week ago when used bitcoin paid usual 2$+ per transaction. rather use bank and get better rates.

Im not following.. so people agree that less than 100$ transactions dosen't belong on chain and bitcoin was never intended for daily small transactions? what the fuck? I thought its exact opposite. cheap fast transactions and daily use. wow.. im out. enjoy soon to be $5+ fees on each transaction. fuck bitcoin.

totaly dude and not because I want original bitcoin vision to be real

That is real bitcoin subreddit. this one is just glorification of 3k a coin and hodling memes. whole bitcoin now seems like financial disaster waiting to happen. 
rip to everyones money who thinks that bitcoin wont crash very very hard after taxes reach some point where its just not worth it when there is already cheaper faster alternatives.

I just want lower fees and faster confirmations and now bitcoin is shitshow cant wait until it crashes so hard that all those pools and miners bankrupt on their own greed

I want bitcoin to be superior alternative to personal or even commercial banking. Imagine levels of automation you can do in e-commerce when you dont have to work with tons of apis for each bank or payment service just one bitcoin pay from anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world in secconds with reasonable fees. Technology is here. everything is here to achieve it but as always greed and idiots ruin all nice things. 
If ethereum isnt just a bubble then im fine if it becomes  crypto but this just delays everything. Bitcoin is already widely known and accepted in a lot places while eth is not only if we could apply this damn patch to core and move on but no...

such a revolution 3 years without any agreement, 2-3$ per transaction and hours of waiting before confirming. 
true currency of the future
