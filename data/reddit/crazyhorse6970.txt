Ok, maybe I am missing something here or am just flat out dumb lol, but here, I'll go through exactly what happened in detail... So, I received the btcs into my wallet using my main address, was then prompted by the blockchain app to secure them in "My Bitcoin Wallet", a separate address, something that I don't usually do, but have done on occasion, with no issues, when I wasn't planning on sending the btcs out immediately.  So, about two hours later, log back in to my wallet, no issues, all of the btcs are still right where I left them, I then clicked to send a transaction, chose the send from address, chose the send to address, was typing in the amount to be sent (and in the bottom right it had the usual accurate amount available to send minus the transaction fees), typed the amount to send, hit send, got the message "insufficient funds" or whatever their terminology for that is.  Figured maybe for some reason the transaction fee got jacked up, so went, looked at the fee, confirmed it was right, went back, entered the amount again, same error message.  Went back to the main page the wallet, total amount of btc is 0.00 btc.  Freaked out for a sec, went and checked transactions and boom, right there, less than a minute prior my entire balance was sent to some random ass wallet address.  One I've never seen before, and definitely not the one I put in on the transaction screen before I cancelled it out.  So, I think that's every conceivable detail I can think of, hopefully that will help shed some light on the situation.  And once again, all help here is much appreciated.

I understand that there's a 99.9% chance that I'll never see those coins again, but I'm holding out a tiny bit of hope for that 0.1% chance that someone knows/sees something here that I'm not.  And more importantly, the main reason for my post was to figure out just wtf happened.  I like knowing why things happen, that allows you to have a better chance of preventing it from happening again.  I'd like some insight into the details of what most likely occurred here.  There's clearly something I could've done better on my part so that this didn't happen, and I'd like to know/learn what to do going forward.

Ok, maybe I am a bit more of a n00b here than I thought...I understand and appreciate what you posted, but I'm not fully grasping it.  The one thing I'm noticing is that exactly a week ago a miniscule payment was sent from that same address to that same address, but other than that, I guess I don't know enough about the technicalities here to fully understand.  Is that showing that I actually somehow set up some type of automatic transaction from that initial wallet address?  Sorry if these are dumb questions.

Gotcha, I really appreciate the help and suggestions.  So basically, to summarize everything, as it stands, there is currently nothing that I can do to speed up this specific transaction, correct?  It's pretty much just a waiting game on my end now if I understand everything that has been said correctly.

And even on the fees website ( I get that everything is backed up right now, but my fee still falls in the 0-3 blocks on average confirm time...and I'm still pushing 3 hours now without a confirmation, guess I'm just really confused.

I actually have the Electrum wallet as well, but I think I'd try the other one you mentioned for this one time transaction...could you point me in the direction of how to properly execute a CPFP transaction? I just did a Google search for it but couldn't find a really good "how-to" for it and I DEFINITELY don't want to mess this up.

Honestly, the easiest ways for me when I was a beginner were LocalBitcoins and Paxful.  I wasn't a fan of all of the verification that needed to be provided to Coinbase.  But with both LBC and Paxful, you can pretty much pick and choose what payment method you'd like to use and how much/little documentation to provide as well, depending on the offer and seller.  I'd personally start there.

Sadly, check out the thread I opened a couple hours ago...think I'm in the same boat as you...and I used about 243 sat...
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:18:39
So then what should I use for a basis for my future fees then? Because I've never really had this problem before (does seem like I'm just unlucky this time) and I used a higher fee this time to try and ensure it would go through quickly, the average time for my fee is 0-3 blocks, so I guess I don't know what I should look at to seem whether my fee is sufficient for the confirm time I'm looking for at that point in time.

Yeah, same here, I emailed Mycelium support to try and figure out why there's an option for CPFP after you send a transaction, but when I click it, it says "CPFP isn't necessary for this transaction" lol, kinda defeats the purpose of having it...
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:52:47
Here's a link to that screenshot of the options for a transaction in Mycelium... 
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:47:24
Hey, thanks for the prompt response. Yeah Mycelium has support for a couple of things for each transaction. I'm going to upload a screenshot that shows the options for each transaction. I already re-broadcasted the transaction about 30 minutes to an hour ago, but haven't seen any difference yet from that. I then tried to bump the fee with CPFP but when I click on that option, I get message that says "bumping not neccesary" lol.  So it seems like I'm just stuck which is really annoying when I paid almost $1 fee on about a $70 transaction :/

Great idea with that live feed! Thanks for showing me that. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:07:01
Haha, seriously though...mine finally went through as well also sometime around 2 am or so.  And, I looked back at my transactions from yesterday, I had sent a transaction with a fee almost exactly HALF the size of the transaction that got stuck, and I had sent it 3 or 4 minutes prior to the one that got stuck and it got confirmed 5 minutes after I sent it lol. So, yeah, live and learn I guess!

Okay, so hypothetically speaking, if I could export my private key from my change address, what would be the best/easiest wallet to import it into? And could you also briefly explain or direct me to an explanation of exactly how to import a private key into another wallet? I'm pretty sure I know how to do so, but I always like to read long explanations because knowledge is power haha.

The original address still shows in my list of unused addresses, just the current receiving address is different, the initial address I was talking about is the only address listed under the payment request tab, it just isn't the initial receive address/qr code that I would send or use for receiving when I open the wallet right now
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:52:14
Ok, good to know, thanks.
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:21:00
Perfect, that's what I thought and was just the answer I was looking for.  Just wanted to double check.  Thanks for the prompt response!
