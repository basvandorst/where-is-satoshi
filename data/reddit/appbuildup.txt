I have tried explaining this to some of the gambling addicts that believe in due numbers and other nonsense, but it seems that the only way they learn is when they reach rock bottom. Paradoxically those who win big early are really the biggest losers. When your brain doesn't register that high then you're a lot less likely to return.

Ignore this advice. If you believe in Bitcoin then hold, if you bought in just for a quick profit then sell. Trying to time something so volatile as cryptocurrency is fools game and is pure gambling.

First of all, I haven't invested in the cryptos. I don't fully understand them and I have no idea what is likely to happen in the future. I'm just following them out of curiosity. 
I don't have time to explain why "buy low, sell high, diversify" doesn't work in practice for most people. You will have to learn for yourself.

You are saying to buy low and sell high. Usually, it is said by someone who has no idea what he's talking about. 
What I'm saying is to not speculate on cryptos.

That has to be one of the worst technical analysis I have seen yet. Thanks for the laugh

True, but it doesn't mean that the price will go up...

I learned this in 2008. Now I only invest in things that I understand and believe in.
