someone's butthurt by this dump I guess. It's normal with Bitcoin man. It's just too good of an opportunity to miss. See you again on the way up with my big fat long ;)
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:41:05
LOL there's about 24k longs in bitmex rn, a whale dumping ccould put us below 11k.
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:10:11
Jesus that's how markets work. You can't buy anything if no one is selling.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:24:52
Yeah right keep holding while the big boys make serious bucks
@_date: 2019-07-29 02:57:16
Lmao talk again in 3 yrs

Not daytrade per se 'cause there's no "closing" when it comes to trading BTC but it's pretty profitable. I just trade 10% of my stack so I can accumulate more. Recent move is due to breakout, we've basically found a "bottom" and is now expecting it to go high. We could be seeing something beyond the previous high (13900). Of course this is not a guarantee but charts are looking good.
@_date: 2019-07-07 08:50:19
Goodmorning Bitcoiners! Seems like we have a pretty sturdy support at 11050, considering we're just below 11k yesterday and now trading at 11200 (after that failed little run) I'd say this is a good spot to long. Now we just have to wait for the weekend pump.
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:40:57
lol now I'm 100% sure you are a kid. Don't confuse analysis with baseless predictions. You must be one of the moonboys gang. Enjoy your usd300 bump, pathetic.
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:12:48
I doubt there'd be too much of these $50m+ cross-border transactions you're talking about enough to push the price $500 go sideways and push it down again. Barts usually happen during low volume sessions and huge orders can easily move the market. It happens during times of consolidation after parabolic runs and huge dumps around areas of support/resistance. There's also the "reverse" bart where a huge dump is followed by sideways action along well-tested support levels, once rejected price goes up again. Same principle really so that invalidates the buy-send-sell pattern of cross-border payments.
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:50:53
If you margin trade at 9400 and placed a long there you'd be filthy rich rn. Not all margin traders are bearish.

100m sell wall on Binance got eaten pretty good. Now let's wait for this mofo to buy it again . . .

Guys, remember the prophecy  [ 
 9200 on July . . .
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:07:26
Well hi there. How’s your stack rn?
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:24:45
A lot of TA crowd are calling for 8k because that’s the ideal place to accumulate. We touch that area and we’re surely in for a treat by EOY, I’m talking 30k-55k. Yes no one can predict BTCs PA to the dot, but given the right factors it’s not that hard to map where we should be in order to take new highs. We are in a bull market ffs, these pullbacks are temporary, we can very much get it back in a few days.
@_date: 2019-07-06 15:44:23
yeah keep dreaming while we enjoy the current price irl ;)
@_date: 2019-07-14 11:44:51
we're still bullish until 6k. Lower here would just make a bullflag, eitherway this is just a short-term setback
@_date: 2019-07-14 12:40:54
9800 by closing
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:12:00
pump 700usd and bleed back down to death . . .
@_date: 2019-07-15 12:44:23
It's just as bad as those expecting it to go straight up. A little pessimism could help this market in the long run. There are far way more bullish posts here than those saying it'll go down. Short/mid-term I'm expecting another pull back, and yes 8k is not too far fetched, we need that so we can break previous ATHs. Just look at historical charts of BTC, people always say that BTC is unpredictable but it has already done this at least 3 times before breaking previous ATH. Pullback to 8k-9k is NOT a bad thing, it's a necessity after months of grinding upwards. Even 6k would still put us in the green since we started this run, it'll only hurt if you panic sell.
@_date: 2019-07-15 15:12:11
Let's see each other again in a few hrs ;)
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:41:29
8500 solid support
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:16:44
I'm just trying to comfort the people here, not that I care about these predictions. I'm long term bullish but I like riding the ups and downs by trading a small portion of my holdings. It's just cool to see that that image has been pretty accurate these past few months although you're right, statistically speaking one prediction ought to be slightly accurate from the hundreds of incorrect ones.
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:09:10
BRING OUT THE VEGETA MEMES!
@_date: 2019-07-14 10:14:27
nah, I'm bullish long term. But I'm not gonna sit on the side with this kind of PA. Made more than 2 yrs worth of salary just with TA bullshit so I guess I got that going which is nice while people with "decent" amount of BTC cries in the corner. I'm just giving OP some insight on whether it can go lower.
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:55:55
I use Exodus and Greenwallet, not bad since you can convert BTC easily. That's where I put my easily accessible funds from trades. Then long term HODLing I use Trezor.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:48:38
LOL was laughing my ass off when it bounced. I'm bleeding bad rn but I'm gonna HODL this till $0
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:49:21
Yeah pennant just broke upwards, we'll probably see new highs the coming days.
@_date: 2019-07-14 10:03:26
10200 will be the nextt support. I'm earning a lot from my short. Will reassess my position when we hit 10200, either we go lower or bounce
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:31:48
lol you seriously think this little news is enough to keep us afloat? must be new in this space. We can go up to 11200 without breaking the downtrend kiddo.
@_date: 2019-07-09 08:52:33
thinking more of 16-17k tops this time then back to 12500. This level has been tested since the previous rally to local high, would make a very good support.
@_date: 2019-07-28 21:19:30
If you have to ask other people to know BTC's true value then you're here for the wrong reasons.
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:54:04
oh great! I don't really use just one, I like to keep my coins in different wallets just so I don't lose everything in just one go.
@_date: 2019-07-14 19:42:57
Yes, and password. You have your own seed as well. UI looks great as well. Greenwallet if you like better control of fees and has TOR.
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:09:31
we close daily candles sir . . . I should've been clearer.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:49:14
this ain't stopping till we get a new ATH. expect some pullback along the way though but ultimately if you just HODL, it's worth buying it now.

@_date: 2019-06-26 04:05:50
Yeah I guess 10% is too much. Haven’t tried btc atm so not really sure. But I guess if it’s your only way of converting some fiat (small amounts) it ain’t so bad. Gives btc more exposure as well.
@_date: 2019-06-29 22:48:00
guys . . . don't feed the troll.

yes never, by that time you'll be buying stuff with btc anyways not with filthy fiat.

Count me in! Let’s design the hat and sell it for around 50000 sats each. This way btc will even get higher.
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:27:51
So not selling it then, but lending it. Why would you sell btc just so you can purchase something with btc? You just borrow it and return it with interests.

Convenience, among other things. Online also charge at least 2%. It really depends on where you live (not everyone who trades BTC has access to coinbase you know that right?)
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:08:50
So did you sell? I hope you did cuz it's almost $9200 now
