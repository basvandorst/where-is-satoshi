...or rather: we can still use them, but maybe not for long?

NSA respecting anyone's desire to stay anonymous? haha, good one.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:35:53
wait, they are storing passwords in cleartext?

if he was Hal Finney... he was speaking to himself here?

crypt seems to generic though... needs something more unique, I think.

will you pay the tattoo in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:02:43


ha, those were the times..
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:34:16
I'm sorry to hear that, but I kinda feel, if you go on a page called localsomething.com, you're sort of begging to be scammed...

that's a nice fact, that.. one could probably still argue about... but it has nothing to do with it's popularity. c'mon, we all know to most it's just popular because of it's spectacular price explosion over the last year.

Well, hindsight and all. He was just as likely gonna loose everything, so he at least got a car out of it.

most people are probably here for the quick money, but that doesn't mean that the minority of idealists is wrong. it can be both, a good investment for now, and the future of money.

Hello, ladies, look at your man, now back to me, now back at your man, now back to me. Sadly, he isn’t me...
@_date: 2019-03-07 08:48:35


And the Bitcoins still missing
@_date: 2019-02-19 21:41:15
yes. don't take loans for this kind of stuff. only spend money you have and won't miss.
@_date: 2019-02-27 15:25:36
maybe, but that's fairly early in the movie so it ain't that bad.
@_date: 2019-04-08 15:48:11
imho, there's a special place in hell for people who write/mark things in books.
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:57:20
both, though originally BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:58:49
oh yea, because I too clearly remember Mr. Gox being the death of Bitcoin. No wait...
@_date: 2019-01-06 00:53:16
we do have dirt here too, you know.. :D
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:07:03
well sure, 20k are 20k, for everyone. but someone who just had those 20k is still hit a lot harder than someone who has millions, and the millionaire will have it easier to make that money back... a lot easier...
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:57:14
I'm not sure you really understand what opportunity cost really is. or maybe I don't. either way, my reaction is still "meh".
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:01:38
i think "afford to lose" is actually the wrong way to look at it and already too much. I bought just as much as I was "comfortable with losing". I could *afford* more.
@_date: 2018-07-30 08:00:42
not the reason, no.. but one more step in that direction.
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:39:12
true, but you could've phrased it a bit better.
"My daughter just informed me that someone told her" is unnecessarily convulated. 
"My daughter was told" would say basically the same and would be easier to grasp at a glance :)
also, the post in no way said or implied that she knew that to be wrong. could as well have been a "hey daddy, did you know that..." conversation.
@_date: 2018-04-20 09:31:51
well, he IS right 73% of the time.
