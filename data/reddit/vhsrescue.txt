They’re free coins and I don’t plan to buy any.

Yeah it would be higher without segwit. Segwit chops a small amount of size off a transaction lowering the fee.

The white paper is the holy text of Bitcoin bro. I stopped reading right there.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:40:42
No. Trading Bitcoin (and any crypto) is very easily done once I have some on an exchange.
The service providers are not mature. The price shot up a few months ago and they got overwhelmed with new accounts. As the price keeps going up, more new accounts are made because people have a fear of missing out. I wasn't expecting 20K Bitcoin this year, nor do I think they were. 
The entire network is not mature due to the transaction times/fees of Bitcoin Core. The devs are working on Lighting Network to make transactions faster (2018 release?), and the community is pushing for service providers to update their wallets to be SegWit compatible which will speed up transaction times too. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:14:05

I understand it's premined and centralized. It sounds like their Blockchain is aiming to be more for corporate purposes.
I think Bitcoins blockchain is aiming to toward government free currency.

Just get over it. I wish I mined when I could have, bought when it was single digits but it's not worth ruining my mental state of mind. Your family will be in much more pain if you weren't there. The fact that you are all together is worth way more then BTC. Your wife and daughter would trade all the wealth that could have been to have you alive. 
Also, do look into other coins. Blockchain is a new protocol. This is not only about Bitcoin. Ripple has near instant transactions. ETH is very developer friendly.

3) when someone holds a lot of asserts, they don’t sell all at once. They don’t slowly so they get the best price for their asset

The price would be jumping around quite a bit to close at the high of the third candle and open at the 4th candle. It's weird to see.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:25:28
People have been complaining about Coinbase and GDAX having lackluster customer service for a couple years. It's always been like this since their inception.
You can try LocalBitcoins, forums or meeting someone from Craigslist. The only thing to do regarding exchanges is to wait, unfortunately. 
The ecosystem is still young, as these difficulties shouldn't exist for someone with 100K+. I'm excited to see the price when the ecosystem matures.

Do it. Research them. Dell is their partner. Verify your account with social security and other stuff (i know, its intense).
Immediatly you can instantly buy $100 of bitcoin. After a month you are more legit in the eyes of coinbase, and you will be "Level 2 Verified" bringing that instant buy limit to $1,000

To have bitcoin as a native payment method on Uber will boost its credibility and the amount of people who see it as a legit payment method. Buying an Uber gift card with bitcoin is an inconvenience and people don't see it.

I agree with you and understand how it's important to have some backlog of transactions in the mempool; so there's always a fee to incentivize miners in addition to the block reward. 
If both miner1 and miner2 are trying to generate block N, how does stealing the fee differ from competing for the block and the fee it comes with? My knowledge on mining isn't deep and I've never heard of fees being stolen

I'm in the same position. What I think would happen is I send my BCC to one wallet on the BCC chain, and my BTC is still in the original wallet on the BTC chain. 
I think every wallet will get to send coins to a different address twice. So sending 5btc brings the value of the wallet to 0 on one chain, but the value on the other chain is still original. 
How do we choose which chain we're sending to?

$1.11 is the highest I will go since it looks like there's no revenue, just a domain name and a business model.

This is a site I trust and use. You can create a new table and have friends join the table and fill it up.

My business  accepts bitcoin for tape to digital conversions :). Go to the shopping cart, begin the check out and you'll see that we accept bitcoin (through coinbase)

This is really cool and creative.
This is unclear to me: Am I paying $2.50 for one chip, or a set of chips?
