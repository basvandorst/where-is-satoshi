That doesn't sound too happy, sorry to hear that. 
Maybe you could find a place to donate a bit of your bitcoin and give a less fortunate soul a chance of a "normal" life.

I bought there several times already, all transactions went well. Never tried to sell anything on Bitpanda, though.
Overall, I feel the fees are pretty high, but the UX is good.

This! Without looking at the tutorial that OP is following, just from the screenshot it looks like a typo.
The command should probably be "npm run package-electron"
