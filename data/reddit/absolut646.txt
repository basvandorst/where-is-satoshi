I'm going to take a risk with my local BK, I'll report back after lunch.

I doubt they're assembling these devices in the back room of someones house. Even so, I have a standard single family residence in SoCal and have standard 200A 220v service to my house, that's 44KW but I doubt how long I could actually pull that kind of power before the power company and/or SWAT team shows up looking for a grow house.
3 phase 480v service is common in industrial areas and would provide more than enough power for "extended testing" before shipping.

No problems!
I bought a $10 card with the app in the parking lot of the BK on their wifi. I said I had a gift card and scrolled through the cards on my Gyft app, showed hime the BK card at the register and he typed in the code shown on my screen. No fuss about it.
  crispy, no tomato, medium size, to go. $7.07 total. 
My receipt says "Remaining Balance: $2.93" at the bottom, reflected immediately on the card in the Gyft app.
This was in Valencia, Ca

I already knew how this worked, but good info, thank you.

I wonder...
Max all credit cards, convert to BTC, file for bankruptcy and live off slowly cashing out the BTC for USD for the next 7 years?

I'm more impressed with an 800mph passenger jet.
FYI, the Boeing 737 cruises at 485-511mph.

I attempted the bitinstant transfer at about 9am, it's now after 1pm and no email. What is the normal amount of time this should take?
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:47:25
That's exactly the point was making.

Coinbase makes it easy to buy, no scripts required.

Thank You! 
I'm in Southern California, I have some friends traveling through Europe right now, currently in Spain. I have told them to message me when they find a pub that accepts Bitcoin. There is no place to buy beer with BTC around here, so I'll find some beer to buy somewhere. 
Can you imagine what the fees would have been to do this with fiat? Three currencies and two international wire transfers for a beer!
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:01:24
oh, no doubt.

Was this printed with a laser printer using toner? Inkjet ink goes to hell when it gets wet, toner will survive if the paper it's printed on does.

I don't plan on sending coins from this address for about 18 years, but duly noted.

Not at a high enough altitude it isn't.

You need a few pre-printed cards with your address QR code on it. If I'm going to tip you (and I totally would) I don't want you standing there holding your badge while I do it.
If your customer asks about the Bitcoin logo and you say "I accept tips in BTC" then you can slip in your QR code with the rest of the bill. Be sure to put something like "Tips only, please pay the bill for the food normally."
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:43:20
Perfect, that's what I thought, just wanted someone to confirm.

Cash advance from a casino and claim gambling losses?
I don't advise any action like this, just playing out the what-ifs.
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:07:30
I did the same thing for my son when he was born using a vanity address and a paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:56:20
You're onto something here.
@_date: 2013-12-20 08:14:09
Came here to say this. Happy customer here for over a year, paid with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:52:54
I know someone that missing ~40 LTC that would be your best friend.
@_date: 2013-03-30 01:55:11
This is awesome, thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:30:03
Bitcoin aspect aside, thank you for raising the type of person society needs more of. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:59:39
Would this work for Litecoins? 
@_date: 2013-03-20 06:47:51
This is no way to run a currency exchange.

As a business owner, I'm curious how you report income for tax purposes. On the value of BTC at the time of the transaction? Do you use BitPay and are therefor technically being paid in USD and everything is reported normally?
I understand if you don't answer, big brother is watching afterall, but maybe someone else can answer.
@_date: 2013-12-22 18:01:49
Use a laser printer. The toner doesn't bleed if it gets wet like inkjets do.

Google shows 1 flight per day from MNL to YVR.
Korea airlines shows a direct flight on a Boeing 777-300.
Wikipedia says the Boeing 777-300 "Typical cruise speed Mach 0.84 (560 mph, 905 km/h, 490 knots) at a cruise altitude of 35,000 ft (11,000 m)"
Manila to Vancouver is east over the pacific ocean.
The flight path crosses the subtropic jetstream and flys into the polar jetstream in the last part of the flight, but most of the path is over open ocean.
If OP's friend was on a 1-stop flight via S. Korea, they would probably fly east via the polar jetstream potentially gaining another 100mph in ground speed, but that only brings the speed up to 660, 700mph tops.
But who cares, he got Bitcoin from someone on a flight. OP's friend could have bought him a beer as easily as a Lamborghini.

I was looking at this, but I'm concerned the buy schedule won't always match up with my paycheck schedule.
