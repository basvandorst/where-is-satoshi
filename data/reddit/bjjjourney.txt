Hindsight bias.

That is a myth btw. Only parts of the card that may see any sort of wear might be the fans. Also most cards that are used for mining in large setups are intentionally underutilized and kept at a good temp in order to avoid card failures and consistency. If anything I would buy a miners card over the neckbeard that games 18 hours of the day (games are WAY more taxing than mining) and never cleaned his rig.

This guy has no idea just like 99% of this sub.

With bitcoin, yes they can. There are a bunch of wealthy persons that got in on bitcoin in the past couple years that absolutely can break down artificial walls created by the group as a whole.


They will next week after they bet the future. That is why everyone should be worried. Seeing the price shoot up so fast before probably the biggest thing to happen to bitcoin that bets on its failure should scare the absolute shit out of anyone that is holding the coin for stabilization.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:11:05
Put in a sell order for 100 bitcoins and create a wall. As price creeps closer to that wall have a group member place a buy order for 110 bitcoins slightly above the market price at the wall price. You now buy and sell to the persons in your group. Not that hard to manipulate in that way. They gain by causing a price hike which they will eventually sell and then bet the future. This causes a double dip (sell at the height and cash in on the crash).
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:02:54
Not you, the OP talking about shorting.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:54:12
I think it is, if you are holding a significant amount of BTC and not in on what is going to happen, you should be worried.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:21:46
The next dip will be the crash.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:04:32
Exactly. Been happening with other cryptos for years at this point. These manipulators are now getting the chance to double dip with selling at the top and betting on futures which they cash in on because they cause the crash. All of these HLODers are going to be holding bags in a couple weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:14:37
Which makes it even more suspicious we are seeing the price fly up. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:33:54
Bitcoin is manipulated. You don't think groups are creating walls and then buying them back in the group to generate panic/interest? This has been going on with smaller cryptos ever since I can remember. An artificial run will be created with some hype around the crypto generating interest which pulls in new bag holders. As the interest rises the original runners will sell off leaving the bag with the new investors. As it was all artificial there was nothing propping the value of the coin up. Once the bag holders realize this they begin to sell off crashing the coin completely.
This is also a tactic with penny stocks and a HUGE reason why people tell you not to get involved with them.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:30:50
They just have to break down buy walls which creates buzz. This only takes some odd million, which would be easy for a group of people to do and orchestrate. The group just buys and sells to each other, that is why the walls fall so quick. No one really loses or gains anything and creates the illusion of price inflation. These people are going to eventually sell once the futures come about but not before they short it. They are going to make an absolute fuck ton of money because they will be essentially double dipping.

Everyone on reddit is going to get caught in the bear trap, guaranteed.
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:46:32
Isn't this EXACTLY why people have never truly ever wanted to use the currency in the first place?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:46:44
Banks are backed and have insurance my dude. If bitcoin crashes or simply gets hacked/destroyed at some level everyone is fucked, you just lost all of your money with no hope of getting it back. Bitcoin doesn't really solve a problem here nor does it provide a better alternative. If it made sense it would be bought up by billionaires and millionaires, but they are not buying it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:56:08
But why? Why do we need a crypto currency? No one seems to be able to answer this question.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:57:25
It only points out a few points which don't really tell the whole story. Still the question of why someone would use bitcoin instead of our current methods is not answered. I don't really care if it is smart, decentralized, or issued by the government. Why would average Joe want to use bitcoin? Does it give him an advantage in any tangible way than what he currently does? Why does average Joe need a smart, decentralized, and non-government issued currency? Answer those questions.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:02:05
Why are you arguing about something you clearly don't understand? 


This makes it better than current methods? People also have PhDs in Celtic poetry, does that mean the Celtic poetry is better than American poetry?


Nah, I am presenting logic. You are trashing banks for charging fees and other shit but in reality a bank is extremely secure and insured.


No need to. If you are the type of person getting on this train, I am 100% not buying a ticket.


Again, you are misinformed about this entire issue. You don't know who I am or what I have done with Bitcoin. I can have the above opinions and still make money off people like you.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:13:41


Maybe. Everyone has options to do what they want with their money. Some people like savings accounts, while others like Roth IRAs and CDs. There are MANY different avenues to investing. 


Have you ever used a bank or credit union? I don't think I have ever paid a fee for any sort of money transfer, like ever.


Your money is federally insured my dude.


This is the dumbest argument I have ever heard. How many stories in this sub are about people accidentally deleting their wallet or destroying a hard drive? You don't even need to get robbed to lose bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:51:06
Well bitcoin isn't proven to really be anything besides speculation. In fact it got popular because of nefarious reasons and those reasons could have just gotten bigger (money laundering etc). People are not buying or wanting for it's intended purpose which means this is a giant bubble waiting to burst.
On the other side Apple shares are tied directly to the company that you are buying in to. You are owning the company with the research that the company is doing well and will do well in the near future or however long you want to own the company for. Not to mention you have entire investment research firms that rate stocks and other investments as well. Trying to compare bitcoin to securities is absolutely fucking stupid. It isn't a big game of chicken at all. In fact you hedge your portfolio with different types of investments in order to not be killed by a crash of one company. With bitcoin, that is it. There is nothing else there, it fails and all your value is gone.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:46:44
Not really. Real markets are usually backed by something in some form. Bitcoin is literally just there with no ties to anything. If it crashes, it is gone. No one is going to step in to save it or even follow up with any criminal activity that may have caused the bubble/fall to happen.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:35:32
Bitcoin isn't really a currency though. No one is seriously using bitcoin in their daily lives. Even if someone makes a purchase with bitcoin, those stores just turn around and sell it right away. They have bills to pay and bitcoin doesn't pay them.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:22:46
It got shitty but that is exactly what I am talking about. The government isn't going to let the entire world economy fail. They would probably laugh as bitcoin dropped to nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:09:49
I don't think I am the stupid one in this situation...
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:38:42
Yeah, that graphic does absolutely nothing on showing why Bitcoin will be used in the future over our current methods.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:41:06


Enron was cooked. They got a good rating based on reports that were fucked. Nothing you or I could do there. That is why diversifying is what you need to do. You can't do that with bitcoin. It is all or nothing and in fact bitcoin isn't even an investment.


I think it is the other way around here. Bitcoin is booming simply based on speculation. There is nothing showing that the value of this crypto currency should be worth $9700 at all.


No they aren't. 


It is. This is 100% classic case of a bubble. Believing that it isn't a bubble just means you will be holding a bag of bullshit while the ones that caused the thing to collapse will be laughing to the bank with your money.


I do already. It is called a bank with a debit/credit card. I never said stocks were solid at all actually. Was just trying to point out investments without any sort of backing or regulation is completely stupid.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:45:22
Yeah you need to shop around. Took me 2 seconds to find the fees for a major money transfer company that allows free transfers from bank accounts. I am also sure that your local banks would have a better program than those services.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:49:57
Yeah, that really isn't an answer to anything I just mentioned. What you are saying is that it is all speculation. What makes bitcoin the currency that people are going to adopt and use?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:43:32
They are delirious to think that bitcoin is untouchable from anything besides themselves. These are the same types of people that think silver or gold will be valuable if the apocalypse happens.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:20:30
I looked at transfers from Germany to India. Has nothing to do with where I am currently at.


Which you still would once the bitcoin is cashed out in the local currency. It isn't like the exchange rate just goes away because you used bitcoin for the actual transfer.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:37:56
The only reason some place will accept bitcoin is purely to take advantage of the people that are gaining from it. Those stores just turn around and sell it right away. So it isn't really being adopted at all. Those stores can't pay their bills with bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:47:58
People keep saying that but what is being built?
