From the how it works section of their website. So while this does appear to be an easier method, currently it can only be used about ten times assuming a max purchase. It basically just became much easier if you are American and only need $50 in your life. Admirable move from coinbase, but regulation continues to make this a slow process.

According to the block explorers 
Only 41 blocks in total have been mined since the fork. The rate has been increasing recently but it looks like 2-3 blocks are being mined per hour. Not sure what the exact timing was but say Bittrex opened up deposits at block 478596, then expect that trades will start happening in roughly 8 hours which would be 0-1 UTC (~~ 9PM EST)

Yah its really hard to give an ELI5 for this. Basically the idea behind Bitcoin is that instead of having a database in one location that only one person can edit we give everyone a copy of the database and we let anyone edit it. The only caveat is that in order to edit this database you have to spend money in the real world. This deters abuse because abuse and cost are directly correlated.
Actually exchanging money would be complicated so instead there is sort of an indirect method (mining) where you prove that your computer used (X) kW/h of electricity. There is no way of faking this method and everyone else can check for themselves that you did what you said.
Horribly incomplete explanation, but that's the general idea behind it.

As a fellow entrepreneur I appreciate what y'all are doing. The hard thing about producing Bitcoin content is it seems like there are the people who are technical experts and then there is everyone else.
It's hard to target the people who may be interested in bitcoin but don't know much about it. This is a good article for people who aren't familiar with dollar cost averaging.
My personal opinion is that at this early stage in the game it should really be more about do you understand and believe in the technology or do you not. If volatility is enough to scare you off then A) you don't believe in it or B) you should probably focus your effort in learning more about it.
This is good investment advice in general though

You can look at it however you want, but in my opinion if you are investing in Bitcoin for the sole purpose of making money then you are just a trader and the fundamentals don't matter to you. In that case who cares about Segwit/UASF/Scaling etc... You should just try and time your entry and exit points according to your own strategy for maximizing profit.
If the fundamentals do matter to you then you view Bitcoin as a good example of what Taleb would call "antifragile". Out of all the black swan events that could possibly happen very few of those events would result in the underlying technology/network of Bitcoin suddenly having no value.
In the case of a geo politics though, it seems like there are potentially lots of black swan events that would be very positive for the value of Bitcoin. A lot of the world right now is functioning only because everything is just right. Randomness (events we can't foresee) generally makes Bitcoin stronger (antifragile) and that wont change if the price is $20, $1400, or $10,000.

That is an interesting thread thanks for linking. I think some of it is of f the mark though because the point is really just to reduce bitcoins utility as money and nothing you cherry picked really addresses that.
1. That is exactly the point, they just buy everything offered on the market. Price does not matter to any entity that has the power to print money. If the Fed were trying to corner the market a substantial price increase would actually help them (people would be pulling money out of cold storage to sell at crazy high price)
2. The only reason someone could corner the market is because the supply is fixed. Bitcoins being divisible to the 8th digit doesn't solve this problem. If Bitcoins were infinitely divisible then that would solve this problem, but being divisble by 8 doesn't solve it.
3. It doesn't matter if a bitcoin is lost or in cold storage that would actually help the person cornering the market because the point is to make it illiquid

I used to play about 80hrs a week of poker back when Pokerstars and Full Tilt were still running.

If you have a good plan for those you'll be ok.

Why? Same reason insider trading happens, same reason LIBOR happens, same reason Deutsche Bank rigs the COMEX. The ability to influence a market price in the direction you want is extremely lucrative. 
I agree though, it would take a long time and, it would only be possible after all BTC has been mined, so 2140. That is 124 years from now, or 45,260 days. To buy all bitcoin is 463BTC per day. The thing is though, you don't need to own 100% of all bitcoins, just enough to be able to influence the price of it.

@_date: 2017-07-27 04:02:22
No you are correct. The way I think of it is that the value of Bitcoin is directly correlated to the combined hashing power that is securing the network. This isn't strictly true, I just find it a useful way to think about it. 
Increasing hash power increases the value of bitcoin. If you are creating a fork and nothing else then you are just splitting up hash power. You now have two coins called different things and its a little more confusing for everyone to understand but you haven't just created double value. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:59:49
Its a cool idea but you might run into some trouble because there aren't a ton of different sources for crypto right now. As someone who tries to keep up with this stuff daily finding trending news articles and getting market sentiment aren't really pain points for me. Its pretty easy to find most of that on this sub.
Same thing goes for top people to follow. After hanging out in this sub for about a week you pretty much run into everyone and twitter aggregates that stuff sufficiently well for me right now.
For me whats missing is long form detailed content that really dives into things. Trying to do a deep dive and learn about some of this stuff can be very painful.

this is the hard hitting reporting we are here for
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:38:36


Let's say that when a soft fork happens there is roughly equal hashing power behind both chains. All the transactions happening on [Coin1 + restrictions] are also getting mined in [Coin1] because they are equally valid on both chains. If after a while people give up on [Coin1 + restrictions] and go back to [Coin1] then its basically back to normal as if no split had happen. This isn't true the other way around.


Chain splits, but again it isn't black and white. Bitcoin has had soft forks and hard forks in the past and it will likely have both in the future. If it is a fork that everyone agrees on and the network retains its size (in terms of hash power and nodes) then there really is no issue. Both hard and soft forks can turn into chain splits if they don't get a large backing, but that isn't an inherent trait of hard or soft forks. 
"Soft Fork" and "Hard Fork" are are technical terms that are used to describe the way upgrades to the Bitcoin code base are implemented.  "Chainsplit" describes an outcome that results from certain humans making certain choices.
@_date: 2016-05-12 20:46:15
This is what I was getting at. The entire point of bitcoin is distributed consensus i.e. what you do on your node effectively doesn't matter. The only way your node would matter significantly is if it was controlling a large % of the computing power in which case you would become the 51% attacker.
If one person could write software on one node that could significantly impact the structure of the block chain then the 51% attack would be the least of worries.

If bitcoin can be divisible by more then 8 decimal places into infinite decimal places then that answers the question I had so thank you.
Nothing would stop us from using another new bitcoin very true. It comes down to a question of motive. A "Money" is valuable at least in part because a lot of people are using it (i.e. Mass Adoption = value). A very public crash of bitcoin might not be valuable from a $ perspective for someone but it would be valuable if they were trying to erode trust in the tech itself.
Side notes:
- The Fed has printed $4.5 Trillion since 2008. Is the dollar now worth nothing? Would $4T be enough to buy all bitcoins?
- if you are a trying to make a market illiquid then there is no difference between regular bitcoins and cold storage bitcoins, as you just pointed out, cold storage is just as liquid.
@_date: 2016-05-12 19:50:51
I think time is an important factor. If someone wanted to corner bitcoin this week, as you pointed out, that would be pretty much impossible. If someone wanted to corner it over a longer period though that is a different story. Bitcoin is transparent in some ways (every transaction is public), but is very secretive in other ways (public keys are not tied to personal info and infinite keys can be created).
Someone that wanted to corner Bitcoin could do it using lots of public keys and transactions over a long period of time. They could even cover their tracks by trading funds between their own accounts to give the appearance of liquidity

I am just now becoming fascinated with bitcoin so I apologize if this is a topic that has been discussed frequently. My basic assumption is that if bitcoin becomes highly adopted/affective there will be entities that would seek to attack/diminish bitcoins function in the global economy. 
For the sake of argument assume the network security is 100% safe. One way to "attack" bitcoin would be to simply accumulate every bitcoin and sit on them. This effectively ends the market for bitcoin because there are no longer any bitcoin sellers. This would not be possible while coinbase transactions still exist because new money is entering the supply, but eventually the supply will be fixed at which point someone (possible who has the power to create large infinite sums of money) could attempt to do this.

Quick estimation of just the last 4 blocks shows average transaction fees mined are around 0.78 BTC = $2,000. The highest fees collected in that 4 block period was 1.35BTC. If you were mining 10 blocks a day that comes out to about $140,000 a week or $560,000 a month.
In that example if ignoring transactions caused you to mine 1 extra block a day (10% more efficient) then it would make sense. Seems like it would be something pretty easy to figure out for yourself just mine empty blocks one day and then mine full blocks the next and see which one is more profitable.

PoW is cancer and miners have no stake in the eco-system? I mean say what you want about Jihan and ASIC boost and its cool if you are against all of that, but saying miners have no stake in the eco-system is just not true. 
All of their revenue is derived from the eco-system they allegedly don't care about. They also help secure the system with massive hardware investment. If the value of that eco-system were to drop to 0 their revenues would follow in lock step. PoW was what enabled the first viable decentralized consensus system to exist. Calling that a "cancer" and stating miners have no stake in the eco-system is greatly mischaracterizing the facts.

Basically one of the key factors attracting people to Bitcoin is the fact that it is decentralized and no one person or central authority can control or manipulate it. 
Janet Yellen is the chairman/woman of the Federal Reserve so she is basically the face of central control and manipulation of money which besides being one of the most powerful institutions in the world is also pretty much the opposite of everything that Bitcoiners stand for.
A lot of people pay attention to these so it is basically a big middle finger to the "man" on national tv.

I'm not saying the Bitcoin market cap is a bad approximation, I think it is a good approximation. All I'm saying is that it's important to know that it is an approximation. For example Satoshi supposedly owns around 1,000,000 bitcoin which have never been spent. Does this mean they never will? Hard to say. If your application required a really close approximation of the market cap for w/e reason you could scan for all the UTXO that hasn't been spent in the last t years i.e. if a UTXO hasn't been spent in 4 years we now consider it "lost".
Again that would only be an approximation as you don't know if UTXO is actually lost or if the owner is simply just a long term holder. Thats why I think mined bitcoin is a good enough approximation for calculating the market cap in most cases.

As u/zomgitsduke pointed out there is no such thing as a bitcoin price = x equation for calculating what the true price of bitcoin is. The price is a reflection of ever changing market forces.
Market cap however, can be calculated. The equation for a coins market cap is basically
    # of coins in existence * price of 1 coin = market cap
For Bitcoin market cap is a somewhat useful metric as mined BTC is roughly = BTC in circulation. This isn't really true because a lot of BTC has been lost or burned but its not a bad approximation.
Market cap is calculated the same way with other alt coins but it is a much less relevant metric in some instances as a lot of alt coins have only a small % of total coins in circulation.

Exchanges don't necessarily maintain a wallet for every customer. Its more like you send the bitcoin to the exchange and then the exchange "credits" your account with that amount of bitcoin.

I'll leave out whether or not profitable trading is possible as most people on here are just going to say HODL.
If this is your goal I would recommend trading on an exchange that deals exclusively in crypto (this will vary depending on where you are located). For example BitMEX has Bitcoin swaps and futures contracts which will actually pay you out more Bitcoin if you make a profitable trade i.e. you can go long in Bitcoin and earn more Bitcoin.
Trading profitably is an entirely different animal, but those are the places that I would look if its something you are serious about.
Another option would be to find a service that will pay you interest for lending out your bitcoin and that interest is paid in bitcoin. This is probably the safest way of doing it as your bitcoin return is guaranteed (kind of), but your fiat value is not but if you don't care about short term fiat value then its not a problem. I know people that earn 0.1-0.2% daily doing this.
**Edit:** Those contracts are actually inverse futures contracts and have weird quirks associated with them. If your goal is solely to increase your BTC balance then I recommend only shorting those contracts. To fully understand why watch the first 10 minutes of this video

All of his arguments are made with the underlying assumption that the tech "just works and will continue to work". If you have business people making business arguments and tech people making tech counter arguments they just aren't going to agree.
He says that he wants "every person on the planet to be using it", but what he really means is what he himself says in this same interview "everyone using it with bigger blocks." The only difference in these two statements is where the profit goes.

There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. If there is a chain split there will be 21 million bitcoin and there will be X amount of some other alt coin that goes by some other name that has its own chain and is incompatible with bitcoin.


Yes there are two separate mining operations. There are two completely different coins each having their own rules and each requiring their own mining operation.


The value of Bitcoin is not halving because nothing is actually happening to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is remaining the same and another "XYZ Coin" with a different name, different rules, and a different network (users and miners) is being created. The only thing linking this new "XYZ Coin" to Bitcoin is that instead of starting from scratch "XYZ Coin" decided to say, lets start from Bitcoin block

I think the fact that Bitcoin is currently used as a currency points to the fact that there is a large demand in the world for online cash transactions, which are impossible without bitcoin.
Without bitcoin all financial transactions on the internet are essentially credit transactions i.e. they are promise or IOU based. Without bitcoin you aren't sending money over the internet, but rather you are sending signed instructions to a middleman who will hopefully execute the transaction on your behalf at some later time on a closed private system. In order for that system to work you have to accept fees, delays, and you have to hand over your assets to the third party before you can transact.
It is easy to see how some would look at the risks of volatility vs. the risks associated with giving up custodial control of their assets and come to the conclusion that volatility risk, + increased ease of use, is the safer route (especially when most of the volatility is in the upward direction).

@_date: 2017-07-27 12:02:32
No one ever knows what is going to happen to price but being a BTC user and being an altcoin user are not mutually exclusive, it's possible to be both. A new altcoin being created, generally, doesn't affect how many bitcoin users there are or how much hash power is securing the network. In this particular instance it might affect hash power somewhat but creating a new coin on its own doesn't just split the users in half.

There are currently no places that I know of with liquid markets for trading call/put options on bitcoin.
LedgerX was recently approved for swaps but not as a Clearinghouse to trade derivatives. 
If there was a place where you could sell put options on bitcoin I would have long ago mortgaged my house to do just that, but unfortunately no such place exists that I know of. I think most people here would be jumping at the chance to get paid for writing a contract that let them buy bitcoin at a lower price.
The only really liquid derivatives in crtypo that I know about are the quarterly futures contracts on OKCoin and BitMEX.

Here is a diagram of what happens to your "coins" in a fork










If you owned a **Coin(1)** before the fork you would now own a coin in two different chains, however these chains now have completely different rules so spending on one chain will not affect it in another chain. If you wan't to spend Coin(1) in the Coin(2) chain you have to use the Coin(2) rules which the Coin(1) chain doesn't recognize.

Well obviously the higher your transaction fee the faster your transaction is likely to be confirmed. So I would target the longest possible time you are comfortable with. If it's just a wallet you are going to do one or two transfers with and mostly HODL you don't need your transactions to confirm very fast at all. Only you know what time you are comfortable with.

Not really making sense, but you could possibly use bitpay for that? If you are setting up your own logic you could just put a static receiving address on your site that went to a wallet that you controlled and then you could implement all of the necessary logic on the backend.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:47:19
Its not a fee. The miner fee is the thing right below what you circled that says "Miner Fee" : 0.00044286
Bitcoin does not function quite like you probably expect it to. If you have a UTXO worth 0.588298 then ALL of that money must be consumed in the transaction. If you want to spend an amount that is less than 0.588298 then the leftover is sent to yourself. 
In this case it looks like you used a 0.588298 UTXO to send 0.4607658 BTC to your exchange account and you paid 0.00044286 BTC worth of fees.
input = 
- 0.588298 BTC
outputs =
- 0.4607658 BTC (your exchange wallet)
- 0.12708934 BTC (change you sent back to your Trezor)
- 0.00044286 BTC (transaction fees)
Transaction Summary
    0.4607658 (exchange money) + 0.12708934 (change paid to yourself) + 0.00044286 (fees) = 0.588298 (original input UTXO)

1. These are the same thing, it is an altcoin which is a fork of BTC.
2. This is up to semantics which many of us on here are guilty of being vague about. On here when you hear people discussing chain splits they are typically talking about a proposed rule change that has roughly 50/50 support i.e. half of the people will go left and half will go right. Typically a hardfork is the same thing as a split except the implication is that pretty much everyone is agreeing to go left if that makes sense.
3. The people behind BCC are in complete control of the situation. We wont know what they are going to do until they do it. Safest move is to plan on it happening.
4. Same as 3. There has been a lot of talk but we wont know until we know. Again safest move is to plan on it happening.
5. Here is a shitty diagram of what could theoretically happen if BCC happens on Aug 1
[BTC] -- [BTC] -- [BTC] -- | (Aug 1) | -- [BTC] -- [BTC]
............................................| -- [BCC] -- [BCC]
If you buy before Aug 1 you will have both BTC &amp; BCC when the split occurs. If you buy after Aug 1 you will only have whichever one you bought.

7.) yes nov is when the 2x block size increase is supposed to happen and things could get interesting

Honestly I don't think you are missing anything. The only practical applications people have found for smart contracts so far is creating ICO tokens.

Nothing in that link you just posted says what you are claiming. There are only two miners on that list that made a comment (Bitfury and Bitmain) and both of those comments are pro Segwit2x as long as it is activated before Aug1 which it is.
So basically 100% of the hashpower is supporting Segwit2x per your own link which you are claiming proves people are against it

GDAX is an exchange so when you initiate a transfer on there it is basically just crediting your account on the GDAX servers, nothing has actually happened on the blockchain. Most exchanges batch withdrawals for various reasons (like security) so whenever the next batch gets processed yours should eventually show up.
Edit: when the transaction actually shows up in your electrum wallet take a look at it on  you'll probably see a massive transaction which is interesting to look at and learn how exchanges do it.

I'm not trying to imply that this is my argument. Just seems like if you want to fix bitcoin by reducing hash power by &gt;90% just to get more transactions per second (Ver's argument for the BCC altcoin) there are already other alt coins that effectively do the same thing.

@_date: 2017-07-24 23:30:14
I'll answer your second question first and keep in mind these are just my own opinions


Bitcoin derives a large amount of its value and security from network effects. That is, the more people that there are using Bitcoin and running full nodes the more valuable and secure the network will be. Anything that causes the network to shrink will have a negative effect on the value/security and therefore price of Bitcoin in the long term. If a chain split occurred that caused 10% of miners to leave the Bitcoin network and instead move their hashing (computer) power towards a new network that would be negative for the long term value of Bitcoin. If a hard fork occurred and only 90% of the users went with the new chain that would have a negative affect on the long term value of the network. I know it is frustrating but there really isn't a black and white answer to this question.
What you seem to be getting at again has to do with the way those terms are typically used on r/Bitcoin. In that case I would say a chain split probably affects the value more because that term implies that a portion of the network is "splitting off" which would also imply the size of the network was decreasing. Hard forks don't necessarily carry this assumption because it is possible to do a hard fork with 100% user agreement which would not change the size of the network, but again its not black and white.

BitMEX (ill use them as an example because you did) was created by people with decades of market making experience working for huge banks like Deutsche and Citi that quit to form a freaking crypto exchange. You think they aren't trying to disrupt the industry.
BitMEX actually pays people to be market makers so their fees are actually (+) i.e. they are paying you. If you understand even one thing about how order books work you can make post only orders and get paid for every trade you make. Where else can you get that in the world? Oh yah, that would be no where.
Exchanges compete on liquidity, that is it. Technology has minimal amounts to do with that. If you had access to all of Facebook's source code could you compete with Facebook? No. Why? Because you need to get a network of over a billion users. Same issue with exchanges. How can I short sell $100 million worth of Bitcoin if no one is on the other side to buy? I can't. Has nothing to do with their developers.

You have the right idea so congrats on that. Think of your bitcoin as cash. You could keep cash in the bank or in a safety deposit box and everything would probably work out ok, but why not just keep it in your wallet or somewhere else you know is safe. That way you remove all of the risk and the responsibility is 100% in your hands.

@_date: 2017-07-28 13:04:12
No it won't affect its security in any way. Some people like to change up their receiving addresses so it makes it difficult to know how much bitcoin is associated specifically with them if one of their addresses ever becomes known in the future. In this case if someone were to hypothetically find out what your receiving address was they would be able to easily look up how much bitcoin you own. If you were using more than one receiving address this task would be more difficult to do.
It is more of an opsec/privacy decision on your part, but it wont make your paper wallet less secure.

Bitcoin is essentially traceable. The dirty bitcoin gets sent to an exchange and that bitcoin is used to buy a bunch of altcoins on that exchange. This transaction doesn't appear on any public blockchain it only appears on the books of the exchange. Therefore if you are a shady exchange and in control of the books you could theoretically wipe this data from your servers which would remove your link to the illicit bitcoin. You now have a bunch of altcoins that no one can link to any specific bitcoin UTXO. You then use these altcoins to purchase BTC back from your own exchange and this bitcoin isn't associated with any crime. You transfer the clean UTXO into your personal wallets and repeat.
If you weren't in control of an exchange you couldn't do this because the records would exist and theoretically could be subpoenaed by law enforcement.
There were rumblings that this is what BTC-e was engaged in. As I heard it they had a "shady rep" within the industry.

I don't know if this is applicable to your situation at all but I recently noticed that tons of people pre pay for their drinks at my local Starbucks. Most people simply walk in grab their drink from the little to go section and then walk out. Maybe you could implement a system like that with Bitcoin where people could pre pay and pick up there stuff when they got there?
Also maybe you could find someone locally that would agree to buy all of your BTC off of you at a pre arranged price every day/week/month? Depending on how much business you actually conduct in bitcoin you might be better off just hodling?
How many Bitcoin ATMs are there in NJ?

Right but you don't have to store your physical gold with you. If I hide my gold under a tree in the woods how is someone going to take it away from me? They are probably going to beat my legs with a lead pipe until I tell them where it is. That same method works well for finding out what peoples private keys are. You could make the "if you do it right" argument for storing gold safely as well is all I'm saying.

I'll reply to my own comment for your first question.


The answer to this one is sorta. I'll attempt another crappy diagram to explain




In a hard fork [Coin1] and [Coin2] aren't compatible. The [Coin1] chain doesn't accept any of the rules on the [Coin2] chain and visa versa. A soft fork is a little different and it looks like this.




In this situation the old chain, [Coin1], understands what is happening on the new chain [Coin1 + restrictions]. For example if there was a soft fork to decrease blocksize then it would look like this




[Coin1] would understand the new [Coin1 + restrictions] because 0.7MB fits perfectly in the rules of the old [Coin1] (0.7MB is less than the max 1MB). However, [Coin1 + restrictions] wouldn't recognize the old chain because 1MB doesn't fit inside the new restrictions. 
In this scenario old recognizes new, but new doesn't recognize old. From the [Coin1 + restrictions] perspective the old chain [Coin1] can be thought of as an "altcoin" but it isn't really an "altcoin" like you are probably thinking of it because the chains can merge back together in the future. It's a fun question to consider.

Credit and Debit cards are not cash they require trusted 3rd parties to operate. That is what I'm referencing. The desire to eliminate money transactions that do not include a 3rd party. Cashless society = 3rd party society.

There is another topic on this exact same thing like 7 posts down. 
And another post about it that was posted less than 24 hours ago 
Short answer: Exchanges batch transactions. Coinbase batches their transactions and Bittrex does as well. You need to wait until Coinbase makes the transaction on the blockchain (could take several hours or a day) and then also wait for Bittrex to process the transaction (could take several hours or a day).

Just make sure you do a little research on whatever wallet you are leaning towards. They may not all support the BCC fork if it happens. I don't use wallets on my phone so I can't tell you off the top of my head but don't take it for granted that they all give you the support you want.

If the hypothesis is that prices are going lower on FUD over Aug 1 it seems like you would see prices dropping on lower volumes as people take coins off of exchanges causing liquidity to dry up.
Taking a quick look at bitcoinity  this doesn't seem to be happening. That could mean that people aren't really fearing any Aug1 uncertainty, or it could be volume increasing as people try to take profits before getting out of the exchanges. So, like all of this, no one really knows.
You are already exposing yourself to a non zero counter party risk by having money on the exchanges in the first place. Now add in the uncertainty of a code update, the uncertainty of exchanges successfully implementing whichever update does or does not happen, and a lot of profits from the recent run up and you can see a recipe for moving a lot of money to the sidelines.

Probably the statement that high fees / full blocks increase network security.
No personal attack intended, but I would say both of your responses could have included more detail. Your response could have been made more clear if you specified what your definition of a user is. Your argument that "more users, the more value, the safer and more decentralized the network will be" is not true without caveats. Adding 100,000 users all using SPV wallets does not contribute anything to the security or decentralization of bitcoin at all. SPV nodes function by trusting a third party to supply accurate information about the current state of the blockchain and that does not help increase the security of bitcoin in any way. Just saying more users = more value is not a meaningful statement without more clarification.
In fairness could have explained his argument a little better as well. I believe the idea that higher fees and full blocks lead to increased network security is that they increase the cost of attacking the network via "spam" transactions and higher fees in theory should make mining more profitable thus incentivize more people to create mining nodes which would make bitcoin more secure and help it become more decentralized.

So we could be in a situation where most full nodes are running Core Segwit and most miners are running the btc1 implementation?
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:46:42
All of your posting today has been a great help. 
Question, if we get to step 7. what version of Segwit code is actually being run?

Yes BCC is a hard fork of BTC so if your UTXO is included in the Bitcoin chain before the fork occurs then you will have a UTXO on the Bitcoin chain and the BCC chain and you can spend both of them.
Assuming you control it in your own wallet. If you leave it on an exchange and that exchange decides not to provide support for BCC then you would only be able to withdraw Bitcoin from the exchange and not BCC.

So the block at N-1 that is mined at t = -10 is known to the network correct? So then the question is just how long does it take 2/3 of the hashing power to mine another block? How is this question any different than just saying

The good news is that people are realizing how efficient Bitcoin is. The bad news is that now normal processing times make people think exchanges are insolvent.
Ask yourself this question. Would you feel safer if your funds could be instantly transferred out of Coinbase into other wallets? People who lost money on Bitfinex know the answer. How much time would this give Coinbase to react to a security situation if they got hacked? 
Batching withdrawals is a common practice and while slightly inconvenient doesn't mean anyone is insolvent.

These statements are made under the assumption that electronic cash payments (i.e. Bitcoin) are not possible. Previously it was not possible to do an electronic cash payment but thanks to Bitcoin it is now possible.
The idea behind a cashless society is a political idea. Governments promote the idea because it implies all commerce will go through trusted third parties which are easy to control. In this hypothetical world things like negative interest rates are possible to enforce. That is why they promote it and that is why Bitcoin is not mentioned as a solution. They aren't interested in "electronic methods" that allow people to retain custodianship over their own money or that give people a way to avoid negative interest rates and bail ins.

Different blockchains/coins use different types of encryption, the type of signature algorithm you are using affects other things like how addresses are generated, then in order to participate on the network you have to be connected to other nodes, then after you are connected to nodes you need to do some kind of verification process, are you going to be a simplified payment verification node or are you going to be a fully verifying node (bitcoin example). 
Its not impossible to do what you are describing its just difficult.
