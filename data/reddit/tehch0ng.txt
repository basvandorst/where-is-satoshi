BoA probably does their own wiring, which is where my issue occurred.

The thing that irks me the most is that it's *Gemini*. They have a BitLicense *and* my name, address, SSN, D/L scan, etc.. I'll have to see if Alloya allows me to transfer to Coinbase, which I'll initiate on Tuesday.
I'm also looking at opening an account with Signature New York (which is Gemini's bank!). If that works I'll avoid wire fees altogether.

Cool, thanks for the info. I'll have to check into them. Do you have a personal or a business account?

Gemini requires a wire transfer for initial deposit or when adding a new (bank) account. They don't do the usual ACH verification, which is the microdeposits.
If it is your initial deposit into Gemini they give you $20 after confirming your deposit as a reimbursement for the wire charge.

I did, on the surface it seems great. After looking around I can't find customer reviews on the company. I can find people asking questions here on Reddit but nothing that convinces me to use them.

What bills do you have? If you have a cellphone bill in your name they'll take that. They may take a credit card bill if you don't have a cellphone bill in your name.

The ACH deposits *should* take the same amount of time to arrive but, in my experience, Coinbase takes an additional two days. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me, either, I'm just reporting my own experience.

A Trezor is really easy to use, it is a hardware (offline) wallet.

Only on the order book.

I'd suggest contacting Gemini through their email support (and explain the situation a bit). They don't accept bank statements but would probably accept a pay stub or hospital bill.

Good to know they are much faster. My Credit Union charges $20 for a domestic wire transfer but even with the fees it's cheaper for any transfers over $670. :)

Gemini has both, in my experience. They charge 0.25% on purchases. Purchases from Coinbase cost 1.49%. (Yes, GDAX has a no maker fee option. However, the average consumer would rather hit a button or two and get their coins.)
For ACH transfers, Gemini receives mine in four days. ACH transferred funds can be traded as soon as you initiate the deposit. You don't have to worry about a price increase while your funds are on the way. In contrast, Coinbase takes six days to receive ACH transfers. You also have to wait for Coinbase to actually receive your funds before purchasing.
Wire transfers in or out cost $0 at Gemini. Wire transfers from Coinbase cost $10 incoming and $25(!) outgoing. The cost of a single incoming wire to Coinbase is the fee on $4,000 bought at Gemini.

My wire transfers typically leave my account in the morning and deposit into Gemini after just a few hours.
I believe Gemini is undergoing maintenance, or is having an issue with their deposit system. I got a deposit completion email from Gemini yesterday but my account still has a hold on my funds.

In loans, so I'm loaning/selling 0.5BTC per day and earning 0.06BTC.
About your profits, it's better to think in percentage terms IMO. Making 26% weekly (or biweekly) is a ton. If you compound (reinvest) the earnings it adds up fairly quickly. $100 compounded weekly for 3 months at 26% / week is ~$2000. Even biweekly compounding results in $1500.

Similar, yes, but not as drastic. I loaned about 2 BTC during the week, but between Friday and Saturday I had one successful loan. I would think the weekend would be the biggest days.
@_date: 2016-09-14 19:42:35
I'm averaging about 0.5 BTC per day in loans. Earnings have been great at 12.25%.
When loaning money you get a "Loan Agreement" that includes the ID / photo of the borrower as a fraud deterrent measure, due to the reversible nature of PayPal transactions.
@_date: 2016-09-25 16:16:46
Money borrowed from you can't lose value. If a borrower chooses to pay you back they must return the same dollar amount.
I use both Circle and Coinbase, depending on how much BTC I need.

UPDATE: To allow for additional capture go to Summary -&gt;  Seller preferences -&gt; Block Payments
Change "For the items not sold on eBay, Only allow payments from the users with confirmed address." to Ask me.
This let's me add the 15% to customers who have not verified their identity to PayPal.
Could you guide me through how to add the additional 15% capture? I have been unable to find it. All my transactions are auto-completing and don't give me an option to add additional charges.
I did find the dispute template, it was under Seller preferences then Customer service message.
