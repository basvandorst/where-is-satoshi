We have a video we put together for the fundraising campaign that we ran a year and a bit ago that explains things: 
We're working on some updates to mediagoblin.org to give some better explainations; the last year has really been mostly focused on the software.  Check the [news though]( we give pretty good updates on the state of things there.  Hope that helps!

Cool.  Hadn't seen that one!

Hi!  So, lead MediaGoblin developer (Christopher Allan Webber) here.  Someone in the  channel on irc.freenode.net pointed me to this link.  I'm glad we're seeing a lot of enthusaism here... I think a lot of what we're doing overlaps with things the Bitcoin community care about (decentralized internet, etc).
So first of all, yes, we [accept bitcoin as donations through the FSF]( you can see, verify our bitcoin address there.  You can see our [campaign page]( for more information on what we're doing... it includes a pretty clear video, I think/hope.  (It's intentionally a bit humorously over the top.)
The post here says "we"... I'm not familiar with but they seem very enthusiastic, and enthusiasm is good... it drives our project!  But I think there's a bit of miscommunication here, so I thought I'd clear some things up:
* While we accept Bitcoin as a form of donation, we don't implement bitcoin as a protocol, or use any kind of blockchain.
* We don't have anything to do with Bitcloud... it looks like there's some posts that kind of suggest we do on (I guess we have a subreddit now!) but that's not so.
* We do aim for decentralization, and we're [working toward that using the pump api]( which is a federation protocol (think XMPP, but for social media stuff)
* It's real software, it already works.  There's a ways to go, especially on the decentralized internet front (what we're trying to get funded now!), but you can already use it to publish images/video/presentations/3d models/etc
* We don't really use any peer to peer technologies right now... I consider federation and peer to peer to be a bit of different things.  We *are* interested in having bittorrent support, maybe via [webtorrent](  That doesn't exist yet.  If you're interested in helping, let me know!
* Individual instances are responsible for their own content.
* If you're interested in private media sharing features, those don't exist yet, but we're trying to get them funded as part of our campaign... you can help!
I hope that clears up some confusion!  We are allied with the Bitcoin community in that we fight for a decentralized internet future... and that we [accept bitcoin donations]( ;)
If anyone has any other questions I'm happy to answer them!

Heya!  Good question.  Early on I chose the name because:
* the domain was available, and I liked the name.
* I knew I could draw a mascot, since I draw kind of creature-y artwork.
* there's an embedded pun in there... "gobbling up media".

Hi... lead dev here.  I think there's some confusion... though we accept bitcoin donations, MediaGoblin isn't bitcoin-like in design other than that it's decentralized (but in the sense that it supports federation).  I wrote up [some explainations in a post further on](  Hope that clears things up!

a) anyone can run an instance and b) federation, which is in progress.
Federation is another path to decentralization (think email, xmpp) though I'm hesitant to call it peer to peer.
