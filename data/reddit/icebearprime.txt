agreed. Ive said this a bunch. Remember when YAHOO was the place to start your Internet adventure? Even AOL is a relic of the past. 
Something will rise to the told. Only time will tell at this point. Somethings needs to change the world due the technology. 
Lots of potentials out there. But are any of them truly the one?

HTML has evolved. Most of the internet is actually running HTML 5  .. so you are partially wrong on that idea.
And dont forget how awful the internet would be without Javascript being layered in.

There are people that this just becomes gambling. Its as simple as that. 100% gain in a day to some is very nice. Not everyone is in this for long term changes. 
I agree with you that if people put in what they can lose, just walk away. Some people are not built like that. Its just how it is

Once Best Buy and Target start carrying 'Bitcoin' items (more likely hardware wallets) that will be a big signal for me that its critical mass. Not sure which way that really means it will go.
In addition, mainstream media will need to pump up more stories of Bitcoin Millionaires. That will be another solid sign of momentum.
I have seen these types of stories in mainstream yet (I dont consider crypto sites to be mainstream, and the Winklevoss billions, was mainstream, but is also a super outlier)

If the studies are right that 100-1000 people control 40% of BitCoin, and some of those have bee financial institutions (maybe the run up last week accumulating) - then if one of these market makers wants to swing the price to bet on or against the futures market, they could in theory do this.
Do I understand futures, not really - this is just some spew from other posts I have read .. Take it as you will

and therein lies the issue with TA ... oh do I wish it were a science versus and art
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:18:48
dont you want people to sell if you want to grab at 10K?
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:45:28
digital currency is not something new. The concept has been around since the internet. You can even say credit was a pre-cursor. What is different? Its been implemented .. what makes it strong ... ADOPTION

I never said it would get you .02 BTC .. I said it would get you .13. But thank you for confirming my math.

If you are buying small amounts then buying as you have cash is correct. Its the concept of drip investing, where you think it will long term always end higher. 
Waiting for the dips is good, and you will get better prices, but it takes time and patience. You may not time it right, and it just gets away from you.

Lets pick a technology then, LASER DISCS were supposed to be the absolute end all be all ... look where those are now. They were quicly replaced.
Anyone that doesnt think a technology can be dethrowned has their head up their ass. Shit dude, I would love to see Bitcoin run to 100K, I'm just trying to be realistic here 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:40:55
I agree that the next AMZN or GOOG will arise from this era we are in. Its just figuring out who is the trick
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:21:49
Googel trends is showin an uptick over the past 90 days. Mind sharing your graph parameters?
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:16:50
The example does illustrate how the two are loosely coupled, but its so hypothetical that it isnt exactly valid. The movement down to $1 would need to be a buy/sell ladder down to that price involving people taking money off the table (market cap).

Thanks for the info  .... still trying to navigate the FUD. next week will be an new frontier for this tech!

Come on mamma .. poppa wants another sale!

Depends how sharp it is doesnt it? And arent we all playing with what we can lose? To me thats a butter knife ... 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:56:56
I can get behind this future except the crazy citadels and hiding of wealth. I cant image Bitcoin can make more wealth, so people needing to hide because of the shift doesnt make sense.

OK, Im missing a piece of the puzzle. Sorry if I overlooked it.
You have the device and can access it with the apple id, the wallet is installed, and you have the original public key.
What part of the equation are you missing (or Im leaving out) that lets you gain access to your funds?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:19:15
Dont you want people to sell to cross 10K for your buy-in?
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:04:29
quietgentleman -- where are you watching the volume numbers. The insight is super appreciated here 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:28:42
except as a currency it has too much volatility. You buy something today, and tomorrow it just cost you 2x as much. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:22:49
yes, but exchanges without feed FTW
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:20:05
people have come up with these ideas even earlier. Its about the execution and adoption. Im sure you have had dozens ideas that came to fruition in some form years after the fact and you were like 'Man I totally thought about that'.
Its about the execution
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:44:35
Dont let people on here fool you that Market Cap means nothing. Market Cap going down like this means a significant amount of money has just left the table. 
I will agree that Market Cap in an economic dynamic isn;t the same as Stock Market Cap, but it does mean something. People just repeat what they've read here without thinking it through
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:20:01
Yes, my play on words did not work as well as I would have liked. Thank you for the clarification .. I do wish your original comment and math was there :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:20:15
This guy is a youtube genius .. 510K followers, he has like 6 ads on this .. he is making a little bit of coin on this. It sucks for him on the drop

Im from the future, so I know -- Dec 312t into Jan 1st will got into the 12.5s and then come back up into the 15's the first week of January.
The future is bright

I know this sounds ridiculous, but it has worked for me recovering passwords. It may simply be how my brain is wired.
Relax, keep the phone if front of you, and picture yourself typing the password. Think about a muscle memory that you used to type it. You need to relax and concentrate. 
If that doesnt work. Close you eyes and do the same thing. 
I had luck and failure with this. Never going back 2 years. Maybe 2 months. Give it a shot. Remember to be relaxed and dont stress about the outcome either way
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:36:17
this doesnt make sense to me. Everywhere else I have read you dont actually get a BitCoin at the end of contract term.
Also, if you think its gonna go up, why not just buy the thing out right?
I was under the impression that this is more for hedging. Say miners want to limit their risk that what they mine doesnt go down. They buy the futures contract to sell at a higher price. 
If what they mine goes down they sell the real one for the loss but equilize with the contract.
Im doing a shitastic explanation, because I dont understand this at all .. .but here is a video 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:43:11
1800% since 1980 isnt that crazy. Look at AMZN or MA over the past 10-15 years

That was a play on the saying 'Just my .02 Cents' as  referenced ...

whats sort of a PITA with Bitcoin TA is that across all the different exchanges, there is no uniformity. Last night alone Binance and GDAX were at one point at a $2K difference

you do realize that China holds a lot of the US debt and can use it in very offensive ways?
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:39:47
the 100 billion is people taking money off the table as the price falls. The price doesnt fall without the transfer of ownership and that comes at a price of rise or fall. In this case, the price fell as those that sold took money off the table
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:55:36
This is not investing. This is as speculative as it gets.

you'll need to transfer it to a digital wallet and then send it to the exchange

 or is the draw the speculative growth BC has over gold? If Gold was possibly growing at the same rate, would you not be more inclined? I dont think its a probably all things equal arguement
