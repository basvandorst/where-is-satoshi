So howdo I get my B2X whenhaving my legacy coins on a nano?
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:40:55
so how do i run a node? newbie times 10here
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:19:20
what would be a good exchange for that?
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:27:10
Hi 
Thanks for the information. I will try to set it up.. Thanks a lot. Just to make sure I understand: A node just helps securing the network right? It is not doing any good for my purse right? Just to not tell anyone stuff I don't know anything about.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:29:30
awesome. I'll dive into it and start running one. thanks
@_date: 2018-11-07 14:56:10
Haha fantastic. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 18:20:39
thanks. yeah, I know. I just thought I take the 20 bucks I get from forks to buy some good stuff for cheap. but maybe it isn't worth the risk. I'll check out the two wallets you mentioned though. thx

Same here. And i am sure theythought about preventing this from happening... I am just thinking out loud here
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:56:25
I guess that is somehow the idea aka sidechain...
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:22:17
But so this puts then a ton of tx on the main chain, no? Only time delayed as thex went through but werent actually confirmed yet. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:31:56
But couldnt then B send it to E instead, send a fraudulent key from E to A? Because A and in this case fake C never directly correspond.

How is the bitcoin secured in that cloud and how does the blockchain (the base) know the current state of the blockchain when so many people have btc in the cloud and spend it and might not bring same amount back tp base like they put in ln? 
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:55:47
Thanks. Interesting. So the cloud is a bad analogy. Its more a wallet that can hold funds which enable the wallet to be used to make transactions through. But what if lets say a node that is involved in some unverified transactions accidentally goes offline? What if e.g. bob pays dave through alice's node. alice goes offline while she paid to dave but didnt receive bobs money yet . would her going offline just keep the transaction pendant and what would happen to the core chain? Cuz it can't be updated and create final tx of each wallet involved as long as the transaction still isnt finished. 
Also, what if this happens with several tx simultaniously? I guess my main point is: how does this not get messy and how cam be ensured everything stays in order, when txs go thrpugh but arent yet stored on btc's main chain? 
I hope i make sense... :)
