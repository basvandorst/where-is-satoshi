I'm not being negative to her or him. I'm negative to the reactions in this thread from other people encouraging those who feel they personally have little funds, to speculate.
I said gifts are nice. Her sentiment is great. BUT this is the point I was conveying in my first post:

You're quite poor and speculating on a volatile investment?
This sub is full of assholes or morons considering the top posts are encouraging this.
And am I reading that right? You have 30.29 in total value, so you're getting slammed on fees?

I'm still not getting it then. And sorry, I'm pretty hungover. Please show me where my confusion is:
1. You're both "quite poor"
1. you've wanted to do this for some time, but it wasn't affordable. Your wife got this as a gift for you (which is nice. Gifts are nice. I'm not shitting on gifts)
1. She's been purchasing it over time, totalling a current value of 30.29. So she is paying a transaction fee on multiple transactions that eventually add up to 30.29 in value. 
1. This is an investment for you. Which means you bought it to make money.
If all of that is true I'd like to better understand how much was paid to get to a total present value of $30.29 and what the money was competing with. It's great that she bought you a gift but if this is all correct NO ONE should be encouraging people who are "quite poor" to speculate. That's fucking insane.
**EDIT** OP: I think the sentiment and gift is lovely. I hope it does really well for you guys. You aren't the person my first post was criticizing, and I hope that came through.
My post was that people should not encourage others to invest (in anything, really) if funds are tight and anyone doing so strikes me as a POS trying to increase demand in a product they've already invested in. Encouraging you and others to take risks so they can profit.

I thought this about THQ.

You should just ban people from selling bitcoins below market rate. That will solve your problem altogether.
