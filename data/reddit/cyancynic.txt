Do you like being threatened with extortion of your personal data in order to buy products at their proper price?  


So…loyalty cards are for suckers.  Yes, you need them at many grocery stores in order to not be ripped off.  I get a new loyalty card a month and I fill out the form with fake data from my local grocer.
I also resent the constant attempt to fatten my wallet and keychain with stupid plastic tags and cards.
Most people that do a bit of thinking and care about their privacy are the same.
I would not use a system that tied my banking info to a loyalty card system.

So how exactly does a bitcoin purchase work at a checkout counter?  I’m confused.  I can see how to send and receive coins from the Bitcoin app on my computer, but when I’m out and about…how does this work?

I should clarify - I do not nor have I ever worked for Apple. I think it will be free, part of passbook/keychain probably.
It's just a guess, but based on previous history I think that's why they aren't approving those apps - they think it should be an os API.
And yes, it will be free.
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:22:40
Seriously how many apps do you have shipped out because I have like three or four with a couple more in the pipeline and it's a cesspool

Most consumers do not like loyalty programs.  Keeping that stuff separate from my payment mechanism is a feature, not a problem.
The “number of steps to pay” criticism is very valid.

Jesus holy fuck you chicken littles know fuck all about how Apple thinks. Yes go burn your iPhones and get one of those malware infested androids. That'll show em.
Historically Apple listens to their customers. They don't speak. But they go off and think "what is the right way to do this?" A year goes by and in the next major release they acknowledge the unmet desire, they then announce their take on it and they then ship something one generation cooler than what you asked for. It does that and anticipates the next five things you wanted.
I suspect Apple is going to bake cryptocoin handling into iOS at a deep and ubiquitous level and will provide iCloud based wallet sync to boot. It will probably be wonderful, work with passbook and safari etc.
And just as they've done in the past, they will ban any app that conflicts with what they are planning. It is possible they've identified a security issue in these wallet apps and concluded the right fix is doing crypto coins right and they don't want to risk the bad press if one of these wallets turns out to be vulnerable.
That's my guess as a very long term Apple developer. It's not arrogance or greed. It's concern for reputation and to some extent it's sending a signal - don't do bitcoin apps - we are gonna do it our way and obsolete your stuff.
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:27:54

From [another post I made](
iOS is fine. It has good sandboxing. It is not possible for an application to bring itself to the foreground. It is not possible for an application to monitor the screen when it is not in the foreground. It is not possible for an application to snoop on network traffic of other applications.
These statements are NOT TRUE on Android. It is possible for a trojan application to monitor screen touches from the background. It is possible for an application to bring itself to the foreground. It is possible for malware to arrange for code to be injected into other applications. So maybe you downloaded a cool app that is a fun game or something. But maybe it also scans your device for banking apps and when it notices you launching one it brings itself to the front with a user interface that looks just like your banking app. You enter your credentials and the app sends them over the wire and you get cleaned out. Cool huh? There are many other exploits available in the Android device that Apple’s devices don’t have because iOS was designed with “horrible limitations” like no unlimited background processing.
Limitations are good. Android universe is a malware cesspool. I would not trust one with anything I wouldn’t put on a public website. iOS is not perfect, but the problems have been mostly limited to Safari bugs. Apps are much more secure. Apple’s review process does a fair job of keeping the bad malware out as well.
Android is the Windows 3 of smart phones.
[Over 1300 new malware apps targeting Anrdoid last year](
[Android Svpeng now capable of phishing](


Because Android apps can be notified of launches and they can bring themselves to the front.  iOS apps can’t.  Android is a big fat juicy target.
There’s lots more out there.

Android does allow competition - and Apple’s browser still kicks its ass.

They use biometric verification.  Yes I know [it can be hacked]( (and the ones on Android phones are [no better](  But [not efficiently at scale](
OTOH, there is this nifty data structure called a block chain that can be analyzed globally for transaction patterns.  That, I find a bit more disturbing.

So, having been shown that housing them is cheaper - you decide money doesn't matter and take a pseudo-moral position?  Do you want to save money or not?
Apart from that, your argument is bullshit.  People can already get a tent and live under a bridge if they are inclined that way.  So why don't they?  "Why work when you can just panhandle and get high by the river?"  That's where your argument leads.  But most people don't take that path.
Most people are not happy with crumbs.  Nobody who can work just decides to give it up because they're not gonna starve.  Most people want more.  This has been shown in the [basic income experiments](  Despite having basic income, the recipients still pursued vocations.
It also glosses over the reality of the people who are homeless.  A lot of them are simply not equipped to work. They aren't wired to.  Many of them are mentally ill (and were put on the street by Reagan) and should be institutionalized.  That we don't take care of them as a society is barbaric and shameful.  The "personal responsibility" argument is crap.
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:51:58
For drug use? Out of sight arrest is much less likely.
This has been tried and the results were incredibly successful. Give em a place and subsistence allowance and it’s much cheaper than what we have now.
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:44:00
Not even close.
A proper "charity" provides a hand up, which has benefits to society over all and ultimately leads the recipient not just to self-sufficiency but to success such that he becomes the next donor-class.
House the homeless to save a buck.
Los Angeles spends over $100k per homeless person each year "processing" them in and out of jail.  You could rent them an apartment for about $12k/yr.  That's real profit.
@_date: 2015-09-21 11:03:17
You are missing the point.  I don't need electricity to spend them or trade them.

Having trouble finding that exact figure and can't recall where I first heard/saw it - maybe local radio - but it stuck.  The number isn't really that far fetched when you consider it includes the cost of police time, court time, ER visits, etc.   
Doing a quick search this morning there is more than ample evidence to show that it is cheaper to house them than ignore them.
Most articles I do find cite these two Rand studies:  and 
And I found this stating that its more like $40k so maybe I misremembered. 
So, yeah, you're probably right - the $100k number is probably overstated.  However, the point remains valid - its cheaper to house them than leave them in their campsites.
Right now, if you follow the news, Orange County CA has recently forcibly emptied a large "settlement" and there is a lot of discussion about where to send them.  The judge making the calls seems determined to "solve" the homeless problem once and for all with an eye to becoming a model for the nation.

That’s not the goal. Getting back our common spaces and saving $90k a year per homeless person is the goal. I DGAF if they sit in their free apartment high off their ass 24/7 as long as we spend less money on them.

Cash only people don't borrow, they save and buy. All that shit you just described as an essential part of modern life has a huge cost to you and isn't generally worth it.
I know people with cash businesses - they don't have banks they have safes loaded with fat untraceable (and u taxable) stacks. Why do foreigners run cash businesses like restaurants, liquor stores and dry cleaners?

That's like saying "come with me to AA and I'll show you why prohibition needs to come back".
Only we tried prohibition and it caused more problems than the alcohol abuse it was meant to curtail.
Some people have problems with some substances.  They're in the minority.  A lot of people can use those substances responsibly and have no problem with them.
Prohibition is the problem, not the solution.
