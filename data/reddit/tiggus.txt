I see this argument a lot but it is a terrible way to try to convince someone of bitcoins value.  You are arguing that the world's strongest economy(which backs the USD) is going to completely fail.  In this scenario we will be living in underground shelters in the desert, best to stick with all the actual good arguments for it's value.

Everything is a risk, just explain the reward is greater than the risk(I'm assuming you believe this).  For me personally the risk that worries me the most is a major flaw is found in the protocol and it is exploited.  That would pretty much kill it overnight, on the plus side there's a lot of people who have been looking for one and have been unsuccessful over the last 10 years which is fairly reassuring.  I am not particularly worried about it going to 0 in other scenarios because too many people are making money off it.

care to explain?

I've been trying to explain this to a friend of mine, the best I came up with is:  
1) You fund a lightning compatible wallet with X amount of BTC(1 btc transaction) 
2)  Buy/sell things on lightning network with almost no fees and fast transaction times, btc network does not see any of this.
2) When you want to move money back to your btc wallet you can settle it on lightning network and it broadcasts another btc transaction back to your main btc wallet(1 btc transaction).  
So 1 btc transaction everytime you want to add  more funds for lightning purchases, and 1 btc transaction when you want to withdraw money.

If that happened to me and it was that clearcut I would take them to court.  Companies are not allowed to just steal your money for no reason.

This is phase 4 of the plan

Hey sounds like my annual review at work, I do the same thing

Banks exist for a reason :)

Understand that part, just wondering if the backup ledger nano(for convenience mainly if I ever need it) really needs to be updated that often for firmware etc. or if it will be good a year, 2 years from now.  I get that I can regenerate to a new one or BIP compliant wallet if needed.

I have nothing at all against those other things but when those are gone you might wish you had some btc sitting in a wallet instead.  To later blow on even more of those things if you wish.

He's just doing his job, no financial advisor is going to tell you to put a large amount of net worth in a super volatile asset, that's called gambling.

Setup a node last weekend and made around 5-6 transactions to various sites, around 1 second if I am directly connected to the peer I want to spend on or 5-10 seconds if somewhere else.  This is with LND.  Looking at my log the time is directly related to number of hops it has to go, 5 hops was my largest.

yes and they have the know how and resources, ie. nation states who do this kind of stuff all the time.  Traditional banks get hacked but there are safeguards in place for transferring lots of money out that can be reversed, failing that in the US they are FDIC insured to 250k per depositor.  One of the reasons people with serious cash liquidity(not saying this is smart) split it amongst multiple banks.

There actually was a very well written bit of research on this posted today over in the bitcoinmarkets subreddit:  [Blockchain Data]( 
It shows that the block rewards are a large percentage of the daily trading volume on the exchanges and that indeed the halvening should be a major factor in price.

Awesome, thanks.  That's what I thought but some information out there made it seem like there might issues updating firmware after a long period of time.

I think we're starting to see that, ie. Fidelity's custodial service, just not available for retail yet.  I trust Fidelity, I don't trust coinbase.

If you use a safety deposit box with a backup ledger/seeds do you need to charge it every couple months or can you just forget about it until you need it?  Seems kind of inconvenient to have to pull it out that often.

Just a word of warning if you are in the US, you'll pay taxes on those trades and have to report them, which depending on your volume might be slightly(or a lot) unpleasant.

I would agree with that assessment based on my anecdotal evidence as well(though I run with an older crowd in 30-50's range).  There was a lot of hype in the news and some folks talking about it at work but almost nobody actually owned any(including me).  I recently bought in mainly to diversify a bit but I also see the ecosystem maturing and the proposition as a store of value is pretty good.  I think as you see more big players like Fidelity etc. offering ways to hold it safely/easily it will also become more mainstream(just not for day to day transactions).

There is this thing in the US called due process.  Part of that is discovery of evidence by both sides.  I'm afraid you need to back your claim up with more than just "they are unfair".  I'm also not sure how politics would be involved in a civil case against a company over lost funds.  I've seen similar cases against PayPal in the past which were settled favorably for the seller.

Let's not get too carried away, I think he should just invest a few billion at first.

You hodl because although you "think" it could fall or rise it might not, there is plenty of evidence showing the majority of traders get rekt.  Buffet demonstrated this quite well with his passive index fund outperforming some of the best actively traded ones in the industry.  It's not like this hasn't been discussed before.  Whales moving the market is unpredictable and lends even more rationale to hodling longterm.  Also whales do not make money on holders, they make money on FOMO and panic.

I'm not sure why you posting here when you could be making millions with your "reactive trading"
