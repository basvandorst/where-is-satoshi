Those words mean something completely different then the ones you used. The words you used , would be describing them coming into my room in the middle of the night. Pointing a gun at my head and telling me to sign up for an account. Then making me fund the account. AND THEN .. making me click on some web site. 
But anyway .. I digress.

That's the base reason for the futures market. To allow the asset creator to hedge a bit of profit for a known income.You promise to sell some of your coin for what it costs to produce all of your expected coin at a fixed time in the future to ensure you don't lose money due to fluctuations in price between now and then. 
If it crashes , they don't lose anything. If it goes up , they make the profit on their excess coin.

Its also not actually 'shorting'. Shorting is to borrow something to sell today , and then buying it back at market at a future date. 
Its simply contracts. And there must be two parties for each contract. One that agrees to sell at a specific price on a set date , and one that agrees to buy at a specific price on a set date. 
Yes , it allows you to hedge against the price dropping , but it's NOT shorting. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:15:04
Wow .. you didn't actually read and understand my comment. 
In english , there are verbs ( actions ) and adverbs ( descriptors / modifiers of actions ). Short the verb is selling a borrowed item. They used the word as a verb. That does not happen in the futures market. 
The phrases "To short an asset" and "to go short on an asset" mean different things. 
Subtle , but very important difference.

Yes , it is semantics. But after all , this is a precise situation , and subtleties matter.
If we take the word "confirmations" to mean specifically "blockchain conformations" , then yes there are ways to trust and confirm that a transaction happened / will happen while there are still zero confirmations. 
Personally , I just see all of these "add-on" as removing the basic benefits of bitcoin. But thats , of course ,  just my opinion.

You are missing the point.  You should NOT be re-using addresses. Just the fact that you even thought this was a good idea shows how little you understand about the concept.

Whatever you say ... 
I have witnessed it first hand. A close friend of mine does home improvements , and occasionally has issues with clients. He had 2 bad reviews on yelp that just magically went away once he paid for a six month subscription.
Back in the late naughts , I started a company to do some side business , I earned a bad review due to miscommunication with a client ( he actually wanted X , but signed an estimate for Z ). The cost of re-doing the project was just not worth it  ( never mind the fact that this was actually the last project that company ever did ) , so the client posted a bad review ( only negative out of the 2 dozen or so reviews I had on there ). Within 3 days of it being posted , I started getting phone calls from them offing to "fix it" if I subscribed.
I will never trust yelp to be unbiased.

But you also forget that his money is MUCH cheaper now. As in , you get to keep a lot more of it. 
Spending $1000 might require you to earn 1400 to actually have $1000 in your hand. After the home , that 1000 in your hand might only require you to earn 1100 or so. Remember , all that interest you are paying ( and your monthly payment is MOSTLY interest for the first years ) is tax deductible. Which decreases the actual cost ( in time ) that you have to pay to get the resultant amount.

same type insurance .. Yes , it 'insures' that the cab is insured to the proper level.
Same model car ( this isn't an actual requirement , there are just minimum specs the car must meet as far as mpg and passenger space and It just happens that the crown vic survived VERY well in the extreme service that is a taxi ) .. Yes it allows customers to spot a taxi easier. 
same service .. Not sure what you mean by that. But the service here is "take me to the location I need to go to. Not sure what sort of deviations you would want to have from that. 
I also don't think you know what the words "government monopoly" actually means because there is nothing about the NYC taxi system that is a government monopoly.

Yes , it is. 
Think about it this way , is you need to pay a tax bill or interest of $ 1,000 all you need to do is earn $1,000. If you wanted to spend a grand on something else , you would need to earn closer to 13 or 1400 to account for having to pay tax on that money ( assuming an ~33% tax rate ) 
if you are earning 100/hr thats ten hours time to pay the tax/interest bill for 1k but to spend a grand on a new tv or something would be closer to 13 or 14 hours you would have to work to get the same $$$$$ figure in your hand.

No .. but my close fried did pay .. and it was fixed. His negative reviews were no longer counted in his "rating" and were no longer visible from his profile page. 
I was not going to pay them to fix anything. Even if it was just an overzealous sales person making claims that were not true. THEY CALLED ME .. After 2 years of having reviews on the site , just days ( I believe it may have even been the same day ) after the negative review was posted. With an offer of "buy a six month subscription , and we will fix it". Thats just shady business practice. And no , it was not a phishing attempt , the caller was not trying to get me to give him my CC info , it was just simply "go to yelp.com and click on whatever and buy a sub , and we will take care of everything from there" 
Combined with the fact that when I mentioned this to my friend , he told me that a similar thing happened to him a few months prior. He figured the worst that could happen is that he loose the $250 or whatever it cost him , so he did it.Like magic , his 3 star ratting with 6 reviews  became a 4.5 with 10 reviews. Overnight. 
I will never trust yelp. Consider that my review of them. Either listen to it , or don't.
They may not actually remove the negative reviews .. Perhaps they just downgrade them .. or put them at the end of the list .. Or whatever they do to make themselves believe that they are providing a "service" to whomever they think they are providing a service to. Either way , its not transparent or unbiased and based on my personal experience with them , I will never trust them.

Umm ... 
you can never **rely** on 0 confirmations. 
In the real money world. zero confirmations is like handing someone an envelope. Inside there may be money , or there may not be. Or there may be money , but it may be $2 and not $200. Confirmations are like opening the envelope and looking inside to see if there is actually money inside. And then each subsequent confirmation is like looking closer at the bills. Similar to how a cashier might use one of them pens on the bills. Or holding them up to the light to look for security features and whatnot. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 03:35:20
I am guessing that this is your first mortgage. 
Ok .. first off , "seller pays closing costs" is a euphemism for "closing costs are rolled into the loan". The seller still gets the number they want , and you pay X more for the home than you should have. Not always a bad thing. Just saying that its not actually the seller thats paying the costs , its you. You just don't understand the deal well enough to know that. Technically , its termed a concession. 
If you are actually doing a deal where you bring nothing to the closing table , than the bank doesn't have to verify **any** assets. That $800 in the bank would have been enough for them to write the loan. As long as everything else works ( you have a job that pays you enough to pay the mortgage / taxes / current bills and still have a bit left over ) They don't give a shit if you have anything in the bank , because you don't have to pay anything. 
Seriously , this is just the bank saying "ummm .. whatever , we don't care" when you showed them the statements. Nothing more , nothing less. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:39:35

Bash has a much larger user base then bitcoin. And arguably there is much more of an incentive to exploit it then bitcoin ( pretty much any computer running any flavor of unix has bash ) Yet it took 25 years for someone to release it responsibly.  
And seriously , if someone is digging through the bitcoin source looking for exploitable bugs , how can you be so confident that they will be responsible in how they report / release it. 
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:44:07
See the issue I have with that sort of system ( third party , out of band ) is more of a basic level. By requiring the use of a third party , you remove a lot of the benefits of using bitcoin in the first place. Now it becomes a point where governments can impose regulations.

You completely missed the point of the story here. 
The blocked payment means nothing , the real issue is that argentina is in a 'cant win' situation. If they pay the guys that didn't take the write down , they are violating argentina law. If they don't , they are in violation of the US court order. ( I personally think that order is wrong/incorrect. The whole point of accepting a write down is to increase your chances of getting paid. Refuse to do that , and maybe you don't get paid.But this also means that argentina is in actual default to the guys that refused the writedown.  ... but thats a whole other topic ) 
A bond holder would tend to not take a bond contract , if there was no way to actually enforce that contract.  If they did , it would be at a MUCH higher rate. Simply because the risk is higher.
Its like at them "everyones approved" used car dealerships. They give you rate X% on the loan , because they install a lojack type device to aid in repossession. Without that lojack , the rate would have to be X+5 or something. 
Argentina starts doing that , and its cost to do business on every level is just going to increase.

The basic idea of properly rights is against a true free market.  It artificially reduces costs.  If you want to secure your stuff , you spend the money to secure it. With the associated cost passed along to the customer. 
Now that cost could be government regulation. 
All I said is that a market with regulation isn't actually free. Nothing more , and nothing less.
@_date: 2014-06-27 11:50:18
YES IT DOES. Thats the whole point here. the phrase "atm" is ambiguous in most of the laws. 
Some overzealous da someplace charges someone with whatever violation of whatever regulation. The first motion by the defence is likely going to be how its not an ATM. Then the DA brings up all these posts and all the discussions showing that the general public refers to them as ATM's And that they are being ADVERTISED as atm's. The famous "Looks like a duck and quacks like a duck" argument.

How would that shift risk ? The transfer happens in bitcoin. so you are getting bitcoin .. If you want USD , then you ( the receiver ) would still have to convert it to USD.

@_date: 2016-12-13 19:47:43


No , it tells you the value of the btc economy when converted into USD. Not the value of the BTC economy as a whole. 
The only thing this number tells you ( in theory ) , is how much USD it would cost you to buy every bitcoin. It tells you nothing about the bitcoin economy itself. 
Think about it this way , if you look at the market cap of BTC in BTC itself , every moment a block is mined is the peak of the market cap.

WOW .. 
But anyway. 
Mining .. math and electricty create the bitcoin. The bitcoin has properties. These properties allow it to be exchanged for other things. The fact that you can exchange that bitcoin gives it value. 
If you could not exchange a bitcoin for something else , it has no value. 
Mining and labour do not create value in a bitcoin , they create the bitcoin itself. A bitcoin in and of itself has no value. Its only value is the fact that it can be exchanged.

Absofuckinglutely not. 
You are confusing value with price. Similar but different things.
Value is its worth to you. Price is that value expressed as an amount of some tradeable resource. 
Gold has intrinsic value. Its basic physical properties. It can be molded and shaped into various objects. It conducts electricity. It can be polished to a high shine. These are the things that give gold value. 
Bitcoins value is derived from the fact that it can be traded. It has no value other than that.

Your original comment. 


Tesla does indeed make more than one pack .. ( I believe you conceded this point already ) 
Next we look at the second point. **all** car manufactures do "similar things" 
The "things" that tesla did , was to have a software lock that degrades both range and performance. 
I concede that most ( if not all ) automakers will use similar , if not identical parts across various lines. I just do not agree that using the same steering rack for all your lines is anywhere near the same 'thing' as having a software lock ( that you can pay to have removed ) that degrades range and performance. 
Next , lets look at the word "similar" for a moment. Because I believe this may be where we are having the biggest difference of opinion. 
From 




no two animal habitats are exactly similar —W. H. Dowdeswell


What tesla did with these two specific models is to have a software lock that degrades both range and performance. 
GM making 4 versions of its LS1 with various internal parts and or different induction systems does not fit the definition of similar 
GM de-tuning a 700 HP version of its LS1 for use with a 'less strong' transmission does not fit the definition of similar. 
What would be similar ( even though it doesn't degrade range )  would be requiring ( or giving the option to ) a hellcat buyer to pay an additional fee to get the red key. for reference 
GM doesn't sell a version of the hellcat without the red key. 
To side track for a bit , you compare a battery pack to a gas tank. Close , but not quite.  The size of the battery pack is the bottleneck for two major things. The range ( which makes it similar to the gas tank in that respect ) however it also determines the peak current output of the pack. A battery technology and construction method determines a batteries "C" rating. To figure out the peak current the pack can provide , you multiply the C rating by the size of the pack.  a 60kwh pack would be c X 60 as the peak , a 70 would be 70 X C.  Tesla did not software limit just the range , they also limited the peak current. The software lock causes the larger pack to perform exactly the same ( similarly to ) a physically different pack.

Because the other components in the drivetrain are not designed to support more power. 


Please enlighten me and name one. An actual significant option. Not floor mats , bumper covers or things like that. 
You can't walk into a subaru dealer and have your legacy upgraded to STI power. You have to buy an sti from the start. 
Tesla has a button they can press that transforms your 60 to a 75. Increasing both range and acceleration. It's SO simple for them to do it , that they in fact gave the upgrade **for free** to folks affected by the hurricanes recently.  I know of no other car that you can walk into the dealer post purchase and adjust anything significant with the push of a button. Never mind have it done remotely.

@_date: 2017-11-17 02:30:42

The correct term is "remanufacturer" The car gets a COMPLETELY  new vin number ( not just a few digits changed for option packages ) , it's in no way OEM. its no longer a holden. OEM is ford's SVT or subaru's STI or toyota's TRD or mercedes AMG. Walkinshaw is the same thing thats done here in the states with saleen and their mustangs.  You don't go buy a holden , give it to them , and they give you back an upgraded holden. THEY go buy a holden , and build you a walkinshaw. 


Your original statement was that tesla made a single battery pack. That's actually not true. In addition , you are now trying to compare part swaps with software unlocks. 


I agree that its legal , I can not agree that its regular.  
To get back to the original issue ( put the goal posts somewhat back where they started ) 
Please name one other car maker that  does indeed do simple software locks to create different versions. I know of no other car maker where you can walk into the dealer 2 years later and get a  'GT' version when you started with the base. Heck , I would even love to hear about one that is willing to do it even with significant part swappage.

As a generic avg end user of amazon , I would need some pretty steep discounts to make me use BTC to pay and not VISA. 
My visa gives me a small discount ( 5% ). Price protection if I find a lower price in 6 months. Extra warranty. And I don't have to actually pay for it for at least a month. Now because its amazon , I would rarely if ever have to use the reversibility features but its there.
BTC would give me a warm fuzzy feeling of course. Never mind that amazon is one of the few , if not the only , online retailer that I would even consider paying with irreversible BTC.

Normalization is structuring your data is such a way that makes it easily relatable with other normalized databases. That's about the only place that the ideas connect.

The point is that they believe that they are BTC. Why would they decide on a new ticker when they believe that its the other side that should be deciding on a new ticker ?? 
@_date: 2016-05-24 14:08:22


Its really not though. 
with a CC , it's just a promise that you ( the merchant )  will be paid. You don't have the funds available for a few days. With bitcoin , once the transaction is confirmed , you have control of the coins and can respend them.

Only card I have ever used with an actual $1 minimum was amex 
@_date: 2015-10-26 16:11:33
There is no fraud protections on pre-paid cards ? 
"I never authorized this charge" isn't enough to get them reversed ?

Let me ask you this. 
What recourse do I have , if I purchase something with btc online and the seller never ships the item .. Or the item is not as described ? Some sort of escrow service perhaps. 
Any sort of reputation system will have a 'chicken/egg' problem. 
BTC and CC cant compete , because they provide completely different services.

That would be insanely stupid of the retailer. The chargeback process is a bit different when its a CA then a purchase. the CA route protects the retailer a bit more.

Catonsville , where the device originated , is considered a suburb of Baltimore. There is nothing "circuitous" about a shipment from there going through Baltimore. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 21:41:14
If it came from Sweden , there would have been zero reason for the USPS to have touched it at all. Swiss post direct to Canada. 
Assuming thats an unaltered screenshot ( tin foil hat mode ... ) the shipment  originated in the USA from Catonsville md. Which is like 5 minutes driving from Baltimore. 
Its a pretty common practice for overseas companies expecting a large volume of business in NA to ship a  larger quantify to a location in the US in order to give cheaper shipping to the end customer. Very similar in concept to 'drop shipping'

Buy high , sell low  .... Never works. 
The situation you are describing is not "Buy high , sell low". If it "Works" then its "Buy low ( on average ) , sell high ( on average )"

No .. wallet should be "something to hold my bitcoins" That is its only required function. And thats what this piece of paper represents. It has my bitcoins on it. Using the information on that piece of paper , I can interact with my bitcoins. Its the same thing as a wallet in real life.
That other program that generates unlimited addresses is something in addition to a wallet.  
The general public has a meaning for that word already. You can't expect them to have to accept that the word wallet doesn't mean that it functions like a wallet in the real world ? 
Come on .... 
@_date: 2015-02-10 03:34:02
No ... Thats not "escrow in bitcoin" that is a technical feature that can be used by a third party service to provide escrow functionality.

Which have no actual flagg to be avoided. Lets say you deposit 15 grand in a month , but its broken down into 5 transactions. The bank may still report the transactions even though none of them are above 10k.

No .. there is NO escrow in "Bitcoin"

I can only assume that you don't actually understand the concept of normalization of data. 
Normalization deals with removing redundancy in the data. The output format has nothing to do with it.  
For reference ...
This data is flat. Price and time. Nothing to be normalized.

Specific to the word wallet. In the physical world ( the actual reason the word wallet exists ) Why would a wallet be any less of a wallet if it only contained a single bill ? Or even zero bills. As in that world , a wallet is just a device to contain things. Its not a "collection of" anything. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 02:00:23


Why ?? Make it a set BTC amount.  
@_date: 2015-03-27 22:00:15
Wouldn't really be hard to do. All you would really need is one guy in the states willing to print mailing labels and drop shit off at the post office every day. 
I would love to hear from the company. I am actually very surprised they haven't commented on this thread yet.

I think your missing the point that bitttBurger may be trying to make. 
This sort of project has been attempted a few times in the past. Perhaps not this specific task , but the general size and scope.
And in the past , when you let devs control anything beyond where to put the commas and braces in the code it is almost never successful by any rational metric. A developer , by nature , has a different way of thinking. Its sorta required to be a dev. What they ( generally ) see as important points , may be perfectly valid from his point of view , actual end users could give two fucks about.  There is a reason that most people don't learn about a specific piece of open source software untill someone with a marketing department starts fucking with it. 
They are speaking generally at first , and then gives examples about this specific issue that does not require knowing the person's skills , as they have demonstrated them ( by making this change without discussion ) and they have been shown to be lacking. 
Crazy is not learning from other people mistakes and doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results. I seem to remember some quote about that being a textbook definition of insanity .. or something like that. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 07:56:12
Or ... you could just price your item in btc and be done. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 03:17:58
So take this wonderful thing that is bitcoin , and add on top of it banks and other service providers ... 
Yea , lets just reinvent the wheel. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:25:36
Why would you need to do that ?? 
A properly designed back office system would have controls in place to keep most of that info private , even from support persons. There is no reason the guy on the other end of the phone ( first level )  would need the ability to see my banking details. 
Perhaps something like a phone pin .. Where the support person would need to input that to even get past the "account number / name" screen. 
Seriously , there are ways to do it , without exposing more then is NEEDED.
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:25:29
paypal is not ANY SORT OF bank ..

Umm .. if you only learned about github today ... I have to doubt you have the knowledge to understand the source. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:26:38
You are completely missing the point.. 
Your support employees SHOULD NOT have access to the complete details of your entire customer base. 
Background checks and bonding do nothing to prevent actual abuse. They simply reduce the amount of abuse that WILL happen. They should not be a replacement for actual proper compartmentalized security. 
Remember , a background check doesn't tell you if someone is a criminal or not , only if they have been caught before!

@_date: 2013-12-14 16:31:36
The system should be designed so that the support rep has access to ONLY the data they need , when they actually need it. As an example , there is no need for the phone rep that is dealing with a recent buy order needs to know the banking details of how the account was funded. 
Audit trails allow the company to spot breaches before they can do any serious damage. If you find that one of your reps access 500 accounts while only working 50 tickets in a shift. Thats a problem you need to address. 
The start of this fork , was the person claiming to be from coin base saying "You can't just pull any old person in off the street and give them access to the personal/banking information of half a million people." ..  We are not talking about the DBA's , or the systems admins , we are talking about front line support reps. 
Heck you could even put a pin in front of the reps access. Requiring the customer to provide the pin , so that the rep can even begin to access any information. 
The point is that the phone reps should NOT have access to half a million people personal details. At most , they should get access to the details of only the customers they interact with. And even then , that access should be audited regularly , and supervised properly. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:57:14
What the hell are you talking about ? 
First off , colin base requires none of that info to open/use an account. Email and password and its done. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:30:09
Understand what point ?? That the companies back office systems are not designed properly ?
It may not be simple, but proper back office system will have controls and audit trails in place to protect the sensitive information. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:26:05
