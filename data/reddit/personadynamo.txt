Is there any other way to get my Coinbase account verified besides connecting it with a bank account? I would love to get the Shift card, but it says that my account isn't verified. Essentially, I need a bank account to get the debit card. Stupid.

I sent coindesk an email today stating that I won't be trusting them anymore do to their ignorance. Ever since Barry S(D)ilbert bought Coindesk, it's been used to pump Ether. Mike Hearn's announcement oddly coincided with the commencement of the pump before homestead and the 93rd, or so declaration of BTC's death. That NYT article was oddly timed when ETH was in danger of being shorted below .01. The DAO is a technique to gain attention. Rootstock will send Ether to its grave. Then Augur will migrate.

Coinbase is a money hungry b***h just like this Ethereum scam. If Ethereum wasn't a scam, none of the orchestration to take everyone's money would be happening. Everyone involved from the foundation to the opinion piece writer at the New York Times that pumped it as it was tanking to the rushed DAO fiasco to create hype, are a liability for crypto. F Etc and Eth. Rootstock will bring smart contract functionality.

It's already happening; any needs are being met, or will be met head on. New tech start-ups will fill any and all gaps. Bitcoin is of the zeitgeist of our time. It embodies independece.

In a wallet with a few micro-payments, it costs .0007 BTC to send any transaction. A little expensive for someone in an economically depressed area with little money in the first place. This person might also be working for a crowdsourcing company and is paid in pennies for each task. The fee doesn't work well with the marketing of micro-payments.
