As someone who considers himself more of a lurker than a proper member of this community, allow me to provide my view on this topic.
First of all, seansoutpost is an *active* and *trusted* member of this community. It can be shown, if you follow his track record, that the donations are used in a fair way and that his contributions to this subreddit have always been positive.
This in essence, makes the bitcoin community trust him.
Now, this doesn't invalidate your points and my suggestion is that we simply make sure that seansoutpost is more open about the expenses of his organization.
Finally, to suggest another charity based on a set of standards that you have defined is better seems like a somewhat biased way of bringing up this topic. Why introduce one specific charity when warning us of sean's outpost?

legal : permitted by the law
law: the system of rules that a particular country or community recognizes as regulating the actions of its members and may enforce by the imposition of penalties.
i.e: regardless of whether you consider drug laws legal, it is likely that they are legal for the particular country where you reside. You could have used other terminology to express your view.

meh. Ubuntu 13.10 live usb:
1) open terminal
2) sudo apt-get install bitcoin-qt
3) Open bitcoin
There you go. You save 25 seconds by installing a bitcoin theme live CD. It isn't worth it.

I was thinking really hard about this, and I still haven't found a solution.
But we are pretty close. 
When you donate to a third world country charity, there is a VERY HIGH chance that only a small percentage of what you give is given to the people that need it. This is due to the overhead and corruption.
Example: your local mayor will not give you a permit to have a charity unless you give him x amount of pesos.
The problem is very hard, even with bitcoins, for the following reasons:
Suppose you give bitcoin adresses to each person in a village in Africa. Suppose that at least two merchands, a and b, take bitcoins to buy water and rice. 
Now, how do you guarantee that your donation is being giving to addresses that represent these people? 
What if an unknown 'benevolent philanthropist' is keeping all this money for himself? (ex: all addresses really belong to him)
What if A and B steal all villager's money or force them to reveal their password if they want to stay alive?
 It's a hard problem.

Where are you? In america? Do you realize that getting a credit card in the world is pretty damn hard?
Interest rates are also insane. 40-60% per year. Not kidding you.
If, by average person he meant 'average person' in the world, he's damn right.

You are not the only one =D

What part of 'rest of the world' don't you understand?
Brazil, India, China, etc. I am also in a developed country, but from where I come from, paying by card is really, really damn hard AND expensive.

future is here! You didn't do so bad!
100% profit ~ish in just 4 months!

I'm in the same position as you, I currently hold 0.4 btc. I'm not sure I'll get rich, but I had two chances before: when it was 64$/1btc and when it was ~11$/1btc.
I'll eventually get up to 1 btc this year and I'll hold it.
I am MUCH MUCH more excited by international trades once the value becomes very stable. No more western Union or insanely expensive bank transfers just to transfer 500$

If you are American or European, I guess there are no big gains unless you deal with other countries, which brings us to the real game changer:
If you are Brazilian, Argentinian, Chinese, etc, you get PLENTY of benefits. Your government cannot effectively control its own money anymore and you can finally reliably store money that the rest of the world sees as valuable.

someone in the future reporting.
His investment is now worth ~150% of the original value. 1 BTC: 330 USD
only 4 months have passed by

Probably. This isn't by itself something wrong. Since all bitcoins are created equal, having the *option* to use Bitcoins with charge backs, etc, doesn't mean that you *always* have to use them like that.
Oh, I need to buy a ps4 with bitcoins, I'll use ABB (American Bitcoin Bank) so that my purchase is protected.
Well, now I need to send 100 bitcoins to my business partner in Australia. No need for ABB here.

not even close to a sentence. Just a very long sequence of words from anime/tv shows/ books/quotes/etc that totally make sense in my head but don't even make sense gramatically and are full of numbers, etc
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:48:56
 if you need bitcoins NOW, through interact
Otherwise, localbitcoins.com. 
I don't know if buying is good these days

Just as a warning for Linux users, Ubuntu specially:
- Be VERY careful with your PPAs. If possible, elimnate all of them or as many as you can.
- Javascript can still fuck you over. Try chromium if possible
- Don't copy paste bash commands from random websites. ASK FIRST. If you don't understand something, admit that you don't know it and see what's up. 
it's easy to spot stuff like rm -rf /*, but be careful.
- Don't be too paranoid. Installing an operating system once per week is really non productive.

These days everything I want has Ubuntu PPA's.
I love this ^^

and... this is also there xD
some of the users there are still active today

Bad idea. A VM can be compromised. A partition of ubuntu, with the 'encrypt home folder' option picked is more than enough. Probably

just sayin'
capitalism is an economic system. Canada is considered a capitalistic state because it follows, mostly, this system. There are very different forms of capitalism, and the reality is often different from pure, abstract capitalism.
I don't understand capitalism myself, but do remember that it's just an economic system. That's all.

It's not about the government spending... it's about private ownership of the means of production and capital goods. 
It is entirely possible for people to rationalize that healthcare and certain services can be excluded from these, but the control of them is still in the hands of corporations and their ability to make a profit.
Ultimately, this is what makes it a capitalistic state.
Then again, we are not really arguing. Your definition of capitalism is more 'pure' or constrained than the one I think most people would use, but it's still a valid definition.

Just to add to his question, I disconnected from the internet, then generated a wallet.dat from a fresh ubuntu 13.10 install. I encrypted it using a long -yet-easy-to-remember password, and then encrypted it with ssl and put that on Dropbox.
Finally, I shred'ed wallet.dat and all files inside .bitcoin
I then reconnected to the internet, and I haven't entered my password ever since.
Am I safe? Should I reinstall? Should I have created an encrypted user directory? Will the double encryption corrupt my data?

I won exactly 0.00 BTC playing on bitzino, but I spend close to 3 hours, after starting with 0.01 BTC, losing it, refunding with 0.2 and cashing out at 0.3. I still love the video poker thing

"using a password that exceeds 30 characters and has never been used before online."
You are giving away too much information OP
