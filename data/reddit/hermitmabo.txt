Fairly recently, I wouldn't doubt that the website redesign happened at the same time.
I remember hearing about that change a week or two ago in Newegg was selling lifetime keys for like $20 before they stopped working.

The key difference is...the multibillion dollar company is connected to the internet for this, and has many employees in their offices.  Right there you have at least two avenues of attack, more if you want to get creative.  An employee could do something stupid, possible leak.  Something on the internet side is done wrong, leak.  Pose as an employee and get into the nonpublic areas, another leak.  Malware on a USB/email, reconstructing information from improperly decommissioned drives, MitM attacks, keyloggers infecting the personal computers of someone who works from home, all possible leaks.  A good deal of the security expense goes towards plugging all of these holes, be it with policies, training, software/upgrades, new gear. etc.
With cold storage, there are 2 main points of failure:  You and the computer making the keypairs.  If the generating computer has no / has never had internet access, the most massive attack vector was never opened.  If you use something like Tails or a freshly installed OS, it's all but impossible to attack the computer directly.  If you put the private keys on a flash drive, print them out, whatever, then you only need to be concerned with the physical security of something smaller than your thumb, possibly the security of your printer should you use one.  This got a hell of a lot easier with the release of the Trezor and similar devices, which should also be considered.
So you've hand-written and double-checked a paper wallet made from a secure computer, maybe even used BIP38 or something for added security.  You can bury that in your backyard and nobody's the wiser.  Now a robber needs to A- Notice you have bitcoins, B- Ransack your entire house and yard for even a chance to find the paper, and C- get any encryption keys from you.  That's a hell of a lot harder and less lucrative than just targeting security flaws in a company, since a company is almost guaranteed to have the data you want (A) and keeps it in a pretty obvious place (B, the company servers).  Now all they need to do is get access to that (C), so they use social engineering, 0-day exploits in common software, etc. to steal this data.  At this point the size of the company is practically working for the thief.
More vectors + big, obvious target compared to fewer vectors + small target + security in obscurity, take your pick.  It's basically the same deal as protecting your cash, you can get a safe as secure or insecure as you want ( cost/tech knowledge permitting ), or even put it in someone else's safe.

Not quite right.  When you mine the block and get your bitcoin, you don't get exactly 25btc (or 50, 12.5, etc).  You get that amount PLUS the transaction fees for any transactions included in the block.  That's the only time you can collect fees.  The idea being that, though the block reward will eventually halve to small/near 0 amounts, miners will still have an incentive to mine in the form of the transaction fees.  Additionally, though I don't know the exact method, it's possible to set your miners to ignore transactions with low/no fees.
So at each step of a bitcoin trade, you'll include a small fee that goes to whichever miner includes your transaction.  If BobCo Mining Enterprises decides not to include your trade with Cindy, the trade won't go through (yet) and BobCo doesn't get your included fee.  The transaction will basically be put on a waiting list.  When AliceCo includes your transaction on their newly-mined block, your actual bitcoin will go through to Cindy and AliceCo collects your fee.
Of course, if you really want to send your money as soon as possible, you can include a higher fee than normal.  The miners will naturally prioritise your transaction because hey, more bitcoin for including this transaction rather than some other one.

Papercoin, the new altcoin that can only be mined by hand!
...though depending on how it's created, programming computers to tackle that would probably be good for AI and the like.  Natural language learning or something.

Not really, it could be confused with data (1000 bits are worth that much?  Sheeeit, I've got a few billion on my 2GB USB drive!).  It also implies that this is the smallest unit of BTC, just as a bit is the fundamental block of computers (can't split a 1 or 0).  On the other hand, mBTC simultaneously reinforces that it is a complete but small amount ($1, 1 milligram of some substance) that can easily convert to other sizes as needed ($1k, 1 gram of sugar, 1 liter of water, etc.)
Of course this only works if the listener knows metric prefixes...but everyone really should, the Standard/Imperial system here in the US is an inferior  pain in the ass.

Bitcoin makes for some fantastic last-minute 'icing on the cake' gifts too.  Set one friend up with a disk of music, electrum, and 10mBTC in a vanity address.  Walked 2 others through setting up and sent another 10 each.

Meanwhile, I have only one friend that's really excited about Bitcoin and 2-3 others that think it's cool, but don't take it seriously.  Then about 2 dozen that still think its a complete joke.
Which is odd, as the only one that thinks it's really cool is the least tech-savvy of my friends.
Guess I know which ones are getting pieces of my one whole Bitcoin.

Accurate, yes, but it looks similar to a 'u', and most people won't bother with the actual 'mu' symbol.
For instance, I don't know anyone that calls it 'mu-torrent'.  Anyone that's mentioned the software has said 'you-torrent'.  I don't see anything keeping Average Joe from doing the same and calling a microbit a 'you-bit'

I'm guessing due to the sheer power of its encryption if done right.  If I'm assuming correctly, the audit team would need to test basically every aspect of Truecrypt for weaknesses:  Website/download, executable, each encryption scheme, etc. and make sure that they're all as bulletproof (mostly the encryption ofc) as we seem to think it is.
So we're talking about finding some weakness in a very solid piece of software.  Maybe its RNG always throws the same pattern every few thousand digits?  Maybe AES/Serpent encryption is 10% weaker on a Mac for some reason?  Who knows?  That's what they're looking for.
KeePass, OTOH, would be more like  'site damn secure?  Encryption (in specific universal implementation, JS in a browser iirc) safe?  No wonky leaks and shit?  Alright boys lets pack up, shit's solid' 
KeePass is probably a bit more centralized and has fewer factors to complicate analysis, as opposed to the  'hey here's a ton of options so it's as secure as you feel like making it' .

Expanding upon keenanpepper's comment, any estimates on the turnaround time for checks?  I've been trying to get into bitcoin for a while, but it appears the simplest method is going to be based on checks and waiting 3+ days for Coinbase to do its thing.
