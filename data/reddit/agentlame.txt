Um, devolves into an anti-any-big-tech-company circlejerk any time a negative story about that company comes out.
Hate to break it to you, but Apple is not special in this regard.

Speaking of bot spam.  &amp;

The comment reads "We like fictitious sci fi technology here in and the one below it reads "They like "bitch about copyright law" technology and "bitch about ISPs" technology." and **your** response to them reads "Yeah but they also like "bitch about Paypal" technology, so you can see where I'm confused."
I'm sorry, what does any of that have to do with the bot?  And how is any of that helping to convince anyone it should be unbanned.
Put another way instead of my comment above, how would you have responded if I had just said "yeah, in they just like to bitch about are comments like that productive for any of us?

He was banned for PM spamming/trolling.  If you look at the linked thread he even has a comment that he is PMing me stupid shit.  Further, I **warned** him not to after the first PM.  Afterwhich he sent me a more hostile and more childish ont.
**WOW.** Indeed.

Feel free to post the second PM that got you banned.

Agreed.  I'm a little dismayed and confused by this post.  Especially given the [needlessly hostile comments]( and votes it's generating.
I'm not sure if OP has some sort of agenda, but this post makes me think they do.

How?  We link to in our sidebar?
And what does bot spam have to do with subreddits?
**EDIT**  
Since this is a reply to the top comment, I'll say this here: the bot has unbanned.  I still don't think the bot spam is of any value.  But I also don't want this becoming a bigger issue than it seems to be becoming.  This all could have been resolved in a much more friendly manner.
