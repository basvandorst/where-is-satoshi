Only been in crypto for about six months but just wondering why this keeps happening? Like with all the past crashes and then rebounding why are people still getting freaked out? Bitcoin seems to have proved its resilience over the years in my opinion.

This is why I love max Keiser. He’s close to old as some of these fools and always has them spinning on their heads. These old guys won’t listen to younger generations.

Plus the whole shady BCH fiasco. Up until then I didn’t even mind them. High fees were understandable as they were one of few that could convert fiat to bitcoin. Not saying it’s fair but at the end of the day they’re a business and they’re trying to generate as much revenue as possible. The BCH thing was what really did it for me. Fuck coinbase.

There is a FAQ page that is really helpful on the site. I know some banks don’t work with Quadriga in which it can then be difficult. I am with RBC And use the E-transfer option and it’s incredibly quick and easy. If you’re going to get into cryptos then it might be a good idea to open an account with them just for this reason.

Before you get into anything with that guy, take a look at his posts. His entire account is posting negative shit about cryptos.
