A patch for Bitcoin Knots that implements BIP 148: 
@_date: 2016-06-09 10:43:42
Illuminating talk. From this you can really see how the bigger blockers frame the debate and ideas in their head.
It is clear that Erik Voorhees at least isn't a 'huge-blocker' rather a more moderate block-size proponent.
edit:  I've made this post into a new topic: 
There is some conceptional ideas that seem to be missing from hearing them talk. I'll try and briefly outline them here.
There are really two real camps of thought in Bitcoin; they hold slightly different views on the fundamental axiom of "What is Bitcoin".
* Group **A**: Bitcoin is a A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.  (Or The Satoshi Bitcoiners)
* Group **B**: Bitcoin is a Consensus system that provides Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash as a core service.
Group **A** see the Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, and the Consensus Blockchain as just the way it is implemented. All functions of bitcoin should directly increase the economic purpose of the "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" or they are spam.
Group **B** see see a Consensus system. They see a community that has agreed to a set of rules and the economic purpose of the network is not the only thing to consider. They set the "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" as one of the many possible services that Bitcoin provides. The sable and safe operating of the entire is more important than any particular economic concerns system that it supports.
With this in mind, it is clear that for many many technical decisions both groups agree. However block-size often splits them.
I'll take a slightly different argument first: Spam Transactions.
Group **A** are against spam.  They can clearly decide that transactions that don't further the economic purpose of the "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" as spam. The want to block or discourage such transactions from the network.
Group **B** ask "*what is spam?*":  They see Bitcoin Transactions as either complying with the network rules or not. They don't care about the "what" or "why" a transaction. The only care that the total *cost* of the transaction is accurately accounted for.
If somebody wanted to fill the entire blocks with OP_RETURN and was willing to out-compete everyone else on fees.
Group 'A' would yell:


Group 'B' would not be worried but go:


Group 'A' want to know the "what" and "why" of transactions. They care "what" a transaction dose. They care "why" the transaction was made. The **must** know this information if they wish to be able to tell what is a spam transaction and what isn't.
Group 'B' don't care about "what" and "why" of transactions.  They only care that the network is stable, and that transactions that are more expensive for the network are more expensive to make.
Group 'B" **Infer** the economic value of transactions by deducing from "*what*" is in the transaction, or of-chain "*why*" it was made.
Group 'B" **Observe** the economic value of transactions by watching how much somebody is willing to spend to make one.
From this, I hope the readers can start to see the debate in a more clear picture.

An exceptional example of open-source development and community work.  This code is some of the most tested and audited code that has been released for a complex system.
Even then, this is not the end of testing. Soon everyone will be able to run Segregated Witness on the testnet.

There are many issues with this essay; really I was quite disappointed with Roger. The primary one being intellectual dishonesty from the use of a bad analogy.  While this in itself doesn’t invalidate Rogers other claims, it doses put the other claims in poor light.
Firstly, to address the fundamental issue with the Starbucks analogy:  Bitcoin isn’t like Starbucks Corporation; while there is only one Bitcoin Blockchain, there are tens of thousands of Starbucks stores.
To respond to increases in demand Starbucks can just open more stores (that operate more-or-less independently).  However, with Bitcoin, we cannot just ‘add more nodes’ to respond to an increase in demand; as every (full) node must carry the entire burden of the network.
Roger dose correctly state:


However, his statement is intellectually dishonest as he doesn’t analyze what the marginal cost actually is. Where in reality, the marginal cost of including a transaction in a not-full block is virtually zero.  Meaning that it doesn’t matter what size blocks you have, they will constantly be full. (with exception to miners who have differing policies, but the economically rational miner will include transactions that have any fee above zero).
As we continue Roger doesn’t analyse the problems and benefits of blocks being full, instead, based upon his Starbucks fallacy, he just assumes that full blocks are bad. There are two main arguments of why ‘full blocks’ isn’t the evil that Roger plays it to be:
1.	It is economically unavoidable. (The marginal cost of creating and including transactions is virtually zero).
2.	Without full blocks there isn’t any fee-pressure. Where fees are increasingly important to the long-term health of the network. As the subsidy runs down, this should be compensated by an increase in transaction fees.
Yet neither of these arguments are addressed in Rogers essay.
Thus we come to the core contention of Rogers essay: (I paraphrase) “If we increase the blocksize, blocks will meet capacity again”.  This is namely false, as it is completely reasonable to expect that blocks of any size to be full.
Roger dose a good job of arguing how is it is ‘possible’ to increase the blocksize. He completely fails to put it into a well-reasoned context of ‘why’ we need to rise the blocksize limit.
The marginal cost of getting into the ‘full’ blocks that are on the network now (with the 1MB limit), is only 8 cents (US). see: 
* Roger dose not address that there is virtually no fee-curve meaning: There are only really two types of transactions on the network: spam and fee paying. (edit: in that to outbid the spam, you only need to increase your fee from 4 cents to 8 cents; suggesting there isn't a strong demand for extra block-space from real fee-paying users.)
* Roger also doesn’t address the economic implications of these 8 cent fees on the network. He doesn’t address at what point do fees become so large that it does have significant economic implications.
* Roger doesn’t address any argument of what point we should start considering a fee market important to the future of Bitcoin (with miners being paid by fees).
Overall this essay is an embarrassment, and anti-intellectual.  I can only assume that Roger didn’t put this essay out to rigours peer-review before publishing it.

Incredible work! You can separate the crypto wannabes and experts by how many birds they can hit with one stone.
Eg. SegWit solves a very long list of issues in a backwards compatible way. Where the 2mb hardfork arguably 'just' solves one issue in a backwards incompatible way.
Of course there is an incredible amount of work to go from this mailing list post to a deployable implementation. It is good to have this information public and 'out there'.

Thank-you for writing this; the UASF is the community exercising their natural homesteading rights of Bitcoin.
One can imagine that Bitcoin is a sick child; the child has a birth-defect where the transaction hash includes both: the movement of the coins; and witness that the shows that such a movement of coins is correctly authorised.
The amazing doctors and surgeons who have been trying to keep this Bitcoin child alive noticed this birth-defect, publicised it; and painstaking produced a treatment called commonly called "SewWit".  This SegWit treatment is an incredible feat of engineering, not-only it fixes the birth-defect without requiring invasive-time-stop surgery (such as with a hard-fork), but it also fixes many other small defects in the same process.
When the Bitcoin Surgeons presented this fantastic treatment, to their amazement some people (who were secretly taking advantage of another of Bitcoin's birth defects in the form of ASICBOOST), rejected the "SegWit" treatment.  It only later becomes apparent that one-treatment, treats another.  Where the SegWit treatment also (partly) fixes the defect that enables ASICBOOST.
The Bitcoin Community is like the collective parents of Bitcoin, we love Bitcoin and want it to be strong and self sufficient one-day.  However Bitcoin is still just a small child; Giving a child growth hormones in the form of larger blocks is not a good way to raise a child!  It is far better to fix the defects that are stopping the child from growing naturally.
This is why I propose, as a parent of Bitcoin, that we activate the "SegWit" treatment, with-or-without those who wish Bitcoin to remain sick. UASF is the parents forcing those who are blocking Bitcoin's treatment to leave the property; force being naturally violent, however in this very server case; it is absolutely legitimate force.
Nobody is stopping anyone from using a clone of Bitcoin that doesn't use the SegWit treatment, we are just forcing them not to block the treatment of "Our Bitcoin".

The nice thing is that those miners don't have a choice any-longer since this has provided huge traction for doing a UASF. :)

Thank you for your support!
For BIP 148 to be a success it really needs to be a ground-upwelling of support around it.
Just do what you are good at.  If you are adept at writing letters; write letter. Art: make art.  Coding: Contribute Patches.
Do whatever you want. Find your own niche! :) Be great at it! :)
Most importantly, study and learn for yourself if you really support BIP 148 with it's trade-offs and risks. I recommend you only support something that agrees with your personal ideology.

'Tis is going to be a fun party! I've already preparing my unnecessarily sexy UASF outfit.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:34:20
I support BIP148. However this forceful approach goes against the Non-Agression-Principle that I subscribe to.
Your "consequences be dammed" attitude is terrifying! This is the ideology that allows atrocities to happen "for the greater good".
I choose BIP148 because I DO care about the consequences! Because I think that it is a good thing, and that I think that it is a valid thing to do. - I don't think that forcing miners to change one bit in their block headers in a backwards compatible way to activate SegWit is unreasonable.
However, I'm not going to attack others if they don't agree. I will try and persuade and convince detractors, however it is I who choose what code I run and I choose BIP148. It is up to detractors to choose their own code to run.
Of course, it it will be a much more comfortable activation if we have 51% hashrate supporting it. However, because the incentives are asymmetrical, I don't expect the miners to fight.
Remember, the very same tatic that is used to activate SegWit via BIP148 can and will be used against you to activate a evil soft fork. We don't want to accept behaviour of people being violent to activate anything!

This is the key point. If you see bitcoin as just a payment system. Then you miss the vast real reason that Bitcoin is disruptive.
Bitcoin is disruptive as it gives people a secure store of value.  Allowing people to plan over longer time frames.  The build-up of private capital is the most fundamental thing for healthy communities to form.
Bitcoin allows people to stop worrying about (the capital for) paying for food tomorrow, and rather put their efforts into making long-term investments into improving the world they live in.
To contrast this with the current system dose everything in it's power to frustrate the lives of savers. - The current system wants people to only 'invest' (in equity) of the future. Private savings are seen as 'unproductive' capital, where the casino of the stock market is somehow seen as 'productive'.
If you don't have private capital, you won't have market depth. A society with great personal savings will have incredible market depth relative to average trading volume. (Because if people have savings there is a 'potential' for very large volumes). Making even low volume markets very liquid.
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:12:55
I cannot agree with your analysis.
BIP148 only forces the miners to change one bit in the blocks they mine. It doesn't force them to support or even upgrade to SegWit.
The depoloyment of SegWit enforcing nodes on the network is overwhelming. There is no question about the public support for SegWit. The only question is why are the miners blocking it? Well if you read between the lines, everything points toward AsicBoost.
The users temporarily delegated control of the activation of SegWit to the miners. Now with BIP148, the users are revoking control. Quite Legitimaly. If you ask me.
