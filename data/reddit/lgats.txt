I made a tool to check the status of your SSL and see if heartbeat is enabled. If it is, you should run this command: openssl version -a
Ensure your version is NOT 1.0.1f, 1.0.1e, 1.0.1d, 1.0.1c, 1.0.1b, 1.0.1a, 1.0.1, 1.0.2-beta1

I think the idea is that even if breaking bitcoin with quantum computing is possible, it will take some years before a quantum computer could break your key in the time between when your transaction is first broadcasted and when it is committed to the blockchain.

Purchase protection is much different from chargebacks on PayPal. This simply means the sender of the payment will not be able to dispute the charge from the transaction page on PayPal, but they can still file a dispute with their credit card. Additionally, this does not impact how chargebacks are handed for fradulant payments.

Thanks for adding this. Regarding BTC, according to [bitcoin.it wiki](

The difficulty can drop fairly quickly. BCH started off with less than 2% of the hashpower of BTC and didn't gain more than 10% hashpower until 4 days ago.

Can you elaborate? Does any miner have enough BCH to move the market much?
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:58:15
Bitcoin miners do different work than what it takes to mine ETH. 
An ASIC bitcoin miner cannot mine ETH.

In terms of the individual miner, switching won't really impact either chain at large. It's a prisoner's dilemma sort of problem.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:05:33


This is wild. No more BTC-BCH mining games of the type we've been seeing. Should be overall more stable for both coins.

Unfortunately, you have been most certainly scammed. 
What you can expect: 
In the next couple days, the funds will arrive in your bank account.
Between 1 and 180 days from now, the charge will be reversed from PayPal as a fraudulent transaction. At this point,  your PayPal account will have a negative balance (assuming your balance is $0 now). PayPal will then either attempt to withdraw the funds from your bank account or they will pester you to bring your account balance out of the negative for up to 90 days(ish). If they are unable to get you to bring your balance back up, they will suspend/close your account and send the balance due to a collection agency. 
Sorry about your luck.
