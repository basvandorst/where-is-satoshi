I'm still thinking about converting some of my bitcoin to dogecoin. Not for the stability or profit but just because.

So why would anyone send him bitcoins? I'm sure if you bribe most people they will tell positive things...

i sold when it was at 600 last time. I earned a little bit then (never invested a lot since I dont have much to spare with my mortgage and all). However I do feel that even right now is a good time to buy.

The gif/image didn't load for me so I was just sitting here thinking brilliant, a very nice comparison about missing out... and then it loaded
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:47:27
Yes I dont really see the benefit from this.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:30:28
are you lost?

I sold at 500 and bought back at 550. I clearly have no idea what i'm doing

From the image I though it was going to be a guy shooting himself in the foot - cause that is my experience with daytrading :(

this seems low, I can actually give someone an invite for bitcoins ^^

I signed up a while a go, it takes forever to get verified and the only thing I see is the price rising, rising, rising.
I wanted to buy when they hit 50 dollar mark. Still haven't got any and it has been doubled since then.

i bought a little bit when it was dropping (about 40 dollars worth). Dont have enough to really profit though
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:42:57
I logged out and back in for you without any problems.
@_date: 2013-03-27 10:46:09
Thanks, that's a very reasonable advice, and a good example.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:28:29
I didn't because I bought in at almost all time high point before the bubble bust
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:41:33
There is a good chance somebody at your work stole it. Try and investigate.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:21:01
it's empty
@_date: 2013-04-25 06:46:46
I'm so jealous that I didn't have money to spare for something like this.
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:14:57
You should just rebuy the coins you spend though
