Counterpoint: I use Apple Pay on a regular basis. My local grocery store supports it. I rarely have any problems with it. Using it from my watch is extremely smooth. I don't have to take *anything* out of my pockets to pay.
There have been only 2 instances (out of hundreds of uses) where my Apple Pay was declined. I suspect it was a problem with the terminal, not the Apple Pay system (because both times it happened at the same self-checkout register).
Praising Bitcoin as a superior alternative is kind of a joke, considering that bitcoin is accepted almost nowhere.

I find that more often than not, this policy is completely misunderstood. An "in-app purchase" is defined as a purchase that enhances the app itself in someone way. This could be unlocking a feature (like editing documents in Microsoft Office for iPad), or downloading some content that is consumed within the app (like Kindle eBooks).
This in-app purchase policy **does not** apply to physical goods (see: eCommerce apps such as Amazon, Walmart, Target, or Best Buy), nor does it apply to digital goods that are consumed outside the app (see: Steam).
This in-app purchase policy **does not** apply to the trade of money (see: countless banking apps, PayPal, Square Wallet), nor does it apply to trading assets/stocks (see: E\*Trade app).
Apple absolutely could continue their policy of banning apps that circumvent the in-app purchase process. This would not necessarily apply to Bitcoin apps. For instance, you could very easily implement a Bitcoin wallet that doesn't violate Apple's policy on in-app purchases, as long as that app doesn't allow you to unlock functionality by spending Bitcoin.
I don't know why Apple doesn't allow Bitcoin apps on the App Store, but I can almost guarantee that it has nothing to do with this 30% in-app purchase fee, because Bitcoin transactions are not necessarily in-app purchases.

General computer news can just as easily be construed as "related" to Bitcoin because you need computers to mine it, but general computing articles shouldn't get posted here either.

With the current business model, content creators can still make money from content years after it's been released. I could still buy Ghost Busters on DVD, and the creators would presumably get a cut of that.

Debt is not going to go away. People want to buy things that they can't afford yet. This is not a side effect of inflation, it is human nature.
For example: I would like to buy a car. I can either save my money until I can buy it outright, or I can take out a loan. The problem is that I can't make any money unless I have a car to get to work, so my only realistic option is to take out a loan, and realize the benefits of car ownership today.
Another example: I would like to by a home. I can either choose to be homeless until I save up to buy a house, or I can take out a mortgage and have my very own bed to sleep in. Ignoring of the rate of inflation or deflation, which option do you think I would prefer?

Uh, no, not really. A buggy Bitcoin wallet could absolutely submit a transaction twice.

I'm willing to bet that the stuff you own is worth more than the money you have. In a deflationary economy, that stuff becomes worth less and less (because you would sell it for less money than you could before). 
Let's say you have $100,000 worth of property, and $10,000 worth of cash. Deflation hits at 10%, meaning you can now buy 10% more stuff with your money, but your stuff will sell for 10% fewer dollars than it did before. That means you now have $11,000 worth of money, but only $90,000 worth of stuff. Your net worth has decreased by $9,000.
The only winners in a deflationary economy are those with more money than stuff, and very few people fit that profile.

Every time I try to bring up the deflation argument, someone inevitably pounces on it and points out that "people always need to buy food" as if that somehow invalidates my point.
The problem with a deflationary currency lies with *investments*. Let's say you're looking to start a business. Unless you're already wealthy, you will need to find someone willing to invest in you. In order to make their investment worthwhile, you need to not only outpace the rate of deflation, but outpace it by a wide enough margin to justify the risk involved. If you can't prove that you can do that, they would be smarter to just stuff their money under their mattress and let it grow in value all on its own.

I find that the number one reason webapps feel sluggish is because the developer uses javascript's "onclick" event for buttons, links, and so forth. The problem is that the browser deliberately delays that event to make sure you aren't about to double-tap.
The correct thing to do is implement the "touchend" event instead. That will get fired immediately after the user lifts their finger from the button (exactly like a native app).
As for the browser "chrome" (small c, as in the tabs, navigation bar, etc), that can easily be hidden by adding some specific &lt;meta&gt; tags to the HTML. iOS will treat it like it's own package, rather than a "home screen bookmark", making it feel more like a native app.
I wish more web app developers would go the extra mile to make these web apps behave correctly. It's not *that* hard, and I think the payoff is definitely worth it.

No I didn't. Amazon's decision to not sell digital goods has nothing to do with giving Apple 30% of their revenue, because that only comes into play when you're buying content that enriches the app. If Amazon wants to sell digital goods (that you can later download on your computer), they can do so without dealing with Apple's in-app purchase rules.

The only study I know of was one that compared Silk Road numbers to the transaction volume of the *entire Bitcoin economy*. This is flawed for two reasons:
1. Silk Road is not the only entity in the world selling drugs for Bitcoin
2. Merely shifting coins from one of your wallets to another counts as a "transaction", so the number was probably watered down by all these so-called "transactions" that didn't actually involve an exchange of goods or services.

Not necessarily. A single episode of Breaking Bad for instance costs millions of dollars to produce. The most successful kickstarter campaign ever (Pebble smartwatch) only raised $10 million, and the vast majority of backers paid over $100. This would cover maybe 3 or 4 episodes of that show.
Let's suppose a single episode of Anime costs $1,000,000 (for voice actors, animators, writers, overhead, etc). Assuming you somehow managed to get as many backers as the pebble, do you think each of those people would be willing to pay more than, say $10 for a single episode of a TV show? That would mean a season of 10 episodes would cost $100 – way more than what you probably would have paid for a season pass on iTunes.
Keep in mind: as long as the goal is reached, you get the content, regardless of whether you contributed or not. Paying nothing to get free content is awfully tempting.

The Internet analogy drives me nuts because it's such a great example of selection bias. There have been countless projects that could also be compared to the Internet, but never took off like the Internet has. The only reason you never hear about those is because everyone forgot about them after they failed.
One of my favorite examples is Google Wave. When it launched, a lot of people truly believed that it was going to be the successor to email. Many even compared it to email of the early days, and pointed out that even email had its critics once upon a time. But now, Google Wave is pretty much dead, and the age-old Email protocol lives on.
In my opinion, Bitcoin has more in common with BitTorrent than the Internet as a whole. It's an open, decentralized, protocol that sits *on top of* the Internet. Due to a few (or a lot) of bad actors, the protocol has earned a bad reputation, even though the technology itself is not evil.

Because the law says so, and also because the fed has access to a bottomless wallet. It can produce as many BitDollars as it sees fit.

BitDollars wouldn't be any more scarce of a resource as existing paper or digital money. If a bank was running low on BitDollars, they could exchange some of their digital or paper dollars with the fed for more BitDollars.

I was only responding to the allegation that Apple's ban on Bitcoin apps had something to do with in-app purchases. Since in-app purchases only come into play when you're buying content or functionality that gets used within the app, Bitcoin wallets should have no problem avoiding these rules (assuming they're just a wallet, and not something more).

Saving money is not an option for someone with overdue bills living paycheck to paycheck. The reason those poor people spend money as soon as they get it is because they need the things they're spending money on. Deflation doesn't change that. Maybe you need to reevaluate your definition of "poor."


People don't take out a mortgage because it's a good investment. They take out a mortgage so they can buy a house to *live in*. Houses are expensive, and people naturally want to buy things that they can't afford. Nobody is going to want to continue living with their parents for 10+ years while they save up for their own home.

And then Google Wave died shortly after.
People like to compare Bitcoin to email, because email overcame a lot of early criticism. But there are probably *more* products and technologies out there that that failed anyway. We just don't hear about those technologies *because they failed*.
In my opinion, the one thing that caused email to really take off was the existence of email *providers*. Instead of going to the trouble of configuring your own mail server, you would just get a free email address by signing up for Internet access, or sign up for hotmail. Your email was wholly under someone else's control, they just let you have access to it – and people *liked* that.
If we assume that Bitcoin walks the same path as Email, where do you suppose Bitcoin will be in 10 years? Most people would own cloud wallets hosted by Google or Apple or Microsoft because it's the most convenient. Since losing your private key would be a hassle, these companies will happily make "backups" of your private key so you can rest easy. Of course, if they have your private key, that means your money can be seized by the government, or stolen by a malicious hacker. And suddenly we're back to the central banking system of today.

Would also be an incredibly risky business model.
First of all: You're capping your own potential revenue by design. Once you release the torrent, people will stop paying.

People tend to value convenience over security. That's why those god-awful security questions exist. If someone forgets their pass phrase, they would expect to be able to confirm their identity somehow and get access to their money again.

How many people are actually using kickstarter in this way today? I don't think it's very many. Why do you think that is? What's stopping them? Is it because people are worried that kickstarter is a middleman that will "censor and defraud them"? No. It's because the kickstarter model is simply a bad fit for digital content sales.
Instant gratification is a huge aspect of buying digital goods. This is evident by the move towards streaming services over digital downloads (Netflix, Spotify, iTunes Radio, Playstation Now, etc). Having to pay for something months or even years ahead of time isn't going to fly.
Furthermore, your proposed business model is broken for two reasons:
1. You're putting consumers in a prisoner's dilemma situation: if you pay and the project gets funded, you get the content. If you *don't* pay, and the project *still* gets funded, you get the content anyway. Regardless of whether you fork over the money, you have no way of controlling whether or not you get the content. In a way, you're punishing the people who funded the project, because they're the only ones who had to pay for the content.
2. You assume entrepreneurs will be okay with capping their potential revenue, even if their content turns into a runaway hit. The free market is based on greed. The whole point is for people to make as much money as possible.

@_date: 2014-03-26 14:21:00


Uhm... Very easily?
The only thing that qualifies as an in-app purchase is something that adds content or functionality to the app itself. Countless online (and offline) retailers allow you to buy goods and services without using the in-app purchase system. There's even a Steam app that allows you to buy Steam games using your Steam account. The reason these apps are allowed to exist is because these purchases don't add any content or functionality to the app itself.
As long as the Bitcoin wallet app doesn't try to sell you any content- or functionality-adding in-app purchases you should be fine. And if it *did* offer content- or functionality-adding in-app purchases, you should *still* be okay as long as those specific purchases use Apple's in-app purchase framework.
As far as this "iPay" rumor goes, I'll believe it when I see it. For now, it's still just rumors and speculation.

I don't think I agree with you. In the past year, Bitcoin has swung from $1,200 per coin to $500 per coin. In that same timespan, the value of the dollar has fluctuated by less than 5%.
In my opinion, a single unit of an ideal currency should represent a single, unchanging unit of value. This is difficult because value gets created out of thin air all the time. A canoe is more valuable than the wood it's made of. By using wood to build a canoe, you have just increased the net value of the economy.
The only way to keep the value of money stable is to increase (or decrease) the supply of money at the same rate that the economy grows (or shrinks).
Bitcoin, on the other hand, represents a *percentage* of the economy, not a fixed unit of value. This means that as the economy grows (or shrinks), the value of a single Bitcoin must grow (or shrink) with it. It's impossible to prevent an economy from growing or shrinking, thus it's impossible to stabilize the value of Bitcoin.

If the content creator releases the torrent themselves and endorses it as a valid distribution channel, then downloading the file from them would not be illegal (since they hold the copyright – i.e. The right to make copies)
If the content creator *does not* release the torrent themselves, but it gets on torrent sites without their permission, using this torrent is absolutely illegal, because it was not authorized by the copyright holder.

When a merchant performs a Bitcoin transaction and immediately exchanges it for fiat (via Coinbase et al), they exert downward price pressure on the market. It's essentially no different than selling Bitcoin for cash, except that you're getting "paid" in goods and services instead of fiat.
Hoarders operate by pulling bitcoins out of circulation. Since fewer bitcoins are being traded, the worth of a single Bitcoin has to go up in order for the market to hold the same net value.
I have yet to see a single good or service that can *only* be purchased in Bitcoin that doesn't have a suitable alternative purchasable in fiat (specifically, USD because I live in the USA). The fact that merchants merely *accept* Bitcoin would not have a very strong effect on the market (except for the very mild PR bump).

BitTorrent clients are used almost exclusively for piracy. That seems like a pretty legitimate reason to me.
3rd party browsers would pose a security risk. Even Safari has had some pretty major security holes in the past, but at least Apple has complete control over Safari (and UIWebViews that are used within 3rd party apps) so they can patch the bugs when they find them. If Firefox were to launch a custom browser on the platform, and it was found to contain security holes, Apple's hands would be tied. That seems like a good reason to me.
Until very recently, the legality of Bitcoin was fuzzy and unknown. That seems like a good reason to keep them out of the App Store.
Phone Story was an app that dragged Apple's name through the mud.

I don't think it is irrelevant.
The reason homemade mail servers are treated like spam is because the vast majority of users began using large-scale email providers like Gmail. Because almost nobody uses a homemade mail server, it isn't unreasonable to assume that mail coming from a residential IP address is suspicious.
In the same way, the vast majority of Bitcoin wallets will be controlled by a small number of big players, and any independent wallets will look suspicious (especially if that wallet has lots of money in it). It's hard to say what that suspicion would lead to (maybe vendors would wait for more transaction confirmations, or maybe law enforcement would be more likely to target you), but it would look suspicious nonetheless.

Yes, the timing was unfortunate, but it was purely coincidental (or maybe someone took that as an opportunity to leak the photos to make Apple look bad).
The iBrute tool required the victim's email address associated with their Apple ID. Email addresses aren't exactly private, but celebrities don't exactly broadcast their personal email address to the world either. It takes more effort than just Googling "Jennifer Lawrence email address."
Given the vast number of celebrities that were affected, and the relatively short amount of time that the exploit was known, I find it hard to believe that the tool was used to compromise more than a handful of the affected accounts. It's far more likely that these photos were accumulated over a long period of time using other techniques (security questions, phishing, etc).

The "apps" that it downloads aren't native apps. They're web apps. Web apps have been around since iOS 1.0. They're also severely limited compared to native apps (since they effectively run within a web browser). It will be tough to get these apps to match the performance of a native app.
The store itself looks like it's being distributed using an enterprise certificate, which Apple could revoke. Other no-jailbreak app stores have popped up in the past, but they've all been shut down by Apple. This one probably won't be any different.
Of course, even if Apple does shut them down, they could still operate by using the "Save to Home screen" feature of Safari. But that's an ugly workaround, and completely breaks the illusion of the "App Store". It becomes immediately obvious that you're basically just buying access to a web page.

But even if that isn't the norm, you still have people with piss-poor consumer-grade Internet connections (especially in the US), using low-quality consumer-grade hardware (e.g. Cheap, failure-prone hard drives), who are completely liable to go offline for extended periods of time (vacation, etc) with no warning whatsoever.
Certainly not comparable to most businesses who use industry-standard 3x redundancy.

This subreddit loves to talk about remittances as if half the world even knows what that word means. The truth is, the vast majority of humans will probably never leave their home country for an extended period of time, so they never have to think about remittances.
Bitcoin is a *fantastic* solution to the problem of remittances, but let's face it — it's not a problem most people will ever face.

Gold and Bitcoin cannot be created from nothing. This is a problem because value *can* be created from nothing. If I use my two legs to help my friend move out of his apartment, I have created value. He might pay me with a beer. If I make a painting, and sell it for $1000, I have created value.
Bitcoin and gold represent a fixed *percentage* of the economy. However, the net worth of the economy grows and shrinks by the second. As the net value of the economy fluctuates, the value of Bitcoin and gold fluctuate with it. No amount of mainstream adoption can change this.

... and was abused by third party developers. Apple was earning 30% of every transaction, while the third party developers were earning 70%. Apple can't possibly ban these apps because they completely fit within the App Store guidelines, and banning them would surely result in an even bigger shitstorm than they're currently in.
The fault either lies with the third party developers for manipulating kids into spending money, or the parents for not enabling parental controls (or flat out telling their password to their kid).
The fact that this somehow became Apple's fault is ludicrous to me. That would be like blaming the Bitcoin core devs for building a system that enabled money laundering or drug dealing.

And now we're back to third parties looking over your shoulder. Your web host has access to your server, which means they have access to all your email.
The point I'm trying to make is this: on paper, email seems like a perfectly decentralized and open protocol, and it even started out on the right foot. But after a few decades of use, it's slowly becoming more centralized (gmail, hotmail, yahoo, etc), and more proprietary (MS exchange). You can still create your own mail servers, but doing so is becoming increasingly unviable except in extreme circumstances.
You would be naïve to think that Bitcoin will remain immune to the forces that pushed email into its current state. 10 years from now, Bitcoin will either be dead or unrecognizable. And not necessarily in a good way.

And I'm saying that reason doesn't hold up. Even if Apple did start allowing Bitcoin-enabled apps in their App Store, it wouldn't erase all their previous App Store rules.
If your app offers in-app purchases without using the in-app purchase API (regardless if it's via credit card, Paypal, Bitcoin, or wire transfer), your app will be banned. This rule would still be upheld regardless of whether they allow Bitcoin apps or not.

Nope. You still owe $100, and you still have $80 on hand. Except now, that extra $20 you need is worth more, and thus harder to get.
Another way to think about it: If your $80 yesterday was worth $100 today, then your $100 debt yesterday is worth $125 today. So now you owe $5 more than you did before.

In my analogy, 1 "death" represents 1 drug transaction.
A lot of people die from cancer because a lot of people get cancer. A lot of people buy drugs with dollars simply because a lot of people have dollars.
By comparison, not as many people die from Ebola, simply because not as many people get Ebola. Similarly, not as many people buy drugs with Bitcoin because not as many people have Bitcoin.
Someone with Ebola is more likely to die than someone with cancer. Someone with Bitcoin is more likely to be a drug buyer/seller than someone who only has dollars.
(Note: "more likely" is not the same as "more *than* likely" — I am not saying most Bitcoin users are drug dealers. Just that a bitcoiner chosen at random is more likely to be a drug dealer than a non-bitcoiner chosen at random)

Not by 1000%, but if overall sales increased 100% (i.e. doubled), and Bitcoin revenue only increased by 25%, then Bitcoin would be making up a smaller percentage of sales than it was before, causing that 1% figure to shrink.

And the fed could very easily meet that demand by releasing more and more BitDollars (and taking other dollars out of circulation at the same time, of course).


Yes, because that's what keeps the value stable. The only way to keep the value of money stable is to make sure the money supply matches the net value of the economy. This is difficult because value can be created out of thing air. Bitcoin will always be a volatile currency no matter how much mainstream adoption it gets, simply because *economies* are in constant fluctuation, and a finite currency like Bitcoin merely represents a percentage of that fluctuating economy.

Not necessarily. You can make a Bitcoin wallet app that doesn't support Bitcoin in-app purchases. As long as you use Apple's in-app purchase system for all in-app purchases, you should be fine.

Here's the problem with these "decentralized storage solutions":
Regular people are far less reliable than most cloud-storage providers. Their hardware is cheaper and more likely to fail, their consumer-grade Internet connection will likely have very slow upload speeds and will probably drop the connection several times per week, and they're more likely to go offline for extended periods of time without any warning.
Compare this to a multi-million dollar data center maintained by highly skilled IT professionals, connected to business-class Internet connection.

I don't think so.
If we eliminate taxes, employers are going to cut the income tax portion out of your paycheck and keep it for themselves. They will justify this by saying "you are still going to be taking home the same amount of money, so we aren't really cutting your paycheck".
This all seems fine, except now that those services aren't paid for by taxes, you will have to pay them out-of-pocket. Your income will stay the same, but your expenses will dramatically increase.
EDIT: plus, forcing each of these departments to collect their own revenue is inefficient. What happens if I don't pay my fire bill? Are they going to send out a debt collector? Is the dispatcher going to have to make sure I'm paid up before dispatching the firefighters? It eventually adds up to more work for the department, and more work = higher cost.

Until Bitcoin either fails completely or becomes the worldwide standard currency, there will always be people saying "it will go up eventually, you just wait!" and "Look, yet another Bitcoin exchange bites the dust. How much longer until this thing dies for good?" The game isn't over until you can declare winners and losers.
Instead of looking at it in terms of the "final outcome" of Bitcoin, ask "where will Bitcoin be 5/10/50 years from now." You will find that more people will pick the middle ground, rather than the two extremes.

I sort of disagree with this. 
I would argue that fiat *is* (artificially) scarce, but it's not finite. There isn't an unlimited amount of money in the world. More can be created, but not by anybody. Money has to be scarce, but it doesn't need to be finite.
It's true that the federal reserve has the ability to manufacture money out of thin air, but that's in order to keep the value of the US Dollar stable. Instead of representing a fixed percentage of the economy (as in Gold and Bitcoin), money should represent a fixed unit of value.
As economies grow and shrink, the value of finite currencies (like gold and Bitcoin) must grow and shrink with it. This leads to volatility. In the case of fiat (like the US Dollar), the supply of money can be increased (or decreased) to match the growth (or shrinkage) of the economy, thus keeping the value of a single dollar stable.

Ease of use is one thing, but much more important is it's perceived value.
The value of an automobile is immediately obvious to a layperson. Being able to travel long distances in a short amount of time with little effort is extremely valuable.

... So they would ban apps that support Bitcoin for in-app purchases, not Bitcoin wallets. This is already their stance on in-app purchases with US Dollars. There are tons of banking apps in existence today that allow you to send money.
The only time the in-app purchase policy applies, is when you're buying something that *enriches the app itself*. Amazon, Target, Walmart, Valve, and a host of other retailers all support buying things with credit/debit cards, and Apple doesn't keep a dime of those transactions.
The reason Apple dropped the hammer on Dropbox, Kindle, and Microsoft Office is because those apps were offering in-app purchases that enriched the app by adding content (e.g. buying books for Kindle) or functionality (e.g. upgrading your Dropbox or Office 365 plan for more storage space).

I don't like this analogy that Bitcoin is like the internet "back in the day."
In my opinion, it's much closer to BitTorrent – an open, decentralized protocol that sits *on top of* the internet. Like BitTorrent, Bitcoin benefits illegal activities more than it does legal activities. We already have tons of infrastructure to support online transactions with visa and MasterCard. And if you're a vendor that wants to sell goods and services online, you can always accept payments with paypal or google wallet. Let's face it: For lawful purchases, Bitcoin doesn't really bring much new functionality to the table. Very few (if any) lawful businesses accept Bitcoin exclusively, and those that accept Bitcoin *at all*, typically exchange their money back into fiat immediately after the transaction is completed.
But like BitTorrent, this technology is a *huge* benefit for those who want to break the law. Fraudsters, drug traffickers, and money launderers are better able to do their business with a digital monetary system that has no oversight.
The way I see it, Bitcoin, like BitTorrent, will stick around for a long time to come, but it will never make it into the mainstream for legitimate businesses.

Easy. Paper money is scarce because only one entity has permission to create it, and that entity is closely watched (at least in America). Scarce resources are inherently valuable.

In my opinion, this isn't true about governments in particular, it's true about large organizations in general (both private and public). The government just happens to be a very large organization.
Also, I find it laughable that you think this solution is more efficient than the status quo. Right off the bat, you have *two separate independent teams* investigating the same crime scene, instead of just one. You've already doubled the amount of work necessary.
Plus, any cost savings you might have seen by cutting down on "government waste" is just going to be replaced by a profit margin.

The video you linked to starts by describing how a society with government-provided food could never conceive of a society with free-market food supply. "How would we be sure everyone is fed?" The implication is that we live in a society with free market food supply, and we don't rely on the government to feed us, so why can't we live in a society with a free market justice system?
But he conveniently ignores the fact that even in a free market society, the poorest members of the community *still do* rely on the government to feed them, in the form of food stamps and welfare. If you remove the government support structure entirely, those people would have to steal food to feed themselves, beg for money, or starve to death.
The same applies to this free market justice system. What do you do if you cannot afford to buy into one of these defense programs? In the example, if the alleged aggressor (Bill) didn't have a firm to represent him, Dawn Defense would be incentivised to declare him guilty regardless of the evidence that they find, because they can bully him into paying either way.
Or worse, what's stopping Dawn Defense from tampering with evidence in order to make their own client appear innocent? If they get to the scene first, they can gather all the evidence they find, and clean up the crime scene. Bill's firm wouldn't have access to the same evidence, because it was already collected by Dawn Defense.
This doesn't seem any better than the current system.

I know cheap cell phones exist, but *that cheap*? 
Plus you need to have a pretty robust data network to be spending your time on YouTube of all sites. Even in European countries where wireless data costs are much lower than the U.S., you still have to pay around $20 per month for a decent data plan.
Let's say someone is "fortunate" enough to make $0.25/day. That's about $7.50 per month, for everything they need to survive (food, shelter, and electricity to charge their cheap phones). I suppose you could live on a diet of rice and water for a few dollars per month, but that leaves them with barely any money for everything else.
It would take them years to save up enough money for a $25 phone, and then pay for the costs of electricity and data on top of it. I doubt they're going to blow it all on YouTube videos.

@_date: 2013-11-10 16:38:13


I don't think this is necessarily true.
Bitcoin is designed to be scarce in order to prevent against inflation, however there is nothing to guard against *deflation*. In economies with rapid deflation, people are less likely to spend money, because it's a better investment to simply bury in the ground for a year. When people don't spend money, the economy stagnates, and people start getting laid off.
Think about countries that have suffered from extraordinary inflation due to excessive money printing. A single loaf of bread costs trillions of Zimbabwe dollars. If Bitcoin destined to become a global currency, it will have the exact opposite problem: a single loaf of bread might cost 1 trillionth (0.000000000001) of a Bitcoin.

Whenever there's a discussion about what you can spend Bitcoin on in this sub, there's almost always someone who jumps in with "you can buy all these gift cards with Bitcoin, ergo you can buy any merchandise from those establishments with Bitcoin." Of course, those gift cards are typically sold in denominations based on some other national currency (dollar, pound, euro, etc), so it's basically no different than exchanging Bitcoin for cash, and immediately spending that cash on a gift card.

The problem is investing.
If I'm an investor in an inflationary economy, I'm incentivized to invest, because my money will lose value if I simply bury it.
In a deflationary economy, I would only want to invest if I can get a higher ROI than I would if I buried my money. That means whatever I invest my money into would have to outpace the rate of deflation. I'm less likely to invest money in anything, and more likely to sit on my hoard of bitcoins.

I don't think that's entirely inaccurate. I'd wager that the percentage of illegal transactions that occur in Bitcoin is far higher than cash.

If investors are more reluctant to invest, it raises the barriers to entry for new businesses seeking funding.
Hiring employees is also a kind of investment. By hiring someone, you expect to get more value out of them than you are paying (either by reducing costs or increasing revenue).

Sure, that sounds small, until you realize that's 4% of *the entire block chain* during that time.
That would include people cashing in/out, and shifting Bitcoin between their multiple wallets.

Apple does not make a low-end smart phone. All their phones are $400 and up (starting with the 2 year old iPhone 4S). Meanwhile, you can buy an Android phone for $200 or less. This is a big deal in non-America where people usually pay for their phones up front instead of having them subsidized over 2 years.
McDonald's sells more cheeseburgers than any other burger company in the world. Not because they taste the best, but because they're cheap.
If you only look at people willing to spend $600+ on their phone, iPhone more than holds it's own. People who have $200 or less to spend on their new smartphone simply don't have many options.

It sounds like shopify is mostly for small businesses who don't have the resources to implement their own online credit-card processing solution. I'm sure shopify scrapes off a small percentage of revenue as payment.

Perhaps if we were robots, this would be true. However, humans are really bad at comprehending very large and very small numbers. Assuming the value of Bitcoin continues its upward trend, a single bitcoin could be worth thousands of US dollars. You would be buying a Big Mac with ฿0.00152 ($4.56 / 3000).
This is purely a psychological problem, but if Americans can't even commit to Celcius over Fahrenheit, how on earth can they be expected to work in thousandths of a bitcoin on a regular basis?


Not true. At least in my case (which I expect is typical for majority of users), my paypal account is linked to my bank account. I don't need to "exchange" my money into paypal bucks, I just need to enter my paypal password, and I can spend money right out of my bank's debit account.








"Yeah, it sucks now, but you just wait! It's going to be really great in the future! You can take my word for it!"
That's hardly a defense. I understand that bitcoin might get better in the future, but until that day comes, I'm not holding my breath. So far, all I've seen is a so-called "currency" which behaves much more like a stock to be traded for short-term gain.
Bitcoin won't get widespread adoption until the price settles down, and the price won't settle down until it gets widespread adoption. It's a catch-22.

I was under the impression that this was the *whole point* of Bitcoin. It's constantly billed as the "currency if the Internet". It's called Bitcoin, not Bitstock or Bitinvestment. I constantly see people on this subreddit dreaming of the day Bitcoin will replace the US dollar.
Saying Bitcoin fails as a currency is like saying Xbox fails as a game console.

First of all, Steam doesn't allow you to buy games with Bitcoin directly. You have to go through a third party to get a steam key. Buying Steam games with Bitcoin is less convenient than paying with a credit card or PayPal. Like I said, you're just adding extra steps for the novelty of using Bitcoin.
As for VPN: I hope you realize this is far  from being a typical everyday purchase. I'm willing to bet that over half of the US population don't know what VPN is, and of those that do, the vast majority either don't use it, or don't pay for it themselves (e.g. I use VPN at work, and the company pays for it).

How they choose to handle donations is their own business. The don't have to pretend be unbiased about it.
The actual articles, however, are generally taken very seriously.
It's like if a gadget reviewer uses mostly Apple products in their personal life, but tries to be objective in their reviews.

Har har, very funny. I get it, we're talking about the US Dollar in the same way that people talk about Bitcoin.
But in truth, the dollar didn't change value by any meaningful amount. You can't buy twice as many Big Macs as you could yesterday. Your spending power did not double overnight.
The value of any currency is dictated by the amount of goods and services one unit of that currency can buy. The value of bitcoin is fluctuating wildly.
It would be like saying I'm travelling millions of miles per hour, simply because the earth is hurtling through space at that speed.

Your analogy is a little off. Airplane food is expensive because it's the only food available while you're on the plane. There is no competition. I don't think there's a single country in the world where you can buy an iPhone but not an android phone. Apple does not have a monopoly on smartphones, and the people who are spending $600 on a new phone tend to buy iPhones instead of comparable Android phones.
My point is that if you want to gauge consumer preferences, you have to segment on spending power. There are very few Ferraris on the road, because most people cannot afford them, and there is nothing preventing them from buying a Honda instead. However, if you asked people whether they would prefer to have a Honda or a Ferrari, most people would probably pick the Ferrari.

If you spend or earn money, you're participating in the economy. I'm not sure how you came to the conclusion that fewer people are able to participate in the economy.


Could you elaborate? How does this cause a recession?


And the shareholders would then take that money and re-invest it in something else due to the fact that inflationary currencies slowly lose value. By re-investing the money, they're keeping the economy strong.

Maybe you won't do any any horrible things with that information, but by using unedditreddit, you're enabling someone else to.
Unedditreddit does not query query Reddit's servers directly (because reddit would probably block it). Instead, it looks over your shoulder and sends snapshots of the pages you load to their servers. It only works if there's a huge community of people supporting it.
I think it's disturbing that a community like that puts so much value on privacy, finds it so easy to intrude on the privacy of others. Please respect the user's decision to delete the comment and just move on.

I'm starting to worry that Bitcoin is becoming synonymous with illegal activities, just like BitTorrent did. The way I see it, the only area where Bitcoin is uniquely able to perform better than traditional credit/debit cards is in the black market.
Visa is accepted just about anywhere you can buy digital goods, and most people already have a Visa card (or similar). If you want to pay someone directly, you can use PayPal. The only place you *can't* use visa is in the black market, which is where Bitcoin fills the void.

This is not meant to be an instructional article on stealing Bitcoin. Instead, this was more of a report on all the different ways Bitcoin has been stolen in the past.

How is it that you're able to buy Bitcoin, but don't own a credit/debit card? You would at least have to have a bank account somewhere, right? Isn't it standard practice to have some sort of plastic card tied to that account?

Look at BitTorrent. It's a perfectly respectable technology whose name has become synonymous with piracy. Yes, people still download pirated content through plain old HTTP connections, but BitTorrent is **predominately** used to illegally download copyrighted content. That makes it an easy target for politicians looking to reduce piracy.
Here's an anecdote for you: while I was living in a college dorm room, the school would not let you access the Internet unless they could scan your computer for BitTorrent clients first. If they found any, they would force you to delete them before allowing you to connect to the Internet. 
The big difference between cash and Bitcoin is that cash is a well established and well respected currency. It can already be used to buy any good or service. That makes Bitcoin unnecessary. If Bitcoin becomes known as "the currency that's used to circumvent the law", it would not be difficult for a politician to outlaw it because it doesn't serve any purpose that couldn't already be served with cash.

That's all well and good, but you won't be able to spend Bitcoin on anything if nobody accepts it.
Getting back to my BitTorrent comparison: when I was living in the college dorms, they would not even allow your computer to connect to the network before they could scan it for BitTorrent clients. If they found one, they would force you to delete it before granting you access. BitTorrent is a perfectly respectable technology, but the fact that it's predominantly used to illegally download copyrighted content has led to these extreme measures.
I'm worried that if Bitcoin becomes the "currency that buys illegal drugs", it won't gain any traction (or worse, will be actively fought against like BitTorrent is). The only way it will grow to become a respected form of currency is if there are legitimate things to buy with it (like Reddit Gold).

The problem is that Bitcoin doesn't offer many practical advantages over a credit/debit card, *except when you're buying illegal goods and services*.
The Internet was (and is) one of a kind. We put up with the bad because there wasn't any alternative. It wasn't trying to overthrow some pre-existing and widely used technology; it was a brand new concept.
Money isn't new. We've been buying things on the Internet long before Bitcoin was invented. Bitcoin doesn't solve any common problems that haven't already been solved by Paypal, or the banks.

Because I like to be entertained, and I am currently in a position where I can spend money on those things without feeling guilty.

How do you explain fluctuations in the economy? Recessions, depressions, etc?
All it takes for the economy to go in the toilet is for people to spend *less*. Yes, you will always buy things you *need*, but what about everything else you *don't* need? Movies, video games, theme parks, expensive designer shoes, etc.

Well you still have to link your bank account to some Bitcoin exchange right? *Someone* has to have access to that account.
Regardless, you're still going out of your way just to use Bitcoin instead of your bank card, even if it's because you simply don't like giving out your bank card number (which seems a little bit paranoid to me). My point is that's uncommon behavior. I would imagine most people would simply give Valve their bank card or Paypal account.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:49:37
I think you hit the nail on the head.
Bitcoin is designed with checks to prevent inflation (transaction fees and ever-increasing mining difficulty), but nothing to prevent *deflation*. It's designed to reward early adopters and no one else.
That makes it a lovely get-rich-quick scheme, but also a dreadful candidate as global currency.
