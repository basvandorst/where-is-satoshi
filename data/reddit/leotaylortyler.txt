Join a cloud mining scheme if you are wanting to mine, many of them look to be pretty dodgy pozi schemes and at best simply won't make you much ptofit

 If you get an s9 u need like a evga 1600 power supply. Or bitmain power supply if your 220v. Really depends how cheap ur power is overall. Tbh you should just buy the coin when I bottoms out. An s 9 will be like over 100+$ a min this many places. 
If you really want to mine, then I’d recommend: you can get a cheap second hand z9 mini on eBay. It will give you a sense of what mining is like. Without major hindrances or noise. Should only be a couple hundred and it only pulls 300w. 
I did this as a solo miner, my challenge was really adequate power hence I ran into losses, not too long I got in touch with a cloud Mining company which generates my ROI while I sleep.

Btc and other cryptos can never replace banks. They're intangible!

I'm still optimistic bout how btc will shoot up very soon. Bear and bull is just a season. Btc will get better. For now I just keep buying awaiting a boom!

It is safe to buy and sell but outrageous charges. You can check out cashapp

I don't agree it to be laudable. Can bitcoinmoms keep to the trend of ups and downs of btc. This is a sole store ma'am.

It's our prayer, more and more countries accept btc.
