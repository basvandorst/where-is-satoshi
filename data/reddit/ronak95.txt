It's not about using btc in the terrorist area itself
It's about buying weapons in western areas

Yes that's a good point..
I appreciate you took the time to explain a bit your point of view.

Yeah maybe the fundamentals are better. But for what reason should the bitcoin be worth that much? Why shouldn't any new coin replace him at any coming time? 
I looked around a bit on the sub and it really looks like more and more people or institutions are going into bitcoin that's really interesting. 
More like 9 year bull market at least for  euro guys like me
Sure 0% made it possible but nothing wrong with that iam hoping for a crash soon

Bahaha calling it a bear market. It's a bubble that exploded and Only survives on dudes like you who won't acknowledge their losses.

I am following the bitcoin for years. I had one in 2016 and was dumb enough to sell it early 2017.
Overdid it a bit with my comment but it's my honest opinion that bitcoin isn't in a bear market the big hype for btc is just over. I mean it's lacking value. Stocks can be in a bear market cause the economy slows down 
What about bitcoin? It has no value in it that can come back like a driving economy
Sorry for my bad English
