this is just not true. Many software developers are using the blockchain for a variety of applications. 
Some are even using bitcoin so stop spreading fud and misinformation. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:47:14
Fearmonger. Are you scared of the government? Do you live your life in fear?
If they banned cryptocurrency then cryptocurrency price would skyrocket. How did banning prostitution work? how about gambling? How about when the government bans anything it creates even more scarcity. 
You clearly know fuck all about economics and you live your life in fear.

Ok try to remember that only 5% of Americans are really aware of bitcoin. Watching AA videos is great for us, but the average person isn't saavy enough in my opinion to negotiate mentally the things he says. Sometimes he is a little over the top with it. I agree with him but it's easy for us to be "in our bubble".
If you are the average mom living in murica you probably think bitcoin is the devil. It's like marijuana was about 20 years ago. There is a stigma and no amount of reason will get through to some people. It will take time + inflation+ orange coin go up before these ppl get "woke". 
I feel for OP. 
Sell some shit for btc or work for btc. Figure out how to mine. There is opportunity for everyone in bitcoin land.

I have stocks and bonds and 401k too but at this point if you're not diversified into crytpocurrency as well you are missing out on the best gains around. Yes it is volatile, risky, and you could lose everything. All investments carry a degree of volatility, risk, and you could lose everything. That's life. 
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:29:52
Because that makes zero sense. 
Risk can be managed - don't invest more than you can afford. 
No Money? You have *no money* and you are knowledgable about bitcoin? I seriously doubt it. 
"Bullish on BTC but prefer other assets". So you don't diversify into assets you are bullish on? Found the brilliant investor.

This is good advice. I can't say that im a model investor my any means, I just got into crytpocurrency. I have most of my retirement still in my 401k but there's a real chance my crytpocurrency gains could eclipse my 401k this year. I also have about 1/5 of my investments in actual stocks. They do slightly better than SMP500. Any of these investments could tank. That's why I don't quit my day job.

If a big enough crash happens people are going to start buying in again like crazy. There will be violent spikes in the price and multiple chances to sell/buy and the market will correct.

Gonna be tough now that the Chicago futures market is on board. People with big money are investing in btc.

@_date: 2017-12-16 13:54:26
your comment is not remotely related to the video. RP is coming around to crytpocurrency. He even said block chain technology. Give the guy some credit for at least learning that shit. Most people that age think Bitcoin is like Monopoly money.

@_date: 2017-12-17 16:56:30
Yeah I mean if you are the kind of person hoping to sell out big and take all your earnings to a different market than that's pretty fucked. Btc has the chance to revolutionize our currency system. I believe in block chain as a secure transaction method. There is so much undiscovered value here still. I think so anyway. Why would Chinese companies spend billions on mining operations if btc was truly undervalued? My guess is once we truly discover the value of one btc it will be Mars, not moon math.

Someone is not necessarily a neonazi because they believe in conspiracy theories. 
. I wish we could all get along. You will find a lot of libertarian types into Bitcoin. A lot of libertarians believe in conspiracy theories, or in my case, find them entertaining.  
I believe it was Benjamin Franklin who said it is the mark of intelligence to be able to entertain two conflicting ideas at the same time. If you truly have an "open mind" as most liberals claim. It is possible there is some truth to at least some conspiracy theories. It's just a mathematical possibility.

@_date: 2018-05-15 13:22:49
Honestly I believe that when Satoshi and/or his team built bitcoin they did it in such a way as to create something that would last in value. This thing that is growing, this meme that is bitcoin is not going anywhere. It's not just a tech thing, it's a cultural and economic phenomenon that has been created. Bitcoin is the daddy of all the crypto and we all admit crypto is valuable. 
There will only be 21 million bitcoins. Many are lost forever all ready. It isn't like beanie babies where TY just created more, or tulips that wither and die. It is a meme that will never die. Even as people laugh at it and scorn it when the price is down, when the price is high there is a mystical aspect to it. With many true believers dedicated to trading their fiat for it every month when they get paid to billion dollar businesses making their stake in bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies and blockchain as a whole. 
The meme is only growing and the tech is improving in my opinion but fuck I been wrong about a lot of shit so don't fucking listen to me. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:03:05
We are still in an awareness phase. The average person doesn't know a bitcoin from their own ass.

Dawkins defined the meme as a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation and replication, but later definitions would vary. The lack of a consistent, rigorous, and precise understanding of what typically makes up one unit of cultural transmission remains a problem in debates about memetics.

I'm young, I believe in Bitcoin. Will we see another insane bullrun? maybe not this year, but if there is one in crypto BTC will break ATH as a matter of mathematic probability.

that's exactly what the market is trying to decide. 
IMO volume is very good but we want to see buyers and sellers arguing the price upwards. Until the sellers are a bit more reluctant to let go of their coins we are staying at these levels or moving downwards.

Your argument is bad. You calling me ignorant while not giving any evidence for your position. 
I don't care about your .05 btc you have saved up. PoW is the best system we have _yet_. Until there is real reason to change it is only a risk, and an attack vector for centralization. If you don't understand that I can't help your ignorance.

I love Bitcoin but ETH, LTC, Doge, xlm all have their place of value imho. Obviously no where near the marketcap of Bitcoin proper but if Bitcoin can do certain things well why can't others do other things.  Eth is more programmable on-chain, LTC is basically a testnet for Bitcoin, Doge has meme power. xlm is useful for a variety of reasons.

Rule number 1: Don't invest more than you can afford to lose completely. 
Rule number 2: If you don't hold the private keys, you don't hold the crypto. Don't keep more than you are comfortable losing on an exchange. Use a hardware wallet like a ledger S or Trezzor for long term storage. 
Rule number 3: Do your own research. Don't trust anyone else to tell you how to speculate, invest, or whatever you call trading your fiat for crypto (or any stock/asset)
Rule number 4: Keep emotion out of it. don't FOMO or FUD. 
Rule number 5: Don't be greedy. Remember this cardinal rule of investing 101: Bulls make money, Bears make money, Pigs get slaughtered. 
These rules are not necessarily in order but they are.

Most bitcoin miners are using ASICS that cost thousands. Mine ethereum, ethereum classic, Monero, Decred. You are not gonna compete for blocks on the bitcoin blockchain with a 400 dollar miner. 
I'm a bitcoin maximalist pretty much across the board but I'd recommend you do your research into some other cryptos, you should be able to make money mining something else.

Why not both? I have faith in my countries economy I own several stocks, etfs, mutual funds, 401k, IRA, etc. BTC/crypto will help save that economy someday or already is saving it in my opinion. 
The way I see it, and I'm probably fucking wrong so someone please tell me how but the way I see it:
Crypto is this highly volatile, unregulated marketplace which allows for greater accessibility, volatility and risk. The stock market is slightly less risk but has it's own potential pitfalls. ETFS, Index funds, IRAs 401ks are just ways we have built into the system methods of mitigating risk. Sometimes these fail for the same reasons a lot of cryptos fail. Greed, corruption, etc can destroy any asset. 
Why not put 5-10% into a tech you believe in can help save the global economy?

It means the bitcoin ecosystem is insecure. Bitcoin itself is rock solid but economically speaking tether price and bitcoin price are linked in some ways. the same with bitcoin and ethereum. if ethereum drops so will btc and vice versa. because once these coins gain enough market cap they become tied to one another. Especially with the nature of the tether/btc relationship.

I like it. First off OP: I commend you for bringing up a controversial and yet very relevant topic to our sub. 
Second, before I get into my reply, I'd also like to reprimand you for being kind of a dick in a lot of your comments on this thread. Don't be a dick, don't feed the trolls. 
Ok onto the topic at hand:
How would Bitcoin be affected under Yang administration? Well let's start with the premise that UBI passes. 
A lot of people seem to think we would be hit with massive inflation, that's one possibility but then btc will surely moon.
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:22:00

If Bitcoin doesn't succeed no alts will either. They are alternative to Bitcoin for a reason. Bitcoin is the standard. Sure you can use other virtual currencies but they are not trusted in the same way as Bitcoin. If Bitcoin loses its trust why would anyone trust flavor of the week altcoin?

Which is funny to me as someone who's not investing more than I can afford, couple hundo into BTC every paycheck. This is money that I can afford to lose. I put the same into stocks. I've had to watch my stocks go down before too. This is all part of the game. If you don't have a day job then I could see this being difficult. You can't live off of investments or speculation unless you are a real pro. 
I live off of marketable skills that my employer pays me for. I speculate in crypto and the stock market because long term I think it will pay off. Maybe this will all go to shit but if you follow rule  and don't invest more than you can afford to lose wtf is the big deal? Money is an illusion.

Because it is THE cryptocurrency. Go to coinmarketcap. Look at dominance charts. until btc &lt; 25% it will control all crypto prices. 


It has, and it continues to evolve. I don't have the time or the crayons to explain. DYOR.

Do you know how taxes work? You declare your income and pay your income tax. You can lie if you want to but I wouldn't recommend it. 
If someone buys my house with BTC I better damn well claim that income just the same. In fact it's even easier to trace by the govt because the blockchain is public and immutable.

Haha the thing at least my excuse is that it is a learning curve. People go on Reddit having done no research, having no clue what btc is and then they cry that it doesn't do X. 
X being:
Instant feeless tx &lt;- zomg dae Nano-&gt;, Dapps, industrial blockchain, or other reason you need a SQL database and don't understand basic computer science. 
I get it. It's snobby to ask people to do fundamental research in (Current Year).

Bitcoin is not anonymous. That is a common misconception. Bitcoin transactions are *easily* tracked by government agencies and financial organizations.

Thing is these increases haven't been roller-coaster .gif worthy. These gains seem slower, more incremental than the previous runups from the 3,500 - 3,750 levels. 
the hype is those large jumps, whether bullish or bearish leaps in the market are cause by extreme sentiment. You either hate bitcoin or you love it. I like to look at it that way anyways. I like seeing slower steady increase. It means to me that these are still buy levels. When you see large drops or increases it is *scary* to a guy like me.

Actually you did.
Paper trading is what you are referring to by the way. 
You should do your own research before coming here and being rude.

Rule number two is don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Which in your case sounds like zero.

Mycelium wallet is pretty dope. 
Poloniex, Kraken, Binance deserve credit.  
Cash app, even Robinhood though only a custodial wallet has allowed for less friction and more liquidity for people looking to speculate or get involved in some way. 
Lightning labs, btc core devs, bitmain, I mean there's a lot of innovators who are also "hated/loved" because of our tribal nature.

This is so bad for the space. 
These fucking retards (Not you OP) seem realize that we NEED women in crypto, but they don't know how to act. Women see shit like this as completely absurd. OP, you realize this, I realize this, but people in this space are soooo fucking autistic they push women out of the space. 
Look, I work in IT, ok. STEM in general has trouble attracting women for the same reason. It's not that men don't want women around, it's that they don't know how to act! 
This shit is soooo fucking childish. We have to move past CSW, Roger, allll the figurehead worshipping including Vitalik and CZ and all the rest. 
That is one reason why Satoshi was anon. He knew figureheads kill the project. He knew drama pushes people out. 
No more drama pls. ty. good post OP.

Sure is. Grab the popcorn and a comfy chair and meet all the loveable missfits. 
I'm a bitcoiner, but I see the value in alts.  I hold some Bitcoin Cash, some Stellar Lumens, and of course some Dogecoin. 
I believe Bitcoin will remain dominant. 
Competition is good for Bitcoin. It forces the further development and helps to identify flaws in the system. 
Like any system there are complications and some things will always have to be fixed through trial and error. 
Some people refuse to set tribalism aside this ecosystem is no different than other communities, Catholic vs Protestant, Crossfitters, vs weightlifters, Java vs C 
See, some people will always think *their* way of doing things is the *right* way. In this case everyone believes crypto is the future but no one can agree which. 
However if you really look into it you will find Bitcoin is soooooo dominant it's not even close. Other coins will always be the "alts". I believe for one good reason:
Any competetitor that overthrows the king will be an immediate target for the next usurper and chaos will unfold. Any project worth a nickle knows this. It is like a snake eating it's own tail. One day it may happen, but that would be bad for the whole environment in my mind, and I think most of my "tribes" mind.

@_date: 2019-04-19 14:21:28
Ok, sure, SOME TAX. 
WTF is the system we have? Do you pay attention to the posts here? do you know where your money goes? 
Maybe the reason you don't understand this mindset is because you have done zero research on opinions that oppose your own? 
I know your position. I understand the liberal mindset. I was liberal for my younger years. 
When you get your paycheck and you see that over 30% of your money goes immediately to wars you don't agree with, are you ok with that? Do you get a paycheck or do you still live at home? Honest question. 
Maybe you are ok with that money going from your pocket to someone else's. Maybe you look at the national budget and defense spending and go "yeah I like that, I'm ok with endless war". Maybe you look at the "non discretionary" budget. Which means "Fuck you we'll spend this where we choose", and you go "yeah I like that, the government knows how to spend my money better than me, and they don't have to tell me where if they don't want" 
Maybe you have worked a government job and seen the fraud waste and abuse that occurs on the reg and you go "meh, not a big deal, everyone is wasteful".  
Maybe you know all this already, and you enjoy lighting piles of money on fire. 
I choose to believe you are ignorant of these facts, not malicious, or that you are a paid troll.
Edit: For the record I have always paid all taxes and tried my best to obey the law in every sense of the word. I only say this as a freedom loving 'merican. Taxes are bullshit. We have a 1st amendment and no matter how stupid you think that idea is I have the right to that opinion. You have the right to yours.

@_date: 2019-04-17 18:01:04
sometimes there is also a password depending on the wallet. 
Seed phrases, like all backups, can store any amount of bitcoins. It's a concerning idea to possibly have enough money to purchase the entire building just sitting on a sheet of paper without any protection. For this reason many wallets make it possible to encrypt a seed phrase with a password.
The password can be used to create a two-factor seed phrase where both "something you have" plus "something you know" is required to unlock the bitcoins.
This works by the wallet creating a seed phrase and asking the user for a password. Then both the seed phrase and extra word are required to recover the wallet. Electrum and some other wallets call the passphrase a "seed extension", "extension word" or "13th/25th word". The BIP39 standard defines a way of passphrase-protecting a seed phrase. A similar scheme is also used in the Electrum standard. If a passphrase is not present, an empty string "" is used instead.
Warning: Forgetting this password will result in the bitcoin wallet and any contained money being lost. Do not overestimate your ability to remember passphrases especially when you may not use it very often. 
Edit: I wanted to add: I hope you get your coins!

Nobody outside crypto gives flying fuck about Roger, CSW, or even Satoshi.

Exactly, concentrated FUD attack to suppress the price as the billionaires see their stockpiles of USDs becoming more and more worthless. 
BTC represents everything scary to the already super wealthy. btc and it's ecosystem are going to bank the unbanked and bring true market equality to the world. That is terrible for rich white boys like BG.

This is finance we are talking about, not social policy. Please understand I do not fucking like Vladmir Putin. Fuckn A' amirite Murica? 
This is good news for cryptocurrency tho and look: all this globalist propaganda wants us to hate eachother. Seriously this is what we are fighting. I believe bitcoin and blockchain will actually bring the world closer together. Globalists want us trying to kill eachother all the time. The people of Russian and the people of America have no qualm with one another. It is our  govts that cause real FUD about eachother to give themselves more power. Fiat currency is part of those control systems.

It will happen and has happened for years. They do the same with gold and silver and have for hundreds of years. "They" isn't some conspiracy. It's just futures trading and how it effects markets. 
It allows "whales" to manipulate the market both up and down. Ultimately the value will shine through, imo.

Pretty sure China has engaged in more global economic warfare than USA. They have been at it longer, and they go harder. It's a fact. 
Real war too. Watch what they are willing to do to their own people to win the war. They are a one party system, that party is the Communist party. Their currency is a communist currency. Labeling it as "commy"  is only offensive if you are a giant pussy aka "liberal socialist" / bernie supporter.

@_date: 2019-09-14 15:18:25
This is neat. I hold XLM and BTC and haven't really messed around with LN yet.

Dude that's amazing help. I learned a lot from this comment. (Not OP)

I'd agree with you but then we'd both be wrong.

Also don't invest recklessly.

Hey, don't call me insane just because I'm arguing that you can't criticize this because you haven't made better products. 
A football fan eating nachos criticizing Tom Brady is pathetic.

I mean, that's just embarrassing.

@_date: 2018-12-21 18:37:01
Just need to get some of my doge off poloniex and I'll be 99% off exchanges. Really what would be the point of holding BNB and a little dust on a HW wallet. 
over 85% of my bags are btc so don't go criticizing me for hodling some eth and shitcoins @_date: 2018-12-17 18:04:51
So what if that's the case?
Gotta problem with people making free economic decisions to speculate? 
Why do you care if people burn their money, it's not yours to tell them what to do with it.

The miners start hodling more and more makes the price go up. Right now they are still making ez profits at this level.

Yeah most of the fudders can't accurately describes the Bitcoin protocol or network. Great job calling these charlatans out for what they are: ignorant, disillusioned, and petty.

Not really. It's the estimated time of the next halving.

@_date: 2019-05-01 17:03:32
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:23:39
Ok but ask yourself, are you going to panic sell when it drops to $400?
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:39:37
Most of em panic sold. We are past capitulation. 100k here we come. 
@_date: 2019-05-25 12:22:30
Sorry noob question but RBF?
@_date: 2019-05-02 20:24:47
So badly. Like, this is completely unwatchable shit. I'm sorry. I wish it weren't.
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:07:22
Well you could speculate it will drop a certain % based on previous ATH, ATL patterns. In which case I think a lot of traders anticipate a bottom at ~2,500 dollars. However I think there is always a lot of randomness when it comes to price speculation. It could be a large percentage off of that perhaps as low as 1,500, perhaps as high as 2,800. Perhaps we've seen the floor? Perhaps BTC will go to 0. Who knows? Oh, I guess that was your point. Well made. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 22:10:52
You are another one of these all caps people. Your dumbing down the whole conversation with internet screaming. I don't engage with that sort of behavior. You have mental health issues. Seek help.

Ugh. I am literally getting dumber reading the shit you write.

It takes time for this information to cycle into the zeitgeist. Most people are not paying any attention. 
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:09:48
Is it realistic? I suppose. Whoever is buying bitcoins now doesn't seem to want that to happen though. 
3k bitcoin would be an incredible opportunity.
@_date: 2019-05-02 13:40:14
this was a real use of your time.

The first games for Windows were solitaire and minesweeper. They were made to helpful people find bugs and get used to the system. 
Blackjack is perfect in my opinion. It's just one little game dude don't take it personally. Make something better.

Expectations of price rise are mostly hopium. Look at that chart. You think a couple of nerds pulling their BTC off of exchanges is a drop in the bucket?
The big players are moving millions of dollars in btc a day. Your 5000 Satoshi are insignificant, strength in numbers and all.

People who believe in Bitcoin but still believe people like Milo deserve to be deplatformed and banned are the worst kind of hypocrite. 
They pretty much demonstrate that they are 100% only in it for the money. They don't understand the politics or the tech.

Nope. Dead cat bounce. Zoom out. This isn't even a bump in the road.
