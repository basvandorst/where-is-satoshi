What I didn’t want to do was type that in over and over again and on top of that is fun to watch.  Basically I’m too lazy to type “X BTC to USD” so I spent an entire evening coding instead, putting a picture on here and then answering responses.  Basically I’m a misguided moron.

Yes.  I wouldn't mention to anyone that the giant heat generating noise maker you have plugged in that's sucking 1350 watts every hour is a money making venture, or you are likely in violation of your lease.
@_date: 2019-09-23 03:20:53
I really didn't think you were, and I deeply appreciate the time you've taken to answer my points.  I was only bringing up the privacy issue to point out that, from my perspective as a business, it's not a big deal to be transparent.

Another app to check out.  I like apps that in no way connect to any actual wallets.  That way you could even just enter speculative numbers if you wanted.  "How much would 6.15 bitcoin actually be right now?"  ($63,923.35)

Having to rekey it all the time is what I am too lazy to do.  :)

There’s also always room for one more in the elevator, but sometimes you just shouldn’t.  :)  I appreciate that list.  I clearly missed several apps and therefore my google-fu is weak.
@_date: 2019-09-05 14:30:44
If you mean the best strategy would be “buy it then just sit on it” then I agree, constantly watching it is wrong.  I find myself staring at my app now like it was a goldfish in a bowl though, and that brings me enjoyment.  What’s it going to do now? Oh look, it went up a little!   Now it’s bsck down.  How fun!
@_date: 2019-09-08 03:24:02
Oh, it's insane.  The end result is a net increase of around 472% in three years.  On the other hand, I've read several of these technical analyst guys that confidently predict an increase of 10X in three year cycles and that's a 1000% increase.  But like I said, this is just a thought exercise and when an actual thinker comes along (like you) and correctly points out details, it benefits everyone don't you think?

I agree

It'll rebound.  Just sit tight.

I’d have written an app anyway, for the experience of connecting to the APIs and to match my goofy sense of style.

Sorry. “Sci fi”.  Silly auto correct.

It also does altcoins and so forth. Presents lots of info.  I have a feeling they’ve put more than the 4 hours in that I did.  ;)
@_date: 2019-09-05 14:27:07
Not syncing wallets or exchanges is an absolute, in my mind.  Doing that just has the feel of putting out a welcoming mat for hackers.  Like putting a sign in your front yard that says “Gold inside”.

The word "gracing" made me smile.

I have a fascination with funky 1950s sci do hardware.  It was always both clunky yet simple.  Is also why I tend to name projects goofy things like “Bitcoin Value Master 5000”.  It I end up tossing it up to the App Store it’ll be a freebie and of course in no way competition with any of the great pieces that have been pointed out in this thread.   I’ll keep you posted.
@_date: 2019-09-05 14:42:24
I just skimmed the article, you likely read it in more depth than I did.  From what I saw it said you enter the seed words “on startup”.  Does this maybe mean when you initially set the thing up? Entering them every time you turn the thing on seems cumbersome, and there are comments being made about its streamlined ease of use.
@_date: 2019-09-05 07:02:40
So a little background here.  I am a programmer by trade (I also own an arcade called 1984, but that isn’t overly relevant).  I decided to jump into the whole cryptocurrency thing since 1) I just enjoy reading about things, 2) I keep hearing the phrase “blockchain” and it was time to get up to speed on that, and 3) some outfit in the same building as my office has put together some crypto coin offering.
Obviously I’m fascinated with bitcoin now, not only as a currency but as a technology, and I bought in, a little, at about 9400.  As it turns out it’s fun to check the current asking price and see how things are going and so on…. Except that I began to get a little nervous about leaving my balance just sitting there in Coinbase, so I moved it to Electrum on my desktop.  Then I got a little nervous about THAT and ordered a hardware wallet, which should show up in a day or so.  But this causes a problem!
Without my balance sitting in Coinbase, there’s no easy way to check what my bitcoin is actually WORTH.  I can watch the trade numbers go up and down, that’s fun, but I have to pull out my calculator and type in a bunch of numbers to get what my USD value equates to.  And being the greedy bastard that I am, I want to know that amount.
I found a link to an online calculator that lets you type in your amount and it automagically shows you what your current USD value is, but you have to type the numbers in every time you want to check.  There’s no instant gratification to it.
What I wanted was an app that I could type my current bitcoin amount into, and it would pull down the latest trading numbers and show me on the fly what my current USD value is.  The next time I launched the app I wanted it to remember what my bitcoin amount is.  I did NOT want it connected to any kind of wallet, for security reasons and lazy reasons.  Better still if I could watch the fluctuations, like a ticker.  
I looked around for an app, and while I found a number of ticker apps, there didn’t seem to be anything that did what I wanted.  So I wrote one.  The screen shot is it running on Xcode’s iPhone simulator.  
My questions are: would anyone else be interested in this?  Should I take the time to submit it to the Apple Store, move the code over to Android, etc, or should I just slap a development provisioning profile on it and let it only live on my phone?  I also have a desktop version running, both in OS X and Windows.  Would anyone be interested in that?
@_date: 2019-09-22 05:29:25
Right.  I understand about the shifting addresses.  And I assume that once I transfer any of the BTC out of that wallet (for example, to trade to fiat) that constitutes spending and therefore I'd be constantly printing new QR codes.
As far as privacy, that's not an issue.  Actually transparency is preferred, as since I am a business I can assure you that the "Revenuers" are about an inch up my ass at any given moment and if it looked like I was hiding money that would only cascade into annoyances.  I'm not wanting to offer BTC payments as a way to get around any fiat or government entity, I'd just like to do it as a way to show support for it and as a convenience for any customer who might want to pay in that manner.
@_date: 2019-09-22 05:07:03
As as add on question to this, and I KNOW I said that I didn't want anyone to walk me through this...  I just am asking this in the hopes that you'll answer and thereby encourage and enable lazy behavior on my part...   Don't wallet addresses change every time you use them?  That would keep you from, for example, printing out a QR code and just having someone scan to that, right?

Hey!  What do you know about my aunt that you aren't telling me?

“consolidation triangle”.  Lol.  I wish I was as good at making up BS terms as these TA guys.
@_date: 2019-09-06 02:20:34
Thank you for that cogent thought.  I couldn't seem to think of a good way to state that idea.
@_date: 2019-09-22 04:48:35
I should probably point out that I'm not the only guy that takes money.  There are employees, and two locations.  I would expect that sharing a wallet in that circumstance would be problematical?
@_date: 2019-09-05 19:26:14
Wouldn't have "saved" my evening.  My evening was wonderfully productive.  I learned about some CoinDesk APIs, played around with a tool for creating line graphs on the fly, kept my mind sharp and at the end I have, if nothing else, this fun little toy I can continue to play around with.  AND to boot, the helpful members of Reddit pointed out some great apps for me to look into.  As well as your google trick.  Wasn't a waste at all.

Hey, if btc goes up to 100k then you’ve just profited $900.  You’ll be thanking yourself.

I'll adopt it, if someone can make it as easy as swiping a card or taking a $10 bill.

That makes sense.  I don’t have access to one of those.  Thanks for pointing that out.

Not to pick apart a carefully crafted reply that took you time and energy to post in response to my question...  BUT....
What I see here is a bunch of links for an e-commerce solution which I am not.  I am meeting physical customers at a door.  The next link is a POS related link which then is dismissed because bitcoin "doesn't work well for  for point of sale / retail" and requires the Lightening Network which no one is using.  Then a bunch more links on how to integrate it into my favorite CMS (again, not useful to me) then a Shopify link (not useful) and a bunch of other random links.  The only thing I get out of this is "Bitcoin isn't ready for use in a retail environment".
There's lots of evangelizing and prognosticating on here about how fiat is dead and Bitcoin will be the world's currency and so on.  I just don't see it.  It doesn't seem like it is suitable on even a rudimentary level for face to face transactions and that's what fiat is used for a bazillion times daily.  I can see the value of Bitcoin and I see the potential.  And at the moment I think it's a great store of value.  But not being able to USE it...  kinda drags me down.
@_date: 2019-09-05 08:19:34
Interestingly I looked at this app and didn’t realize / understand that it allows the user to enter balances and use that to check value.  It doesn’t seem to be mentioned in the description but some of the comments hint at it.  Thanks!
@_date: 2019-09-08 03:27:03
Giving this one an upvote.  I'll be passing this article along to a few friends to read.

Looks like the guy just lost about $13,000.  You have my sympathy.  
As someone new to the bitcoin “thing” and doing my best to examine it with a hopeful yet skeptical eye, the comments in this thread regarding security measures concerns me as in order for bitcoin to ever become mainstream currency, it’s going to have to be at a minimum as easy to access and use as a debit card.  Yes, debit cards get “identify thefted” but people don’t sit around saying things like “As a general rule - exchange/web wallet &lt; desktop SPV &lt; mobile SPV &lt; mobile SPV + personal full node &lt; HW wallet &lt; HW wallet + personal full node &lt; SSS/multisig cold storage or multisig of HW wallets with personal full node” to each other.
In order for bitcoin to become ubiquitous its going to have to be something that my mother could use.  As it stands right now bitcoin is much more like a stock with a quirky, dangerous ability to spend pieces of it as opposed to a currency.  
Exchanges and hardware wallets and paper wallets and crypto keys and pass phrases and trusted downloads and running personal nodes and all that are great points of excitement and satisfaction for techie types, and looking down on neophytes for doing something as silly as running a software wallet on windows might give one a sense of superiority, but in order for bitcoin to be accepted as currency it needs to be something that a single parent with 3 kids and two jobs can use with having to spend time thinking about it.  This concerns me.
