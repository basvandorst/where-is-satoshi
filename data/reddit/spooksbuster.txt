Yes, you simply don't understand anarcho-syndicalism.
To them there is no problem with having a special skill and trading it or whatever. The problem would be if instead of having a skill you owned a factory and gained money off what other people manufactured in it. In that last case they would use force to give this factory to the people who work in it.
You should remember that anarchism isn't about not using force (it never was) or respecting Ayn Randist morals (if you want anarchist point of view on morality you should read Stirner), it's about abolishing hierarchies.

Except that words do have a fucking meaning and capitalism is defined as an economic system based on private property rights, not as free trade and association.

He is an anarcho-syndicalist, and it doesn't implies leader. Stop making straw mens.

Go ask what they think about Marx and what they think about Rand.

The existence of a class system is still considered a valid position in sociology and it was supported by many people before and after Marx (some of them who were clearly not leftist).

That works if you put the link :

Can you use the actual definition first and then maybe seek what's the actual reason why capitalism is criticized by the left (ie. read Marx or Proudhon or just any fucking book that's not written by Ayn Rand).

Have you ever read his works?

I wouldn't really label Jeffrey Tucker as an authority figure.
