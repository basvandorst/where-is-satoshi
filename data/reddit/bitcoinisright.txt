Wrong! You want to control the network! They don't want to be controlled by you.

The fact is the miners compromised with core one year ago with Hongkong agreement, but core broke it.

That's not what they think, that's what will happen based on the bitcoin protocol. No rule is violated, it's fair play.

I only heard the voice from one side, so could you elaborate on how miners broke the agreement?

Both sides sit together one year ago and made a compromise (Hong Kong agreement) to work together, unfortunately Core broke it and miners no longer trust them anymore:

Don't speak for everyone, you don't know everyone and you can only speak for yourself. Bitcoin is not yours, and you are never in control. Your hobby to run a full node on an ancient hardware is least important to bitcoin.

I only learned FlexTrans recently. Maybe its developer is more qualified to answer your question.
