Coinbase created a working exchange in a few years, why would it take you a million years? Honestly you just said you have a brainbut you strike me as one of those people who think they are smarter than everyone but all they do is just downtalk others.

You hear that? Thats silence in the wind here in Doer City. Everyones over in Complainer City protesting god knows what again.

Pfft, you have bitcoins left?
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:32:38
No I haven't. I heard about this shit happening last week. Then I tried to withdraw my bitcoins to another wallets but it wouldn't let me because I had to get verified. They wouldn't get back to me since.
So...we're just all cool with it?

Fair enough, thank you.
Can you also tell me why btc eth and ltc transactions wallet-to-wallet wait so long to be confirmed?
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:38:15
Like most of the internet.

Im a newbie, so please bear with me. My tx went unconfirmed for days until someone here on reddit asked me for the ID and instantly it got confirmed. I wanna be able to do that myself to confirm my own transactions.
I know it might be a sliding scale of how fast i can confirm but i at least want the minimal of that ability. To do that, it seems like a full node wont help, will running my own miner help?
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:42:52
Does this give as much payout as mining?
(Sorry, crytonoob)
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:48:31
Does mining give steady payback in fractions of a coin, or kind of like gambling until you hit a motherload of coins? Im a cryptonoob
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:39:41
Ah, i wouldnt mind running one, does that give me the ability to confirm my own transactions?
Also does thinking about mining like the lottery in which you have a chance of getting X bitcoins correct?
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:03:22
What i mean to say is its taken me 3 days for a transaction to be confirmed. Is there a way, say mine myself for me to confirm these transactions?
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:04:16
Chump change like $1/day? $1/month? Or per year?
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:36:27
Without suggesting that this might be where you're located, can you name 1-3 countries where depositing to coinbase is free?
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:34:04


I pay 2.99 every time from my bank account.
@_date: 2017-08-29 02:43:32
What are the benefits of running a node.
I asked this question here before but will it help confirm my transactions?
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:44:05
Well since i dont trust exchanges to hold and i like to trade but transactions confirmations take 5 days (even though everywhere i read said 10 minutes, and my transaction didnt get confirmed until a kind person here on reddit offerred to confirm it for me), if having a node will allow me to confirm "my own" transactions then i would do so.
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:38:57
This was a blockchain.com-to-coinbase transaction. I flipped out because TWO transactions took longer than 2 days.
With GDAX how long to GDAX-to-wallet transactions take?
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:14:28
And sorry im total noob
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:12:32
Say i just buy the $400 thing from Amazon, whats the magnitude i can expect? $1/mo? $1/year?
