More realiabilty and security.... I don't know the history of either being a new user and just wondering if one is regarded as better than the other.

Is gambling against the terms of use?

Fun little game!

Excuse my ignorance but why would people need money out of the banks? Will the banks keep the money if the country defaults or what? 
@_date: 2015-06-02 23:53:12
Cool idea!

A faucet that gives out 1 Bitcoin every 5 minutes 😜. In all seriousness I like what moonbit.co.in does with a clock that progresses the amount you collect. Or zebra faucet where there's a multipler effect if your lucky. Somthing a little diffrent than just put in adress and collect.

This faucet has been giving like 2000-5000 bits an hour that's y I'm skeptical 
@_date: 2015-05-04 19:00:24

Yea fee was minimal, but shouldn't it be complete with 7 confirmations? Sorry I'm really new to all this not sure how everything works. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:05:25

@_date: 2015-07-08 18:51:29
Ic thanks for the reply!

Worst case scenario I just wait correct? Transactions don't get cancelled after a certain time or anything like that?
