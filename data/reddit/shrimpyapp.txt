Thanks for commenting! I would be happy to answer any questions you have about the article. It's a pretty simple strategy which has been used for decades by the traditional financial space, so there is really nothing scammy about it. Happy to help any way I can!

All backtests and analysis happens after the fact. This is a strategy which has been used by institutions for decades, so it's widely accepted as a strategy which reduces risk and can increase returns.

This isn't really hindsight. Institutions and investors have been rebalancing for decades. There is nothing new, it's just being adopted into the crypto space.

Yes! You can always use [Shrimpy.io]( to create your own portfolio similar to an ETF. All you need to do is select your assets (or create an index) and let Shrimpy automatically rebalance on the interval that you designate. That could be daily, weekly, monthly, or whatever fits into your strategy. Shrimpy is free to use, so I think it's a great place to start. 
You can find a lot of information regarding Shrimpy on the blog here:  [ 
Let me know if you have any questions! I'm happy to help.

Thank you for sharing!
I think you might misunderstand the point of personal asset management. It's not simply about trading, but about tracking, allocating, monitoring, growing, etc your assets as well. For example, "[Mint.com]( is considered personal asset management and that is more about understanding how you are spending your money more than anything else.
The digital asset market is going to be huge in the future. At some point, we expect every physical asset, stock, etc to be digitized. Saying that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency of value is not thinking long term. In the long term people will need to manage thousands of assets digitally and it's going to be a nightmare if we don't have solutions that properly help people manage their assets the way they want. 
This comment highlights the misunderstandings many people have about the market. They are thinking about today, rather than what we will need in the coming years. I agree the market is in a rough patch right now, but I'm still trying to think long term and understand what people will need in a year, two years, or five years from now. Personal asset management is certainly one of those things.

Thanks for the question! I'm happy to share more of my thoughts.
The shortage comes from what we need to take crypto from the current state to global adoption. Right now users need to manage their own funds in hardware wallets, trade manually on exchanges, move funds from wallet to wallet manually, and so on. Walking someone new through the process of managing their own cryptocurrency really demonstrates how confusing everything is. 
To further crypto adoption, we need better tools. We need tools that help you better monitor your assets, better track and trade your assets, and better guide you through the process of maintaining a diverse portfolio. 
I mentioned it in my other comment below, but we need to start taking the future of cryptocurrency seriously. Maybe Bitcoin is the leading asset today, but dismissing a future where everyone will have a diverse portfolio of assets is unreasonable. We will digitize stocks, bonds, mortgages, loans, and so much more. It's not a fantasy, there are people working on these things already.
When it comes time for us to manage all of these assets, we need tools to do it. Today, we don't have those tools. 
Let me know if you have any other questions for me! Happy to continue the discussion.

Thanks for asking! The list isn't really intended to rank from best to worst or anything like that. The order was chosen based on what felt like the most logical since you need a hardware wallet first, then an exchange before you can manage your portfolio, and so on. I hope this helps!

The rating is based on "Available Cryptocurrencies". This includes the quantity, quality, and selection of assets. When compared to the other exchanges we've reviewed, Bitstamp has the smallest selection of assets. This rightly earns it a 1 star. Please let me know if you have any other questions!

Thanks for the comment! You can see by following the link that it is not an ad. It's charts for different assets across every exchange. Let me know if you have any questions!

Of course! Here is an extensive guide to everything you need to know about cryptocurrency trading bots. Please let me know if this helps!

Thank you for the comment! This is a strategy which has been employed by institutions for decades. We aren't talking about inventing some new strategy. This is threshold based rebalancing, far from a random strategy. 
While we can make a case for all historical backtesting to be useless because it doesn't predict future performacne, we can also see that threshold rebalancing has outperformed HODL consistently year after year. It's not just one period. Bull markets, bear markets, sideways movement, they all demonstrated threshold rebalancing has outperformed hodling.
Let me know if you have any questions!
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:06:26
Not even a little bit.
@_date: 2019-06-06 00:39:27
Happy to discuss if you have any questions! Our team along with many other teams have studied this strategy for some time now and everyone has come to similar conclusions.
@_date: 2019-12-07 00:08:45
I'm sorry, could you clarify what you mean? There is nothing currently wrong with the website.
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:34:15
Yes, the allocations will be even after rebalancing. Thanks for asking!
I would like to clarify, this is just for the study. Of course, you can rebalance to any custom allocation that you desire. If you want 70% BTC and 30% LTC (For example) in you portfolio, you can rebalance back to those percentages after each rebalance. It's completely up to you. For the simplicity of the study, we chose to rebalance to even allocations.
You can find a number of other studies here though: 
Some of these look at different allocations to compare performance.

Great to hear! Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions. Shrimpy has executed over $350M in trades when rebalancing portfolios, which makes it one of the largest trading apps in the crypto space.
@_date: 2019-04-26 00:35:37
There isn't a way to do it in the ledger live app, but you can certainly pair it with the Shrimpy app ( You can do this by having a small percentage of your funds on an exchange of your choice, then inputting the ledger balances as "Cold Storage" in the Shrimpy app. 
I wrote up an article on how you can do this here: 
Let me know if that helps!

Great question! Essentially everything we offer isn't available in CCXT. Shrimpy is more than just data and trading endpoints for exchanges. 
We provide the entire infrastructure to execute trades, store data, manage users, link exchange accounts, store data from historical balances, unify trade / order book websockets, and provide historical data. None of these are available in CCXT since you would need to manage your own infrastructure yourself, store your own data, provide your own user authentication and storage, normalize your own data, manually rate limit trades, and so on.
Please let me know if you have any other questions!

Thank you for the information. I appreciate you figuring this all out!
@_date: 2019-09-22 05:01:21
Yes, always to be sure to check the source code. You can find the python library which is referenced in this post here:

Great question! Instead of using pip install, you can also manually install the code from github.
I would also like to mention that Shrimpy is a service trusted by tens of thousands of crypto traders and has executed over $600M in trading volume. 
You can join the Shrimpy Developer Telegram, browse the content published by the team, and more to see the company is legitimate. 
Please let me know if you have any other questions!

Great question! Yes, CZ has stated the funds will remain available for a long time. That means you can transfer the funds to a new exchange or to a personal wallet whenever you are comfortable with the change. Let me know if you have any other questions!
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:01:55
What is a scam site?
@_date: 2019-05-21 05:07:03
I'm not entirely sure what you are referring to. Could you please clarify? The recent hack of which ecosystem? We aren't aware of any hack.
@_date: 2019-05-07 05:51:51
Great suggestions, will be sure to check them out!
@_date: 2019-05-03 23:54:48
We appreciate you saying so! We've been moving fast since we first started developing Shrimpy and don't plan on stopping. There is a lot of work to get done before the bull market is in full swing. We look forward to having you join us for the journey!

Better than less diverse portfolios. Let me know if you have any other questions!
@_date: 2019-05-09 23:18:44
Nope, the assets were randomly selected when constructing the portfolios. So, we didn't evaluate just a single portfolio, but as many possible portfolios as possible. We found the median portfolio performed 22% better than hodl at a 1 hour rebalance period.
