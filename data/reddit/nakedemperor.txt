A review from: 
Version v1.1.0
Review Version 2016080201
The wallet list is based on the personal evaluation of the maintainer(s) and regular contributors of this site, according to the criteria detailed below.
These requirements are meant to be updated and strengthened over time. Innovative wallets are exciting and encouraged, so if your wallet has a good reason for not following some of the rules below, please submit it anyway and we'll consider updating the rules.

    Prevents downgrading the firmware
PASS Firmware is not downgradeable (nor upgradeable)
A few more thoughts on Opendime
Opendime is a new and innovative device which does not share some of the characteristics of traditional hardware wallets. One difference is the lack of ability to backup the device (the feature might be considered a bug in this case). My concern with the lack of backup is that there may be uncorrectable failure modes (temperature? static discharge? x-ray? over voltage? physical shock?) that average users are unable to anticipate and Opendime is unable to correct. Opendime is sometimes compared to a bearer bond, however the average user is likely to be able to anticipate and understand the physical failure modes of a paper based bearer bond better than an Opendime.
I'm also concerned that it would be extremely difficult, or perhaps impossible for even an expert to identify a modified or counterfeit Opendime. A rogue Opendime that chooses predictable keys would not be able to be identified until a post mortem after the device is "unsealed", which could be too late to recover funds.
With closed source software, I can only speculate on other attack scenarios, and not easily nor independently, confirm or deny hunches. For example, in an effort to prove knowledge of the private key for an address, the device can be called upon to sign short chosen plaintext messages. This is unlikely to expose a vulnerability, but it is difficult to confirm. Likewise, a "first owner" of the device, one who seeds the private key, does so using a known entropy seed and a known serial number. The only part unknown to the first owner is the entropy provided by Opendime's internal random number generator which is closed source, leaving some speculation as to the actual amount of unknown entropy in the private key. The "second owner" (one that "unseals" the device expecting to be presented with the private key) has no way to verify in advance that when unsealed, the device (authentic or counterfeit) will indeed reveal the private key.
I suspect that these issues will likely either become less important (perhaps solved) or more obvious as time goes on and Opendime gets into more hands and more usage scenarios are discovered.

You still face the challenge of exchanging fiat for the fiat token. This will still likely be a regulated entry point and we're back to the same system we have today.

You certainly can boil it down to a couple of sentences. Here they are:

3. Self-Defense: Use tools like Bitcoin to help you protect your life, liberty and property from those individuals that do not respect them.
Will we ever achieve a perfect world? Of course not. That is still no reason to give up trying.

Perhaps we should define our terms:
Attacker: someone who aggressess upon the life, liberty or property of another.
Attacked: someone whose life, liberty or property are being aggressed against. 
If this is a "political bias" then I am guilty as charged.

Yes, a poor choice of words used for convenience. A more precise definition is "those who think they can control the uncontrollable."

Umm...bitcoin has already succeeded.

I'm glad you are advocating for equality. I have no income. Please send me half of yours so we can be equal. Here is my bitcoin address: 1HF7EcMX5u3cMBeo4NBeN7vym36cg7gS6v

Yes, and Bitcoin was created in a vacuum - irrespective of the world we live in.

It is a movie about the deep web, bitcoin and Silk Road.

Good points although I believe the ideology of non-violence stands on its own quite well. Bitcoin gives the individual another tool to help protect himself from the aggression of others. DPR made some mistakes but he also succeeded quite famously for years - enabling peaceful, voluntary trade between thousands of people and improving the quality of their lives immensely.

Very cool and well done!
@_date: 2015-10-04 16:19:46
That explains it. For maximum privacy stick to P2P cash trades.

Price is the market signal that tells us how much it (bitcoin &amp; Bitcoin) is valued in the marketplace.

It would be interesting to hear what their "disruptive" tactics are...

LBC doesn't require it. You voluntarily gave it up.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:42:24
Hilarious. Silly rabbit, bitcoin's not for kids.

I do feel for your loss. It only has to happen once, though, and I'll bet you don't ever let it happen again. This is an expensive "seminar" and, believe me, I've had my share. Learn and go forward.
@_date: 2015-03-05 17:18:20
Peace and non-violence are political propaganda...um, yeah.

Sounds like you may just need to wait for your MultiBit wallet to update/synchronize with the blockchain. 
To verify that the second payment was made you can go to any block explorer and check the address. Try  or

Just state-sanctioned counterfeiting...

My choice is the Ledger wallet with the seed split and stored in multiple locations:

Interesting...what do you make of this?
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:28:44
and there are many of us that would gladly pay to buy this app (or upgrade to a premium version) if you stay focused and keep delivering the goods. People don't mind paying for quality. A few bucks to protect your bits is an easy sell and is an opportunity to distinguish your product as a premium product worth paying for.
EDIT: Oh, and UASF!

Not technically false: Fiat-&gt;Bitcoin-&gt;[crypto alphabet soup]-&gt;Bitcoin-&gt;Recipient = pretty darn good anonymity.
"Cheap" is a relative term. Would you pay $100 to move millions discreetly?
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:03:39
Good point!
@_date: 2017-06-07 04:48:44
Oh yeah, that. What's up with that Mycelium?
