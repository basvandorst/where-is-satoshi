Just send your whole wallet balance to yourself with a high fee. This will also confirm the other pending transaction.

@_date: 2018-01-11 13:14:07
You can do child pays for parent. Just send another transaction to yourself, but with maximum fee. The transaction has to use one of your unconfirmed outputs as input in order to pay for both transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:16:49
You can go to  and pay the price.
Edit: And why the hell do you keep all your coins on one exchange??
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:20:17
I just paid the accelerator fee for you. Will confirm soon.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:57:07
No, there is no route. Alice would need to have a channel with Carol, then Bob could send to Carol with his existing channel (by routing through Alice).
Even if Alice had a channel with Carol but only with 0.9 BTC, the routing would fail, because not enough coins to route the payment.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:32:05
Yes, thats what I paid.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:47:48
Yup. I paid with bitcoin cash, my transaction is already confirmed. So yours should confirm when the pool finds the next block.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:20:48
Only for bitcoins that you prepaid in advance by locking them in a lightning channel, including paying the high bitcoin fee first in order to open a lightning channel.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:17:23
Could someone calculate the probability of successful routing? 
This also depends on the amount being sent, so a table with amounts 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, ... would be good.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:15:45
Bigger blocks is the only currently available scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:19:54
Small blocks force people to leave their coins at centralized exchanges due to high fees.
Even with lightning you have to pay the high fee once a month to open a new channel, if you monthly buy coins.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:42:44
Core devs dont work on LN at all. LN will never be integrated into the official client. There is no such development code or anything available at all.
LN will never happen, its a way too complicated setup.
All LN development write a completely **new** software. 
If LN would work, then all existing bitcoin wallets are for the trash (for LN usage), because LN is a completely new design of a wallet, plus it must doublicate the existing bitcoin wallet functionality in combination with LN. LN is total crazy. Stop hoping for it.
The first thing a new user must always do to use LN is to pay the high bitcoin fee to open a LN channel. LN is not worth to bother with. It can impossibly be a replacement for cheap fees with bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:11:35
People usually get a monthly salary, so they need 1 bitcoin on-chain transaction per month at least. If they now do 5 transactions per month, what have you won? An amazing factor 5 in capacity, hooray. Better just increase the blocksize to 5MB.
In addition, there are so many cases where you need more on-chain transactions: no route, insufficients funds in route, people going offline forced to close channel etc. It is still totally unclear as of today how exactly routing will work.
They claim LN can increase capacity by factor 1 million and more. Thats impossible. LN is not worth it. It might help in some specific use-cases, but it impossibly a replacement for simple on-chain scaling via blocksize increase.
Go show lightning to your friends. The first thing they must always do is to make a slow expensive bitcoin transaction and lock-in coins prepaid in order to maybe use lightning, if they get lucky to find a route.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:26:25
This has nothing to do with scaling. They plan full wallet segwit support with 0.16, but we all know that segwit only increases capacity a little. Its not a long-term solution at all.
The truth is that there are no plans from core to increase capacity any further. 1 MB base-blocksize forever.
@_date: 2017-02-28 14:20:34
But how did the hacker get access to the system in the first place? Must be either exploit or inside job. In any case, another hacker could use the same method again, and steal at least the hot wallet. Its not clear if that hole has been fixed.
@_date: 2017-03-08 12:24:12
So 95% of all node-operators do like high fees, really?
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:14:43
Then the hub needs a shitload of coins to lockin. And keep them all in a hot wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:32:08
The point is that it will never work, because the merchant needs to lock in 1000$ for every customer, and keep all those coins in a HOT wallet, so that he can act as a router for other peoples payment. So if 1000 people buy a coffee, the merchant need to lockin a Million dollar right there. The design is nonsense, there will never be a working LN.
We need bigger blocks to solve scale. Your is argument is segwit+LN. But segwit is malleability and not scale. And LN will never exist. So you have no argument to not raise the blocksize. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:38:12
Please. LN is an impractical joke. It will never work. If I pay a coffee, both me and the merchant need to lock 1000$ in a channel, because if you dont lock that much at least, its not worth it. The point of a channel is to be reused. With rising popularity, you have to pay 20$ fee to open a channel. LN is such a nonsense, we need a solution NOW. And the only simple correct solution is raising the blocksize. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:14:59
Segwit increases capacity only one time by factor 1.7 and then never again. It is very complex and the capacity increase is only a side-effect. Cores argument for not increasing further is centralization.
BU is simpler and allows for basically unlimited capacity increases.
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:05:35
Sigh. Only bigger blocks (e.g. BU) solve our scalability problem. Segwit only gives minimal additional scale. (All the other long story segwit answers about the advantages can be ignored. They only lead to a confusing discussion about malleability and LN. Both do not help with scale now. )
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:03:26
And then what is your solution to get a transaction confirmed?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:35:36
Lightning will be ready in about 18 months.

@_date: 2017-11-12 23:40:43
If there is more demand for bitcoin transactions than space in the blocks, there must be transactions stay unconfirmed forever. So patience is longterm not a solution.
@_date: 2017-04-30 17:05:54
Bitcoin is limited to about 300k transactions per day. So the more demand for bitcoin transactions, the higher the transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-04-12 16:15:25
The concern is that the people behind this scam company are also in the bitcoin development lead position. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 15:44:41
I think his actual job there is to find chinese investors who are willing to pump more millions in this worthless company. 
Blockstream is just a venture capital scam company. They are not really doing anything. They only hire people and periodically update their blog with some cryptographer-blabla, so that it looks like there is progress.
They are just milking their own 72 millions, and when that money is gone, they need to find more stupid investors or they will simply declare bankrupt otherwise.
Blockstream has no business model because getting money from investors is the business model.
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:09:13
No. The friend uses bitcoin once per year. Lets say he has used bitcoin in the past, so he already has a "bitcoin account". He just does not hold bitcoin because he only uses it to transfer value.
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:17:10
Its not an edge case, its the main use case. The majority of users would use bitcoin only once per year. And they all cant use LN.
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:39:34
You will realize that I was right, when in a few years there still is no LN.
@_date: 2017-04-29 11:12:45
Warning: Usually those LN companys are just venture capital scam. They release a whitepaper with blablabla bitcoin blabla problem=scale blabla solution=LN, and then they ask people for money.
The startup mentioned here raised at least 250k 
Then they just periodically release some source code where they play around with channel open/close and make a blog post "LN is doing great".
LN is currently an easy way to raise money for startups.
The truth is that LN does not work and is vaporware. Just one example, with 100 million users, lets say 50 million would only use bitcoin once per year. Then 30 million use it monthly, 10 weekly, 10 daily. Then for those 50 million LN is useless because they dont hold bitcoin and need to make an on-chain transaction anyway. So those 50 million need 50 million ON-CHAIN transactions anyway.
I could give much more examples where you still need an on-chain transaction. 
And the other 50 million users, if everybody locks in 1000$, then there needs to be 50 BILLION dollar locked in by LN-hubs in a HOT-wallet. LN is total crazy and never works.
And if you send more than 1000$, you need an on-chain transaction again. LN design is so nonsense, vaporware.
Please do not give money to any LN-startup anymore, then all the "LN works" news will stop. Because it doesnt work and is only a buzzword to get money from investors.
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:19:33
Please name one blockstream blog-post that has resulted in a useful feature and is actually widely used by people. There is none, which is proof that everything on the blockstream blog actually is only blabla. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:25:56
The point is that you still need so many on-chain transactions. LN will not solve our scalability problem at all. This is what I want to say here. All good news about LN is just fake, because people are making money with it, by venture capital scam. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:06:16
At least I'm happy that we agree on the on-chain transaction here. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:29:13
While you are waiting for LN, more and more people are switching to alt-coins that do on-chain scaling. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 13:54:33
Open the channel yourself? Haha, you need an on-chain transaction for that.
Your second example is like if you both have a coinbase account, and then you just make a transaction in the coinbase database internally to your friend. But this has nothing to do with LN. We are talking about non-trusted transactions. LN claims to increase NON-TRUSTED capacity.
@_date: 2017-04-03 20:28:22
So assets fit in 1MB?
@_date: 2017-04-29 13:35:21
But you agree that if you want to send some coins to your friend in australia, and he doesnt hold any bitcoins, then you need an on-chain transaction for this?
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:21:36
I give up talking here, sorry. People who read my initial example with 50 million users hopefully understand what I mean. If you dont, I cant help you anymore. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 09:11:32
We want to solve the scalability problem. Segwit doesnt.
Segwit maximum doubles capacity, and we want more.
In addition segwit complexifies the source code, so that future capacity increases are harder. The one and only main reason for the controversy is scalability, with a capacity of currently about maximum 300k transactions per day for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:00:42
Awesome! Thanks for this great contribution.
I estimate this could be implemented within the next 18 months or so.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:50:29
Can you please add the reason for the split to the website?
That segwit2x supporters want to double the base-blocksize, and then explain the reasons why the bitcoin core developers disagree with this, thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:34:26
Segwit2x doubles the capacity of the bitcoin network by increasing the base-blocksize from 1MB to 2MB.
Before: ~500k transactions per day
After  : ~1 million transactions per day
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:15:22
The bitcoin network is limited to about 500k transactions per day. 
The more people the higher the transaction fee will be. Similar to why a super-bowl ticket costs 5000$.
Its limited and the demand is high.
Now 95% of the miners and a few companies (including coinbase) signed an agreement to double the capacity of the bitcoin network to about 1 million transactions per day.
But the official bitcoin core developers and owners of bitcoin.org and github/bitcoin disagree with this agreement. They argue that increasing the capacity also increases centralization, because the hardware requirements to run the bitcoin software also increases.
Now when 95% miners upgrade, there will be two block-chains. One with maximum capacity of 500k transactions per day, and one chain with double the capacity. Both chains are incompatible. The big question now is: Which chain will become bitcoin?
The other chain will become a rather worthless altcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:47:32
Just sitting on your coins is safe.
If you have 1 bitcoin now, you will have 1 bitcoin of each after the split. So you dont have to care which wins, as you hold 1 bitcoin from each side.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:06:56
That was another independent fork that has nothing to do with segwit2x. Everybody can create a fork at any time.
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:39:20
That guy was confusing bitcoin with bitconnect.
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:12:48
$2 might be a very low fee, if your transaction is big.
Thats why fees should always be recommended in satoshis-per-byte or bitcoin-per-kilobyte.

@_date: 2017-05-12 18:18:08
Its been two years and there is not even a single line of code that would add LN to the official client. How long you wanna wait? 
All available LN implementations write their own software. There is an official RFC at github/lightningnetwork. Only by reading that is enough for me to judge that the whole LN concept is not thought through at all. There are so many questions unanswered in the RFC like network topology, roles (hubs, users,..), wallet-integration. The whole economic concept of how many coins a user/hub is going to lock-in is missing completely in the rfc.
I would bet you against LN anytime. I am a developer myself, I can judge that LN is shit. I dont need other people to tell me, I can read the code myself.
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:40:33
The amount sent doesnt matter. The transaction size in bytes (or kilobytes) is the only thing that counts.
So before sending, the wallet you use should show you the transaction size. With that information you can calculate it. I recommend using electrum as wallet, it has built-in fee calculation. And it supports rbf (replace-by-fee) and cpfp (child-pays-for-parent) just in case you need to increase the fee after having sent.
@_date: 2017-05-08 02:01:50
Segwit is at 36%. So you believe that 64% of the miners are evil?
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:11:58
- update to the latest version of electrum
- right-click on the transaction in the history-tab
- click on "Increase fee" if available
- otherwise look for "Child pays for parent" and click that
- really make sure you add a high enough fee this time
Other people can only see the address (public key) on blockchain.info, but not the private key.
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:57:00
I am talking about Integration directly INTO the official client.
@_date: 2017-05-08 16:14:27
The proposed solutions are too complex. If you just increase the blocksize, you dont need a new address format.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:13:25
All 30 addresses were all yours.
Do never enter your private key on any site (like blockchain.info).
@_date: 2017-05-13 03:30:01
It doesnt matter why they are doing it. Backlog is still cores fault, not a particular miner.
They could do it for profit (asicboost, reduce orphan), which is part of bitcoins design to be a greedy miner. Developers must assume that all miners are total greedy.
Even if they just do it because they are pure evil, developers must always assume that there could be such miners around.
If a miner with 20% hashrate can cause a problem, then its a bug in the software and the developers fault. Bitcoin must work just fine as long as the majority of miners behave honest. If the software doesnt work fine, its a bug.
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:49:35
If they can force a 1MB-limit on the user, it is not decentralized.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:02:02
Preferences -&gt; Edit fees manually
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:03:21
In a bitcoin transaction you often send change back to yourself. In that case the sender can also do child pays for parent.
In electrum, just do this:
   
- update to the latest version of electrum
- right-click on the transaction in the history-tab
- click on "Increase fee" if available
- otherwise look for "Child pays for parent" and click that
- really make sure you add a high enough fee this time
If this doesnt work you got unlucky and cant do child pays parent. In that case you can only try an accelerator 
Otherwise you have to wait until your transaction drops out of the mempools and resend it with a higher fee. But its dangerous as you need to ensure to double-spend the intial unconfirmed transaction.
Otherwise you might send the coins twice.
@_date: 2017-05-08 14:08:41
This is so bad.
They invent their own encoding (bech32) and introduce new addresses with it. This means that every single wallet-software must bother to implement their new address encoding.
This is significant technical debt for very small benefit. He is also the inventor of segwit: Very complex, doesnt really solve a problem, but still causes a lot of drama by introducing a new address format to the community.
They are only wasting our time. We have addresses, and they work fine. This is not our problem. The problem is high fees and unconfirming transactions. This proposal should be rejected by the community.
We really must get rid of this guy (Author of segwit). He only forces complex things that nobody needs upon us. Just freaking change 1MB to 2MB would have been so super simple and much better than total complex segshit and this new address format that nobody needs.
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:37:38
Update to the latest electrum version an then try right-clicking the transaction and look for "increase fee" or "child pays for parent".
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:58:52
Short-term it could get beat by "Stuck unconfirmed transaction. What should I do?"
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:59:17
Its not about visa/mastercard, its about altcoins.
Any shitcoin can have at least 10 times higher capacity than bitcoin, simply by tweaking blocksize/blocktime.
This means that people will switch to altcoins that do on-chain scaling, if bitcoin doesnt.
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:47:02
Haha. There is no code.
There would be development-code available which builds on top of segwit and justs waits for segwit to get activated. But such code does not exist. Nowhere. Vaporware. Litecoin has segwit, so they could add it, but there is nothing.
@_date: 2017-05-08 14:43:09
No I did not. A proposal to introduce new addresses at this point is an insult to the community. This is like if people are starving and then the government hands out new passports to people.
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:05:48

**Solution 1**
- update to the latest version of electrum
- right-click on the transaction in the history-tab
- click on "Increase fee" if available
- otherwise look for "Child pays for parent" and click that
- really make sure you add a high enough fee this time
**Solution 2**
If none of these two is shown in the menu, you got unlucky. Go try 
posting your transaction id on the "viabtc Transaction Accelerator" website.
**Solution 3**
Otherwise you can only hope that your transaction drops out of peoples mempool and resend it. Just copy your wallet-seed and start a new electrum wallet on another computer. Now wait if your balance is shown correctly on the other computer. If so, and if the unconfirmed transaction doesnt show, then just send your whole wallet-balance to yourself, but with a high fee. This ensures that the other transaction gets double-spended.
Now if that transaction confirmes, you can safely resend the transaction you initially wanted to send. But in any case, do not make the mistake of low fee again.
**For the future**
Ensure to pay high enough fee.
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:01:14
But you agree that LN is prepaid and that for someone who wants to use bitcoin once a month for transfering value, LN is completely useless?
In order to use LN you must lock-in funds prepaid for future payments. So go demonstrate LN to your friends. The first thing they must always do is an on-chain transaction and pay the expensive bitcoin fee.
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:03:51
The prepaid system is also on the receiving side. So a payment-hub must prepay for future funds someone is going to receive. Good luck to prepay 1000$ for 1 million users each. So a hub would need to lock-in 1 billion dollars in a HOT-wallet. And we are completely ignoring the routing-problem here. 
Lightning can impossibly end our scalability discussion. I just want to wake up people about LN, that they should not put any hope on it. Because in the media LN is sold as THE solution just around the corner. But I doubt LN will help us much.
@_date: 2017-05-13 04:07:53
Developers could implement that if a block is not full, then the next block is allowed to be a little bigger. So that the 2 blocks in summary are still maximum 2MB. But the core devs are too incompetent for things like this. This is why they will be replaced long-term.
@_date: 2017-05-07 14:24:57
Could you please post a link to such a simulation or a paper that describes a full lightning network topology?
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:04:53

Where is the simulation of LN with a realistic setup of 1 million users? 
  
Both do not exist. -&gt; LN is vaporware.
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:04:30
I managed to submit it to the viabtc-accelerator. It just confirmed. Next time dont use bitcoin anymore, if you dont know how to pay a high enough fee.
@_date: 2017-05-07 14:53:46
2 weeks was suggested by Alex Morcos, so to get better data for the fee estimator. This just shows how retarded the core developers are. Obviously you dont do the user a favor with this. A transaction should hard expire after a day or two, and then user can decide to resend with higher fee or not.
Core is coding bitcoin into the ground.
@_date: 2017-05-14 12:17:00
- update to the latest version of electrum

@_date: 2017-05-12 17:36:34
The fact that there are so many half-baked LN implementations is proof that LN is a total failure=vaporware.
Otherwise LN would be integrated directly into the official client at github/bitcoin with one simple pull request. But such code does not exist. This is totally laughable and should wake up all people who are still hoping for LN.
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:03:29
The answer is trust. Blockchain allows an untrusted setup. 
Technically you can solve all problems that blockchain solves much more efficient, if all participants are fine with fully trusting each other.
In bitcoin you dont have to trust anybody, not even the miners, you can fully verify a block by yourself, before you accept a payment.
@_date: 2017-05-13 01:49:08
If miners were allowed to create bigger blocks, then the other miners could just easily clean-up the mempool within a few blocks. 
So complain about core, not the miners. Even if there would be some evil miners, bitcoin is designed to work just fine as long as the majority of miners is honest.
With bigger blocks we would have to care shit that some pool is mining empty blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:28:35
Bad incompetent article:
- They never heard of databases-indexes. Nobody would scan that much data to get the client-result.
Just look how electrum severs work. A client simply queries by address. No bloom filters and no scanning required, just database lookups by key.
- They never heard of client/server network requests. They do their calculations with the sockets reserverd for permanent connections. This is stupid. Even a bad server can do 10000 requests per second from the network side. A highly opimized server can even do up to 1 million requests per second (from the network side ignoring database).
Just run the numbers with the assumption that 1 server can handle 10000 client-requests per second and you will see that bitcoin can easily scale on-chain. The article is written by incompetent people who have no idea on how you would setup such servers.
@_date: 2017-05-13 03:42:06
I dont know why they are doing it. But as I explained in my previous answer, it really doesnt matter.
And as for blocksize, a miner should have the option to create a bigger block, if he wants to.
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:27:27
Check if you can do CPFP (child-pays-for-parent).
If your transaction was sending some change back to yourself, then you can do it.
Enable the coin control features, and then look for an input with 0 confirmations. Now select that (and optionally another if you need more coins to pay a high fee) and send some coins to yourself. But this time add a high fee.
So you send another transaction which will pay the fee for both transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-02 09:06:20
Pieter Wuille is the most overrated developer in this community as he thinks that an insanely complex softfork for a tiny capacity increase is better than a simple straight forward blocksize increase and now he even considers introducing a stupid new bitcoin address format with BIP 173 more important than solving our scalability issue which we did not even had without him because he is the author of segwit that has only been confusing people and caused a distraction as otherwise the pressure for bigger blocks would have become so big that we would already have them by now instead we are now forced to combine a blocksize increase with segwit to get out of the gridlock caused by this guy.

Never because LN is shit:
LN will never be integrated in the official github/bitcoin source code. Such code does not exist. All existing LN implementations write a complete **new** software. 
People say thats ok because LN is a second-layer design. But this means that people need to run **2 softwares** instead of one. You still need bitcoind to watch the blockchain. 
So exchanges would need a total complicated setup with two softwares, plus they need to lock-in future withdrawals from people in a fucking hot-wallet.
Plus you have total complexity with managing channels, plus routing problems etc.
LN will be rejected by exchanges, they will just only use coins that do on-chain scaling. LN is just some  vaporware garbage.
