They seem pretty stupid alienating PayPal users (IMHO). 
Although, to be fair, while PayPal is centralized at least they have competent developers. 
Go peddle your scam somewhere else and stop trying to trick people into buying into what every competent person knows is an utter and total scam. 
You've got ONE dev who thinks he's above peer review and then on the marketing side you have Roger Ver promoting bcash with lie after lie after lie. He's using every underhanded trick he can think of from sock puppets to paid spots on CNBC. And all of it is being done to enrich himself and a small mining cartel in China. 
These people are actively ripping off and scamming good and innocent people - all so they can make a few extra bucks.  This is the opposite of what Satoshi would have wanted - to have technically illiterate buffoons hijacking Bitcoin for personal gain. 
Please go back to your bcash subreddit run by Bcash Judas and fuck off.

Exchanges are going to fail - happened before, will happen again. 
But Bitcoin as a technology, as a protocol, is what really matters and it is as strong as ever. Price is secondary and really means nothing at this point. 
If you want predictability and stability then just hold tight until 2140. Things will finally settle down at that point.

Nope, looks like you jumped the gun with your theory. 
Just came back online and it is almost exactly where it was when it went offline.

Unless you have a team of highly skilled and experienced back-end developers, a team of finance lawyers,  a marketing department, $1-2 million minimum in funding, as well as a host of other employees you are just wasting your time. 
It's no longer 2013 you can't be "Big Vern" and run a multi-million dollar exchange out of your tiny little office - there are no more "cryptsys" out there... 
The big boys have moved in with their funding so your chances of building a successful crypto exchange are about as likely as you being able to start a new stock trading platform... 
Seriously, go find a team doing what you're doing and join them because unless you got millions you aren't going to make it. At best you'll make it a few months and then get hacked for everything you've made and then go to jail.

So you feel this is a good indication that it is going to come online much higher than when it went offline? 
I've been watching GDAX non-stop for the last 24 hours and I was watching very closely up until they went offline. I did not *see* any indication that there was a huge buy-up taking place right before it went offline. 
Which means there are two possible answers. The first being that GDAX/Coinbase is watching orders come in ahead of what we are seeing "real-time" on GDAX. So how do they do it? Does the system somehow calculate when a large influx of buys are coming in? Or perhaps watch for certain people logging in who may only have USD in their accounts? 
The other possibility is that it has nothing to do with price but is just plain old technical difficulties due to a real increase of traffic. But with AWS and all the other options out there I find this kind of hard to believe... 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:54:12
Wait, are you actually mentally retarded?

Dunning-kruger in full effect. It's scary to think that drooling idiots like yourself actually think they're smart... You're so dumb that you can't even comprehend how smart other people actually are - and subsequently end up with an inflated sense of intelligence. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:56:25
This article is absolutely wrong.  
I was watching GDAX real-time and there was no crash before it went offline... It was hovering at $13,300 and everything was pretty steady. 
For them to say that it went offline due to the price plummeting is terrible journalism. 
But what should we expect from CNBC...

That's the impression I got when I was reading through his list... It was almost as if someone had went out of their way to make Hal seem incompetent compared to Satoshi... It would serve the purpose of building up Satoshi, as well as creating plausible deniability for Hal. Now Hal can say something along the lines of, "Your honor, there is no way I could have created this, I could barely understand it!"
If you think about it, making a non-existent creator is actually brilliant... There's no one to point the finger at if shit hits the fan - and more importantly, it makes this figure into a "legend". 
You also avoid the scenario where discovering his identity leads to panic because entities start to personally attack him because he had a drinking or a gambling problem... 
With Satoshi being fake there is nothing that can tarnish his legacy - he will be a legend until the end of time.

The big datacenters that are coming online specifically for mining bitcoin are opening in areas that have electricity rates of $0.01-0.02/kwh... 
The average US citizen pays .10-.11/kwh. 
Just another reason that home mining is coming to an end. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 19:08:12
Well obviously it's not quite *that* simple, but most of the miners are just plug and play with some light networking... 
Not only that, but they just said they've got a location with cheap electricity and lots of it. 
@_date: 2014-09-02 14:26:34
Those costs are easily absorbed the the sheer volume in which they are mining. These companies have electric bills upwards of $1,000,000 *a month*.
Paying several employees $10,000 per month to run the data center is really not that big of deal.... 
Did you see the recent post where someone built a 256,000 square foot mining operation in China? They're not paying rent, they're custom building warehouses specifically made for bitcoin miners...

Nope, you are wrong on that one. We're hitting the limits of the current chip size. The difficulty has actually plateaued compared to the insane increases we were seeing over the last year. 
That being said, I wouldn't touch anything from BFL with a 10 foot pole... 
We've seen only increases of only 12-15% per round recently... Extrapolate that out through Christmas and I predict that we'll be at around 50-60B.

I've got several homes lined up to heat with Bitcoin miners this winter, but I needed a way to "condense" the units and seal them off from kids and pets. 
This setup is two undervolted S1's in a single case and running off a single PSU. 
Hashes at 280GH/s and uses only ~320 Watts of electricity.

@_date: 2014-06-27 01:47:54
I disagree, those pitfalls are exactly why there should be a larger discussion about it. 
It's like most of you have just written off mining and don't pay attention to it... It's literally the backbone of the entire coin and no one seems to give a shit. 
I would venture to guess that 80-90% of people DON'T ROI, but that's usually because they are ill informed or get scammed. Both of which could be rectified by having more discussions about this and shining more light on the mining hardware landscape. 
I bought 10 S1's 45 days ago and I've already almost ROI'd fully and then on top of that I can now sell each unit for $200... 
But that's only because I've been constantly running calculations and watching prices and jumped in at an opportune moment. As others have done, and will continue to do. 
But just writing mining off as a total scam is a really short-sighted outlook.

Cable and connectors are cool to the touch, no heat at all. You have to remember these are undervolted and it's only powering 1 side which is only around 80 watts now. 
If it was in stock condition though it would be pulling 200 watts per side and the molex would be red hot and probably ignite or shut down the system. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 23:04:37
Actually, it kicks out pretty well on it's own.  
The cases have two fans that I initially used, but I've elected to remove them as they weren't really doing anything. I don't want to add too many extra fans as each one adds additional wattage without adding heat. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 19:11:46
Sorry, but I get so sick of people on here shitting all over people who actually support the network by mining.
It's as if most of the people on here are happy to see miners suffer... It makes no sense, we're the ones who secure the network so that Bitcoin continues to exist. 
 
@_date: 2014-10-06 03:13:25
Hey, condescending asshole, no it's not. 
Little farms like myself eat the electric costs and are holding their coins. 
Big 256,000 square foot farms cannot afford to foot a $1 million a month electric bill... Which means they have to sell their coins immediately to pay bills. 
Over the last year the mining trend has gone from small home operations to big "data center" type operations, this is causing a lot more selling pressure. 
@_date: 2014-09-02 03:41:28
Actually, mining on the home level over the last 6-8 months has been profitable. Back in early May you could buy 200GH/s S1's for $225-$250 and they were making you $7-$8 a day each... They returned full investment in about 6 weeks... 
Now, the S3 is Bitmain's latest miner and if you buy the S3+ at 500GH/s it will cost you .58 BTC and will only make back approximately HALF (at 15% diff increments) the initial investment before it is no longer even paying for electricity. 
All of this is due to the fact that these huge 256,000 square foot operations are coming online and they are able to operate at much thinner margins. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 20:09:53
It's been on an exponential rise from 4% just 2 days ago... In addition, it looks like this round may be sub 11 days, which means we're looking at, at least a 20% increase. 
If this upward momentum doesn't subside and drop back down in the next few days we may even get into the upper 20's... 
@_date: 2014-10-06 03:11:30
"come back"
What, you think they can just shut off those big expensive ASICs and wait for the price to come back up?? 
It doesn't work that way. 
Their only option is to just keep mining or sell the equipment for a big loss. 
But my point is that even with the price dropping significantly, we're still seeing MORE new miners coming online... It's absolutely crazy and defies logic. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 19:17:26
Come on, that's nonsense. 
And I'm not even looking for support, I'm just looking for basic human decency. 
Regardless of if you "support" miners, why the hell would you go out of your way to root against them? That's what I don't get. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 05:45:30
The picture is of a 280 GH/s "heater", but I will be putting S3's in some and those will be 880 GH/s heaters. 
The 880 right now will make around ~$12 a day in BTC the 280's are basically just making enough to get free heat. 
In a 1500 square foot home you will probably run 3 880's for a total of around 2000 watts of heating power spread out through the house. 
So 3 of them will make around $30 a day right now, but probably more like $15-20 per day once winter comes. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 05:43:37
I'm in a somewhat northern region of the U.S. so our winters are brutally cold, down below zero every winter without fail. 
Aside from that though, it's all about putting the right amount of miners in the right locations of the house. That is where I will be doing a lot of testing come winter. There's really no manual or instructions for something like this.

Best prediction from that thread: 


Bitcoin didn't catch on when it had the chance to which was back in may-June. people got way to greedy since it was basically free money for just running your computer and created a bubble.
For the past 3 month the price of bitcoin has gone down consistently and is showing no signs of ever going up. No political or socioeconomic factors have yet done anything to effect the price.
Bitcoins are still going to be used but I don't think you'll ever see it over 10$ again.

Except, let's say that you are mining at BTC Guild 2 days before a big difficulty jump and you get "unlucky" for those two days before. 
Then the difficulty jumps and you finally "get lucky" 
In this scenario you are going to make a lot less than if you were on a pool with steady payouts. 
The problem is that we are all trying to make our money back and pay for electricity. So it's only human nature to want to mine with a pool that pays us properly. 
You want to get everyone off of GHASH? Then give us concrete proof that we'll make the same amount at another pool.

Best guess is that Bitmain's new S3's came online last round for some major hashing power. Now the are gearing up to ship to customers, which means they're now taking them offline to ship. 
If they are waiting until the last moment to take them offline for shipping, we may even see more of a drop. 
But it will only be temporary as they will come back online in the hands of the end users.
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:30:12
While I agree that this is the case with every other ALT coin. Doge is different. 
It creates a lower entry bar, that is also seen as more "friendly" than Bitcoin. It's novelty and community are what makes it special. Make no mistake though, if they had no community the coin would be garbage like the rest. It's that unique combination of fun and community that gives Doge that edge. 
While I am 75% Bitcoin, I have 25% split between Doge and Redd, as I believe they have the brightest future.

It appears to be a combination of three things: 
1. S3 production is ramping up
2. Spoondoolies SP30's are coming online and mining for them
3. ASICminers just announced on FB that no one is buying their miners so they are going to just plug them all in and start mining instead of trying to sell them... They have roughly 60PH/s in power (reportedly).

If a large amount of miners decided to call it quits and turn off their miners, this could result in a difficulty decrease. 
A difficulty decrease would mean more BTC for the current miners. 
However, once the hash rate drops back down again, those miners that shut down may come back online. 
But the network hasn't seen a difficulty *decrease* in over 18 months...

Bitmain is listing these at too high of an initial price, but it's smart because there will still be people who will purchase it.

Until then, there's no way these will ROI and you will be better off just buying coins.

To say that these big farms have 3 year plans is a big stretch, considering there's just no way to predict what's going to happen with Bitcoin tomorrow, let alone 3 years down the road. 
What kind of projections did they run? Did they plan on Bitcoin being down nearly 80% from it's high last year? 
Maybe a few did, but I can assure you that many of these large mining farms are about to go belly up if something doesn't change.

If you get a PSU with a fan that only turns on at high loads, these will be almost silent. 
Undervolting the S1's means there's much, much less heat. Instead of having to get rid of 440 watts worth of heat, the fan only has to get rid of 160 watts. 
That means it runs at around 1500 RPM, nearly quiet.

Honestly, it's not as big a deal as people make it out to be if you're looking at it from a purely logical standpoint. The problem is that people naturally assume that because it's no longer a set amount that it will never raise in value. 
If you thought it would get to $1/coin when it was "fixed" that means you'd have a market cap of $100 billion dollars. Let's say it took 3 years to accomplish that cap. Well, in three years there would be a 115 billion coins now in circulation. So what is 15% more to ensure that the coin is actually around? 
From there it could just hover around $1 a coin and become a viable currency that is steady, like the USD.

I can guarantee you that if I was having a discussion about Argentine miners I wouldn't say things like "glad they went out of business, serves them right for trying to mine. Bitcoin mining is for idiots."

What about and Reddcoin's new Proof of Stake Velocity? I think he may have some tricks up his sleeve that could really benefit all PoS coins. 
The guy really seems to know what he's doing.

Ethereum coins on the move at the same time Bitcoin's price starts to plummet.... 
Coincidence? 
@_date: 2014-08-11 19:40:23
There's comments in this very thread where people say they are glad to see an increase like this... 
And it's not just this thread, I guess my anger has stemmed from many upvoted comments that bash or make light of miners as if they're not important. 
And you're very right about losing money, because if we get a 25%+ increase again it will push my mining operation from profitable to unprofitable roughly 2-3 weeks ahead of schedule.

If you could start mining with the S3 *today* then you may have a small chance of ROI after you dump your S3 on ebay/craigslist in 3 months. 
But if you have to wait until July 10th (right after the next difficulty jump...) then there's almost no way you're going to ROI, even assuming 15% jumps ever 12.5 days. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:59:39
And it still is. I purchased a bunch of S1's when they dipped down to $250 a pop about 45 days ago. Already achieved nearly full ROI and can now sell the miners or continue to run them for pure profit. 
When it comes to mining it's *all* about timing.

Which would just mean not being a jackass.

While price and hash rate do not directly correlate, they do have to play off of each other. 
I see these huge 256,000 square foot mining operations coming online and I can't help but think they can't afford to run "at a loss" for very long... $1 million electric bills and such. 
So what's going to happen? Can we continue to see the price go down while the total hash rate goes up? Are these big operations just going to eat their losses? 
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

Actually, there are a couple ALT coins that are looking to work in those spaces. Namely, POT and CANNABIS coin. 
CANN (cannabiscoin) has actually gotten a dispensary on board to provide 1 g of MM for 1 CANN coin. 
It's a pretty interesting concept. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:09:40
See this is what people don't understand. That people like you and I, the small to med size miners are almost always holding all the coins they mine while eating the cost of electricity. My electric bill is over $500 a month and right now my S3's with 92% GOLD PSU's are only making 2.5 BTC per month (and dropping)... At the cost of even $300 a BTC I am barely making a profit after electricity costs at $0.10 per kwh... 
If I was running my mining operation as a business instead of a speculative venture, then I would be forced to sell 75% of my earned BTC just to cover electric costs. 
The big operations can't afford to sit and hold their bitcoins when their electric bill is $1 million a month... And they've got investors that want ROI.... 
Something has to change because this current mining to price ratio is not going to last. We will either see a massive reduction in hash rate or an increase in price. We're about to reach a breaking point, that's for sure.
@_date: 2014-08-11 19:27:12
I highly doubt they'll be able to bring 60PH/s online considering how inefficient their miners are... The amount of electricity needed would be astronomical. 
I mean, lots of big operations are basically throwing away or bargain binning miners as efficient as AM is planning to bring online... 
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:15:41
I have 14 S3's running on high end certified GOLD PSU's and with $0.11/kwh my electric bill is roughly $500/month (just under 5000kwh per month). 
That 6TH/s pulls in, right now, about 2 BTC per month or ~$440 at current prices. 
Where you are getting your numbers, I have no idea. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:13:14
You're wrong. 
Back then those BTC were being HELD by the people generating them... The small home miners made up 99% of all the mining operations.
Right now almost all the mining operations are moving to huge server farms that are financed with huge amounts of capital. 
These huge server farms have million dollar electric bills... They can't afford to hold. 
They are selling almost all the BTC they generate and this constant selling pressure is what is keeping the price down. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:17:56
They still have to pay for a building or colocation and the hardware itself. If the price continues to go down, they may not even be able to cover the cost of the miners. 
And from there you can see the ASIC manufacturers start to fall as they can no longer get enough money for their equipment. 
We already saw Bitmain change from selling in BTC to selling in USD for this exact reason. And that was after it dropped from $600 to $400 a coin... This new recent low is really going to shake things up. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 21:29:41
The CANN developer is actively creating a real world infrastructure to support the coin. So he's actually putting together facilities to grow it and then basically giving it away for free to get it kick started. 
The difference is that someone who doesn't have money can go and buy CANN for cheap and then go to dispensary and get way more for their money. It's kind of a charity at this point. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:23:57
What's really crazy is that just two months ago the price was DOUBLE what it is right now... But the total network hash rate was almost exactly the same as it is *right now*....
That means the same exact network is running at half the revenue that it had just two months ago... 
There's no way we can keep this up. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 19:12:58
After this difficulty increase and taking into account the current prices and availability of miners on the market, there is no miner available now that will have a chance at ROI. 
More than likely we will see a sizeable price drop in most of the miners.

Oh get out of here with your FUD bullshit. I sent half a dozen different transactions over the last 6 hours all higher than your amount. I paid $2-3 as well and most were confirmed within 10 minutes and included in first block - one took 2. Your two hour claim is BS or you had a shit ton of inputs and then didn't max out your fee ratio in your wallet.

Volume is definitely going to be an issue as these decentralized exchanges get off the ground. 
You can also check out BarterDEX - it's got over half a million in volume and climbing. Although their platform uses full atomic swaps to complete the trades...

This is because the alts have gone from a trickle index of 70% to 3% over the last 2 months. So, essentially the money flowing from BTC to alts has completely stopped - which is why all the large cap alts (top 100) dropped and are now stagnant and moving sideways. 
The estimate from Tom Lee is that alts will continue to move sideways until roughly August - at which point we will most likely see a similar "alt craze" to the run-up a couple months ago. 
That being said, there are almost 1600 alts listed on coinmarketcap and it just keeps going up... There is no way 90% of these projects are viable which means most likely the real winners are in the top ~150. And even then all the vaporware out there will eventually disappear - and there are quite a few coins in the top 150 that are vaporware garbage. 
Invest in real projects with working tech and goals you think will help better the world. If you are in this for the money then you're missing the entire point of this revolution.

You can't make this shit up... 
Their narrative is that this poll legitimizes their claim that they are the real "Bitcoin". They are saying in the thread that because us "Bitcoin Core trolls" took the poll we are admitting that BCASH is Bitcoin.... because the label on the poll says Bitcoin (BCH).... 
They are absolute morons...
