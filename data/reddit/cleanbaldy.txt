What would happen if 12 years from now the cost to mine isn’t profitable and everyone stops mining new coins?   What would happen to bitcoin and the transactions?
The same for 120 years from now, when there are no more miners.  Are people supposed to set up expensive mining rigs to handle the transactions?
Wouldn’t that mean that it would need to be profitable, so every four years, BTC price would have to double?

It leveled off.  This always happens.  People get excited when it goes up, get nervous when it levels off and scream HODL when it starts to drop.
People being people.    I have no money in my less than one BTC and even I’m nervous, wondering if I should sell.  (Mined and broke even selling gear). Up until two days ago I was “Let it ride.  This is my rainy day fund!”    Now I’m sitting here saying “ I could pay off any credit cards.  Am I stupid to hold?”
I feel that way with no money invested.  I can’t imagine that feeling if I had money involved...

So, besides miners actually mining new coins, they are being paid to do transactions as well?

I am looking on the block explorer site for the Transaction ID.  
Why isn't it safe to post the Trans ID?  (curious)
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:45:08
Serious question: In 2017, high fees felt like one of the reasons BTC yanked, as the network didn't seem ready to handle a lot of transactions.
Why do we still have that same problem again?   We can't become the replacement currency if it costs 50+ sat /vB to make a transaction, when every person is using Bitcoin one day...
What happened to the Lightning Network?
I made a transaction for the first time since 2015 and it took 4 days to confirm.  I didn't understand fees and my wallet did "economy".   Four days?   A normal user won't deal with that...
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:28:05
Oh, true true.  That makes sense.  Thanks. 
Could it takes days to confirm?  Looking at the explorer, it looks like my BTC is broken up into a lot of different BTC addresses from my old mining pool and selling days!   So, instead of just one BTC address, it's listing 100+ addresses that make up the total...
Could that slow things down?   I don't care if it takes a week to confirm, as long as I didn't just lose my coins...  LOL

On the Android wallet, it does list the transfer but it's a grey dot.   I definitely have the seed for the ledger.  I just got it and set it up to store these, since my old phone vs a Ledger seemed to make more sense, for security...

Thank you for the response.  I still don't get the "how", but at least I understand the "why"...   
My old Android phone had the same BTC Wallet on it since 2014.  I wasn't sure what to do, but bought a Ledger to at least do something better than leave an old phone around holding everything.   Now I have a nice passcode and feel a lot more secure....
As for "If I wanted to sell tomorrow, how do I do that?" I still don't quite get that part.    Would I have to send me BTC to Coinbase and)or Kraken, paying another fee to get it there, then sell it through the exchange directly?    Do I have the ability to sell it directly from the Ledger?     I wish this was less complicated.   Haha
Either way, really appreciate the reply!

Someone else pointed out that the memoool for transactions is rather busy right now and higher cost transactions are taking priority over mine.   Likely due to the dip this afternoon and tons of trades going on.
My wallet added a 5.1 sat/vB fee, whivh is rather low. 
It looks like I just need to wait for transactions to clear, for mine to confirm...
I'm learning quite a bit!   So complicated, yet logical at the same time.

I haven't been into it since 2014.  I literally had the coins sitting on a phone for 5 years.   This is the first time I've transfered them since back then!
Even back then, it was a mining pool generating coins into an exchange, which withdrew them onto my phone.   There wasn't much to know.
This is the first I've moved them and go figure, with the amount of money on the line, I'm allowed to freak out a bit when it shows UNCONFIRMED without ever seeing it...
No amount of research will calm those nerves!
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:23:13
Sorry, didn't mean to be confusing there.  They are coins I've had since 2014.  The transaction was today.  
I think I figured it out.  The app had the fee set to "Economy" so I'm just at the bottom of the pile, waiting for things to settle down, so it confirms...
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:55:02
Yep, long term storage time!  I discussed with my financial advisor about cashing out now, vs. just holding.   With my situation, we both decided that I might as well hold it, even if it crashes again.    Super long term...   ;)
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:10:55
I could use some guidance/mental support.   I bought a Ledger Nano S and transfered my 2014 BTC wallet balance to it from my old Android phone that's been in a drawer for 5 years.    I upgraded the wallet and transfered the coins.
I did Bitcoin Cash first, which shows CONFIRMED (22).   So, after that worked, I did my BTC!    Both of them use a different app on the Android phone.   Both apps went to 0.00 after the transaction, emptying out locally.
On the Ledger Live app, the transaction is showing and the coins are showing in the Portofolio, but the transaction says:   STATUS:   NOT CONFIRMED (0)
I'm freaking out.   Did I just do something wrong?   I haven't moved these coins in 5+ years.   Is this normal?  I did it 7 hours ago...    maybe I just don't understand how transfers work?
EDIT:.  I think I'm good!   You guys helped me view and understand the Blockchain Explorer of my Tx ID!
You also helped shoe me what the Fee meant and how those are actually handled...
My wallet added an "economy fee", which puts me at the bottom of the list of fees to be processed.   Since the day is full of tons of transactions, the MemPool is rather full of higher fee transactions which take priority.  gave me this link, to visualize it... 
5.1 sat / vB = I'm OK, but just waiting in line!

Mine is at only 5.1 sat/vB...   But there are a ton of higher transactions getting priority!
So, it looks like I'm OK and just waiting for things to cool down a bit.

Very good point!   Being mad at not selling a dip is likely nothing vs. cashing in early and watching it skyrocket with no BTC in hand...

You say that, but what does it mean?  I don't know how. It's not automatic through the app and network?   
I just did my one and only transaction from my old Android phone with my coins, over to a Ledger wallet for long term storage.
As someone who watches BTC and still doesn't get what you just said, this is too complicated.   Fees slowing down transactions, and two networks?   I'm not automatically on LN by transferring BTC?
A lot of simplicity needs to happen for this to hit mass adoption.   
I've made one transfer of a shit ton of money and it didn't make me feel very confident waiting four days for my money to transfer, because I didn't understand that I had to pay more to get my own money from one address to another address.  I had to pay someone to move my own money?   Is this seriously how BTC is?
If I went to buy a coffee with it, would I pay $5 for the coffee and have to pay 150 sat /vB to pay?   $10 coffee...

I think I'm fearful that BTC will go to $100,000 in the next few years and I'll really regret it.   
I'm already WAY over my profit, which is awesome.   I dont "NEED" to pay off my loans now, since they're so low of an interest rate.   It would just be really cool to say "I paid them off with my BTC purchase 4 years ago."
I'd be mad in the future if I took cash now to pay off such a low interest item, missing out on financial freedom in a few years if this continues to happen.
I didn't sell in 2017/2018 crash either, which I kick myself.  I also say "How would I know it would go down to $3,500?"   
So stressful, trying to figure out what to do!   Even at $3,500 I'm at profit.   I have very VERY minimal risk, which makes this more about "What do I really need to do here?"

I bought a computer to mine alt coins a few years back, which then were sold for BTC.  I sold the computer parts for what I paid for them and now have almost a full BTC that was essentially free.
Since I have no initial investment, I have a very hard time coming up with my "when to sell".
I missed selling at $19,000 the last surge and I'm worried I'll do the same exact thing this time.   My brain tells me to sell right now...  bit I don't.  
Since I don't need the money, other than maybe to pay off my two credit cards and be at $0 (not too big of an issue) that I just let it sit there.   It's super stressful, not knowing the future...   and looking at the past, I know that I could have sold for massive profit and bought back in a year later.    Even my wife told me to sell at $19,000 last time and she's telling me to sell again.

Why is BTC so complicated?   How he heck do you sell it and get cash?

I'm really curious what this is, so I'm commenting to find out... :)
