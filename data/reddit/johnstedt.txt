Yes, segwit addresses look different and have either a 3 or a bc1 in the beginning of the address. A segwit transaction is a transaction done from a segwit address. It's backwards compatible so you can send a transaction from an segwit address to a non-segwit address.

If you follow the law then you have to pay taxes.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:13:57
No they cannot.

I don't care if it ends up being hub and spoke, still trustless.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:12:02
It is? Who is behind it?
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:11:51
Haha yeah you're right, other awesome people in the space gets a bit more. 
But let's be real, $80 extra to a block with 12.5 BTC + all the other fees then divided by the pool is not visible for any one miner.
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:30:19
$129000 + 25 tradable forked altcoins

It was mostly directed at the “shifting everything to LTC until wall is down”.  If you change actions based on a single order then you are short sighted. The order even seemed legit. This technology will change the world, a sell order isn’t changing that (-:
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:06:55
man you people are short sighted
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:22:05
Well, you still don't need to trust anyone in the network as you can publish the transactions to the network at any time. So even if you route your payment through multiple nodes you don't need to trust them.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:14:23
Will try it out!
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:51:22
Well, the bigger blocks =&gt; more expenses, at which mb should we draw the line, idk. I was in Beijing recently and took a detour to bitmain's office and a guy there was convinced that a node already were to expensive to run the any one individual. I did run a node when I lived in the west, it's not only the hardware that matters.

Yes, completely agree. I think it was messy **because** it was decentralized and would be no point in arguing if it wasn't. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:52:03
Yes, they *tried* to force it but other **actors** realized and didn't let it happen. Decentralization is system with many actors playing with their interest in mind and that is exactly how this played out \(:
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:44:46
Agree, fungibility is really the only thing that cannot as easily be implemented in layers above.   
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:49:33
No, you should not. Most of these coins have no value whatsoever. 
Also I think r/Bitcoin is about Bitcoin and shitcoins discussion should be kept on r/CryptoCurrency or some other subreddit.

Upvote for quality links.

No, we **do not** need to know who Satoshi Nakamoto is.
The technology speaks for itself and a preacher is anything but necessary. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 11:12:50
Nice one! I have a few Zimbabwean dollars framed but didn't think of adding something bitcoin related. Makes sense though, inflation and it's cure.
@_date: 2017-02-23 23:00:16
Well, you're on in green now (:
@_date: 2017-03-23 12:09:21
isn't it reversed in this case though?
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:17:49
BCH trading above 260USD on Kraken while around 200USD everywhere else. Does anyone know what caused this price mismatch? A large whale on the move?
@_date: 2017-01-21 09:19:35
Done. Good luck with the assignment!

Pretty smart to set up rules, then your mind doesn’t fuck with you as much and you can calculate the outcome of cases.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:01:14
Why would you need $50 to board btc? The fee isn’t that high 
@_date: 2019-04-05 13:25:04
It's a unix command [ based on [
@_date: 2019-04-28 09:21:35
You can't really just buy all mining capacity for a day though. Even trying Cornering the ASIC market would be difficult since the prices would increase with every large purchase. In reality the price tag would be way higher than $10M.

lol, I think at this point "blockchain" is sufficient to regard the whole settlement procedure. You may as well say that it's electricity or logic gates that makes it work ;)
@_date: 2019-04-28 15:15:26
Yeah, you are probably right in that regard. Which is very sad indeed. Maybe I'm lucky being surrounded by people where "blockchain" is sufficient.  
The Lightning Network as built on Bitcoin gets its security from the Bitcoin protocol involving settlement on the Bitcoin blockchain.
is maybe more exhaustive.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:48:39
Huh, never heard of it only 1 and 21. Is it a thing or did make it up now?
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:49:22
Welcome to the club mate (:
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:03:50
Yeah, I was there recently and when I actually saw the btc symbol I didn't realize it until a friend said "wow that's cheap" .  
@_date: 2019-09-01 08:36:11
But isn't the difficulty adjustment and decentralized trust just the reasons why it's "hard money"?
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:16:57
Yes, but slightly less. Small victories are still victories, no?
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:10:48
@_date: 2019-05-04 09:31:45
Patience, my friend...
@_date: 2019-05-14 23:12:21
Well, it's trusless in the sense that you do not need to trust anyone but yourself. Although in practices it may require a lot of hours(maybe even a degree in CS) to understand how consensus operates and what is required of you to know what software you're running. 
Compared to everything else, I for sure would call it trustless.
@_date: 2019-05-25 21:31:44
It is almost as if there is a free market ;)
