Section 300. It's dead center of the end zone. Lets hope for a lot of points/field goals!
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:05:27
HELL YEA THATS only like a couple sections away. Cheers!
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:12:03
Lmao. Damn, I hope that wasnt the downvote. You guys got the talent. Just need the staff now.
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:13:23
Good looking out dude! I was kinda thinking about that
@_date: 2015-08-04 06:17:28
Haha awesome man. I just got excited today because I realized you once you receive a payment, you can invest that into another loan. It was just something I didn't even think about. I'm going to look into autoinvest. These loan investing websites are so cool

[Here's a quick animation I threw together. I'll do a voice over when I wake up since it's 2:20 am here](
@_date: 2015-08-04 05:38:39
Awesome, thanks for clearing that all up
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:31:49
Just Galaxy devices? I have a HTC One M9, will that work 
@_date: 2015-08-04 05:26:46
Thank you. So the Investment Receivable is the amount I have invested and interest correct? And then the Coindesk USD would be added to that? Assuming no defaults
EDIT: Excuse me, is the Receivable section including the Coindesk USD that is invested?
@_date: 2015-07-26 00:20:33
Thanks, yes that was what I was meaning. I new Paypal and depositing money into a bank account were out of the question as those are reversible, was just wondering if there were any creative ways someone has come up with.
@_date: 2015-08-04 04:49:15
I have a good understanding on how it all works. I'm just trying to keep track of all my totals like amount invested, amount received and what not. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 22:14:10
I want to say I agree with that. I was supposed to sell yesterday in person (no show) and I am pretty certain it was an escort from Backpage because of her username and she stated she was new to this. Anyways, it dawned on me that I would probably have to explain to her that she probably won't be getting the full $20 and by the time she gets home, that $20 could be either more or less than what I initially sold her. 
I'm thinking of making a little Bitcoin "cheat sheet" to offer to new people when meeting up to sell. This was also (supposed to be) my first time selling locally.

This is like Qdoba having a tip jar at their register.

My idea is to use a QR as a watermark and be able to buy/license it right there from wherever you post the photo
@_date: 2015-07-21 04:55:23
I'm going to be in China by then. Anyone want any authentic Chinese goods? 
@_date: 2015-07-21 04:13:31
I literally had this idea today. Looks like I'll use this platform to sell my work
@_date: 2015-07-13 05:08:49
Thanks, I looked into it and is not accessible from China without a VPN apparently. But it looks promising
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:31:27
Wow this actually looks exactly like what I was envisioning. Thanks
@_date: 2015-07-21 19:07:08
I got you
@_date: 2015-07-24 22:08:30
That's not how that works
@_date: 2015-07-26 00:36:04
You're correct! I had one time out after 48 hours. Now what's to stop someone from just letting it time out instead of stop trade? Maybe they should build in a button on each end saying "buyer/seller not responding" and the other person has a limited amount of time to press a button to keep it from timing out and going against reputation
@_date: 2015-08-11 05:17:51
Hey just saw this. Yea, I'm pretty new to all this so I am learning on little money right now. I guess you can't say I have s strategy yet per se. I've invested little amounts into multiple loans... Basically checking out their scores and trying to get a good impression on the person and their intentions with the loans
@_date: 2015-07-13 22:59:06
August 11th?
@_date: 2015-07-21 00:06:57
Why is that? 
@_date: 2015-07-20 22:21:55
Check out Fiverr. I find it hard to believe you have absolutely nothing to offer. Sure, you may only be making $5 at a time to start but once you complete a couple orders, you can add on extras and make decent money. That's what I do. 
Edit: They pay out with Paypal (but accept Bitcoin as payment if you're a buyer) at least they acknowledge Bitcoin and hopefully can pay out in BTC in the future as well. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 04:34:37
I'm looking into it. I could see why this would work there. My question is, what's the benefits of buying localbitcoins rather than through Circle or Coinbase? 
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:17:03
This question is for the  CEO. Contact him at CEO
@_date: 2015-07-21 02:01:43
Thanks for the resources. I should be able to do it
@_date: 2015-07-28 15:03:08
Thank you sir 
@_date: 2015-07-21 02:01:11
Yes, I'm familiar. It's not so much about the watermark as I don't even use them on my photos but just easy access to be able to buy them (or donate) if people want to
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:50:13
As someone still very new to Bitcoin, this article was extremely useful. Thank you. Are there more articles similar to this where they use real world examples (Alice and Bob example) 
@_date: 2015-07-15 05:03:47
So I have to have Prime? Or the person who is buying my bitcoin can have Prime? A little confused
@_date: 2015-08-11 05:49:22
Would live action work? 
@_date: 2015-07-26 00:37:05
This seems like a good idea, and let them know you'll accept trade once you meet. Thanks for sharing
@_date: 2015-07-24 21:52:46
Still not worth the risk
@_date: 2015-07-25 23:56:20
I mean as in selling btc on there 
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:11:56
Yea thanks, buddy. I was hoping for something similar to Mint
@_date: 2015-07-13 08:13:10
Good answer. Just bought my first BTC with Paypal debit using Circle today
@_date: 2015-07-19 14:26:49
That's why you do your research. If you're shopping on a site you haven't heard of before, probably a good idea to Google it. Or just stay on reputable sites 
@_date: 2015-07-19 11:11:04
As someone who sells services in Fiverr regularly, I agree with you
