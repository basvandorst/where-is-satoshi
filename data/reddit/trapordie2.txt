Post recipes on your website?

why are you making declarative statements when you don't understand?
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:41:38
does that second part matter? I haven't researched what you are talking about very much, but at face value it seems like it is more for ease of use, like a DNS request. When sending a payment, instead of specifying their BTC address you would put in something like amazon.com, and it would look up amazon's BTC address. Is that not what this is about?

Facts are facts bud.

Not stupid at all. The way I understand it yes if you own coins from before a fork then you own one of each. Although how to sell them separately, etc. is something I haven't had to look in to yet and don't understand.

sure bud, whatever you say.
You sound like Sean Spicer explaining, covfefe.
"The president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant,"
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:50:16
"The golden age, started with Trumps ascension.." okay.

You couldn't pay me to listen to Scott Adams for more than the 60 seconds I just tried.

It really doesn't make sense at all. He realized he sounded dumb, and he is back-pedaling. That's all there is to it.
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:11:56
Uh ya, that's his supposed explanation after the fact...
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:42:05
“It’s like we’re mentally in prison. I like the word ‘prison’ because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks.”
What does this even mean? He's not saying anything. He is just stringing words together.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:07:27
Haha ok.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:07:18
Haha ok.

Give it time bud. It's what 8 years old? The point in the future is to build layers on top of bitcoin to help make these things possible.

@_date: 2017-11-26 17:07:41
Haha ok.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:07:11
Haha ok.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:07:03
Haha ok.

How do you think panspermia can exist without evolution?
Do you think lions and elephants would just coming raining in from space?
@_date: 2019-04-30 23:46:37
I'm reading the wikipedia page for pansermia.
"Crick noted later that life may have originated on Earth."
"Payloads may contain extremophiles for diverse environments and cyanobacteria similar to early microorganisms. Hardy multicellular organisms (rotifer cysts) may be included to induce higher evolution."
Everything I can find about panspermia seems to indicate the evolution would still be 100% necessary.
Again if I am wrong, please explain how we get a human on earth?

This was the part I couldn't wrap my head around.
