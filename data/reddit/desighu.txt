This bot is really cool. You can see this an application layer. You can play lottery on your own group, raise fund, tip, send in and out to other lightning nodes, many cool functions and no need to download anything. It’s good way to introduce people to lightning. This is a huge step.
Check it out
On telegram.

Exchanges will be more happy. They don’t have to waste their time tracking coins. They are tracking now because they are afraid the governments would comeback at them later in times.

Rsk has founders tax on every block. It’s a scam.
Anyways, the idea of smart contract is a hype, like blockchain and Turin completeness.

Just configured my LND node.. amazing. It’s fast as hell.. amazing.
One thing I don’t like is my IP address together with my node id. I don’t like this idea.

I just checked his twitter, he supports trump and hates the left. Supporting either side of the government is equally bad. 
He is indeed a statist and cannot be satoshi.

I am using it on main net

Would be nice if there were no IP address at all. I wanted to announce my id but I did not do it just because of the ip. 
Now everyone can see how much money you have in your channels. They can analyse and link your cold storage and locate you, even if you have not given your id to any of the exchanges. 
At least bitcoin is pseudonymous. Lightening is a terrible idea. Linking your ip and your money is the worst thing you could come up with. 
This is not cypherpunk.. this is exactly the opposite..

I am a bit sad.. waited so long for lightening and Had high hopes but when I saw IP address I was very disappointed. 
How would you run a node on ipfs?
