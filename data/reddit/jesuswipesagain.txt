A majority of the shops only accept cash and have atms inside so I doubt anyone will use bitcoin. It's simply slower and more complicated than cash, for the time being. Nice to have some guidance in place for the future and free publicity for btc is nice as well, but Washington State is not likely to have a significant volume of weed purchased with bitcoins. Cash is just too​ easy. 
I'm sure the shops would love if more people used btc. Lots of break ins due to piles of cash and drugs in the back of the stores. My local shop has been broken into several times this year.

A currency in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins. (Copied from Wikipedia) 
You are wrong. BTC is a medium of exchange, therefore currency.

If you had a large amount of hashpower would you sell it at a loss? Why pay BTC to get BTC slowly "paid" to you? 
Cloud mining is a scam. Full stop.

Zzzzz, I doubt anyone here cares. Some original FUD would be nice for a change.

Don't use a web wallet. Use mycelium/breadwallet on your phone.

They deliver Amazon boxes and advertising instead of letters now.

Weed in my state is waaaay cheaper now. This is most apparent with larger amounts. An ounce of high quality would cost $300+ on the street, pre-legalization. Same ounce is now 150-200 in legal stores and that includes a massive tax. Prices at the per gram level have been lees affected. $25 eighths and $50 quarters are fairly common, though its usually what would be considered "mid grade". Legalized weed has increased supplies and decreased prices, as expected.

Amazon does an increasing amount of last mile on their own through the Flex program.

There is a "anti-ad block blocker" (fuck thats a stupid name, lol) filter in uBlock. It is turned off by default. I don't remember the steps but Google does.

Anyone who puts 100k into cloud mining is 100% lying or 100% stupid. 
Cloud mining is a scam. End of story. If you want BTC....buy BTC. It's really that simple.

I have had simple for a year and buy weekly from coinbase. All is good so far. Hope BBVA compass is similarly chill.

How people can handle this much white space (and the light it creates) on the screen boggles my mind. Big shout out to the Blockfolio devs for introducing night mode in a recent update.
....as for the obligatory "fuck yeah, over 9000 soon, lets see dat moon! HODL!"... Well...there you go :-D

I am buying more buuut.... I can't speak for everyone and I have been buying more since 2014. Generally speaking, no, it is not a good idea to buy into a peak, especially ATH.
