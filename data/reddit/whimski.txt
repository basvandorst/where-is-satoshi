That still doesn't change the cost of entry, I'm just saying that the barrier is pretty low. There's basically two costs for a mining operation: Initial acquisition cost for mining hardware and electricity. You can find residential electricity in the US for $0.03 per kw/h. Even Antminer S3s can still be profitable at that cost.
If you're trying to make actual money, ASICs are generally more cost effective. If you want to hobby around with a single GPU, you can make a few bucks a day, but you aren't really contributing to the blockchain in a meaningful way. No matter the algorithm, economies of scale will take over. For every 1 person that has a single GPU setup, there will be somebody else running 100 GPUs in their garage. For every person with 100 GPUs in their garage, there's a farm with 10,000 GPUs. It's just as centralized, the hardware is only a little different. There's only 2 producers of GPUs suitable for mining in the world, just as there's at least 2 ASIC manufacturers as well.
The main problem with ASICs is that the biggest manufacturer (Bitmain) also uses them to mine, and that's what's causing an over-centralization. NVIDIA or AMD could potentially decide to do the same thing at any moment and the problem becomes the same, although that is not likely. China is currently trying to shut down some mining operations (allegedly) and GMO is coming out with their own ASICs soon, so we very well might be seeing a bit of a shift away from China in the near future.
As an aside, if you're a gamer or PC hardware enthusiast, you really don't want to see Bitcoin move to a GPU friendly algorithm. You won't be able to buy a graphics card. They will be 2-3x the prices they're at now, which are already crazily inflated due to mining. $400 MSRP Vegas are going for $900+ on eBay, 1080ti's are out of stock everywhere. It's a mess.

This is why I've always advocated that High Schools have a "Life Skills" sort of class that teaches them how to budget, how credit cards work, how to pay your taxes, how to get a job... among other social/life happenings directly out of high school. I believe that education could help a lot (with fiscal responsibility especially).
But nope, calculus and learning about Egyptian society for the 3rd time is more important.

I just laugh at those people. If somebody is actually educated and wants to debate about the current market conditions or the actual technical factors at play that are potentially harmful for crypto, I'm all for it. If it's just "durr I heard on CNN that it's a bubble and they can make infinite bitcoins!!11! You're going to lose all your money!" then I'll just laugh and try to make a bet on bitcoin with them. Nobody has taken my "I'll bet you 1 bitcoin now for 1 bitcoin in a year".
I think part of it comes from jealousy, they see you've made a bunch of "magical internet money" and they missed out because they didn't take your advice on it, so they want it (and you) to fail so they can feel better about their choices... but I digress.

Used equipment that has an ROI of 3 months and sells for 1.5x to 4x the original purchase price, sure. AFAIK they've also gotten much better at maintaining their equipment and all of the purchases I've made from them recently have been new or like-new machines.
Do you know why there's such a gap in mining facilities, in terms of total hashrate? It's because it's either a hobby on the side or EXTREMELY lucrative. A 3 month ROI with diminishing returns is still... a 3 month ROI.

Just to echo this point, staking a deflationary currency dramatically enhances it's deflationary nature, greatly leading to a "rich get richer scenario". Hyperdeflation is also a valid concern in that scenario, and I'm of the opinion that if Bitcoin went PoS it would lead to an extreme bubble that would consolidate and centralize coins into big money's pockets, which is extremely counter to Bitcoin's goals of decentralization and accessibility.

At this point, Bitcoin probably isn't "safe" for the average consumer, as they need more security and insurance than what it offers. For those of us who can handle (and enjoy) the responsibility though, it's great.
I don't doubt that there will be solutions in the future that are built on top of Bitcoin that can handle arbitration etc, kind of like how banks/visa/etc are similar-ish to a "2nd layer" of cash. If that's able to happen ala Lightning Network, I think widespread adoption is pretty possible. Being able to choose to hold Bitcoin personally (like cash, but better) or put it in an insured "Bitcoin Bank" would be up to the individual.

Where will you live while you're saving up this 100k? If saving up 100k is "easy", paying rent is not a very smart decision when you can instead be making house payments for a similar number. You're not really being logical here, and saving up 100k is very difficult for a lot of people, not to mention that 100k is not even close to enough money to buy a house anywhere near where I live. So.. $600,000? How does your argument change for that number? "Still not very hard to save up $600,000"? Get real

Would they really be able to cripple it more so than they can now, or significantly worse than the current situation? I'd say no.
I will say that I think block size is pretty irrelevant to the whole scaling debate anyway, at true scale even 100mb blocks could still have issues, and 100mb blocks would most definitely cause centralization. If Bitcoin is to be used as a true global currency it could see the same volume as VisaNet (probably more), meaning that 2nd layer solutions like LN are the answer.

Oh no, I agree with basically everything you've just said (especially about the Bitcoin market, lots of stupid money, Long Blockchain and Kodak are prime examples). The only thing I had issue with is that you said he's trying to close the wealth gap, because he is directly benefitting and making money off the exploitation of cheap labor. What's great for shareholders is generally not great for the workforce, especially the farther down you go (minimum wage). It's laughable how freaking cheap labor is, inflation has completely screwed the lower class. You see companies posting record profits and finding their market cap at all time highs, and minimum wage hasn't been raised since 2009. It's $7.25. How laughable is that? That's another topic for another time though..

Anyone actually worried about decentralization or any sort of attack aren't mining on BTC.com or Antpool anyway though. I doubt people would switch because 1: they don't care enough about maximizing profits (Antpool doesn't pay transaction fees) and 2: They don't really care/know enough about Bitcoin and the decentralization issue.
A lot of miners are really, really stupid.

BTC and ETH are probably 2 of the 5-6 coins total that are actually worth something significant.

Tell me, why would you want or need a trustless system of money when it's being controlled by a central entity? It negates the entire point of cryptocurrency. If you have control over a currency, you can verify it on your own terms. There's no need for trustless p2p interactions because it's going though a central authority.

"Actively worked to reduce the income gap" Please don't buy the hype of the .1%. Successful consumer-faced businesses quite literally profit off of low wages. Look at Jeff Bezos.
He's a charitable person, and I admire him for that and other reasons, but charity has almost nothing to do with the growing wealth gap. It's systemic.

If you ever find yourself on bitcointalk, there's a good amount of misc Bitcoin related hardware like mining equipment and the like... they ALL use escrow in some way or another. It's fairly common practice in my experience, and I don't doubt that crypto-specific escrow services are going to pop up in the future (there's already some small ones)
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:46:06
I don't think PoS can work with a deflationary or otherwise fixed supply. Eventually you either run out of tokens, or you're getting paid off of verifying transactions (transaction fees in that scenario would be tremendous by the way)

This is one of the things I appreciate most about Bitcoin. Lack of arbitration on a fundamental level, like cash (and it can't be faked like cash). Arbitration isn't tied to a currency anyway, it's tied to law and the institutions holding that currency. When you become the "institution" by holding your private wallet, you are the one responsible for your own arbitration, and you can most definitely contest purchases made with Bitcoin.
Also, businesses already have a large incentive to "make good" on a purchase made. And if you're talking about 3rd party sellers, there's many escrow services that can ensure that both parties are satisfied. This is what it means to take arbitration into your own hands.

To counter your argument, "buying a few nice things to make life less shitty because you're poor" is how credit cards fuck your life over even more. If you are barely making ends meet, DO NOT get a credit card. It will not help you, it will enable you debt and you will be crushed by interest. Deciding to splurge $15 for a meal once a week doesn't seem that bad, but if you carry that interest for years, as many people do, that $15 meal costs you many more times that. Would you eat that decent meal if you knew it was actually going to cost you $40? If you're forced to live off of cash-on-hand you will never overspend your means. You might go hungry sometimes, but you'll be able to make conscious decisions about the value of particular items.
Because that's what credit cards do, they take away your ability to make informed and disciplined decisions about your finances. "$15 isn't too much, I can afford that, I can treat myself, it's been a really hard week" is exactly the trap they want you to fall in. It puts you into a spending mentality instead of a survival/saving mentality. People who get into credit card debt never get out unless they completely shift their mindset because they fall into this trap. I could pay off a friends $15k credit card debt right now and I guarantee you he'd be back to maxing his cards off in a couple years.

What do you mean by "profit margin" being 50%? I don't think you understand how the business of mining works, and I can assure you that on a year-over-year basis, they are up SIGNIFICANTLY more than 50%. Try 5000% and you might be close.
1% is actually nothing. No reason to stake for 1%. I might as well be in fiat for that. You can offer me a 1% return to hold onto my coins for a single day and I would say no.

There are at least 4 grammatical errors and the quality of the "news banner" on the image is pretty MS Paint looking. It's also extremely clickbait-y for a Sponsored post. I don't have to know anything about Bitcoin or whatever industry this ad is for, I can tell it's not worth my click. (A good portion of this applies to native English speakers, at least)
Knowledge is tied with intelligence. If you've been on the internet for a while, it's pretty clear what's a scam and what isn't. If you haven't learned from 1000+ hours of browsing Facebook, you're probably not very smart, and could be duped by something like this. The real proof of a lack of critical thinking would be their decision making after clicking the banner and deciding to go through with investing in whatever the website says, because if their sponsored ad is this cheap, I'd bet their website is even worse.

You can generally afford to buy an ASIC if you can buy a GPU setup, just saying. There's this common misconception that ASIC equipment is prohibitively expensive, but $1500-$2500 isn't much more than a new gaming PC, and aligns very closely to the price of (cheaper) GPU mining rigs.
Edit: I'll put it to you this way. Bitmain's January batch of S9s were priced under $1500. They currently gross about $900 a month worth of Bitcoin.

I'm saying the STAKE reward isn't worth it. There's no economic incentive to stake if it's 1%. The higher you make the incentive, the greater the deflationary effect. It's a cause and effect. If you don't see how that ends I don't think you understand hyperdeflation at all.

While I don't agree with his language, I will extrapolate on the point that one of Bitcoin's greatest strength (in my eyes) is taking financial power away from institutions like banks and government and putting it into your own hands. Part of this power transfer does result in a lack of arbitration, or a need for you to put more personal responsibility over your keys as well as each and every transaction.

As far as energy-to-USD is concerned, BTC mining is almost never in the  spot. Space is fairly irrelevant too due to the insane power density that any sort of mining equipment has. The main comparison comes in the upfront cost (and thus ROI) and what coins/algorithms you want to speculate on. BTC ASICs have historically been the most stable investments you can make in this industry, as new technology doesn't invalidate old equipment immediately, and you don't have to worry about coins forking and making your equipment obsolete.

The only letters that serve a purpose are because the government and/or certain companies haven't adopted digital delivery of notices, bills, checks (money), etc. They could easily (and should) deliver virtually all mail in a digital format.
Physical mail is an archaic concept. I really don't see how you're on a Bitcoin subreddit arguing that physical mail serves any real purpose which an electronic format couldn't/doesn't do better. The only purpose it serves now is essentially a (pretty shitty) identity/delivery system, but blockchain is a great application for decentralizing and verifying identity systems.

Actually, it's not the SHA-256 algorithm which is the most secure, it's the actual Bitcoin network itself. For example, if any of the top 5 Bitcoin mining pools decided to, they could 51% attack basically any other SHA-256 coin. Litecoin Cash for example is EXTREMELY open to a 51% attack because it has a teeny tiny fraction of the overall SHA-256 hashrate. When it comes to defending against 51% attacks nothing comes even close to Bitcoin besides maybe Ethereum.
@_date: 2018-05-05 08:01:31

You can also get cheap power without paying a bulk rate. If you're paying $0.11 per kWh for a medium size operation like OP is suggesting people are, you're only doing so out of gross incompetence or laziness. That's not a "mining farm", that's a "dumpster fire".

It's because it doesn't make sense the way he's saying it, at all. As somebody who is in this game, he's effectively talking about selling mining equipment speculatively. I did this in the January bear market and nearly 5x'd on my miners, but had the price of BTC gone to 25k+ and stayed there, I'd have lost a significant portion of my Hashrate for nothing. It's similar in nature to selling vs holding your mining rewards, except your investments are hedged for the entire algorithm rather than a specific coin.
Basically, I think he got lucky with the timing with his "3 month" strategy, but if he continues in that way without actually considering the market conditions and hardware improvements/introductions, he's going to get burned. If you follow his advice starting in February for example, you lose 60%+ of your initial investment.
@_date: 2018-05-29 00:02:48
I think what he's saying is that the mining industry is growing, and many operations are only capped by how much energy they can effectively push towards mining, rather than how many machines there are. If a Bitcoin ASIC came out that was 5x more energy effective than what's currently out there, the mining network would eventually have 5x the hashrate and eat up a similar amount of power, if not more.
You can see this effect worldwide with the introduction of LED lights. They are extremely cost effective to keep running, but instead of pushing energy consumption down, they have mostly increased the amount lighting that's powered on.
@_date: 2018-05-28 23:57:59
For some reason he pegs the size of a mining operation to it's electricity costs, which makes no sense. There are many, many, small-to-medium players that are paying under $0.05 per kWh. I'd argue here are more near that price than there are at $0.11 like he's suggesting, for obvious reasons (economies of scale)

While most of your information is correct, it's hard to take you seriously because "A Bitcoin price of $0 is BREAK-EVEN for me" makes you full of shit. If you've already ROI'd, great, but that's a much different statement than BTC $0 being breakeven. It's just factually untrue.
And your advice to sell miners after 3 months, like wut? Sure, I personally 5x'd in the January bear market from reselling my $1400 S9s for $5000, but that's entirely different from running a mining operation, that's just speculative resale. Take your $2500 S9s from February and you can barely get $800 for them now. This is not blanket good advice, and you pawning it off as such is just irresponsible and shows that you're just some guy who got lucky with timing rather than someone making calculated risk assessment.

Provable scarcity virtually guarantees monetary value. Your nephew's finger paintings can be replicated indefinitely and have no identifiable traits that are unique only to those finger paintings. I've seen many people use a similar analogy but it just doesn't work in this context.

I've heard the snowflake argument a bunch. Snowflakes are unique, but not scarce. An estimated million billion snowflakes fall each year in the world. It's funny because snowflakes actually have pretty substantial value when/where they are scarce (ie. ski resorts etc using snow making machines to help with bad weather conditions).
As for the boulder, again, it's unique but not scarce. I can go chop up a bunch of boulders at any time and add to the "supply".
Yes, in order for anything to have value it must have some sort of function attached to it, but that function can be something as simple as "feeling good" or "looking pretty". Look at fine art, for example.
Bitcoin's utility as money is the least important aspect of it's value. There are hundreds of cryptocurrencies out there that are just as good if not better than Bitcoin at being money. The true value of Bitcoin is derived from the *provable scarcity* of it, look at BCH for example. BCH is pretty much strictly better than BTC is at being money at the moment, but it is worth a whole lot less. Why is that? Because the network it runs on is trusted less than BTCs network. The true fungibility of BCH long-term is in question, as it is more open to attacks due to it's more centralized network.

It's pretty hard to argue that those things have inherent value and also argue that bitcoin doesn't have inherent value. If I am able to trade my Bitcoin for any of those things, they either all have inherent value or none of them do.
Also this is getting into semantics but think about a bottle of water. Does it have inherent value? Water is one of the most important substances on earth, but its' value changes drastically. Imagine how the residents of Flint, MI perceive the value of a bottle of water vs somebody who lives in Seattle. Does a pre-manufactured bottle of water (like Dasani) have more value than a home-bottled bottle of water through a filtered tap? No. It doesn't. So why is it so much more expensive and still such a successful product? Because inherent value is meaningless, market value is the only thing that matters in a trade-based economy (which is pretty much all economies)

But think in terms on the macro scale. Nobody has 100% of their net worth invested. Over time, that running average of $3000 or whatever in your checking account is losing you value because generally fiat and traditional investments are mutually exclusive.
If crypto gets widely adopted as a form of payment, I can hold close to 100% of my free 'cash' in crypto. That running average of around $3000 now grows and grows... without me losing access to it. Hell, if I didn't have to keep a buffer of USD in my checking account over the past year, I'd be significantly wealthier right now.

People were also saying that Bitcoin was dead at the time, so that argument is pretty moot. I do agree that TA (I am aware that this isn't TA) or using charts like this isn't a very effective method of decision making on it's own, but it can help gauge market sentiment which will inform you to make better decisions when you take into account other contributing factors.

As a deflationary currency it would generally maintain value over fiat if it had widespread adoption.
The $3000 in my checking account that I use as a buffer would only lose a little value over a year, but think about all the money in all checking accounts combined that is basically sitting there losing value. Banks make money on it, but you sure as hell don't. Holding and spending crypto takes profits from banks and gives it to the individual. Sure, crypto may not keep growing in value, but if it gets widely adopted (master card / visa status) it will be hard-pressed to lose value vs fiat.

He's saying that the market conditions now are substantially different than the ones back then. Exchanges are literally barring entry because the growth has been so crazy they can't keep up. Exchanges make money from volume, so turning away paying customers is a very big deal.

And I'm arguing that centralized products like VisaNet will always be able to outpace the transactional throughput of Bitcoin because of the inherent qualities of a decentralized blockchain.
That article makes some pretty significant leaps in logic and deduction. Block sizes cannot be raised to 100mb and still run on standard full nodes, period. These would all be pruned nodes that don't carry the entire blockchain, there is a HUGE problem with this. A decentralized system that relies on "archival nodes" to download the blockchain history is orders of magnitude easier to attack than when every node is a full node. 100mb blocks would require a full node to be running on it's own dedicated 1gigabit up/down, and the "average person" does not have access to those speeds, at all. Hell, the average person can't generally commit the 33mbps needed 24/7 to run the kind of node they're talking about. When I was living in Chicago my internet speed was quoted at 50mbps but I got between 30-50 depending on local traffic. My node will likely fail at those peak times, and could potentially be knocked offline trying to sync up for a pretty significant period of time. Not to mention that the internet usage at my apartment would be effectively neutered altogether. And that's on 50mbps, the highest speed available to me. A lot of people have it was worse than that. This obviously means that these pruned nodes would be rarer, and full nodes would be significantly rarer. Less nodes = less security. Less full nodes = even lesser security. Transactional throughput is not the entire point of Bitcoin. Security and decentralization is.

Sure, crypto may not keep growing in value, but if it gets widely adopted (master card / visa status) it will be hard-pressed to lose value vs fiat.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but this is pretty much how the current BTC mining industry works. Buy BTC -&gt; Buy ASICs with BTC -&gt; Mine BTC -&gt; Buy ASICs with BTC -&gt; etc

No, sorry. Blockchain technology just can't handle the transactional throughput that a GLOBAL cash-like currency system needs. Blockchain is inefficient by design, especially when compared to centralized payment networks like VisaNet. Saying otherwise is just ignorant of the fundamental technology behind blockchain. Carrying over a complete ledger for every transaction is inefficient by design, and will NEVER be able to compete with transactional throughput of centralized networks if utilizing main chain transactions only.

The problem inherent to running nodes that only have a partial ledger in them is that the full ledger has to exist somewhere. Significantly higher blocksizes would limit the "average user" to using only these sort of nodes, meaning that the full blockchain ledger is run on less and less nodes, making attacks much easier. You won't need hashpower to rewrite transactions if you can get network (full node) consensus instead.
Another way of stating it is that if a majority of nodes are keeping only the last 100 blocks, every block after 100 essentially loses the security of a majority of the network, and is now only backed by the full nodes. This means that the 100 confirmations is essentially moot: the block is now out of most nodes and is no longer confirmed by a majority of the network, only the full nodes. This would result in a large amount of node centralization around those who can afford running a full ledger. At it's core, a node running in this manner is practically useless for defending against anything but short-term mining attacks, at which point you can probably cut down the node to 6 blocks anyways.


That's probably true. I don't know enough about BIP152 to refute block compressions effect on block propagation and node security, but I will say that the compression of block headers is only part of that protocol so the 2% number seems a little misleading.

It is definitely relevant, if you look at the current use cases of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the fastest, easiest, and cheapest way to send a large amount of money. I just sold and bought a house and in the transaction there were at least 6 different wire transfers, banks typically charge ~$30 for those types of transfers, and while it's not a significant percentage of the amount sent, it still adds up. Had I been able to use Bitcoin I'd have paid under a dollar. I also had to wait 3 days being homeless because the transfers all took the maximum of the "1 business day" timeframe.
Another example, I once bought a car, had all the money in my checking account, literally walked in and offered asking, should have been the easiest transaction ever. Nope. 1-The banks were closed and I couldn't get a cashier's check/money order and 2-They maxed out debit card transactions at $5000 and wouldn't do multiple transactions. Their "solution" was to run my credit and take a personal check from me, not going to happen, my credit isn't great. I legitimately couldn't buy a car that day and had to come back the next day during banking business hours (it was a 2 hr drive). I went, got a cashier's check, of which I had issues even getting in the first place because the branch manager didn't think my signature lined up with the one they had on file, went to pay the dealership, they had to go on the phone and call the bank to ensure that the check was legitimate. That took about 30 minutes on it's own.
The banking system is broken. It doesn't run 24/7 and it doesn't have a sufficient identity system in place, just your social security number. It's starting to provide digital solutions but the speed at which the banking system moves is like a snail compared to Bitcoin. ACH is like 2-5 days and that's pretty much the best they got. Screw that. Bitcoin offers an immutable identity system and extremely fast transactions for insanely cheap. Yeah, it's not going to work for $1 transactions in the future.. but why do you need that? Why do you need an immutable ledger and digital identity system for a candy bar?

I'm for bigger blocks as a short-term scaling solution, but there is something significant to be said about the centralization and security implications of those bigger blocks. Thinking that 100mb blocks are good for a decentralized system is just idiotic. Even the best case scenario that they lay out in that article is absolutely catastrophic for the security of Bitcoin.

And gave no evidence or even a guess of a number (probably because you don't know).
I have 50 apples, some of them are rotten. It's dramatically different if that 'some' is 5 or 45.

What I mean is that if I'd have been able to buy $3000 worth of BTC or other crypto instead of constantly keeping it in a checking account for general spending/emergencies, I'd be significantly wealthier.
It's also not just my checking account I'm talking about. It's all checking accounts combined. Banks get returns off of it, but you sure as hell don't. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:43:19
That logic doesn't hold up. It's many multitudes more difficult to prove something IS NOT than to prove something IS (if even possible in the first place). For example:
"I have 38 toes"
I cannot give any evidence that I have 38 toes, but you can't prove that I don't have 38 toes. Does this mean that it's up to opinion until you can prove that I don't have 38 toes? No. The fact that I have 38 toes is for me to prove, not for you to disprove, as it is an unreasonable claim.

Because your reasoning doesn't really hold up. We have a clear example of how this works with BCH, and since B2X doesn't have EDA or any other significant incentive to mine it really has zero chance of competing. Miners can mine it all they want, but they will just get swallowed up by the miners pointing hashrate towards the more profitable chain.
Ex. For $3000 of costs would you rather have a coin worth $6000 or $1000? There is no logical argument for the $1000 coin, as you can mine the $6000 coin and then convert it to 6 $1000 coins.
It's not like BTG either, there is no pre-mine. The economic incentive is just not there.

Bitcoin banking. Every second layer solution which exists for cash can (and probably will) exist for BTC. Coinbase is already extremely similar to an online banking app.
@_date: 2018-07-04 09:05:46
Yeah, you're never getting consensus for something insane like freezing funds or changing keys for what is essentially a theft.
@_date: 2018-07-06 07:03:31
Honestly, I have no clue wtf you're talking about and how it relates to gaining consensus about hardforking funds or keys. Bitcoin's value is in it's immutability. Forking funds even once completely destroys that. It has nothing to do with the nature of money, it's the nature of ownership.

Those aren't scarce, nor are they "unique" in any pragmatic sense. Your pinky finger or pubic hair is not any different than the billions of others on the planet.
I'm open to examples of actually scarce things that don't have value though, I'd be interested in learning about one.
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:18:05
You mentioned that your pubes and pinky finger were "one of a kind", ie unique. I argued that those things aren't scarce, and also shut down your extraneous argument that those things are unique in any useful way. On the other hand, Bitcoin keys are unique, so I'm not sure where you're going with that one...
It's pretty laughable at how you challenge my reading comprehension when it's clear you understand little about what specific points we're arguing over in the first place. And jesting about snowflakes? I hope you realize that snow has substantial value where it is scarce, and not a lot of value where it isn't. Ironically, it's actually a great example about why you're wrong.
Again, I'd encourage you to give me an example of something that is SCARCE and worth little or nothing. Until then, you don't have any ground to stand on.
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:00:33
You seem to be conflating scarce and unique. If you're going to argue semantics at least have a grasp of the words you're arguing over. I'm out of this conversation. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-07-04 21:42:32
Not sure what the joke is, but I would pull all of my money out of Bitcoin forever if we ever reached consensus on freezing funds or changing keys.

How to trade Bitcoin, volume 1:
1. Invest in Bitcoin
2. Bitcoin goes up, trade it for ETH/alts
3. ETH or alt/BTC pair rises in value, trade back for BTC
4. Profit
It's been a pretty consistent pattern. In downtrends BTC has been acting as a somewhat safe haven, when the market is bullish the money in BTC tends to spread out into alts. People on this sub seem to love the phrase "don't try to time the market" but god damn almost every run in the past 6 months has been the same.

This doesn't really increase adoption though... Why use an ATM when I can buy/sell from my phone? Half the point of a digital currency is the convenience factor. ATMs are a half-assed solution to add convenience to the traditional banking system, I really don't see the point of bringing that sort of "solution" to crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-27 06:08:33
Actually, if something is provably scarce that in itself can drive immense value.

LOL lauding Ver as BCH's Andreas is hilarious. Andreas is one of the most well-articulated proponents of Bitcoin, who talks about the merits and impact of Bitcoin's technology. Ver is a baby who flips people off in interviews for using the phrase "BCash" and talks more about "vision" than anything else.
