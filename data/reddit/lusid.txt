So sick of trolls.
Satoshi announced the existence of the bitcoin network and the availability of his software on the day he started it, on a cryptography mailing list. The first block in the blockchain is dated from January 3rd, 2009. In order to determine its hash, the first block uses a newspaper title from that same day, which proves that the date was not faked and coins were not premined.
Just because you were too stupid to see value in something that hadn't yet taken off doesn't mean the people that helped get it there shouldn't be rewarded for the time and effort they put into getting it there. Bitcoin is a crowdsourced experiment with no central authority, and that is exactly why a bank might make use of it (to reduce their own costs) but would never put up the money or time to duplicate it. 
Nothing will ever exist in the commercial world that has the same promises that Bitcoin provides.

Not necessarily deleted (I'm too lazy too go look at the moment). Gource, the program used to create this, has settings for collapsing branches of the codebase that aren't worked on for some time.

Agreed. A graph database backend with a GUI is really the right way to approach blockchain analysis. Exposing a query language on top of it like Gremlin would really sweeten the deal. Been working on something similar for quite awhile when time permits.

And the reason he is shown here first is because he helped migrate the code over from Sourceforge. This video doesn't include the history prior to August 29, 2009.

I like it because it serves two purposes...
On one hand, everyone except you in the Bitcoin community seems to love it just for the sheer fact that they hit the nail on the head... these are the things that we all say. The people that don't say these things are the ones that bailed at $480 when Gox dropped, which I picked up shortly before it shot to $670.
On the other, anyone who is watching it to laugh at their friends who talk about Bitcoin all the time are actually hearing the information repeated again... they might even hear something that they've not heard before. Luckily for us, everything he is saying is based on fact or at least partial fact (or the first group of people wouldn't like it so much).
The video you posted, on the other hand, is just making fun of Bitcoin for the same things the rest of media make fun of it for (which is largely based on what laymen can see and understand). Yes, yes, very original.

We don't know Satoshi's reasoning for doing any of the things he did. I can tell you for certain that he mined from the genesis block from the same time that everyone else was given access to do the same, and that was the main bit of FUD I was replying to. If you want to see premined coins, take a look at some of your favorite alts.
While I can't speak for Satoshi, I can speak for myself as a developer if I were in his shoes. If he had the same ideals that I currently possess about the world, then I would've been mining the coins not for the reason people mine today (wealth) but just for the act of mining until more developers came along to help or until I decided the project was dead in the water (since at least one person mining is what keeps the network online).

Sure, if someone hasn't done it already by tomorrow, I'll see what I can do. I tried earlier actually before I posted the name of it here, but I was having problems getting it to compile on my Mac. Will try again in Windows or Linux as soon as I get an opportunity.

I'm arrogant? Maybe. But not ignorant. I actually understand the thing I'm talking about, unlike yourself, which makes my arrogance a gift in situations like this one...
It isn't the same thing at all. The GENESIS BLOCK (the first block of the blockchain that we build our Bitcoin transactions from) is encoded with a message that can never be changed with the DATE and the HEADLINE of a newspaper that is verifiable. Every transaction that follows builds cryptographically on this first block. This date MATCHES the date his message was posted for the first time, and at that time, anyone could mine. However, it would be impossible to mine blocks prior to this date.
Edit: I'm a bit off on my dates, but that doesn't change the fact he started mining on Jan 3rd and released the code on Jan 9. He was able to premine 14 blocks worth, a total of 700 bitcoins... WOW. And just to show that intelligent people were able to pick it up and run with it from that day, [Hal Finney]( a well known developer from original PGP Corporation that created the first reusable proof of work system back in 2004, replied on Jan 11 and actually mined a block himself sometime in January!
[Satoshi's First Post to the Cryptography Mailing List on Jan 9, 2009](
[Hal Finney's Reply to Satoshi's First Post on Jan 11, 2009](
[The Genesis Block]( that contains the coinbase hex:
[Hex/Ascii Converter]( that you can use yourself to see the message
[The 14th Block of the Blockchain]( dated 1/9/2009
Now... with all that said, if all you are complaining about is the difficulty curve created by the algorithm that ensures the supply slowly increases with time, well, the opposite has already been done. It is called Ripple. And even after they handed them out like candy during their launch, I still barely hear about it to this day. Mainly because a currency controlled by a corporation that was premined in the millions is pretty much poison to anyone that understands the true benefits of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:10:41
My favorite part of what you are saying is that you are completely oblivious to the fact that Bitcoin is the first decentralized, trustless network to solve the Byzantine Generals problem in history. Some of us would say this is as great an invention as the internet, or TV, or the printing press. Meanwhile, people like you whine about the fact that it has created a revolution in money as a side effect, and you just happened to not be "in the secret club."
However, you still think that anyone, even Satoshi himself, had any clue that Bitcoin would ever actually be "a thing?" He even replied to a few people on the mailing list that were critics that it wouldn't hurt for them to download it and try it, just to have a few coins in case it ever does "become a thing." Projects like this are released all the time, and most of the time, nothing ever comes of them. He released it in the only place where anyone would actually care, and from there, it grew outwards to the masses. This is how great innovation happens. The whole point of this was to prove a solution to the Byzantine Generals problem that could be useful in many applications. Not to make you, or anyone else, rich.
Or you can just market your way to greatness with something that hasn't been tested, vetted, and improved by anyone. That is always an option. Until it blows up in your face.
So, yeah, good luck with that.

I ran a Minecraft server for several years (since alpha), and slowly moved to Tekkit then to Feed the Beast with GregTech enabled (to increase the difficulty of getting the more advanced items). Had a really great and loyal player base (age 18+ mostly). At some point, around mid 2013, I wrote a custom plugin to support the deposit/withdraw of Bitcoins and wired up the entire economy to be player to player, and I took less than a percent off the top from withdraws. After all of this work, it was a complete bust. People didn't mind using the conversion from item to mBTC to item again since mBTC was the primary currency on the server, but no one ever deposited or withdrew. It wasn't long after that that I just shut the server down completely and moved on.
TLDR; even after injecting a large amount of my own Bitcoins into running a Bitcoin economy on our server, no one used it... not even a single withdraw.

I commend you for trying, but these people have no understanding of the business world. They ~~play~~ live in a game 24 hours a day (I'm an avid gamer, and I stopped playing WoW at level 10 when I realized it thrives on subscription fees of rats that like to press levers).
They most likely don't understand that it costs money to accept money in the real world. They most likely don't understand or care that your original intent was to get Blizzard to accept Bitcoin, not to talk them all into using it (a side effect). They don't understand anything you were trying to say, as a matter of fact. And that is probably the fault of our uneducated/bought media.
In my opinion, Bitcoin is far enough along now that it is an unstoppable machine. Can it fail? Sure. But it won't fail because people aren't adopting it fast enough. All of those people will eventually look back and regret ignoring that conversation. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink. Edit: Unless you put the water in a bucket that dumps on their head every time they press a lever, with big sounds and flashy lights to tell them and everyone else how great they are for pressing said button.
Regardless, it was an interesting read.

Gource allows for something called ["file lag."]( I don't know what the OP used as his file lag setting or his number of days per second setting, but the default allows for a max lag of 5 seconds of video time. It creates a much nicer visualization at the cost of accuracy.

You're right, it is a big generalization. It is also a true generalization for basically every MMO out there. They are all designed to keep you clicking one month after another. WoW provides a bit more interesting content than the others that are free to play, but overall, they are based on the same premise. Free to play games urge their players to purchase items that will increase the speed in which they can play while subscription based games urge the player to play as long as possible, even if it means doing the same repetitive tasks for 90% of the time, but they still fall into the same bucket of games that feed on human behavior.
Also, I never called anyone a rat. I was simply describing the correlation between games like WoW and experiments such as [this]( We are all susceptible to conditioning. I don't know anyone that would admit that they enjoy paying for and playing games that condition them to complete repetitive tasks, which is why WoW players get so defensive when I suggest it.

I spend a lot of money on new games. My Steam catalog is pretty much endless. I don't really understand your point with this comment?
For someone that enjoys being psychologically conditioned to repeat the same tasks over and over again for $15/month (or whatever it costs these days), WoW is great, and more power to them, especially if they are able to balance real life with the constant desire for their guilds to schedule them on raids like it is a full time job.
With that said, I've known my fair share of people that treat the rest of the world as an extension of Azeroth, enough to have a pretty good idea of the lifestyles of those people posting on that forum thread. My wife and I used to argue about WoW all the time... the only argument she ever gave that I was willing to concede on is they have definitely built an awesome universe with a lot of great lore. But that doesn't change the fact their popularity is based more on behavioral psychology than actual enjoyment of the game, something that almost everyone I've known that has quit playing has realized in one way or another since.
Edit: Also, I understand the strong social connection that can be made at later levels in the game with raid groups and the like, and this is generally a positive thing I think and I do see the value in it at that point (paying for a social life, but whatever)... unfortunately, as I mentioned above, most of these groups operate like a corporation, or a giant family with sibling rivalry included, where those that aren't able to put in the time to complete their tasks are shamed by others or are punished by not being invited on the good ones.

My favorite argument against Bitcoin is that it is a ponzi/pyramid scheme. It is people like this guy that will be whining about that until the day he dies, that he wasn't lucky enough to be there when it started, when it was sitting there in front of his face the whole time and he chose to ignore it. Funny thing is that ALL forms of currency are in some way a pyramid scheme. The people that have the wealth first have a much easier time holding on to it. The advantage to Bitcoin in that area is that most people with a lot of Bitcoins have invested a lot of time and energy into a currency that has for a long time been disregarded as a joke by the financial world, and they deserve everything that is coming to them.
Here's to turning the pyramid upside down!
@_date: 2013-06-02 20:22:11
Teaching kids about money and the economy at an early age is EXACTLY what parents should be doing, and since most financial activities are restricted to those 18 and older, Bitcoin really is a very good learning tool and will prepare them for the real world they will meet when they get older. Not knowing how the world works is why people end up miles in debt when they get their first credit card.

Very cool. I recently reset my two year old public Minecraft server to run Feed the Beast with an entire economy based on Bitcoins with global buy/sell market and bitcoin deposit/withdraw. I should add a feature like this as well.

Difficulty is verified by the entire network, and it changes every 2 weeks based on the previous period's number of blocks. This is why it is so important that no one own 51% of the network's power. Doing so would mean they could agree as a group what Bitcoin represents. The hope is that someone that wants to destroy Bitcoin could never achieve that much compute power, and is the primary reason you see pool owners denying new members once they get to around 48%. They don't want to be the reason an illegitimate transaction wipes out a major source of income for them.

Also, may want to check out the [bitcoinaverage.com]( api as that is pretty much the same data that Coinbase uses to determine price, and it contains a whole lot more useful information.
@_date: 2013-06-01 05:48:22
This [diagram]( explains everything from start to finish. The part you don't understand is under "Verifying the Transaction." In short:
1. Every 10 minutes, the most recent transactions are bundled together with a non existent transaction to an address under your private key for 25 bitcoins (currently) into a block that contains the previous block's header hash and the merkle root (a hash of the current block's transactions). The extra transaction ensures that no two miners are working on the same problem, but are still equally difficult to solve.
2. The miners attempt to use the previous block's hash and their current merkle root combined with many different attempts at adding a random nonce to the data to get a hash that has X number of starting zeros (defined by the current difficulty).
3. When a miner finds a matching combination, they submit it to the blockchain, essentially, and if it is accepted by the rest of the network as properly solving the problem defined, it becomes an official part of the blockchain, including the 25 bitcoins in the transaction "created from thin air" that automatically get deposited into the wallet managed by your private key.
At least, that's how I understand it. Anyone else feel free to nitpick at my explanation if you have a deeper understanding. In my opinion, this is the most genius part of Bitcoin's protocol. ANYONE can create money from thin air, as long as they have a powerful enough machine to make it match the set of required specifications based on the current network difficulty. It is a truly distributed algorithm.
Oh, and because all blocks are based off information from the previous block, it is easy to see who was first. And only the first is accepted for that block. The rest of them just become additional confirmations that the transactions really did take place and are valid.
I'm a little hazy on the details of how pools work, but here's my educated guess: For pool miners, the owner of the pool dictates to the miners the current block of transactions, including the transaction created from their private wallet. All of the miners work on that problem just as if they created it themselves, and share the results with the owner's server. They are told what range of nonces to try. Each attempt at solving it is counted as a share, whether it is successful or not, and if someone does "win", then the owner signs the block and submits it (with their own transaction). If they receive the 25 bitcoins, they then distribute it to all the miners based on their shares in solving the problem. If a miner solves it, they have no choice but to submit it with the owner's transaction embedded because the hash they solved included it to begin with, and attempting to replace it with their own would mean they have a completely different problem to solve and would have to start over again, which keeps the miners honest in a pool. As for whether the pool owner will actually pay out after the fact, that is simply a question of who can you trust, and that is something that can be acquired pretty easily as you get fractions of winning bitcoins while never actually submitting a winning solution.
