Very desperate. You know why? There are a lot of talented people, working hard on Bitcoin right now and trying to make thing better. I do what I could do well and be part of the change. Yes, I am so desperate and excited about Bitcoin that I do something about it. The question is how desperate are YOU for leaving this comment?
