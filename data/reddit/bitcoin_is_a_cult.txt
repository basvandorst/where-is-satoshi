Lots of organic growth today guys. I know when I look at charts of real investments 3% gains in a matter of seconds based off of zero news is a sign of fundamentals and not market manipulation.

Except it doesn’t, because it will never gain mainstream adoption when the only use case outside of wild speculation is something no one except internet libertarians care about to begin w.


This is such a stupid statement idk how to even respond. You’ve clearly never opened even a basic economics/finance textbook. There’s way to value real assets based on basic principles of supply/demand and company fundamentals.

Yeah McAfee we know, “bubbles are mathematically impossible in this new paradigm”...

“It’s different this time” - shit people have said about every bubble in history. Also I hate to tell you this, but 99% of the people throwing money into crypto don’t give a shit about the libertarian principles behind it. They’re just looking to get rich quick. If you want to make a difference you’d be better off donating that money to Cato, Mises, Gun Owners of America, Rand Paul’s next presidential campaign, etc. Also it’s hilarious you’re using “it’s not a company” as a reason for it NOT being a bubble. Companies are at least backed by real tangible assets. Crypto is backed by pixie dust and blind faith.

Knew a lot of guys that said the same thing about Enron, Pets.com, etc and bought the whole way to $0. It’s obvious from posts like this how little investment experience this sub has.  This isn’t the first bubble and won’t be the last. Also lol @ “technically sound”
