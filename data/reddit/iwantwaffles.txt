Books, websites and years of screwing up and fixing mistakes.  At least that is how I did it.

Used support for a defective chromecast.  Was on the phone with someone within 2 hours and was emailing 2nd level support within 4 hours.  Got credit to order a new device that day.  Couldn't have been happier.

Give me my BTC back thief.
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:20:28
Mine didn't even come with one.  After two failed attempts to get one I realized I was probably better off.
@_date: 2013-07-17 02:32:34
It looks good. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 21:04:38
Come on...don't discourage lack of trust.  This sounds like a big bank "nothing to see here" response.  Bitcoins exist because we said "fuck you" to people that said that type of shit.
Always be skeptical OP.  Do your research.  Learn as much as you can even if it is over your head.  No one has ever been screwed because they were too informed.

Not what happened.  I have a later order which I'm fine with.  You said they were not shipping **anything** out of order which is false.  
Shipping Js before earlier orders was a shitty move on time sensitive investments.  They should have offered the early S and MS at least enough Js to fill their order and offer to swap when the S and MS where ready.

That thread was deleted.  Something doesn't seem right.  Probably a fake.
Edit: Looks like it is back.  Wonder when they will be in full production mode...
@_date: 2013-06-05 17:27:28
It appears so.  Apparently their trade data api is also down.  None of the tickers are reporting trades from before 18 mins ago of this comment.  This could be interesting.
@_date: 2013-06-13 18:29:04
They said they expect all of the pre-orders should be out the door within 100 days.  So Aug wouldn't be too far off.  Of course they have said a lot of things.  Just recently they seem to be a little better at their estimates.

Ah yeah that makes sense.  Having it on the same device would give some protection against key loggers but if your whole device is compromised then yes it wouldn't do much.
That being said there really isn't a reason not to set it up even if you don't have a yubikey or a smart phone.  You could put the offline html 5 app on a computer that is completely offline which would give the desired security.  Which is really what I was getting at.  I guess I didn't make it clear.

All other legitimate reasons aside I don't know why anyone let alone bitcoin enthusiasts would use would use Windows given the NSA ties Microsoft has.  Apple is probably just as bad.  Linux is open source which has the same effect as bitcoin in that it takes trust away from central authority and gives it to the community.
@_date: 2013-07-13 03:14:04
That just means they didn't know enough.

I think this seems way more logical than them shipping products to people that do charge backs.  They are almost that dumb but I don't think they are that short sighted.
@_date: 2013-06-04 20:24:00
I guess I am in the minority that has an order with BFL but still thought that was funny.  Maybe the sarcasm was too subtle?
@_date: 2013-09-16 21:22:48
It happens.  Do appreciate the the snotty comment though.
@_date: 2013-06-21 02:12:01
Posted this a while back with instructions on how to do it.
@_date: 2013-06-12 19:30:45
I give you permission to not do this then.
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:20:42
Well I would need some evidence of this.  If it were reliable then sure you can have my coins at last years rate.
@_date: 2013-09-14 03:01:54
I can't imagine this is true.  Was your projected ship date close to the blog?
@_date: 2013-09-12 03:18:09
The Ubuntu phone looks interesting.  But I'm not sure I'm willing to shell out $700 to try it especially when my Android phone is just shy of perfect.
@_date: 2013-12-28 04:17:39
Aren't as evil as they used to be.  When they could get away with it they were shitheads.

Also if you want to recover your key in the future you can take a screenshot of the QR code and recover it at any time or even put it on multiple devices.
Of course don't leave that screenshot unprotected.

I got the invalid cert with the "Proceed anyway" button when I accessed it with mobile.  Seems to be fine on my computer though.
@_date: 2013-05-24 01:49:01
Sounds legit
@_date: 2013-06-12 21:33:27
I don't know if I trust it.  I wouldn't mind seeing a shipped email from BFL to the person that is getting this.
@_date: 2013-09-12 03:24:03
I've thought about this too.  I could see a scenario where the protocol is used just to send fiat around like a glorified western union that can automatically do currency conversion.
But then the government and the big banks still have control and the appeal of bitcoin is severing those ties.  So as long as people find value in that then bitcoins  will most likely have value.

I think I saw a few on bitmit.  Going to give that a try.
@_date: 2013-06-09 04:05:25
They are.  The Js are the only thing shipping.  If you put in an order the first day for anything else then you are screwed.

I use coinbase.  Bought around $600 so far with no problems.  There is a little wait but it was easy to set up.  Also they allow you to setup recurring purchases.

Most likely the cgminer exe is modified to not use a conf file.  Wireshark should help you find out where the traffic is going.  Report him to the pool it ends up at.  Though it is likely he is running his own pool.
@_date: 2013-06-11 23:27:34
Yes it's true.

That is not even the most glorious feature.  I would put that in bottom 10 percent of features I appreciate from RES.

I would dump my coins if it was found out that the NSA created bitcoins and has a way to derive private keys from public keys. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 15:18:01
That is a fine question.  I hooked up GA and it still sends me an SMS code even though I don't use it.  They should give the option to remove SMS codes completely.
@_date: 2013-06-12 15:32:18
Can you elaborate?

Just wanted to say you are doing it right by being active in bitcoin online communities.  Thank you and I appreciate getting a direct voice from the company here.
