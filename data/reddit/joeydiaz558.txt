Great post , thank you for the information.

True , I would not risk it with a huge amount like that either . Another idea would be to seek someone who wants to cash out, use a 3rd party to escrow the transaction possibly.

When you formulate your trading strategy , are you just looking at historical data and combining that with news to gauge an entry point for trades ?

Would you put $1010 in it now , after what you have seen , if lets say that was 10% of your savings ?

I’m going to have to use the handicap stall on the morning of the fork, that way I can hold on.

I think a large number of said people are defending blockchain technology , but can not properly articulate their feelings and come across as just rooting for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:23:11
But isn't percentage the driving factor ? If I buy $500 of BTC or $500 of LTC and they move %10 , I make $50 either way. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:40:40
Haha!! 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:09:47
I never want to own less bitcoin , always more. It is just hard to get over the natural profit driven mentality. So to prevent myself from buying and selling , getting mad etc. I have decided to always buy for at least the next year or so.

I see your point . I look at the charts , just wanted to confirm my thought process is correct. Also , l understand the charts , but I’m really stuck on how to look and formulate my own opinion to say maybe “ I’m gonna buy at 6:30am because “ .

To prep myself for the fork , I look at my BTC/USD Value on Coinbase and multiply it by .30 , this way I am programing my brain to cope with that number. HODL
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:24:25
I see your point. My mind set has just been to buy only. I have a constant stream of disposable income I am putting towards bitcoin. Also, I do not trust my prediction enough to follow it into a sell/rebuy action. I trust my prediction far enough to mentally prepare to see a drop , and buy more then usual if it does dip as hard as my guess is.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:33:09
Ahhhhh thank you . Ok , I think that is what he meant too . Thank you both for explaining. I am a sharp person ( I think lol ) but I have been staring at this trying to figure it out for longer then I’d like to admit.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:18:29
I see that people day trade BTC , but why ? If the coin is constantly worth more each day , and even when it dips , it is worth more a few days latter then when you bought it. Why are the buy / sell ? Why not just buy it and hodl it ? I am trying to understand the benefits of day trading.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:26:20
But If I buy at 8K and it goes to 10K and I dont sell , it drops to 8K , then goes back to 11K then I have technically 3K in profit sitting there , so as long as the ATH is always rising , holding is the same ?
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:36:04
Ah ok , I see the path now.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:55:21
Let’s hope , I’ll sell at 10.5k and buy back in at 7.5k and increase my hodlings !

Use GDAX , no fees on limit orders , add funds to Coinbase from your bank , then move to GDAX.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:54:16
%100 Ditto lol . I save up a nest egg , already have the major electronics I want , bills are paid . Now to break up my day to day boredom , I have started pouring money into bitcoin . I get up in the Morning at watch it like a child all day long . It’s a great hobby !
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:54:17
I view GDAX on the toilet only each morning , for this reason.

Very similar for me. I quit drinking in July cold turkey and have not looked back . I spent 10 years on the booze train seeing the same things over and over. Now with my freed up income , rather then drinking it , I’m investing it. A Friday night now is spent reading about crypto currency. Fresh air !

I just figure I want to buy as much as I can , why would I want to buy BTC and then go back to Fiat ? when I can just buy BTC and my fiat value grows anyways ( Should I chose to need fiat ).
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:10:03
If you want to lock in the price , just make your purchase on Coinbase. The instant you place your order , you lock in the price you will be paying ( my last bank transfer order took 6 days )
