Bots can be old accounts too.
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:59:41
Except its still possible to upload to those 8 people you connect to. With only 8 outbound connections its hard to get a 100% seed ratio but its still possible.  You might be able to connect to a client with incoming connections that is downloading the block chain.
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:13:40
If you read on their terms of service they don't allow bots.
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:19:57
Well that's a valid use case for Bitcoin. You could buy some with your Canadian account.
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:57:06
This site is also good.
@_date: 2015-06-21 13:46:31
Unlike the OP's title.  Okcoin made the blog post, 9 hours ago.
And it's due to the data center being down. Not something they have control over. And many other businesses who also use the data center are also down.
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:47:43
The cash they hold would still be Euros. And that'd be worth more than Drachmas. The people with money in the banks would get Drachmas right? The people with Euro cash would do much better. This is also true for Bitcoin but Euro cash is just as good.
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:01:22
Got it.
There's no attack forks on the testnet? I would think it would be easy to cause a reorg and rewrite your own chain.
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:03:16
I wonder if the book Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas antonopoulos would be useful.
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:00:15
With credit cards, wouldn't you have to transfer your money into Greece which is fine?
EDIT: But it would probably go to their bank account which they can't withdraw from. They need to get it deposited into a non-greece bank account. Or delay it.
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:43:40


@_date: 2015-06-09 04:29:46
yeah multisig create a ton of transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:28:17
Coinbase, Circle.
Local Bitcoins, Mycelium Local Trader, Local ATMs.
@_date: 2015-06-09 02:16:20
that's awfully specific.  I don't think someone would have that indexed.  You'd need to download the blockchain yourself and search through it.
@_date: 2015-06-07 00:13:44
do you mean hijack bitcoin addresses?
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:27:06
Well that goes to my original point.  Just because the blocks limit is raised doesn't mean miners need to put all transactions in their blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-18 20:56:37
you're going to need a few days for processing.
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:54:08
How do you know you won't get orphaned because your block will take longer to propagate.
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:57:19
Just because there's more room doesn't mean miners need to accept all low fee transactions.  
@_date: 2015-06-29 05:10:00
The capital controls are still there, they still need to try converting to Bitcoin. And if they have cash already they're safe.
@_date: 2015-06-21 13:48:15
And Okcoin updated that it was Aliyun which was the problem quite early on.
@_date: 2015-06-23 02:39:16
It's withholding blocks so that you're the only one mining it so you get a head start.
@_date: 2015-06-20 06:12:14
If you have high enough priority (Sending high value and/or old coins) you should be able to get through even with low fee.
@_date: 2015-06-28 00:40:26
Yup it doesn't really matter if it's cash or Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:58:44
His goal is to uncover socks/manipulation but he just wants a thorough analysis of posts/comments. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 21:02:57
The fee market is not about replacing the block subsidy.  It's about a system for prioritising transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-15 06:43:34
Wouldn't they still have had to make the backend code themselves?  They're just trying to standardize the protocol so other sites can have an easier time integrating the API.
@_date: 2015-06-25 05:11:56
yeah the adoption of web wallets seems to be something else that couldn't be predicted.
Also Bitcoin is smaller than what people think it is.
@_date: 2015-06-27 18:39:00
BTM requires depositing cash, these people don't have cash.
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:15:19
There will be some people, and you should be getting more than 60 euros a day. There is also Greek BTMs which might have euros in them.
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:55:58
no it wouldn't be because the auditors can't connect to you.  (Unless you connected to an auditor randomly).  And then I think the auditors require open port 8333 to connect to you.
@_date: 2015-06-29 22:46:21
Do they have additional fees than vogogo? Or is it the same as for cryptsy and cointrader?

@_date: 2015-06-23 01:13:41


Regardless of 'propagation delay advantage' we will still be seeing more mining power in the future.
2) fees could rise and that would convince unhonest mining miners to add tx.  Also greedy mining is something different then what you mention. You can make more with greedy mining then with mining small blocks, a lot more.  I don't even think its comparable.
Also assuming a 90% dishonesty rate is quite ridiculous.
You're also assuming a rise in fees will cause the price to drop.

You aren't going to be able to get fiat onto an exchange in a private manner. That's true for almost all exchanges.
There's anonymous exchanges but those are if you don't need to withdraw or deposit fiat.
@_date: 2015-06-23 03:16:54
Search it up, there's many analysis's on the probability of profitability. You'd think you'd need 50% of the hashpower to do greedy mine but it's still effective with even only 30% of the global hashrate. If someone else releases a block you can release yours to try to win. But even if you lose that block, the rewards can be quite big. Because once you get two blocks, you can release the first block when you feel like it or you can keep on mining for a third block and release two blocks when someone releases one block.
@_date: 2015-06-27 02:03:15
uncertainty is great for an exchange, exchanges profit off of volatility
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:20:15
Paypal is totally currency. When you pay with paypal it just goes to their paypal account which they can keep indefinitely their. People are using paypal as a bank account instead of an actual banking institution.
Of course if you don't have funds in your paypal account you need to add via bank or credit card. But if you're sending paypal to someone in Greece you'll have no problem doing it and they'll be able to have full access to it.
But you won't be able to turn it into cash at a bank. But you can use it to pay for stuff in restaurants and shops. People accept paypal just like cash. And there are probably people on the street who'll be able to convert it into cash for you.
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:05:41
There's a lot of paypal hate, but paypal is actually working quite well for greeks. It can be freely transferred and they're not going to take a haircut on deposits their. Also a lot of people accept paypal.

Just because you accept incoming connections doesn't mean that you have the full blockchain.  You could be trying to bootstrap.  You could also be missing recent transactions as says.

It must've been all the rowing talk that kept the price afloat. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 00:39:56
Note that you still help relay blocks and transactions if your port 8333 is closed (just with only to the 8 clients you connect to).
@_date: 2015-06-17 06:06:51
Actually its due to FED interest rate fears.
@_date: 2015-06-30 03:01:40
His point could be extended to:
If Greeks have funds in Bitcoin or Google Wallet, Bitcoin is unnecessary.
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:15:21
You just pay all your employees in cash (or bonuses). That's laundering through them.
@_date: 2015-06-17 21:45:37
That'd be perfectly fine.
@_date: 2015-06-24 02:11:08
Hmm you're right but then download speeds shouldn't be that bad too.
I was thinking that the pipe was big enough but it wasn't getting routed the best but yeah that doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:06:37
What's the same?
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:18:17
Well I'm quite sure it's more than 50 people.
But regardless, I'm saying to convert Bitcoin to cash, and there are multiple ways to do that.
So you're saying that if you went to an ATM you could withdraw cash easily?
Also as you said before people accept paypal. I was under the assumption that you weren't able to get cash quickly with your bank account so I'm just saying alternatives like paypal, google wallet, bitcoin are all more liquid than bank account money. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 05:37:39
actually the correct term is Selfish mining.
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:49:45
You should be able to transfer Bitcoins to cash a lot easier in Greece, then trying to withdraw cash from your bank account.
This means instead of only buying 60 euro worth of diesel or tripe soup, you can buy as much as you want.
Anyways, it's offshore money, you can use Bitcoin to bring it in or you could use paypal or google wallet. Your bank account only get's you 60 per day, with any of the alternatives, it's in a form that isn't limited.
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:50:43
He's actually talking about the BIP 66 fork (not an attack fork).
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:52:30
Will they really be at a disadvantage?  Or will American miners be at a disadvantage because they aren't able to propagate to chinese miners.
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:59:11
He's talking about pools.
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:50:32
and they take 30s to propagate.
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:04:34
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:51:26
what I'm saying is that he had an issue trying to withdraw cash. And it was from a canadian bank account. Unlike greek bank accounts where you can't do international transfers. With a canadian bank account you can purchase bitcoins and then you could sell it for cash in greece.
Instead of a 60 euro limit, you can withdraw as much as you want.
And while Bitcoin is a solution, really Paypal or google wallet are also valid solutions.
@_date: 2015-06-12 11:50:07
My point is just that a fee market is still important even with a blocksize increase.  I'm not advocating 1 MB blocks like the other commenter. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 11:42:49
Time is multiplied by 1000.
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:56:07
Yeah I read somewhere before already that they sold btc in 100k (USD) chunks OTC.
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:51:15
I'm not really sure if this is a good idea.
Oldest coins will naturally have lower fees but if you can spend newer coins, why don't you?  Also if you're paying fees why don't you try consolidating some smaller transaction inputs?
Recently Bittrex had a problem with clam withdrawals.  They had so many dust outputs that they weren't able to make outgoing transactions without exceeding the tx limit.  While its nice to minimize transaction inputs you don't want to be left with a ton of them.  I would think it would be better to consolidate the small transaction inputs whenever you can so that you can get rid of them.
@_date: 2015-06-17 17:15:12
Yup 2.5k BTC total volume.  (More than any GBTC record)
[Google is helpful](
(Or you could divide Volume by 200)

@_date: 2015-06-21 07:01:22
@_date: 2015-06-15 11:27:38
It's probably true.  There are OTC markets where people trade big amounts of Bitcoins and fiat.
@_date: 2015-06-20 13:35:34
It is surely not a bot.  Not only is good good at detecting this stuff but faking 10x normal search volume seems hard.

@_date: 2015-06-28 00:39:47
And capital controls for inflows should be quite lax.
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:13:25
Well those are held offshore so they won't be affected if the greeks change to drachma.
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:56:59
2) Of course there is going to be more mining power in the future. But does that mean people are going to be mining at a loss? I don't see that happening anytime soon.
3) When the coinbase transactions fall, will the miners have enough of an impact to be able to crash the price? Number three doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2015-06-19 01:52:15
Your quote took the statement out of context.
When they say a government whose primary duty is to protect its citezens,
they're also referring to money laundering, terroist financing, cyber-crime, digital exchanges going bankrupt and price volatility.

Basically the whole point of the seed in a HD wallet is that you always generate the same private keys if you use the same seed.  
@_date: 2015-06-30 07:25:36
Well there might be demand for bitcoin and the only way for someone to be able to buy bitcoin is if Bitcoin gets sent in. I'm not sure if people are clamoring to sell Bitcoin, you might even get a premium.
Anyways paypal is actually a really good digital currency also that people use, and it's a lot more liquid.
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:39:26
really, if they kept their money in cash they would've been just as fine.
@_date: 2015-06-27 02:05:51
I think he is talking about when fees get high to prohibit transactions not when they become something significant for miners.
@_date: 2015-06-17 04:47:42
Or maybe its FED interest rate fears.
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:56:33
It's actually quite an easy switch for them. They just partnered with Vogogo which is a payment intermediary for many other exchanges like cryptsy and cointrader.net .  They're actually doing quite well getting all this business.
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:43:07


I don't think this is a good idea.  I can see there being legal trouble.
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:25:16
According to this, by default it relays only 15kB of free transactions per minute
@_date: 2015-06-12 19:51:58
Transactions with older coins can be sent for free.  There's a threshold though.  It makes sense spam wise because you can't keep spamming old coins.
I think the correct formula is in the wiki.
@_date: 2015-06-20 07:03:45
Its a combination of coin age and size.
@_date: 2015-06-28 07:14:57
Yup and they also won't tell you to invest in gold. Unlike gold and Bitcoin, traditional investments are in equity of a company that's goal is to make money. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 18:46:16
you barely take up valuable spots.  Are clients nowadays reaching max incoming connections?
Also you still seed by only doing outgoing connections.  It's just a lot harder to get a 100% seed ratio.
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:43:55
Well usually they only keep a part of their profit margin in bitcoins.  Above that you're taking an unnecessary risk.
@_date: 2014-07-05 07:52:57
Yup JD was the best Bitcoin investment scheme.  And the only one I made money off of.  And dooglus made a lot of money off of it too.  He really needs to get it started again.
And you should really watch out with buying securities.  It's nothing like investing in JD.
The best place to invest Bitcoin would be bitfinex.  But they have crap interest rates, unless that changed now.  It's because they have low volume and high amount of supply.  US has a good return on their, but two much Bitcoin on their, and everyone is long anyways so its hard to lend it out.
@_date: 2015-06-14 14:13:13

Now it sounds like the zimbabwe dollar
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:48:54
One problem is lookup time.  I think that is a significant factor.  If you hashed a passkey you also need to look it up on the blockchain to check for any bitcoins.  That look up time takes awhile.  that's why if you're just trying to crack a smaller set of addresses its easier.
@_date: 2014-03-31 23:58:40

The issue I feel is that if they're all the same it isn't necessary to use Bitcoin.  Here's an analogy of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is like a ponzi scheme.  Every time someone buys in then the other people who owned coins benefit.  They gain wealth because someone else puts wealth in.  I'm not saying Bitcoin is a ponzi but what I mean is that people may feel like putting their wealth into another coin.

This means you won't know if there were already bitcoins on your address and that a collision was found.
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:21:40
but they have a gigantic market cap because its mainly pre-mined and the rest of the coins are off the market.  :P
@_date: 2014-12-14 14:07:26
You're saying only the value of bitcoin determines the incentive to mined.  And all that matters is that they cover their costs.  But really you need to consider the value of the block reward to understand if they can cover their costs.
@_date: 2014-03-31 05:01:06
Thanks, its an interesting thread.  Yeah I really want to allow incoming connections because I'm also helping the network more.  But I think that if you only have 8 connections you're still helping the network a bit.  Once you establish those connections it goes both ways.  You sort of act as a link between the supernodes.  And the supernodes aren't connected to everyone.  So I think its not exactly leaching with 8 connections, but more is better.
And lol to all the people saying Bitcoin Core isn't bandwidth intensive after you download the whole block chain.

well it might mean that 0 conf transactions are slightly less trustworthy.
But people could offer pools that did the opposite with 0 fees.
I think if pools disclosed that they used the first come transaction policy then retailers could send the transactions along to these trusted nodes.
Basically it comes down to greedy mining.  Is this ethical?  because profit wise, miners who use this pool will make more (very little now though).
(Greedy mining is when you withhold blocks)

And I'm really iffy about their "trading strategies."  Unless they'll be using more aggressive tactics because they have such a large holdings.  But then it'll be harder to close your position.  I think its just hard to use trading strategies.
Also, how do you have "fully-insured cold wallet storage" if you're actively trading.  That doesn't make sense.  You can't have your Bitcoins in cold storage if you're actively trading (Unless you set up your own exchange).

@_date: 2014-03-31 05:06:12
Yeah, its funny those people who say that Bitcoin Core isn't bandwith intensive after you download the blockchain.  But its true that its not bandwidth intensive.  The majority of the uploading probably comes from updating the blockchain for peer while relaying transactions shouldn't use up so much data.
One suggestion might be to enable more features for home users who have limited upload bandwidth.  Maybe something like limiting upload bandwidth for uploads of the blockchain (beyond a certain point).  But you'll still function as a node to propagate blocks and transactions.  This will allow your node to function more as a node, not a download site for the blockchain.  It'll make blockchain updating slower but you could still update the last two days of the blockchain at full speed.  It would encourage getting the bootstrap.  That's a good idea because you'll just be downloading from people with lots of bandwith.

@_date: 2014-03-08 21:08:19
Well there is one difference.  Dogecoin is a scrypt coin while Bitcoin is sha-256.  It might actually be smart for msi to adopt dogecoin as they would be catering towards their market (people who buy graphic cards).  I think with the price increases so far we can attribute the scrypt coin community as having a lot of buying power.
The only problem is that the dogecoin market cap is quite small, and I don't think there is much exchange volume.  Bitcoin is better suited for these big transactions.

Yeah, and I think this is healthy for the crypto community as it allows the network to absorb more wealth.
Instead of people investing in Bitcoin, people invest in Altcoins.  Of course this may be why Bitcoin users are unhappy but this is just the market doing its thing.  If people only invested in Bitcoin then the price would always skyrocket benefitting the initial investors a lot.

What if the other nodes don't talk to each other?  There are a lot of nodes out there.  It's impossible for a node to connect to every single other node.  If you had only nodes allowing incoming connections then people would have on average 16 connections.  But a full node can support more than 16 connections.  That makes it okay for some people to allow only outgoing connections (though its not desirable).
So from this knowledge it means that the network can support nodes that don't allow incoming connections.  And I suppose its good to have these nodes.  It's better than nothing.  I think these nodes still help to strengthen the network.
@_date: 2015-05-18 05:54:04

Spreads are a bit big on vanilla options.  Currently there's no market for writing options, market maker bids are all lowballs.
As for the asks, they're only good if you think there's going to be a big move.
Binary options are a bit easier to play around with because you don't need to wait for big moves.
Hopefully vanilla options will get tighter spreads or more liquidity.  And then a VIX product would be really cool.

they have to decide which transactions go in first.  This is why proof of work works, because it means exactly those certain transactions need to go in the block.
You have to hash it with a nonce, or hash the block and add a nonce then hash that.  Anyways there's a nonce that you can change.
And then you keep trying with a different nonce until you get a block with the acceptable number of zero's at the beginning.

I think you sign it with your private key and get a signature. And you can use that with a public key to prove you own it
So basically if you can break cryptography you get a million dollars.  With infinite computing power you can forge his digital signature and get a million dollars.

yeah offchain networks aren't close to ready yet for consumer use (size).  And we have also seen the decline of centralized web wallets, now we have web wallets where users have much more control but that means you can't implement off chain transactions.
Actually we have changetip which is quite a successful offchain service.

I see but that would be quite illegal.  And it would be even more illegal for seeders accept money.  Unless we're talking about regular torrents but very gray area.
You're right though, I was thinking about integrating BitTorrent into Bitcoin to scale up to more transactions but I was thinking that wouldn't be feasible.
@_date: 2015-01-19 22:25:44
that'd mean you'd need to wait a few blocks for confirmation of the 6th block.  What should be secure enough?
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:09:23
Wow, all these places accept bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:03:32
They get exchange fees but you might also be borrowing Bitcoins from someone and you'll have to pay interest on that.  And the exchange might also take a portion of that interest.
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:41:56
well changetip likes to use long chains.
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:43:41

@_date: 2015-05-14 21:15:00
Hmm, I'm not really sure if volume will ramp up.  Even though its tradeable, its like GBTC shares are getting siphoned off into portfolios, IRAs, etc.  Reducing supply.
@_date: 2015-05-19 07:22:46
yeah I don't see why they need to integrate Tether.
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:25:13
I'll be sending to this address.  You can see some controls from before the stress test.  0.1 mbtc fees.
Sent a transaction at:
* -60
* -52
* -36
* -29
* -19
* -14
Actually 0.01 mbtc fee now. Let's see how long it'll be in limbo.
@_date: 2015-05-18 07:26:50
Well a bit of a delay (ticker).  But Volume has already surpassed Day 1 GBTC volume within 30 mins.
@_date: 2015-05-22 11:49:39
what do you mean?  What other addresses did they send to?
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:55:19
Note that you can only send one transaction per output.
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:46:09
So blue is transactions (bitcoins in limbo?)
Red are outputs, place where coins are being sent.
Green is inputs.
Yellow would be change addresses.
And you can see people sending to the same output. (red center)
Or blue center is a bulk transaction.
Or the long chains because (using unconfirmed inputs)
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:50:21
Yes, I know that the existence of unconfirmed transactions doesn't mean blocks are full.

actually a lot more than 5000 txs unconfirmed.  They have some math errors.
But actually they weren't able to sustain the transaction.  180-300 tx per minute in the last 10 minutes.
Also of the 2500 transactions that got confirmed (less than 10%), 13000 btc worth of transaction got confirmed (&gt; 60%).
I'm not sure how much fees you needed to pay to get in that block.
@_date: 2015-05-04 04:07:53
According to the link it looks a lot higher than that.
@_date: 2015-05-25 16:12:31
one would expect average block sizes to be less, not necessarily half.
You can also look at the backlog of unconfirmed transactions, I'm quite sure they're not all in the blocks.

On okcoin there is two types of shorting.  You can borrow coins for spot margin trading.  With that you can have up to 3x leverage.  But it will cost you the regular trading fees and also interest.
You can also short via futures.  You should read up how that works.  With futures you're making a contract with another person.  And with that you can short up to 20x.

By decline he's talking about a decrease in donations to the winner.
But there isn't really enough of a sample size yet.
is not a lottery.  People don't have the obligation to give.  They have the choice whether to give $1 or more than that if they are feeling generous for this special person.
  
Another thing is that people do not want to donate to a user that is an alt account.  Currently only 10% of people who submit their name for the drawing actually donate.  This means that there it is quite likely that you're donating to someone who never was planning to donate.
And that's where some people disagree whether you should just donate because $1 doesn't mean a lot or if you should care about who you're donating too.  Does it matter that they might be an alt, but just donate anyways because that's the point of the sub?
So there are people out there who are willing to donate no matter what the account looks like.  And this means that there can be a lot of accounts being made to enter the contest.  And they may even be able to create accounts that look a lot more believable than real lurkers.
Anyways, when OP is talking about 'decline' he's talking about a decrease in donations.  We have a small sample size on that.  And just because there's this slight backlash, we won't know how little donations this person will be getting.

So first you might start investing a lot into mining companies and other Bitcoin companies that will profit from a price move and increased growth.
Then you would start buying a ton of contracts on futures.  There's not a ton of liquidity but just start buying whatever you can.  Maybe you would be able to accumulate a 100,000 contracts.  And then buy a ton of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:48:53
You're saying they 'take' money.  They're also providing liquidity.  I don't see anything wrong with that.  Also its not risk free.  Risk/reward may be slightly skewed

Of course all trades are break even.  But I think there's a difference between day traders who help provide liquidity and people who just portion off a part of their paycheck into Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-04-29 20:52:58
Okay do you have any proof to back it up?
Also etoro uses CFDs for their stocks and Bitcoin.
1broker also uses CFDs.
Just because they use CFDs doesn't mean that they aren't hedging the bets you make.
And they might be banned from the US because you're not allowed to trade CFDs in the US.

eToro is for trading.  I'd assume you'd be able to use leverage also.
They also have this follow feature.  So traders who have good past performance will have people who follow their trades.  So if that person bought Bitcoin, all their followers would also buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-06 13:52:22
traders make money by helping provide liquidity.  Trading can certainly be a non zero-sum game as there are market participants who just buy when they feel like it or sell when they feel like it.

@_date: 2015-04-27 03:13:18
Ah got it.  Anyways I think I think the point of that sub is not about being a lottery.
And if people want to gamble in an actual lottery there are a lot of implementation using pure Bitcoins.
That's another bonus of the donating aspect.  You can use paypal.

why do you block ads on reddit?
@_date: 2015-04-27 22:23:39
Looks like you have no evidence to support your claims.
@_date: 2015-04-02 22:09:18
I also said they provide liquidity which does not mean additional selling pressure.  It means it helps lower spreads to help facilitate people who want to buy or sell Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:52:50
I don't see different fees for bidask on kraken.  Bitstamp and goxx also have sane fees for bid ask.  Bitfinex and okcoin Intl both use maker taker
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:56:00
Hah the only good western exchange is basically bitfinex.  And okcoin Intl doesn't have a ton of volume yet.  And Chinese exchanges are extremely relevant especially okcoin China.  They might even lead the markets a majority of the time
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:12:24
posted in a bit before the article was released.
If any of you read term sheet, this is just a copy pasta:
Circle Financial, the bitcoin wallet startup led by Brightcove founder Jeremy Allaire, is in the midst of raising around $40 million in new VC funding at around a $200 million pre-money valuation, according to multiple sources. Don't be surprised if an announcement comes later this week, with both VC and Wall Street-type investors attached. The Boston-based company previously raised $26 million, including a $17 million Series B round in March 2014.
@_date: 2015-04-27 03:22:45
I agree that a pure blockchain solution is a lottery.
What shitstorm are you talking about?
@_date: 2015-04-06 05:46:34
Yeah he's trying to use the greater fool theory
@_date: 2015-04-27 01:01:15
This is obviously not the reason but does anyone have info on LBC?  I probably shouldn't send byc right?
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:28:47
woah watching price charts are fun.  Maybe you need to use more leverage.
(also maybe you shouldn't, wouldn't want to get rekt)
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:27:28
so you need to develop a front end game that looks like a game.
And yeah if I developed this it would be bear vs bulls, and you can only open longs if its bullish, shorts if its bearish.
@_date: 2015-03-26 15:34:31
Really I think its just a test right now.  They're not actually buy at that price.
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:42:29
yeah I don't have the answer to this.  But you'll be able to for sure with the ETF.
@_date: 2015-03-18 02:58:19
If its stolen money you should be still safe from any law problems (like for nodes) and you that's the point of escrow
@_date: 2015-03-01 21:30:02
You can invest in BIT.
EDIT: need to be accredited according to website.
But WSJ says this might allow anyone to buy BIT OTC (might be wrong)
@_date: 2015-03-02 23:01:23
There's lots of services based in the UK.
There might be some new ones (I don't live in the UK).
Putting it in a wallet is like storing it your self. You might be asking web wallet vs the other ones.
Check this.  
Usually wallet services don't sell bitcoins.  Sometimes exchanges offer wallet services (like coinbase).

not sure how safe that would be.
You might need a gas tank on the way up and down.
@_date: 2015-03-20 08:54:55
Its because Bitcoin us decentralized.

Interesting, 300 people are also going to be attending a conference in toronto tomorrow too.
@_date: 2015-03-20 04:06:44

you probably need to be an accredited investor.
EDIT: you don't
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:54:14
They buy from mining and also big chunks OTC
@_date: 2015-03-09 06:16:00
Cryptsy?  I found cryptsy's verification to actually be a lot easier than other sites.
Anyways verification is there for a variety of reasons.  It's to protect the exchange against fraud as some payments can get reversed.  It is also for regulation to protect themselves from any money laundering they may get charged for.
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:09:33
Ugh, I don't think this would work on chain.
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:28:34
Time to start up my CPU miners again.
@_date: 2015-03-06 21:20:50
Well I've seen it moving around.
@_date: 2015-03-06 20:26:25
Yeah, but I also meant the bottom half being more shaded in makes a lot of sense.  The older addresses would have sent to older addresses a lot more frequently than newer addresses.  That's why the bottom half of the triangle is a lot more shaded.
@_date: 2015-03-17 04:56:24
They're talking about your individual bank account.  You could've possibly cancelled your payment and scammed them out of Bitcoins.  It probably happens frequently enough.

What they sort of mean is that bitfinex currently doesn't have a lot of liquidity.  Currently if you want to go long there is a lot of interest.  And I think BTC.sx might have there own liquidity fiat pools to lend to there users but currently they have none left (maxed out).  During times like this it might be better to go long on futures at [OKCoin]( because you won't need to pay swap fees.  You'll also have access to more leverage.
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:07:13
























@_date: 2015-03-03 02:10:48
True, while its worth 0.1 bitcoins there might be a premium or discount.  You have to take into the 2% yearly fee as a premium.  But your Bitcoins would be insured and you would be able to put Bitcoins in an investment vehicle.  After that's taken into account the market may put a premium or discount on the price.
@_date: 2015-03-12 06:38:03
are these transactions happening offchain?
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:38:08
Yes labelling addresses would be nice.  So we don't need to do all this speculation
@_date: 2015-03-10 03:44:59
I see, so this is an article for people who like to use HYIP ponzis about the benefits of Bitcoin.

slightly different, with fiat system the government can print more making everyone's money worth less.
With Bitcoin, as user adoption grows the thieves will also profit.  And you could also say that the growth of Bitcoin market cap would be funding thieves.
@_date: 2015-03-07 01:36:21
hah!  That's a 4% fee.

I've heard of lots of people who've used bitwage.co  
@_date: 2015-03-05 16:25:56
Meh , what they added is similar to plex in Eve online.  It's quite a smart move.  Though it d be great if three accept bitcoin as a payment method
@_date: 2015-03-10 22:16:28
yeah they took a really hard look on that twitter account.
@_date: 2015-03-04 23:47:05
The micropayments should be fine if you don't spend them for awhile.  Any you can use low priority fees for those. 
And I think a 1mBTC fee may be sufficient.
@_date: 2015-03-01 02:56:29
you can also post something in bitcointalk
@_date: 2015-03-02 22:47:10
You need to use %.
@_date: 2015-03-22 18:37:17
nope, couldn't you still have two transactions both signed against the latest block? (with same input)

what if there bid didn't get accepted.  They might want to buy more.
@_date: 2015-03-10 22:48:40
A good day would be when the Genesis Block was mined.
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:13:25
It might take awhile for shares to be deposited in there accounts.
@_date: 2015-03-05 08:40:35
it's secret bid.
@_date: 2015-03-13 15:29:30
increase demand for Bitcoin, therefore an increase in price.
@_date: 2015-03-04 12:53:42
Also client side seeds
@_date: 2015-03-08 05:34:39
the exchange would be denominated in Bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-03-05 06:47:20
Yeah I think its quite indexed already.  Search most Bitcoin addresses and you'll be easily able to get a google result to a block explorer for that address.
@_date: 2015-03-16 23:06:01
why would they plug BitPay?
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:43:33
with the recent update there's no need for bootstrapping.

Cause people are still speculating right now.
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:42:12
I think the 27k is still owned by the fed.  The 20k first received a 0.05 test balance from another 44k owned by the fed.  
@_date: 2015-03-02 16:28:28
you can also use an investment vehicle for it.  That way you won't need to pay taxes on capital gains.

yeah bitcoinwisdom has something like that.  But you could always try making it.  People don't know what they want.  I put together 4 bitcoinwisdom charts together so I don't flip between them.

That info has been around for a bit on other sites.
@_date: 2015-03-02 17:38:45
0.1 BTC.  It's a super lowball trade cause they got to place the first bid.  Not really seeing much right now.
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:30:32
Wow this makes quite a bit of sense.  The sloped lines are actually straight
@_date: 2015-03-02 23:24:19
Yeah you'd probably want to store it in a desktop wallet.
You can see the options in the page I linked and the pros and cons.
Sometimes you can encrypt it and have a password.  So you would store a backup on something like dropbox or gmail. (Instead of just your hard drive)  
And 1 bitcoins would put you ahead of a lot of people.

@_date: 2015-03-22 18:48:00
ahh you're talking about people who use low fees.
And it doesn't really matter about the nodes.  A miner could include the double spend transaction whenever they want.

People were buying with borrowed money.  It wasn't sustainable.
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:39:42
I think Bitfinex and Coinbase have different purposes.  Bitfinex is more tailored towards traders with its margin trading.  I don't think Coinbase has plans for margin trading and its more for expanding its business and offering users other ways of buying Bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-03-10 05:49:14
nice that you have a solid info.  I hope its a good warning to people.  Looks like you're waiting on a lot of people to pay.
@_date: 2015-03-16 03:16:32
yes there is a sms text verification.  
@_date: 2015-03-06 22:32:01
okay they aren't going to put an absurd premium but they would've placed solid bids.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:16:09
Miners still accept 1mb blocks if other people use them.
And before we go to 20mb blocks there are going to be some changes.  Like when miners find a block they just need to propagate headers.  This will enable faster propagation and less risk for miners to use big blocks.
@_date: 2015-03-06 23:04:20
They didn't get this news from the US Marshals.  They got the news because they were personally contacted.
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:54:33
tons of liquidity.  It would be hard to buy this many bitcoins on an exchange.
@_date: 2015-03-12 17:08:00
yes obviously price would rise.  And the future influx of capital would also get priced in and the price would rise more.
@_date: 2015-03-13 15:28:54
I haven't gotten any offers for my ad yet.
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:20:00

aren't those the size of your phone?
@_date: 2015-03-07 02:15:59
they've went to market in the past too.  The Second Market Bitcoin Investment Trust is different from the Second Market Syndicate.  When they won last time it was for the group of bidders that combined together not the trust.

@_date: 2015-03-03 11:37:45
Interesting.  What happens when new shares get added?
You're right it might depreciate below 2%.  But the tax savings from the capital gains might be worth it for you.

Multisig isn't a the solution to everything.  It's good for wallets.  But this isn't a wallet.  
@_date: 2015-03-27 00:43:40
After they issue shares it takes a year before they can be traded OTC.  COIN should be a lot better when it comes out, but so far we have no sign of that happening.
@_date: 2015-03-21 15:54:13


@_date: 2015-03-10 05:18:46
oh sry
@_date: 2015-03-27 04:41:49
You've got a great idea!  Sounds exciting.  Good luck on your venture, if you get big enough you'd be able to transfer to something like coinbase.
It's also something like localbitcoins, and I don't think they have that in Africa.  Lots of potential.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:07:33
well they recently used those coins to send a 0.05 test transaction to the 20k winner.
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:25:23
Interesting, like the safe holding the third key of multisig.

All BIT filings.
And here's COIN's filings just for info.

Second Market Syndicate.  (It's a group of buyers).  Someone in another syndicate said they bid 10% below spot and didn't get any blocks.  Search it up.  You'll find more info.
@_date: 2015-03-27 03:01:58
This looks exactly like goabra.com
And he never says BTC but he's talking about BTC.  All the sites that accept it are Bitcoin sites.
I'm not exactly sure how balances work and what your money is stored as.
Also who's behind this site?  Careful with your Debit and Credit card info.
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:28:00
@_date: 2015-03-09 05:17:12
I don't think people want to bid for their rides.
@_date: 2015-03-07 05:19:25
They could always sell and rebuy Bitcoin or new shares.
@_date: 2015-03-04 23:57:37
Localbitcoins is a peer to peer marketplace.  You can find offers for people willing to buy and sell coins within your country or city with a payment method that suits you.  Fees may be slightly higher.
Coinbase does two things.  They have the brokerage part where they buy and sell bitcoins at prices they set.  They also have an exchange where you can trade Bitcoins.  This is when you set the price you want.
You can buy and sell Bitcoins really fast.  What you're talking about is trading.  It might take a bit of time to transfer your Bitcoins to an exchange but then you can sell it.  There are many exchanges that facilitate trading.  While coinbase is an exchange you might be able to find more liquidity and volume at exchanges like Bitfinex and Okcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-01 21:25:31
BIT will be able to be publically traded.

Interesting pgp key links.
@_date: 2015-03-02 01:03:03
To invest in BIT currently.  But the way wsj puts it, the OTC stuff might be open to anyone.
@_date: 2015-03-29 21:16:22
maybe its because you have a modem and a router
@_date: 2015-03-02 00:05:27

@_date: 2015-03-10 16:58:55
yeah, we just need to trust that it looks like a deposit address for Bitfinex.
@_date: 2015-03-03 04:37:29
I think you're the one that is confused.  There's the SecondMarket Bitcoin Investment Trust but there is also the Second Market where you can buy and Sell Bitcoin OTC.

Maybe something to do with the Great Firewall of China.

Some people might be mistaken about ripple is.
Before what we see it now it used to exist in another form.  And it was used as something like a peer to peer payment system.  Where you give trust to people.  And people can be connected through trust networks.  It's quite interesting.
And then the version you know of today was implemented.  And XRP is 'premined' but it doesn't really need to have any value, you just need a small amount for making accounts and stuff.

I don't use it but I think their primary business is as a gateway and they do a good job doing that. But there v may be better options for hot wallets.

@_date: 2015-03-02 22:34:32
Yeah you should try to buy some bitcoins yourself.  That way you can also use it and it should be more liquid too.
This fund is more if you're not a tech person or you want to invest in it using a vehicle (tax breaks).
@_date: 2015-03-08 05:42:36
I think the hardest part of implementing something like this would be the matching engine.  I would think that it would be quite slow.  
I think we can take BFX for example.  They have fees unlike the chinese exchanges.  During low volatility periods there is little volume.  And they usually end up just following china even though they have a lot of liquidity on their books.
I think a slow matching engine will be unable to sustain a platform for decentralized price discovery.  It'll lead to big spreads to protect risk.  Big spreads means lower volume and this really won't be of much use as a decentralized price discovery platform.

@_date: 2015-03-03 02:16:02
Well really its another way of getting money into Bitcoin.  It might be easier for some people to buy Bitcoin through your broker.
Secondly one of the main reasons is that you can put this in an investment vehicle.  You might not be thinking about paying taxes on Bitcoin capital gains but if it gets big you won't be able to hide it.  And that's quite a substantial savings.

One thing to note from looking at this address is that it looks a lot like a deposit address.  That's because the coins are constantly getting sweeped.  Sweeped with other bitfinex deposit addresses and also withdrawing to the cold wallet or for withdrawals.
This is what the site thinks the hotwallet is made up of.
And I think this would be the cold wallet.

horizontal lines, popular services.  Vertical lines, addresses that are reused a lot and lots of money.  Maybe exchange cold or hot wallets.
EDIT: One thing to note is the inverse.  Some of these vertical and horizontal lines might be closely related.
 So if you have a lot of volume eventually a line might form. maybe?
 But dice sites will obviously be on there.
 Early addresses receive a lot of transactions?  My guess would be the dust spam, sob stories.
 Sloping lines might have something to do with mining pools.

Is there anything wrong with debt?  Yes wars were funded by debt.  And it might of been the reason why some people were able to win the wars.  Money is power.  The debt was influential for winning wars.
The good thing about debt back then was that it was mainly domestic.  We had stuff like victory bonds during the world wars, but it really dates much further back.  And domestic bonds weren't that bad.

Note that you don't actually win 20 BTC.
EDIT: To clarify you win an account that allows you to have 20 Bitcoin collateral.  But basically it works out that they give you leverage on your trading balance so you get more collateral than you actually have.  And in addition you get up to 5x leverage on the equities.
I think that's quite a bit different than winning 20 bitcoins.

Nice writeup.  Note that the orderbook doesn't always mean a lot.  And another good way to find support and resistance is to looks for horizontal support and resistance from the past.  And also note that support can become resistance and resistance can become support from breaking through it.
Also there's two nice tools the line that you can use for drawing trend lines and also the fibonacci retracement tool that you can use for calculating retracements.
Another indicator that I like is the BBands.  It shows when price is getting squeezed in a tighter range and also shows breakouts which means big movements.
I use  so that I can look at 4 charts at once.  Good exchanges to look at are Bitfinex, Okcoin BTC/CNY and Huobi.  You can also add btc-e or bitstamp.
Another site that people use is cryptowat.ch which is quite similar.  I find that there depth chart is slightly worse but they have a lot more charting tools and stuff like ichimoku clouds that I know traders like to use.

so you'd show your hash of the block for proof you did the proof of work and you'd send parts of the txids of all the transactions in your block.  Nodes would be able to recreate the block and hash it to make sure it matches the hash the miner sent out.  And it'll be a valid block if it passes the difficulty level.
This makes it easier for the blocks to propagate.  The transactions have 10 minutes to propagate through the network.  But you're able to propagate any found blocks through the network quickly.

Are there going to be any limits?  quickbt had a limit of 0.2 bitcoins.  And I think the fee is also quite steep.  A 2% fee sounds awesome.  Is quickbt also planning on changing their fee structure and limits?
EDIT: oops, realized it's for selling Bitcoins.
Anyways good luck with the business.  Maybe you'll start getting significant volume so you can be someone like coinbase.

nope running a full node does not guarantee you would be safe.  Someone would still need to mine a block and include your transaction in the block.  Before that a malicious entity could possibly forge a transaction and that could possibly get mined first.

I have no idea for implementation but basically it's like any other service out there.  You host one big wallet on your server.  (Hot wallet +cold wallet please) and generate deposit addresses when people ask.  Also allow for generating new deposit addresses. Register btc that gets sent to there account.  When they withdraw you can just ask for an address and you subtract a miner fee and send it from your wallet.  You could also allow for deposits and withdrawals from off chain services. (Coinbase change tip) 
@_date: 2015-02-20 20:21:46
Bitcoin isn't really HFT so you don't really need to worry about bots in that sense.  Also what you're doing is range trading which is really good in a ranging market.  But if there's a breakout you'll get rekt.  Make sure you zoom out, plot key support and resistance lines and also trendlines.  Don't just choose arbitrary entry points.  Also there's the thing where you let your profits run and cut your losses early.  You're doing the exact opposite.  You cap your profits and you let your losses run.
Also if you want to really make money you should be trading futures with leverage.

Just to let you know, just-dice has reopened, they're using an alt coin called clams.  The distribution of clams is ~4.6 clams to all non-dust Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin addresses.  It's also Proof-of-Stake, with a target of 1 block per minute.  So Just-Dice investors now also get stake rewards and tx fees.  Dooglus also added another feature to claim offsite coins (leverage).  This allows you to take on more risk as an investor.

I don't really have that much experience with wire transfers.
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:25:57
It sort of positive.  It means for every full node there's 3 other nodes that don't have open connections.  But I think they still help facilitate the network and provide bandwidth and some support.  It means that while we have the number of active nodes on the bitnodes page, we could multiply it by 4 for the number of active bitcoin clients running at any one time.
(Also does this count SPV clients, or do they have to connect to special nodes?)

@_date: 2015-02-27 05:43:26
I think time averages are fine.  The OTC markets might be more liquid.

Litecoin has the second highest market cap currently.  It's quite similar to BTC.  But it uses a different PoW algorithm and blocks are a bit faster.  There's going to be 4x supply of Litecoins.  Litecoin usually follows Bitcoins price movement and there is a bit of potential for upside.  Some people might want to buy a coin that's cheaper.
If you believe in Darkcoin that's great.  I'm just saying you might want to be careful because it was recently pumped and the price may slide down for a bit.
Another thing about Litecoin is that it has a ton of exchange infrastructure.  Bitfinex with long and shorting opportunities and Okcoin with futures (albeit low volume).  And there's btc-e.  Litecoin probably won't be disappearing anytime soon.
But currently 0% of my holdings is in Litecoin.  Currently using capital for trading.

Bitcoin Foundation needs to buy a private Island somewhere.  And then they can qualify as a government that has full faith in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:58:41
Yup, I was like why invest in Bitcoin when you can invest in Bitcoin securities!  So litecoinglobal, right after I invested in a managed porfolio the whole site crashed.  I also invested in BTCInvest run by tradfortress, well didn't get any money back.  And I also did a mining investment on Batch 3.  That wasn't that bad almost break even.
Best thing would be just-dice.com.  I lost a lot of bitcoins through investing but I finally just broke even again.
But, yeah I don't even own that much btc but this whole thing has been a great learning experience.  I didn't go all in so that's great.  And I made a bit off of FTC.  But, then I always felt it would go higher on the opening day of markets on btc-e (same with PPC).  So, big learning experience on scams and greed.
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:44:39
No, I think greed is a big factor.  That's a market force.  You can't ignore it.  Greed is always present.  Especially with the big rallies.  And you have to know not all Bitcoins are being traded.  Actually a very small amount of bitcoins are being traded.  Those bitcoins are determining the price.
What I'm saying is that there's low liquidity.
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:21:00
You can't say anything about the current crash yet.

What I actually meant was that its impossible to have this service and you owning the bitcoin.  Because when transfer it to someone they'd actually need to transfer actual bitcoin.  Okay not impossible but it would increase overhead costs.

Now that I think of it having 8 blocks in a row is not the only constraint.  We could think of it in term of how many hashes need to be done.  Not only did they have 8 in a row but they were also very close together.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:16:37
Thank you for the explanation, I was getting very confused with all the numbers.  What about placing orders?
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:17:33
But, if everyone uses Bitcoin the price will rise a lot!  Do you think people will willingly keep doing that?  Maybe other currencies are needed.  Because Bitcoin is not just a currency, it is like a stock and when new people want to buy in the early adopters profit.  this is different from a currency.

@_date: 2013-11-18 21:51:08
What I meant is that of course this would be great for the Bitcoin economy.  But, from steam's point of view the extra revenue that would be generated may be negligible.  For example, humble bundle started accepting bitcoins for there charity bundles.  That's great.  But, as someone else pointed out if you look closely, Bitcoin doesn't actually have a big percentage in there revenue.  well, this might have changed now with Bitcoin being worth more.  And letstalkbitcoin.com also donated a top 10 donation.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:11:41
That's great.

Oh yeah, current balance is only 0.36 BTC.

While Bitcoin may be a better store of value than gold I don't think you should really consider it a store of value.  I don't think you should store all  your value in Bitcoin.  That's not a good idea.

Yeah, you gain value when you downsize your house.  But, that's almost it for your primary residence.

You mean you'll get 0 confirmations in a really fast time?  Just because you see the transaction doesn't mean a "confirmation".  Confirmations are defined as when a Bitcoin block is when the blockchain has your transaction in a mined block.

What's wrong with flipping to a new coin?  By using Bitcoins you're actually supporting Bitcoin early adopters.  maybe people don't want to do that?
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:42:33
how about bit cent?
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:07:15
One thing you didn't mention is transaction fees.  With Litecoin more transactions are allowed.  Also, as a dev said Bitcoin was not maid for micro-transactions.  With litecoin transaction fees should be lower.  This is something that makes it Silver to Gold.

Bitcoin users are mainly tech savvy.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:28:34
The thing is Bitcoin doesn't need news to raise the price.  A raise in price can cause a rise in price.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:12:57
Obviously this is just some market manipulation.  They're pumping up the Bitcoin price so that they can liquidize there position.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:47:14
Actually these crashes are mainly caused by bots.  Lots of them probably implement EMA crossovers and then they do a market order at the crossover.  This causes a huge drop in price.  It's actually really bad for stability for so many people to be using the same settings.  Crashes could be caused like that time when someone added an extra zero to shares they wanted to sell.  The stock market crashed a lot as lots of auto sells got triggered.  More it fell more auto sells got triggered.  Yeah these flash crashes also empty out the people trading on margin.

Actually, this TV analogy is used a lot but that doesn't mean its right.  People will still want to buy TV's.  Also, what you're saying is that saving is encouraged.  This would be great for the USD.

There would also be a big drop, in anticipation of the drop.

Usually you don't need to do this if you have upnp enabled.  But, I need to do this because I'm actually behind to routers.  The one from the internet company which connects to the wifi thing.  So if I forward 8333 to my router everything is fine.  I think upnp is also better because if you're not running the bitcoin client then the port won't be open.
