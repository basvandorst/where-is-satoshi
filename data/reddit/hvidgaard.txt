No matter how things are done, there must be a secret. If an adversary gets hold of the secret (key), it's game over, the security failed. There is no way around this, so we might as well design the system to operate with this constraint.
If a special vault address is implemented, the secret recovery key to cancel pending transactions, must be secured and be offline, otherwise the security is one exploit away from being circumvented.

With SegWit the blocksizes is effectively increased, and the fee for a SegWit transaction should be cheaper that the same transaction without using SegWit. I have not verified the claim yet, so I'm only relaying the intention and implementation.

Retailers can still argue their case if you try to undo a transaction. That is impossible with bitcoin as it stands now.

Most people consider 6 conformations as valid, so if you can reject the last 6 blocks, you can create double spends and generally lower confidence in the network.
This is a statistical attack so anything less than 100% is not guaranteed to succeed.
@_date: 2015-06-02 10:13:36
51% attack is simply a term for producing 6 blocks in a row privately so you can undo transactions. You do not need 51% of the hashpower to succeed, it just takes longer to succeed if you have less.

I have not followed the arguments of either side, too much noise. But I think of this on a far more conceptual level. Do we want the blockchain to be the truth and history for all transactions, or do we just want it to be the truth for how much money a certain key control?
If we want history we have no  choice but to increase the blocksize - the information needs to be there.
If we just want it to keep count, then something like lightning network may be the answer.
Personally, I don't see the need to keep the history or make each and every transaction visible, so I support that side. That said, there is nothing that prevents us from using larger blocks today - so I want that to buy time and find the right solution.
@_date: 2015-06-02 12:28:23
There is no such thing as "almost surely guaranteed" in statistics.
If we have unbound time, even 0.01% hashing power will produce 6 block in a row at some point.

In the 50ies the man was still the sole income in many families, and he very much had the final say on how they were spend. Poor example.

Now to avoid justifying each purchase, its normal to agree on an average amount both can spend - this is the limit it sounds like op has crossed.

I'm just nitpicking, but you cannot prove that you wrote anything. You can prove that you knew a sha512 hash of the text. It's unlikely, but possible that someone find an attack against your hash of choice in the next 10 years that render your argument invalid.
You could take the hash of the text with several competing hashing algorithms and store them all. That is very unlikely that they all will be broken in the next 10years.

For a start it can switch once the pool it's connected to find more than x % of all blocks over the last y hours. Unless the pool distribute different addresses to different workers, it's trivially easy to see that your pool has found a block once it's in the blockchain.

You completely ignored the benefits of large mining pools.
There is no way to prevent any single one entity to become more than half of the network. None, doesn't exist - academia have tried to find a way for decades, it is not happening. Bitcoin is decentralized, majority will be right. Preventing pooled mining is allowing private investors to control the majority of the network - and unless something revolutionary happens, push out all small miners (who wants to mine for 3 life times to find a block?). How is that any better?
Andrew Millers proposed solution wouldn't work to stop hosted mining. Companies that sell hosted mining would simple switch to letting their clients dictate the pool, thus preventing cheating and give full disclosure of the work done. Back to status quo.
/Edit: and it wouldn't prevent pooled mining anyway - miners gain nothing from cheating because they cannot spend the coins anyway, and if they alter the address they will not get any reward from the pool.

Mallability is not a problem for the protocol. Both the original and the changed transaction have the exact same effect, the same coins are transfered from the same addresses to the same address.
The problem is that it changes the hash of the transactions and some people use this hash as a unique identifier of the transaction, which is stupid since it's been known for almost 3 years that it's mallable.

I think you guys would benefit tremendously from researching existing p2p protocols, their strengths and weaknesses. What you have described isn't much different from what we already know, but existing protocols handle grading of nodes more elegantly.
You still have to come up with a scheme where providing bandwidth result in currency and some form of proof that you cannot realistically circumvent the system, like the 51% proof and 6 confirmations with bitcoin. This is the hard part, and unless you or someone else come up with it, you're probably not going to succeed.

You either do not want my answer to make sense, or you do not understand what I'm saying. Most nodes use the same addresses for the work they do. Using that address is a hard indicator of the hashrate, because over time it you can directly calculate how much hashrate is needed, on average, to find that many blocks. But hashrate is irrelevant in my argument anyway. 
Lets take an example. If the (public) address you're currently mining for finds more than 40 blocks out of the last 100, you know that the pool has ~40% of the network hashrate +/- some variance.
The only way to combat this is by giving out several addresses from the same pool. Note that I'm not saying that there is mining software that can do this, but it's pretty simple to make and most accomplished programmers could make it working in less than a day.

Maybe bitcoin isnt for you, like coffee isn't for everyone. But it doesn't change the fact that it has some benefits.
The Zimbabwean dollar was just an example of what happens to a currency if the govnerment keeps printing money. I certainly wasn't comparing it to BTC. All major currencies operate with inflation, so while it may not happen right here right now, it still loses ~2% of it's value every year. This is also why there is no point in setting large sums of money aside, you HAVE to invest them if you want the real value to remain constant. While there is some different problems with deflation, it's one of the major tangible differences to fiat.


If the USD weakens all currencies in the world weaken, including USD. It doesn't matter what currency we use, it happens because people from the USA are spending less, thus decreasing demand and actually make things cheaper for everybody. However if everyone are using BTC it will just create a downward pressure, and create an oppotunity for other people in other countries to set aside some BTC and nullify the downward pressure. It will in essence bring more stability if everyone was using the same currency, doesn't have to be BTC. Note that people already see the benefit in this: All states in the US use the same currency, most countries in EU use Euro or have locked their local currency to the Euro.
But imagine a smaller country, which for one reason or the other, have rapidly declining fiat. Some extreme examples mean that you get paid daily and have to hurry and buy your necessities sooner rather than later because a week can mean it just lost 1-2% of it's value (I believe this has happened in Germany once). Now people will be spending less, but the value of BTC will be kept in check all other that use it, and that extreme inflation simply cannot happen because you cannot just decide to print more money.
That said, bitcoin, as it stands now, is not a stable medium for savings. Some believe that it will shoot up, other that it will die. Personally I have traded bitcoin for some nice profits, and if (and this is the important point) bitcoin manage to increase the actual market cap of real transactions to a sufficiently large value, the price of BTC would stabilize.
@_date: 2014-12-03 07:36:26
USD, Euro, and any other currency is backed and controled by a state. This has some positive and some negative aspect to it, but you have to trust the entity issuing the money to keep it controlled. There is plenty of [examples]( of what happens when they just issue more money because they need them.
BTC on the other hand is controlled by the majority of the computational power, which is distributed all over the world. One of the main benefits of this, is that you can, for a few cents send any kind of money to anyone anywhere in the world within the hour, no questions asked. Wire transfer is far more expensive and takes up to several bank days, and are sometimes held back for investigation if you send too much. Another major benefit is if a countrys economy weakens, what you're holding in BTC will not lose value because other contries are still standing strong keeping the price in check - that means your savings in BTC haven't lost any value (note this is ignoring price variance, which there has been plenty in the history of Bitcoin).

Once the bank commit a wire transfer, it's legally binding and they cannot undo it - the recieving part has cryptographic evidence (private key signature on the transfer, not at all unlike Bitcoin do it) that it happened and it's impossible to fake this unless you know the sending parts private key. The other part has to transfer it back, be it by own free will, or by court order and seized assets.

Pools are not a problem, and honestly I believe that the major pools have all the reason (read lots of bitcoin in fees) to stay honest. If they did deceive their users they end up with no income, and the bitcoins they hold might be worth less.
What those big pools do, that greatly benefit bitcoin, are precisely being so big that it's a lot harder for private entities to do the same.
The main problem here, is the ability for any one entity to become very large. And in times like this I see suggestions every day on how to prevent it, and at least once a week someone ask for input on their proposal to do something about it. The problem is however fundamental, and to this day no one have solved it in any context that involves an unstructured distributed network (to my knowledge, I do not spend my day in that part of academic anymore). This includes decades of academic efforts in the field.

I don't quite follow. Any settlement network needs something of value to settle. That automatically becomes the currency of the settlement network, and nothing prevents a merchant to accept payments on the settlement network. In essence, anything that is used as a currency is part of some settlement network, even if we're trading grain and sheep, and the network might only exist between us. And anything that is part of a settlement network is a currency.
As it is technically clear that the Bitcoin network is unable to scale in its current form does not mean it isn't a currency, it just isn't used the way you want a currency to be - i.e. by your definition East Caribbean Dollars is not a currency because you cannot use them widely, and USD is both a settlement layer (because other currencies is locked to USD) and a currency.

If empty blocks decrease propagation delays, guess what careless miners will do to decrease their orphan block rate...
@_date: 2016-01-28 08:22:00


The point is that until it is needed, we should hold it off. Otherwise we run the risk of 2 hardforks when 1 would have been enough. Is it really that hard to understand and accept?


If/when the network grows to that size with more peoples living depending on it, I'm sure it's actually easier to coordinate because the "powerusers" would keep an eye on any announcements, and be willing to upgrade because it is in their interest.


Instead of claiming we need it, show me some data about it, because I haven't seen the blocks filling up other than with spam. Just look at the size of the last years worth of blocks, they're only slightly above half full.


I never said the protocol should do it, but I stand by the fact that the standard client should have a default way to filter spam that miners can copy.


As I have said, we don't need the increase right now, so it is quite hotheaded to implement a non permanent solution. When we need something urgently, it's probably the best bandaid we have. That said, even 1MB is pushing it with the poor connection to China. The more we increase the blocksize, the more orphaned blocks will be seen and we risk network segmentation where miners in China unwillingly do selfish mining.


I have justified my view, but if "techincal" means I have to use math and code, then no, I haven't been technical.
@_date: 2016-01-29 08:00:01
It's okay, a little more orphaned blocks, but nothing to worry about. But it highlights the problem that larger blocks are not the solution to scaling, so we should only do it if we have to, simply to avoid a hardfork if possible.
Personally, I think we should focus on improving block propagation. Instead of relaying the entire block, just relay enough information to rebuild the block from the transactions most nodes already have in the mempool. This can be done on the order of 32-64 bytes for each transaction, and VISA level transaction volume would require 20-40 MB on average for propagation if we do this - the blocks will be significantly larger.
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:36:11
Except for the massive botnets that would be the backbone of bitcoin. I still think it is better than the current ASIC backed network however.
@_date: 2016-01-19 11:12:47
There is a lot of hashing power in China, and a lot in the rest of the world. Most of the rest of the world is well connected and block propagation is not a problem, however, the connection to China is less than good, and 40-50kb/s is to be expected. This means that for a block to travel to and from China it takes 20 seconds. This is okay, but if you increase the block to 10mb we're it'll take 200 seconds. This is bad, because it'll lead to a lot of orphaned blocks, and it could end in a scenario similar to selfish mining.
In short, the currently the network is divided in 2, only connected by a tiny strings. Increasing the blocksize unreasonably effectively leads to separate networks, where the side with the most hashing power wins. Keeping the blocksize reasonably low prevents this.
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:09:23
It isn't with Bitcoin Classic, but it illustrate why increasing the blocksize is not a scalable solution, and why the Core devs want to find a different solution.
As far as I've read, the Core team agree that an increase to 2mb is safe, but not needed right now. If and when it becomes an issue they can increase the blocksize.
@_date: 2016-01-27 09:40:12
I do understand your frustrations, but I think Bitcoin is moving towards being a ledger network, rather than everyday payment network. For any kind of scaling this is probably a good idea, but we need to get the "everyday payment network" figured out sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2016-03-07 12:59:53
And by your definitions coffee mugs are a currency because some people use them as a medium of exchange in the office.
You're mixing Bitcoin the network and Bitcoin the currency. Bitcoin the network is a backing network, because Bitcoin the currency is purely digital, it needs a backing network which happens to be a settlement network. Bitcoin the currency is a medium of exchange currently, and when scaling issues have been solved, can be widely used.
Even if the solution is LN, they still use Bitcoin the currency, with Bitcoin the network it ultimately decide who is in control of bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-01-27 09:34:30


Right now it would be a hardfork, for the sake of doing a hardfork. As long as we can avoid it, we should. We don't *need* larger blocks now, or for the foreseeable future (we do however need to filter out spam txs), and when/if bitcoin continues to increase in volume 2MB would not be enough anyway, and we have to do yet another hardfork.
So, from the technical stand point, they're seeking to solve the root of the problem, and then they will increase the block size when it is needed.

Bigger blocks is a bandaid solution if the endgame is many transactions. Multiple layers of blockchains is the only way to realistically capture hundreds of millions of transactions every day, with the hardware and networking we have today. I have zero reason to know about transactions in Asia or America so why put it all in the same blockchain? Crosschain atomic swaps would mean that we can use multiple blockchain without going through exchanges. LN enables exactly that, and we have Litecoin already implementing it, so using their testnet against bitcoins testnet to implement it is possible today.

Secure the accounts with 2/3 multi keys, hand the members of the family 1 key to their respective accounts, 1 key your store with trusted 3rd party, e.g. a lawyer or bank vault, and 1 key you keep for yourself. Upon your dead the 3rd party will release the keys, or you can do it yourself on your dead bed.

If maximum compatibility is the goal, then SegWit is clearly the better solution. Existing nodes and miners will continue to work. It is probably not enough on its own long term, but it could be done today without too much interuption.

I know that I'd much rather have the Core developers build 2mb blocks in the Core client, than relying on whatever wannabe is trying to create a new default bitcoin implementation.

You're not doubling supply, since it will be two different coins.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:56:58
Nothing happens on the chain unless the majority of the miners agree. And fiat does not flow in or out unless the exchanges agree with the miners.
So. No matter what users think and signal, we need to convince the miners. And no matter what the miners does, they need to convince the exchanges. This is a fundamental princip of how it works.
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:29:00
The miners don't have to run the UASF, they just have to activate SegWit. I do believe this is happening unless some powerful people have a different agenda than the one they have publicly stated.
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:42:25
Some people would say it's because SegWit looks like it will become a reality, the adversaries spamming the network have stopped.
Personally, I just think it's because people delay transactions until they know how it pans out in the first few weeks of August.
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:47:59
SegWit enables off-chain scaling, which is the only way it'll ever scalin volume to huge volumes. It also enables bigger blocks without the exploding the verification time, for actual on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:33:47
I forgot an important word, decentralized. What decentralized ledger could handle micro transaction of the Western world today? If we project Bitcoin today, to match VISA volumes, blocks would be unfeasible large.
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:14:22
I hope that the official tools from Ledger would be able to detect counterfeits. But if the adversary controls your PC and switch your hw wallet with a counterfeit, there is little you can do.
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:56:59
The NY agreement does not state when or if SegWit will activate at all. But it is raising the block to 2mb now, so given how things have went down before, I only see the big block side getting what they want.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:31:56
What altcoin have transactions smaller than 200bytes?
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:49:19
Get a computer or phone you trust. Use one of the widely recommended wallets like mycelium or electrum that support bip-32/39/44 wallets. Save the seed words in a safe place and make sure that you can restore your wallet on a different device (test this with a very small amount of BTC in it). Then you control your keys and have a backup if the device dies.
@_date: 2013-07-31 12:50:14
I know of it's existences, but it is highly experimental, and I would not trust it any "significant" amount of money.
To have real light-nodes we need a few changes to the bitcoin protocol itself, and unless it becomes part of the official specification, I don't think it will gain traction.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:23:15
It's not only the miners that decide. Exchanges are still the entry and exit point for the vast majority of Bitcoin usage. If the majority of exchanges don't want a fork, miners would be foolish to do it anyway, as they risk that all mined coins are worthless when they cannot convert them to fiat.
@_date: 2013-07-04 06:33:32
It will never happen. ASICs are out in the wild, they cannot do anything but the SHA PoW calculation. So unless an altcoin comes along and is more profitable than bitcoin (doubtful), the diff is not going down in any way.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:54:51
My point is that increasing the block size is simple symptom treatment. It does not solve the underlying issue, nor will it work as the network scale. The core devs have proposed a damn good solution to the scaling issue, but some stubborn miners refuse it, presumably because it fix asic boost.
@_date: 2013-08-05 20:49:18
Yes, but if you where to create a system that does not require to change the bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2013-05-23 19:24:51
You can connect to the network and read the blockchain, but just keep track of your own keys, no need to keep the blockchain.

Banks will never be overthrown. People want a place to safely store assets, borrow money for a house/car/whatever, manage credit/debit cards, and offer protection from scams - banks can do all that and more. It doesn't matter if the medium is $ or btc.
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:52:48
It's a 10kb transaction, where a normal transaction is 200-300 bytes. Of course it will be more expensive when the space is at a premium. In this case it will be 1% of the space in a single block, or equivalent to 30-40 normal transactions.
The fee is still higher than it should be, but it is not exorbitant when you get a global secure distributed and fast transaction.
@_date: 2013-05-20 18:34:23
The main obstacle will be making it in a decentralised fashion (centralised is an already solved problem), where the network also handle the verification and payment. Very interesting problem actually. If you can limit the "work units" to be easily verified, the only real problem is distributed reward. You can split a key pair generation to several nodes without any single node knowing the private key. Extending such that address generation and making the transaction are also distributed seems doable, but extensive crypto experience is needed. 
@_date: 2013-06-28 09:00:45
Wrong, I would have lost money by not selling. If I had 10 btc when they where at 250$ I had 2500$ assuming I sold. After the crash I had 1000$, that is a loss in terms of fiat, but also in btc when you account for the fact that the value of goods are tied to fiat and not btc.
I'm not saying people should day trade, because I really don't advice anyone to do it. Few people can do it successfully, and for the average person, just holding on is better as pointed out by the infographic.
@_date: 2017-06-02 20:59:21
I am thinking for myself, which is why I don't buy into "alts can do it, Bitcoin must be wrong" bullshit. Altcoins don't have a fraction of the volume, so of course they are faster and cheaper, and have a more agile development. But guess what happens if they get the same volume as Bitcoin? They face the exact same issues, or worse, they hit a ceiling because blocks become too big to reasonable propagate in the network.
@_date: 2013-07-31 12:52:19
You can create a similar concept with the current protocol, but it still misses some bits. Nothing major, but changes are needed if we are going to have an official "light" mode.
Re. the comparison, only the future can tell. If the bitcoin team focus on the right tasks, I don't see any other coin replacing it, merely coexisting.
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:20:59
You cannot have every micro transaction in a globally distributed secure public ledger. That simply doesn't scale. Bitcoin is already very light pr transaction, so we need a different scaling mechanism, e.g. LN.
@_date: 2013-06-19 11:40:19
Except for the fact that bitcoin ASICs are specialized to the point where they cannot do anything else unless someone tailor an algorithm to the hardware. For starters they do a double SHA calculation, secondly they will only return ever return hashes starting with '0000'.
@_date: 2013-05-02 06:11:28
Currently cpu mining is yielding less than it cost for all coins. That leaves GPUs, and there isn't many datacenters with a load og high end GPUs, and even if they did the cooling cost alone would drive the cost significantly up.
@_date: 2013-05-28 21:52:00
The same is true for bitcoin with the only difference being a constant factor due to the slower block time. So any length that provides a reasonable security against a malicious miner, is reasonable against networks with a faster block time like litecoin. This is true because we aim for exponentially exploded difficulty, and as such not even a factor of 100 (6 sec block time) will make a difference to the feasibility of the attack.
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:29:23
I have heard the argument many times, but I haven't seen any actual math behind it. The proof of 51% attacks only takes the block-time into consideration when estimating how long on average a successful 51% attack would take.
@_date: 2013-07-31 13:24:28
[The wiki]( is a good start.
And more importantly the following quote


That said, the protocol lack some features wrt. double spend detection, and (in my opinion) a way to elect trusted nodes.  Without trusted nodes and verification of the communications to them, a network isolation attack is much easier to pull off against a client-only node, than compared to a full node.
@_date: 2013-07-07 19:31:59
Sigh... There are far more imminent problems at hand. Useability for starters, without that, it will never be a problem with a bloated block chain. Secondly, so far the Moores Law of harddrive capacity have far exceeded the "problem" of the block size. Not to mention the unstructured network, that certainly doesn't scale well - that is an already solved problem, but there is absolutely no reason to spend time changing it because the current model works just fine.
So the developers, with limited resources focus on the things that makes sense, and leave interesting problems, like the block chain scalability alone until they have to solve it - at which point it's highly likely that a phd thesis or even master thesis have solve it for them.
@_date: 2013-05-20 11:50:30
You should choose, either GPU friendly calculations, or CPU only. They require different implementation, and doing both is a classic mistake of too much work for the initial product.
In any case, do you want this to be somehow integrated with bitcoin, or do you just want to leverage bitcoins as payment?
@_date: 2013-08-05 08:57:35
An open-source trustless system is probably more work than zero-coin would be. But first we still need to reach critical adoption mass.
@_date: 2013-07-07 18:36:57
It probably wouldn't be able to handle an entire countrys economy, but it isn't difficult to extent the current solution to handle the volume, buying enough time for a real fix to the scalability issues.
@_date: 2013-09-05 08:00:37
You stop dealing in whole bitcoins, but in micro bitcoins, satoshis or another unit that fit the market.
@_date: 2013-08-05 11:17:30
I don't think the second system for coin mixing is the right way to go, but it depends on how much need there is. If the demand is great enough for a service to exist, and for enough volume to mix coins well - arguably there is a need for zero-coin in the main bitcoin protocol.
What I meant with critical adoption mass, was the bitcoin itself. It needs to be mainstream accepted, before we spend too many resources on other things. Imagine if you could pay rent and utilities with bitcoin - at that point all transactional data is public (opposed to now, where only banks and state have access to it), and zero-coin makes perfect sense.
@_date: 2013-05-21 06:10:50
That is why work needs to be verifiable, like the PoW scheme for bitcoin is. If you need central trusted nodes, you might as well just run it on a controlled cluster.
Alternatively, you can make the work depend on a nodes public key, but then you have to make sure that malicious key generation is not a problem. If a nodes result is worthless to other nodes because they have different public keys, you have good protection against "share cheating".
@_date: 2013-06-28 06:11:36
It's all well and good that it's going "up", but in the financial sense you still lost money because you didn't sell at the peak and bought back when it crashed.
That said, I don't recommend anyone to hold btc, use them instead - it will help the currency gain ground.
@_date: 2013-07-31 10:21:36
From my quick glance, we're talking about 160 times larger. That's too much, and switching to a different crypto scheme that cannot be broken with quantum computers is a far better idea (that will render current mining hardware useless /edit this is not true as pointed out below by vuce).
@_date: 2013-07-07 19:13:46
There is not, and have not been, a need to do it yet. It is a hard problem, that requires some serious creativity to solve, but for now the block chain isn't having a bloating problem.
@_date: 2013-07-31 11:28:56
I believe that it is inevitable that we see a "light-node" concept, that does not require the full knowledge of the block-chain.
It may or may not be a problem, but focus should be on making the most resistant system. If that can only be done with Lamport signatures, then so be it. The current size of unspend coins is ~100MiB according to the bitcoin wiki, so even ballooning that with Lamport signatures, will be a small amount by todays standard. But if we can get by with the same or only a factor 4-5 more than RSA, then it is clearly the better choice.
@_date: 2013-07-31 11:43:50
The current protocol requires the entire blockchain to work, but in reality only the addresses with unspend coins contain data, and the adjustments to make it prune addresses with 0 coins is not that difficult. But by pruning addresses with 0 coins, you erase history, so full-nodes are still needed, and they will see a greater amount of request for data than light-nodes would. It is figure out a good 2 layer network that is the hard part.
@_date: 2013-07-31 11:21:47
True, forgot that little, but very important point about mining.
My point still stands though. We have 3 classes of crypto systems that are quantum-resistant, and might even turn out to be quantum-secure. 
You are right that NTRU is under patent, and probably will not be used (btw, the keysize 4024 bits give better security than RSA with 4096 bit key, but for anything less, RSA wins the keysize : security ratio - [source]( so if the patent issues can be worked out, it is a good candidate.
