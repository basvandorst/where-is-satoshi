who is doing hedge holds bitcoin, and now selling.
You dont know in % of that short position is hedge operations. We dont have a couter part for that yet.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:27:38
its true
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:33:26
or do this:
21 Miliions Bitcoin x 1000, and the price 16950,00 / 1000
Resulting 21Billions Bitcoins at US 16,95
and anyone need do extra math. 
Naming the scale (bits/satoshis) is just more work.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:24:46
So, miners can sell and everyone bying crazy. No wonder that bitcoin price is so high.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:25:59
lightning network shoud star over there.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:25:13
they can not hold the product when see tha payment on system, its better than accept theis awful money.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:17:27
but now, the price is so high, probaly that growth will not happen again.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:54:30
where the hodlers when need, right?
someone hold that 1000 btc, only costs 17million dollars
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:17:24
alot people won alot a money on 2008, there a movie about.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:48:25
i like that, but i dont have bitcoin.
doent seem a scam, its just a guy beting on market growth, these 7 days are crucial because launch of futures trades.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:15:34
Buy with better price, dollars ou bitcoin.
You need calculated how much time you need to payback. Do a "Internal rate of return", using eletric bill as negative payments + your BTC minered , and a free risk rate.
im sure you found one reary on internet
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:57:03
dont sell, do a hedge on wall street, at least you protect you value until you can sell
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:46:29
cool, mr robot will cause a crash, aushuahs
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:02:59
sure, a country build a power plant to provide energy until 2050 but sure bitcoin can overload that in some years.
Bitcoin IS basically costs of energy + hardware
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:34:49
cryptocompare is showing a payback only 51days (more when you add energy cost), its super fast
but keep in mind that number is real only if mining difficult and price remaining the same
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:39:31
because he "sold" bitcoins to invest, but bitcoin growth too much, that much will not happen again, not before some "crash"/"corretion" on price, today the price hits 14k because expectation on that institutional money from wallstreet, but that easyly can do opposite if the reality dont get close.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:55:40
HE DID 9,4M U$ PROFIT IN THAT DAYTRADE
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:28:50
why not just pay btc to full nodes? someone can tell?
that problem is solve overnight, i garanteed
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:00:56
no, alreary happen to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:26:48
Yes, and i believe the price is gonna take a big hit down (call a correction) on launch, and growth again with lower volatility.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:59:59
nice future trade, who needs cme and nasdaq
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:55:05
not wrong in two cases, 29$ &gt; 2,23$ = -92%, 1071$ &gt; 239$ -77%.
imo, same scenario in this year
@_date: 2019-01-25 00:21:51
or a third language.
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:15:51
Almost meaningles. Ppl on Venezulea are running away from their own fiat money.  
ppl search better asset when their money dont have any value, like gold, or crypto.  
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:39:21
Hyperinflation is more a effect of expansion of Monetary Base. Real cause is way deeper  
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:20:15
Venezuela in last years?
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:31:06
Adding/cuts zeros is just for zero cost, but printing money is other thing. To make money just need grant credit to banks, there is a multiplier effect
@_date: 2019-01-24 02:05:55
Brazil had hyperinflation between 1990\~1993, there is alot to be learn.  
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:29:26
Correctly, by law they need keep only a small %, in USA i guess 10%
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:22:10
This made my eyes bleeded.
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:31:00
whey less, USA is about 10%
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:48:35
Only price a found is BRL 306k, its about a 23bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:19:37
over here the money is worthless too (Brazil)
@_date: 2019-01-24 01:56:09
This is other thing, but make sense when there is banks with 0% fractional reverves.  
@_date: 2019-01-24 02:04:09
its just a failed way to  stabilize the value of their money.
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:25:51
"Printing Money" is 99% eletronic. Just need a pen do it.but in cases of hyperinflation, they needed to printing machines  24/7 for the 1%.
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:59:01
This is how money is made in a modern economy, even on Venezuela where is called Socialist.watch?v=JG5c8nhR3LETo do so, just need drop the obrigatory rate called Required Reserve.Paper money is a small % of a Monetary Base of the economic, Even in a hyperinflation.  
Edit: 8% of Monetary Base is paper money, and dropping.This happen because the total increase in a bigger rate. Source:[
