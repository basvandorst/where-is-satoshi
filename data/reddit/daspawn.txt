Satoshi never intended a size limit and said it was temporary, keeping the limit is specifically designed to make bitcoin fail or only benefit centralized "alternatives"

I use Linux for everything :)  For the server I am using a base Ubuntu 12 minimal install (it is running as a virtual machine) and I compiled both bitcoind and electrum server from git sources.  The electrum server used to require a patch in core for transaction indexes, but no longer).  Recently I just downloaded bitcoind core for update as it contains the needed transaction index code now
the electrum server howto is a really good guide: 
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:28:17
I imagine that most end users will not run the full client in the future with or without larger blocks as they have no real need or incentive to other than just to support the network (like myself).  Most end users will end up in some kind of thin client (web wallet, electrum, trezor) as it is much easier to maintain and setup for the average end user.
With the cost of space ever decreasing, it will not be too difficult to support the blockchain into the future.  I have had to deal with potential scaling issues in client systems and have never ran into a wall.  With the cost of hardware/storage ever decreasing, I suspect we will have absolutely no problem with bitcoin scaling, even with much larger blocks.
There is also the potential of much larger businesses (ie. banks) that have the resources to run the full nodes, and it would just be good business practice to run a full node as the safety and security of the entire network depends on it, including the large business utilizing the blockchain to keep that data and the network secure and running well into the future.  Also if a large company is making a profit on blockchain related services, it would just be good business to invest in the network via a full node.
There are other potential options into the future like spent transaction pruning, but even that has potential issues where most users run a pruning node.
I go by what Satoshi said, the limit was temporary and should be removed in the future, so we should plan for that and avoid hard forks at all costs

people CHOOSE to point their hashing power to them, they can change to anyone they like in a heartbeat.  Everyone gets the greatest bang for their buck by being in a mining pool, what pool that is is entirely their choice.
THAT is decentralization, where people can JOIN TOGETHER for a common goal while still keeping everything decentralized.

no they are not, this is the most boogie-man statement I have ever heard.  The world will not end and one of the forks will continue, no matter what.  Even if it was the most contentious hard fork ever, there would still be a single chain, the chain EVERYONE chooses to work with that continues.  Are you really trying to tell me that bitcoin can not survive this simple eventually that is guaranteed to happen again in the future?
I have seen a hard fork already, you know what happened?  it was fixed before anyone even really noticed.
Why does everyone fear progress?  Restricting progress out of fear creates centralization and a point of failure, not a hard fork

no, it requires/made for the electrum client for communications/use.  If you are looking for api for bitcoin that can be easily adapted for the web, have a look at

Whichever fork has the most consensus will happen, if many move to XT showing their support for larger blocks, it would be better for core to implement how the network is currently running rather than try to create another fork.
Bottom line is we want to avoid hard forks, and BIP-8MB gives us not only small increase now, but plans out block size increases into the future without forks, where as BIP-100 moves away from Satoshi's original implementation of no block limits and makes a tiny one to 2MB with the goal of "soft forks" later, convoluting the foundation of bitcoin and creating much more uncertainty than with BIP-8MB
@_date: 2015-06-23 15:13:06
Electrum is a light client as it does not download the blockchain, and relies on a special server that relays transactions and confirms balances.  The electrum server relies on bitcoin core to do all this.
Anyone can run an electrum server, and the client can pick one at random.  There is some privacy implications as the sever can see client transactions, but can not alter.  I do not maintain logs just to mitigate this potential issue.  I would close my business and shut down before I allowed anyone's privacy to be violated. 
for anyone looking to run a locally stored wallet/client I usually recommend this, it is quick to setup, and immediately available to use (no need to download the entire blockchain)

The post said someone there dislikes bitcoin, not me.  I think Google is great actually.  I was elaborating on Google's current position on bitcoin is strange at best, but that could be because they are trying to focus on Google wallet, or they have bigger plans they have not announced yet
or more likely bitcoin is a blip on their radar and they care less at the moment and do not want to invest any time or energy yet
Nobody knows what is really going on, but it does not change the fact that Google is an impressive aggregator/indexer with great free stuff for people to use.  They are expanding into more service areas now which is also great.
crypto-currency can potentially touch everyone's lives around the world, every fauset of peoples lives, even if they have never heard of Google, which was my point.

I have been a developer for over 10 years and you know what works?  simplicity.
The more complicated you make a system, the more likely it will break/be broken later.  
Why are we considering making bitcoin more complicated and in turn more unreliable and unstable when we can change one number in the existing code and be done with this right now?  
there are many more things to worry about and be worked on with bitcoin, we are all just completely wasting everyones time, and risking all of bitcoins progress and future in the process
New features are great, they should be tried and tested outside the production network
You do not stick a crowbar in a running engine to make it run better, you use a screw driver to adjust the idle
@_date: 2015-06-03 04:39:54
The roads only connected and enhanced our economy, it did not create it or build all the numerous persons and business that use the roads every day
crypto-currency is not only financial connections but property, assets, and so much more, and they all use the roads Google is building, and they are awesome for doing that
@_date: 2015-06-23 16:57:06
In terms of storage/bandwidth, I have multiple gigabit backbones, and have access/expertise to build storage into whatever is needed. (recently built a 96TB storage server for ~10K for a customer, and worked with numerous distributed cluster data systems in the past). 
I am currently waiting for the dust to settle in the block size debate, so running at defaults still (I did not realize the default was not 1M until recently).  I am going to bump it to 1M once the electrum server finishes indexing.
I normally wait a month or so before updating to the latest versions of core/electrum server, but am leaning towards Gavin's BIP-8M as it is a good solution to solve current/soon/potential issues and hopefully prevent the need for hard forks in the immediate future 
TL;DR wherever bitcoin goes, I will be right there with it without issue or worry.

Technical view only, far from religious, and talking about greatest impact in history, ie 25+ years from now.  Market cap and exchange rate will follow market penetration, and the potential penetration of crypto-currencies into every inch of the world economy can be much greater than what Google alone could do (currently)
Or it could die tomorrow and nothing comes of it, either way awesome experiment
Simplest example is you would not need to involve Google to pay your rent.  It might involve using the road they provided to you, but not more than that

True, but this is why many full nodes are needed, if any have an issue it is not the end of the world
Bitcoin is not even close to replacing anything, I would consider as beta, stable enough to not have many issues, but small/correctable issues certainly pop up (like email being unavailable for 30 min not the end of the world, but as a email provider being down for 1 second people think it is the end of the world)

Absolutely not, it is the merchant is completely on the hook and looses has the funds taken back from them; chargebacks are a huge problem for merchants are they are the ones that loose, that is why it is their responsibility to confirm the card belongs to the presenter via the signature/id verification/etc

all web wallets are potentially vulnerable , blockchain.info is the most well known, so it is targeted.  This is no different than windows viruses vs mac vs linux, they all can be infected, but windows has the largest target area
web based wallets have advantages local wallets can not, ease of accessability, no need to worry about physical loss of the wallet, etc.  Most people do not understand how the internet works, so do not realize what actions can make them vulnerable , be it local or remotely hosted wallet
blockchain.info is getting a black eye for the problems between the screen and chair

I have an android phone, also use CWM, but in the end it is not the phone I do not trust, it is the portability and highly targeted malicious software potential (in the end nothing is 100% secure and stock rom or CWM can both be compromised).  I keep a minimal amount of coins accessible from the phone, and only use the blockchain wallet so nothing is really stored on the phone.  I also keep coins in multiple wallets and offline wallets so if one becomes compromised I do not loose everything.
Sorry for your loss, hopefully you discover the exact attack vector...

I work at a datacenter with multi-gigabit backbones and run a full node, but I can not do this for free forever, and if the network really takes off the system requirements will be way more than can do for free.  I also run an electrum server, I plan on keeping everything going, but donations may not cut it in the long run.  
TL;DR incentives to full note operators would be truly needed to keep the entire network safe, secure, and decentralized

This is great, but you could also add the ability to change your address by signing a message with your existing wallet

The more people running full nodes, the more secure the network is.  Having to store everyone elses data for free is a huge risk to the future of bitcoin.  Counterparty and/or Mastercoin need to realize this and use an already perfectly recommended usage of DHT
Also, utilizing SHT, there could be incentives built into an accompanying system that allows for payments/rewards for running a DHT node, plus much much more information could be stored that way

oh I never went there for bitcoin news either, I used to love the technology section as my industry is entirely technology oriented, but I occasionally visit now as the posts have gone way downhill.  This is not just bitcoin technology censoring that concerns me, any new technology could fall to the whims of the censoring, and it is an unacceptable way to moderate.  If people accept the position of moderation, along with the expectation of not being paid for it, turning to word censoring to do their work is piss poor and unacceptable, they should be ashamed, and they should enlist more people to moderate if they feel they are overloaded
bitcoin is just the beginning, all censorship starts with "good intentions"

so do not accept bitcoin as more credit card transactions helps the chargeback problem of your cc processing account?  that is not really a good argument for/against the non-chargeback nature of bitcoin, you are avoinding a potentially great payment system to help solve the broken one.
pretend that cc processing did not exist, everyone could pay with bitcoin, you had no worries of charge-backs, and the only transactions you receive are legitimate, as crooks/thieves are not going to send you a non-reversible transaction, so you do not risk loss of product from fraudulent transactions, loss of time spent processing/handling fraudulent transactions, easier accounting as no need to worries about unexpected losses due to fraud, and cheaper overhead in processing in general, how is that a red herring?

I just had a nightmare of a time with a software application that did not work properly after purchase. recovery software, demo lets you see waht is recoverable but does not let try.  Bought with CC, company had 30 day money back but no response.  CC company giving me grief asking for all kinds of info including a 3rd party stating the software did not work.  After days back and forth with wasted time and tons of letters the software company finally returned funds
TL;DR not all CC companies are quick to chargeback, and my first disappointment with USAA after being with them for years (my CC company).  As much as i like bitcoin, it would have been screwed here, and the only reason the company returned funds was pressure from their CC processor most likely

incorrect, mortgages are a fairly new creation, and were not needed to own property, and they only came into existence/popular/needed after of the great depression, which was caused by fractional reserve banking and banks basically gambling in the stock market with their depositors money
college loans also did not really exist until recently, a kid could work a part time summer job and afford to live and pay a year of tuition with the income they received.

almost, unfortunately it would provide eavesdroppers with your transaction information and could follow the very public chain of ownership/transactions
bitcoin being pseudo-anonymous, it would be best to have encryption, JIC (always err on the side of caution)
very awesome tech though, I suspect we could send bitcoin information in a radio/audio broadcast (without encryption though).  Could you imagine a broadcast "... if you wanna donate bla bla, open your app now", then bam, payment address received, no user interaction/entry of payment address

mods should be there to remove spam, not censor posts that does not fit within their world view.  Bitcoin is one of the most amazing technological innovations of our time, and yet is it censored entirely.  Was there spam in there about it?  yes.  Should it be censored entirely because of it?  absolutely not. 
Users should be the ones that decide what they want censored, nothing more.  moderators should only be there to remove posts as they pose a problem, and never completely censor any topic.
the technology section, which used to be great, has been the last place I visit anymore
this is not about subscribing or unsubscribing, this is about quality of content, which mods should also be extremely concerned about. Censoring the term bitcoin, which is unarguably an amazing technological innovation, is not moderation, it is suppression of something they do not like for no other reason that they do not like it, and they should be ashamed
What about the next technological innovation? Do we suppress every new technology or only the ones they do not like? What about all of the people that do subscript to the technology section in the expectation of getting technology related content, but in reality not getting it at all? Its the technology section now only about promoting current technology and suppressing new technology that might compete with it?
My point is this is a troubling tend that will only serve to harm the value and quality of all sub-reddits, not just the technology section

The name does not mean too much (at least right now), it would be great if everyone knew the name Bitcoin, but in the end it may not be bitcoin itself that survives the future, but another electronic currency that people have no problem using and understanding because of things that make use of alt-coins in interesting and useful ways.  This also gets people used to working with multiple digital currencies, whatever their use

inflation of a currency is completely different than inflation in an economy
economic inflation happens when too much money is printed and/or the purchasing power of a currency is greatly reduced, meaning the costs of goods get higher and higher in relation to the currency in your wallet, and unless your pay increases to keep pace with the inflation, the dollar that used to buy a gallon of gas now only buys a quarter of a gallon.  The effect is not even, and various goods and services raise in price at different amounts.  Bottom line you can buy less and less every day with the same amount of money you had yesterday.  This system severely discourages saving (adding insult to injury that interest on savings does not come close to the rate of inflation), and greatly encourages increasing debt to buy today.  This in no way benefits the consumer (and most do not realize this as they are able to have gratification today), and completely benefits the holders of debt.  The other issue is run-away inflation, the inevitable eventuality of all fiat currencies, destroying an economy and hurting everyone but those that are able to afford assets other than the local currency.  
currency inflation and deflation is a whole different animal.  Forget bitcoin for a second and assume we are dealing with dollars again.  You have a dollar that buys a gallon of gas today, but in 2 weeks that same dollar can buy 2 gallons.  Now you have to spend less to obtain what you needed last week, and you have more money available to either save or spend on other things (more to spend on what you want rather than what you only need).  If you save the money you will have more purchasing power over time, and be able to afford to purchase larger items without the need for credit.  This greatly encourages savings, while at the same time putting downward pressure on prices of goods.  This method greatly benefits the consumer as they have more purchasing power over time, but greatly harms creditors and debt holders
Both of these can be bad if they happen too fast, and being unpredictable (fiat, politics) is much worse, whereas being predictable (math) can have great advantages in the long run.  Some would argue that why would people spend money if holding on to it means they have more later, but people still need to eat, live, drive, etc, and many people are unwilling or incapable of saving.

People love simplicity and things they can relate to:
- bitcoin is essentially a transaction/bank ledger (the blockchain), like your checkbook that (almost)everyone has a copy of and anyone can update at any time (so coind never really move anywhere, all transactions are just an entry in the ledger)
- transactions are verified by miners about every 10 minutes to prevent double spends and ensure the validity of the ledger, they are rewarded with new coins at a fixed amounts over time that can not be changed without everyone agreeing to the change
- your wallet is just a couple of related addresses (private and public) that anyone can generate and use to perform transactions in the blockchain.  Multiple public addresses can relate to the same private address, meaning every transaction you perform can have a different address to send to
- all transactions must be initiated by the owner, nobody has access to your private wallet unless you give them access, meaning nobody can take coins from you, and all transactions are finial
of couse can go on with details but get the attention and interest within first minute or 2. If you start talking about exchange rates and what the price is doing/done before they are interested/informed about the tech, the most important part, you will loose people a lot of times (people do not understand how something they can not hold has value without understanding the tech that give it value

It is only about trust and security, trust in the provider (electrub/webwallet) the server/software is secure and unaltered and security of the bitcoin network itself by having more people that hold the blockchain in it's entirety.
As for electrum, worst possibility is your transaction is not transmitted to the network as you wallet is still encrypted and stored locally, webwallets bit trickier as wallet is encrypted and stored remotely, also have to trust connection to their site/code is not altered
They are all safe, but best solution is to not keep all your eggs in one basket.  webwallets small amounts easily accessable to you, electrum get you going now but mostly desktop uses, full client to help the network/store some coin, and paper/offline wallets for true savings/safety

so much FUD lately..  everyone needs to stop and think about what will truly happen if a pool decides to double spend with a 51% attack:
* the attack is limited only to current transaction processing, does nothing to past 
transactions, and a good example of what can happen on unexpected issues just look back at the version chain split
* there is no guarantee that a pool will be able to mine all successive block during a 51% attack, this would mean a chain split that will be noticed very quickly, and large processors can halt processing while investigated to minimize risk
* a pool would only be able to double spend their own coins, this would be incredibly simple to detect
* no other transactions are at risk
* no others wallets or coins are at any risk 
* the attack vector is limited to a pool, not a single miner.  This means that everyone currently mining in a pool can move to another pool and the malicious pool will fall from existence
* bitcoin clients detect/do not allow double spends, this means the only transactions at risk are those that allow 0 conformations, even a few confirmations would almost ensure a safe transaction, &gt; 10 conformations make it nearly impossible to be a double spend
is the possibility of a 51% attack real? yes.  Is it the end of bitcoin if it happens?  absolutely not.  All of the security of bitcoin remains intact, every transaction an hour ago to the genesis block is safe and complete.  We detect and resolve the double spend/attack, and watch the pool go down in a blaze of glory
to be honest I WANT to see someone attempt a double spend, better to happen now than later.  Bitcoin is still in it's infancy, and a 51% will do nothing more than show how safe and secure bitcoin is.  Andreas does not worry about it because there really is nothing to worry about

While very true, this does not guarantee a malicious miner will actually find the new block, so even if they do not relay a transaction, another miner most likely will on the next block, negating their power to completely prevent a transaction, and also potentially driving everyone away from a mining pool if that is what is causing/doing it
TL;DR the blockchain network is extremely resilient to individual/group interference/attacks, even being completely open to everyone and everything

Of course gold and silver is not good money, bitcoin is no different and is far from good money, and it will not be for years to come (if it ever does) mainly because of it's volatility (in terms of continuous price changes by retailers) and the inability of the state to control the currency (horrific, but we'll leave that debate for another time).  If anything there will be many currencies tied to Bitcoin just the same as currency used to be attached to gold.  Gold has been dug up and used for centuries, and will continue to be valuable far into the future for more than just it's exchange rate
bitcoins require proof of work just the same as gold, the only difference is how the work is performed
what WILL get bitcoin to succeed is treating it realistically and not like some "god send" that will change the world, that is a sure-fire way to drive people away.  
It absolutely will change the world, it already has, but trying to force a feature (currency) on people will drive people away.  Money is a funny thing, most have no clue how it works, and will fight to the death if they think someone is trying to replace it or remove it's value

Usually when the price starts dropping you will usually see a larger than usual transaction volume; it is a possibility the market is not liquid enough to handle large transaction volume increases
On the other hand the correlation could be reversed, price starts dipping a little and then people panic sell causing the volume to go up and price to fall further
TL;DR the market is not liquid enough yet

Zero fee transactions are great for moving coins to cold storage and non-time sensitive transactions that do not matter if they get there in 10 minutes or an hour, as long as they get there
I guess if we have no choice about RBF at least we can still do personal/self transactions (move to/from cold storage) but person to person transactions way too risky as new transaction with fee kills the free one.  Not sure why that uncertainty is being added where it did not exist before; like adding charge backs that plagues credit cards and mostly serves to defraud merchants and raise the cost of all goods, and the merchant is the one that always has to defend themselves, like guilty until proven innocent
edit: end users expect things to just work, they are always expected to use something wrong, so by adding a requirement of waiting for a transaction for 10 minutes when the reason is not easily understandable completely breaks the peer to peer non-reversible contract of bitcoin and intentionally adds uncertainty where it did not exist before

this depends on the type of disks they were using and what brand.  Desktop type hard drives will not trigger SMART failures/correction unless you trigger/check SMART manually or restart the machine, where as enterprise drives constantly check/report SMART
Also, few years ago, I had Seagate drives that appears like it has planned obsolescence built in, both with time and with use.  The heavier the activity, the faster SMART counters of unknown would incriment, or over time the same number increases at a regular pace.  I had 2 servers, 8 Seagate drives, very heavy use database servers...  3 disks failed on the primary server after 3 weeks, switched to secondary and 2 disks failed in there after 2 weeks (as replicas still write) and they were NOT enterprise drives (customer wanted to skimp, told them not to, but the customer is always right...)
TL;DR Always use Enterprise drives for servers, there is a reason they cost more money, and also avoid Seagate drives, as a computer tech I have never seen any other brand of drives with more failures (never mind noticing the potential planned obsolescence)

The problem becomes one of the known and expected increase of value per unit as the amount of bitcoins in circulation never increases.  As more people use the network, more coins will be needed that are not in circulation, so the value of those in circulation have to increase, making the potential of 0.000003 bitcoin transactions for large transactions very real in the future.  Fee requirements on small transactions place artificial limits on a system designed to need exactly the opposite in the future.  Fees were designed to be optional for a reason
this is where many people fall short of understanding.  All current financial systems just add money at the top, making the money at the bottom always have the same perceived value, so a buck today kinda feels/acts like a buck yesterday, and you earn more over time, and prices rise over time but rarely go down.  
Fiat is designed to forever increase to the point it bursts, it always does (everyone always expects their money to be more, so rules are made to keep making them more)
bitcoin was born out of the understanding and wisdom of the very destructive short comings of fiat in the long term for everyone but those at the top where it is always inevitability manipulated for self interests.

You completely miss what caused the great depression, exactly what is going on in the financial system right now, and is the same reason we almost hit another great depression.  Banks gambling with depositors money in the markets and paying/loaning money that they did not actually have not only to un-credit-worthy individuals, but more towards people looking for funds to gamble in the markets is what led to the great depression.  The government steppingg in is only a symptom of the problem created by a currency that can be manipulated in supply at will
These problems are eliminated by a technology that has a fixed and expected supply, and if a fractional banking system is created with bitcoin as the base (which most bitcoiners despise the idea, but businesses need loans to fund large and long term construction, loans are crucial to the economy) we have what the USD used to be. just like the USD was tied to gold and the middle class saw the greatest gains in history, again until it was untied from gold and tied to itself, just like it was before the great depression
the government should be there to prevent abuse by bad businesses and individuals, but instead they reward the individuals with bailouts and keep the problems in place.  I know many people would be "down with the fed" and "down with the government", but those people have no clue what would really happen without either of those as they have not see it in their lifetimes, just like many people did not see the effects of the great depression and do not understand what caused it and thought bailing out the bad players would be a good solution.

what has happened is people that handle the main software implementation got greedy and want more money now.  They are doing everything in their power to drive bitcoin in a direction that is against most users interests, execpt for the people in the core dev ears (blockstream)
the fees in bitcoin were always intended to be minuscule/unnoticed as the expansion of the network over the next 50+ years will allow time for the numerous features already in the bitcoin protocol to be completed, the block reward to continue to diminish (as expected), and the user base to increase greatly to make all the small fees worth it to replace the block reward.
The blockchain network was always intended to remain free/extremely minimal fee, core devs are forcing it into a competition type environment completely against Satoshi's vision, and nobody "important" seams to care
elimination of the free/minimal fee side of bitcoin will be like removing a wheel from a race car and expecting it to still win when you put the wheel in the back seat
this is why so many people are vocal about this direction of bitcoin, and the "main" forums do their best to hide all of these problems from everyone (harm intentional or unintentional) as this will ensure bitcoin technology will almost never achieve much more than what it is now, or at least for the foreseeable future (10+ years), if it even survives once users start leaving in droves (most people only care about monetary gain and not what bitcoin was truly meant to be, barter network between individuals requiring no third party to facilitate a transaction, just the network to move and confirm/secure the transaction)

from what I have been told so far RBF is not the miners choice, it is the clients, but having RBF possibilities on the network adds attack vectors that did not exist before

@_date: 2016-01-15 12:59:45
going from the certainty of getting a transaction to the possibility of not getting it is better? 
clearly that must be wrong as it is making receiving a bitcoin transaction more unsafe and more unclear
this is adding problems that did not exist, whereas everyone's reply is normally "you should wait" is how it used to work to begin with if you so choose to take that risk
end users expect things to just work, they are always expected to use something wrong, so by adding a requirement of waiting for a transaction for 10 minutes when the reason is not easily understandable completely breaks the peer to peer non-reversible contract of bitcoin and intentionally adds uncertainty where it did not exist before

the exchange rate is the result of perceived value of the entire bitcoin network, it is a poor indicator (always will be) of actual bitcoin value, which is perceived value.
if the perceived value is being changed to forget the future and focus on short term, the price needs to correct itself, and will continue to correct itself as long as self inflicted problems exist
the exchange rate could be zero indication no precieved value, but bitcoin technology will still exist just the same

edit: since it is not obvious: the fundamentals is the technology and what it can do for people and how it accomplishes that securely and without 3rd party risks/need, not the speculation on it's exchange rate
Every time there was a significant price rise in the past there was almost always a fairly obvious reason for it, new exposure, new scandal, new feature, new attack, etc and the influx of users and activity would drive the price up then slowly correct itself about half as the market settled over the next few weeks
Speculation on the market is a compliment to Bitcoin, not the reason for Bitcoin and how it managed to move from 2 pizzas for 50,000 Bitcoin to numerous markets that support the increase in network users needs
The speculation has been entirely driving Bitcoin for a while since there has been zero real growth in Bitcoin itself in years, and this is fairly obvious with Bitcoin loosing almost half the market share as users moved elsewhere when blocks became full
price used to follow Bitcoins progress in technology and new users/exposure, now price just follows the speculation since many new users left when they had problems with full blocks and a horrible first experience with Bitcoin, so where is the value behind the price now?
If it is all pure speculation than it is no different than the current fiat markets and will most likely pop like the bubble it has become

Messy code != insecure code, it only means it is more difficult to follow and can increase the likelihood of problems, and that is why you have tests, which should be even more advanced/inclusive than the original code

The network fixes inefficiencies by design, if a better method of mining (more hash rate, less power/space) becomes available/possible everyone moves to that method as running a less efficient method means much less chance of reward
We have already accomplished this 2 times, started with slow CPU, moved to very inefficient video cards (more heat = wasted energy) then on to much more efficient asics, still not great but much better than a cpu

Please read up on [EMP]( it does not destroy things how you may think.  The [skin effect]( is what keeps everyone alive inside a car or plane struck by lightning, and protective devices like a [Faraday cage]( even stop radio signals due to this, or a simple surge suppressor can protect from electrical grid fluctuation due to voltage induction/disruption
I have a degree in electronics (I got into it because it was fun playing with electronics as a kid, and I had a hard lesson in electrical protection with 40,000 volts across my chest), and there is many ways of shielding and protecting electronics, even as simple as an anti-static bag.

that is what they want you to think so people do not use it.  Being entirely open source,  it has allowed security researchers to audit it and was deemed secure. (the audit also started before the project was hushed)
If anything the creators were hushed just like the recent hushing of the wireless repeater project.  Nobody is allowed to talk to anyone about receiving a NSL without immediately going to jail.

I am actually lucky enough to have a great bank that returns up to $10 a month in ATM fees, but it pisses me off my bank has to offer such a service (essentially money wasted instead of going into other services) and for everyone else that does not have a bank like that and they have their earnings leeched away from them with a fee every time they turn around, and the bank is doing absolutely nothing to make that transaction happen other than being there.  I used to have a credit union, but they are not all they are cracked up to be and usually end up "acting like everyone else" ie. finding ways to leech their customers just like the big banks, never mind still getting raped on ATM fees because the credit union debit card is just as uncertain with fees (I travel, so there is not always a ATM within the network or some other bullshit excuse to leech off customers)

PHP is impressive, but the code some people write in PHP is appalling.  In PHP, I wrote a CLI forked server and client that utilizes inotify to know any time a file is modified on the file system, then immediately synchronizes the change with all web servers in the cluster (serving web files from local disk is extremely faster than using network file system).

How about those casino chips people have that can be canceled at any time, is that fake money?  How about the gold bars that are nothing but metal, how about that fake money?
So tell me, where does all the value come from when they print that $40 billion a month?  Oh, thats right, out of the pockets of everyone else in the economy through higher prices, aka inflation
all fiat money is fake money, people just obviously do not understand that be cause they are not taught how the system actually works in school

51% attack still does not guarantee they will get all of the mined coins, and that attack still does nothing to stop bitcoin as they will all continue to exist.  And the link you provided also shows that if there is a major problem with the blockchain it will be overruled by the majority of miners, and still if they had over 51% it does absolutely nothing to all of the transactions completed.
Bottom line if someone does gain that the system will find a way around it.  Or course there is no guarantees but even a successful attack does not stop the technology or take any bitcoins away, it just adds a bump in the road to work around

Technology is getting smaller and smaller every day.  It would be great to have a chip (nfc would be awesome) embedded in the bill that has the ability to generate a wallet internally, and the public key could be read easily with nfc, and printed on the note.  That way it is easily verifiable (with nfc on cell phone/other readers and/or visual pickup) and the wallet is internal to the note.  There could be a way to "unlock" the wallet, allowing retrial of associated bitcoins (wallet) and marking the bill as unsecured/unlocked (readable through the nfc).  Could even reuse the chip somehow get it to generate a new wallet (this could be useful for bills that have no value on the face, but it's balance must be read from, nice for blind bidding/other storage).  
basically need a way to generate a wallet internally, be readable/verifiable with radio, stay secured/tamper proof, and the design is icing on the cake (could be bills, coins, etc), and the bills can easily verifiable and transferable.  When people deposit "notes" they could be exchanged for bitcoins into their own wallets or vice versa.  Extremely versatile and secure notes
I am sure the technology to accomplish this already exists somewhere

even then the state would legislate a way to "regulate it" somehow, either making it illegal if they can not gain complete control or strong-arming the entity running the central ledger.  
Even though economic disaster brought us tighter regulation after the great depression in the US, those in power still thought it was wise to remove almost all those regulations today.  We made a huge mistake and learned from that mistake 60 years ago, we are doing the exact same thing today after those regulations were removed.

Much less safe, if not completely unsafe.   The risk comes from known and unknown exploits that could give complete access to a compromised computer, including running applications and all files.
Keep the computers separate.  The only other way I could think if you just had to do this would be to utilize virtual machines (vm), the risk comes from having access to the virtual machines disks if the attacker discovers the vm's, if not gaining complete control over the vm's
edit: the virtual machines can be turned off, and if utilized full disk encryption much closer to separate computers, could have isolated networking (safer than physical possibly), and much much easier to work with than physical machine

@_date: 2012-04-14 20:20:57
You see it incorrectly, they do not block transactions at all, and effectively they only prevent transactions from verifying properly.  If you pannic and sell everything, your loss.  Controlling 51% of verifying transactions means really nothing, it does not guarantee in any way that they would actually mine the coins, and the community could update the software to ignore any transactions from a mining source that controls too much of the network.  You also forget that there is numerious forks of the BTC software, so already mounting an effective attack against one is difficult, against multiple?  forget it.
That being said BTC is still volitle, but is a great inventment in our future if it succeeded, and I guarantee it will succeed in one way or another.
Even if the internet was shut down tomorrow, I still would have my bitcoins and would continue to have them when the internet comes back, it is up to the comunity to resolve problems, again the link you provided shows specifically this
@_date: 2012-04-14 20:49:29
These are not the only solutions, there are other discussions in the bitcoin forums.
Only time will tell, the community has brought it this far, and you focus on only one possibility of a problem, which is still not a failure of Bitcoin.  
As the link says:

the coin has an associated bitcoin address, wallet private key is under the hologram sticker on the back.  The physical coin retains value of 1BTC as long as that sticker is intact (it is damaged when removed)
Handing this coin to another person is like handing them $13, they can keep the value in the coin or peel the sticker and retrieve to their wallet leaving them with a fancy paper weight

Crash would entail something breaking/failing/becoming unusable and that is not what will happen, and it still only relates to exchange rate, not bitcoin itself
If I was describing bitcoin to someone on the street, I most certainly would not use the word crash, a much better word would even be settle, whereas bitcoin settles back to $9 exchange rate
Of course we are still at $10.50 today...

The banks could be very useful in spreading the use of bitcoin.  Not everyone will ever understand how bitcoin works, and banks could be where people can go to for handling bitcoins and safety and guarantees of their coins, and can also be an exchange for physical bitcoins.  The banks could insure a persons coins and could use the deposits for investlments the same as banking works now.  If everyone hates the banks bitcoin will never reach it's full potential. 
We really do need to stop all the bashing, the banks are just playing in a system that can be rigged to begin with, bitcoin could could be the backbone that gives a much more even playing field for the entire world
I hate the banks as much as the next person, but they are crucial to the way things work, but the problem we have now is the banks can rig the system for themselves (once again)
If the system has all the money to fight off attacks from the outside you change it from the inside out.

Noobs are what brought bitcoin to where it is now, everyone was a noob at one time (even the devs), and many others helped the noobs in the past, including myself.  In the past bitcoin was just risky if there was a fatal problem, now it is beyond risky as it has not failed but is severely crippled with no end in sight because even if SW activated right now we would not realize it's "benefits" until people use mostly SW transactions, doing nothing for the backlog now or into the foreseeable future
the tech never use to have this many self-inflicted problems and the majority of the time it was an end user error and not a problem with the bitcoin network itself
bitcoin will only succeeded with many many more users than what we have now, and that is absolutely impossible with planned "scaling" solutions

Your bitcoin wallet does not need to be online for you to accept bitcoins.  You can store your wallet.dat on a thumb drive and keep it in desk draw.  Best of all you do not need to keep all your bitcoins in the receieving wallet, and could split into "savings" wallets, stored away (out of sight out of mind).  Can't remember who said it, but if you don't want your information stolen, do not plug it into the internet.  This was inevitable, but also needed as now people will secure their wallets even more now.
edit: most of all wallet should be encrypted and secured and only opened when needed.

I am very educated about bitcoin specifics and internals, I have been working with it for years.   I I run multiple servers for bitcoin at my local data center, looked/worked with bitcoin code, and read over the white paper quite a few times.
The entire premise of bitcoin, the entire reason I am here, is that in one technology I require no intermediary to send absolutely any amount I want, dust or millions of coins, a few transaction or a million transaction per minute, for the fee that I choose
I have been in this a long time, I have never seen anything till now that could destroy the momentum of bitcoin...  Till now.

It would be better if we would stop saying it is free, that is not the reality, and will scare people away (nothing in life is free).  Sure you can send a transaction with no miner fee, but the greatest qualities of bitcoin are lost, ie. confirmed withing 10 minutes, potentially reversible (if not picked up by a miner), etc.

I am unsure if people understand what is happening here and how Cloudflare works.  Tor exit nodes have absolutely nothing to do with Cloudflare, and do not "use" them in any way.
What is really happening is people are trying to access a website that uses Cloudflare, and there are many different sites that use them.  Cloudflare can see that there is many requests for very different websites trying to access their sites through their system from the same IP address, and this is very indicative of bot activity, so the requests are met with a "human check".  Once this check is completed, normal browsing would resume, but the same problem still exists of many different peoples requests going through an exit node that look like a single IP address to Cloudflare.  If this situation happens fast enough, or intentionally, this could cause the check system to continue to human check you.  The system is working as designed most likely, the problem is Cloudflare site protection,t hat website owners enable, is not acting how Cloudflare would have hoped/designed.
TL;DR traffic through exit nodes look like virus/bot activity, and a human check is happening too fast or improperly, and has absolutely nothing to do with Tor; this has nothing to do with MITM attacks.

Good elaboration on the hidden costs mostly passed on to consumers (my snippy comment sure did not do that), but the second part is regarding retailers are SOL with stolen card charge back because the CC company expects retailers to know if a persons card is stolen, even if impossible to know, but the retailer is the one that looses overall, and passes that on to consumers (if possible)
Unfortunately there is no predicting any of this, and a retailer that keeps prices low and has little to no charge backs for years could all of the sudden be hit with tons of charge backs, no way to build that into price of goods, and the retailer has to eat it and raise prices at that time (if they can)
Consumers see none of the nightmares retailers face when accepting CC, and I have setup numerous businesses with CC processing, and have seen how horrible and risky it is to accept CC, but if you do not accept them, you are screwed also (lost sales potential); loose loose situation
@_date: 2015-11-24 18:26:38
No, they are entirely using bitcoin, their services are built entirely on bitcoin.
The other I can not talk about, but it uses alternate networks to move transactions, ie, not peer to peer bitcoin

It gets even worse, in my area recently there has been many instances of cards being skimmed somewhere somehow, then cloned and physically used somewhere else.  Someone bought card and flowers at market in jersey with business partners cc and we are in Massachusetts...  As "legit" a transaction as it gets, at least to the retailer
If the US had chip and pin that other countries have had/required for years then retailers would not be so badly affected by these situations
The worst part of all is CC companies have absolutely no incentive to change or fix anything because they are not the ones eating all the fraud AND have to deal with PCI compliance that really does not work, and more fees to retailers to maintain PCI

What should really be happening is if any new accounts trigger the filter they are then looked at by an actual person before rejected, simple

@_date: 2015-03-01 01:57:43


that is the key word, they are in no way prevented from spending that (the client may prevent it, but anyone could compose a manual transaction)
lets put it this way, the miners are in no way in between the source and the destination, they are not required to perform the transaction.  
Take the traditional system, where the bank has to handle the source money, transmit the transaction, then a bank handles the destination account.  In many cases this can be automated, but the banks are who determine what account to debit and credit, the banks are *handling* and *transmitting* the money, electronic or physical.  
The same applies to extensions of the traditional sytstem, like PayPal.  they are still handling the source account and transmitting the change to a bank, they are essentially a new type of bank.  There is many risks to banking systems, as enormous trust is placed in the bank and all of it's communications between other banks.  Being licensed to operate means they have shown they are capable of being trusted connected to a system that allows you to essentially pull money from anyone's account you please. There is much security in place to prevent this, but take the recent discovery of a virus that stole a billion dollars from many peoples accounts, no action on their part needed, just money extracted
Now take blockchain technology.  None of this exists.  There is really nothing moving.  This is an entry in a transaction ledger, nothing more.  If you have the private key you can sign the entry in the ledger.  This transaction is entirely complete, 1 action by the "sender", no other intermediaries needed, and everyone almost immediately knows about it.  The only reason mining and confirmations are needed is to show that you have not signed another transaction already, but nothing stops you from doing this.  Then the only thing the miners do is look at all those transactions and creates a confirmation, in no way touching the transactions, all it is doing is adding a "stamp of approval".
In addition to all of this, everyone's account is never available for anyone to take at any time, all transaction have to be signed from the private key holder only, it is a one way transaction, no trust is needed to be sure you are not a bad guy (virus) that wants to take money from everyone account without any action on their part (this of course has nothing to do with lack of security of your private keys.  A person would never leave a pile of cash on their front porch or even their kitchen table, they would put it in a safe or out of sight at least, the same goes for private keys, or wallets)
TL;DR miners are in absolutely no way a money transmitter

great stuff, I did a quick program in nodejs to serve the bitcoin address, no need to have a full web server running if not needed.
save this script to a file named index.js, be sure to put you bitcoin address in, and you may need to change the users to run as to fit your system (this is done on Ubuntu, but can run anywhere nodejs does)
    var http = require('http');
    try {
    	// create a simple webserver and bind to port 80
    	http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    	  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
    	  res.end('&lt;meta name="bitcoin" value="13AC5Dc2zmxbhFJ1kDVzCEXLmf7nR85rfg"&gt;');
    	}).listen(80);
    } catch (err) {
    	console.log("Unable to start server on port 80, did you start as root?)
    	process.exit(1);
    }
    try {
    	// since we need to start as root we must drop our privileges to be safe
    	process.setgid('nogroup');
    	process.setuid('nobody');
    } catch (err) {
    	console.log("Unable to drop privileges");
    	console.log(err);
    	console.log("exiting");
    	process.exit(1);
    }
test the server:
    sudo node index.js
If you have no errors then you can now setup to run at boot
install pm2 to allow easy start of server
    sudo npm install -g pm2 
start the webserver:
    sudo pm2 start index.js
then you can start at boot:
    sudo pm2 startup ubuntu index.js

I have to disagree, myself, and I am sure others, got into bitcoin purely because of the technology, and never focused on the exchange rate other than like it was a really interesting game.  If it survives (does not break, exchange rate will do nothing to kill it), it will change the world way more than it already has
TL;DR I could see the technological potential far outweighed the current exchange rate

I found nothing in that link about who assumes responsibility for fraud;  I did find this though




I have setup numerous business with CC processing (present and not present), and have never seen them get the funds back for any reason, fraud or not.  Where did you find information that they do?  Who inevitably takes the loss?
I found this with a quick search:


chip and pin would only potentially help in this one situation where card was present, and not help completely.  Chip and pin also do nothing for card not present transactions, which will only increase as time goes on...

And this is where the existing banking system meshes well with bitcoin (if they wanted), your deposits are secured and guaranteed by the institution, and you do not have to worry about your active wallet, and can still keep savings away from bank and printed in a paper wallet.  Plus you have the added bonus of the bank handling all conversions if you so choose, with a debit card the circle of integration with bitcoin and current system is almost complete
So many possibilities
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:46:56
I have printed paper wallets a few times, and I always end up throwing them away before I use them for this reason, stolen/lost paper and all is lost.
I ended up printing (and saving various places) papers that have random strings that have to be put back together in a specific way and then used as the password for a brainwallet.  That way the brainwallet password is 30+characters, and the wallet itself exists nowhere, not even printed.  Even if I give someone the paper with the strings, they have no idea how to use them unless I tell them how.  I also have someone I instructed how to use (executioner of my will), but they do not have the papers (those are with someone else).  More than anything, no password has to be memorized (if it was encrypted before printing), and the method to reassemble is relatively easy and impossible to forget.  Even if someone stole the papers, they have no idea what they are
So unless someone figures out a way to crack an insanely long password with letters, numbers, and characters, all should be well (hopefully)

You still fail to see my point, comparing the number of users is just as useless of a comparison, gold has far fewer users than the USD, does that make it any less important since it also uses the banking system and servers to track and transfer values/shipments?
bitcoin needs none of that, it is more effecient than all other current currencies, even with the relatively smaller amount of users to USD in terms of both resource/electricity usage and also in terms of transfer safety and efficiency, and the small amount of electricity needed to secure the currency with really nothing else (no guards, no buildings, no bankers, no tellers) is absolutely amazing, and will still be just as simple and efficient if bitcoin grows to the size of a national currency

Gold has the value that you can make pretty things from it and people assign an exchange rate to it also (which is not guaranteed in any way), bitcoin has value in it's technology (which can never be uninvented) not it's exchange rate.  Not only has bitcoin achieved world wide usage in a short period of time, it has also not been built out to its full capabilities yet of smart properties, smart contracts, automatic/triggered transactions, etc, all specified in the bitcoin protocol, all possible right now if anyone in the world wrote the code to handle it
Fiat has come and gone throughout history, to keep it from going it eventually gets inflated to insane amounts where you pay a million xyz for something at one time cost a 100 xyz.  Will the same fate fall on USD?  Nobody can predict the future, and there is nothing stopping it from happening, even the fed reserve (which some would argue quickens the problem)
Of all the people in the world, a small percentage actually has access to banking services, many more people have cell phones than a bank account, and all of them can immediately use bitcoin if they choose, no applications, no hurdles, just immediately start using a worldwide network for verifiable exchange of value that can not be manipulated by any person or government, and all transactions permanent recorded and verified in an accounting ledger held by and agreed upon by everyone, the block chain, and this is bitcoins greatest value, the technology that has ever existed to allow confirmation of transactions (not double spent) without a third party
Calling bitcoin a currency has caused more issues in giving others more ways to attack what they do not understand.  Bitcoin is many things, like a precious scarce metal, a payment network, and usable as an exchange of value, but all just a technology.  The current exchange rate is highly volatile because of how new the technology is and how small the market capitalization is. If you want to understand the value, you absolutely have to understand the technology.
Will bitcoin replace fiat?  probably not, it is closer to gold in this respect where it can be used for exchange of value (but not really goods and services anymore), but can be difficult to use in every day transactions for the entire world.  However, bitcoin is already differentiated itself in the respect it CAN be used as an exchange of value for goods and services today, and the number of merchants accepting is growing by the day.  Due to built in protocol limits, I would expect to see another digital currency in the future that has it's base tied (child of, not a clone) to bitcoin that allows for the properties that current transaction networks use, like credit card networks, and also credit in general, where the secondary digital currency can have credit pools and their associated risks.  This has the added bonus of keeping bitcoin chain itself from getting bloated and out of control, but still allowing for easy/fast commerce still tied to the value of bitcoin.  Credit is crucial to being able to fund construction, businesses, etc. Many people that do not understand credit hate it and can not see how vital it can be to an economy.  But it can also be a huge detriment to an economy when the credit is basically based on itself, leading to huge bubbles and eventual collapses.  History has shown what happens with this (great depression), and unfortunately the USD is once again in the same boat.  Will it happen the same way as last time?  hopefully not, but nobody can predict the future.  This is also arguably/potentially why bitcoin was born to begin with
TL;DR the value of bitcoin is entirely in the underlying technology, all of the clones like litecoin and dodgecoin are the same technology, just modified to suit their creators needs/wants when starting the new networks.

Awesome, but a few questions:
Do you incorporate the JS from brainwallet to keep decoding in browser, and what is the security/actions between entering passphrase and how is derived wallet used?  Is it ever stored or everything done in memory?  How do you protect the extension from other extensions that may be malicious (is that possible?)?
Great stuff, look forward to incorporating into another extension if possible (if open source licence, have not looked at extension yet.  Is there a repo for this?)

Violence is entirely the symptom of control.  A great example was alcohol prohibition, insane amounts of violence only because alcohol was illegal, and once legalized the violence associated with it mostly vanished.  We see the same exact violence with drug prohibition, again a symptom of control.  Want to eliminate drug violence?  Eliminate it's financial incentives that only exist from its illegality
Money used to control and manipulate others results in violence, violence from the hatred of control, violence from attempts to gain more control, violence to maintain control
There is also another large cause of violence, religion, again about control, but not getting into that one

Interesting, by the way Prolexic presents themselves, it would appear they would most likely help mitigate attacks in this manner (but they do not specifically mention it), so then the question becomes, if they are using them, why are they offline for so long?
If this is only traffic overload then Prolexic should be able to mitigate.  If this is a inability to handle the volume of transactions, then Mt.Gox might need to think about splitting up their trading servers and assign users across servers

In comparison with other open source products in terms of the number of people, experts, researchers, hackers, governments looking at the code of bitcoin dwarfs the number of people that look at closed systems.  The fact that bitcoin has obtained a relatively high exchange rate only means that many more people are looking at the system and the code and trying to game it or break it.  Am I saying bitcoin is perfect?  no, only time will tell with many more researchers giving their seal of approval. 
Heck, look at the simple fact that bitcoin can not be reversed, and compare that to the untold amounts of stolen credit cards, compromised accounts, fraudulent charge-backs, all which can not ever exist with bitcoin.  
top all that off with the fact that the bitcoin ledger is held by everyone on the network (with exception to certain clients), all of those transactions have been verified up to this point, and even if there was a discovered hole/compromise, that does nothing to transactions that have already been verified to this point, meaning still nothing is lost, and transaction processing can continue once the hole is fixed.
Which one is more secure here?

Echo chamber yes, but not of greed but of excitement, greedy people would not care about bitcoin as they would only see it as tulips

Please, some minor research, the fees generated within transactions that are mined will take over/eclipse the amounts of bitcoins rewarded over the next 100 years.  Mining, in whatever form it becomes (ASIC or better) will ALWAYS be essential to the security of the network, even well after all coins are mined, and is crucial to move transactions through the network

absolutely, what it does in reality is make new problems by moving the drug health problem to the streets that create incentives for gangs to make money and create more violence, and create huge drug cartels that are more powerful than governments, ONLY because it is illegal
but this has been going on for 40+ years, and bitcoin has only existed for a few years.  It is questionable if bitcoin makes it easier, more likely that it just modernizes distribution to a point, but I would have to argue it would be easier and "safer" to still get from the street corner than to buy from online (I see it every day)
just like with actual violence has been declining (even though people believe it is getting worse), it only comes down to more expose of the violence, and bitcoin brings more exposure to the health problem that has existed for centuries

You are no longer talking about bitcoin and talking about a fiat type fractional reserve system.  
 My point is that BITCOIN, the same as GOLD, can never have more that what you already have, and making a system of CREDITS on top of bitcoin is still nothing to do with bitcoin itself
TL,DR bitcoin can never be made into a fractional system, a fractional system can be built ON TOP of bitcoin

no regulation scares away those that insist on some type of regulation, not as a preventative law, but a shielding type of law saying using it can never be declared illegal somehow
as much as I hate regulation, I have the feeling some type of regulation will be needed; hopefully not an attempt to prevent or restrict actions with bitcoin (that will be the dust country)
even China is not preventing people from reporting/talking about bitcoin, and some would even say they are encouraging it, and I completely expected them to attempt to clamp down (boy was I surprised)

Now I know that it can be bypassed "easily" and still obtain your password, but in reality if I just had my phone stolen, I can go login and change my password, and the simple pin gives me some extra time
but most of all, just in case, I do not want others to be able to easily see my wallet on my phone.  If I lend my phone or forget it somewhere briefly, there is no chance someone could just open the client.

no this is reality, if people hold 10 bitcoins in an account, you will forever have 10 bitcoins to loan out.  If you want more the only way is to have a system of credits on top of those bitcoins, as much as you do not want to believe that.
You feel like I am trolling because I have been trying to get this across to you the entire time, but you still appear to believe you can create bitcoins out of thin air that are the same as other bitcoins, but in reality are the same as litecoin, or any other (fractional) currency that can be converted to bitcoins, which can not be replicated

OP_CHECKMULTISIG is already a implemented and supported as a non-standard transaction type, so all existing bitcoin clients will accept the transactions, and that is what the blockchain services uses for multi-signature transaction.  So this would be more of a bitcoin client option to make it easier for people to utilize/connect to a 3rd party service.  I would imagine this could also happen in a service like BitPay that handles the transactions for you, but instead of them having complete access to your coins, they could generate the receiving address you have the 3rd key to, then that also eliminates complete trust in the transaction processor and or a single processor (could have multiple signatures/services) (I am hypothesizing here, I have not truly dug into the inner workings of multi-signature transactions)

As for taxes they can still be taken from your pay by your employer before you are paid, the employer will still be required to pay taxes and file reports indicating as such, and just like we had taxes when everyone was working with cash before, they still paid their taxes
As for hyperinflation, the eventual result of fiat without constant economic growth, have a look at the numerous countries that already and currently experience this, people that do not get into bitcoin (or whatever currency evolves) will be no different than the people already at the bottom of the hyper-inflated currency, and the people that are at the top will wall themselves off in rich communities; this will be the result and no matter how much people hate those that could see what was coming and moved to bitcoin (or whatever), the world will continue to turn
Bottom line, just like many other fiat currencies that came and went, it is not bitcoin that destroyed them, they destroyed themselves, bitcoin just happens to be a way for the little man to finally have a leg up when the shit does hit the fan, just like others in the past with precious metals and assets that allowed them to emerge from the ashes, and so will those involved in the new global economy of bitcoin

good chart, but you have to take into account the cycles and their reasoning, it is not going to be only logarithmic.  Going over that chart, as you see before Jan the price was relatively small movements (and people involved had a good understanding of the technology and/or it's potential).   In Jan-Feb the price started to climb, bringing in more attention and more users, and in turn more speculation and hype.  Then Mar-April, there was more media exposure, more influx, etc bringing to the the rally/spike in Apr, about double the rate before the rally, but major news orgs and bigger fish were still relatively ignoring and/or spouting it's doom.  Then the correction to 80-100 range and things held relatively steady slow climb with the new users, then on to Oct-Nov where we hit the next rise and influx of users, much more media exposure, more big fish, more big news, more merchants accepting, etc. which brought us to our next spike/rally a short time ago, now it is correcting again.  If it was the same gloom and doom from regular new orgs, we would be seeing closer to $400, but more people and places actually have positive information rather than gloom and doom, with the bigger fish, etc, I expected it to be closer to $600 and slowly rise to our next destination (hopefully)
The scarcity and utility of bitcoin is huge in comparison to existing systems.  Some would say it could reach $10,000, so that has to be taken into account on the scale long term, some say it will go to zero, but those that look at the gloom and doom fail to realize the exchange rate is not what made bitcoin, and even if the rate dropped drastically, it would do nothing to the bitcoins themselves and the network will continue to function just as it is now, so there technically is no way to crash bitcoin.  On top of all of this we have not even seen it's compete potential of colored coins, smart properties, contracts, etc.

what are you talking about?  I know what fractional reserve banking is, it can not ever be applied to bitcoin itself.  If someone wants to create a fractional type system based on bitcoin there is nothing stopping them.  the USD, a fractional reserve system, was at one time based on gold, then they broke that bond years ago and started taking the fractional currency and making fractions of the fractions, and that is the problem.   I never disputed the value of FRB, I am stating that bitcoin in of itself can never be twisted into a FRB system any more than gold itself
so who is in denial here exactly?

Before people downvote Cloudflare comments, YES they would be useful in this situation, not because of caching, but because they would be the only ones making the requests to the actual Mt.Gox servers.   
Cloudflare is much more than a cache mechanism, they can also be the link between your services and the rest of the internet, and when being attacked, Cloudflare can mitigate attacks much more easily than any lone internet provider ever could, for multiple reasons.  One, they have huge amounts of bandwidth, but more than that, they use anycast, which is like kryptonite for DDOS
Cloudflare uses [anycast routing]( and I highly recommend everyone take a look at [Load Balancing without Load Balancers]( on their blog.  The IP address that people around the world get is different when resolving Mt.Gox, which means the attacks are spread across all of their data centers, preventing a huge flood of traffic to the actual servers at Mt.Gox.  Mt.Gox can further protect themselves by limiting requests into their server to only be from Cloudflare.  They even mitigated (mostly) the recent largest DDOS the world has seen.
TL;DR I use Cloudflare myself, I researched how they operate also, and they are much much more than just a caching mechanism (which you can actually turn off)

Not all online wallet services are created equal, and saying do not use online wallets only serves to spread FUD.  Online wallets (like blockchain.info) are incredibly useful for mobile phones and any other low power device that can not/should not run a full wallet.
As others have said in comments blockchain.info does not have your private key, and also offers multi-factor authentication to get into your wallet in addition to a secondary wallet password.
Personally I have had my blockchain wallet for over a year, have it setup on multiple mobile devices and multiple desktops, never had a problem.  I do not however, keep all ov my coins in my online wallet and still run a desktop client AND have printed wallets/offline wallets.  Never keep all your eggs in one basket

there is no belief here, that is the point of bitcoin, you do not have to believe in anything, it is math an encryption and not single person/entity/state to make bitcoin itself fail, EVERYBODY would have to agree to stop mining bitcoin, EVERYBODY would have to agree to stop trading it;  this is akin to getting everyone to stop trading gold, never going to happen
this is not a belief, it is education and knowledge, which is hard to come by people unwilling to learn something new and attack it because they do not understand it

They are only managing the transaction, and you can choose to have it sent to your fiat account or to your own bitcoin address or percentage of each (bitpay).  Services like these will be crucial to the bitcoin network as they make it much easier for businesses to interact with their customers, and also lower the risk to the merchant by guaranteeing the exchange rate at time of transaction
TL;DR they are a transaction facilitator, not storage (unless you choose to with coinbase)

originally a free service (startssl), but in order for me to get a cert with bitcoin in the url they forced me to register (I want to secure elctrum server, but they felt it was for money use).  I was fine with giving up a licence, then they wanted a birth certiface, then a utility bill, then my cell bill (which I could not provide as I do not have the account), then I was SOL but to wait for them to send a registered letter, just complete bullshit, but I really liked their interface, and the price can not be touched with as much as you get...

I fully understand the situation, and any argument that bitcoin is somehow an environmental disaster is sensationalist bullshit.  If anything the amount of power bitcoin is using has drastically DECREASED in terms of processing power with the transition from CPU to video card processing to ASIC, and it will only get better as the technology is improved.
The technology for processing our existing financial system has if anything INCREASED in power usage in attempts to gain even shorter transaction processing times in trading on the stock market, and the technology of credit cards has not changed at all
bitcoin hashing secures the entire bitcoin network, from the base currency itself to moving transactions through the network, nothing more is needed to secure it, while our existing financial system throws more and more money and resources in an attempt to prevent fraud and counterfeiting which will never be eliminated no matter how much is thrown at it.  Bitcoin is already secure and counterfeit proof, even at the small amount of processing power it is already at in comparison to market size, and will be forever
TL;DR people do not understand how our existing financial system works, and attempt to pull BS out of their ass for arguments against bitcoin

But even at that the network comes to consensus on new encryption and the network moves on where it left off, sure the exchange rate would take a dive, but every transaction up to the point of being broken is already secure/complete

@_date: 2013-08-28 15:02:23


lol of course
my point was not anything against FRB itself, my point is that it would have nothing really to do with bitcoin itself, and would just be another system people need to "trust", just as they already trust banks
bitcoin will never turn into FRB, ever, simple as that, no matter how much people try to say it, the technology is not capabe of such a "feature".  but that does not in any way stop people from setting up whatever they want off chain

Apples and oranges.  If you want to take apples (bitcoins) and loan out more than you have they are no longer apples at all, and the oranges you loan out are not any less valuable if people accept that they can at any time trade 1 orange for 1 apple, and that is FRB, it has nothing to do with apples anymore, but everyone believes their oranges are just as valuable, and so they are, until people realize the apples are gone entirely and their oranges are now worthless, but the possibility of everyone trading their oranges at the same time is near impossible/prevented through regulation
But what happens when someone starts making hundreds of thousands of oranges out of nowhere?  Now that 1 orange is worth a piece of a seed from the apple, even if people do not see it happening
Fractional reserve banking is very useful, and honestly needed to allow an economy to grow, as long as the basis for the fractions do not themselves turn into fractions of a fraction, and that is what we have now, but so many people do not see this, usually until it is too late

If there was a law attempting to stop bitcoin it would most likely cover other/all virtual currencies, but the law still would make no difference as bitcoin is world wide and we would only hurt ourselves in the US by attempting to ban it

You do not need to hold coins in cold storage, you can keep them in numerous clients and use them any time (QT, electrum, armory, etc).  Even blockchain.info allows complete online access to your coins, but the wallet is worked with in the browser only, the coins are in your control, not stored with someone else 
And with a currency designed to be entirely in your control, why would you trust all of them with anyone else?
@_date: 2013-05-07 02:28:12
For the most part you are looking at [Capital Gains] ( but it all depends on your original investment.  For example, if you invested $100 and purchased 1 BTC, then you held that coin until it reached $200 and then sold it for cash, you have capital gains of $100.
Things get trickier when you directly use your coins for a purchase.  Depending on the purchase, you would most likely owe a sales tax somewhere (and just because it is not collected at time of purchase does not mean you do not owe the taxes).  I am unsure where other taxes would fit in here (would you still owe capital gains if you never converted to cash)
The best part is if you have held your investment, you owe nothing until you either exchange for cash or use the coins
Best bet is to talk to an accountant, ask them how to handle a commodity type investment like gold, they will be able to understand from there.  If you feel you owe money, file your taxes and they will just send you a bill.  When you receive the bill you can do a payment plan as needed, if needed (I have done this)
Of course there is other comments in here to the effect of "ignore it, they would not know", but that is not the best of routes to take, and the IRS can come back at you when you least expect it and hit you with tons of fines

Bitcoins themselves can not be duplicated/loaned to multiple people, that is the basis of how bitcoin works, ensuring it is impossible to double spend coins
However, a separate (virtual) currency can be created to do FRB, just like the system we already have, but at least it can be tied to value of bitcoin, like how USD used to be
@_date: 2013-08-28 14:43:09
than you are not talking about using bitcoins, you are talking about off chain transactions that are tied in no actual way to bitcoins themselves, and would require usage of the off chain system to convert the fractional money to bitcoins, just like everything is happening now
what you are talking about is the equivalent of taking the USD in your pocket now, looking up the serial number, and seeing what gold bar it was tied to, but still not an actual gold bar (hypothetically of course if USD was tied to any real value anymore)
yes, some type of fraction banking will be needed so businesses can get the capital they need quickly and easily, but the foundation of the currency can not be destroyed as in what is happening right now to USD

breaking what law?  Are the intentions of the service to launder money?  and what money are you talking about?  bitcoin is not even considered money when it really comes down to it.  
regulation does not magically make a tool legal, if anything regulation would be used to make something that was completely legal into something illegal.
Am I saying all regulation is bad? no.  Am I saying there is a fine line they are walking? yes, but they are still not breaking any laws

There is nothing stopping anyone from taking existing source, modifying it, and running thier own protocol, one perfect example is litecoin
The thing is who will use it?  Bitcoin in its current form is where most effort and focus is now (mining), it will forever be the one that started the bitcoin, so that in itself has most value. 
If a state came along and said you all must use our protocol, the world would have to be in complete agreement to use one states protocol only, never going to happen and have better chance of getting hit by lightning then falling off a cliff into a grinder
Bitcoin itself only exists because of of the miners that work to move transactions through the network and get a reward of coins and all transaction fees, and all of them decide bitcoins fate
Even if a exchange decided to go rouge then all of the people that are part of that pool would move to another, so even mining pools are not a threat.
Just too many reasons bitcoin will ever go away, but does nothing to stop a state from using it to create their own version of the chain, but then that would just bring more focus to bitcoin

historical performance may have not been the best wording, more a historical pattern.  I was looking at in terms of historical boom cycles, the exchange rate would spike with new influx of attention/users/excitement, then drop with the panic/etc, then finally find a spot in the middle between the previous low (before the boom) and the height of the boom (the mems you see here are really indictive of what happens)
This is the previous boom:  
 
There is certainly no guarantees what will happen, but I expected the price to be about $600 as more people invested now less willingness to let coins go for too low of a value (selling for &lt;500 when you bougt closer to 1000 would be desperation at the moment)
all speculation here, just as everyone else, but I never expected the price to stay over $1000 right now

Multbit was awesome, I was thoroughly disappointed with all the corruption issues I had, and it looks like I am not the only one...

No need to be sad, the effect of the price dropping after being over $100 for months means that people that thought it was too late/did not have enough money can now buy in.  The more people with bitcoin means more people with vested interest in it succeeding.  The exchange rate has not changed the amount of bitcoins in circulation
TL;DR lower price potentially means people can buy in cheaper that may have never bought in, spreading bitcoin to more people meaning more potential customers that can pay for services with bitcoin

I didn't say I did not like FRB, I just understand how it can be manipulated and molested by messing with the base units, and that is where I have a problem, and where the country has a problem they just can not see

As soon as an attack on the network happens (which must happen eventually for bitcoin to be viable tried and tested), the only problem is transaction processing is hindered and people choose to put the processing on hold.  While this in iteself can be very bad for business, the coins as they exist now in the network are STILL THERE and not lost in any way
In the long run a 51% attack will help strengthen the network and causes NO PROBLEMS for coins already confirmed in people wallets.  To top it off the more successful bitcoin becomes, the more problematic an attack would be for the attacker, just think what would happen if all bank transfer capability for the entire country grinded to a halt?  depending on the attack people could loose their entire accounts, entire banks could fail, but none of that is a problem for bitcoin
Also an attack on the bitcoin network does nothing to stop people from using Casascius coins or something similar that does not require the bitcoin network for transfer

Some people are more willing to resort to violence for their beliefs, some are more willing to conform and fit in
Of course this does not cover those with actual mental health problems (willing to die for your beliefs is not a mental health issue however)
edit: to elaborate, speaking for myself, I can be the most kind and caring person you would ever meet, will go out of my way to help anybody, but disrespect myself or my family the anger you will see would scare the crap out of most people.  If anyone actually harmed my family or attacked me, well, they better kill me, because they will not live to speak about it (I speak from experience in terms of someone attacking me, and if there was not for someone there to stop me defending myself, it would have been ugly)
I would have to say that violence is normally used when all other peaceful options are eliminated.  When it comes to things like the drug war, there is no peaceful options available, so all we are left with is violence to protect something that equates to businesses competing for market demand.

I hate social networks, but have a page i never use just so i don't get strange looks from others when a computer tech/programmer/network admin says they do not have a FB account.  I greatly value my privacy, and that of others, so if i had the time i would contribute to related projects.  I would be talking to everyone as i am sure they are as interested in bitcoin as i am.  Avoiding cameras, well, maybe not that one...
Someone like myself that knows much more about bitcoin than most people in the world ever will could be a very knowledgeable resource lost to others wanting to learn bitcoin, at worst I am avoided and shunned and/or life made hell with accusations because i do not use my FB account to shit my privacy down the drain

The ability to receive payment for for such horrible acts has nothing to do with the currency, what we should really focus on is what motivates people to do such things (poverty/drugs being illegal instead of treated as a medical issue/need money/the problems helped the most when there is a basic safety net)
Besides this, a kidnapper could already force someone to just wire them the money to an account that can not be tracked and still be paid just as fast as bitcoin, if not easier
and the bottom line is easier payment is not all of the sudden cause some boost to the kidnapping "industry", everything that can be done with bitcoin can and is already done with current payment systems and forms

I would recommend, if you already have not, having a look at [Satoshis' paper]( to get a good understanding of how the network should work in relation to how the code works, and also allow you to create tests against the code to ensure the results are as expected

INTEREST is something that the institution would EARN from the REPAYMENT of a loan, and if they did not have the money to begin with, they have no way of loaning something they do not have


you are correct, but by you "lending" that same coin to multiple people, that is not bitcoin itself in any way, you are using something of value and dividing it into FRACTIONS that do NOT equal the original value, but if you manage to fool enough people into believing it has the same value, good for you, and that is how our current banking system works

You have a few problems with voting:
    
* people legitimately registered to vote/only able to cast a single vote (which is really not a huge problem, but somehow it gets made into one)
* being able to vote and having no way to confirm your specific votes (otherwise people could sell their votes).
* having the specific votes unvisible until the local election official concludes voting
* making sure votes are secure/signed/unchangable
* make as much of the system public as possible
* has to be easy to use and understand/foolproof
I thought of this one the other day, but unsure how much of an extension of bitcoin would be needed, if even possible.  When people register to vote they would receive a "voting coin" (colored coin?) of some kind, this would be your "registration" to vote. That coin would be used to retrieve a "ballot coin" at the time of voting that has an unknown address but is used to sign the actual votes along with the "district coin" (more on this later). All of these coins act like individual wallets.
The day of elections, all of the voting places would receive an allotment of ballot coins that would be used for the actual voting, and is tied to the actual voting location (we would already know how many are needed for each location based on registrations, but could be easily issued more by the state in case of many first time voters to a district).  Since we can not tie a person to a vote, when people arrive to vote, they use their voting coin to confirm their registration with the receptionist, and then they use the voter coin to retrieve a ballot coin that is then taken to the voting machine (or the voting machine could be immediately loaded at the station by your voting coin). After voting is done, the ballot is digitally signed with the ballot coin (to prevent alteration), and the voting coin is then used for that election cycle and can not be used again to retrieve a ballot coin until next election.  Ballot coins are generated (colored?) and issued to districts the day of elections and are one use only (the coins themselves could be reused if used to immediately create a new wallet once it is used to vote and sent to the new wallet for the next election), 
The ballot chain, publically available and visible how many are available/issed to a district for that election, would show immediate results to the point of how many people have voted in certain districts, but the votes themselves would be encrypted with the district coin.  When the ballot is cast, it is signed/hashed with the voter coin to prevent tampering, would also be signed and sealed with the district coin.  This would ensure the specific votes are secured/hidden until the district coin is made public (The district coin is one use only for each election) allowing the decryption of the ballots available in the already public ballot chain.  The ballot validity is confirmed from the district at that point, and the ballot hash would be visible and confirmable at that point (the ballot was signed by a ballot coin that was issued to the district).  This method also allows everyone to see how many people have voted at a district, and also see how many people are left to vote. 
What we get with this:
* voter, ballot, and district coins are essentially wallets made for the purpose of voting (colored)
* voter coin - issued to voters that is logged with election officials, and can be swapped at any time, but tied to a voter in the election office only (private), could be stored in mobile wallet (like blockchain.info) or tied to physically issued coin, whatever form that "coin" may be.  The public would be able to see your coin and what it is registered to vote as, but has no tie to a person (even their firstbits as people would only see the initial receieving address for the wallet).  There could be even more information (if a person chooses) to tie to a voter coin, like demographics.  It would be nice if the coin itself could be used to lookup what demographics/info are tied to your vote coin, but still be unable to tie to a specific person
* ballot coin - issued to a voter at voting time with a valid voter coin
* district coin - used to secure and sign the specific votes until voting is complete, private key released to the public once voting complete, but votes still unchangable (one use wallet)
* one person, one vote, electronically/cryptographically secure and separated from the person (ie. anonymous to the public but confirmed vote), no way to tie a ballot to a specific person, only the district.
* all chains are public (should be integrated within main chain to ensure processing power of entire network is used to secure elections), forever and P2P distributed the same as bitcon is.  The voter chain is anonymous to who an address ties to, but can show immediately and confirm that a person has voted, immediate/public results on number people people registered and number of people voting in a ditrict/state/country/(world)
* people are registered/confirmed easily just like they are now at town hall (or something)
* voter coins firstbits are known, reusable, and can be confirmed at voting time by their name and address (like checks now), and can also be visible if they have been used or not, there is no other information tied to the cast ballots. There is no way to use a voter coin more than once in the same election
* people could register to vote on election day, and the vote could be tied (for that election cycle on a private network) to the ballot, and if the person does not confirm as a voter, then the ballot could be discarded, so would be considered a provisional ballot, and would be indicated as such in the public ballot chain
* voting can take place anywhere with simple equipment, even smart phones/devices 
* eliminates the need for vote recounting as all of the information is alreay available to everyone.  If there is a problem with the votes, it is an external force that would make no difference counting everything again as a distraction/time waster, and would actually help put more focus on actual election problems (severe district discrepencies)
 
If I missed anything, please let me know.  I am sure there is some changes that could increase/decrease privacy, but privacy is key when voting, as peoples lives could literally hang in the balance if they were tied to their vote

This was nothing more than a market correction of an inflated exchange rate that realistically should have been closer to $600-$700 based on historical performance.  The drop is also a liquidity issue that will continue to be resolved as the system expands
a crash would indicate something failed, was broken, etc.  Nothing happened to bitcoin itself, the exchange rate dropped from liquidity issues and panic sellers, nothing more, and is already correcting, just the same as the last 5+ corrections

Anybody could technically do what Cloudflare does with anycast (they did not setup any their datacenters, they made instructions and shipped them all the equipment).  All it would take is shipping a router to multiple data centers and setup anycast that would allow a company to spread the impact of an attack the same as Cloudflare does
Cloudflare may not be the best answer for this issue, but they could be a way to at least mitigate attacks until there is a better way for them to do (the DNS control alone at Cloudflare with near instant DNS changes is absolutely amazing and useful in mitigating an attack also)

no, that is a standard loan of something you already have.  FRB is lending out more than you actually have.  If you have 10 coins, and lend 1, you are left with 9 coins that you can lend.  If Alice pays you 1.2 coins, then you have 10.2 coins to loan, but until it is paid back, you still have 9 coins.  this is the way banking SHOULD work.
FRB is taking 1 (something), and loaning out 10, or 100, or 1000 at the same time telling everyone they all have the same value when in reality it has a FRACTION of the value, hence, fractional banking
You can not send a bitcoin to someone than still be able to use that same coin with another 10 people at the same time, it will never ever work like that, as much as you want it to, you can not spend more than you have

There is obviously much talk about bitcoin and virtual currencies in general at the government level finally, just need to make sure the fear and war mongers don't lead the conversation
Thanks for posting link!

Oh, yes, that is true, but I only meant split up the servers as directors that push specific amounts of orders to the main trading server.  That way an attack of flooding orders is limited to single/few incoming trading servers and also controlling/expecting the slow of the trades to the main server is never maxed out and only a smaller set of traders is affected rather than entire exchange going down
TL;DR split up servers as traffic cops directing inflow to single trading server

you mean the patience of the people that lost their life savings in the current financial system?  the people that did everything "right" are the ones that got screwed the most, how is that any different?
I am certainly not saying invest everything in bitcoin, but our current financial system is just as volatile and devastating, if not worse, as bitcoin may or may not be
but at least people can not create duplicate bitcoins out of thin air like out current financial system does (printing presses running full steam these days), that also has the wonderful effect on the people that do everything "right" and has patience as the savings they have becomes worth less and less every day in terms of its purchasing power

government has been getting in the way of progress for years, and only got worse once the terrorists accomplished their goals of us destroying ourselves from the inside out with the "war on terror" that only serves to destroy our rights and in reality makes the terrorism problem worst by killing people in other countries from afar, in turn making more people angry at us, and in turn creating more potential terrorists.  Just like the war on drugs, serious consequences to the short sighted enforcement/illegality

Sounded great, until I got to "The Bleak Future of Law Enforcement".  You sound like all of these problems are all of the sudden going to appear or get worse because of bitcoin (or whatever distributed currency comes about).  The problem is "illegal things" have always existed, and people have always found a way to get what they are looking for, illegal or not.  This is no different than cash, which is used every day for numerous illegal activities.  As for tor, an enourmous tool for freedom of speech is unfortunately used to transmit "illegal activity", the same as cash and/or bitcoin or any other medium of exchange is used for an "illegal activity".  Tor, the same as bitcoin, is just another tool, how people use the tools available to them says nothing about the tool, the tool did not choose to do something that was illegal.
Then you have the problem that things that are illegal some places are not illegal elsewhere and/or they should have never been made illegal to begin with, and just because you can use a bitcoin rather than cash really makes no difference, other than making it easier to transact. If a person was already prepared to do something illegal, they would have found something to do it with, cash or coin.  Then you potentially have the strange alternate side of that argument where having bitcoin instead of cash negates the robbing a person or place and/or putting people in danger of those robbery situations. 
Then you go with the "think of the children".   Cash, gold or bitcoin, unfortunately children will still be kidnapped for ransoms and/or other horrible things, the medium of exchange/extorsion makes no difference.  
What WILL be the biggest problem is wealth disparity, which ALREADY exists in a very severe form, even before bitcoin has made any noticeable impact.  Here's the flip to that, is that those with all the wealth a power currently horde said wealth, so we already have hording of currency with those at the top.  The effect of people "winning the lottery" with bitcoin will have the same effect as winning the actual lottery, many will blow most if not all of their new found wealth in the economy in one way or another, in turn circulating more money into the economy from the bottom, which will beneifit many more than the "trickle down" ever has.  You also have to remember that many people will use their new found wealth for donations or building a company that creates jobs which may have never been possible if it was not for bitcoin
The brief mention of all the sudden taxes stopping is silly also, there have always been taxes, and there will always be employers that are required to report your earnings to the government that still require your payment, bitcoin or not.  As for anything else that is "supposed" to be taxed, if people were trying to doge it, they can already do that with cash.  And the tax man will still notice if you are living beyond your means.
edit: ~~Going to go finish reading the rest of the post now...~~
OUCH.  you kept with the same false premise that everything in the world will all the sudden go bad for no reason other than greed, which has already done way more damage to MANY children, way more than 1 kidnapper ever will do.  There is not a terrorist or kidnapper around every corner, but they are out there, they will always exist, and there is nothing we can do to stop that.  What we CAN do is change how we HANDLE said situations.  
Then you went all scifi, as much as I love scifi, there is a reason it is almost impossible to get any type of gun legislation to pass, there still exists people that will die for their rights, and many, including myself, would never be part of some crazy one-world government that tracks every thought I have.  Many people do not value privacy these days, but then many people do, and as you mentioned, Tor, is used every day to help just that
There is yet another touchy subject, guns, and I for one am glad that many people own them, the same as countries with nuclear weapons, MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction, and people in America will not go down without a fight
The people should not fear their government, a government should fear it's people and what will happen if they try to rip everyone's rights away

I thank you for reaching out to everyone, I have been hitting your site occasionally today looking for an update.  As a server administrator myself, I have felt the growing pains of a large influx of users showing unexpected performance problems with the code with the new concurrency (and that is the real killer, once things start stacking up, it's all downhill from there)
Great to see the overall impact to the current exchange rate was not too bad (my co-worker thought it was comical to see the people freaking out like the world is ending knowing that in reality nothing bad was happening to bitcoin), and a lot of people today got to win big at the expense of the panicking short-sighted persons.  
This may look like a bad thing to some people, but this is absolutely needed if we are to ever know how stable things can and will be.  This starts to eliminate the "what if's", like "what will happen if mtgox goes down, will it take bitcoin with it"?
The answer is a solid absolutely not, and this makes the entire bitcoin community stronger in the long run
Keep up the good work and please keep the community updated with events as soon as you can, knowing there is a problem and it is being worked on can really calm the nerves (I know, it sure made the game players a lot happier about the laaaaagg  )
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:06:04
Simple, people that did not panic made a killing yesterday buying up coins from people that did, nobody said an unregulated market would be pretty (and many over and over again have warned of the risk)
But then again wouldn't high frequency trading negate this problem by making it much harder to do this to the market?

great news piece, great to see my donations put to great use, but I wish news orgs when mentioning the exchange rate soaring to 1200 then dropping to 750 (or whatever it may be) would begin with it was at 250 before soaring to 1200, makes a while hell of a difference
I say this because others that seen this piece or other news, knowing I am involved with bitcoin, point out it plummeted in value when in reality it was still significantly higher than where it started
I care less about the exchange rate, I am here for the technology, but unfortunately too many people only look at the price before looking any further, and if they hear something that gives the impression it lost half it's value somehow they will look no further

if the government decided to "stop bitcoin" it would do absolutely nothing to the other countries that have already gave it a green light and only server to cut of the US from the next technology that rivals banking like email rivaled postal mail and the internet rivaled newspapers.
The train has left the station and is full speed ahead, any attempts to stop it will only serve to reinforce and promote bitcoin the same way that attacking people for sharing a song has done nothing to stop file sharing and studies have shown it actually has the opposite effect
And don't get me started on the insane drug war that still continues despite being illegal for centuries
This is not optimism or pessimism, it is reality

regulation technically could never touch bitcoin, unless the legislate away the internet and everything it already runs upon every second of every day (SSL)
And if made illegal somehow, we can already see full well how that worked with prohibition and the war on drugs, but a technology that can be transmitted around the world instantly ever going away?  I think not, and going that route will increase the even eventually the value
By the time any type of serious regulation/crackdown comes about, Bitcoin will be well beyond the point of no return (can anyone say Streisand effect?)

a fractional system can only ever be built on top of bitcoin, and bitcoin itself can not ever become a fractional system, so you are not creating bitcoins, you are creating fiat currency (IOU) like the US used to have based on gold.
you can not create bitcoins, there is forever a fixed supply that can not be changed, and would be akin to taking a single bar of gold and giving multiple people that same bar of gold if they all requested it at the same time in the fractional system, you can not, it is impossible, and bitcoins are just as impossible to duplicate.
bottom line is whatever is created can not be directly traded as a bitcoin, and must be exchanged for a bitcoin, if the institution issuing the IOU's has bitcoins to cover the request for conversion.

Banks can do whatever they want, i care less, and I fully understand how they work probably more than most people
My point is again that bitcoin itself can not be double spent, there is nothing stopping a bank from doing the same thing they did with gold, have a currency based on something with value and limited resources/hard to duplicate then make a piece of paper that says it is the "same", when in reality it is not directly tied to it's original value anymore, then they remove the original value from the equation entirely and we are left with what we have now for a banking system
But even if that happens, bitcoins themselves are unaffected, and even better than gold in the respect that everyone forever knows how many coins will be in circulation and can be completely verified at any time by everyone
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:44:18
I have no issue, no offense meant, and no offense taken, just responding to text on a screen, nothing more, and if I came across as "elitist" that was certainly not my intention.  I have however been involved with bitcoin for years, fully understand every aspect of it, and have worked with open source and closed source software and provided numerous computer services for over 10 years, but sometimes my knowledge gets in the way of my people skills
I was trying to be light about how asking for details on why open source was bad you gave me your feelings about it and no real details (hyperbole)
I reply to many different posts, and bitcoin is a highly contentious subject for numerous reasons, unfortunately not many people are as receptive as you are to others comments, and there is many people here just to stir people up, but I digress...
As for the hashing aspect of bitcoin, hashing is a 1 way cryptographic function that makes it easy to verify a particular piece of information, but very difficult to duplicate/forge the hash (for more details see   But the hashing is only a piece of the bitcoin puzzle, hashing is used to not only ensure information in the blockchain is unmodified, but it is also used to build the block chain itself, and this is where the miners come in.  The miners perform hashing functions essentially guessing at what the next block hash will be based on the previous blocks hash (and other factors to keep the answer finding time to 10 minutes), and the result has to fit specific criteria in order to be valid.  Whoever comes up with the answer first in the winner, and their answer is added to the chain along with all of the transactions they include, and they are rewarded for all the work with the block reward and all the fees in the transactions they include, this all happens on the average of every 10 minutes, and is what moves transactions through the network.  Since the hashes are dependent on previous blocks, the longer/more blocks built on it (confirmations), the less chance of an invalid block, double spend, etc.  Every transaction that has happened since the beginning of the bitcoin network (genesis block) exists within the blockchain, and every transaction is verifiable from then till now, and forever.  This is one of the biggest strengths of the bitcoin network, every transaction forever verifiable.  Essentially the bitcoin network is nothing but very sophisticated math
I would encourage you to have a look at Satoshi's paper,  it gives great detail on how the network works, is a little technical, but is a short read

It is inevitable that our electricity usage as a society will increase, so we should not trust or like a new technology because it uses electricity?   We are increasingly becoming an online society with more and more people owning devices that connect to the internet for whatever reason, do we stop inventing because we are guaranteed to use more electricity?
Many inventions would require enormous amounts of energy even to function (realistic space travel), do we dismiss that technology too?  How about desalinization that uses/needs large amounts of power to create fresh water, do we stop developing that too?
I still am not following what you are trying to say exactly, if it is not importance than is it back to power usage as I already shows means nothing in terms of scale?  
And even to your increasing power usage, people do NOT have to run ANYTHING to have bitcoins, they can have online wallets or even offline/brain wallets that require no power usage

not at all, that would only mean that peoples deposits of coins could be loaned out, but the "bank" would have to have the coins first, if there is no deposits/coins, they can not loan anything out, 
this is NOT fractional reserve banking
@_date: 2013-08-28 14:26:07
Fractional reserve banking in bitcoin itself will never happen, can not happen, you can not "loan" a coin to multiple people, that is the basis of how bitcoin works, not being able to spend something already spent/loaned
This does not however stop any state from creating new paper to use in FRB that has it's value tied to bitcoin (or another virtual currency), and that is about the only way you will see FRB associated with bitcoin
@_date: 2013-03-09 15:06:21
If you like portability, [blockchain.info]( if you want local only but still usable, [satoshi/desktop/standard client]( if you want greatest security but not easliy usable/disconnected from the internet, then a paper wallet or a (printed) [brainwallet](
In all connected instances, be absolutely sure you set a secondary passphrase to prevent access to your coins even if your wallet(.dat) was stolen.  and be ABSOLUTELY sure you write down in a ultra safe place your secondary password (I have already learned a hard lesson in this one, but at least is the only way I have lost any coins).  
Besides stealing your wallet, you also risk sending to the wrong address.  Be sure to quadruple check if not more a sending address when sending coins before you click send. 
I personally use all of these methods, and blockchain.info has secondary auth itself besides secondary password (google authenticator/ubikey), be sure to use that also

just noticed this one, please explain to me how somebody could take a bar of gold, loan it to one person, then loan that same bar of gold to another person without anything else but that bar of gold

Their loss, your gain, and when you take over the company be sure to tell everyone below you to NEVER ignore an idea, no matter how big or small

I am about to start wireless broadband in area and accept bitcoin of course, my multi-gigabit backbones are getting lonely, but it's fun to see speedtest.net pegged at 99Mbit over wireless

I am starting a wireless internet business, from free to business 100 Mbit up to 50 miles.  I would use this to purchase the planned and required equipment now rather 6 months to a year from now.  Already approved for 350' tower too, can't wait to get that one going.  Planning on paying referrals and resellers in bitcoins (if they choose).  Of course accepting bitcoin for payment at 15% discount to start
always better to invest rather than spend on (useless) items

not sure if any do yet (never really investigated much), but only a matter of time until they do.  When bitcoin is more mainstream, people will want guarantees against one of this biggest pitfalls to a consumer, a malicious business (and as much as PayPal/CC companies screews merchants, this is essentially what they offer), and if there is a guarantee a business can offer due to an insurance they pay for, then more people would be more comfortable doing business with them, and encourage competition instead of the very one sided CC/PayPal/etc solutions we have now
as for 2-of-2, etc, nothing in bitcoin is mandatory, and also in that linked read is: 


so your WPS could be a printed copy only, while the wallet remains in another location/thumb drive/computer, which I for one can't wait till that is possible, as printed wallets are nice and all, but if someone manages to get a copy of the printed wallet, the coins are gone, and of course the coins can not be easily used with a paper wallet, where an online wallet with WPS can be used any time/easily and still be safe

Yes, same for me, i thought the title was messed up, i do not see the first character but i do see the second one from my android phone (reddit is fun app)

Merchants are not allowed to price differently per merchant rules, ie you can not let your customer see the fees they pay/penalize the customer with the fees for using cc
Of course there is ways around this (like shipping and handling, etc)

you are confusing 2 very different things.  Gold, the item that can not be duplicated and is what bitcoin is most like, and that can not be changed.  Accounts, numbers, paper currency, these are all things that someone says has a certain value, but in reality is not tied to the original item in any way, be it gold or bitcoin, which allows banks to lend out more than they actually have, a fractional reserve system based on perceived value.
Bitcoin, in of itself, the same as gold, can never be turned into a fractional system, it is impossible, it can not and will niot work like that, and is like trying to take a physical bar of gold and make 2 identical ones
that being said, you just made the point of how our economy did so great and the advantages of a fractional reserve system, it can allow business and the economy to grow while not being constrained to having all of the base value on hand, be that physical gold in hand or having the encryption keys to the wallet containing bitcoins
so very simple, if you are talking about loaning bitcoins, the only way it relates is like physically exchanging a bar of gold (or a slice of it) that is no longer available to exchange once loaned.  Anything built on TOP of that system can be a fractional reserve system that allows for the creation of "value" that is not directly tied to the original valuable item, but can be EXCHANGED for the original valuable item, gold or bitcoin

how, and how can you be certain?  could also say that pirate40 was certain it was not money, but...
