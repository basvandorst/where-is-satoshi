I mean, I'm just going off what some professors have said to me. I may be getting confused as I'm a biomedical engineering student so this stuff is not a huge part of my course. My minor stream has put me much more into the investment and IP side of engineering lol.

Yeah, I know. 
This is a huge problem we're facing. Currently, prime numbers of many digits (hundreds) are used in encryption. If quantum computing advances to where we think it can, those prime numbers are easy to find.

Trading makes money though. Holding is pure speculation.

Actually that is a good point. Regarding technological development, I feel AI is where the next largest change will occur. Tunnelling issues will sadly only be solved with material development...
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:02:32
Yeah this is valid point. 
To buy these cars, you need to know the right people.

It will happen eventually.

I mean, quantum computers are working currently. Give it times and they really will break out current encryption methods. 
Furthermore, Lovelace's ideas were developed before quantum physics even really existed. I'd like to think modern day physicists have more of an idea how quantum computers work than someone from the 19th century.

Yeah but I think you'll find most people don't give a shit about banks not getting it, especially if the offered price is right. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:07:30
I highly doubt that. The rate of technological development is exponentially increasing. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:26:52
Lol where did you find that stat? Traders who lose money don't trade for long. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:31:49
Yes, which is why, eventually, banks will buy up bitcoin and regulate its price. 
The same shit happens with stocks. This isn't much different.

-1000 degrees is impossible to start (just an fyi) 
Furthermore, quantum computes are great because of super-states, which allow for much faster computation. Another factor to realise is that even if quantum computing is not mainstream, it will still be used for research, which will involve decrypting blockchain like problems. 
Also, we have quantum computers. If they develop at the rate typical computers did, (think of the difference between processing power in the 80s compared to now) the power they provide and the decryption they enable, may become a problem sooner than we think.

My table is already sorted. Property is a sound investment! 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:41:31
Yeah it honestly might be. It's allowed me to buy my parents a new car and get my house renovated though so I'm very, very happy considering I bought in at 1200! :)

Yeah because people will trade bitcoin for food. Totally. 
Most people don't use bitcoin, and in the case where fiat becomes worthless, you can guarantee power will be an issue. 
No power, no bitcoins. No bitcoins, no bread. You starve.

"There's power" 
I'm specifically talking about where there isn't power.
