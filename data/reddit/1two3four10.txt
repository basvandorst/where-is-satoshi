You don't want to to that or you will lose a lot of money. If you really want to though, buy btc and send it to an exchange and sell of a tiny amount of ur btc for an alt coin then play around with that. At the least you gain experience before you actually risk a lot of money.

Have you tried revolut? Its an online banking system but they 100% should accept you when it comes to crypto currencies as they have their own little section for it within the app.

Im curious though. Why couldnt you use a normal account?

No, how much you recieve usually depends on the vendor, for example one vendor may sell his bitcoins at 2% more than current average but he only allows for transaction minimum of 150$ worth. Another vendor may be selling their bitcoin for 8% more but minimum is 50$ transaction. These are just examples. How much bitcoin you will get depends on where you buy. I personally do believe you paid a little more than what you should have but the current price is rising so it should even out.

Before buying check if its profitable and worth getting. I think if your only looking to use 100$ its better to hust directly buy bitcoins and hold them, especially as it seems to be rapidly rising in price at the moment (though you might be paying a little more due to those price rises)

Best ways are to use exchanges. I think some dont require ID. At localbitcoins.com and bitbargain some vendors mah not require ID and take bank transfers or paypal payments. The vendors usually have a rating and are all verified in terms of ID and such so its mostly safe. You can also compare how much they are selling their coins for and how much the price is at the momeny. After u go through payment steps the coins are sent into a wallet on the exchange and you can send it to your own wallet whatever that may be.
