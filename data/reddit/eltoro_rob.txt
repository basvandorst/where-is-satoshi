If you were able to conduct all of your business (rent, buying food, gas, clothing, etc.) in bitcoin, a currency operated by mathematical principals, the government's follies and currency manipulation would be irrelevant.  
Personally, I would much prefer to use and reply upon on a currency which a tiny minority of self-serving wealthy individuals do NOT control...  I'm not there yet, but part of the movement to give people the choice!

And broke a key off in a lock...  He's a special little guy, that's for sure!

Locks looks pretty cool to me; sure, you have to trust the company, but with any physical asset, you have to trust someone.  Their site is up, works  well; with the evolution of bitcoin, I think this service fills a market need.  And they are first to market with it!

You can Lock and Unlock at any time.  Locking requires 2 blockchain confirmations before it shows as 'available'.  Unlocking is essentially instant.

Thanks for commenting, however, if it is a 'standard transaction fee' why doesn't Coinapult charge it?  They make the same transactions on the back end....  I noticed the little extra fee on my first Bitreserve transaction also...

The idea of providing a store of value outside of their banking system against gold and USD for Colombia and Argentina seems like a brilliant idea.

I understand the initial marketing is a bit vague, but this is really happening. There has been a lot of negotiation and work with local people and artists, the details are being finalized and exact names and locations will follow when they are firmed up.
We all learned (again) a lesson this week; Best not to over-promise and under-deliver!  ;-)

Great list; good assembly here Blincoe

True, to transfer the value, you will need to Unlock.  But while Unlocking, you can specify any bitcoin address; yours, mine...

There are many great advantages to bitcoin; one of them is decentralized trust for sure.  However, participating in commerce and living with people still has an element of trust involved (after all, you have to trust Overstock to ship your purchase, right?).  The amount trust someone is willing to extend to a business or government varies like everything in life.
For many people, the idea of trusting an established company or service, like Coinapult and Locks, is more attractive and feels less risky than trusting a government 'subsidized' bank (thinking of March 2013 in Cyprus).
Bitreserve's service here is interesting; I prefer Coinapult's Locks because 1) it exists today and 2) they offer gold and silver, not just fiat.

Island of interest to be unveiled soon.  I like the second idea; I would buy!

Bitreserve claims a 0.45% fee, but in reality, they are MUCH more expensive compared to Coinapult!

I'm not sure I'm improving the list, but in the spirit of getting the games kicked-off:
Instant Replay: everyone gets to see and review the reality of what just happened or a close play.
Bitcoin analogy: the blockchain has every transaction; dig through it as you wish to see what really happened.
Add a more until the final whistle, r/bitcoin!

Just to clarify a bit, Locks are not transferable at all at the moment.  To transfer the value of a Lock, a User will need to Unlock.  However, you can Unlock to any bitcoin address so the value of a Lock (or partial Lock) can be transferred, but not the Lock itself.  Hopefully that clarifies...
