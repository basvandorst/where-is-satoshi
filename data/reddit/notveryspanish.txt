No, that would be violent aggression.

Someone who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the entity that invented Bitcoin.
Despite the extremely low chance that he *is*, there's only really one entity that knows for sure... and pretty much everyone believes we don't hear from him/them/it anymore.

For lightning, yes. You can't just make an offline "paper" wallet for lightning - not without getting a 3rd party to watch over it for you.
@_date: 2019-10-18 02:01:34
Um, because murder is unethical.
@_date: 2019-10-17 13:36:35


Uh yeah, the arrest magically deleted all copies globally.
@_date: 2019-10-12 03:36:58
True, when your funds are in danger, you just have to trust the 3rd party to let you know in a timely manner that they're in danger.
You'd also probably have to pay for such a service.

Looks like he's under some heavy artillery fire.
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:40:05


Agreed. People should avoid doing that.
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:53:13
Not really... without running a node your only other option is to trust someone else... which isn't even considered safe in the short term. However it depends on how much value you put into it, and your personal willingness to risk that amount.

I spent 15 BTC on a logo... I never even ended up using the logo. I sometimes wonder if that graphic designer was a hodler or not.
@_date: 2019-10-20 01:42:15
In contrast though, having dumb is pretty fun.
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:45:58
Well, yeah, as does anything of value.

Then how can you refer to them as 'innocent'?


It's not violence that's wrong, it's aggression.
Non-violent aggression is way more 'wrong' than violent defence.
@_date: 2019-10-10 03:56:30
'Supporting' criminals has long been viewed by the law as a criminal act in many circumstances.
Supporting unethical police makes you unethical in my opinion, and I wouldn't choose the word 'innocent' for unethical people.


I certainly hope you're not trying to claim non-bias yourself, with statements contradicting the notion that police and gov are destroying HK.
(I'm biased - Police and government are the ones destroying Hong Kong)
@_date: 2019-10-10 06:43:09


I'm all for not beating people for having an opinion, but shunning is absolutely justified.

Genuine question: What even *is* a "20% incline"?
Is it the equivalent of a (90 / 100 * 20) degree incline?
i.e. is a 20% incline the same as an 18° incline?
@_date: 2019-10-01 09:33:27


This is a parenthesis:


Here's another one:


@_date: 2019-09-06 12:46:07
Yeah I guess there are examples of both ways:
* two won
* two yen
* two euro
* two dollars
* two pesos
* two bitcoins
Like how I snuck that last one in there? :)

Yes, always do large cash transactions in clear view of civil forfeiture agents. Don't forget to come smelling like weed too, just in case they're not paying enough attention.

I get what you're saying about different world locations, however I'd probably put it more down to differing personality types.
These four words gave me chills down my spine:


...and not the good kind of chills.


I bet they would.

He's also squarely on *our* side (us 'core-tards' that is), when it comes to Bitcoin vs oppressive government, and over-regulated fiat.
@_date: 2019-09-06 12:31:40


I feel like it's normal English grammar, like 'sending two dollars'. People who say "I just sent two dollar" are always foreigners who haven't quite got a good grasp of English yet.

Not really sure what kind of things you're after, but I find hardware mesh networks really interesting, and would love to see them develop more to the point where it's practical to use as an alternative to the more common ISP hierarchy.
