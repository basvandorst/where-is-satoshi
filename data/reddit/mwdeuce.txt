Gold is valuable because people have said it's valuable.  Just like Bitcoin.  Everyone better fucking wise up to this, lest they get left behind.

So you've come to this thread specifically to piss on everyone's parade?  To spread fear and doubt, along with your expertise on speculative bubbles and what they look like framed in previously non-existent asset classes? What's your goal here?

This ....might be the best one I've seen yet.

Not much of a need for it as a currency anymore, many other alternative coins will fulfill that role perfectly.  It is now a store of value. Which is what's been said for about that last 6 months.  People don't go around passing precious gemstones or gold bricks across the counter asking for coffee and a bagel, right?

Even after a massive institutional pump and dump (if that even happens pre 30k btc) the price will continue to rise, if not BTC then other crypto. The underlying tech has limitless application.  I don't understand the mentality of people holding the coin and then rat fucking it at every turn.  If you aren't holding... then a) I feel sorry for you, and b) I feel sorry for you.

People keep saying this and it's really starting to drive me nuts.  Bitcoin isn't the only crypto folks.  There are a shitload of coins out there that will spend with low fees.  Litecoin and Vertcoin are perfect examples.  They've been stating this use case for years.  Bitcoin will be the behemoth store of value, alt coins will be the easily fungible, low transaction fee coins you use everyday. Do your research before you propagate the FUD.

lol, this guy

You're an idiot if you think average joe's and grandmas are the people causing such massive price action.  Big money is coming in, by informed investors who see the potential. I'm loving this price climb as people jump on the mothership before it really takes off, leaving plebs and naysayers behind to dig through the trash heaps for sustenance lol.

If by actual discussion you mean rat-fucking bitcoin core and r/bitcoin, then yes.  Pick a post at random, and I'll wager 8 times out of 10 it's some bch propaganda that throws btc and core and r/bitcoin under the bus.  I'd rather see memes and positivity than unbridled hatred and constant mudslinging.  I browse crytpo subs for fun/news, not to see a bunch of us vs them bs.  I'll agree, it's gotten worse on both sides as of late, but before this huge BCH pump/segwit2x drama, this sub rarely mentioned r/btc.  The same cannot be said for r/btc mentioning r/bitcoin.  Over there, it's a never-ending echo chamber about how shitty blockstream is and how BCH is the only coin that can save us, despite all the evidence that BCH and all those involved are basically the crytpo version of Enron.

Hard lesson to learn, hopefully it wasn't a large sum.

Arguably the most toxic sub on reddit

lol august 5th 2017, and he's already talking like a seasoned vet.  Funny how a few months in crytpo seem like a lifetime.

HODL til you're in your 50's, and don't tell her now.  Not to put a damper on things, but the probability of divorce for you guys is pretty high, going forward from mid 30's to late 50's/early 60's.  Just HODL and don't tell anyone.  Even if you don't get a divorce, that 200 btc, in all likelihood, is going to be worth over 50 million by the time you're even close to thinking about retirement.

wrote up an [excellent post]( a few weeks back discussing volumetric observations. Everything he stated has been pretty spot on.  I expect we're going to see a 250bn market cap, 5kish bitcoin, then a strong recovery mid/late Feb.  Plus when I pee'd this morning, it was in two streams, which is a bearish omen, as we all know.

Litecoin is the future, let's be honest.

Gooood lord the crypto subs are full of idiots.  Wowsers.

Last night I dreamt Vertcoin knelt, alone, on a mountain of shitcoin corpses, it's marketcap so vast as to blot out the sun.  In it's gargantuan hand it cradled a frail, dying Bitcoin, the poisoned dagger of b2x protruding from it's belly, blackened tendrils twined about its scintillating block-chains.  As it's pulsing light dimmed, with it's dying breath, it spake "..O.one last meme? For old time's sake?".  A tear rolled down Vert's cheek, tumbled to the earth, wobbling.  "..You must be bold, to hodl.."
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:13:28
Yes, 1 b2x and 1 btc

Pretty much the entirety of the Asian Crypto market uses litecoin to transfer wealth, as it's fast and cheap.  Get with the program.  Honestly, Litecoin is the most promising coin there is right now.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:35:23
Should've invested in Vertcoin, you'd be filthy rich already :D
Edit: It's definitely not too late!
