On a complete other note, I'd go with something like Brawker. You pay in bitcoin and an intermediary purchases the thing from the seller in FIAT. The seller gets FIAT. You pay bitcoin. You get the thing. The intermediary gets the bitcoin s/he wants. Everyone goes home happy.

I don't see why not. You'd simply have to put the payment-to-the-landlord information in the private ordering part and then confirm with the landlord that payment was made to release the bitcoin escrow.

I thought Bitcoin was a cryptocurrency. If it is pushed as a cost saving tool (for anyone but a merchant; lower fees with respect to merchant fees is a fair comparison) then there are going to be a lot of disappointed/disillusioned newbies and a fair bit of negative pushback.
The truth is it is simply a currency. Nothing inherent in it makes things cheaper to use bitcoin.

The reason being that your waiter isn't really interested in the crypto aspect of it. And chances are that so long as "it just works", he isn't particularly focused on the libertarian aspects of it all. He wants to simply use it as an end-user. This is its value it provides, a means of exchange.

Yeah, but the customers need a smart phone and net even if the merchants don't have it.
I'm a service provider who would love to accept BitCoin (and I do but on the "I believe you paid me and will check when I get home" system that has thus far not been abused). My problem is that I rarely have mobile internet. However, for me where my customers are in their homes and have their home internet, a SMS message would do just fine.
But in a 3rd world country without smart phones? Someone needs a smart phone to make the system work. Now if you could Bitcoin by SMS that would solve it altogether.

This is really more of a story of, "Why you should use the night drop."
At the banks that I bank with, so long as it is only occasionally and not a high dollar amount and not on a business account, if I stuff my cash+checks into an envelope with a deposit slip and toss that envelope into the night drop, it'll be counted as a counter deposit when the bank opens for business in the morning; free.
The best part? You can deposit coins in the night drop!

I have been a great fan of Nokia for many, many, many years. I - in my former life as a secondary school teacher - had a student come to the US from the Ukraine and he brought with him a Nokia smart phone which, for its time, was light years ahead of what was available in the US. I drooled over it, and when he went home for the holidays, he acted as my agent and purchased one for me.
In the US, my Nokia stood out as a rarity. Even with its default SMS "ding" sound, I knew that it was my phone and mine alone. However, on travels to Europe, I kept jumping and reaching for my phone because I kept hearing the "ding" everywhere (and I do mean *every*where: trains, busses, the bathroom, the airport, restaurants).
My impression is that Nokia is to Europe what Apple is to the US. It is the common one. And it certainly has earned it with its insanely long battery life and its ability to get a signal when nothing else can!
Which is all to say ... doing it means you'd have a market.

I've often tried to buy bitcoin via Mycelium trader (not just recently) and for smallish sub $100 amounts (anything larger and I wouldn't do an in-person with the high markup that comes with it; I do in person for quick small bitcoin amounts and usually as a teaching tool for a friend). I've never had one succeed.

But see, barter is when you don't use a currency at all. So doesn't that defeat the point of BitCoin?
@_date: 2012-01-21 20:28:32
I do and they likely try but it doesn't work {not in my geographic area, not in need of my services, etc.}. Given that I am a service business and not an internet one, I cannot have customers who aren't in my geographical area. I have yet to be paid in BitCoin and I've been accepting it for several months now. Same with CraigsList ads. I accept but people don't offer.
Though given that people are paying me directly, cash and checks are more convenient for my customers who don't already have a stash of BitCoin than BitCoin would be. I see the utility of BitCoin more for crossing currencies (say a person in the US buying something from someone in Kenya) than for staying within the same currency. Within the same currency there are many as-good-as-cash {cash, check, money order, cashier's check, etc.} options so why pick something with extra steps?

Your example is of US to US (even within the same bank). In that case, all Joe has to do is get Jake's Chase account number, walk in to his Chase branch and initiate a one-time intra-bank account transfer. It should be fee free. If it isn't, then Joe needs to demand to speak to a manager until it is fee free.
Let's say that Joe lives in the US and Jake lives in France, thus making this international and trickier. Joe needs to go to Chase and initiate a wire transfer to his Mt. Gox account (provided that he made one already). He can then buy $4000 worth of BitCoins that he can send to Jake's address. From there, let Jake deal with it.
The amount of time that it takes for Joe to get money into his Mt. Gox account should be well under the 3 day limit that you struck and Jake can then choose to cash out his BitCoins or keep them (as the price is going up and up and up).

I see what you are saying and my local area actually has a local currency that is even accepted at the co-op, so you can feed yourself on the local currency. However because BitCoin would compete with our local currency, it is likely to lose. The local currency has tradition, familiarity, and POS equipment behind it. BitCoin isn't POS ready just yet as its value keeps fluctuating and both the vendor and the customer need internet access {not everyone has data on their cell phone. I, for one, do not.} to conduct a transaction.

The local currency is on debit cards with magnetic stripes like gift cards or whatnot. It links to a local currency account. It is like a huge gift card for my town and can be used in many stores. In many ways, it is like getting a mall gift card rather than one to a specific store.
If you have a POS machine, you can accept payments in local currency and it will end up in your account so that you can swipe your card to use it. Cards and POS machines are either free or very, very cheap from the town council.

If something like that were implemented, that would be a huge step toward mainstream adoption.
I know plenty of regular folks who aren't even aware of what their bills are because they "set it and forget it" on autopay. Is this irresponsible? Yes. But it is what the people want.

I receive bitcoin as payment for various side-work services I offer (babysitting and dog sitting). While points 3, 5, and 6 are good selling points for *merchants*, and point 4 is mayyyyyyybe a reason a customer might want to use bitcoin, this post isn't really in touch with what a customer feels at transaction time.
As far as the customer is concerned, they get a paycheck and then spend the paycheck (point 2). They aren't really concerned with holding on to their FIAT and if they are wishing to invest with it, they do so through CDs or the stock market. If they are in the position of being a customer they want to spend the bitcoin not be told that in 10 years it might be worth more. That'll just confuse them.
As far as points 3 and 4 go, customers swipe their card and don't care what is going on inside the box. They really don't. Attempting to educate them will only confuse them. Confused customers just shut down and walk away. This is the opposite of what you want.
In terms of point 5, the transaction time is, as far as the customer is concerned, **instant** with their regular debit card. They swipe. They maybe input a signature or a PIN. They get their thing that they are swiping for. They walk out the door. Do they care that the money which, by the way has already been pulled from their bank account, is in limbo to the merchant for 3-5 days? Not one whit. They are busy playing with their new widget and the merchant hasn't even entered their mind.
So too, point 6. When a customer swipes a card the fee is eaten by the merchant. To the customer's experience there are no fees. Here is where pointing out that bitcoin has a fee that the customer has to pay will actually disincentivize the customer from using it. "Why pay for the privilege of paying? Nope!"


Aside from people who are both in the minority and also concerned about their identity/personal information/privacy/control of funds (whether this should be a minority of people or not is a totally other point and really *should not be conflated with bitcoin*), there is, at the moment, zero reason why Johnny Ass Scratcher would want to use bitcoin.
As a merchant, there are tons of reasons.
But unless paying by bitcoin is the only way for Johnny Ass Scratcher to get WidgetPhone 6s, thus forcing entry to the bitcoin world, there is no hook, no drive, no gotcha, no problem of Johnny's that bitcoin solves.
Now the remittance market, that one point 6 goes for. But the question you posed and attempted to answer was implying payment for items or services, and remittance isn't either of those.
