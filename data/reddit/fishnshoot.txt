lol.. believe me, I pay plenty of taxes. I don't intend to pay a penny more than absolutely required. But thanks for your useful tip! And, isn't a large part of the genesis of cryptocurrency to move away from "government embrace"? Curious perspective you got there..

Don't assume anyone knows what the heck they are talking about.. especially on TV, and especially here on reddit. Actually, I'd trust reddit 1000x more than TV. I saw some lady on CNBC today, talking out her a$$.. saying there's a fixed amount of US dollars in circulation (backed by gold), but they can keep cranking out unlimited amounts of bitcoin (backed by nothing).. WTF? It's like completely the opposite of what she said? Does she even understand terms like "inflation"? And how there is paper currency in Zimbabwe that says "Three Trillion Dollars" that can't even buy a cup of rice because the government just keeps printing more money. Some experts... &lt;facepalm&gt;

You know what you know.. I recognize UChicago, and respect the school, but this is a whole new thing. I saw some supposed "monetary expert" yesterday on TV, talking about a "real currency" needs to have scarcity and transferability/interchangeability (fungibility), AND.. how there's only a "fixed amount of US dollars" (backed by gold), versus an unlimited amount of bitcoin (backed by nothing).. Uhh... wrong. It's actually the complete opposite. There's only 21-million bitcoin, period. Versus the US govt that will print up mo'money whenever it sees fit. Anyways, realizing there are misinformed people everywhere. Ignore the people still insisting the world is flat.

Speaking of Coinbase fees.. you might consider minimizing coinbase fee PERCENTAGE, by buying the max for a particular fee. They are in $1 increments... so, for example:
$1 fee:  up to $200 (so $1 fee if you buy $10, or $200)
$2 fee:  $201-301
$3 fee:  $302-402
$4 fee:  $403-503
$5 fee:  $504-604
and so on... you get the idea..
$9 fee:  $908-1008
Of course.. this is if you are staying in coinbase.. not gdax

So, if I transfer BTC from my coinbase to GDAX, and then transfer out of GDAX, say, every month.. to either a hot or cold wallet, but keep it in BTC, there shouldn't be any fees? Also, since I didn't sell/exchange back to fiat, I shouldn't incur any capital gains/losses, right? Since apparently, so far, the IRS is considering crypto an "asset". And, so long as I'm not one of the high-end buyer/sellers, I might not fall under the Coinbase reporting rules? Is that right? Thanks..

Of course.. but I'm talking about assets accumulated over my life, like savings, which I've already paid taxes upon when EARNED... but, when I die, I'd like to minimize the HUMONGOUS chunk the government will try to take in estate tax when my assets pass down to my kids. That's my point. Or maybe to put it another way, .. How is this different than, say, converting cash to gold bars or coins or whatever, and keeping it in a safe, and passing it along to children later?

but who got the better deal? I'd say the merchant...
that's the problem with something so wildly deflationary and volatile as bitcoin... why would I spend it? I'd gladly receive it.. and I'd give a discount also! In fact, I'm cleaning out my garage, and will surely be selling some stuff. I'll probably offer to sell stuff even cheaper if they pay me in BTC or LTC.

Partial bitcoins aren't worth hodl'ng... just send them to me and I'll dispose of them properly.   ;)
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:42:02
so you can send bitcoin to others, or to your offline or desktop or mobile wallet, via GDax? Sorry if this has already been asked/answered.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:40:20
if you want to promote bitcoin by using/spending, feel free to send a few satoshi my way... thank you..
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:23:27
Gotcha.. that's what I thought you were getting at... I'm already putting those plans in place.. I hope! Also looking at secure encrypted emails. THanks...

they're both the same platform, but different user interface and features. If you have an account on coinbase, you also have an account on gdax. You can't do limit orders on coinbase, but you can do recurring buys on coinbase. And, as mentioned at length, the fees are different. Supposedly, GDAX is for the "more knowledgeable" investor.. but not really. It's the same as any stock trading screen, like etrade, fidelity, whatever. Hope that helps.

sorry.. not catching your meaning here. What "news"? If you maintain your wallet and keys, the BTC should remain forever, right? Theoretically, I could pass a wallet on to my kids, or my kid's kids.. and so on... no???
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:42:02
..so long as the government doesn't take a huge tax-bite out of my crypto-a$$ when I die!!
