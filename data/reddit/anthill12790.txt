We also offer $50 cash deposit at our property. Works for guests that have cards we don't accept or cards that decline.

You have to realize this is going through 2 3rd party sources. Here is the line You&gt;Coinbase&gt;Expedia&gt;Me. If you have an issue with your reservation at my hotel I will tell you to talk to expedia. They will give you the runaround because you used coinbase. You will probably have to talk to 4 people and then still have issues. Idk how coinbase works but its still more of a headache then it is worth. So be careful with it.

except its expedia... If it were a branded hotel that would be fine but these guys are terrible to work with.

This just means that I am going to have to tell even more guests that they are fucked because I don't have control over their reservations. Oh you booked for tomorrow and you used bitcoin? I cant change it to tonight because its expedia. You have to call them and they will probably tell you to fuck off as you didn't pay with a card. So you can either be out on the street or pay my full price with your card. Have fun.
Edit: we need more of us to continue this hotel worker train!!!

As a hotel employee this pisses me off to no end. Expedia is nothing but headaches.

You just have to remember that Expedia can be very difficult to work with and that us at the hotel have no control over changing dates or canceling your reservations. 90% of things concerning your room have to be done through them. You are also paying more than you would by calling us directly because we get 75% of whatever you pay. If you call directly saying you saw a room for x amount we would probably give it to you for 80-90% of what you would have paid so that you save and we profit. It also saves us the headache of telling you I am sorry but because you booked with expedia we are unable to fulfill that request.

I should gild you for this but I don't have any money to gild with.

you have to remember though that expedia also has other booking sites that they control. So even though it seems like they are  the traffic on those other ones could bring them up to  I am sure pricline has another site as well but yeah.
