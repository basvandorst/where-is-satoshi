Try to click on the "Trade" link at the bottom of the main page (under "Quick Links") to get to a dedicated login page. You should be able to login from there.

Actually it's a troll fail: listing BTC on the _last_ position of the _least_ valued currency units with a value of 1 USD = 0 BTC means it would really have infinite value ;)

I'll reply to your mail regarding details.

The Mt. Gox password was randomly generated and stored in an offline password manager. The password to unlock the password manager however has similar strength and I remember it by using a combination of private phrases and random symbol sequences that I learned by heart.

Yes, I'm using 100% solar power for my rigs. Mining Bitcoins pays better than selling the electricity over the grid.

jesset77 already gave a very good answer, but Bitcoin offers yet another type of "escrow", which can be used additionally or instead of third-party multisignature escrow:
Prior to a purchase in Bitcoin, both parties can agree to "lock" a certain amount of Bitcoins by creating a transaction that sends this amount to themselves but requires the other party as a second signature. This gives both parties an additional incentive to cooperate on finding a mutual agreement over the deal. By choosing the locked amounts according to the relative reputation or trust of the two parties, the risk can be arbitrarily split, without requiring the overhead (cost) of involving a third party.
A reputable merchant might therefore allow anonymous purchases only from customers willing to lock a certain amount before the deal, whereas a new merchant might be willing to lock some Bitcoins itself in order to gain trust from potential customers.

That is correct, building such an array is a longer term investment but we have rather high electricity rates here which makes PV rather competitive in good locations. I don't deny that wanting to generate clean power and being kind of independent influenced the decision but nevertheless, the calculation is sound and the total profit over the lifetime of the array is definitely positive.

Sure. Location: southern Austrian alps, 15kWp solar arry feeding the GPU rigs. Currently I only get about 20kWh per day (winter &amp; cloudy), but on a good summer day it is over 100kWh, adding up to about 16MWh per year. Until the reward halving I was mining 24/7, using electricity from the grid in the night but since then I'm only mining with what I get from the sun, as the grid prices are not competitive anymore here in .at.

Exactly, but thanks to Bitcoin's [unique features]( these *banks* need not have control over your money. Transaction replacement will enable instant peer-to-peer payments between any pair of business partners outside of the blockchain, while providing the same level of security! With a single (e.g. monthly) settlement transaction in the blockchain for everyone you sent or received payments to/from, you can have as many secure transactions outside the blockchain as you want. By having intermediary payment services (which need not be trusted at all) you can essentially perform all your financial transactions with only a single settlement blockchain-transaction per month! This will not only solve the fee problem, but also the blocksize limitation and the growing size of the blockchain. The way we are using the Bitcoin protocol right now is like a sportscar locked in first gear - expect much more to come!

Just bought a little [quadcopter]( from a local store that started to accept Bitcoin. Great fun!

Unless people publish their private key or sign a message on demand, there is no such thing as proof of bitcoin wallet ownership. Having a BTC address in your sig might hint towards you owning it but it does by no means *prove* it. Also: it is easy to plausibly lose (sole) knowledge of a private key with time.

Same here: I also got a password reset email and now my old password does not work anymore. Mt. Gox support replied quickly and barring any major problem at their end the funds should be safe thanks to my Yubikey. I'm pretty confident that neither my client machine nor my mailserver was compromised but you can only ever be so sure so I'll reinstall both. My password was unique to Mt. Gox and has about 200 bits of entropy. It really seems this was a coordinated attack on many accounts.

Exactly, Bitcoin proves many commonly held beliefs and widespread economic theories wrong. The quote at hand simply points this out and is not meant to serve as a philosophical argument for the theory-practice dichotomy.

I think your best option would be to exchange it to EUR first because there's not that many people around here with an immediate need for USD cash. After that you will have no problem doing the exchange via localbitcoins.com (you'll find me there as well).
As for participation/promotion:
I can tell you that there's quite a lively Bitcoin scene in Austria/Vienna. We have regular meetings, workshops, presentations a weekly podcast, etc. Just today I got interviewed by one of our public broadcasting radio stations about Bitcoin.
Also there's going to be quite some preparation work to be done for the European Bitcoin conference 2013, which will also be here in Vienna. We are in touch with many different groups, from artists to banks and try our best to bring Bitcoin to the people. There's plenty to do and we're more than happy to get new people involved!
