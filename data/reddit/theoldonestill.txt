Just to add to this story: A friend of mine got a new cell phone with the purposes of using it for bitcoin purposes only. Never ended up using it, with one exception, he put the phone number on his MT. Gox account application( which he has never used) about 6 months ago.  That is the only time he ever gave out the phone number to anyone. Last week, he got a call from some stranger in Japan asking if he wanted to buy Bitcoins. You draw your own conclusions!

The Short Selling theories presented here are quite simply wrong. Having spent 40 years on Wall St., Short selling does not happen simply out of thin air. 
  To begin with, Mt. Gox  as the Exchange would have to allow Short selling through their Exchange ( and I am not aware that they do). Next, as the Short Seller you would have to borrow the Bitcoins from somebody in order to Short Sell them to begin with.( how many people do you personally know that will lend you $2 million worth of Bitcoins?)
 Since this is a totally unregulated Market, your cash/margin requirement to, for example, Short sell 2 million dollars worth would be a minimum of $4 million if not higher (in fact, probably a great deal higher)(as would be demanded by either the Exchange or the person you borrowed the Bitcoins from). Finally, what is the purpose of your Short Sale....hopes that the price will drop in half and therefore you'll make $1 million profit when you buy your Short back at a cheaper price.....So, you're going to Risk $4 million to make a million....man, you'd better be damn sure about your bet!!

It seems to me that, maybe, the real Satoshi should come forward now on Reddit (anonymously of course) and tell us a story (maybe something about the early development of Bitcoin) that only he would know and could be verified by the co-developers.....then maybe the media would leave Dorian alone.
