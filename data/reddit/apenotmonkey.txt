Well there is a massive effort underway right now to bruteforce through every possible output of sha256. I'll let you know for sure once its done but until then I guess we just have to cross our fingers.

Very easy. SEPA transfers are quick, it said I should wait 2 - 3 days but I waited about 6 hours (and that is mainly because I transferred at 2AM). Once you place an order, if it is near the top of the stack, I'd say it will take seconds or a few minutes at the most to get your coins.

Isn't there a two factor authentication scheme to avoid that situation? I think I read about a protocol like that on the Bitcoin wiki for paper wallets (and those physical coins from cascius or whatever).

Tungsten can be laser etched quite successfully though and that way you can etch a QR code. Ideally you would want some degree of obfuscation on the etched information, known only to the holder (either manual or automated obfuscation).

I wasn't saying it was feasible at the current time at all. When using the word "bothered" I wasn't literally meaning nobody had got off the couch to bruteforce the entire range of sha256 outputs for fun. I was sarcasticly implying the silliness that of course we can't know for sure but that doesn't mean we should assume the opposite (some of which, you have iterated).
 One day it will be feasible, right now it isn't. That is the nature of all encryption algorithms with Moore's law and the probability of other breakthroughs over time.


I didn't dismiss the issue in whole, I just think the odds of this being a problem with bitcoin are infeasibly small, just as you think the odds of a quantum or parallel computing effort brute forcing through sha256 sometime in the future are infeasible.
Lets say SHA256 didn't actually have 2^256 outputs, instead it had 2^254. Well that doesn't necessarily mean this is an issue as outlined by the OP. What are the odds all possible combinations required to solve a block are all hidden in that black hole in the search space?

They are just being lazy and using the last redirect they had to shut the site down and it happens to be the one they used when they moved servers.
According to [the twitter account]( it is a database issue.

Why didn't you Bing "bitcoin forum" if they have a better background image?

SHA256 can and will output every possible 256bit value (and collissions), if you feed it the right series of input. It is an nP problem, so it is unknown how long it would take to prove computationally, however, there are mathematical proofs and applications of the idea that lead one to believe the principle isn't likely to break.
In the very worst case scenario, that every possible input must be exhausted before the right hash is found, then you wouldn't need to go through every possible combination of 2^256 outputs, because the last number doesn't have to be a 0. Although the worst case scenario is possible, it isn't probable.
 The principle of information entropy in cryptography is fairly sound.

No. The moving servers message is just a redirect they use to shut the site down. I have seen it before, it was once used to move servers but now it is used because they haven't got round to making their own 'fail whale'.
According to the [twitter account]( it is a database issue:

Right but that doesn't count because that price comes from 2 conversions, 1 from BTC to SEK and then from SEK to USD. So fluctuations in the USD =&gt; SEK exchange are as much an influence over the $33 price as the SEK =&gt; BTC one. You can't use that as an indicator or to determine the buying power of BTC without  weighting it against the buying power of the SEK vs USD.

Yeah They are going to have their hands full with scaling up. Lets hope they get the hang of it before the downtime and cascading server fails make people move on.

Isn't it more like the MPAA/RIAA not allowing Napster or Kazaa or Limewire, since bittorrent was a response to failures of original file sharing apps and the first generation p2p file sharing apps that invented the concept.
As I recall, napster was sued to legitimacy and became irrelevant under new ownership and so was kazaa. Limewire is shutdown too, the software cannot be distributed any longer by court order.

Pardon? What is clueless about that? (and didn't you just offer an opinion as fact)
The only way to actually prove every 256^2 combination would be possible with SHA256 is to actually bruteforce through all combinations and compare them. There are loads of rainbow table efforts out there, lots of things like cache nets with billions of objects indexed with sha256 hashes but none of those single operations (operation here meaning entity or organisation) have ever brute forced through all possible combinations. But out of all those organisations, none of them has found a problem with entropy in sha256 OR an efficient way to generate collissions with a birthday attack.
So until that organisation with enough resources manages to build a big data center in Utah and brute force through the entire space and manage to compare every output was indeed achieved, we can't know for sure, but seeing as most major big name cryptographers of our time have tried to break these algorithms and one of the weaknesses they target is entropy and they have had no success thus far, I would apply Occams razor.
@_date: 2013-02-26 03:32:23
It is unproven because nobody has ever bothered to bruteforce the entire space under a single operation (yet?), but if you look at number of sha (or a few other one way digests) hashes that have ever been computed, this principle has never been shown to not occurr either.
There are mathematical proofs for all widely accepted algorithms however, to show there output is distributed randomly (as possible). That is part of peer review.
If you apply Occams Razor, I see no reason to assume that sha256 can only produce 2^255 outputs.
@_date: 2013-02-26 22:37:35
Aren't you just trolling though? If you have an understanding on sha256 entropy that I don't, I'd love to hear it.

Based on the price going up the way it has overnight. This is what happens when people pump-and-dump in a small currency market. Buy the price up, then speculators get excitied and buy the price up further dreaming of the next day of &gt; 10% rises and then dump the stock once margins have been achieved and then the market takes a large slide downwards as nervous speculators ditch the currency realizing the sure thing was only sure for the person with first mover advantage and enough money to make it worth while.
Obviously neither you can I can be certain either way, only time will tell but you can't call the guy crazy for thinking the market is being manipulated. Even tomato markets are manipulated and every commodoty market I can think of is manipulated, so I would say chances are high that a market for a currency that has attracted more speculators from all walks of life is being manipulated with people buying prices up and down to make a profit.
If little old me has trading bots taking advantage of positive and negative movements then you can bet your sweet ass people with more time, skill, intent and money are playing the game on this field, if not before, then definately now that we have had more than 100% increase inside of 3.5 weeks.
