Wow, I've never heard anyone claim that bitcoins have inherent value like gold, and I've been in the bitcoin game for some time. 
The mere act of electrons moving and computers computing to make an electronic currency does not in itself bestow intrinsic value to said electronic currency. If your argument were true, then the Federal Reserve Dollar would have intrinsic value by virtue of the paper and ink needed to print them.

True, and they cant stop BCs existing and moving around, but they can make it very hard to convert it to other currencies. 


Gold was banned for private use (except jewelry) in the USA between 1934 and the 1970s. They could do it again. And they already prosecuted that Liberty Dollar guy.

 &gt; The proof of burden is on your "genius" to support his claims, not on me to refute them.
I supported my claim when I said: "Vote for me, and I'll give you stuff!" = bribery. What I did was show that politicians promise gifts in the form of resources and services and attention, in exchange for votes, and that meets the definition of bribery.
Your assertions, while not disputed factually, were pointed out by me to be wholly irrelevant to the question of whether or not voting = bribery. You offered nothing but a red herring; a distraction.


This is also irrelevant to the question as to whether or not voting = bribery.


Hmm, let's see. Democratically elected representatives in the Greek government are exchanging their votes of austerity for a promise by the EU to be bailed out by taxpayer dollars. That's not bribery? Meanwhile, the Greek public are screaming for blood as they feel that they have been sold out and used as bargaining chips. 
Nope, no bribery here. More along, citizen.
@_date: 2011-06-20 01:04:14
Actually TradeHill and MtGox are talking about creating some kind of multi-party security task force or something, in the hopes of preventing this kind of thing from happening to any exchange. I like the decentralized, collaborative atmosphere that BitCoin has. I don't think anyone, even MtGox's competitors, want to see any exchange take a huge security hit and cause a flash crash.

An update from their site:
[Update - 2:06 GMT] What we know and what is being done.
It appears that someone who performs audits on our system and had read-only access to our database had their computer compromised. This allowed for someone to pull our database. The site was not compromised with a SQL injection as many are reporting, so in effect the site was not hacked.
Two months ago we migrated from MD5 hashing to freeBSD MD5 salted hashing. The unsalted user accounts in the wild are ones that haven't been accessed in over 2 months and are considered idle. Once we are back up we will have implemented SHA-512 multi-iteration salted hashing and all users will be required to update to a new strong password.
We have been working with Google to ensure any gmail accounts associated with Mt.Gox user accounts have been locked and need to be reverified. 
Mt.Gox will continue to be offline as we continue our investigation, at this time we are pushing it to 8:00am GMT. 
When Mt.Gox comes back online, we will be putting all users through a new security measure to authenticate the users. This will be a mix of matching the last IP address that accessed the account, verifying their email address, account name and old password. Users will then be prompted to enter in a new strong password.
Once Mt.Gox is back online,  trades  218869~222470 will be reverted.

Not a bad spreadsheet. I've found that the Mhash on my 6970 is higher than what is listed in the bitcoin wiki. My 6970 in windows, overclocked to 950mhz, gets 412Mhash/sec.
I would generally recommend getting a 69XX series card, because even though its a bit more than a 58XX series, it is way easier to find. 58XX cards are rare as hell right now.
@_date: 2011-06-21 21:06:07


Correct, the USA.


Unsatisfied is an understatement, but yes.


I am an anarchist, which means that I deny the legitimacy of government in all its forms and no matter its budget surplus or deficit. I, unlike you, I do not believe that democracy makes government accountable to "the public" in the first place, so to answer your question directly: No, I do not think a government would do a "better job" if it were, in your words, "not held accountable by the public," aka non-democratic.


When it comes to subsidies paid for by taxes, and doled out for votes, yes I consider it all bribery.


Ah, perhaps I should clarify. What I consider bribery, in this instance, is not whether Greek politicians *reduce* or *not reduce* their spending, but the entire institution and process of democracy exercised by a political body that is clearly hated by -and has no legitimacy afforded to it by- the people it claims to rule. It is the principles of the methodology and mechanics of this system that inherently possess these immoral, corrupting traits. Whether they reduce or increase spending is immaterial. They should not exist in the first place. 
And I should also add that anarchy is quite a popular ideology in Greece, especially among the youth. So while my views may seem alien, alarming, or fringe in your eyes, these views are quite popular among the citizens of the very country our debate is about.

If you have 0 connections, you won't get the bitcoins to appear. You need connections. 
it might help for you to open up a port on your router. I believe it is 8333 or 8332. Forward that port to the ip address your bitcoin client is at. That should give you more connections to other clients and allow you do download the blocks and get the BTC to show up in your wallet.
@_date: 2011-06-15 15:30:02
In future instances, I recommend using totally separate and unrelated passwords for each account. For example, I use KeePass to manage my passwords, and also to generate PWs that are very difficult to crack and totally unique for every account I have. 
KeePass has done wonders for me. I think a program like that will greatly help you avoid any more problems like this in the future, or at least limit the hack to one account.

The specificity or generality of a claim is irrelevant to whether or not it needs evidence. You submitted a claim without evidence and I replied with a counter claim that was also unsupported with evidence.

They are private roads and toll roads. A famous example is Route 91 in Orange County. There are thousands of them all over the world. They are  less congested and better maintained thanks in part to a superior pay-per-use funding/revenue method.


Renewable energy is generated by privately made (and usually privately operated) solar and wind farms. Decentralization of electricity production via solar and wind devices on small private lots (thousands in my area are alone installing solar panels on their roofs) is clearly not funded by government, and saves the operator a ton of electricity costs in the long run. Oftentimes they generate so much extra juice that they pump it back into the grid and get a deduction on their bill.

Everyone already mentioned no central authority. But it should also be said that egold was backed by gold: gold that you did not physically get to possess. Bitcon isnt like that. 
Gold not in your hand is gold that is more easily confiscated from you. Bitcoin can only be confiscated from you if you are careless with your wallet file. In other words, unlike egold, you hold your bitcoins in your hands.

Most bitcoin merchants are not brick and mortar. But even if they were, the government would still be largely powerless to stop it.
Let me explain how a Frenchman can so easily demonstrate the unenforcability of this stupid law:
Frenchman signs online via the TOR network. Finds local vendor selling a widget. This particular vendor is brick and mortar but could easily be online only. Frenchman sends bitcoins to the vendor's bitcoin address, and the vendor instructs the Frenchman to come by the shop to pick up the widget. Frenchman picks up widget, goes home happy. 
Now this brick and mortar shop does not report this sale to the government. This shop does not pay taxes on the sale. The government doesn't know the transaction happened, and the government doesn't know that the shop trades in bitcoins.  Voila! Successful black market at work.
Hell, I do black market work all the time in my country, using my country's official currency no less. My government never catches me. How will a government magically catch a business that trades even more underground, in the bitcoin world, and advertizes in the darknet? Get real.

Bitcoin is only divisible to eight decimal places. That seems like a hell of a lot now. But theoretically, if the value kept going up forever, we could eventually run into that wall.
