I think he meant that the GPU makers can easily produce more product than any ASIC miner, which we know is true.

1. To use bitcoin ATM one must provide more identity information than toa  bank. Even certain exchanges need this. Unless you want to meet sketchy people in parking lots to trade bitcoins for cash you will give more info than usual here.
2. The average Joe computer user is the one who clicks on spam ads in their browser. They are not going to know how to even attempt to encrypt a file.
3.You can send and receive bitcoins but is limited to internet access and having power to run it. Good luck for the villages that are one mudslide or earthquake away from being in total darkness. Or even India's counties that can have sporadic blackouts.
4. Funds have already been auctioned by the US Marshals. Can't be confiscated my ass.
5. There are fees. Without fees people wait hours if not days for their transfer to complete. Even moving money between exchanges runs into more fees than a bank.
6. Unless you get your account stolen which the average Joe suffers quite often then your bitcoins are gone.
7. Anyone who has access to an open internet and power. See point 3.

I've read other people are not getting paid or able to cash out. They might be out of funds, ran off with all the funds, or just left the site for a while.

No. Buy constantly lowering your average in an investment you stand to at least sell earlier than if you have only your current value at hand. By investing in bitcoin you centralize your certainty of failure.
