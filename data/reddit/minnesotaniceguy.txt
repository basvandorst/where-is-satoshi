Doesn't bitcoin have an issue with high transaction volume though?  I thought I remember reading that there was a sort of hard cap as to how many transactions the block chain can handle per block.

One person that I knew that I was able to accept Bitcoin as a currency said when I told him that [5 qualities of currency]( that that was really helpful in understanding how Bitcoin has value.
Another thing I always come to in understanding Bitcoin is making the analogy with gold in how it stores value like gold.  How gold really doesn't have the intrinsic value that people think it does.  I saw some economic explanation of how if gold wasn't used for a store of wealth, that it would only really have a value of 10-20$ per ounce based on its functional uses.

@_date: 2014-03-13 17:26:34
Its nice.  For the argument, say you can get 1.5% interest for a bank, and inflation is .5%.  That .5% is nice, but no nicer than another .5% savings or any other investment.
Have you heard of TIPS?  Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.  They are guaranteed by the Federal Govt. available to individual investors, and they attempt to give some very small interest rate plus the rate of inflation.  Nothing is perfect, and some people have some qualms with how they calculate inflation rates, but they seem to do about what they are supposed to.

where can you sell 3,000 coins without slippage?  Its possible, but i would bet on below market.  With anything else, introducing more supply generally reduces price, and adding 30k coins to the market would be seen as flooding the market.
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:51:31
Yeah, but they don't have to declare it as income until they sell it.  
A gold miner mines 1 million dollars worth of gold, sits on it until 2050 and gold is suddenly worth 10 million dollars when they sell it in 2050, they don't have a taxable event until 2050, although they can write off losses today for their overhead.

One thing about trying to sell that many coins in the market is that it would severely pressure the price of bitcoin down.  So it allows him to sell all of his coins or a large stake without all of the slippage.

I kept thinking about this, not understanding why you were so opposed to gyft, and I guess I didn't explain it well at all, but gyft is an online store that sells "gift cards", but they're actually digital gift cards, so you don't have to actually wait for them to send it to you, you can get a gyft gift card, then seconds later buy from Amazon with it, you can also load the app on your phone, so like at Target they just scan a code that is brought up on a screen on your phone.

I don't think anyone believes that Bitoin is going to completely displace the dollar.  Someone can be totally Keynesian, and think owning an asset that is deflationary is valuable and has a strong future.
An analogy:
Imagine a film snob.  To him, film is the only correct way to watch a movie, from a projector on to a screen, digital is abhorrent.  He also sees that Netflix is the future, and an investment it it is a better return.  Would the guy investing in Netflix belie his beliefs?  I don't think so.

Usually when you open a brokerage account, usually in the small print there is essentially a clause allowing them to lend out your shares.  In some cases you can specifically agree that they are not allowed to do this with your shares, or you can negotiate an interest rate that they must pay you in order to borrow your shares.  There are a few stocks that have a pretty high cost to borrow.  Not sure if its stil true, but iirc there are two classes of Chipotle stock.  One has voting rights, one doesn't and the one without the voting rights has a very small percentage of total outstanding shares compared to the normal shares.  In theory the shares without voting rights should be valued lower, but they keep a premium to the voting rights shares.  Seems like a stock ripe for shorting, but no one is willing to lend the shares for someone to short them without an exceedingly large interest premium, and people want to keep holding the stock because they manage to get a good interest premium for owning the stock and lending it out.
Your statement about legitimate shorting not being able to happen on the block chain isn't right.  Essentially, all I have to do to short a coin is find someone willing to lend one to me at a suitable compensation to them with agreed upon paramaters and then sell it (on the blockchain).  My counter party has risk in having to trust that I can repay them a Bitcoin at some later agreed upon date or event.
Another interesting effect of shorts in a market is a "short squeeze".  A stock with a high short interest can really cause prices to explode upwards.  Say someone decides to short a stock.  A brokerage will extend them margin credit.  For simplicity's sake assume they short 1 stock at $100.  Imagine the brokerage extends them $5 in credit.  If the stock goes down, they make money, if the stock goes up the shorter loses money.  Then brokerage isn't willing to take unlimited risk for this guy five bucks is what they feel comfortable with.  Say the next day, the stock opens up at $105, the shorter will get a phone call from his broker saying basically, "We want our money, you can immediately send us cash so you remain within your your credit limits or we will buy back the stock.  If the guy has to buy back the stock, in a market this causes buying pressure which causes the price to rise which causes more people to have margin calls, which causes more buying pressure.

A lot of the people talking about the doge inflation I feel like they don't understand how small it is.  Its about 4 percent after the first few years, and it slowly decays.  It solves a problem of what makes keeping the network secure after all of the coins have been mined worthwhile.  Who is going to "mine" after bitcon stops giving out block rewards at all?  
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:54:14
Well, there are three things that could have happened, the coins were sold off market at above, at or below the current market price.  My guess would be below.  Its all economics, but I believe people short term are worried that this amount could be dumped on the exchange, but at best it just increases the short term supply of coins.

The argument against a deflationary currency is that they wouldn't spend it.  People would be pressured to not spend it.  'I could go out with my money and buy a Ferrari, but if I wait til next year, I can get a Ferrari and a Porsche with the same money."  It also has the same effect on the economy.  People stop spending, borrowing money becomes more expensive and risks become more expensive.  At a certain point, in an economy with a deflationary currency Holding your money and not doing anything with it is the best investment.

Yeah, seems pretty spot on with what I was telling a friend of mine yesterday.  I think its going to steadily trend downwards a couple percent per week, until something big happens, and its going to go parabolic and getting in is going to be hard.  I remember in November when BTC was hitting new highs every day, and everyone wanted to get in the market, but they couldn't fund accounts fast enough, people were having to wait 4 days to get accounts funded and kicking themselves about it.
@_date: 2014-04-04 06:18:50
My fear is: Everyone knows Paypal hates Bitcoin; what if they are intentionally introducing this with the intention of not facilitating or backing transaction at all.  There are easy enough ways for them to guarantee transactions of crypto coin transfers, but if its their plan to destroy Bitcoin all they have to do is allow scammers to easily operate and operate the Bitcoin operation in a Laissez-faire manner.  If enough people have negative experiences with cryptocurrencies, they can really destroy the economy, especially considering that its Ebay, where a lot of people might use it for their first time into Bitcoin.

No, but they would have a disincentive to invest or purchase things.


Yeah, good humor radar.  I was kidding a bit talking about an inflationary environment where waiting a year would double your spending power, but also making a point.  "People do that now. All the time in fact."  Rational people give up 100% yearly growth in purchasing power all the time?  I'd have to see that.


You're equating wealth with numbers in a bank acount.  Inflation incentivizes people to not purchase or invest.  It also values a unit of work done in the past as more valuable than a unit of work done presently.  It raises prices of necessities and decreases value of non-necessities which increases risk and lowers returns from investments, which makes it hard for economies to function smoothly.  Even in a stati currency with no inflation or deflation, if you have an icreasing population, you have de facto deflation.  At least in my view, real wealth is owning real assets, not numbers in a bank.  Currency just facilitates converting work and investments into other assets.


People at the bottom don't have anything.  Without inflation they would just make less money (as in less real money, less purchasing power).  There would be less investment, and fewer jobs.

Nope, only if there is an intention to defraud.  The other law regarding money has to do with melting down nickels and pennies.  Those coins specifically are illegal to melt down because some pennies and nickels are very close to this point too, are actually worth more melted down than face value.  This law was created in congress recently.  Part of the law also says that it is illegal to bring more than five dollars worth of change outside of the united states (to stop people from bringing truckloads of pennies across the border to then melt down.)  I think at its peak, a copper penny was worth about 2.5 cents.
