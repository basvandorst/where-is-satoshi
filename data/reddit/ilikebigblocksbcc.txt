Interesting

Hmmmm I don't know....
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:48:51
Yeah that was core sarcasm lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:02:16
Where is it in the white paper????

It would suck to be that woman now- but it would also suck to be that guy. He might have some money- but god damn what an asshole.

Bullcoin? Bitbull?  Pitbit?

If it happened after- then why would Craig Wrright be against it?!
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:34:48
YEAH!  And I heard Crooked Hillary and Aspy Roger are in cohoots!  They cooked up this Coinbase insider trading scandal on their own- as we all know Crooked Hillary secretly controls Coinbase. 
Oh- and Antbleed?  It's Crooked Hillary, Jihan, and their Chinese cronies!!

No no no no no no no no no 
Satoshi's vision or GTFO.

My friends and I usually call it bitcorn, bortcorn, or bjorkcorn. Bjorkcoin would probably work too.

This is really interesting. I think it might inspire confidence in new investors. 
Also, my guess is that otherwise inexplicable candles- whether they are red or green- have more to do with not trading and events going on World wide that we are not aware of in the anglosphere and on Reddit.

BOOM!!  
When the read about Satoshi’s vision, you KNOW they will go BCH aka real Bitcoin over pumped up Barely Tradable Coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:26:17
It would appear so. 
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:16:48
CANT WAIT TO HAVE MY BOA BCH WALLET!!
@_date: 2018-03-24 07:03:57
But if it's a vote against Satoshi's Vision, how can that be a TRUE consensus?  Who are we to deviate from the path?  I feel like Ver is the only one smart enough to understand that and not be afraid to go against the grain- that's why he is criticized so much. He's the true crypto anarchist / cyber punk!  I never hate a doer for "doing" you know?
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:01:32
But it's the true Bitcoin. It follows Satoshi's Vision!!  Core pump coin isn't Bitcoin- it's something else now. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:52:57
All I got to say is SVOGTFO.
Satoshi's Vision Or Get The Fuck Out
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:19:59
What about Bitcoin Cash?!
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:00:13
I just feel like every generation has great men who are true visionaries. Satoshi, Musk, Ver- these are the Ford's and Edison's and Carnegie's of our time. Why wouldn't I repeat this "talking point" as you call it?  When great men do great things it's best to lead, follow, or get out the way!

I �� this picture!!
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:42:22
With that color?  Definitely Bitcoin Cash!
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:14:13
BCH=Satoshi's Vision=BITCOIN. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:54:05
Psssh you mean tiny little gold flakes. Meanwhile BCH is like having giant big ass gold blocks in your account!!
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:05:36
Whatever "Big Jim"- 
Keep your teeny tiny blocks while I rock out to Satoshi's TRUE inspired Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:41:16
I hope they take bitcoin cash!!
