At around 3:00, the reasoning for why banning cash notes is bullish for btc is flawed. The statement that government debt correlates with capital controls may or may not be true, but the video fails to show causation. The fact that it goes on to predict where future capital controls are going to happen shows a lack of critical thinking. It's a bit like saying "Ice cream consumption and good weather is highly correlated" and then going on to predict that people who eats a lot of ice cream can expect good weather.
Moreover, it paints the banning of cash notes in India as a disaster for the country and its economy, with "hundreds dead" and reduced financial activity. It is true that India saw a slight decrease in financial activity, but the measure is believed to be an investment in the long term economic health of the country, since 80% of the GDP was "black money", a figure that is expected to decrease significantly. The video also makes a statement on how devastating the ban was to the Indian people, because so few have bank accounts. I'm not denying the fact that it probably caused a lot of stress for those people, but the fact that the general population, including the poor, is happy with the change, shows that it really wasn't so devastating to the poor population in India, nor to the Indian economy as a whole, as the video would have us believe.
Next, at 3:08, it says 
*"Money that is traceable means higher tax revenues"* Sure, traceable money and tax revenue may or may not historically had a correlation, but again, claiming causation on something this complex is ridiculous. 
*"Traceable money means a third party is involved in all transactions"* Again, yes, usually there is a third party involved in fiat transactions, and yes, fiat transactions are mostly traceable. However this statement is clearly false. If I give a bank note to a friend, there was no third party involved, just me, my friend, and the bank note. For a btc tx, swap out the bank note for a bitcoin, and it's the same thing. Moreover, being traceable does not in and of itself mean that there must be a third party involved.
At that point I stopped watching.

So you are basically telling a lie and trying to disguise it to look like a question. I don't see what's in it for you.

This is exactly the same as saying "If bitcoin price was x, market cap would be y".

Yeah, they were prob in the right for closing OP's account. OP could have been GAMBLING with that BTC �� Which is one of the reasons why coinbase will close an account

I fully agree with you - it's stuff like this that creates and intensifies the conflict and the "us vs. them" mentality.
Imagine a r/bitcoin where everyone was engaged in rewarding and respectful debate about the different scaling approaches every day. Debates that challenges your point of view and forces you to acknowledge both disadvantages with the approach you support, and advantages with other approaches.
Imagine a subreddit that contributed to reaching a community-wide consensus instead of hindering it.
Don't criticize your opponent. Criticize their code! (in a respectful manner)
Like this: 
*"The recent serious bugs in BU's code shows that peer-review and testing is not good enough, which is extremely worrying because of the nature of their software. Also, their scaling solution is in danger of promoting centralization because xx"*
**Not** like this: 
*"BTU is aiming to enable re-centralization of mining, nodes and software development.[...] [BTU] wants perpetual war and perpetual infighting and it will do anything it can do to achieve that and that means that the next iteration of the counter-revolution is already at your doorstep."*

Not sure I fully agree on that. Bugs that are live for a (relatively) long time without making an impact is usually the hardest ones to weed out. If it's true that there was another two safeties, then the contributor and reviewer might have relied on one of those.
However, commenting out code like that is something that's usually done when you don't fully remember what it does and what it impacts, and want to test some changes. Really bad practice to keep commented out code in a live release.

Keep in mind that despite there being no fee, most sellers charge a little more than market price.

Not paying the bonds would free up a lot more cash, not less. Nobody is buying newly issued bonds from the Venezuelan government regardless. Even buying Venezuelan government bonds from a third party is generally being avoided. Goldman got themselves in a PR nightmare just for buying the bonds from a third party with their clients' funds.

That doesn't work at all. If you try this, you will find that almost every post in r/Bitcoin is politically motivated. Even the OP. And all those posts about Craig Wright. And all those posts about Jihan. Those posts are clearly made with the intention of having a level-headed debate.

The people who are in power. They are letting their people suffer so that they can keep paying themselves
@_date: 2017-07-03 09:01:50
They didn't raise any cash in 2017?
If you are referring to the Goldman purchase - third party trading of bonds doesn't affect the government balance whatsoever.
For example, if I own a US treasury bond issued in 2015, and sell it to you today, the US government doesn't get any cash from today's sale.
Also, I think you are missing my point a bit. Maduro is only interested in staying in power and keeping/increasing his wealth, which he does by continuing payments on their bonds. So I agree that he doesn't give a damn, but his strategy is hurting Venezuela's ability to raise cash and it's hurting the Governments ability to pay for essential services for their citizens.

It's pretty sad how the government keeps paying their bonds. They should have defaulted on them a long time ago and instead paid for basic services for their people. This is the norm for bonds issued by governments, and bondholders were aware of the risk, and expected the government to default.
Anyone curious about why they don't just default on their bonds? I'll give you a hint. Guess who some of the biggest bondholders are.
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:49:10
It wouldn't be arbitrary. Their economic situation is worse than that of other nation states that have defaulted, and a default process with a fair debt restructuring is something creditors would be a lot happier with than the current situation of arbitrary payment or lack thereof on random bonds. It won't be easy, but it's necessary.
They do indeed have problems importing anything at all, and a default would be the first step on the path to fixing that.

I don't know the answer to that, but I do know that in the very beginning the were sometimes 6+ hours between two blocks.

The amount the government has to pay in interest plus the amount of bonds maturing ($1B+) **far** exceeds the amount that the government is able to raise by issuing new bonds ($0 so far in 2017). In other words, their access to essential credit lines have already been cut.
Venezuela's credit rating is already far lower than the average junk rating, and a debt restructuring would (if done right) is more likely to increase their rating than decreasing it. They still wouldn't be able to raise more cash, but at least they could pay their citizens.
I only mentioned Goldman to illustrate how hard it is for the government to raise cash. I'm more or less neutral on the ethics of Goldman's purchase. Buying newly issued debt from the Venezuelan government is much, much, worse.
