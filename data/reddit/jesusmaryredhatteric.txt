Agreed in the broadest of senses.  Yes, the negative interest rates are intended to increase the supply of money.  An increase in the supply of money by say, 5%, doesn't have a predictable impact on bitcoin though.

Segwit barely moves the needle.  Core devs estimate &lt;10% increased capacity on day 1.  It will take months before it increases capacity to 70%.  If bitcoin keeps growing in popularity, that extra capacity will only buy us a matter of month.

Why does fiat/FR banking require 2% growth?
I'm not at all convinced that PoW offers the benefits (or that other methods have the pitfalls) that most people assume.  PoW only secures the network against average individual attackers, not against ultrarich or state attackers.  Let's imagine that bitcoin is 10x the size it is today.  Total hashing equipment will still cost &lt;$100 billion.  A dozen different countries could easily negate that security.  Then there's the technological problem - if someone comes up with a quantum computer (likely a state actor), they may suddenly have control of the network.  The only way around this is for bitcoin's hash power to grow to a multiple trillion dollar investment, which I think is highly unlikely if the LN ever takes off (since transaction fees will likely never get all that high and block reward will be falling).

You're confused about how the fiat banking system works.  Gaining access to a fiat bank is relatively trivial.  A large percentage of the employees at any particular bank have access to every piece of information relevant to your account.  So what keeps them from stealing it?
Fiat bank money transfers are reversible.  If the transfer is a theft, the receiving bank will simply reverse the transaction after being informed.  Similarly, if you transfer money illegally from a fiat bank to paypal or coinabse or wherever, the bank will simply reverse the transaction.
This is what makes bitcoin so much less secure than fiat for most consumers.  If a thief steals your bank deposit, it might take a couple months, but 99% of the time you'll get your money back because the bank can simply reverse the transaction.  In contrast, once a thief steals your bitcoins, they're gone.
So what about your link?  The Russian hackers success wasn't that they stole the money, that's easy.  It's that they *kept* the money, by messing up the banks' ability to know what money belonged to whom.  Such thefts are incredibly rare and difficult ($650m is less than 1% of 1% of 1% of global bank deposits).

What metric for centralization do you use, or would you prefer to use?  
Not sure if you're being sarcastic on the last part...drugs and online gambling are a perfect example for me: both have been impossible to stamp out specifically because the user bases are so huge.
Governments could shut down bitcoin today via a few routes.  
1. Buy/build enough hash power to co-opt the network (would require less than $10 billion, pennies for the NSA).
2.  Co-opt existing hash power to take over the network: this would involve a mix of bribery, threats, and force.  You just raid a few of the biggest server farms and confiscate the computers while performing a 2-year long "investigation" based on some unsubstantiated evidence of child porn or something.  For other server farms, you just give a juicy bribe to the pool operators, for others, you threaten them with something in their past.
3.  You simply make it illegal.  If China + EU + US all said: "the possession, transmission, or support of bitcoin is now a felony with a 10+ year jail sentence", bitcoin would evaporate.  Sure it wouldn't disappear *completely*, but the value would be &lt;$30, transactions would fall by 95%+, and it would be meaningless except to a few hundred diehards.
4.  Disinformation campaign: a combination of technical disruption (DDOS attacks and spam and temporarily shutting down the major companies and exchanges via forcing ISPs to disable the websites temporarily and/or criminal investigations into the companies), and disinformation (co-opt a couple core devs with extortion/bribery, create confusion as to what's going on and who the bad actors are, etc, and faith in the network would collapse.

The context of this discussion is the claim of "tech start-up like innovation."  Tech start-ups pursue high risk, high reward, fast and aggressive innovation.  You simply *can't* succeed as a slow and steady incrementalist if you're a tech start-up.  Bitcoin is acting nothing like a tech start-up.
Whether that's a good or bad thing depends on your vision for bitcoin.  If you think of bitcoin as already a success and you don't much care if it ends up with 20 million or 500 million users, than a "safety first" mindset makes sense.  But I think bitcoin is in beta.  It's still mostly just potential.  It's current market cap and user base are trivial.  I'm excited for what bitcoin *could* become, and that vision requires more aggressive innovation.

The things you're listing as faults were explicit strengths.  The community said, "we like core, we just want core with a 2 MB HF."  Core said, "we're not doing that."  So Gavin said, okay, we'll provide you with core + 2 MB HF.
Second, I think your perspective on public opinion is very heavily skewed.  You keep saying stuff that is totally wrong like "no one believes" or "people perceive" and I'm sure you think you're being honest.  Your perception is just wrong because you're getting your opinion from a forum that specifically promotes those opinions and censors opposing ones.  It's like if mostly read r/btc and then told you, "people perceive blockstream and core devs as totally corrupt; people think they're actively sabotaging bitcoin development to pad Adam Back's wallet."  such a statement would be wrong, but would appear valid to someone who mostly reads r/btc.

"representative democracy has given us nothing but plutocracy and kleptocracy" - statements like this are only relevant in relation to a governing alternative.  plutocracy and kleptocracy are just specific manifestations of the basic human nature of self-interest (or call it greed if you like).  We're not looking for perfection, simply the best system available.  And as for "given us nothing but...", really?  Representative democracy has consistently given us the most stable and prosperous societies in the history of the world.  Maybe call it a terrible system that is simply the least bad of any we've yet tried.
I think anarchic systems fail because we all want things. We are all members of dozens of different special interest groups - the group of parents or latinos or doctors or city-dwellers etc, and a large portion of us look to increase our share of the pie via the political system.  Similarly, when people try to talk about the benefits of laissez-faire capitalism, I point out that the very rich aren't capitalists at heart, they're simply self-interested(and I don't mean that in a bad way.)  As they accumulate substantial money, they will inevitably use that money to shape the political sphere to benefit themselves - this takes the form of "regulatory capture" for example.  
Whenever I have debates like this - I find that people want to separate economics, politics, and psychology.  You can't.  The 3 are intertwined.  Communism can't work because people are self-interested by nature and always will be, and I suspect that anarchic systems can't work because every special interest group wants bigger government that will shift some of the pie to them.  I work in finance (and firmly identify as a capitalist), but usually find myself arguing that some degree of regulation and redistribution is critical for capitalism to work successfully because of political and psychological realities.

B has existed for thousands of years.  It's called gold.  All of your caveats apply equally well to bitcoin.  It took me 20+ hours to get some level of confidence that I'm storing my bitcoin securely (as a very tech savvy person), and even now I'm at risk if my hardware came preinstalled with a virus, if the network falls apart, if a state decides to take control of the hash power, or if a quantum computer comes along sooner than expected.  
  People stopped using gold to pay for stuff because fiat was just more convenient. Similarly, why do you think bitcoin hasn't taken off for purchases, even with many merchants offering 5% discounts?  Venmo/paypal/visa are just more convenient.
  I do think bitcoin will eventually succeed as an additional store of value comparable to gold, but lets not fool ourselves into thinking its disruptive except as a way for rich people to evade capital controls in countries like China and Russia.
@_date: 2016-03-29 17:00:51

You actually hit the nail on the head (or at least hinted at it.)
Bitcoin is specifically a system with no reliance on laws or regulations.  It relies a little on external incentives via economics: a major thing keeping miners from attacking the network is that they invest massively in mining hardware and their return is heavily tied to the price of bitcoin, so anything that lowers the price of bitcoin substantially would likely be counterproductive for them.  Somewhat ironically, this actually means that bitcoin with more centralized mining is in at least one way, "safer" than bitcoin with truly decentralized mining, because there is a stronger disincentive for miners to act badly when their hardware investment is a larger percentage of total hashpower.  This is just one element of the mining incentives - for other reasons (that are tangential to the current conversation) a decentralized system is safer.  These incentive systems have worked fairly well, but of course, there have been numerous doublespend attacks in bitcoin's history, some of them successful.
Now let's compare that to a bank consortium.  Most banks already operate in countries with strong rules of law.  Additionally, banks' brands and reputations represent a large percentage of their value.  For example, if Goldman Sachs made a billion dollars by (legally) cheating Bank of America, they would likely lose far more than a billion in lost business when other banks responded by shunting business away from Goldman.  Now consider if a consortium of 20 banks specifically agree to form a blockchain.  Anyone caught acting badly (via, say, finding a loophole or mistake in the code to exploit) would be kicked out of the consortium forever and lose out on tons of business.  More broadly though, the blockchain of the consortium can be generally structured such that only a supermajority could screw over the minority.  In this scenario, the thing keeping the supermajority in line is very similar to in bitcoin - if the supermajority screws the minority, belief in the system falls apart and the value of the consortium is radically diminished; it's unlikely that the one time gain would be greater than the loss of the consortium.  But for banks it's even more severe than in bitcoin since banks are *also* subject civil and criminal penalties for violating the consortium contracts (potentially, depending on how the consortium is formed), *and* the banks are banks and have to keep banking.  In contrast, a miner who lands a big score in bitcoin could either start mining another crypto (if any are big enough at that point), or just go retire to a beach.
Banks rarely steal from one another - the existing laws and regulations do a pretty good job.  The reason banks are interesting in blockchain tech is for *efficiency.*  Currently, reconciling a single stock trade requires the brokerage firm, clearing firm, exchange, and bank, to all communicate information along separate channels and using separate software.  When they're a human or technical error, it's time consuming and costly to reconcile.  A blockchain potentially makes this process much faster and cheaper.  It can turn a 3-day stock settlement procedure that requires 3 dozen personnel into a 1-day procedure that requires 2 people overseeing it.

It's not quite a binary. We all want both decentralization and mass adoption. It's a question of relative value. We'd all give up a tiny bit of decentralization (say the node count dropping by 10%), if it meant quadrupling the user base. Gavin places more weight on adoption than, say, Maxwell.
I'd also note that decentralization can be viewed in a broader context. Personally, I think whether the node count is at 5k or 3k, or 8k is relatively trivial. Any big government can still shutdown bitcoin any time they want, because it's still way too small. The best way to decentralize bitcoin and make it more government resistant is to massively increase everything - the user base, the hash power, the number of nodes, the number of developer teams etc.  With a massive increase in user base (and # of people owning substantial bitcoins) comes political resistance to government interference.  A massive increase in users and bitcoin businesses probably also means a big increase in the number of people running full nodes for validation purposes.  That massive increase would also mean much bigger hashing power, which would be harder for, say, the NSA to co-opt or do a 51% attack on.  
Lastly, "decentralization" applies not only to full node count, but also to mining and protocol control.  
@_date: 2016-03-23 15:11:07
You don't seem to understand what "consensus" means.
This is a basic misunderstanding. Miners need to be able to sell their coins, which means 75% of miners will only support a fork like Classic if they are extremely confident that the most economically important full nodes (exchanges) will also support Classic. And if miners and exchanges support a fork to classic, then the vast majority of the rest of the bitcoin ecosystem as well will for a variety of simple reasons:
People want bitcoins that they can buy/sell on exchanges.
People want bitcoins that have a confirmation time of less than an hour. If &lt;25% of miners are mining a failed fork, the confirmation times balloon and difficulty won't reset for 2+ months.
So if a Classic fork happens, it means by definition that most miners and most economically important full nodes already support it, and that will bring with it support of the vast majority of bitcoin users.
TLDR: If a classic fork happens, it by definition must mean that it has superconsensus support from the broad community, including miners and exchanges.

Of course the 90% of miners would have to screw the remaining 10%.  That's a total non-sequitur.  No one said otherwise.  
You just admitted that 90% of miners could screw you (or 50%) and you still call bitcoin trustless, while complaining that a multisig or PoS isn't trustless.  It's clear you don't understand what those words mean.
Let me dumb it down for you:  Bitcoin requires you to trust that miners won't band together to screw you.  A private blockchain similarly requires that you trust that the majority of other participants don't band together to screw you.  Both are "trustless" in similar ways.

You repeatedly dismiss the argument without offering any logic against it.  You call DDOS resistance a "thin disguise."  Tell that to the many people running classic nodes who got DDOS'ed.

I was careful to note that hash power is just one part of the bitcoin power scheme.  The other is "economically important" full nodes.  The rules that the big exchanges and big bitcoin companies choose to implement mostly determine what bitcoin's rules will be.  Of course those exchanges and big companies have to service their users, so the users have indirect input as well.  
It's symbiotic.  If miners try to fork away from what the economically important full nodes are running, they will have no where to sell their coins (and anywhere they can find to sell their coins, the coins will be devalued).  If economically important full nodes try to fork to something the miners dislike, their block confirmation times will skyrocket and the network will be far less secure.
If both those groups try to fork to something that most users dislike, it opens space for competition: e.g. some new exchange can be born that caters to the majority of unhappy users, putting the old economically important full nodes out of business.

Ugh, so many simple mistakes.
First your link to HSBC has nothing to do with "fiat banking is already theft."  It's an example of a specific felony by a specific bank.  Of course every bank commits the occasional felony, as does every company, and almost every individual...that doesn't mean anything.
The Federal Reserve's legal status is a favorite of tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists everywhere who never got past economics 101.  What the simpletons fail to understand is that owning huge amounts of US debt while simultaneously debasing the currency helps debtors and hurts creditors.  It's awesome for citizens who are effectively getting to borrow from the Fed at below market interest rates, while the Fed "gets paid back" in devalued dollars.
Your specific examples of banks refusing to reverse transactions supports my point.  They make the news because they are exceptionally rare.  In bitcoin, when someone loses their bitcoin because they exposed their private key, it's not even a news story.  It's just standard.  But major bank thefts are so incredibly rare that each one gets a news story.  Those exceptions reflect less than 0.01% of banking assets.  In contrast, more than 10% (at bare minimum) of all bitcoins every produced have been stolen at least once from darknet markets, Mt. Gox, etc.
If I wanted to attack bitcoin, I would post a dozen links to poor individuals (like those in your last link) who lost their bitcoins when they received hardware preinstalled with viruses, or had their computers hacked, or their brainwallet cracked, etc.  And of course..no one helped them either....

The actions of the politician to end democracy would certainly be anti-democracy (like when Hitler was democratically elected and then dismantled the democratic institutions). 
I don't see an analogy here.  Classic hasn't proposed anything new or any radical change to the nature of bitcoin.  Core has the same 2 MB HF proposal on their timeline.  The only questions  are timing (do we hardfork to 2 MB before or after SegWit), and consensus (exactly what constitutes consensus?  75%, 90%, 95%?).

The whole point of my statement is that individual users and full node operators are specifically driven to follow the economically important nodes for clear and specific reasons.  Why would all of the exchanges ever adapt a fork if they thought it would put them out of business?  Of course I agree that if 99% of bitcoin users adapt fork A, then adapting for B would be a bad idea for miners/exchanges, but that's at the network level, not at the individual decision level.  Exchanges and miners make decisions at least partially as a group.  
This is challenging because we're trying to both talk about abstract ideas while retaining an element of the practical.  
Here's how I think the decision making actually happens:
1. Technical experts, or 2. economically important nodes, or 3. miners, raise an issue that causes them to want a fork.  Random users could raise an issue too, but it won't gain traction unless one of these 3 groups champions it.  If all 3 groups champion it, great, that's the new bitcoin.  In our current scenario, there's a possibility of groups 2 and 3 supporting a fork without support from group 1.  So what happens?  If 2 and 3 get together and become convinced that they both support the fork *and* both groups believe that the majority of bitcoin users will go along with that fork, than they are likely to push forward, and if they push forward, most users will indeed likely go along for the ride so that they will have bitcoins they can buy/sell/spend.
Now, how do we know ahead of time if most bitcoin users will go along for the ride?  You can try to get a rough sense from forums and what release full nodes run, but the reality is that most bitcoin users are "passive."  2 million+ bitcoins are on Coinbase.  Most of these people will leave those coins on coinbase.  These are people who don't have strong opinions on blocksize or don't care or don't follow the debate at all.  Same with Circle and Bitpay etc.  Most of their customers will stay with them under most scenarios.
As long as the fork doesn't look to the average user like a very specific "attack" from a particular contingent on them, they'll go about life as usual.  
So for example - if and when core releases the fork on their roadmap, do you think there's a risk that most bitcoin users will reject it?  Of course not.  Since that fork has support from exchanges and miners, even if bitcoin users disagree with the hard fork, nearly all will go along with the ride because while they might think it's suboptimal, they won't sacrifice economic value over a difference of opinion.

You keep countering future tense with present tense.
People are forward-looking creatures.  Businesses make forward looking plans.  Entrepreneurs and engineers and VCs look forward.  Bitcoin is still in beta.  It's being built as we speak.  There's hundreds of millions of dollars a year being spent on building services on the bitcoin blockchain right now.
Open Bazaar is about to launch.  It might result in nothing, or maybe one of their users or the team itself will discover their "killer app", some product/service that sells particularly well there.  My best guess is that it's likely to be some sort of microtransaction.  Such a killer app might simply never get off the ground because of high fees or RBF.
It's not about "how many are going to leave", it's more about how many new use cases will simply never be born.  
Imagine we look at a tiny town in the Nevada Desert with poor road access.  Someone says, "if we build a good road to Las Vegas, we can create a booming town with amazing economics."  And you respond, "but almost no one comes here currently.  you really think that if we fail to build this road, that tons of people will leave the town to go to Atlantic City to gamble instead?"  And I'm answering, "no, I think that if you build the highway new people will come here to gamble, if you don't, those same people might end up in atlantic city to gamble."  The current population is irrelevant.

Localbitcoin traders will hop on the dominant chain.  Same with DNM operators.  
If the biggest exchange operators and a couple huge bitcoin companies announce they will back a particular fork, you'd likely get 75%+ of miners soon announcing they will support the same (unless they feel the fork is specifically damaging to them.)  At that point you have a clear majority of exchanges, companies, and miners supporting a particular fork, so those localbitcoins traders and DNM will jump on.  If they don't, they're screwed since they'd be on a chain with confirmation time of 40+ minutes that's very susceptible to 51% attacks.

Kind of.  The way any complex system works is that only a tiny minority of the community will have the time/skill to fully evaluate every detail.  How many people read every line of code in each new Core release?  Even if we have the skill to do so, we lack the time.  And of course, most of us lack the skill to fully understand every line of code and its possible effects.  
And even if we understood every line of code, how many of us can correctly interrupt the economic and psychological effects of code changes on the community?  Even the top core devs are struggling with this part.  
So, the community is forced to trust our "representatives" on the details.  And we place our trust based partly on character.

So what determines whether something is an altcoin is the team that releases it?  I.e. if Core releases a 2 MB hardfork it's not an alt-coin, but if Classic releases it regardless of how much support it gets, it's an altcoin?  Just want to understand how you think about this.

Open Bazaar's business model isn't really clear (even to them).  It's likely to find a killer app almost accidentally. Something like people who brew their own beer in their garage and want to be able to sell it to friends.  These people don't need TOR level privacy, but they can't sell through existing channels because the big companies like ebay and amazon won't let them.
Open Bazaar hasn't even really launched yet, so I can't say it's being held back by anything, but the math is pretty straightforward.  A lot of the shops that people have set up so far are for micropayment type transactions.  A fee much above where we are now will either force people looking to make these transactions to leave Open Bazaar, or will force Bazaar to consider adding other cryptocurrencies to support that user base.

"btw core are also ok with a 2MB block size increase and are currently rolling it out"  
You realize Classic only exists because Core adamantly refused to roll out a 2 MB HF, right?  The classic team *begged* core to upgrade the network for 4 months before defeatedly realizing they would have to do it themselves.  The high level of support Classic got initially forced Core's hand to add a 2 MB HF with a concrete timeline to their own roadmap.  If and when Core finally upgrades the network, we'll have the Classic team to thank.

House?  Far more likely scenario is someone buys something like another crypto with their BTC and then transfers that crypto to another address, so the property can't be taken back.
As for waiting 6+ confirmations - businesses compete to offer lower confirmation transactions.  Any business could simply wait 10+ confirmations, but then people like me would take our business elsewhere because we don't like waiting so long.  Certainly as the perceived threat of doublespends goes up, businesses will generally start demanding that customers wait for more confirmations.
  I agree this is not an existential threat to the network.  I was simply explaining why it can be an attractive attack for the person doing it.

Your link confuses bandwith with computational power.  Bitcoin's scaling problem has nothing to do with the size of the blockchain (the entirety of which can be stored on a $5 USB drive), nor with CPU power (a $50 CPU can easily serve as a full node), but with bandwith.  Specifically, users in China and some rural areas lack the bandwith to support much larger blocks every 10 minutes.

Why do you keep repeating nonsense?  This isn't about transaction fees going up a few cents as you well know.  It's about people (many of whom have posted their issues on reddit) being unable to use bitcoin because of congestion.  When fees become very volatile and unpredictable, it's not a question of the *level* of fees, it's that you submit a transaction with a fee that seems high enough only to see the necessary fee double for the next block.  There is no smart fee released yet that can deal with this problem.  All the smart fees are *backward looking.*  They calculate a fee based on recent fees.  If congestion spikes *after* you submit a transaction, you're just screwed.

It's obvious you've never run a business or an IT department or a military operation.  You don't *react* to panic scenarios.  You *plan* and *anticipate* them.  If bitcoin waits for the network to fall apart before implementing a scaling solution, it will likely be too late.  You view the current congestion as not problematic.  Fine.  Imagine problematic congestion, whatever that entails for you.  Fees at $0.50 or $5, an overloaded mempool forcing nodes off the grid, whatever extreme and problematic congestion looks like to you.  What happens in that scenario?  
One possibility is that a large percentage of the bitcoin ecosystem - developers, VCs, entrepreneurs, users, merchants, miners simply switch to a reliable crypto.  Much of the existing infrastructure could be switched over to an altcoin within a few days, weeks at most.  Again, consider the Friendster analogy.  If you wait till the system is overloaded, you lose users to a competitor and will likely never get them back again.  You effectively *create* a viable competitor where there was none before.  
I want bitcoin to succeed.  I have most of my wealth in it.  That's why I'm terrified when inexperienced people like yourself take a "if it ain't broke don't fix it" approach.  Businesses and technologies that take that approach *always* fail, because they get replaced by something more nimble.  Bitcoin is in beta.  It's a new technology and a new financial architecture.  It *must* be nimble and continue evolving or it *will* die and get replaced by something more able to fulfill user needs.

Oh man where to start.  Here's one to start with:  According to Samson, Classic is an "assault on the network" and "contentious" because 75% is too low a threshold for consensus, while Core's hard fork to 2mb isn't contentious or an attack because it's being done by Core.  lolz.  
@_date: 2016-03-23 17:51:02
Of course.
Centralization is a necessary condition for a 51% attack, but will not necessarily result in one.  The point is just that they are extremely connected.  Under totally decentralized mining, a 51% attack is impossible, probability = 0.  In a highly centralized mining scenario, a 51% attack is easy, so probability &gt; 0. 
@_date: 2016-03-15 22:25:14
I think if the US government (or NSA) wanted to attack bitcoin, they'd use a combination of these methods.  So for example, if they went with the "buying hashpower" route, they'd also use a disinformation campaign to make hardforking to a different proof of work algorithm impossible to coordinate in an organized fashion.  
Your point on drugs is valid - but doesn't negate my point.  If you have an ecosystem with 5 growers and 50 users, it's far easier to shut down than one with 5,000 growers and 50,000 users.  
Similarly, the NSA can track TOR communications - it's just incredibly time consuming.  If there are 20 million people using TOR worldwide, it's harder for the NSA to identify which people they need to zero in on.  If there are only 10,000 active TOR users, the NSA can zoom in quickly.  It's the equivalent of having to find an escaped prisoner in a search area.  If the search area is 4 city blocks, police can easily go door to door and use thermal imagining on every house and the person *will* be caught.  If the search area is 400 miles, the person has a good shot of escape, because law enforcement resources are limited.  
I share your view on decentralization; node count is a quick and flawed proxy.  I also value decentralization in protocol development.  If the future of bitcoin is controlled by a half dozen developers, it's far easier to co-opt by someone with the means and ability to extort/bribe/coerce.

The "recipient" in this case is just a computer program.  If I make a purchase on shapeshift.io or an exchange, a human is highly unlikely to notice a particular transaction in real-time.

@_date: 2016-03-23 15:09:36
This is a basic misunderstanding.  Miners need to be able to sell their coins, which means 75% of miners will only support a fork like Classic if they are extremely confident that the most economically important full nodes (exchanges) will also support Classic.  And if miners and exchanges support a fork to classic, then the vast majority of the rest of the bitcoin ecosystem as well will for a variety of simple reasons:
1. People want bitcoins that they can buy/sell on exchanges.
2. People want bitcoins that have a confirmation time of less than an hour.  If &lt;25% of miners are mining a failed fork, the confirmation times balloon and difficulty won't reset for 2+ months.
So if a Classic fork happens, it means by definition that most miners and most economically important full nodes already support it, and that will bring with it support of the vast majority of bitcoin users.

What is the falsehood exactly?
I think people often confuse "conspiracy" for "powerful incentives."  There's a lot of interesting research on why people in various industries (like finance) end up having very similar political opinions.  The conclusions are that 1. It's self-selecting, people with specific worldviews select those professions, 2. You gain the opinions of people you're surrounded by because you hear those arguments all the time, and 3. You subconsciously adopt opinions that benefit you, including ones that benefit you by making you fit in with those around you.
The main argument I hear about blockstream is simply that they very explicitly and honestly and openly state their vision for bitcoin as one that depends on LN to scale.  Whether that vision is based on   or  described above is kind of irrelevant, but it highly likely involves all 3.  That's not conspiracy, that's just human psychology.  The problem is that their vision for bitcoin is at odds with the vision for bitcoin that much of the community has.

1. Bitcoin development shouldn't be controlled by any one group.

3.  Coinbase also has an exchange, and their exchange model is similar to most other exchanges - of course they want users to use their exchange, same with bitfinex and BTCE and whatever.  If you think it's bad for bitcoin to have exchanges, well, that's not a very smart opinion.  But the vast majority of coinbase's revenue has come from their charges to convert fiat to bitcoin.  They've been an easy and safe avenue for many current bitcoin users to buy their first bitcoin.  
4. The irony of complaining about coinbase not caring about centralization while you demand centralization of development is amusing.

I agree that having a big stake is one of many metrics for trust.
It's worth noting though that a big stake can produce perverse incentives.  I'm an investor.  When I invest in hedge funds that focus on a specific niche, I actually prefer that the manager of the hedge fund not have more than 50% of his wealth in his own fund.  The reason is that if he has 100% in the fund, he is likely to invest very conservatively to avoid getting wiped out.  From my perspective though, my investment in his fund might only be 5% of my wealth.  I'm well diversified in many different types of investments.  So I want that particular hedge fund to invest aggressively, in say, Californian real estate.  Because I'm diversified, I don't care about the *idiosyncratic* risk of that investment, since it will be balanced by the rest of the portfolio.  I want each of my investments to intelligently pursue a return maximization strategy.  
Similarly, bitcoin is in beta.  It is trivial in size relative to what we hope it will become.  And it's competitive "moat" is still relatively small.  Bitcoin needs to continue innovating and taking the occasional risk to fulfill its potential.  If someone is "bitcoin rich" with almost all their wealth in bitcoin, they may focus more on loss avoidance than helping bitcoin achieve its potential.  And ironically, I think that's actually the riskiest strategy since if bitcoin stagnates, it's likely to eventually be surpassed by competing Fintech.

This is complete FUD r/killerstorm.  What's the difference between renting hardware and buying it?  What if Classic simply bought ASICs instead of working with Slush?  By your definition, anyone who invests in mining that you don't like you can accuse of engaging in a "bribe attack."
The premise of bitcoin is that one source of "voting" is hash power.  If people invest in hash power and vote in a way you dislike, that's not an "attack", any more than someone who votes in an election for a candidate you dislike is an attack on democracy.

There's no reason to "set proper expectations for blockchain usage."  Peoples' behavior will change in response to fees almost immediately. 
Listen, the LN network will be here eventually.  And when it is, it will hopefully be great for small transactions.  But it doesn't exist yet.  While we wait for its deployment, I would personally prefer not to send hundreds of thousands of potential bitcoin users to competitors.  Some of those people may go to Venmo or Dash or Litecoin or Paypal and never come back to bitcoin even after LN is released.  
Lastly, the centralized governance system we have now is far from ungovernable.  A dozen core devs have a stranglehold on the system.  They decide when and how the system hard forks.  They decide when and if we increase block size or increase the block reward.  That's scary as hell.

I don't understand why people like yourself get so confused over the issue of trust.  
Things like multisig let you create a trustless environment without PoW comparable to bitcoin's trustless environment.  For example, imagine a consortium of 12 banks use a 9 of 12 multisig.  Bank A is trusting that 9 "enemy" banks won't team up to screw them.  This is similar to submitting a transaction and hoping that 90% of miners won't team up to screw you.  In both cases, you don't need to trust any particular counterparty or group of counterparties or central authority, but you do need to trust the system as a whole.
@_date: 2016-03-29 18:30:39
You can today, the same way you can with bitcoins...
When you spend bitcoin at 99.9% of the vendors that accept it, what you're doing is paying bitcoin to an intermediary who converts it to fiat and then gives the stores the fiat.  The stores never receive bitcoin.
Similarly, I can instantly convert my gold to fiat and and buy stuff from a store online.  
As for spending gold or bitcoin directly - I'd wager that far more people buy stuff with gold then bitcoin currently if we look globally.
But all of this is besides the point.  Why does anyone buy anything with bitcoin?  Mostly darknet where it's not the bitcoin they care about, but simply having hard to trace online money.  People would be just as happy using a program that lets them wire USD fiat via an anonymized blockchain.

Classic was only born after the community *begged* core devs to lead a HF to 2 MB.  Gavin never wanted any control or power, that's why he walked away when Satoshi handed him the keys.  Classic will surely disband if and when Core releases the code the community demands.

I think people underestimate simple competition.  Bitcoin isn't the only fintech in town.  Higher fees, slower confirmations, general uncertainty over scaling etc is forcing users to consider competitors.  We're creating a real risk that some competing Fintech leapfrogs.

Indeed.  To me, decentralization is critical, but the current focus is myopic.  The level of decentralization in the next 12 months, whether 3k or 5k or 8k nodes is relatively trivial; I don't think 3k vs 5k nodes creates a short-term "existential" risk to bitcoin.   I care much more about bitcoin's level of decentralization in 3 years.

That's a non-sequitur.  **no one** is against the development of LN itself.  The point is that *other* scaling methods can later be *supplemented* with LN, when LN is finally available.  
Consider a small company with an inflow of customers.  Someone says, "this store space is too small, why don't we buy the place next door and knock down a wall to combine them?"  Someone else retorts, "you moron, do you think doubling our space will be sufficient to support the 100x growth we hope to have over the next decade?  Instead of doubling capacity immediately, let's do absolutely nothing instead for now."

As a DNM user, when I transfer bitcoins to the DNM and have to wait for confirmations, it's already annoying having to wait 40+ minutes.  No way I would wait 3+ hours.  I'd simply switch to using a DNM that had adopted the fork with mining support.
I didn't call you out on it before, but you keep bringing up centralization.  No one has ever seriously proposed a fork that would directly impact centralization in a meaningful way.  Some people suspect that a substantial increase in blocksize might decrease full node count, and even those people have no idea by how much.  Others think bigger blocks might result in more full nodes by encouraging adoption and increasing the number of people eager to validate transactions and support the network.  Regardless of who's right, the difference of 2500 full nodes vs 5000 vs 7500 is probably less significant to the DNM business model than the ability to actually conduct transactions with reliable confirmation times.  
Tens of thousands of bitcoins?  You're kidding right?  Coinbase alone controls 2 million bitcoins and you know how they'd vote.  
Lastly, I already corrected you on the bitcoin users.  Bitcoin users who don't run full nodes aren't relevant.  They're on whatever fork their "host" is on.  For the plurality of small bitcoin users, that's Coinbase, who clearly support an immediate HF.
@_date: 2016-03-15 21:00:59
What do you mean by "same lot"?  The business and economic ecosystem that I'm referring to is you and me, and bitcoin users like us.  It's the people (whoever you think those people *should* be) that do and will benefit from bitcoin.  
And I'm still not clear on what you mean as "best for bitcoin."  Bitcoin itself can't be helped or hurt, it's just code on a machine.  It's a tool for people to benefit.  The question is *who* do we want to benefit and *what* benefits we're trying to give those people.  
Maybe a different hypothetical will help:  someone could argue that what's best for bitcoin would be to have blocksize shrunk to 100 kb, since this might facilitate decentralization since it'd be cheaper to run a full node.  It would also eliminate any risks to network instability from an overloaded mempool.  But I'd argue that making that change would be terrible for bitcoin *users* like you and me, since it would make it much harder to use bitcoin for day to day transactions.  
@_date: 2016-03-21 17:52:28
This is incorrect.  Classic only forks if it has consensus.  This is built into the Classic code.  If Classic exists as a fork, it means it is the dominant fork.

What makes you think that?  Honestly?  All of their actions seem contrary to that thesis.

He's only lead up this new project because the whole bitcoin ecosystem was begging for an upgrade that core refused to deliver.  Everyone, including Gavin, would much prefer it if Core would simply deliver the upgrade.
As for not supporting the roundtable - because it still doesn't give the bitcoin community what we've asked for...it's just more delays for a blocksize increase.
Lastly, don't your conspiracy theories better fit core/blockstream than classic?  The DDOS attacks are targeting classic nodes and miners, not core nodes and miners.  The censorship is targeting pro-classic posts, not pro-blockstream posts.

You have to think about the goal of a trader and what they need to do to accomplish that goal.
If someone has a ton of coins, their main goal is to sell at a better price.  The problem is that pushing the price higher requires buying even more coins.  Such a pump and dump scheme can only be successful if there will be more liquidity at a higher price, otherwise the whale is buying high and selling low (b/c of slippage).
  Alternatively, a whale might be sitting on cash and want to buy bitcoin at a cheaper price.  The problem is that if they're bullish on bitcoin, it's very risky to shortsell a large amount of coins, so again they'd need to hope that there'd be greater liquidity at a lower price so that they could say, push the price down with 500 BTC to then buy 2000 BTC at better prices.
Bitcoin's price has ranged from $160 to $500 recently.  At the currently price of $420, this makes it unlikely that whales would be forcing the price lower.  They had the opportunity to buy large quantities of coins at lower prices, and there's been a lot of volume going through in the $380-$400 range meaning they probably couldn't find the greater liquidity they'd need at lower prices to make the dump profitable.
I've been a professional trader for ages in all sorts of markets.  Pump and dump type schemes happen, but they're very hard to do profitably and far rarer than people think.  99% of the time that I hear people talking about manipulation, it's really just natural order flow driving the market.

You have a really simple misunderstanding, honestly.  There's nothing political about this.  
Just look at these charts and you'll understand if you keep an open mind:
Monetary base: You can see the federal reserve printed a crazy amount of "monetary base" after the financial crisis, multiplying the monetary base by more than 4x.  If the monetary base was actually "money", we would expect the US to be currently suffering hyperinflation.
But we're not suffering hyperinflation and the value of the dollar hasn't collapse by 75% in the last decade.  Why not?
Because M2 (what we think of as "money"), has been rising much less - more or less linearly, but still faster than GDP growth or population growth.
But how can the monetary base grow exponentially while "money" only grows linearly?  Why don't we have hyperinflation? 
Because the velocity of money collapsed after the financial crisis.
Pre-2008, most economists trusted the old intuition that when central banks print tons of money, it devalues the money and you get inflation.  That's true...if the printing of "monetary base" translates into more "money" (M2).  But that requires that the velocity of money stay constant (or at least not collapse sharply).
So why did the velocity of money collapse?  Probably because it was artificially inflated by excessively optimistic consumers and banks.  Banks were making loans like crazy and consumers were borrowing like crazy (via home mortgages, credit card debt etc).  Because of the fractional reserve banking system, when banks make loans, it actually *creates* "money."  This is how "money" can rise faster than the "monetary base."

Agree that patent trolling is unethical.  But you if you use that as a standard to dismiss a business, you'd have to literally to dismiss every medium and large sized business as unethical.
Same applies to people - everyone has done something unethical at some point in their lives. Doesn't mean we're all terrible overall.  
I'm not arguing in favor of Uphold - I know very little about it.  But take Coinbase for example - some people don't like Armstrong's views on blocksize.  Fine.  But even if you think he's hurting bitcoin through that one opinion, I think Coinbase has been a tremendous benefit for bitcoin - a massive gateway for new non-technical users to learn about and enjoy the benefits.

Ah I get your confusion.  You're confusing monetary base, M1, M2, and inflation.
Your link is to a count of the monetary base which refers only to physical notes and deposits with the Federal Reserve; it doesn't include most types of money, including money in your checking and saving account at the bank.  It isn't a measure of what we think of as "money."  What we usually think of as money is referred to as M2, and here's the equivalent chart to what you posted, but for M2: 
The reason the monetary base exploded higher but M2 only continued its normal moderate growth is because the "velocity of money" rose to bubble levels in the 2000s and then collapsed in 2008 and has stayed low ever since.
Now inflation refers to rising prices.  Inflation generally occurs if M2 grows faster than the # of goods produced.  If M2 grows at roughly the same rate as productivity, there's no inflation.  
Here's a chart of realized inflation: 
Inflation is usually measured as "CPI": consumer price index, which measures the change in prices on a basket of typical consumer goods like food, rent, clothing, cars, computers, etc.

Voting is an analogy.  Call it "enforcement" if you want.  The point is that hash power is a key source of what we might call political power in bitcoin.  That was bitcoin's "solution" and the idea behind PoW to secure the network.  Rather than trust a central bank or government bureaucrat or legal system, we trust PoW determined by majority hashing power. 
  I think you could fairly characterize something as a bribery attack if it is sufficiently short-term in nature.  If Classic was renting a huge amount of hash power for a day to some end that'd be one thing.  If people want to rent hash power in an on-going way, I think it's best thought of as simply an economic alternative to buying hash power.

It's hard to give a short answer because it's more of a platform (like the internet) and we don't know exactly what value will be created, but we can guess.  In that regard, it's similar to bitcoin - 5 years ago we didn't know (and mostly still don't know) how most people would use bitcoin - as a currency for day to day transactions?  Remittances?  Store of wealth like gold?  Or would most transactions be about storing information to the blockchain like housing deeds?  The first "killer app" has predictably been darknet markets.  In 5 years bitcoin's primary use may be something completely unforeseen.
Ethereum is a platform for automated contracts and decentralized Apps.  People have written thousands of pages guessing at how those two things will actually be used and create value, but no one really knows.  Ethereum's first "killer app" will probably be something no one saw coming.  Here's a short but useful description.
It may turn out these things aren't a great value, or that some other crypto does it better.  I don't know.  But it's certainly and interesting platform with potential.

Why on earth would banks want to use the bitcoin blockchain as settlement?  Why wouldn't they use a USD denominated blockchain?
Banks also have no use for censorship resistance or "trustless" as we think of it.  The US legal system provides the "trust" for banks in most countries.  
And lastly, the bitcoin blockchain's blocks are limited to once every 10 minutes.  There are alternative that confirm transactions every 20 seconds.  Bitcoin can't do this because we want people to be able to run full nodes at a cost of a few hundred dollars.  Bank don't have this limitation.

No, an externality means its unrelated to the operation, not the user.  For example, a negative externality of driving a car is pollution.  As a car driver, you also suffer (a little) from your own car's pollution.  In contrast, if you dump pollutants in a river, probably only those downstream of you are effected.  
Back to bitcoin - certainly the cost of the network is paid for by someone - Satoshi laid this out clearly.  It's paid for by inflation for the first decade and then will gradually be paid for by fees.  The problem today is that people don't realize inflation is still extremely high and transaction volume is still extremely low.  Trying to shift the cost of the network from inflation to fees now is just unnecessary and premature, and will actually *reduce* the ability to pay for the network by fees, by scaring away bitcoin users and lowering long-term transaction volume.  
  Now, that's true for miners, but not really for nodes.  The cost of running a node cannot be internalized to the network in current form.  Bitcoin as software simply doesn't support it.  LN might let us do that eventually, but as I have to keep reminding people, LN doesn't exist yet, and we don't really know when it will exist.

Ugh, you're repeating yourself over and over because you're simply wrong.  It's like you're shouting at a locomotive running towards you to move over.  
**Wallets can't be psychic.**  Fee volatility has shot through the roof, so wallets are very frequently estimating a reasonable fee and then the transaction fails to go through because congestion increases after the transaction is transmitted.  
And *of course* you're screwed.  You honestly can't conceive of a situation where you'd have a problem because you have *no idea* when you will have access to your money, or when a merchant will receive it?
How about this:  remember all those merchants and users who were converted to bitcoin users because they were told it's a cheap, easy, and secure alternative to visa or paypal or whatever?  Go back and tell them, "listen, when a customer makes a purchase from you using bitcoin, your payment might arrive in 10 or 20 minutes, or it might take 2 hours or 4 hours.  That's totally cool right?"  
They won't be bitcoin users for long.

I don't understand your objection.  In the next 3 months, it seems likely that we will have occasional demand for more than 1 MB worth of transactions in a series of blocks, but probably not more than 2 MB.  Long-term we obviously will need more than 2 MB, but that's not how scaling works.  Scaling is, by definition, an ongoing process.
Imagine a company with 2 servers.  They get a sudden increase in online traffic and want to increase to 4 servers.  Would you tell them to buy *zero* servers, because an extra 2 servers won't support the traffic they may have 10 years down the line?
Almost everyone likes SegWit.  The problem is just that it isn't ready for deployment yet, and even once deployed, it won't produce much of an immediate capacity increase.  It will probably take a couple months for it to produce even a 50% capacity increase (according to core devs).

This is true, but only once bitcoin mining becomes a substantial percentage of electricity demand in that region.  For example, currently, bitcoin mining in China has minimal impact on electricity prices since it's a very small percentage of total electricity demand.
Also, electricity usually isn't a free market.  Most countries regulate, price cap, and/or subsidize their electricity markets.  So it's possible that electricity could remain really cheap in one particular country indefinitely.

The US government doesn't give away anything.  Rather they redistribute money from one group to another.  This is important to understand - the US government doesn't have any assets or any money.  They simply redistribute from some people to other people.
To the extent you want to model the US government as actually owning stuff - they have a net worth of negative $16 trillion.  So any time they "give away" stuff, it just means they're taking money from creditors to give to other groups.

Maybe we're talking past each other.  Why do you think the legal and regulatory frameworks don't work?  There's almost zero inter-bank fraud.  Most of what we call fraud is marketing fraud in which an investment manager misleads consumers on the nature of the investment.  That has nothing to do with technical trust systems.  Bitcoin is equally subject to ponzi schemes as we've already seen from things like Butterfly Labs among others.
  Similarly, the corruption most people complain about regarding Wall Street are things like "too big to fail" banks that get bailed out by taxpayers, misleading mortgage products etc.  None of this has anything to do with "trust" from a technical perspective and none of it is at all addressed by bitcoin.
As for access to a private blockchain: they don't have to be centralized at all.  Just make it so joining the blockchain requires agreement of 90% of existing members. 
As for client nodes: of course every bank that's participating will have full access to the code.  I don't see why they wouldn't.

A lot of mistakes in here.  Just to pick one, the author writes: The second claim, that the locking-up of funds produces socially-beneficial price-deflation, is wishful thinking. It is not true that “less money supply is available for transactional purposes”; such a statement would describe destroyed security deposits. The only reason the validators freeze their money is to take it out later and buy something. If they wanted to reduce the money supply they’d have to destroy the money permanently.
The problem here is that the author seems unaware of the "velocity of money."  When economists discuss money, they talk about the "monetary base", which multiplied by the "velocity of money" yields what we think of as actual money: "M2."  By encouraging people to hold on to money (like by increasing real interest rates), the velocity of money falls and M2 decreases.  The fact that people will eventually spend that money is irrelevant; it is not available for spending or borrowing now.  If demand for money is unchanged and supply is reduced, the price of money must rise.

Strange straw man. I said it was a mistake to reject change simply because it's change.  That sounds stupidly obvious, but many people on this forum and a few core devs disagree.  
Let me frame it honestly: there are problems with bitcoin that almost everyone acknowledges, and there are interesting features being born in other altcoins and in other FinTechs.  My argument is simply that whatever you think Bitcoin *should* do from a philosophical perspective, from an economic perspective at least some of the innovations will have to be adopted and problems dealt with or bitcoin *will* fail from obsolescence.  The best way to deal with the problems and the correct innovations to adopt is the separate discussion.

Your comments and links in no way contradict mine.  
I said those non-mining nodes have no economic impact on users or miners.  You responded by saying those non-mining nodes have a network security and "definition" impact.
If we combine ourtwo non-overlapping statements we arrive at this conclusion:  In the event that economically important full nodes and miners adopted fork A and most other full nodes adopted fork B, then fork A would be fairly centralized definitionally and have low network security (because nodes could be attacked easily), while fork B would have low network security (because 51% attacks would be easy), long confirmation times, and less economic value because it would be hard to buy/sell/spend bitcoins.
Realistically, most bitcoin users just want to be able to use their bitcoins and they want their bitcoins to be valuable.  They might fear that bigger blocks would result in 5000 full nodes dropping to 4000, or they might think that bigger blocks would facilitate adoption that would increase full node count to 6000, but either way, the user is likely to join the dominant fork that lets them buy/sell/spend their bitcoins.  A huge percentage of casual bitcoin users have some or all of their coins on services like Coinbase and will "go with the flow."

Your request suggests a fundamental misunderstanding that I tried to explain.  There are generally no primary sources for sales that were never made, for businesses that were never born etc.  If you do a little searching, it won't take you long to find quotes from primary sources saying that long and indefinite confirmation times and fees are why many specific businesses have chosen not to accept bitcoin.  
And again, OB is launching and the sidechains don't exist.
As for looking forward to sidechains and LN - these are indefinitely far off.  As we all know from other types of software releases, timelines for releases are often off by a factor of 2 or more.
Do a google search for "companies partnering with ethereum" or "companies partnering with ripple" and you'll get some sense of how companies look forward.

It's not quite a binary.  We all want both decentralization and mass adoption.  It's a question of relative value.  We'd all give up a tiny bit of decentralization (say the node count dropping by 10%), if it meant quadrupling the user base.  Gavin places more weight on adoption than, say, Maxwell.
I'd also note that decentralization can be viewed in a broader context.  Personally, I think whether the node count is at 5k or 3k, or 8k is relatively trivial.  Any big government can still shutdown bitcoin any time they want, because it's still way too small.  The best way to decentralize bitcoin and make it more government resistant is to massively increase everything - the user base, the hash power, the number of nodes, the number of developer teams etc.  
@_date: 2016-03-23 21:35:01
I think almost everyone accepts that long-term scaling of a decentralized bitcoin requires sidechains or LN.  I don't oppose the idea of RBF once an alternative exists (like a sidechain with 30 second confirmation times for example).  The whole debate mostly comes down to timing.  I'm opposed to encouraging fees to rise and to RBF when bitcoin users only way to avoid these things currently is to abandon bitcoin and use other Fintech.  Once bitcoin-connected solutions exist (like LN), I'd be fine with having them.
Speaking very practically, I've talked with people at Open Bazaar and other bitcoin startups.  And they're worried that their business model may require that they use a different crypto because of these short-term issues.  We don't want to force the rise of serious competitors.
@_date: 2016-03-21 21:27:19
Miners follow a similar consensus process on these issues to core developers.  The miners meet frequently at roundtables, trade emails and phone calls constantly etc.  You can see the evolving consensus quite transparently.  6 months ago most miners were calling for an immediate hard fork to 8 mb, which they backed away from when it was clear Core wouldn't support it.  Then a few months ago when Classic was pitching the 2 MB hard fork miners wanted, there was a "testing out period" where miners voiced cautious public support for classic but said they would only support classic's hard fork if such a hard fork was consensus.
It sounds strange to say, "I will only support X if most other people do too", and most other people say the same thing.  How does this get resolved?  In practice it's not that hard.  It's iterative.  Exchanges and miners continue making public and private statements and they gradually find their way to consensus.

Stocks already corrected 15%; they're roughly fair based on historical P/E and P/B ratios, maybe moderately overpriced if you take interest rates into account.
Banks won't pass the cost on to consumers because it's only a cost if they leave that money as cash.  Instead they can use it to buy US treasuries.  Also, while banks have more deposits than they know what to do with, they make money off ancillary fees and so want to keep their customers.

Not a great analogy.  That quote would apply if people were opposing upgrading all cryptos.  No one in the crypto discussion is opposed to upgrading cryptos in general.  The question is whether bitcoin will be left behind if it fails to upgrade fast enough.  
The equivalent in the biotech world would be the following conversation among Monsanto's board of directors A: "if we genetically engineer crops in this particular way it will increase food yield and save lives but it might also have some negative effects."  And B responds: farmers are demanding higher yielding and drought resistant crops.  If we don't give it to them, someone else will.  So this isn't a question of whether drought-resistant genetically engineered crops will proliferate - they will - but whether Monsanto should be the one selling those seeds.

You seem to have misread or misunderstood parts of my post.  I said that bitcoin could **not** be replaced with ETH because ETH is far too underdeveloped.  ETH is mostly just an idea at this point, maybe a good one, maybe bad I have no idea.  I traded 1 BTC for ETH via shapshift 4 months ago, then turned it back into bitcoin a few weeks ago when ETH spiked, then again bought about 1 BTC worth when ETH collapsed back down to 3.50/USD.  I meant to sell at around 12/USD (since it again felt frothy to me) but missed the timing.  TLDR: I'm not an ETH booster.  I just scalped it as a speculative trader.
   I said that bitcoin could be replaced very quickly with something like one of the many alts in the space and gave an example of several, tossing in ETH just because it has a lot of attention and development at the moment.  One last time - ETH is underdeveloped - its not ready for prime time and won't be for a while (if ever).  I'm not a fan of litecoin (it's basically just a copy of bitcoin with no added value) and don't own any litecoin, but litecoin (or another fork of bitcoin) could be adopted very quicky by current bitcoin users, miners, and exchanges.
You also seem to have failed to understand my point about incentives.  **For any one user, their choice to adopt SegWit or not has minimal effect on network congestion.  It's like voting in an election.  Your one vote simply doesn't matter.  In contrast, if bitcoin transactions suddenly stopped working for some reason, users and companies would have a huge incentive to switch to something that worked immediately.**
For this reason - people would and could adopt a bitcoin alternative quickly if bitcoin cased to function, but those same people won't necessarily rush to adopt SegWit for the same reason most people don't vote.

A few differences.  1. Armstrong profits from the strength of the bitcoin community.  His incentives are roughly aligned with most bitcoin users.  Adam Back's business model is to profit by consulting on private blockchains, and possibly to profit from the LN network (something that is specifically more viable the less effective the bitcoin blockchain is for transactions).  His incentives are not so clearly aligned.  
Second, Armstrong is a minority voice.  I invite discussion from all parties.  I get concerned when one party seems to be drowning out the others.

As for consensus - there's nothing magical about it.  It's already in practice in many places.  Just do a google search for "consensus in databases" or "integrity management" in databases.  The question is if PoW is a meaningful improvement over existing methods.  I think PoW *is* better when dealing with hundreds of thousands of parties, but is miserably inefficient and inferior when you only need consensus between, say, 30 parties.

Ah, so you don't even know how RBF works.
As the sender of a transaction, you have no control over whether RBF will be available, because RBF is opt-in from the perspective of the receiver.  If the company or person you're sending the transaction to does not opt-in for RBF (and most have not), then you can't RBF.
Of course Core could remove the opt-in nature and try to force everyone to accept RBF, but then that makes theft quite easy.

80%+ of the bitcoin ecosystem wants it.  The vast majority of miners and nodes and companies have said they want 2 MB immediately.  But, they don't want to potentially damage the bitcoin ecosystem by encouraging a political war.  So they've all openly **begged** core devs to implement a 2 MB hard fork.
Here's the thing: almost everyone wants a 2 MB hard fork, and almost no one wants to piss off the core devs.  So what everyone wants is for the core devs to implement the 2MB hard fork. A large percentage of these people will accept no 2 MB hard fork rather than the alternative of supporting a competing development team.

There's a natural push-pull between fees and transactions.  If fees were at $1 for example, I'd wager that transaction volume would fall by 95% almost immediately.  Bitcoin would simply be abandoned for some use cases (like low priced legal transactions), some people would start using cheaper altcoins, while others would consolidate transactions in various ways.  
Overall, fees can't increase that much, because there are too many viable alternatives to bitcoin.  
@_date: 2016-03-11 22:55:59
This isn't quite accurate.  With a $0.05 fee, users are frequently left waiting indefinitely for confirmations.  I personally had a transaction with a $0.08 sit unconfirmed for 2 hours last week.  I don't think you can call transactions "supported" that have indefinite confirmation times.  That's not usable for many merchants and consumers.

While credit card fraud is indeed rampant, your name is attached to it.  Searching through CCTV records is rarely done - very time consuming, low probability of a match.  Police don't bother looking for small thefts usually.
Consider people who want to use bitcoin to buy electronic products for small dollar amounts.  Like, let's say I want to purchase a particular article or ebook or song.  We're talking small dollar amounts; $0.50 to $15.  0-confirmation transactions were perfect for this before RBF; the risk of a double spend attack by miners for such tiny dollar amounts is zero.  But with RBF suddenly there's a major risk.

Buying low and selling high is sometimes called investing, sometimes called smart trading.  It actually *reduces* market volatility.  It's the opposite of a pump and dump.  It provides liquidity to the market and helps support the market when its weak and helps avoid bubbles since you're selling into froth.

No, it's actually neither a democracy nor a meritocracy.  "Voting" does not imply democracy.  In a democracy, it's 1 vote per person.  In Bitcoin, the "voting" is effectively performed by economically important full nodes and miners in accordance with the former's importance and the latter's hash power.  
An example might help you understand.  Let's say the 10 biggest bitcoin exchanges, the 5 biggest bitcoin companies, and 80% of miners all decided to fork to 4 MB blocks immediately.  What would happen?  Well, anyone who objected to the fork would be left with coins they couldn't sell (no exchanges), and couldn't transfer efficiently (confirmation times of 3+ hours), on a heavily insecure network (easily 51% attacked).  So everyone would effectively be forced on to the 4 MB fork or accept that their coins just lost almost all their value.  
Bitcoin is in no way a meritocracy.  There is nothing to force people to adopt the "best" ideas.  In contrast, every entity in the bitcoin universe has competing economic incentives, and what's best for miners, or best for big companies like Coinbase, or best for exchanges, or best for Blockstream isn't necessarily best for the other entities.  
Then there's also the issue of "consensus."  In practice, the best idea will rarely be adopted because it will be unattractive to at least one major constituency (i.e. miners).  What ends up getting adopted is the solution that is least unacceptable.  Call it a consensus-ocracy if you will, in which the "votes" go primarily according to economic importance and hash power.  There is also a populist element however.  Core's power doesn't derive from anything objective in bitcoin so much as psychological authority; a large percentage of the bitcoin ecosystem trust the core team and want them to keep developing, and so Core is an important constituency that needs to be added to the economically important full-nodes and miners.

Most large bitcoin companies have argued that increasing capacity is important for them to be able to grow their businesses.  "Hysteria" is because we are quickly reaching a point of uncertainty and potential tail risks, similar to a hard fork.  No one is entirely certain what happens if the mempool becomes consistently overloaded.  It may increase centralization by forcing out lower capacity nodes for example.  It may produce extreme fee volatility and that delays many "legitimate" transactions despite using "smart wallets."
@_date: 2016-03-21 17:45:18
I find it incredibly compelling.  "Tricking" non-upgraded nodes into validating all transactions is antithetical to bitcoin.  I would much prefer a transparent hard fork to that kind of sneak attack on nodes.
@_date: 2016-03-07 18:05:59
You seem to misunderstand how SegWit increases capacity.  As an individual (or a single company) you can't control how fast other people will adopt it.  So you and I may want it to double capacity, but it simply won't.  It'll increase capacity by &lt;10% on the first day, and maybe 50% over the next few months. This isn't disputed (although no one knows the exact numbers. All the core devs have admitted this will produce minimal capacity increases in the first few weeks.  Most full node operators are "passive."  Many won't even know that a new release is out for a couple weeks.
Two types of problems: technical and economic.
Technical: people are routinely facing 2+ hour confirmation times when congestion surges.  Even worse is the volatility and uncertainty.  I placed a transaction with a $.09 fee last week and it took over an hour to confirm.  If we don't know when or if a transaction will confirm, we're less likely to rely on bitcoin and more likely to use some competing option to store wealth or conduct trade.  The huge increase in the mempool also causes some nodes to fail.  It increases centralization the same way that increasing the block size might; you force out those nodes that have trouble handling a 40mb+ mempool.  As a very concrete example - I've created bitcoin converts by offering to pay them back for beer in bitcoin.  Those people then went on to use bitcoin as a store of value and bought tens of thousands of dollars worth.  How can I offer to pay someone $10 in bitcoin when I have no idea if my transaction will even go through?  Or I could slap a $0.50 fee on it to guaranty it'll go through, but then when my friend asked how much did you have to pay to transfer and I answer 5%, he'll scrunch up his nose and never think about bitcoin again.
There are tons of general media articles written in the last 2 weeks writing bitcoin off as a failure.  Sure, current bitcoin users might know better, but if we want bitcoin to succeed long term, we care about new users.  We may have permanently lost tens of thousands of potential bitcoin users and developers and entrepreneurs.  Some of those people may turn to alternatives like litecoin or etherium or dash, dramatically eroding bitcoin's lead in the crypto race.  In 10 years I'm convinced there will be a meaningful cryptocurrency in the world, but we've substantially reduced the odds that it will be bitcoin.  We're *forcing* people to abandon bitcoin in favor of other cryptos if they want to get their transactions predictably confirmed.  We may remember this as the moment that, say, etherium began its path to eventually render bitcoin obsolete.  Consider the analogy to Friendster.  Friendster was the first and only big social network for a time.  It had a huge moat and economies of scale.  Then they failed to scale properly and users faced major delays.  So users started looking around for alternatives and found tiny Myspace.  Myspace quickly ballooned and Friendster's competitive advantage of having a much bigger network disappeared.  The rest is history.

But bitcoin is so much more than computer code.  It's also a business ecosystem, an economic tool, a censorship resistant communications tool, etc.
The right technical choices depend partly on your vision for bitcoin's economic/political/business/communications future, and this is part of the blocksize debate.
Let me take an extreme hypothetical.  Let's imagine that evil forces could destroy bitcoin by DDOSing every full node.  And let's imagine that it would cost them $5 billion to do this attack if there are 5,000 full nodes, and $3 billion to do this if there are 3,000 full nodes.  Now let's also assume that if we accept the smaller full node count, we could triple the positive impact of bitcoin, triple the user base, triple the number of people who enjoy the benefits of the technology.  Would we accept that trade off?  If not, what if the node count (and corresponding DDOS attack cost) only fell to 4,000, or 4,500, or 4999?

It seems like the way you're using "merit" is actually very close to my original claim.
I claimed that bitcoin decision making is mostly decided by "votes" accorded to economically important full nodes in accordance with their importance, and to miners in accordance with their hash power.
You claimed that control is based on "merit" which is determined by what those nodes and miners are contributing to the network in terms of value.  And you equate value to users by the economically important full nodes as network value, and hash power of miners used in securing the network as network value.  So it seems like you agree almost exactly with my claim.
Where we differ is that I don't think hash power or economic importance are identical to value provided (aka merit).
@_date: 2016-03-15 22:30:23

Ethereum's latest release is like 10x the size and complexity of SegWit and getting a huge amount of engineering and venture capital investment now.  Whether it will turn out to be a meaningful technology I have no idea, but a lot of the top minds (and biggest wallets) in the crypto space think it has a lot of promise.  I could rattle off a half dozen other interesting crypto developments, but I have a feeling you'll just dismiss them all out of hand.
  But we don't have to only compare Segwit to bitcoin rivals.  Consider something like Open Bazaar.  It's like a new internet protocol, a massive undertaking, and it's almost ready for release after less than 2 years of development.  Heck, Uber went from zero to 20 million users in less time than it's taking SegWit to deploy.

No one disputes that Maxwell and Back and Luke and Pieter have influence...ask any core dev and they will happily admit that those guys have tons of influence.  Influence isn't a bad thing - we want the smartest people with the best reputations and long histories contributing to bitcoin to have influence.  The issue raised is that the influence is "centralized" within an ambiguous commercial context currently.
@_date: 2016-03-22 15:17:42
Centralization doesn't refer to the raw # of people, but rather to control.  This is why people don't like cloud hosting of full nodes.  There could be 100,000 full nodes, but if they're all hosted on 1 cloud service, there's a single point of failure and thus its centralized.
With the dev team, while we see lots of different people contributing ideas and code, ultimately there is only 1 updated version of core released.  Who decides what goes into that release?  Basically Maxwell and Back with moderate input from another half dozen people that mostly include their employees and friends.  The Core team is equivalent to having a ton of full nodes all hosted on one cloud service.
I care far more about dev centralization than mining centralization.  Miners incentives are pretty closely aligned with the general bitcoin community's and we've seen that in their actions.  Miners frequently act "altruistically" because the value of their hardware is dependent on the price of bitcoin, which depends on the health of the network.  In contrast, developers' vision for bitcoin and specific incentives can be very much at odds with large swaths of the bitcoin community.  The blockstream team has received more than $40 million in venture capital funding, an amount that totally dwarfs their bitcoin holdings.  Their vision for bitcoin and their financial success are directly opposed to the current success of most bitcoin businesses; blockstream has very explicitly said that encouraging user adoption near-term is not a priority for them.  
The hope is that this is resolved with a longer term outlook - once LN or something like it is released, incentives will be better aligned.  My fear is that the gap between now and that release is "inventing" competitors.  We've created major opportunities for competing FinTech to capture current and potential bitcoin users.
The simplest example for this are microtransactions.  Once considered one of bitcoin's potential primary use cases, the core dev team now views these as uninteresting and unfeasible for bitcoin (until LN is released.)  Open Bazaar may succeed or fail based on microtransactions and so we've forced their team to consider implementing a crypto other than bitcoin, something that can support lower fees and faster confirmations.  If Open Bazaar becomes a successful platform for microtransactions and uses some other crypto, we will have pulled a "friendster" and created a big competitor.  While bitcoin certainly can't support microtransactions long-term without LN, the question is simply what to do in this interim period.  No one doubts that the bitcoin network can easily and safely support 2 MB blocks, the question is just how many full nodes would drop off and how important such a drop off is.  In my opinion, a decrease from 5000 to 4000 full nodes is far less of an existential risk to bitcoin than the alternative that we're currently doing - which is creating unnecessary and serious competitors. 
@_date: 2016-03-23 19:10:21
I think I found your confusion.  You think individual users and full node operators matter.   They don't.  It matters not at all if 99% of full node operators install a particular client.  Their nodes are simply irrelevant.  If the 1% of nodes running some new fork happen to be the *important* ones, meaning exchanges, big businesses etc, those are all that matters.  Think about why this is.  if some random individual is running a full node on a particular fork, how does their choice effect me as a user at all?  How does their choice effect miners at all?  It doesn't.  In contrast, the exchanges' choices directly effect the miners and users by determining if and where you can sell your bitcoins.  And the nodes controlled by big bitcoin companies like Coinbase, or companies that accept payment by bitcoin effect miners and users by determining if we can spend our bitcoins.  TLDR: The only full nodes that matter are the ones that actually matter for economic reasons: primarily exchanges, but also big companies like Coinbase, and merchants like Overstock.
  As for what the broad community wants: I can hunt down public announcements from almost every single economically important full node operator and miner over the last year that they want hard fork to larger blocksize.  Adam Back himself was part of this group proposing a 2-4-8 scaling plan 9 months ago. 
   The thing is, almost all of these players wanted and still want the core team to implement the changes.  The reason most of these businesses and miners don't support Classic is a mix of 1. They don't want to create the risk of a rift in the community and the resulting economic losses that would arise, and 2. They favor the wide and deep technical expertise of core over the tiny Classic team.  
But probably the single most important point to realize is that the miners are simply following what they see as the community consensus.  The've said they want a larger blocksize but they haven't tried to force anything on anyone.  And they don't need to guess about community consensus, because again, random users don't matter.  They simply listen to explicit statements from the economically important full node operators.  If 75% of miners support Classic, it means that a superconsensus of the economically important full node operators do as well.

Ugh, you're confusing FUD with simple math.  **EVERYONE** including Adam Back and core devs agrees with the statement that if nothing is done to scale bitcoin it will fail.  That's the common starting  point.  To simply refuse to accept the simple math behind the mempool is trolling.  Don't troll.
The question is how and when to scale.  Just as many people have written long essays about the possible uncertainties surrounding a hard fork, we can *and must* think about the uncertainties surrounding too slow a scaling approach.  I can link to a half dozen core dev quotes on this topic if you want.  
As for Segwit - you seem genuinely confused about the technology.  All of SegWit's creators talk very openly about how the scaling it provides comes directly from adoption, and they estimate adoption will be gradual.  Take a look right now at which version of Core most nodes are running - a huge percentage are running versions from more than a year ago.  All the technical experts disagree with you - they all say SegWit will not be instantly adopted by everyone.  
Then you confuse SegWit (which provides no incentive for adoption by full node operators) with other alternatives.  When SegWit is released, someone passively running a full node has no pressing reason to rush to upgrade.  In contrast, when the bitcoin network is extremely congested, companies like bitpay, coinbase, darknet markets etc, all have a *huge* incentive to adopt something that will keep them in business immediately.  Etherium is not an option currently - its still too underdeveloped.  Litecoin might be an option.  Some darknet markets already accept Dash, but I don't know anything about that network to be honest.
My only altcoin investment is that I own 100 ETH, more of a trading position.  My position in bitcoin is approximately 60x as large as my ETH one.  Believe it not, I don't care.  But don't say that my quoting of core devs and simply repeating the consensus of technical experts is FUD.
Bitcoin doesn't need shills like yourself.  Complacency might be the biggest threat to bitcoin.

The way any complex system works is that only a tiny minority of the community will have the time/skill to fully evaluate every detail. How many people read every line of code in each new Core release? Even if we have the skill to do so, we lack the time. And of course, most of us lack the skill to fully understand every line of code and its possible effects.
And even if we understood every line of code, how many of us can correctly interrupt the economic and psychological effects of code changes on the community? Even the top core devs are struggling with this part.
So, the community is forced to trust our "representatives" on the details. And we place our trust based partly on character.

I partially agree, but there's a middle ground.  Bitcoin could readily handle another few transactions a second easily.  The only people who can't are a small number of full node operators running the equivalent of AOL dial-up.  A moderate increase in blocksize would buy time for things like LN to be built without driving potential bitcoin users away to competing Fintech.  The worst case scenario is that while bitcoin is working on its settlement layer, we lose a bunch of current and potential users and create a serious competitor out of something like Ripple or DASH or some alt or other fintech I've never heard of.

First, Gavin is one dude.  Miners, nodes, exchanges, and big bitcoin companies all begged for an upgrade.
Second, your link supports my point - Gavin begged for *even more* than 2 MB.  2 MB was the eventual compromise, and even then Core wouldn't compromise.
Lastly, SegWit, *still* isn't ready for release, even when we know we'd be facing these problems 6 months ago.  And no, SegWit doesn't double capacity.  According to core devs, on day 1 it won't be more than a 10% increase.  It will take months for it to be a 50% increase in capacity.  *eventually* it may be a 1.7x to 2x increase.

You think a DNM market would adopt a fork that had 40+ minute confirmation times, was susceptible to 51% attacks, that &lt;25% of bitcoiners were using, and that few exchanges accepted?  Seriously?  
The 40+ minute confirmation time would last 2016 blocks = a bare minimum of 56 days, probably lots longer if more than 75% of miners went to the other fork.
You keep referring to the "real economy" but individual bitcoin users who don't run full nodes don't matter.  The average localbitcoiner and darknet user doesn't care and has no "vote" on this issue.  What matters are the "economically important" full nodes, and that's basically a dozen full nodes:  Coinbase, Bitpay, and a few other big companies (Xapo, Circle, etc), the biggest 4 exchanges, and the biggest 3 DNMs or so.  That's it.  If you get a supermajority of that list + a supermajority of miners then there's a clearly dominant fork and the network effect immediately takes effect.  No miner wants to mine a dead fork, so the winning fork will quickly have near 100% hash power, which means the dead fork will quickly have 3+ confirmation times, making it useless to everyone else.
The network effect is super powerful here.  The vast majority of bitcoin companies, users, and miners simply want to be on the dominant fork, whatever that fork is.  Very few will make a major monetary sacrifice over blocksize or segwit complexity or whatever.

Yes, of course the inflationary impact of the block reward is a big part of what's currently funding the system.  But bringing this back to the discussion at hand - the inflationary block reward is huge and will remain huge for a long time.

I think a 51% attack is really not a big problem for a bunch of reasons.  Most importantly, miners have to make massive capital commitments to mining gear.  A successful 51% attack would likely devalue their equipment far more than they'd gain in new bitcoin.  Second, a 51% attack is really really tough.  Even if you control 60% of hash power, your odds of solving enough consecutive blocks to "lock in" your double spend is quite low.  Over weeks and weeks the odds improve, but you wouldn't know in advance when your string of 6+ solved blocks would occur, so you'd have to be trying to double spend over and over which would be noticed and prompt a response.    
  I don't understand the "smuggles across a USB stick" example.
@_date: 2016-02-25 19:17:32
"in a few decades."  This is the key point.  The block reward is huge and will be huge for 2 more halvenings, and transaction volume is still trivial compared to where we hope it will be in 10 years.
@_date: 2016-02-25 19:26:48
Almost all of this is true and valid.  My biggest objection is to having our hands forced.  It's incredibly unhealthy long-term for bitcoin's development to be so thoroughly centralized and controlled by 15 people.

The problem is that people are relying on LN's existence and specific features to solve lots of pressing problems. Those assumptions are driving decisions being made today.  That concerns some of us, because we don't want to see calamity, if for example, LN is delayed by 6 months.

Wrong.  
Satoshi put the cap in place when it was 500x transaction volume and said it should be raised when needed.

Security yes.  No to stability.
 Obviously most bitcoin holders would prefer large price appreciation to price stability.  
Most bitcoin users want to see the network scale to allow for more transactions (via segwit or larger block cap or whatever) rather than stability in that regard.
Every new release of core includes numerous improvements and changes.  We much prefer that to stability.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:52:38
I partially agree.  Part of it comes down to how we think about incentives, politics, and vision for bitcoin.
There's an interesting psychological phenomena in which people tend to have the same views as their colleagues and bosses within specific industries.  Some of this comes from self-selection (i.e. what kind of person goes into investment banking.)  Some of it comes from exposure (i.e. if you're around the water cooler all day with libertarians, you're more likely to be convinced by their arguments).  And some of it comes from incentives (i.e. if I know that all my customers, bosses, and colleagues hate Obama, I know it's in my interest to be a republican, I'm more likely to be a republican.)  The combination of the last two means that while most people aren't malicious - they are driven by things that are functionally malicious to those who disagree with the outcome.  For example, the vast majority of investment bankers favor lower taxes on the rich.  Most will say this isn't for selfish reasons, they just think lower taxes on the rich is good for the country.  The line between honestly believing this, lying to themselves to believe it, and explicitly lying to outsiders is blurred.   
How does all this apply?  Adam Back and his cohort have a vision for bitcoin.  They've put themselves in a position where if bitcoin moves down that path, they'll likely benefit.  Or we could frame it the opposite way - they have a vision for bitcoin that arises out of their self-interest.  It's impossible to parse out the exact truth.
@_date: 2016-02-26 01:11:35
No one wants it to function as a better currency layer before LN arrives.  We just don't want to artificially function as a *worse* currency layer by suddenly imposing a brand new artificial cap.  You don't drive away users of bitcoin 1.0 until bitcoin 2.0 is ready.  The lightning network *doesn't exist.*  Driving away users and forcing them to consider competitors (other altcoins or fintech or whatever) is stupid.
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:04:19
Lol.  you so hate seeing dissenting views that you've resorted to bitching and moaning.  
Like it or not, a huge chunk of the bitcoin ecosystem opposes authoritarianism of development.  Lots of miners, exchanges, big companies, and users, want to express their opinions that they don't like the current core roadmap.  If you don't like that, stay off reddit.
@_date: 2016-02-26 01:55:11
But people *already* segregate coins based on conditions (that are not arbitrary).  For example, coinbase will shut down your account if your coins are "tainted" by a gambling or drug site.  Other institutions that face similar AML laws are likely to do the same.
Your hard currency example doesn't really work for a few reasons.  First, while banks do indeed check serial numbers against a database of known thefts, most people don't.  There's never been a way for a random merchant to check if the particular currency you're presenting them is "important" by serial number.  Not so for bitcoin.  Anyone and everyone can easily perform taint analysis with automated and free tools.  
Also, while hard currency is indeed at least somewhat distinguishable, electronic currency literally isn't.  If I do an ACH transfer from Bank A to bank B, and then into my online broker, that broker cannot distinguish the incoming digital cash from any other incoming digital cash. The *only* thing they can possibly know about that cash is the immediate source.  Which means it's comically easy to "anonymize" digital fiat.  In contrast, it's incredibly hard to anonymize BTC.
@_date: 2016-02-26 22:12:47
"we" the bitcoin community.  How do you think decision making works for bitcoin?  You know there's no committee or dictator right?
"Who's estimate? I'm in no position to be estimating these sorts of things. I have to rely on people with technical expertise. My confidence is in them (those I trust)."  The people working on LN themselves say they don't know when it will be done, and just have a rough estimate.  Trust them when they say they don't know when it will come out.  You can also trust your basic understanding of software development, that long-term timetables are very frequently prone to delays.
The concern of fees rising is that it creates an immediate and powerful incentive for people to use a competitor like 1. Dash, 2. It destroys numerous use cases like micropayments that may well work with LN; by making these use cases impossible for bitcoin for an unforseeable amount of time, we strongly discourage their development.
@_date: 2016-02-26 15:10:07
This is factually incorrect.  If a bank closes your account, they have to give you your money.  The exact timing and requirements are detailed in the document: Federal Reserve Compliance and Regulation CC
If they fail to give you your money promptly, they are first liable for regulatory fees and fines and ultimately their executives will be in prison for theft.  
@_date: 2016-02-26 21:31:20
They're using the term hyperbolically.  We're making major decisions to postpone scaling today on the assumption that LN will solve these problems in 9-12 months.  That's a huge assumption along several axes, especially the release time.  Unlike with building a new school, the confidence in our estimate of how long it will take is far far lower.
Of course these problems can effect government programs to.  Infrastructure projects routinely go 5x over budget and past schedule.  When that risk appear substantial, government implement temporary immediate solutions.  
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:04:52
This is totally untrue.  Every time I've sent a transaction with less than $.05 it sits in limbo indefinitely.  A few weeks ago I sent transaction with a $.07 fee and it still sat unconfirmed for 2 hours.

If you want bitcoin to succeed you *have* to be impatient.  Technologies evolve quickly or become obsolete quickly.  Consider friendster.  They failed because while their consumer base exploded, they added servers too slowly.  So users left for myspace.  We don't want to see bitcoin fail the same way.  So we can wait patiently for LN *as long as we don't force away consumers in the mean time.*

Yea, why won't the bitcoin community just give up on near-term scaling solutions?  Why won't the big bitcoin companies and miners and Gavin just let bitcoin die already?
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:26:10
We're in general agreement.  I think some flexibility about the "social contract" element of the protocol is important though.  Like, the centralization of mining is bad and was unforeseen by Satoshi.  If someone came up with a way to edit the protocol to mitigate that, it'd probably be a good thing.
As for a 2 MB hardfork, it's arguably more in keeping with stable protocol.  We all know the 1 MB was put in by Satoshi with the intention of it being way over the # of real transactions.  It was meant to prevent spam, not create a fee market.  You could argue that raising the cap to prevent rising fees is more in keeping with stability.  
Regardless, I think the greatest risk to bitcoin is "stability."  Bitcoin has great first mover advantage and network effects.  But if some altcoin comes out with a major innovation that represents a genuine large improvement, and bitcoin fails to adopt the improvement in a timely manner, it will definitely be left in the dust.  The analogy I like in this regard is friendster-&gt;myspace-&gt;facebook.
@_date: 2016-02-26 18:10:22
Once again you're wrong.  People aren't "trying" to use BTC as a currency.  They **are** using it as a currency.  Silk Road, Amazon, Microsoft etc.  Honestly, why do you keep repeating the same obviously  incorrect things?  What are you trying to prove?  Do you think you're going to fool people into forgetting that they themselves have used BTC as a currency?  Just about everyone on this forum has personally used BTC as a currency.
@_date: 2016-02-22 21:52:17
This is incorrect.  In your scenario, where the very people who originally made up the 75% supporting the switch change their mind, the entire network would simply be on the 1 MB chain.  The new 2 MB chain wouldn't have any support.  The math here is simple.  The 1 MB chain would have: the ~25% of its original supporters + the new converts + everyone who sees that the 2MB chain isn't the longest chain and no longer has support.
The key idea here is that almost everyone wants to have bitcoins that have value.  Almost all miners want to be able to earn meaningful rewards for mining.  Almost all merchants want to receive BTC that have value.  So almost everyone jumps on the winning chain, whichever one that is.
@_date: 2016-02-26 15:11:24
It's related to fungibility via the "jumps."  With hard cash or digital cash, if the illegal activity is 2 steps removed from the bank, they have know way of knowing.  With bitcoin, the coins aren't fungible.  Rather, they're traceable indefinitely, and so even after 10 jumps, coinbase can say you violated their terms of service.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:47:13
This is not correct.  Only the merchant needs to validate my transaction, and *any* miner can mine it.  It doesn't matter if 90% of miners refuse to mine it.  I'm not trusting any particular miner.
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:00:18
Not really.  This scaling problem is purely because of the great firewall.  Without that, the bitcoin network could easily handle 4 MB today.  Most full nodes can handle 4 MB.  The argument for 1MB is that we don't want to lose the nodes that can't upgrade.
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:12:45

The information is public.  That's what the blockchain is.  *EVERYONE* who you transact bitcoin with can track you for infinite hops.  If you don't like that, don't use bitcoin.  Or use a mixer.  Whether coinbase specifically makes use of that public information or not is a separate question, unrelated to privacy.  The information is non-private as soon as you transact using BTC.

New technologies evolve or die.  Consider friendster to myspace to facebook.  Bitcoin can (and has been) replicated in hundreds of altcoins.

All of that looks great. But I'm skeptical that any of that will deal with the core problem (pardon my pun) of people viewing differences of opinion as conspiracy attacks and responding with censorship, DOS attacks, and scorched earth tactics.  At some point, there will be some other fundamental "innovation" that much of the bitcoin community thinks is critical for bitcoin to adopt in a timely manner.  I'm terrified that the oligopoly will veto that innovation and effectively render bitcoin obsolete.
I haven't heard any suggestions by anyone to improve mining centralization.  But...I don't view that as an existential problem (since miners have no incentive to mess with bitcoin and limited power to do so).  I view it as a technical one (i.e. what if the great firewall breaks and chinese miners are cut off from the network and block confirmation times go up 3x).

Commit access is irrelevant; the diversity of views can come from client releases.  Some of us just want to be able to continue using bitcoin without watching it stagnate from an arbitrary cap that was never meant to stop legitimate transaction volume.  My only politics is this: I want bitcoin to succeed for selfish reasons (I own a ton) and for moral reasons (I'm libertarian and think bitcoin is good for the world.)  I happen to believe that bitcoin is sure to succeed *unless* we stifle it.  Almost everyone (including Classic developers) would like nothing more than to see the Core Devs run the show as long as they are reflecting the innovations taht we want.  If Core adds a 2 MB upgrade, I'd love to keep installing their client.

This is incorrect.  Every bitcoin is actually totally unique.  For example, I can say, "I will buy bitcoins that are mined in China for $600 each, and bitcoins mined in the US for $400 each, and bitcoins that have been transferred 30 times for $500 each."  You can't do this with fiat, because there's no "history" of fiat.

This is incorrect.  Segwit by soft fork has a nearly identical effect to a hard fork on decentralization and security.  It works specifically by tricking the non-upgraded full nodes into validating all new transactions.  A hard fork (in which the non-upgraded full nodes know they're no longer successfully validating) is far safer and secure.
Soft forks can be implemented in many ways, some safe, some not.  Hard forks can be implemented in many ways, some safe some not.  Treating it as a simple dichotomy is misleading at best.

All bitcoin exchanges contain a wallet.  Listing a wallet on their site isn't a problem.  The point is that as a company, the wallet is not their main offering.  People shouldn't be using coinbase *for* its wallet.  But the wallet is kind of necessary for the exchange functionality.

@_date: 2016-02-24 16:12:20
This is again incorrect.  It's just simple logic.  What is the block confirmation time of a chain with less than 25% mining support?  At least 4x as long.  What is the value of a bitcoin on a minority chain that most exchanges don't support?  A small fraction of the majority chain.  
Basically, the "losing" chain very quickly becomes a huge loser in terms of confirmation time, security (since the majority could attack the smaller chain easily at any time), and bitcoin price.  As such, a chain that is losing slightly (like with 40% support) will very quickly lose almost all support.

Second, Coinbase isn't Apple.  Apple is supermassive with lobbying clout and millions of customers who support them and will write their congressmen on Apple's behalf.  Coinbase is a flea in comparison.  
Third, bitcoin is young and *hopefully* growing.  Do we really want Coinbase to be making lots of fanfare saying, "our customers demand a right to move BTC to gambling and drug sites without being tracked!"  Do we really want that to be the big headline around bitcoin in the US?  Is that the way we want to draw legislator's attention to bitcoin when they're hearing about it for the first or second time?

The conspiracy arises from the ordering.  Most of the community wanted to increase the block cap now while we wait for SegWit and LN.  But blockstream and core devs blocked that.  Maxwell explicitly said he wanted fees to rise to increase demand for LN.  So it looks to many people like these core devs are "sabotaging" bitcoin to promote LN.  I put sabotaging in quotes, because they certainly don't see it that way - they see LN as necessary for the long-term success of bitcoin.  But many disagree and the community doesn't like being forced this way.

"No scalability solution exists, that's the issue at hand."
Actually code to scale the network for another 6-12 months worth of transaction growth was coded more than 5 years ago.  Satoshi discussed it. Adam Back recommended it in August of 2015.  The current version of this code takes us to 2 MB blocks and it could be implemented immediately and easily.

You can also help form consensus (or at least the appearance of it) through moderation, threats, and DOS attacks.

Lol, so you're trying to argue that lots of people use BTC as money, but not currency?  
I work in economics so I'm quite familiar with the common definitions of both.  You should know that your statement, "Currency is necessarily money, but money is not necessarily currency" is neither right nor wrong.  It's a stylized sentence requiring very specific definitions of each.  For example, one definition of "currency" by Merriam-Webster is: "Something that is used as money."  If you're trying to make a particular point about currency, then make it.  You're losing the semantic game.

If you don't upgrade, your node is falsely validating all Segwit txs.  To many bitcoin users, that's far worse than a hard fork.  I'd much rather a node be kicked off the grid (in which case its operator knows and is likely to choose to upgrade), than to have the node silently tricked into false validation.
I don't see the "mayhem" issue.  All discussed hard forks have at least a month of warning.  Let's say after that time, 20% of hard nodes fail to upgrade, so full node count falls from 5500 to 4300 or whatever.  Sure that sucks, but it's not mayhem.  And you'd likely see most of those node operators upgrading over the next month or two when they get around to it.

They are?  If banking cartels wanted to destroy bitcoin, it would be gone.  They could just monopolize mining with a $5 billion investment, or more easily, hire a handful of the top core devs, employ them by one company, and just control bitcoins' development.  Oh wait, you think they did that already?

When people first hear about bitcoin, they tend to think of bitcoins as individual "things."  Eventually people understand that bitcoins are unspent transaction outputs, totally inseparable from the blockchain.  The distinction between the network and bitcoins is useful for discussion, but doesn't support your point.
Contrary to your statements, people are using both bitcoin **and** Bitcoin for currency purposes.  The Silk Road, Amazon, Dell, and the majority of transactions on the Bitcoin network are transmitting BTC as currency.  Your semantic games don't even mitigate your wrongness.  I'll say it again: the majority of bitcoin movement over the Bitcoin network is for currency purposes.  People buying drugs on darknet or buying computers from Dell are using bitcoins on the Bitcoin network as currency.

I *wish* that were true.  But we've seen the truth.  When someone creates their own code and tries to encourage the community to adopt it, they get censored on this forum, publicly shamed and insulted by core devs, the nodes that adopt the code get DOS attacked, core threatens to change the POW algorithm to put the miners who adopt it out of business, etc, etc.

Of course.  Except the block reward is still gigantic and will be for a decade.
@_date: 2016-02-24 18:19:22
Funny thing about incentives...people tend to see things the same way as the person who signs their monthly pay checks.
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:12:57
Exactly.   The inflationary block reward is huge and will remain huge for a long time. Fees will be a trivial portion of miners' reward until transaction volume is at least 10x where it is now. Transaction volume can't grow 10x if we drive away users.
@_date: 2016-02-25 15:20:23
The 1MB was set at 500x the transaction volume and satoshi said it should be raised in the future when needed.  What aren't you understanding?  What else would a limit 500x above transaction volume apply for?  This isn't rocket science or even critical thinking.  Just connect the two super simple dots the only way they can be connected.

I think bitcoin is being pretty thoroughly governed by the core dev team at the moment.  The protocol is created by them and updated by them.  Attempts at the contrary result not only in failure to gain broad acceptance, but in censorship, public shaming, DOS attacks, and scorched earth tactics.

In the US, there are very tough anti-money laundering laws.  Currently these are called "know your customer."  Coinbase is a US financial institution and subject to these laws.  If they want to stay in business as a US financial institution, they have to play this game.
Want to transact purely in BTC?  Don't use coinbase.  Want to easily and consistently convert fiat to BTC and back?  Coinbase is the best company I know of for that.  I don't know of anyone who can do what coinbase does, with privacy.  Privacy and fiat banks don't mix.  
It's really easy to just use coinbase to convert fiat, and then to anonymize the BTC through a mixer or a couple anonymous wallet transfers.

For P2P transfers, the competition is Venmo and Paypal, which are both free for personal transfers.  For P2B, the competition is indeed credit cards, but consumers don't see those fees typically.

Core added 2 MB to their roadmap...so have you sold your coins yet?
@_date: 2016-02-26 21:01:58
Gavin asked, begged, and pleaded with core to scale bitcoin.  He would have been more than happy for them to do it.  He only reluctantly took on the mantle when they refused the community's requests for over a year.
