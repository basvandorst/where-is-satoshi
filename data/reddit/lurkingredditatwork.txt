I'm wondering if coinbase charges you a fee for x-fering your bitcoins to circle?  Doesn't make sense to pay that fee on coinbase when you can do it for free on circle.

Currently using Bitcoin Core version v0.12.1 (64-bit), so you're suggesting I should downgrade to 0.12?

Damn, I'm wondering if this is a coinbase issue or blockchain network issue.

Paying 1% fees with who?
@_date: 2016-06-17 16:24:54
There are no fees if you cash out to your debit card or directly to your bank account

Works great, I x-ferred some bitcoins from coinbase to circle and cashed out directly to my bank without paying fees.

When it goes up that fast, a correction was bound to come.

Using bitcoin core wallet, it was set to normal, if it fails after 72 hours I'll resend using the fastest confirmation time, thanks all.

Try circle.  There's no fees when cashing out to a debit card or bank account.

Fees to xfer the money back into my bank account

Mine has been confirmed already.  It took 4 days, you might want to check your wallet and see if it's been refunded back to it?

And you know this how?
@_date: 2016-02-20 06:49:07
I didn't make any claims, you did.  I just simply asked you a question.
@_date: 2016-02-19 14:05:28
You weren't asking a question, you were stating it as a fact.

I bought in around $470, now it's at $440.... FML.

I've invested in bitcoin for the same reason as everyone else who invests in something.  I have every right to wanting to throw up when you see a $100 decline in one day.  Sure it might go higher in the future but right now I'm just wishing I bought in at $370 instead of $479.
@_date: 2015-11-04 22:49:41
I just want to throw up. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:28:53
Bought 4 @ $479.... is there any way to cancel the transaction, lol?
