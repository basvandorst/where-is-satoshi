That's not the market. That's not the forces of offer and demand in action but the acts of an oligopoly to save they're interests.

I understand where you're coming from but it seems to me your are talking about shaping the market. Moving it in the direction that you want it to move. They saved a business model that at a macro level should have failed. As to offer and demand, should be supply and demand my mistake non native English speaker, those are the only forces of the market. Everything else goes into one of those two categories. The economy would be another matter, that's composed of capital, labor, land and technology. Here we have a move by the capital to save this economic business model. To save the economy that this business model comprises by moving capital. This is not a free market move but a move of capital to save a failing business model.

I´m not so sure that this was an opportunity for profit so much as the chance to stop the implosion of the economy. Which would have been extremely damaging to their businesses. So again, these are not the forces of the market at work, this is not offer and demand. They intervened with the forces of the market to save their business model. If the forces of the market had been left on its own the business model that created that situation would have been completely destroyed. This is not capitalism, this is not the free market which i believe you are trying to defend.
