Thank Ü for the response. I actually read the sticky after I posted. I do have a question that maybe you could answer. 
If I bought 100 or so Bitcoins, would they be worth more in the coming years?

So why get into bitcoins? Excuse my ignorance but I thought it was like an alternative currency?

Thank Ü for answering the mining question! That is not the route I will be taking...I barely have a Dell desktop. It's still interesting. If Ü don't mind me asking, what made Ü get into Bitcoins initially?

Interesting. I just broke even on the 250 I put in 2 years ago. Iknow the next 4 years will be awesome.
