Why do the top 20% of Bitcoin holders have as much Bitcoin as they do? Did they work for their bitcoin? Did their bitcoin come from payment for a service? Did they generate revenue in some way? What did they do to accumulate that Bitcoin?

You're still murdering that sweet innocent animal. What's ethical about that, exactly? And for what? Breakfast? Can't imagine a greater selfishness.

Spending by the top 20% of bitcoin users will be spending targeted to the interests of the top 20% (largely technophile interests).
This contrains bitcoin growth by concentrating bitcoin payment processing to a small list of vendors (for example tigerdirect). If you distributed 20% of all bitcoin to people all over the world they would use it to initiate new markets and new services to spend bitcoin with.

i.e. it's a pyramid scheme.

Hi again,
I know this isn't what you're on reddit for, but this is an example of what I was talking about:
* A specific warning message doesn't overstate the threat (like a scammer would try to do)
* The buttons are smaller and more proportional to their text (oversized buttons are a hallmark of ads, adware, and malware because it tries to get you to click it accidentally)
* The red warning color has been desaturated to be more in line with the saturation of MalwareByte's classic ocean blue tone (beautiful, btw!)
* The button green now matches the lower left green, also simplifying the color palette
* The HUGE oversized lower-left scan button is replaced with quick-shortcuts to common scan requests.
Again, all of this serves to present MBAM as a scanner that has a variety of measures for a variety of threats, that it understands specifically what's wrong with your computer (you haven't scanned yet, we've detected a malware, you have not updated, etc). The original 2.0 GUI portrays MBAM as a "hit green button fix problem" with its language and poor message specificity.
My GUI edits still function like that but inform the user as to what they're doing (which is what a *legitimate* software does).
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:02:21


The messages should be *specific*, regardless of what they say.
When real-time is not enabled it says "Your system is not fully protected" when it should say "Real-time is not enabled."


There's nothing wrong with how it looks objectively - the problem is with its connotations. It references design cues used by fake AV malware.


It was completely bland and used Windows 98 GUI design, which said "I'm utilitarian and I'm who I say I am."
Flashiness implies showiness implies that you have *something to prove to the user...* Scale down the flash 10% and it'll look great.

I made the original offhand comment as a way of just throwing some internal attention to it.
I am *not* picky with GUI's, but I really believe that MBAM's future may be compromised by its current GUI. It shares far too many characteristics with fake scam AV scanners (overly large super-colorful buttons, a big "YOU ARE SAFE" message in a bright red box.
I get that customers complained about the simplicity but you should have the company do a review of what fake AV scanners tend to look like.
It's a problem when the viruses you're aiming to remove have the same GUI as a virus scam. Keeping things bright and colorful yet professional is a fine line to walk but all other antivirus scanners have managed to walk it just fine.
Use of color should be tactful and no more than 2 colors should be used. MBAM has 3 colors and all 3 of them are primary colors...
These two small changes should do the job:
* Drop the red background color for the "fix it" warning - perhaps make it less saturated
* Reduce the font size on the green buttons
The non-dashboard pages look great otherwise.

If that's the case, why is tigerdirect the only major vendor accepting bitcoin?


Why are they doing that? What's their motivation? Bitcoin operates on the principles of a pyramid scheme: that's a fact. It doesn't necessarily mean it is a scam (it's more of a scheme), but it certainly has a sucker in its equation.
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:26:58
Thoughts on the new GUI in 2.0? Whose goofy idea was that lol? [Looks like an adware program from the mid-2000s.](
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:07:49
Bitcoins spent are bitcoins received. Services and goods are exchanged .. How does that not force adoption onto the providers of those services and goods?
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:19:04
Sounds like it makes sense to me. What will a random user do with 3 bitcoin? Spend it in the economy - forcing adoption.
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:45:00
This makes sense.
So then we're "living" on land sold to us by early adopters. Will we also sell it to others down the road? Its high spike in value recently indicates that future spikes are also likely.
So is bitcoin more like real-estate, with land costs increasing as the town increases in popularity? Its current valuation of 600 USD per bitcoin provides you a very very small portion of the land relative to what you pay. And I have to wonder whether it may still be a swamp? If it is ...
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:23:56


Is that what happened when income tax was introduced?


Are they the only ones who can do that?


They're not productive *yet* because they aren't taking part. You're identifying them as freeloaders before they've even entered the system. Why is that?
@_date: 2014-02-23 22:29:59


That's the pyramid-scheme kind of strategizing that will bring us to the moon.


And your belief that the only way to increase adoption is through a pyramid scheme belies your claim that Bitcoin is a currency.
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:34:30
So is Bitcoin a product? Or a company? Are bitcoins stocks? Are you a shareholder in Bitcoin? I thought the argument was that Bitcoin is a currency. I didn't know currencies had shareholders. Which is it?
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:32:49
Thank you. As way of thanks to me, will you ask your friend to adopt bitcoin for me? If you do that it will increase the value of your bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:23:11
Again, it's trivial to offer x-currency alongside BTC.
First-mover achievements work great for all the second-movers, too.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:01:37
Do you think the average consumer even knows what that word means?
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:23:43
So it's a non-issue in the grand scheme of the discussion of BTC competitors. Decentralized or not makes no difference to the consumer.
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:37:31


It can be a Bitcoin equivalent with no fees. The model can be exactly the same - just controlled by banks.
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:38:11


And yet they're moving into other cardless forms of digital payment like Isis and SoftBank... What makes you think they aren't interested in a true international alternative to the dollar?


Haha - then how do you buy your BTC? With gold bars?
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:36:52


A model that is easily duplicated.. By kids in basements (the wildly successful Dogecoin).
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:57:16
Why? The BTC community has deluded itself into thinking that it has crafted and developing something exclusive. Unique, special, new, yes. Exclusive? Nope. BTC can be replicated overnight by anyone with a basic understanding of programming and a computer.
The hard part was getting adoption. A bank-run BTC would have hundreds of millions of people adopting on the same day.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:03:35


You should look into some of the profit margins on banking some time, they're eye-opening. The top performing banks are rolling in so many cash they don't know what to do with it. They throw it at consumers just to lock them into their APR and banking fees.
If they wanted to crush BTC tomorrow, trust me, fees are not standing in their way. Executing a BTC-equivalent would cost them micropennies on the dollar - they could probably get someone to do it for them for free. Backing it and securing it is trivial, as BTC has shown. The real threat is in scams not the underlying security.
