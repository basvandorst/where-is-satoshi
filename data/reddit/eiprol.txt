I Really appreciate that, I'll give it a try! 
@_date: 2018-09-23 15:36:51
Sounds interesting, thank you so much!
@_date: 2018-09-23 15:38:35
Yep, that's my concern as well. I rather run some local script than working with external systems/3rd parties; ideally, it would be a personal-made one, but I was hoping to find some open source script to start building my own on top (to fully know how it works before running it). Thank you!
@_date: 2018-09-23 20:32:54
I've been getting these for a few months already. The funny thing is that the latest ones are demanding me to pay around $5000. I mean, c'mon. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 15:35:57
Thanks. Have you tried them? I know I have nothing to lose at this point, but I'd rather try some locally run script first

For those wondering, Firefox Extension update coming soon :)
@_date: 2019-03-18 22:41:55
It's not a wallet, but an extension that *shows* a tippin button in every tweet. How is that dangerous?

@_date: 2018-10-04 18:10:41
Hey! I’ve got a bitcoin node already working, so now it’s time to try with Lightning. Will let you know if something goes wrong, thank you for the offer :)
@_date: 2018-10-06 23:41:07
Why not a qr-code pointing to a url you own (a simple web), that returns the private key once is visited? That way you can change the private key whenever you want (updating web every 24h), and also avoid same user to run a script to check that url too often. No complex blockchain mechanisms involved, no digital billboards.
@_date: 2018-10-10 11:13:08
Totally agree, we need an app for non-techies. Easy, nice, fast, and incredibly simple.  
I'd also add that, if syncing all headers on start is still mandatory, it's gonna be hard to convince people to download an app to do instant payments, if they have to wait first for a couple of hours. Is there anything to improve this on the roadmap? All testnet LN wallets I've tried, require you to do this the first time you open them, and can take a lot of time.
@_date: 2018-10-04 05:33:09
Thanks! Seems like most or them are ‘coming soon’ or using testnet though (at least for iOS). Let me know if you find a good one please!
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:53:18
I might be missing something, but I don’t see the point on using both; just pick one of them (Gauth or Authy), and then add as many services as you want (each service will require to scan a QRCode and will give you a unique code each time); if you add the same “service” to both of them, then of course you will get the same auth code no matter which one you upen (Gauth or Authy)
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:54:13
I’ve been the whole day trying to setup a lightning + bitcoin node on my computer precisely for this; right now, every iOS app I’ve found requieres you to have your own node up and running (or at least that’s what I think)
@_date: 2016-11-20 00:02:58
I'm also interested on this... And I want to add another question (which is my main concern for Hardware Wallets): How does it generate the first HD wallet? Is it really random? I remember creating paper wallets online, and having to increase the entropy by moving the pointer and typing random letters to compensate the lack of randomness (and to avoid getting an already used key)
What's the entropy and the reliability of not getting a duplicated list of words on two different devices (I know that in perfect conditions, being random, it's impossible to find a match; but I'm talking about the entropy it adds, or way of generating them, to be sure that they are being really random). What's the process or the initial signature /entropy they use to generate the keys?
After all, If I'm right, you don't add entropy typing nor moving it, and you have no control on it at the time of creating a seed, right?
@_date: 2016-12-22 10:32:22
I'd say that ledger nano s is a very good product for the money; It's 40% cheaper than trezor/keepkey. I got one, and I'm loving it.

@_date: 2019-02-21 08:33:29
Dev here! The only reason I haven't implemented it yet, is to avoid holding other's people money without their consent. At least at the moment, we'll see in the future :)
@_date: 2019-06-03 08:05:37
Actually you don't need it; every user get a short url with their username that can be shared. For instance, mine is tippin.me/
@_date: 2019-02-14 20:07:48
It's just an early version, but it works (most of the time at least!)! The idea is allowing people to send LN tips to Twitter users just by clicking on a little button you can find in their Tweets. You need to sign up in [Tippin.me]( first, in order to link your Twitter handle to your Tippin one, but once you do it, people can donate you using LN.  
I know Tippin is custodial, but you need a node or a wallet in order to send tips, so... Hopefully, it'll push LN adoption a little bit :)   
Also, it's integrated with [ , so if you have it installed, you don't even have to scan QR codes!
@_date: 2019-02-09 10:23:45
Thank you :)

This is awesome and well deserved... congrats!
I would love to have you on tippin.me, to get Lightning Network tips as well (:

Why using another browser when you already have Tippin.me on Chrome and Firefox?
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:25:01
I usually send SEPA payments EUR-EUR within 24h as well, but this is the first time I tried EUR-GBP. Apparently, once there is change of currency involved, my bank says 5-7 days is their normal. It's unbelievable, I know; I was the first one surprised. But that's the problem, the bank set the rules. And you can do nothing.
(FYI, I'm talking about a Santander's branch: Openbank.)
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:26:32
Yep, I tried, but Transferwise needs a few days to verify your account (if the user is a Company) before you can send money; I got verified yesterday though.
@_date: 2018-04-26 05:30:02
I’ve come to realize that all of us tend to believe that what we know, like and understand, is so important, that should be public knowledge (or at least mentioned in public schools)
I’m usually that guy as well, don’t take me wrong, but... well, just a thought.

@_date: 2019-05-23 23:13:10
This is the whole list of updates :)
�� You can now check your balance from the extension itself
�� Finally, tipping using your balance is now possible (You can still use regular Invoices)
✏️ Now you can leave a note. Always. No matter if you tip using your balance or a regular Lightning Invoice. 
�� Top up. Your account. Using regular, old, good, on-chain Bitcoins. (Bitcoin On-chain cash outs coming soon)
�� Every new user will get a Welcome Gift of 1000 satoshis! (for a limited time)
�� Existing users will get 500 satoshis for each new user they invite. You just have to ask them to type your username when they sign up (using the extension, at the end of the process)
Adoption, there we go!
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:15:47
[tippin.me]( generates a regular Lightning Network invoice for you, so any Lightning Enabled wallet can send Bitcoin to a Tippin-generated Invoice/Code.

After finding Lightning Network both awesome and hard to use, I've been a few days building something to change this. To make it easier for the average Joe. It's not ready yet, and I will post it here when the time comes; But here you have a sneak peak in the comments. For the Reckless one:  
I've created [ , a tipping service entirely built on Lightning Network. You create an account, and then you have a **link to share easily**, where people can send you whatever amount they want over LN. You can of course cashout what you have received whenever you want. It's sort of a **Custodial Lightning Network Wallet :)**
This is for example, my personal link to receive micro-payments:
[ 
If you feel like giving it a try, please send me your feedback :)
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:22:13
Hi guys! a few days ago I announced [tippin.me]( , as a way of getting Lightning Network micropayments without setting up a LN node (It's a simple web custodial wallet, but it's something, at least until we get proper wallets...)  
It's my personal contribution to push LN adoption; and here it's more: **I've just added a simple javascript button that you can integrate in your web (you can find it when you log in).**  
Once someone presses it, a QR code appears so they can send you a LN payment to your [tippin.me]( account. Without leaving your web :)  
That's all for now
(More soon)
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:58:34
Thank you so much for your feedback!
All you've said is really interesting; actually, I have (almost) ready a one-click email signup system too!
I will also add some kind of Social Network integration, and the same goes for a "help" section as well!
Thank you again!  
PS: I just sent you a few cents :P... Did you receive an email on your first-paid-invoice? If not, is it on SPAM?  
@_date: 2018-12-08 12:12:26

Cool! I'm not sure at all, but try writing first the payment request, and then the amount; just like this:
lncli payinvoice lnbc1... 1400
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:13:40
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:03:09
Thanks! I didn't know it, looks awesome!
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:42:48
It needs your credentials In order to generate a customized button for your tippin.me account; otherwise, the button wouldn't point to any user :)
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:33:44
Could be an option, indeed. I'm open to different ways of improving trust here.
Ideally, when I started thinking about this, I wanted to create multiple native wallets on tippin's node (one per user), without knowing the seed myself; but that would not allow me to generate invoices to get paid, and so I wouldn't be able to get QR-Codes. That's why I need to have full control of the wallet, and handle everything under the hood. 
(At least, that's my understanding, I could be wrong; note that this is a side project, and I've been playing with LN for a few weeks only).
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:28:43
More or less, but basically the opposite :P! You can receive tips!
If you want to receive tips or micro payments using Lightning Network, but you don't have a Lightning Network Wallet, you can sign up at tippin.me and get this sort of simple web wallet. That's it.
The addition of this button means that, placing it on your own website, people could send you tips by pressing it (because a QR code would appear, linked to your tippin.me account, and so everything they send would arrive to your web wallet).
However, you don't need the button to get tips. Once you sign up, you already get a link to share. For example, If I want to receive tips, I would share this:
And if you send Lightning Network payment using that QR-Code, it would arrive to my web wallet at tippin.me.
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:14:24
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-12-09 18:04:47
Thank you so much :)!
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:14:09
Yes, exactly
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:45:04
haha I'll have email signup ready (probably) soon :)  
When doing OAuth, I don't request anything special, just give my Twitter App's ID so they handle the login according to the set permissions (as shown in the pic); then I get back a special key to access your email and username (and apparently, read your tweets). But it's just that, no DM, no posting, no nothing.  
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:07:23
If you are running a LND based node, you will be able to test the new upcoming feature: receiving tips on your own node. Feel free to join the beta and send me your feedback once you can use it!
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:40:43
I just opened a channel with ACINQ. If you have incoming capacity with ACINQ, you should be able to receive the cash out once the tx settles :)
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:21:25
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:08:38
Theoretically you could receive any amount, 100$ included (as long as it's inside channel limits)
It's just because it's a beta, and even though I'm reckless, I don't want people to risk too much :P  
Regarding twitter, it's just for convenience, to make it faster. I have a mail signup in the making, but I want it to be passwordless, just one-link-to-your-inbox login type of thing. Might be ready soon.
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:24:59
Thank you :)!
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:47:23
No problem at all :)! I'm already working on a way of signing up using an email; after all, I'm only using twitter as an easy auth method (I don't ask for permissions to read DM nor to post, just email and authentication). Again, thank you so much :)
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:04:47
developer here! Yes, you can. Apparently, It's a known UI bug of many wallets, and should be fixed soon; the idea is that you could send the amount you want, not a predefined one :)
@_date: 2018-12-03 09:26:01
Thank you so much for adding my there :)
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:49:25
Probably the main ones at some point, but I have to think about it. In my opinion, once you start throwing many social networks into the mix, things become messy. Now you know how to find a user on Tippin, (tippin.me/ but if that user has many social profiles linked, what happens? People not always have the same user handle everywhere, and even though there are ways minimize this problem, It could be confusing for people... I can see the benefits, but I can certainly see the disadvantages.
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:05:58
much appreciated! :)
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:16:59
Those are predefined permissions. As far as I know, you can not opt-out of that when creating a Twitter Auth App (I'd gladly change it if possible). Sort of the minimum allowed in twitter Auth:
PS: I have no intention of reading your tweets, to be honest :)
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:25:54
Or you could create a tippin.me account and receive/send tips with a link ��
Disclaimer: I made it
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:03:43
There was a small bug; should be fixed now! Check it and let me know, please 
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:35:40
A couple of days ago, I released [tippin.me]( (beta) here, a service to get Lightning Network tippings without running a node; not as good as controlling your keys, but I think it's nice as a workaround until we get nice wallets :)  
(Original [link here](
Well, the next step in my roadmap is almost ready; I've created a javascript button that can be **integrated in any web**, allowing you to receive Lightning Network tips \*\*anywhere\*\*: Once they press the button, a **popup** appears with a QR-Code. No need to go to [tippin.me]( :)  
I'll announce it when it's ready (give me a couple of days more, maybe less).
  
I hope you like it!

@_date: 2018-12-03 08:57:02
Cool! I just opened a channel from tippin's node to yours, because it couldn't find a path to send your coins, so in a few minutes, when the transaction gets confirmed, you should be able to properly cash out from your dashboard :)
**Edit: It failed to open a channel with you. Let me know whenever your node is online, to try again **
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:40:24

I've got a mail-singup option almost ready, but I want it to be passwordless (1-magiclink to your inbox). Twitter is just for sake of convenience, nothing else.
@_date: 2018-12-03 09:58:12
Thanks for the hints, I didn't know about it, and really appreciate it; I should implement something similar!

That's so nice :) thank you �� 
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:53:29
Honestly, I'm not sure how I could improve this; I associated this project somehow to my reddit account and my twitter account, even in the **about** section of the web, so maybe that's something.
This is my first project in the crypto space, but not in general; I'm a game developer with no intention of running with other people's satoshis :P. (By the way, I'm releasing [this game]( soon haha)
Just in case it's not clear yet, the idea is making this profitable somehow, i.e. pro plans, merchants, extra features... Your coins are safe :)
PS: Thank you for your last line!
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:36:39
Hey I'm getting notifications about a failing cash out. If the error message says something like "can't reach node" or "can't find path", let me know so I can try opening a channel with that node :D
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:10:31
Thank you! I'd love to. I've been thinking about it actually; It all depends on how this works out (it's just a sideproject right now)
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:10:51

@_date: 2018-12-07 22:43:11
Thanks :):)
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:18:44
Take into account that this is a service to get micro-payments from time to time, and cash out to your real LN wallet. Tips, donations. Something you publicly ask for. My opinion is that you can trade a little anonymity for convenience here. But I understand it's just my way of seeing it :)
Technically speaking, I don't think people can see where the money goes once it's sent. The way LN works, it is not like the blockchain. I mean, if you are the one sending coins to that QR, you know It goes to tippin's node, but the account is unknown, and handled on the backend of the service. So you have no way of knowing the balance of that user. Yes, you have to trust a 3rd party, me, instead of running your own private LN wallet, but...
The thing here is that I can't think of any other way of pushing adoption without custodial web wallets like this at first. I want to keep it simple and easy. There is no way my mother, brother or friend, decide to start running his own LN node just to pay a few cents for a sticker, or to get donations on his web; at least not at this stage of development. However, if they can start using a service like this, where you can signup with just a twitter account, maybe at some point they will realize how good it is to run their own node... :)
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:14:01
You are right
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:41:55
I'll have email signups soon; but just for the record, I don't get permissions to use your Twitter account, so it's just an auth method.
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:50:14
That's super nice, thank you :) (Even though the real devs are the ones developing Bitcoin and LN, not me; I'm just trying to think of ways of pushing adoption by making things a bit easier)
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:54:25
Oh, didn't know, I just discovered! That could be interesting, for sure! (I had also considered the bot part before, to integrate it with reddit/twitter/telegram) 
@_date: 2018-12-06 17:43:36
Well, that's being my approach as well... It's way better than complaining!
And now is when I spam my little Lightning Network project: [ :)
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:39:16
Thanks for the advice; no doubt, if this takes off, I will contact with somebody in the field in order to avoid troubles (legally, tax related, etc). However, I don't think it's necessary at this point, being a beta project using a beta network of digital money, and holding just a couple of bucks. (I'd love to get to the point where seeking legal and financial advice becomes essential though)
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:45:30
I know you may be talking about some cryptographic mechanism (Signed message, PGP key, etc), but I would really want to keep it simple enough for the average joe.
Right now, creating a [tippin.me]( account requires you to sing up using an existing twitter account, so you would need a twitter fake account for this purpose. If you are important enough to be impersonated, maybe some kind of **\*\*unverified/verified\*\*** mark along your tippin name could do the trick. I you want to get verified, you should provide some kind of proof (and maybe here, we can talk about PGP).  
I know it's not perfect, and requires manual intervention on my side, but I can't think of anything else (again, keeping it simple enough so normies don't get scared of the process, which I think is crucial for adoption).
  
Any idea or suggestion to solve this potential problem?
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:22:37
Still can't reach tippin's node? Damn, I thought we had a channel open already... I'll look into it
@_date: 2018-12-09 12:19:15
Haha yep, I have to speed up that animation :P  
As for the cash out amount, I was forcing the balance to be at least 1sat bigger than the cash out amount, for possible fees! But I've just removed that 
@_date: 2018-12-08 11:03:53
