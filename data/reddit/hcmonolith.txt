There are ways to have your funds secured even if a robber risked their life by breaking into your house to steal your private keys. For example, use a cold storage device that is pin protected. If they steal your seed, make sure it's password protected and not easily brute forced, giving you time to move the funds. Another example - use a multi signature wallet with a trusted other party. That way, the robber would have to steal both sets of keys to move any funds.

Not true at all. Day traders are looking at day-to-day performance. Hodlers (or more long term investors) could careless if day traders take the price up or down 10% from one day to the other. To them, watching people day trade such an undervalued and volatile asset seems like an unnecessary gamble and a fool's game.

Every human involved in the security of these keys is a potential vulnerability. Obviously we don't know all the precautions CB takes, but it seems to me that it would only take one self-destructive employee to leak these keys. Sure, they'll probably be caught, but in a billion to trillion dollar industry, the competition will encourage this type of infiltration. You don't need computers to hack people. It's naive to think everyone will hold their own private keys, but those that can should. There's little sense in keeping your keys with a company that has a billion dollar target on their back.

Based on this, the halving events seem to coincide with the near-bottom of each cycle; but with the increasing days/cycle, how will cycle 5 be impacted by only being roughly 1 year from the next halving event? What will happen as these "cycles" include more than one halving? A reversal in the increasing cycle time? Or does the halving just coincidentally coincide with the bottoms for now?

You could fit a similar line to the 7+ years of price history data here too and see a similar trend. Key point is adoption and the networking effect creating the exponential trend. Forget whether or not the Halvings impact the price or not (although there's evidence to support this - see McCook's paper

It could be decades. The current use of the protocol is infinitesimally small compared to what it could be. Even the internet has only reached about 50% of the global population. Just hodl and do your best to ignore the day-to-day price fluctuations and shitcoin claims. Learn how the protocol works in the meantime, and reinforce your position in it.

I'm no expert, but speaking from personal experience - even going from minimal knowledge to basic level knowledge on how the Bitcoin network/protocol operates changes how you view the way adoption &amp; application will play out in the future. I encourage everyone I talk with on the subject to take the time to become at least somewhat familiar with how it works, then the future trend becomes pretty obvious. Reading "Mastering Bitcoin" by Andreas Antonopolous was a big help.

Is the recipient public address to the coinbase, or generation, transaction shown in the block?
@_date: 2018-10-12 22:33:55
Bcash hard forked from the main chain to increase block capacity, thereby reducing the average time required for a transaction to be confirmed (given the same fee). The problem for bcash is that this is only advantageous when the main chain is clogged up with many pending transactions. Question to ask is, what makes bitcoin strong? The answer is immutability and security through its rigorous proof of work algorithm. So how can you tell which chain is the more secure chain? Look at the total network hash rate &amp; corresponding difficulty rating and it's obvious. Bitcoin's network is much stronger than bcash's. A coin's value depends on this security. Bitcoin will become much more transactional with 2nd layer solutions, such as the Lightning Network.

No, they have to push the 30k because it's the only input in their wallet available for the transaction. It's like reaching into your wallet and only having a 30k BTC bill to pay for your dinner. You have to get change back. So there's two outputs - one to the intended recipient for the amount specified (0.83BTC), and one back into the original address as change. Think of it like an automated cashier.
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:52:39
Although it seems the large BTC transaction was in fact mostly change for the smaller (0.83BTC) transaction, the point you make is separate -- So we take the time between send, receive, then back to USD, compare that to the average volatility in that given timespan and apply a tolerance to the value transferred. They sent $194M +/- $1M, for example. Point is, this transfer of value was relatively cheap to do. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:38:09
I don't think it's about security, or anonymity. When the funds were transferred to the storage address, they were all sent at once, or later batched, thereby becoming a single unspent transaction output (UTXO). The owner then used that single UTXO to transfer 0.83BTC to another address, requiring that single UTXO to be split into two. One is the 0.83 transfer, and the other is change. It works similarly to physical cash (e.g. breaking a large bill).
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:04:13
Fees are based on the size of the transaction, in bits, since the size of a block is limited (1MB). It's more expensive to send 0.83BTC as multiple UTXOs than just one.

Easy, we know how many blocks there are; therefore, we know the number of coins minted based on the miner reward schedule: 50BTC/block for 1st 210,000, 25BTC/block for next 210,000, 12.5/block for the next 210,000, etc. What isn't known for sure is how many have been lost.

I see your point, but if on-chain privacy is implemented, do you not see this as a big potential problem for the adoption of Bitcoin (e.g. regulated exchange bans)? 
My understanding is the LN would use onion routed transactions to mask identity, but even this is only anonymous until there's a large enough effort from law enforcement to investigate it.
The individual user is masked from transaction data mining by corporations, but they're still not 100% anonymous given the worst case situation.

Bitcoin is not inherently deflationary. Currently, 12.5 bitcoins are minted with each solved block (roughly every 10 minutes). That's inflationary. Controlled, predictable, and neutral inflation. The rate of inflation is halved every 210,000 blocks, trending towards zero around 2140. Bitcoin is not deflationary until then. But again, even when it becomes deflationary, why is that a bad thing? Your savings grow in purchasing power over time.

How would you prove government or corporation A gave funds to government or corporation B if the transaction was anonymous?

If people start paying me to buy their BTC off of them for fiat currency that is virtually infinitely inflatable, I'll know something is wrong. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:04:40
I don't think you want privacy on the base layer (Bitcoin blockchain). With a limited block space and greater adoption, it will become very expensive to transact on the base layer. Only the most important (and large) transactions will take place on the blockchain as final settlement, by the big boys (i.e. governments, corporations, banks, etc.). Smaller transactions will take place on layer-2 technologies (e.g. Lightning Network) virtually for free. The small transactions can then be batched by these larger organizations that run mega-Lightning nodes (or the like), to settle on the blockchain. You don't want these future large organizations to have anonymous transactions on the base layer. You want them to be held accountable, need be. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 23:19:17
I understand A can prove it to B. I'm worried about how they can be held accountable for it by the general public.

What would better than bitcoin look like to you?
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:18:04
Your proposed situation - the currently unused 2/3 miner capability is used to 51+% attack the network, the network's security is brought into question, the value of bitcoin plummets - why are these miners mining bitcoin...? They'd be shooting themselves in the foot by attacking the network. 
A more likely situation - given the current reduced hash rate power of the network, a separate entity is able to amass enough processing power to attack the network and publish a fraudulent block. The miners notice the fraudulent fork and switch back on their miners to negate the fraudulent entity's block by publishing the future blocks (the network follows the blockchain with the most proof of work behind it). Miners with idle hardware still serve as protectors of the main chain (it's in their best interest to protect it if necessary).
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:02:28
Bitcoin supply will continue to increase until roughly 2140. To say it is a deflationary currency today is false. After 2140, the inflation rate will be 0% (miners are no longer rewarded newly minted bitcoin). Meanwhile, demand will likely continue to increase (global population trends upward), meaning the purchasing power per unit currency will increase. Explain the negative implications of this please. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 23:56:01
To me it would seem better to keep the base layer transparent for the big money, and the 2nd layer private for the individual.
