To clarify I had never intended to post this particular raffle on reddit. Recommendation from fellow bitcoin holder. Said many people in this thread have some bitcoin but are just getting in and would love to participate.  So yes to clarify I am new to reddit but nothing is forcing you to participate.

No sir I have clarified with numerous individuals as this is also not my first raffle. It can be clarified as a raffle since there is a small ticket purchase fee and the number of entries are limited. This is a raffle and you as well do not have to participate.

Maybe you have just been scammed before which I can understand. To answer your question, maybe you do not understand how a raffle works, if only 10 people buy tickets that is .10 Bitcoin. The winner of the raffle  will still receive 5 Bitcoin which means I'll be paying 4.9 Bitcoin. This is not my first Raffle, I simply offer tickets for those individuals who wish to purchase them rarely in my raffles do I ever get close to the raffle giveaway amount in tickets purchased so trust me I put in plenty of my own coins. Again anyone who wishes not to participate I FIRMLY respect your choice.

Listen, I am open to this. If you can justify or show where you have actively lobbied for the raffle I will happily send you .10 bitcoin.

The raffle has been posted for two hours. Don't worry, I do daily updates for any raffle I do. Check back tomorrow for current number of tickets purchased.

You as well my friend. I would kindly ask you to set yourself a little reminder to check back on this post to see the winner and confirm receipt of their coins, this way for any future raffles I do, you can either participate or at least not bad mouth my integrity and intentions based on pure assumption

That is a fair comment. I probably should have kept my Raffle more social media base like the last one. An investor I work with regularly said he participated in a bitcoin community on Reddit where people are constantly posting how amazing it feels to own a single bitcoin, to tell you the truth I haven't heard of Reddit before then but I figured a community full of people who speak my language who would be eternally grateful to win 5 bitcoin I figured what a perfect setting for one of my raffles. I did a litecoin Raffle shortly after I made an insane profit on the boost it had. Same thing here with Bitcoin, the new ATH has made me feel comfortable enough to give away 5 bitcoins even if only one person enteted. Anyways I appreciate the honesty and comments all the same.

I am not trying to make money, I'm trying to spread the interest for crypto and spread real Karma in to the world by giving one lucky person the opportunity to be a part of something amazing. I have made more money off alt coins than I could spend in a lifetime. This is what's wrong the world today, the good hearted people are scammers and the scammers are far better and more believeable so they get jobs like president. It's okay my friend if you do not wish to participate I completely understand. I simply pose this question why in the world would a scammer or someone trying to make money limit the number of entries one person can have?
