How is the situation for Swiss in Switzerland, what if you liquidate a portfolio of Crypto that you partook in via ICO via BitcoinSuisse and have the proceeds transferred to your accounts at any commercial bank such as UBS, ZKB or CS? What is there to expect, are they going to freeze your account unless you can document the origin of funds? Would you suggest a PB setup as well in that case? Sorry - just curious. :)

Of course it's hard to believe, I am pretty skeptical as well, anything seems to go at this moment: that Mark just went rogue, daytraded lost all his assets and then covered through client assets and lost them as well, but seriously the situation is rather dubious in the way that information is not forthcoming and MtGox going into Bankruptcy Protection instead of straight into Bankruptcy - also what happened with the investigation through Japanese officials, no further word has been heard since the day that they announced to be ready to take action? There's too much uncertainity, rather strange in the face of people having lost $400MM, which fuels speculation.

Don't kid yourself - market is still in denial (just check bitcoinbuilder to see the level of hope holding prices for goxcoin), once the official confirmation goes out that 750k BTC are "lost" and there is no plan, the price will tank, so set these limit orders at below USD 100 at BTC-E and don't have that delusion that MtGox is already priced into the current rates, prices are still locked due to the unclarity at Gox. I think we are still far away from having any clear damage assessement, the reputational damage... will be ammunition for any regulatory clamp downs on the exchanges.
If there is a miracle in the works that yields everyone his balance back, well, it will propel the price back over 1k. I can't see this working out, someone would have to loan either coins or hundreds millions of fiat to MtGox - this might be only possible if some of those BTC holders are convinced that Gox officially going bankrupt would kill BTC and make their holdings worthless, with some kind of agreement that pretty much guarantees them to recoup their funds... don't really see this happening.
Well there's some exceptions:
- MtGox and all other BTC exchanges could issue shares w. a dividend payment of BTC 750k set to a long enough timeframe, financed through trading fees, or a new coin valued at a market cap of BTC 750K and distribute/allocate accordingly with everyone's lost BTC holding. You could peg the coin to a set exchange rate to BTC or make it fungible into BTC after a certain timeframe, don't know it that would work or could work but it could allow the market to regenerate and provide the BTC holders with an outlook to reclaim their losses.
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:51:08
What about users that converted altcoins to bitcoin in order to fund their account at MtGox? You cannot change their chains as well.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:45:03
- Create 750k Gox-coin issued to all debt holders fungible into 1 BTC only at Gox.com with a small yearly interest, create exchange rates for all altcoins, each funged gox coin is destroyed, set a monthly contingent that users can convert into BTC in line with possible gox btc profit. 
- Hire new crew and start new trading activity - pioneer full transparency, hire prof. team of coders to thoroughly check Midas and the accounting mess, build a transparent btc safety/reserve pool which balance is visibile on the webpage all time and have it move between wallets on a monthly basis to verify holding. 
- give all gox victims lifetime 0 trading fees on all their trades and/or issue 3% of non-voting shares for the new platform paid as dividend on trading revenues and distribute accordingly among debtholders depending on their debt as apology, share allocation can be linked to gox-coin and destroyed if funged. Alternatively gox-coins could be kept and freely traded.
- Buy BTC over the counter to slowly replace goxcoins

Crypto-Trade is already offline for more than a couple of days
C-Cex got also "hacked" and lost approx 400 BTC through an exploit, someone used the BTC to buy around 120k Darkcoin and sold on Poloniex and crushed the price. However the exploiter came forward on bitcointalkforum when one of the C-Cex users wrote that he lost everything and couldn't pay his rent and tried to give back all the proceeds from his coup  - no idea what the damage was and what the latest is.
For this kind of information it's best to consult bitcointalkforum, there's much better information available then on reddit imho.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:47:47
224 BTC, well that's life and my own fault, you make a bet you lose, at least I die a good man knowing I bailed some Gox users out (not due to really altruistic motives though). :)
@_date: 2014-04-22 10:20:28
I know this will not really help your issue, but you shouldn't sign up with exchanges that are run by one person, regardless how well the implementation has been programmed. What if Realsolid gets hit by a bus? It's a huge risk to keep assets on a platform that has a single point of failure. Also Realsolid/Coinhunter has had some historical issues with the community, that should raise red flags. You can research into this on Bitcointalk (Solidcoin, McxFees and his sabbatical break). This is not someone you want to hold custody of your assets.

No official statement regarding the existence of 750k BTC and if these have been robbed or lost, all is speculation at this point. We all wait for clarification.
At this moment bitcoinbuilder is a bet on gox surviving or crashing, people are gambling - just like they do on just-dice or when buying a lottery ticket, as time goes by, odds of survival are dropping.

@_date: 2014-02-27 23:19:04
The danger is prop trading, even with regulated investment banks in the finance industry the prop desks can be a huge liability on the broker side, with potential to realize big PnL gains but also big losses, being able to erase days of commission revenues on the day-to-day business - and you are talking about an industry that had specialized itself on this.
From an ops perspective client funds need to be clearly segregated and walled, you need a ledger and an internal and external auditing process that happens on a quarterly basis, that checks your statements and procedures, also for all systems four eyes validation principles should be implemented, no one should be able to execute an action alone that opens you for a risk of manipulation, abuse or error, for certain functions we maintain six eyes validation procedures on our systems. It might sound overkill, but you mitigate risks a lot that way, especially if your work is routine.
There should be a risk control team that monitors trading activity in realtime on trading washbooks (which allow to set restrictions) which are then daily reconciled at EoD and accounted for every single day, if not done so - you open up your environment for abuse.
Most of the exchanges seem to run weak on the operations side. There's a lot of former IT, IB or sales people sourcing from the finance industry having started these exchanges, that seem to streamline everything into STP procedures on slick platforms, but I haven't encountered many senior operations people being involved, as the way certain business procedures are employed looks horrendous from the outside.
So any people running exchanges: get your backoffice in order and hire some operation specialists - also employing a real auditing company is not bad: they can actually identify weaknesses and assist improving your procedures, a lot is common sense anyways.

It's not just bitcoin but cryptocurrencies in general, we have agreed on that the blockchain, as a decentralised public ledger, is one of the major developments that people tend to overlook, BTC in itself is just the first coin that still can adapt depending on requirements, there are already more than 100 altcoins around, feat. different properties that can simulate experimental environments and contribute to general development of all coins - see Kimoto Gravity Well etc. Yes, you have deflationary currencies but you have inflationary currencies as well, the nice thing is that we can now test how they work and behave and even better you have a choice with what you want to go with, heck you can even stay in fiat if you like. Coexistence.

depends on the business plan, if conditions are no longer toxic and u can offer a good roi w. a sound business plan and trusted mgmt and backing in the community, there's always someone up for opportunity - anyways seems the gox lawyer is making an announcement just now.
@_date: 2014-03-01 09:16:18
There could be more than just Silkroad, they could have frozen and "seized" the assets at the exchange and be trying to link part of them to terrorist organisations or organised crime, seeing that the US Gov has instruments that maybe allows to make connections outside of the blockchain. If this would be happening they want the part they are investigating on, to remain static and not to be in flux. This could take ages and would suggest that other exchanges could experience the same troubles later on.

Just wondering Bruce, if it indeed comes down to a gag order and seizure of assets through the US Gov or any other Gov that would have crippled MtGox- what should other exchanges do with their cold storage setup to mitigate this risk, as this kind of experience could potentially happen to any exchange all over again? Also do you think that this might be a downside of not yet having a regulated status in the US?
@_date: 2014-03-14 11:16:18

Well if you like the risk proposition the pay-off could be huge, either way if MtGox goes insolvent, the destroyed trust will tank the market turning BTC into shit for a while, I imagine there's a ton of BTC holders impacted, levels might fall deep enough, so that you could buy back w. fiat. MtGox insolvency might also have no effect, but the likelihood of that happening, I value as high as MtGox going insolvent. This is an opportunity to either win big or to lose all.

@_date: 2014-03-01 10:40:57
I think it's important to remain skeptical but to grow accustomed to the idea that you never will see your coins back. I have lost 224 BTC in this ordeal, not because I kept them on MtGox but because I was a greedy fuck w. too much risk appetite and thought buying into Gox would fetch a good return, only me to blame here. Honestly if there was an easy way to reimburse everyone, that would have been done already. Seeing that they had to go into bankruptcy protection indicates serious issues with them having had no other choice. Whatever exactly happened with those 850k bitcoins, I am sure that information will be made available at some time. 
Currently, there's just not enough information and speculation is running wide (guilty as well) - most of the time when these issues happen they tend to end up with pretty simple explanations, let's hope for the best and let it stand as a lesson to everyone: cover the cost of your initial investment as quickly as possible and never invest money that you cannot afford to lose, even if you think the odds seem to be overwhelmingly positive. 
I am happy enough to say that I didn't put my existence on the line, for those that are not so lucky I seriously hope you guys will fall back on your feet.

- Convert into your preferred currency and purchase on your preferred online retail broker platform
- Find someone holding Tesla shares and willing to part for bitcoin. You can then agree an OTC deal with a lawyer to exchange bitcoin vs. shares for a good exchange rate. You require a securities safekeeping account, so that your CP can transfer the shares into your holding. Depending on how much % of total company shares you hold there's a reporting obligation at your custodian bank to the issuer, taking tesla's market cap into consideration, as long as you haven't heisted Mt.Gox you don't have to worry about that.
- There's also the option to request a physical delivery - but boy it's a chore and expensive.

@_date: 2014-03-01 09:08:09
Doesn't matter - all we require are the wallet addresses that MtGox used to store the 850k, if the money vanished that is fine, we should still be able to validate if there was enough balance at some point on them, to confirm that liquidity in cold storage was once available and then see how the funds dispersed away over time.
Any statement of having lost 850k BTC should be followed with proper documentation as to how, where and when funds were lost. I didn't see any information on that, so I am assuming that it's still being analyzed and subject of the ongoing investigation.
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:12:26
Why is the pre-mined part even included on coinmarketcap? Standards for these lists have to really improve, what's next a one coin altcoin that is 100% premined and set to USD 1'000'000'000'000.

Also is it really necessary, or would a deal essentially mean that everyone would benefit from it? (Not saying that a 16.5% EQ stake is going to make 180k users whole that quickly, especially if the exchange needs to overcome a certain revenue or profit threshold, before it can issue a yield back)

honestly there is no regulation that bans exchanges from prop trading - I wouldn't be surprised if other exchanges do the same
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:45:49
Cryptsy is a huge red flag imho, the countless stories of people complaining about huge delays (hours to weeks) in coins being credited to their account, the amount of coins that is added in relative short notice, disappearing funds etc, the non-existing support answers.
I think it's really time that we get a non-profit organization that audits and certifies exchanges based on their business, operation and support model, I still don't understand why we don't have someone establishing quality standards.
@_date: 2014-03-01 10:54:04
1) would indicate the worst possible outcome, even if funds would be restored. Because if the US Gov can gag exchanges and freeze coins, then it would mean that every single exchange out there is exposed to this risk, it would also showcase the massive pitfall of not being regulated - governments can do with your assets what they want.
Bottom line, we need decentralised exchanges - fast.

if there's anything to criticise its people like him trying to calm or not having come forward with their knowledge right away, I am disgusted w. the joint communication approach that might seem to suggest prior knowledge and mtgox not halting trading right away. also all these whales cashing out in time suggests information leaking through circles that had more information than others.
@_date: 2014-03-01 11:44:40
Assuming that scenario to be true: Japan is US friendly and [they have a extradition treaty with the US]( I assume that resisting a US gag order or National Security Letter might be a felony within the US, regardless what nationality you have they might court you, so Mark's legal counsel might have suggested to comply instead of to resist, as the risks of resisting a gag order might be too high in view of the US' worldwide sphere of influence. Also Mt.Gox looking for money transmission license and a US cash correspondent (which all are US based) might have tied Mark's hands. I think there wasn't much choice considering this hypothetical scenario to be true, from a business but also personal perspective, the US had him by the balls
@_date: 2014-03-01 10:04:59

@_date: 2014-02-28 09:03:21
this is not about people that haven't lost money -  the current debtholders would agree to convert their debt into equity - those that don't want to join would have to be presented w. a reimbursement plan that they can agree on. focus then would be organise liquidity and re-organise the structure, maybe re branding and voting a board and new leadership.
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:16:06

Who is exactly supposed to act as buy support for a stable $2k bitcoin price? Even back when BTC was $1.2k - buy support was very thin at those levels. 
Everyone is going to look how MtGox plays out - how did these 850k coins disappear... as long as this question is not answered, I doubt you are getting any big new investors, too much risk on the table.
Also you just had an incident that might have left a deep financial impact with some of the 127k potential bitcoin traders that were buying and selling coins and contributing to price momentum of BTC, not all of them are knocked out surely, but some might be - temporarily - more careful now as to how much coin they deposit on exchanges to ride on the swings.

There is no one that knows where the value of Bitcoin is going to be a couple years down the road, it could very well dive back below USD 100 and remain there for the rest of its life. The same excitement that has you believe in a future for BTC can be met with a strong believe that BTC isn't ever going to have its breakthrough moment, it wouldn't be the first piece of superiour technology that is way ahead of its time and dies exactly because of that.
If people remember the famous business lunch session with Andreas Antonopoulos just before the price rally happened which had him in a fascinating talk about how Bitcoin and its revolutionary ledger system with the deflationary component is bound to go up in value arguing that it might rise up to 10k per BTC simply due to the scarcity and the multiple ways for application that can substitute all these official records that are outdated and make everyone a future millionaire, expecting cryptocoin trillionaires to appear out of this idea, well the market was certainly picking that sentiment up expecting BTC to go up into the 10k area, until it hit USD 1124.7 per BTC and since then never got back up there.
@_date: 2017-02-11 12:10:49
It's one of the underlying issues why I see Bitcoin as failed: 
The whole underlying idea felt to me to move beyond the restrictions and controls that govern currencies (and other forms of assets) as issued by the CBs and other federal institutions of individual nations and to bestow that power globally onto people, under the premise of liberating them, which would have been an interesting exercise to witness, as to how societies would have adopted and wrapped around the integration of Bitcoin and to see the associated shift that could have manifested into more diverse power structures, closer to the people, giving them better means to safeguard their societies.
Instead, there's petty fights as to who is supposed to be controlling the protocol, scams of people preying onto people and the majority of people that are supposed to use it, only seem to care about it as a way to get rich, hoarding and trading it - hoping towards disparities that shift wealth levels into their own favour. A reckless behaviour and egocentrical mindset not unlike what the greedy "1%" and "banksters" of the finance industry are being accused of. It seems the experiment proves that only few people really act selfless if given the opportunity, most will run with their selfish desires. (no suprise there)
This all on the backdrop of the financial industry adopting the underlying technology into their infrastructure, that benefits their purpose greatly, enabling said industry to operate on a much smaller footprint, with way better margins and unparalleled means of control - supporting the next great goal that financial industry and governments have dreamed about for a long time: a cashless society that is completely transparent and that makes its users totally dependent on having access to their respective payment networks as provided by the financial industry and controlled by the government. A nice instrument of future compliance, that can be easily targeted at people, institutions and nations - that don't behave.
To some degree, it would have been better if Satoshi would have never created Bitcoin: it's a failed experiment born out of a dream, that swung into a nightmare.

Bcause it's not the monetary value of Bitcoin that measures the degree of success, rather the idea was to effect change in society and not much has happened on that front - people are wrapping themselves into idealistic pretence only to enrich themselves - thus the only thing currently in process of transformation is the financial industry and as such the change to society won't come as a move of liberation from bottom up as intended, but instead will be felt as a push that is going to come down onto our all necks, once cashless societies are wider realities. In cashless societies you can easily enforce a ban on disruptive tech such as open cryptocurrencies, that still need to interface with traditional monetary systems in order to move value in both directions, the difference is that bitcoin hasn't got adoption rates and trust factors on its side, and while there has been a certain inflow into Bitcoin, it's peak market cap of USD 20B is just a drop in the ocean.
Also Bitcoin can be controlled through it's inherent design flaw: It's vulnerable to the 51% attack and 70% of all hashrate nowadays are coming from just four China based institutions, with more consolidation likely to follow. It's just a matter of time until it's getting abused.
Also, any system based on direct democracy allows you to participate and influence on the change of direction, the process to appoint voted representatives is also democratic and more transparent than the current number of core devs that are defining the fate of the Bitcoin protocol.

People being in cryptocurrency for the big USD gains should rethink their motivation, what happened to the ideals of the past, seems many people have been corrupted by the pontential profits and lost focus on why cryptocurrency seemingly was considered so important and full of potential to change a society. If you are not in for the Fiat you also don't have a problem with altcoins per se, as you realise, they aren't competition they are just filling niches and conducting experiments in isolated environments. Obviously that is only true for those that aren't a pure money grab.

Rather bitgroining at trends being used to extrapolate future value if the metrics are based on a single asset class that came into creation in 2009...  Extrapolating future value from a trend taken from any stock market index makes sense as it is based on a basket of assets contributing to the overal value, so having assets such as enron, bears and stearns defaulting on you - doesn't fuck your trend for good too.
Look at that glorious trend pointing to the moon before it hit the ground of reality.

By that logic no one would ever have to sell or buy... because all a trend ever does is indicate infinite gains or infinite loss. 
Remember the Nikkei in the 80s all that boom everyone hoped would make one rich and where is it today? Still only gloom. 
Ugly is just the people being burned over and over again in speculative asset bubbles. People caught in the same rich dreams just like back towards the end of 2013, when the fuel for everyone's get rich quick fever was named "China" too and everyone was waiting for MtGox to give raise to the chicken - another set of dreamers the LTC bunch. 
Instead it brought truth to the believers. What is a 20B market cap driven by believe? It's nothing without adoption - it's a tiny blob in the big stream of financial transactions that moves each single day across all payment networks...  
Bitcoin as a coin is a done affair, the tech of the blockchains will live on and will get adopted by the financial industry and will pick up all that demand BTC is still hoping to harness, just wait for when the PBOC backed state banks will release their own official coins and the PRC will enact a legal framework.
This dream will crash again.

There's many reasons: it's too inconvenient and people are just too lazy to care for these things. Or as someone wrote above, they don't want to pay the price to derisk themselves when inactive or FOMO, people thinking they are going to miss out on volatility and thus feel they need to be ready at all times, just in case and then you have all those operating with bots, to accumulate or to sell mining yields, even though I hope most of those repatriated on a regular basis. there's also the show offs, that liked to manipulate the markets through placing massive buy and sell walls, especially dangerous when you got a troll box, where you can gloat on people's reactions.
There's a lot of people that got to money quick without having the proper understanding of the respective value that they hold that comes from trying to build wealth from years of hard work. When I read about that guy with 25, that had nearly 2MM in his portfolio, not cashing out, because he was lacking 40k, it just boggles my mind.

@_date: 2017-07-26 15:03:02
There's a couple of potential outcomes, depending on if Alexander Vinnik is the Alexander that founded BTC-E.
- The exchange is in maintenance as Aleksey is burning all access paths that Alexander knows about, securing the platform from infiltration if Alexander was to spill any knowledge that the authorities could use to infiltrate the platform, which means everything has to be moved, maybe even their positions on wallets.
Seeing that Alexander has been detained, means the risk to operate this platform has increased significantly, as they must assume all knowledge about their current setup and all people operating it, being shared with the authorities, opening up severe questions about the future. 
- Depending on the answers the platform can either re-emerge with the intention to keep its business afloat, despite the detention of Alexander.
- Or the platform re-emerges, for one last time, in a withdrawal-only state so that people can remove their holdings and is burnt afterwards, with Aleksey and all other people connected to BTC-E choosing to disappear.
- Unlikely scenario would be that the platform has already been infiltrated. I don't think that twitter message would have appeared and it seems that Alexander hasn't yet been extradicted to the US authorities, so the likelihood for that must be small. I also assume that authorities not stating the website might be a hint that they haven't got any control over it.
Whatever the result, I assume Alexander will be exemplified the same way as Ross Ulbricht w. Silk Road, showing that the US knows no mercy with unregulated exchanges that do not co-operate with regulatory authorities and thus allow themselves to be instrumentalised for money laundering and tax evasion.

Assets that belonged to members of this crypto community you are a part of as well? The result of MtGox's downfall and the damage to cryptocurrency scammed the crypto industry out of progress for three years... yes, BTC-e seemingly was the biggest scammer of all.
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:28:28
This should only really be an issue with small amounts, that you can afford to lose. If we are talking about trades with face values up into the ten thousands, the costs that come with restricting your overnight/counterparty risk should be covered through your trading activity. if you deal with unregulated exchanges, you are facing a huge counterparty risk, as they can be taken down at any time, you need to price that risk accordingly. better to have a harder time generating proftits, than to lose your principal to authorities.

That has been discussed ad nauseum at mtgoxinsolvency with Mark Karpeles even chipping in. Any funds returned would go to the shareholders. The Coinlabs lawsuit while draging on the process, will most likely be thrown out as it doesn't have legs to walk on, it's the main reason why the pay-out process got delayed. Mark has pledged that any funds that go to shareholders would be used to make creditors whole. The issue is however, if funds are received by shareholders they are open to ligitation, which can drag the process to make creditors whole. 
The question above everything else however, is how many funds relating to MtGox are left, in what form, who is in control (looking at you 60k+30k BTC on the move), and what's going to happen with them, once authorities get hold of them. Complicated questions that most probably see years down the road to be answered.

If Alex was indeed one of the founders of BTC-E, this whole maintenance action could be the other founder securing the platform and burning all access paths Alex is aware of, so that Alex knowledge cannot be used to infiltrate the platform. Based on this the platform can either resurface for usage, secured from Alex detention and potential spil of information or the other founder(s) might decide to pack and run. 
If they run, those with funds online, can only hope that BTC-E re-emerges once more so that people can remove their holdings, let's hope that the platform does emerge and doesn't stay in hiatus forever.
From the twitter messages etc, I suspect they might re-emerge at least, let's see what comes from that.

One of the BTC-e operators Alexander Vinnik got arrested in Greece  and is currently waiting extradiction into the US. US Federal agencies have seized BTC-e's operation, it's currently unclear to what extent, see their PR over here:  There was some hick-up of communication from other BTC-e operators who wanted to bring the site back up  but the domain got formally seized yesterday. From the looks, the US regards BTC-e as unregulated exchange that was used for money laundering platform for criminal activities. One major twist was that Wizsec released a report,  that there is evidence that Alexander Vinnik laundered all the missing 600k Goxcoins, of which 300k have been laundered through BTC-e. See flow chart here:  This is also one of the allegations by Greek Authorities and the US federal agencies involved in the take down. Seemingly some of the coins got deposited into internal storage wallets of the exchange, which leaded to their conclusion that the exchange was willingly laundering the heist proceeds maybe even masterminding the theft. There was also the release of a study that concluded that BTC-e was used to launder assets gained from 95% of all cryptoransomware incidents. 
There is a general expectation that if the federal agencies got control of the exchange wallets, that asset forfeiture practices in the US will see those auctioned of. Similar like Silk Road and Hansa, the suspect was arrested without being able to lock-down his electronic devices. Worth noting that the IRS was part of this action.

Now that is a turn of events, that makes the whole MtGox story much more interesting. If BTC-E as an exchange willingly participated in laundering the Goxcoins I sincerely hope their founders are going to rot in US prison, together with every one involved that helped operating whilst being aware of the source of the funds. I wonder why that Bitcoin Mixer suddenly had a change of heart despite the huge profits, did they knowingly participate in laundering as well, whilst putting a blind eye on?

It's not just the US Government. Anti Money Laundering laws are global realities that are enforced through domestic regulators in pretty much all countries. What do you think where global co-operation between law enforcement agencies sources from? law enforcement agencies across the globe had decades to perfect partnership in their global fight against organised crime. If you operate a rogue exchange without any supervision and open it up to the world with no restrictions whatsoever, guess what what, who is going to use it, guess what, who is willing to take those using it down? You have to be a special kind of smart, if part of your operations is also based on services that run out of the US, to allow them to seize your assets. That's on BTC-e and not on the US.
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:56:25
MtGox had 27k people losing 300k BTC to BTC-e. Imagine how differently the crypto world would have been, if BTC-e would have returned those assets... but greed got the better of them.
FinCEN warned everyone about the risks of using unregulated exchanges, stating clearly that they are going for them, no matter how long it takes and where it takes them.
Not their fault if you think, technology makes people untouchable, especially if there's a money trail. Technology is always operated by people, people are taken down all the time and money can be followed. 
There's no tech that can make people using it untouchable, that's the lesson to learn for everyone here.

It might go back online, but what will happen then. Seeing that the US Gov has essentially declared to have BTC-E in its cross-hairs, you are a special kind of mad person if you stay with funds on that platform. Over time BTC-E will be bound to make a mistake that takes them down, if they haven't already in the stir-up.
Good luck to everyone to recover your funds, as someone that has a financial interest in seeing MtGox made whole, I am not wishing anyone to suffer another MtGox. But if BTC-E is proven to have been complicit in laundering the Goxcoins, having been fully aware about the source of the funds, I wish them only the worst.

You do it the same way any foreign financial institution does it nowadays: you have a KYC regime that allows you to verify the identity of your clients based on mutually agreed standards and thus have an instrument to control your client basis and exclude clients that you are unwilling to serve (such as US persons), you comply with international AML standards and practices. Your institution is supervised and regulated through its appropriate domestic financial/monetary authority and its laws and ordinances. etc. etc.

self-declaration isn't enough - as a financial provider you need to verify identity of your clients via KYC in order to control who becomes your client. If a US person is able to become your client through a lie - the US is still coming after you. it's your responsibility as a financial provider to ensure you are not serving US persons. the approach for that is pretty much a mutually agreed standard: KYC/AML and supervision through your local financial/monetary regulator.

this is not about justification. 
this is about how btc-e ignored realities in setting up shop and these realities catched up with them. I would love a world where we wouldn't have to care about US government and do personally disagree with a lot of their nonsense that influences the world, incl. asset forfeiture. But - I would still not drive a car filled with USD 100k of my cash through their coutry, because I know about their practice of asset forfeiture and that could cost me all my cash, if I happen to encounter law enforcement. Governments can enforce their realities and they can back them up in laws and ordinances and if needed with sanctions and war, I cannot (except for voting people into power that share my views), that's why I learn to co-exist. As you most probably will too, regardless of how much that infuriates you or it annoys me, otherwise you risk to continue to lose all your posessions while the US grinds its interests.

This is going to be interesting if true. That's a considerable part of the missing coins, I hope that they can follow the traces and maybe recover some of the missing proceeds of which - hopefully- some might be returned to the MtGox trustee. I assume the sudden closure of Bitmixer.io despite the huge profits due to change in ideology might be related to the detention of the BTC-E founder, I guess some people might find out that, that you cannot run from prosecution. Interesting twist certainly if an exchange was willingly participating in laundering the Gox coins. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:11:53
FATCA isn't a one-way street. 
US financial institutions are also impacted by FATCA, similiar like foreign financial institutions when US source payments are conducted to foreign entities. It's interesting that you mention it, as Florida's private banking industry (the biggest of the world in terms of AUM) has tried to lobby against that rule of FATCA for obvious reasons.
But regardless of FATCA. You might want to check into OECDs automatic exchange of information prorgram, which does something similar as FATCA across all OECD member states. 
The point is, globally there's growing momentum against tax evasion and for the implementation of common reporting standards that are automatically shared across all countries and in the center of all of it sits a strict KYC/AML regime.
As for Delaware, yes, obviously that is an issue due to the way their special court system works and if I understood it correctly, through the way their "scheme" is protected through their state constitution, so it's hard to move against it.
But there's growing opposition within the US against that practice, and bills have been raised (and failed) to root out the secrecy around economical benficiaries of LLCs, and it's inability to be shared with federal agencies. It's only a matter of time until their lobbying efforts fail.

Seeing the value of assets that got seized, there's most probably going to be an announcement with more information as to what will happen to those assets, don't get your hopes up, as careers will be made based on this take-down and FinCEN most likely wants to set a warning example.
Others have said that you most probably will require a lawyer and you will have to proove that your assets weren't connected to illegal activity to hope for any chance to get them out of forfeit status, seeing that your funds might have been tied to a money laundering scheme that ran automatically on the back end side of BTC-E, that might be impossible.
Not having known about BTC-E's laundering scheme most probably is not going to be an argument that is going to shield you, as FinCEN has warned about the risks to use unregulated exchanges in the past, as they might be linked to illegal activity.

I think it's a much better idea to direct that sarcasm at Alex Vinnik and whoever else was involved at BTC-E. Seemingly it was greed that got them involved with illegal activity and that greed ultimately led to their downfall, as it provided the US with all the necessary angles to take them down, if they had focused on running their service on a self-regulated basis, while actively monitoring for illegal activity and denying it, instead of servicing it, maybe they would still be around... it's not like you couldn't have earned a killing that way.

The curse of fast money and relentless greed - when you are young and get to money quick, without having spent decades at work to earn a meager income, struggling to mass any kind of wealth. You don't really understand and appreciate the true value and weight of the funds that you are holding, and which are exposed to your reckless behaviour, until it's gone. Then, when it's lost and you have all that time to sink in, to realise how you had what could have constituted decades of life savings accumulated while doing a fair job, you only realise the true dimension of your "stupidity", but those are the life lessons you never unlearn. Better make them early than late.

FinCEN issued stark warnings that they go after unregulated exchanges, no matter what. That happened live on television during congressional hearings into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies years ago and in written announcements after that.
This also means, that they continue to go after all those that aren't regulated at this time, this includes decentralised exchanges as well, if you think they are safe, you are going to be in for an awakening, when they take down the developers one by one.
How difficult is it to understand their stated intent? It's only a question of time until they have taken down every exchange, that is non-compliant.
If you decide to put your funds onto unregulated exchanges, you are willing to accept that huge counterparty risk, for whatever reason. 
The only safe conclusion can be, to use regulated exchanges, it's simple enough. 
The issues about asset forfeiture were discussed in this sub for years. 
People did warn about using BTC-e and other exchanges in this sub for years too.

It depends, the US is notorious for forfeiting/seizing funds, if they relate or are connected to illegal acitvity. I think it's still unsure if BTC-E has really been taken over by authorities.

I doubt they are going to follow "normal" users, given their numbers, that would be a waste of time, there's also not much political capital to be made from it, I assume they will just seize and forfeit all client assets, which will be a painful enough process for most. They will most likely use all data and the respective transaction logs to build cases in ongoing investigations by following the money trails, as it might prove to be a treasure trove to get an angle/leads into online/crypto gambling platforms, darknet market places, organised crime operating through shell companies, terrorism, etc.
Edit: Well, maybe they could share all transaction data of US persons with IRS, so that they can investigate on tax evasion? But I am not sure if that is possible, that would certainly be a dick move.
Edit2: Seeing the banner has been posted in bitcointalkforum, IRS is part of the investigation, hope everyone reported their tax filings properly. (still assuming only big fish are going to be investigated)

Yeah, left a certain dice site with making 15btc profit, never looked back, still standing strong, there's always the tickle, I am certain most know: try it again and make another 15btc or more, after all you can have near-certain win percentages, it seemed so easy to make cash, but greed isn't a good proposition for investment, chance always ends up turning against you in the long run and you will lose everything. You either never gamble or stop gambling once you are ahead. I was stupid and started to gamble, got lucky and now follow the later rule.

Speculators hyped Bitcoin through pointing out Chinese adoption and favourable regulatory conditions by interpreting Chinese Corporations like Baidu and China Telecom adopting bTC and BTC Viewtime on CCTV as positive signs, the PBOC now moved in and protected it's financial industry and the RMB by declaring BTC a commodity, basically BTC now falls under supervision of the MIIT instead of the PBOC if it had been declared a currency and financial institutions and payment institution are now barred from using it, the market got emotional about it, once Baidu and China Telecom undid their symbolic decisions to accept BTC and the market seemed to have reacted on the unclarity for BTC in China and made a negative interpretation, turning the trend for now down.

Doesn't have to be a real conversion of BTC into USD, i.e. I was thinking more of the amount of bitcoins being displayed in a selectable reference currency so that it let's you better relate to the underlying value, there's anyway the question of how you label prices in BTC and how you accomodate for the price movements against your base currency of accounting (realtime feeds?) and the fact that you still have to be able to label prices in USD, as you are legally required to accept the USD in the USA and in other countries their resp. domestic currency too, I assume. 
It's an interesting thought though, imagine if prices suddenly lose their static quality and were as much in flux as BTC currently is, all price fluctuations to the base currencies are streamed down to all shops and passed on to clients whenever they happen in realtime, it would be like a pulse and you might even get around currency risk that way, if the shop owner has the ability to convert USD into BTC instantely upon a purchase based on the conversion rate on the price tag.

You are assuming that your limit order gets always filled, ignoring the fact that in a rally upwards someone might push the price higher by buying for $920 before your limit buy order gets triggered and filling all the sell orders before your order gets its turn, the market price would sail past your limit buy order without getting filled, especially since BTC order books are shallow compared to regular stock markets - seriously, you are playing a dangerous game, if trading was only that simple by setting a sequence of limit orders.

Instead of dealing with multiple exchanges it might had been wiser to unify powers, in creating one global exchange for bitcoin securities.

Look, they are big corporations that have a standard process in dealing with currencies, accepting a digital commodity instead of a currency is however a process that might not exist on their end, I can imagine that accounting wise there are certain things to clarify, you don't rush into things, before having procedures to support it. So stepping back is the sane thing to do.
Even though barter is legal in most countries, most companies have no internal process to support barter, reason why they tend to accept currencies only, but in theory they could but it is a pain to deal with, a digital commodity changes a lot, as it behaves like a currency - so in a way, supporting barter might be suddenly an interesting proposition, even though it will functional be not that different from trading with currency.

Well at the end of the day a tip transfers value to the one that is getting tipped (similar like reddit gold), so it does offer a difference to LOL or THIS - it's the same principle that once applied to Bitcoin when it wasn't much worth at all and people were tipping outside of their sub. Aside of that, there are Bitcoin users that checked into Dogecoin because of these tips, instead of just brushing it off as retarded, simply because they got tipped, so it creates value for Dogecoin, which improves the community over there, which in the end benefits Bitcoin as well, seeing that the demographic at Dogecoin consists mainly of people that weren't really interested in cryptocoins at all (calling the subs here way too serious and money focused or people that simply failed to understand the basics and didn't think this sub particularly helpful and supportive) and which might transit over to other coins, once they get more proficient and interested into the money aspect. One of the explanations why people are tipping "nonsensical" amounts, they want to get a feel for it, or haven't much of a balance at all, you have five year olds tipping around, are you prohibiting them to have fun - are you calling their learning experience retarded? Maybe you should consider that the aspect of fun to share coins is something you shouldn't reject that quickly, when it comes to forming communities around these coins. a network effect always comes with a community that adopts it. Also RES gives you enough instruments to work against the "pollution" if you really want to avoid it.

I doubt that crypto whales would have deep enough pockets for the recent movements, look at crypto coin market cap  for all the altcoins, even not taking LTC into consideration it has risen a couple of hundred million USD since beginning of this week, across all coins, I don't think that we have whales around, that would dispose over these levels of funds. the biggest LTC wallet controlled merely 8MM USD before the rise, DPRs 144K BTC were considered a lot, check out the BTC caps on all the altcoins, no there's some big rivers of FIAT moving into crypto, who knows what its source is from.

Because these USB cables are only used for selective actions, 50 of them cost 200k, I suggest checking out this panel speech, which gives you a lot of insight about the whole thing 
Also they talk a lot about their devices being built from off the shelves components, i.e. so that is nearly impossible to trace them back to the NSA, as everyone could potentially have built it, reason why you don't see NSA specific hardware out in the field (I am sure it's different on their on-site locations)
Basically we got owned, the whole internet seems to have been set in a state that it can be compromised through the NSA on such a fundamental layer, that there is no easy way to counter it. Some way to counter some of the elements highlighted in Quantumtheory were pondered to have all internet traffic encrypted, but even then, it's just a question of time until the NSA finds other intrusion vectors.
What is even more scary is that the information that now surfaced is back from 2006, so seven years have passed meanwhile, which is like an eternity
The only way against this, is political pressure. Sadly I don't think that will happen. If the USA ever shifts into a state of open tyranny, you are going to have a hard time, 1984 isn't a nightmare anymore, thus reality we now live in, is even worse.

Even if the price is factor four above compared to April, volumes back in that one week in April were factor 14 above those of today, so you will still end up with a bigger turn-over back then, not even talking about the subsequent three weeks which moved again 2.7MM coins. The last five weeks have seen a total of 1.2MM coins moved on MtGox. I rest my case, volume's are far, far away from the volatility levels back in April and the majority of BTC were held and not sold, if there are no further negative news, this is going to recover within weeks.

There's also an important argument, which isn't rational but emotional, that wasn't brought up would be confidence/trust in bitcoin, which is its most important quality and which at the same time makes it also so vulnerable, many people don't put up the time to understand bitcoin, especially people that aren't invested yet, as such they listen to others what they say about it and that forms an image, ponzi scheme is what you face all the time when you speak with people, it supports terrorists and crime seems to be another slogan and there's countless more. it's possible to destroy confidence in bitcoin, which would hinder it from ever moving into mainstream, so one of the major issues that bitcoin has to tackle is working on its image to the outside and educating people on its qualities. unfortunately most media traction seems to nowadays come from its speculative qualities and people's intention to cash out and retire on it, even a lot of bitcoin speculators only see bitcoin's quality as a currency substitute, which is sad really.

Weak hands tend to sell on weekends, too much time to reflect on your fortunes, especially in view of bitcoin not getting a free parade to the finish line from regulatory institutions. Expect some serious movements this weekend. Anyways, the fundamental technology behind bitcoin is sound and will turn it to success at some point of time, there's still a major global finance crisis out there with huge asset and debt bubbles nearly everywhere, once they implode, you will see how bitcoin surges again, i.e. we lost a fight but not the battle.
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:46:48
There's a reason why bitcoins have been so well adopted in areas with a) high inflation (Argentina) b) foreign currency restrictions  (China) c) enforcements that annexed your savings through taxes (Cyprus) -&gt; they all point towards features of bitcoin that makes it potentially valuable over fiat currency: it's not controlled by fiscal policies and government control and it's limited in availability, which might make it work as a vessel to conserve wealth.
Now there's certain risks: mainly everywhere where bitcoin interfaces with fiat currencies, that are not dealt with in person, but over exchange systems, we are stuck with choke points that can and will be more strictly and costly regulated through government controls, seeing that mostly everyone is operating in grey areas, this represents a huge risk, it's a weakness until bitcoin, is more widely adopted and spread as a currency system and people start to shift their mindset as speculators that just want to cash out into fiat, into believers that think that bitcoin is going to be a substitute that remains. Until then bitcoin is vulnerable and speculators are going react nervously on every itch, that might threaten its future.
Adoption is properly going to be interfered with through lobbying of the existing fiat industry, once perspective shifts that bitcoin is not a novelty item, but is going to stay to last, there is going to be a standoff, as the current fiat industry is not going to have much of a future if bitcoin ever manages to install itself over fiat, I am pretty pessimistic about the outcome, except for if opportunity is seen and there's a counterweight that is heavy enough to hold against that industry, this could be China or Russia, but it's not in there interest either, to lose control over their domestic currency. 
Then, there's the current growth rates, which make it currently unpredictable and difficult to use for pricing in mainstream business, seeing that prices will have to factor in fiat conversion rates if accounting is done in regular currency, bitcoin might also have a hard stance everywhere where business is done over the counter, as more than one payment system might be too expensive to keep, also usability might be an issue, not talking about the tech sawy users, but the ones that aren't even able to utilise an ATM. 
As more fiat currency is converted into bitcoins, prices will continue to soar but seeing that availability is limited and demand is going to increase, swings should become less of an issue once bitcoin has found its true market value and adoption progresses and with it the believe that it might hold it's place.
My 2 cents, apols if they don't make sense, not being an expert myself.

I think it's the fact that it is still unclear what stance governments are going to take vs. Bitcoin, because it hasn't grown yet to a size, where it is seen as a problem to the current system that fuels the status quo. The fiat industry hasn't even started to actively lobby against Bitcoin yet, this will change, once a certain threshold is passed and they see their business in danger, you can be sure that they won't act differently than other industries that have become threatened by new substituting technology, a result will be a full regulatory clampdown on the choke points, which represent the biggest weakness of Bitcoin, i.e. the exchanges, that conveniently translate FIAT into BTC and vice versa, costs to run these are going to increase a lot and they will be put under supervision, the way how anyone can setup an exchange today, that is going to change, you will have to get licences and become accredited, natural persons might be shut from dealing directly on these exchanges and financial institutions like banks/brokers might be required to become intermediaries to the exchanges. Also domestic tax authorities might start to see BTC as a blind spot and might introduce stricter rules as to how you have to report your earnings etc., this all has the potential to negatively impact credibility of Bitcoin.

Baidu is a large corporation, while accepting new currencies is a fairly well understood process from an accounting perspective, accepting a virtual commodity (which basically comes down to barter, which is perfectly legal in many countries) might raise some questions that need to be clarified first. Anyone having worked in a bigger corporation understands that new procedures take time and cannot be implemented over night, especially when what people thought was a currency has changed its classification overnight to virtual commodity and switched regulator from what people thought ought to be PBOC to what is now MIIT.
So stepping back and waiting for further guidance from MIIT shouldn't come as a surprising move to anyone and it doesn't mean that Baidu has given-up on Bitcoin &amp; Co.

Again, a big opportunity for cryptocurrencies to show that they don't need catalysts (Silk Road, USA, Baidu, China) to sustain themselves, if BTC can manage to keep a fair value (whatever that is) it might strengthen perception that the idea behind cryptocurrencies is here to last, even if nations like China are banning them from interacting with their local currencies, if not, back to the drawing board, to devise a better way that allows capital influx without exposing yourself to financial regulation.
Remember that everyone expected the finance service industry to battle against cryptocurrencies at some stage, behind the finance service industry, you have fiscal policies of nations driven by a vast interest to remain in control, so what we are currently experiencing is a fight to not lose control.
I suspect many of the regulators have been briefed by their finance industry experts about the danger of cryptocurrencies to their respective systems, being made aware about the potential to destabilize what is anyways a unstable market, what we are seeing is essentially the start of active lobbysm against cryptocurrencies and it is happening through the backdoor, in meetings that aren't made public.
We need to grow our habitats, mesh cryptocurrency based micro-networks wherever possible, to support local communes enabling lasting benefits through the use of cryptocurrencies and then develop a constant stream of success stories that go viral, we need to strenghten that movement that has grown from bottom up, we need to nurture the ideas behind cryptocurrencies and inject them into society. We need to win hearts and have people in this with the bottom of their souls.

Honestly, alts have been around for years, do you see all of reddit getting cluttered with tips? It's not like dogecoin was the first to have the idea to tip people for exposure, bitcoin spearheaded that idea and back then, BTC was the same equivalent of nothing, did ppl make a fuzz about it back then? No, people were curious. Is the bitcoin community nowadays tipping the same amount as before? No. I don't see the danger that you see, because that spirit of tipping doesn't come with every altcoin, it sources from a community. And most of the altcoins do lack that kind of community that came with dogecoin, also once the value of a coin goes up, the willingness to tip unfortunately seems to naturally fade out, so the excitement is going to fade out, just like it did with bitcoin. Honestly, I hope bitcoin is more open-minded than this, because we are not in a position yet that we can afford to clamp ourselves down.

This is not true, read up on barter, it's perfectly legal in most western countries, it's just not commonly done, as it's more convenient to use money.

nearly 14k BTC have been sold, that's why the price went down, not clear if just one person cashed out, or more of them - anyways price bounced back to USD 207
If you sell all your stuff, do it in incrementals while riding the lift, whoever went with that cash out, lost a lot of potential extra cash.

There's a couple of stories like that, people made money at just-dice, buckloads of it, the trouble is, most of them get hooked, as the process feels so easy, cash on the street, that seemingly just waits to be picked up, so most tend to come back, just for another roll and another - and lose everything over time, doesn't help that a mouse click and a BTC figure isn't a good medium for you to relate to what you have at stake. it was sad to listen to some of these people breaking down on chat over there and ofc, most try martingales, encouraged by the stories of all those winners, that run positive balances.
Btw: back then these were 7000 BTC, go figure, how that guy must have felt when BTC was USD 1242 per coin.

You should get your facts straight, listen to this panel: and educate yourself about QUANTUMTHEORY, i.e. the information that is available, this is more than just simple Jailbreaking it's an array of instruments at disposal of the NSA (physical access is just one element). 
Also to set a fact straight: Applebaum isn't saying Apple participated, he is actually pointing out the fact that Apple only joined PRISM after Jobs died, but because of the claim that the NSA is making, that iOS products are 100% vulnerable to QUANTUMTHEORY, he thinks it's rather unlikely that they haven't participated as it otherwise wouldn't speak well of their product. 
One of his main points is, if US corporations didn't willingly participate to soften their products for QUANTUMTHEORY, it means that the NSA possesses knowledge about major exploits to hardware and software that they aren't sharing, which could make it more secure, so the NSA is accepting the risk that others might also take advantage of these exploits, hurting everyone in the process.
It's a fucking disgrace, as many Internet security standards through the CNSS (Committee on National Security Systems) have been developed and designed with NSA participation and the NSA also approves every Network Equipment Vendors for the Telecom Industry in the USA.
















Also Cisco Security Certifications have been designed with guidance of the CNSS and NSA:

Businesses can accept Bitcoins, ever heard of barter? Perfectly legal in most western countries and I am sure that china has a good grasp about it too... taking their history in account. yes, paying in RMB is obviously more convenient than exchanging goods, but Bitcoin has now been classified a digital commodity that behaves like a currency, so barter is suddenly an interesting proposition, as BTC doesn't have the common drawbacks that come with physical goods, the coming weeks are going to be interesting to see what kind of services are going to be created around it.

BTC-E is the only exchange, that I am aware off, that features a well populated chat box, which poses a terrific platform for market manipulation - and is used as such, you always have "pump &amp; dump" patterns (people dropping their holdings in joint actions on market price peaks in order to buy back in when the market price drops considerable, or artificial price increases, which then are cashed out) that are flanked by chat messages that try to spread hysteria &amp; panic, by spreading false facts, links to fake news, or simply untrue messages and rumours. 
Unfortunately it seems to work, user pool has increased from what was 2k last month, to now about 11k, especially new holders seem to fall for these artificial market price slips, while there's considerable people preying on these.
Also, it's used by a number of whales, using the market manipulation to their advantage: there's at least one active user on LTC, that holds around USD 1MM worth in LTC and was using this position to block several times the ask price movements by enacting a 100k LTC sell wall that locked movements and was pulled at some point.  
BTC-E also did some shaddy stuff last week, when announcing to delist TRC and FTC, FTC seemed to have been an error, needless to say there were brutal price swings, that made some people quite some profit.
BTC-E unfortunately builds a case for those, that request tighter regulation for crypto-currencies and proper supervision. It's chat serves as a textbook example how its users abuse chat in ways that would be a direct offense against the Securities Exchange Act that regulates market manipulation.

Would you have said the same on stocks back on Black Thursday 1929 when the stock markets melted, calling everyone out on their failing diversification strategies on their stock portfolios, claiming why didn't you stick with gold? Still why are people talking about diversification of your stock portfolios even nowadays and why is not everyone in gold today?
Well, there's risks that you cannot diverse against if you remain in the same asset class. Cryptocurrencies being declared a commodity by the Chinese and the reaction of the market on these news, is a risk that you cannot diverse against through Cryptocurrencies, that should be obvious to everyone, but you have future risks within market fluctuations of cryptocurrencies, you can diverse against by making investments in altcoins, maybe if you try to think hard you might discover some of them.

Not necessary, speculation helps laying a foundation that tends to yield lasting benefits later on, see .com bubble, which helped to establish the market perception for investing into e-commerce and it's benefits. in the same (but much smaller) way, speculation currently helps to drive the re-distribution of fiat denominated wealth over into crypto currencies, with increasing capital, so do investments follow into business opportunities which in return improve market adoption and market perception through building services and features around crypto currencies that mimic the infrastructure that fuels fiat currency or even innovate on them.

If you think that Quarkcoin popping is only going to have an isolated impact on people having invested in Quarkcoin, you are terribly wrong: the demise of Quarkcoin would be all over the news and a case would be build that the same applies to all other cryptocurrencies incl. Bitcoin. People argueing that BTC is a ponzi scheme, would just say BTC is a ponzi scheme just like QRK, furthermore it could have potential negative consequences from regulatory entities around the world along the way: we said so.
Market confidence is a fragile thing, reason why there's so much regulation in the finance service industry, that ultimately want's to avoid sudden spikes and drops.

buy in smaller shapes while the price sinks, that way your average purchase price of your total holding goes down and you benefit from the discount through a sinking market price and aren't going to miss the take off, obviously it demands a certain liquidity and you betting on an uptrend, otherwise you should cut your loss, if you feel it's over... or you are in for the longterm, just let it sit and wait a couple of months, years.

it has good sides though, china's approval was more and more becoming a focal point of the state of bitcoin, as such there's the chance to show that regardless what china decides people keep believing in the idea behind bitcoin, similar like with silk road, this can raise confidence, ofc it can also crash down to the gates of hell.
People should also remember the basic idea behind bitcoin, i.e. people send BTC directly to people without financial institutions being able to lock you out or having any other influence. You can still do exactly that.

Bitcoins will probably still be around when you have become food for worms.
Back in September, the price of one BTC was around USD 120 - we are still more than 700% above that, far from finished.
Better stop pretending to be Gordon Gecko and hold onto your coins that you purchased with money that you hopefully made sure you could afford to lose, these coins might still be able to surprise you one or two years down the road.

Isn't bitcoin more than just a digital currency &amp; have we still not accepted that one of the key developments is the blockchain and why does the ability of bitcoin to store value need to be stable, and what is meant if we speak about stability, on what timeframe are we measuring stability? Isn't there fluctuation in everything else as well, fueled by supply and demand if you only look at the right timeframe? Stock prices aren't stable, Oil Prices aren't stable, the Gold price isn't stable, the economy has recently shown signs of being unstable, the USD is not stable in view of inflation and last I saw Treasuries have also fluctuated in yield rates - yes, price osciliation for bitcoins seem to be worse, but it has shown a tremendous resistance in view of recent developments, which I think has surprisen a lot of people and which finally starts to freak them out. People that are perfectly fine with the current system, suddenly see a risk. Who is to say, can't "stability" improve once crypto currencies are much more widely adopted and wouldn't there be a good chance that their application from being a subject of speculation, as they currently are used, could shift to whatever purpose it can fulfill thanks to developments that factor the blockchain in mind? It sounds more like a clash of fear about the unknown, as we suddenly navigate a possibility that we cannot fathom with established models, thus bitcoin is evil - it sounds a bit like the logic that was built around the axis of evil, which in the end lead to desaster.

look at it this way, had you spent 2k+ on approx. 200 shares back in 1984 for Microsoft, your investment would have been worth USD 1.2MM in 99 when it was on its peak, sometimes you don't need to spent much, you just need to keep holding and remain patient, which is much more difficult, when you are invested big. Seeing the potential w. bitcoin, you could do fairly well 10 years from now, you could also have lost everything.

Yeah, but see it from WU's perspective:

Bitcoin currently interfaces with Fiat to shift wealth, if you ban Fiat from the exchange process... let's say bitcoin is going to have it difficult - sadly all it requires is a G10/20 meeting - issue is that nations do have a multitude of interests vetted into their currencies (some say the history of currencies goes back to the need to finance wars and was not born as a means to enable better trade), they aren't going to drop these without a fight, if Bitcoin ever manages to attract the level of traction that is necessary to be regarded as a threat.
All we can hope is that we fly under the radar long enough and transform society quickly enough into adopting it, while creating serious benefits in the process, so that it is going to be too late to stop it from happening.
All we can do is, push for adoption, if there was a chance to transform society (as sensationalist that might sound) this is the chance of a lifetime... so people just seeing it as a way to get rich are missing the bigger picture, this is about enriching everyone's life.

It now also falls under regulation of the MIIT
For people that don't know what the MIIT is:
It's the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China and it has been formed in 2008 and is responsible for regulation and development of the postal service, Internet, wireless, broadcasting, communications, production of electronic and information goods, software industry and the promotion of the national knowledge economy and includes the former Commissions:
-  Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense
-  The State Council Informational Office
- State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau
It's minister is Miao Wei, who transformed Dongfeng Motor and drove it back to profitability.
From an entrepreneur perspective it feels better to be regulated from there than the PBOC.

I think we are still having the most crazy time ahead of us, I am totally agreeing with what is said here, bitcoin is going vertical next year or the year after, what you have seen until now is nothing, compared to what is going to happen more forward, I am also thinking that a lot of altcoins will make a similar development, it's a good time to be invested in coins, if you have the discipline to hold and not convert them into FIAT, and start to use them.
