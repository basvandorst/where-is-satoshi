hmm i get you. but instead of 5 coins, i was thinking, if i were to diversify, i would just stay with bitcoin, ether and litecoin. anything else worth investing in, according to your investments over the year?
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:03:35

@_date: 2017-10-03 14:27:45
if I create this electrum wallet on my mac, would I still be able to access my bitcoins from my android phone using the app?
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:24:24
