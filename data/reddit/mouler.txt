If you were buying with dollars I'd say Gemini is a good place to buy although the are a few newer options. Robinhood Crypto is new and fee free right now. If you are talking really small amounts of money, LocalBitcoins.com might be a good option for you.

Generating a key, printing it out and sending coin to it is using a paper wallet. Using any website or service to create one for you is risky as they can keep a copy of the key and steal your coin when they want to.

Yep. Best way to avoid such accusation would be to regenerate a matching QR and post the link to compare, I guess.

My bad. Apparently Gyft doesn't deal with Wal-Mart anymore.
I'd post an ad to buy on localbitcoins, rather than just looking around for someone that already accepts them.
I'd also be willing to trade you Bitcoin for it. I'm sure there are others like me.

Remember that Coinbase is essentially a legacy adapter. They adhere to both USD fiat protocol and Bitcoin.

If newegg has a breach of customer data you need to get a new card number issued, review your transactions, dispute, etc. Never the case with Bitcoin.
There are advantages on both sides. The discount in cost of transaction and insurance means lower cost of goods (or more seller profit), so for now I will gladly take the 10% Newegg/Bitcoin discount, faster transaction, and zero risk of data theft.

Just as with a stock being a slice of ownership that doesn't change, a Bitcoin is an undilutable fraction of the whole.
Fiat always declines in worth as the supply grows. Backed currencies fluctuate with commodity backing changes. The only currency system that is truely stable is one that cannot be counterfeited, cannot be diluted, and has no intrinsic value that leads to use for other than money.
One Bitcoin will forever be 1/21,000,000 of all bitcoins.
US Dollars fluctuate wildly in the rate of their inflation/dilution, especially with QE-ulimited, trade restrictions, fractional reserve lending and the use of those loans due as assets. 
Gold fluctuates as we really have no idea how much there actually is, plus changes in mining ability or cost. Its use as a metal also changes the amount useable as a medium of trade.
@_date: 2014-07-23 10:36:14
Fiat is more stable than Bitcoin if your only measure of valuation of Bitcoin is fiat equivalency. Exchange rates are based on demand and transaction costs with buy/sell lag and spikes due to large volume transactions.
Your argument is the same as saying stock in a large company is less stable than a fiat currency. You are buying something typically valued in one means, more accurately described in another metric. Stock value fluctuates both on what the shares represent as control  AND the market demand for the shares. Stock valuation can fluctuate wildly based on buy/sell demand, but always represents the same percentage share of the company.

It's all a bunch of middlemen. 
You are correct. Until more merchants start doing like newegg did and offering a Bitcoin discount (reflection of their lower cost) there isn't likely to be a mass adoption.
Bitcoin is pretty convient for those of us that are both users and long time investors.
Not much more convenient than PayPal, and no returns in the case of a dispute though.
@_date: 2014-07-18 02:03:44
You could also try localbitcoins.
@_date: 2014-07-17 09:43:02
Of course. This is why you never trust non-open source software. 
A piece of software that stores a private key for you could easily send that private key off to a developer any time it calls home (updates, error logs, etc). If the software is open source it is pretty easy to examine how things work, and experienced security pros usually call out devs on things like that pretty quickly.
Never trust anything you didn't build for yourself.
I would also worry about some of the online wallet key generators, wallets, etc. Not as much as I worry about my local bank screwing up my deposits again though.

Creating a larger BTC paying customer base would contribute more to the current problem.
Only when merchants can pay their suppliers directly in Bitcoin (as opposed to various fiat or fiat/fait conversions) will the current problem of immediate Bitcoin sales be reduced.
The necessary evil reference is more an obligatory unplesantness, so I hereby aplogise for my exaggeration. 
Other obligatory unpleasantness would include school children using rulers marked in both inches and meters, signs in multiple languages, etc. Until a unified standards are achieved legacy systems must be supported. Some systems are naturally slower to change.

depending on what you want to do with your Bitcoin, I suggest two options.
1) Coinbase, or any US based exchange. Coinbase offers mobile apps, and is subject to US trade and banking regulations. You are fairly safe keeping your coins with them and using them on the go.
2) Read reviews of open-source apps built for whatever device you want to use. Look for reviews of the developers behind it. Consider an app that will generate a new key pair and create a paper wallet. Do this while offline, and clear the print buffer when you are done (pretty darn safe) then wipe the app and all its stored data. This is great for long term storage (consider a material more durable than paper, ok?).
The problems related to keeping private keys safe are nothing new. You should really spend a few minutes reading up on pubic key cryptography and use in daily life.

Purchasing power is still an applicable term when the quantity of goods and services tradeable for one unit is limited not in quantity of a single good, but in variety of goods due to limited acceptance of a currency. Not the primary definition, but still correct.
@_date: 2014-08-14 15:11:37
The immidiate fiat conversions are a necessary evil. As a larger acceptance of BTC is realized, more of those merchants should be paying more of their bills in BTC to save even more. 
Dollars didn't beat out gold in a day.

Found money and illegal gains are taxable, yes. Good luck auditing found pennies. 
I'm the case of finding less than $0.50 total, you round down any way so it doesn't count
@_date: 2018-06-17 16:33:48
That penny is also tax free if you consider each event to be a separate earning. This makes that 3 second event comparable to earning $22/hr taxed (about 18/hr net) which is around US median income. Never mind that you might be billing that time or on the clock with your normal employment at the time, so it is still very worth while. 
However, the abundance of loose pennies in my house has made raising a toddler very frustrating. YMMV
@_date: 2018-06-17 16:35:16
What's wrong with earning both at the same time for a few seconds?
@_date: 2019-12-21 22:34:37
No, actually if what you pay for electricity is the same or slightly lower rate than if you were buying the same amount of crypto, yes you literally have free heat. 
That all depends on mining efficiency, but the price of various coins is somewhat tied to the energy cost to mine, so if you have relatively efficient mining hardware and wanted the crypto you've saved yourself various other market transaction fees vs purchase.
