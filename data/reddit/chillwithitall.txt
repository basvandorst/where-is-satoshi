Even Stallman/FSF have an opinion on that term. They prefer FLOSS - Free Libre Open Source Software - because at least it referencing the freedom side of things.

As far as MS is concerned, due to legal reasons with a German supermarket I believe - it was never called Metro. But yeah everyone else just called it Metro

Being on the bleeding edge of hardware with Linux can be a blessing and a curse. You got the curse.

Oh dear it has been a year since that came out?! I am out of the loop.
I agree a 2D fallback should work, that is the typical behaviour. So Im interested to see what is going on.

That is definitely the plan. That said I don't think MS has the strangle hold on games like they used too. While they are trying to get people with their exclusive content, they haven't been able to get many really sticky hits in the last few years. The only one that has any staying power is Minecraft and even then only because they kept it multiplatform.
Don't get me wrong, MS is still a power house but they don't have everyone cornered like in the 90's and 2000's. Vulkan is the first major crack that they are struggling to contain. After they tried to subjugate and kill off OpenGL, those involved learned a valuable lesson. Every time you beat someone, you teach them a lesson.
Satya Nadella over there is a smart guy and keying in on digital jails such as online services and games is a smart tactic for keeping people locked into Windows. The growth of operating systems in terms of user base and functionality is very limited nowadays and they risked people looking elsewhere if they didn't jump beyond just the base software packages.
