Good one, and sadly, true.
Had a payment from Moon Bitcoin today, been over an hour and only one confirmation thus far.

I think that creating of "national payment system" will take them ages..at least normal one!

"Bitcoin’s code is well written, but not the level of a mature Linux release. These mature versions are the ones large organisations use. When investing in Bitcoin, be aware the software is still developing." I don't see how investment and developing are connected. The fact that bitcoin code is still being edit doesn't affect it's safety.

Personally, I think it's not a bad idea, but it somehow has smth to do with ads on page, e.g if you click "tip" you don't have ads for one day.

I've pondered this question on an off for a good year now...   My thinking is that at the moment, a 50 or 25 virgin block is worth about 50.1 / 25 coins ..  in 20 years however, the Numismic value of a virgin block (technically the private key for said block) will be off the charts ...This is simply because of the rarity and the fact that from now till the end of eternity, nevermore will a 50 virgin coin block be minted.  
Just take a look here:    ... there a lowly pennies out there worth $100,000
Soo.. anyone out there with virgin 50 coin keys they wanna sell?

Nice pic. By the time bitcoin will become the financial system of the future.

nice comics! love catwoman! sometimes it's nice to hear about bitcoin from the place your never expected to mention it!

If bitcoin is an experiment it's a good one! Even it's not the worlds currency number one it's still getting popular!
@_date: 2014-06-08 09:58:36
Agree, let's try and see, while it is still not so popular and the  damage would not be so immense.

On April 2013, then i started to collect BTC from faucet. 
I also remember selling my 0.3BTC for about ~$30 on September 2013, that was a really bad decision, if only i sell it on November 2013 i would've got $300

The idea in whole is good..but when paying, even small amount I prefer to know what i pay for. It would be good a good idea to post some pages of the book.

The reason to move from Ghash.io if i own more coins there.

Sooner or later that should have been happened as closing silk road gave a chance to small drug companies to become big ones.

It's a bit wrong to compare PayPal and bitcoin. PayPal is a service providing transactions between seller and customer and bitcoin is just kind of money.
@_date: 2014-05-02 05:03:02
The article is not about blocking transactions of all porn professionals, but only a couple of them who tried to sell webcam videos. So the title is a bit misleading.
@_date: 2014-05-08 14:26:00
Just read the article and didn't find any solution, just one sentence "If one wants to make a totally anonymous transaction — which one might want to do if funding extremism — cash is the way to do it" but the same way you can do with any currency.

So that it is, a Digibyte. Advertisement work, there are at least 2 people more that know of it now.

The general public don't have the kind of funding and insight to create something so great. Bitcoin sas to be a government project with deep pocket.
