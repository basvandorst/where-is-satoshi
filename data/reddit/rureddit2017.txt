Joke that since pretty much all crypto pricing is pure speculation at this point, that the true value of the utility of crypto maybe 5 dollars or 50000 dollars per average coin. So to say 300 billion left the market is to say there was 300 billion there to begin with.

@_date: 2017-02-16 15:56:05
im at work when I get home ill actually put this data in and objectively determine if its exponential. The growth rate has to be increasing at an increasing rate thats proportional to size. You cant really eyeball it. The definition of "increasing at increasing rate" wasnt a good definition. I also dont know the actual importance of picking a select few platforms looking at bitcoin as a whole I wouldnt really describe any of it as exponential 
Total Trading Volume
 
Velocity of Bitcoin
Number of transactions per day

Ok I dont know how many ways to say it, what you just said here is the definition of exponential growth. If something increases and the rate it increases also increases then it will always have best fit trend that adheres to form f(x)=b^x. If however the rate of increases reduces, stagnates etc then "rate of increase continues to experience increase itself" is not true.


No when a company says they are experiencing "exponential growth" and they are not based on accepted definition then they are simply stretching the truth to market themselves to look better then they are. Which all companies do. Have you ever turned on a TV and saw an advertisement........ They wont be saying they are experiencing exponential growth if they are sitting in an investor meeting with people with half a brain
Which is exactly what I am saying here. This is not exponential growth, and simply taking a looser definition because of bias isnt "commonly accepted".

I mean its far too early to pull a I told you so. 30% is a pretty bold claim. A full on international recession with the collapse of the housing market resulted in a 50% drop. I dont know how in the world you came up with that 30% figure. I would argue that the current drop is less about over valued stock and more about the destruction of or withdrawal from large multinational trade agreements, like TPP, a poorly structured tax cut, which funnels money to the ultra rich, and away from the middle class. It also creates a vast increase in the deficit with no real stimulus bump and there are talks of rising interest rates. Really that and overall uncertainty due to all the bat shit crazy going on in the US
That said....... I 100% agree with your future take on crypto, but that has nothing to do with the price of tea in china (the value or overvalue of stocks)

You are using terminology you dont actually understand. When talking about EV is under scenario in which you can choose what to do with the 1K. The expected value of 1000 USD that you dont get to keep doesnt change if you convert it or not.....
The whole thing you cant seem to understand is you are not keeping this 1k either way, so there is no benefit or cost to what form you lose it in

Do you know the definition of volatility.... 
Graph of past year
To give you an idea of how volatile bitcoin is for comparison, the volatility of gold averages around 1.2%, while other major currencies average between 0.5% and 1.0%.
I guess if you look at whole history of bitcoin yes volatility is down, but comparing it to the wild west of pre-2014 with double digit percentage points in volatility isnt really a fair analysis.  Until these large swings are minimized adoption for legitimate use as a currency is going to be stagnated. 
Don't get me wrong, I am a big proponent of bitcoin,  but if you want it to actually succeed cant have blind faith. Need the fundamentals, HODLER is a fun and all and makes a quick buck but a currency strength is defined by stability, velocity, and adoption. I dont get excited at huge swings, I get excited at new technology advances that will allow bitcoin to scale, adoption and used and increase in transaction rates. Those are the characteristics that will make BTC succeed no speculative price increases

@_date: 2017-09-19 17:37:06
Paper 1: You miss associated increase with volume and market cap. Obviously volatility decreases with increase in supply as shifts due to buying and selling have less total effect.


No where does it correlate market cap with volatility. 
Paper 2: Talk about cherry picking.... you are mad i picked past year this paper is basing volatility decreases from Aug 2010 to you guessed it Jan 2016, the lowest point in volatility pretty much in bitcoins existence (and low point in market cap from then until now and doesnt to take into account the entire huge increase in market cap this past year)
Paper 3: 


Bitcoin Market Volatility Analysis Using Grand Canonical Minority Game (PDF Download Available). Available from:  [accessed Sep 19, 2017].
In no way talks about volatility in relation to market cap or even that volatility is going down with market cap. Its a paper explaining a hypothesis of why bitcoin IS volatile. This paper has nothing to do with this discussion
Article (link 4):
Literally top bullet point


What point does this prove? Yes bitcoin recovered..... at about 20% less then its peak. This is definition of volatility
Paper 5: From 2015, it looking at volatility, from 2010 to mid 2015 then easy look at the volatility graph I posted and you would see that this was the lowest point in volatility pretty much in the entire history of bitcoin. Volatility has not been that low ever since then...... So again doesnt help your case
Even after all the points I made, our discussion was market cap effect on volatility not that volatility is going down (which its not). Nothing you have posted supports your claim.... have you read through these. I am open to you sourcing what part of these sources you feel supports your claim. Im not trolling think Ive shown that by providing sources and even more so not just links but making my points with specific examples

Im glad we came to agreement, very rarely does that happen in reddit arguments. My frustration was the concept of "taking a huge loss by paying with  BTC". Your argument at first wasnt once all things being equal there was no benefit. I agree from a purely selfish standpoint, there no benefit to converting, but the loss is pretty much negligent other then time it takes to convert.


Sorry have to do one last point, again your not keeping the EV so doesnt make a difference. If anything this is a positive, because if it some how increases in value from time you convert to before you send you just made money. But if you send it and a day later it doubles in value you still havent loss that EV because the rent was due day before and you werent going to have a chance at the EV anyway. The only risk is if it drops in value before sending which isnt something you seem concerned with
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:06:47
Ok so the user was rambling about how you completely lose out on huge gains by paying with BTC......
Also in the two options you described is one inherently better then the other? Or is it exactly what i was arguing where it makes no real difference. Except you know one is the first ever recorded use of BTC as a currency that set BTC up for what it is today, the other well buying a pizza. 
In rent scenario it makes no difference either way but using BTC further legitimizes it and adds to increase in adoption

Id be happy to pick multiple time periods when market cap increasesed and volatility didnt go down. You are saying because I picked a period in which market cap increased that it isnt valid that volitility didnt go down as you said it would. 
Why look at more then past year, a large large large majority of the market cap increase has happened in past year. 
So how about this lets look at whole thing
**Bitcoin volatility since inception***
**Market cap since inception***
You are the one that said as market cap increases volitility decreases....... There is nothing to show that correlation on any time scale. There are many points in past were volitility was lower or near what it is now with 1/1000000 of the market cap. How about you actually make a legitimate arguement then simply saying im wrong. Its not my job to prove your point its yours. Logic 101
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:43:42
I said I was out when you were literally saying nothing but "you are wrong". You decided to actually try to back up your point with sources I have made my points about your sources now it's your turn to make argument countering that, which doesn't not involve "your wrong" and "your a newb" and "go find answer yourself" 
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:54:05
Pick any time period of consistent market cap shift (up or down) and then look at volatility its literally opposite correlation to what you claim
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:30:00
Thats why I made the post about it being an example of whats wrong with subreddit. For BTC to succeed it cant keep being treated like a speculative asset, it needs adoption and rational backers. HODLER even as a concept is not great in reality. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:40:23
How do you not realize going out and buying 50000 worth of gold at time of sale to pay is no different then paying 50000 in cash..... Or for landlord it's no different then if OP payed in cash and the landlord went and bought BTC instead of OP there is no winners or losers. How the fuck do you think Bitcoin can operate as a currency that you have such a hard on for if using it is as such is a "sucker move"............. You are literally contridicting the main reason you believe Bitcoin will increase in value 


At the time you paid in usd, your coin is worth the same as the usd. Nothing is stopping you from taking the usd you saved by paying in coin and buying the same amount of coin................
Probably should stay away from Bitcoin investing if this concept is difficult for you. Your cult like hardon for bitcoin is going to get you in trouble if you throw all logic to the wind when thinking about it.. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:12:37
Guessing at what market cap of bitcoin increased dramatically in the past year. From May 2016 to now market cap was nearly doubled, at that same time last year its volitility index was the lowest point its between since. Which completely counters your argument. Stop with the lazy arguing and just saying im wrong
**Market Cap May 2016 - Present**
**Bitcoin volitility index May 2016- Present**
You are the epitome logical fallacy and bad debate. Your response to everything is you are wrong with no supporting facts. I show you that volatility has increased over past year. Market cap doubles and volatility is higher then it was before the increase.....
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:18:25
Who says anything about turning their back on BTC. I want BTC to succeed and in such need for people to act in its interest. Spewing nonesense and literally arguing for it not to be used as a currency does not help BTC.


But that is not what was being argued. The person was arguing that you are losing huge amounts by paying in BTC and losing out on future returns. 


OMG jesus, so how can you agree with him when you literally only pay for things in BTC........... Its literally counter to his entire point. This was purpose of my post is that irrationally believing in BTC doesnt help BTC. BTC suceeds from fundamentals like adoption.....


If I go and take 1000 USD and buy bitcoin and pay my rent how am I "losing bitcoin"

Ok im going to try this one last time before I throw my computer through the wall. Ignore OP personal BTC. You owe 1000 dollars rent. You can buy 1000 dollars of BTC and send it or just pay 1000 dollars. How do you lose out by paying in BTC? Or another way of looking at it, how do you somehow get BTC you can hold with the 1000 dollars you owe in rent.

No spending is the only form of use that matters when talking about a currency. While Forex trading exists it doesnt result it huge fluctuations of currency value.  BTC value is in its future use as a currency. Anyone who actually wants BTC to succeed cant simply be ok with its use as speculative asset. Im almost confused are you trying to say..... is it that BTC as a speculative asset being traded is fine and it doesnt need to be used as a currency? Thats completely valid opinion if you feel that BTC future is as a commodity or speculative asset and not a currency, even if I dont agree.

@_date: 2017-09-18 19:11:00
Look you can spew academic gargin all you want but your fatal flaw is you are arguing a net zero system. This is not a net zero system, someone doesn't lose if someone else wins. You are loosing the 1000 dollars regardless and you are just wrong.


You are changing the goal posts. You are now talking about theoretical model in which what a rational actor would do. You are saying that its irrational to use BTC, in that case BTC will never succeed. But thats not what you were saying, you were saying that OP will lose out on huge amounts of money by paying in BTC and never bothered to deal with the original premise. So ill try one last time, other then the landlord benefiting (again this assumes landlord wouldnt take the USD anyway and buy bitcoin, or opposite wouldnt take the BTC and immediatly make it fiat). What does OP actually lose from paying in BTC vs fiat
Essentially you went from saying OP loses out on possibly millions of dollars to OP has no real benefit from paying in bitcoin. That is worlds apart.

I can list dozens of things with lower market caps then bitcoin with less volatility, the market cap of something isnt really correlated to its volatility..... i mean if that was case bitcoins volatility would be decreasing as it market cap increases.....


Ive seen someone argue this, that doesnt really make sense. Nothing is stopping someone from taking fiat they were going to use and buying bitcoin to make the purchase (one could argue fees make it not worth it but CC etc have fees and people use those). You arent arguing fees, you are arguing that because it will go up in value, thats why people dont use it, but people have to spend money regardless, nothing stopping someone from taking lets say 1000 dollars of disposable income and instead of using it in fiat form converting to bitcoin then using. 


You missed my point or maybe i missed yours. I was referring to your comment that bitcoin isnt being adopted because its not worth enough. I guess you are claiming that bitcoin increasing in value means that its considered more stable to merchants? It being infinsibly divisible doesnt help it meet demand. (Again this was based off your comment that it needs to increase in value to be adopted). Being divisible doesnt help if market cap isnt large enough to meet adoption needs (which is that point i thought you were attempting to make). 


Why not, they cant realize those expected gains on the bitcoin they are using instead of fiat anyway because they are simply converting their fiat to BTC when needed that they wouldnt have converted anyway. 


Not really...... i mean essentially yes but that speculation unlike bitcoin is based on fundamentals like velocity, supply, demand (to be used to purchase things not demand to hodlering), and well the economies of entire countries. 
 &gt; And just because we base our valuation on things that haven't happened yet doesn't mean they wont happen. 
Well ya i mean im a believer in BTC, but true success of bitcoin is its evaluation being based on fundamentals and not speculation of expected fundamentals. I would rather not see these huge gains (and losses), and see steady corresponding increases that are related to increases in adoption rate, number of transactions, velocity etc.    
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:26:56
Please refer to my edited post. You have fundamentally completely changed the goal posts and point of the conversation. No one was talking about what OP would do given an "economic model" it was weather or not he should. And you said he would "be completely fucked over by paying in bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:39:35
Come on now we are almost there. That EV is not for him its for the 1000 dollars that he will not get to keep.  There is no scenario where he will get to see that EV. Hes not losing anything..... there is no scenario where he gets to realize that EV so the EV is pointless. And in the scenario its not like landlord cant get BTC and OP is doing him favor. The only thing he is losing is the time taken to convert, which is clearly not the premise of your point if your talking about EV
At its core, the loss is solely irrational because its a loss of an EV that you couldnt have anyway
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:12:25
Please explain your logic in the scenario I gave. OP has 1000 dollars, imagine he has no BTC. He can either pay cash or buy BTC to pay rent. How is one better then the other?

Oh god lol. Coinbase sign up of people buying to trade bitcoin is not adoption. People signing up for coinbase to get bitcoim to purchase things is adoption. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:48:47
Also avoid fees when buying. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:44:19
But you have a bit of an oxymoron, BTC will increase in value to levels you are talking about based on adoption, but if its value is maintained mainly by speculation then that cant happen. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:24:49
you edited your post so I changed mind to address it.

What planet are you on that you think Berkshire Hathaway is doing 5%...... I love my crypto gains but my IRA and 401k are on fire as well
Berkshire stock went up 30% last year
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:03:50
I dont know why im bothering or why its upsetting me this much but fact that this is even a controversial post is blowing my mind. I made a post on subreddit talking about that this mentality is whats wrong with the subreddit, and mod marked it as whinning and someone jumped in saying his logic made sense. And people wonder why people think bitcoin is a scam and its just a speculative bubble because of the huge amount of people like this literally acting exactly as such
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:53:10
No because literally nothing has a spot price where everything could be sold at once..... If everyone tried to sell their gold at once price would plummet as well. However I think believing bitcoin will out value the entire US economy is a little much. I mean I guess it's possible with inflation. But a million dollars in my lifetime (same age) will be like 100000 if inflation continues at same rate is has past  60 years 
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:37:14


This is simply not accurate. The thing holding back bitcoin isnt that it isnt "worth enough".  Adoption isnt being held back because bitcoins need to be worth more. If this was the case we would be having issue in not having enough bitcoins in circulation to met usage needs. While yes you are correct for it to reach the level of adoption to warrant kind evaluations people hope for, it still needs to increase in adoption. When majority of coins are being held and not used then its not acting like a currency or treated as such. People need to use their bitcoins along with HODLRing. 


No rapid swings are indicative of the number of people buying and holding bitcoin and buying  on dips and how it susceptible it is to FUD. Adoption will minimize these swings not the speculative increase in the value of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:38:56
What blows my mind from this guy's rambling point he's trying to make is that it's completely counter to why Bitcoin might go up in value over time. If it's a "sucker move" to use it as a currency then why would it go up in value as a currency..........
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:48:25
look at my last point, I think it will finally make you understand my point. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 17:47:31
What....... you are not a very intelligent person are you?
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:32:19


Ya i guess we are still talking in circles because other then an illogical emotional response to knowing bitcoin u spent will go up in value, there is no way to realize that EV therefore it is irrelevant. So to a rational consumer it should make 0 difference.
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:17:33
God his rambling is blowing my mind. At this point I think hes trolling cause no one can be this dense
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:04:31
What are you talking about. At any given time the guy can buy BTC at market rate. Are you seriously this dense. He is reentering the market at the exact moment he pays his rent, if he uses the USD he has for rent to buy the BTC....... You are acting like he cant just buy the BTC with the USD he has for rent....
Again with your logic no one should use BTC as a currency, because its more valuable to hold. Essentially proving point that BTC is a speculative asset bubble and not a currency.  Your logic is literally the strongest argument for BTC not going up in value. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:56:31
Volatility is what drew you to an investment veichle that's.... Interesting.....
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:37:49
I can't with this jeez..... I didn't get burnt at all. I dumped everything a week ago and bought back in last night. Point is I want adoption and usage which isnt going to happen with thos volatility and risks from lack of regulation. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:33:04
Well no, adoption isnt based on price. If it was when price doubles, adoption would correlate. Its actually the opposite, stability is what encourages merchants to is it. Literally all the criticism of BTC in financial sector is that its value is based on speculation and not actual value. We want BTC to have value beyond speculation, otherwise it will never succeed 
Biggest problem with BTC right now is majority of BTC is being held and not used because of speculation. Thats not how a currency should be treated. Thats how a speculative asset is treated.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:09:57
Of course it's a dip, losing 30 percent value in 24 hours is totally normal
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:09:37
Again.... you choose to ignore any points I make.
One more time Paper 1 is looking and 2010-2015... you are ignorning past 2 years of data.
Same with final link. Its just Jan 2015 to Jun 2015 These are literally the lowest point in bitcoin volatility in its history of course these papers would argue its going down cause ignoring the entire 2 years where its higher then 2015.....


Actually I would disagree, while looking at it further there are plenty of points in bitcoin with lower volatility....


Five years ago it was at peak volitility, there are many time periods since then that volitility was lower then it is now, which is counter to your market cap comparison 
You can sling insults all you want, but you pretty much ignore any point I make. Address the points I make instead of using non sequitors. Also none of these correlate to market cap. Look at the two graphs and show me a time period u want to look at that confirms your belief market cap correlates to volatility......
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:35:11
Ya that's what I was saying I mean whole point of bitcoin is to use as a currency...
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:03:10

Why should she be fired? I mean who is more likely to be right, a financial journalist working for one of the largest news companies in the world with access to who knows how many sources in the know, or random redditers on who probably have a very strong bias. There is literally nothing backing up the comment that this is "made up"
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:50:43
Crypto is no different then any high risk investment. I wouldnt say its quite gambling, but like any high risk investment it should make up a very small cross section of your total investments. If anyone is investing in crypto instead of maxing out their IRA or matching their companies 401k contributions they are stupid.....
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:36:28
I did.... a large majority of them just  went to other newsstalkers articles...
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:46:34
Ya... Nothing he said made any sense 
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:30:40
Thats not what you said..... your whole rambling was that you are fucking yourself over and potentially losing millions dont try to back track
Wouldnt be calling you an idiot if you said "Doesnt make a difference either way so why help landlord"
And also how do you not realize adoption is what will increase value of bitcoin not speculation. You are everything wrong with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:38:05
To play devils advocate this isnt necessarily a good thing. (Also that dip was not solely due to CEO's comments). Large swings are not a good thing, what would be better is on these dips if the upswing was slow and stable as a result of underlying factors like increase adoption, good news etc. These large swings show how much wild speculation is still part of the equation. For BTC to hit the numbers many hope it will it needs to be slow and steady and non volatile growth
Lets remember its still nearly 20% below its peak. I look forward to day where these crazy swings dont happen thats when BTC has truly succeeded. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:51:32
I just provided a bunch of examples and graphs, your response is "no do research you dont know what your talking about". Who looks like a fool? Damn w.e waste of my time this isnt a discussion.
Guessing at what, volatility isnt some psedo science, its a calculation thats pretty straight forward. Doesnt require research papers or redditors opinions its a simple calculation......
@_date: 2017-09-18 17:44:09
dude... you are still making no sense. 


What difference does it make to you? 


Please for love of god take a step back from your circle jerk for bitcoin and explain to me the difference between these two scenarios.... Both scenario's OP has 1000 dollars in BTC in his wallet. How does one senario 


1.) OP sends 1000 dollars worth of BTC to landlord. He then buys 1000 dollars in BTC with USD he normally pays landlord with.
2.) OP pays landlord 1000 USD and keeps the 1000 dollars in BTC he has in his wallet. 
You are essentially in a paradox of nonsensical stupidity. Why do you think BTC will go up in value if it hurts you to use it as a currency?
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:44:45
Please for love of god please explain his point. I tried to get him to explain and it was just more nonsense, thats why I was fustrated. I didnt meant this to insult the subreddit it def came off like that, but for BTC discussion to be productive cant entertain illogical rational about it
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:14:47
Jesus christ you dont get it. You owe the rent either way, you dont have to use personal BTC to pay it. You can go and buy the BTC with the USD you dumbass. My god. You are just rambling and completely missing the simple point. Its like you think if he doesnt use BTC he doesnt owe rent or something
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:43:06
Get ready for the downvotes to hell...... even though you are right. You can support BTC and believe in its future and disagree with the HODL meme 
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:36:35
Well w.e I added was based on you going into more detail and first it seemed you were describing not paying in fiat as rational not other way arround
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:23:45
Berkshire Hathaway first and foremost is a investment company. Pretty much Buffets entire networth is in the company and their investments are clearly what he would invest in if he's doing any investments on his own not through their fund wouldn't really make sense...... People invest in his company cause he advertises what he's investing in so they know his performance record .....
You are pretty much insinuating that he some how invest in random stuff outside of Berkshire and these are performing far less then their own portfolio.... While it's probably not 30 percent in the market to think it's 5% in this market
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:23:02
But your whole rambling is about how he shouldnt use it as a currency.............

Look. I love my crypto, but only someone in denial is going compare stock market, based on companies that make things and generate revenue to crypto in its current state.

@_date: 2017-09-19 16:28:39


No you havent..... As you have completely ignored the two graphs...... which is pretty clear cut in terms of market cap vs volatility. But linking me to a blog from 2014 with no sources thats equivalent of a opinion oped really shows i just wasted my time. Im out

It's not about timing markets to a t. These dips when they start going go hard. I'm not a season investor by any stretch, but I'd rather risk a small loss then just hold through a huge dip. Worst case scenario as it starts to rebound I buy a little higher. Was kicking myself but also sold eth at 1250 (went up to 1400 was kicking myself) but wasn't holding when it crashed to 850, bought in at 1000 on way down obviously didn't time it to a t but overall just holding when dips like this dip hard just doesn't make sense

my thoughts is all comes back to his tax situation. The ATO doesnt have crypto experts as investigators, so in reality every day, every news article every time his pictures is plastered on the news is more evidence for his defenese to create reasonable doubt that he is lieing
