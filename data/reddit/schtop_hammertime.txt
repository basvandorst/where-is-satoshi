Sounds interesting.
Did you guys look at bitfossil? There are html pages in different blockchains.
Two of the webpages don't load from 17th October.
Do you have any files that can be shown to have come from a Wikileaks wallet recently? 
(Can you show a link between any file in there and a Wikileaks wallet, or have you opened any type of file and shown it relates to Wikileaks?)

I think you'll find until you have a clear way of proving Wikileaks released any kind of file you'll struggle to get more support (if you can verifiably show a file came from one of their wallets or if you can open a file and show its from Wikileaks).
If you won't heed my advice, then don't complain if not many come to help.

if bitfossil put their own logo into blockchain, it's not a hint - it's what their software is supposed to do.
Once you can show that Wikileaks have been recently encoding files (prove a link between a Wikileaks wallet and a file, in a verifiable way) or that you can find files that are verifiably from Wikileaks (from unknown addresses) then it will be worth posting.
Cable gate is a bit old. Do you have something more recent.
More people might join in when you have started to connect some dots.
Having said that, back to bitfossil - if October 17th is an important date, do you think it's interesting that the links I sent won't open (you can see the Bitcoin addresses used in the Bitfossil urls).
I wonder if you know any Bitcoin addresses WL use, and whether they show up in any of the the bit fossil addresses / transactions
