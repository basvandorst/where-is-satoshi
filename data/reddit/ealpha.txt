A year without any kitchen appliances? I believe what I did was the right thing to do, once I can, I'll hopefully be able to buy a little again. Happy Holidays!

I did give my mom a very little amount of Bitcoin earlier this year to teach her, she actually just told me she's looking to use the small amount of money she was saving for a new microwave to buy some Bitcoin!

I'm looking into what would be the best option for her, but thank you for your concern!

Yeah, I've had the dream of owning 1btc for quite some time, but I also know she has dreamt of a new kitchen. So I put her  needs before mine, like she has done so many times for me!

Well atleast I held on through this last dip. I'm not in it for short term.
