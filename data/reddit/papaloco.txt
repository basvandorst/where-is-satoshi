Spoon feeding. For asking you to back up your claim regarding tax havens being awesome? Allrighty then. Good talk.
*edit replied to the wrong comment.  I apologize.

Allright, I'm out of my depth here. I had to look those acronyms up. Could you tell me, in your opinions, what they should be doing instead and how this relates to tax havens being beneficial?

Thank you, interesting. 
I would think tax havens were for the rich, most people don't earn enough to make it a viable option.

Where are there keynesian central banks?

What reality do you live in? One where trickle down economy works? I strongly disagree that keynesian economy has been shown not to work. Your ideas that tax havens are important to conserve capital is also ridiculous. 
Please, tell me how a billionaire is positively affected in any way by skirting tax laws? When you effectively have more money than you could ever use why not pay taxes?

You are smoking something good if call the European economy keynesian. Merkel has been forcing cutbacks after cutbacks with horrible results. A keynesian approach would have been way better in my opinion. 
The fact that the central banks print money, is that a keynesian thing? Honestly curious. When the money printed are for bailing out failing banks I don't think it qualifies as keynesian. But please set me straight.
