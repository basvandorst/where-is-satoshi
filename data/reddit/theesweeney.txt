A slightly annoying workaround is to buy the desired dollar amount in ETH, transfer it to gdax, sell the ETH on gdax, and then use the funds to buy BTC/LTC on gdax.
I did that to buy some LTC and BTC this morning, and for the three transactions on gdax (ETH-&gt;USD, USD-&gt;BTC, USD-&gt;LTC) the combined fees were around 50 cents (not including fees on initial ETH buy on coinbase)

I've got it at up 2.4% in the last 24 hours on GDAX as of this post. Not back to the peak, but still up day-to-day.

My theory is a lot of people got excited as this seemed to signal strength in the btc community. But they were eventually outweighed by people moving back to alts from BTC. Just my two satoshi.

That's a fair criticism, and they even address it in the forward by saying that yes he does repeat some analogies, but typically in different contexts and to explain slightly different concepts. At the end of the day, it's still a fantastic listen. I've gone over it at least three times as an audiobook and have definitely used some of his examples to help me explain concepts to people. Enjoy!

Andreas Antonopolous, who is also the author of Internet of Money, which is a solid collection of bits and pieces from various talks he's done on bitcoin over the past few years. It is non-technical and full of fantastic analogies for describing btc to new users. Definitely audiobook-able.

While I think eventually this will help increase the BTC price, I feel like a decent part of the trading volume that pushed the price up over the past few weeks was people dumping alts for btc to try and get some "free" coin. As such, I think we're about to see a drop in BTC as these investors flood back to their alts.
Macro level I think BTC will still hit 10k by year end, but I definitely think today is going to be a decent dip. I sold at 7650, as I type this it's around 7480, let's see what happens.

Honestly I have no idea, wish I could help.
