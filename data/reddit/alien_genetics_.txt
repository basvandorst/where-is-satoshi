My second mentor once told me knowledge is found in my garage

I just found it very interesting. Took a screen shot and blocked me. Being all over the internet for marketing, it was a valid debate. I feel like its a lack of integrity on his part. He opened my eyes at least to reading, kind of made me realize the incredible diversity in learning.

Yes, it was nothing rude, vulgar, anything like that. If there isnt something that lacks integrity why would he block me? Hoping I don't screenshot or record a response?

I will say he give me the business idea that I went into on a limb  when I was 6ft under. It's quite suprising that he took a screenshot and blocked me. I know he is getting a ton of shit about his crypto "program" even people who made a investment they could afford to lose, some people don't take time to learn for themselves and follow him like a heard of sheep. I don't listen to his podcasts, I do read the titles and have noticed a trend on what the crypto "mastermind" podcasts are about. It might be laughable or almost ironic on my part that I have taken a little bit of time to follow him. He would also blow me up that I went on reddit and made a post. Probably would be the pinnacle of him roasting me if he saw this. I have found him predictable. He is obssessed with psycology and uses every aspect of various perusuasion to the point it is almost manipulative in a very unhealthy, essentially crooked way.

I bought Zcoin and was a victim of a pump and dump, It was trading at $69 and someone bought my coin at $96.

This is the best advice you may ever here. Take out your principle when you make some profits. The future looks good, yet it's still a gamble that looks favorable. You just never know. Think about it.
