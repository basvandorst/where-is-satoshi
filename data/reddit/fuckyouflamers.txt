Oh okay. Thanks for the info. I just wanted to make sure this is normal and that I didn't just throw away money. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:10:51
I didn't realize there were fees. :/ It said it was free.

About you!

Ha, lol, i remember these things. They are pretty ironic...

That makes sense but like I said it's showing me an order of 0.99, minus the fee of .01, for a credit of 0.98. I don't mind the fee it's the $1 bought at 9934 translating to 0.99 at 9950 that has me confused.

Thanks that makes a lot more sense!

Do you know anything about Gemini's fees? It says 0.99 - .01 fee for 0.98 back. Also thanks!

Thank you!

Why can't I sell back for the same price that I bought then? Why have I lost an entire penny? Also same thing happened on GDAX with a $48. I couldn't get it past $47 until after it had climbed more than $15.

Coincidence? Methinks not

No doubt about it. I wonder though, if they "ban" bitcoin would the secretive sides of the rich continue buying as the price "drops", through shady avenues, and then have an even stronger position than they could have had without the ban. You never know..

We'll see what avenues are being used by "criminals" if it ever gets banned, but I am sure they could launder their money and buy them in countries where it is legal. I've heard jokes of them buying "art" that would allow them to get crypto, maybe things similar to the silkroad with drugs.

If bitcoin gets banned your bank account \+ Coinbase will make a trail that will be too incriminating, if its not blocked. The difficulty of laundering or the other possible options might be worth the potential billions that could be made during the ban, sorta like the alcohol bootleggers back in the day.
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:06:12
Yeah, there will be some issues, but I think Bitcoin will keep going, the cat's out the bag at this point. I am betting USA won't ban it anyways
