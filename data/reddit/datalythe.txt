[Fees are steadily reducing as the mempool clears up]( but after this weekend's nonsense, and depending on rate of new transactions, we're likely looking at at least 24hrs before we regain any sort of normalcy.

The problem is, in general, that if you keep your coins on Coinbase, you don't own them - you own coinbase IOUs. If anything should happen to Coinbase servers, your coins may be gone: they have your private keys, and if their network is compromised, so are your coins. 
Look into, at the very least, desktop wallets: I recommend [Electrum](

It's accurate to the extent that whoever wrote it has a crystal ball.
So no, not accurate.

Coinbase *does* have a wallet - an *online* wallet, which is where your coins are now. 
The problem with online wallets is that if the website/service you're using takes a dive/gets hacked/has its security compromised, your private keys (which essentially control your account) are there to be lost/for the taking. 
[Here's a simple guide]( but you'd do well to do your own research :)
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:40:48
You can pay by card on Coinify, there's a fee (%3 I think) and a daily limit (~£200 I think), but it's instant and easy.

The fork occurs @ block 491407, which is estimated to be (at time of this comment) 3 days and 22 hours away.

[The BTG team have indicated in a press release that this Coinbase article is completely false]( and you can check their source code on Github if you don't believe it.
The fork is to occur @ Block 491,407, and we are currently @ 491,292.

@_date: 2017-10-22 19:52:18


That is nonsense from Coinbase, and the BTG team has called them out on it. The fork occurs at block 491,407 - we are currently @ 491,199.

Yes, with an Electrum wallet, you control your own keys, and so will be able to set-up a BTG wallet after the fork to claim your air-drop. 
Just await instructions for a time after the fork :)
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:39:16
Yes - that's essentially it.
The password you've mentioned is how you access your Electrum wallet, and you can change it at any time. Entering that password just opens up your wallet for you to send or check the receipt of funds. As you said, you don't even need to remember that password really, so long as you have your seed phrase - as you've already seen, you can re-access your wallet at any time using that phrase.
Re: your private keys - they are associated with your unique wallet (and seed phrase). You haven't seen them because Electrum purposefully hides them in the menu, to keep it away from prying eyes, unnecessary copying, etc. You can click on Wallet&gt;Private Keys&gt;Export to copy them to a separate, out-of-wallet file. 
You will need these keys to  be able to access air-drops after hard-forks (like BCH and the upcoming BTG), but explaining that is for another time! :)
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:21:29
You can post questions on for future reference.
Re: your question, BTG has not launched yet, which means that the infrastructure is not up and running, which means that there are currently no wallets in operation to retrieve your air-dropped BTG. Keep an eye on the forums/blogs/etc. and you'll stay updated on instructions.

@_date: 2017-10-28 11:13:15
I'm sure you've heard this before, but you really ought consider -
 for safety's sake - removing your coins from an online exchange wallet (e.g. Coinbase) and moving them to at the very least a desktop-client wallet (e.g. Electrum) where you control your private key.
See [here]( for more details.
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:29:15
Very interesting. Though with a little digging, it seems that [this company - named 'Bitcoin Mining and Trading']( has just changed its name - address, ownership, etc. all match.
Can a business just use the name Tesco though? If not, perhaps Tesco has bought them? Couldn't find any more information, but worth looking in to!
