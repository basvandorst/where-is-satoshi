Feels expensive because I haven't bought back in yet, but I guess you're right.

I don't mind external attacks so much, but this one's different - it's from within the Bitcoin community itself. If we allow their dirty tactics and impatience to influence those holding BTC, they might actually "win".

Perhaps I should've rephrased it as "Investing in cryptocurrency", because while Bitcoin isn't *definitely* the future, digital currency just has to be.

You must be a very rich person if you know exactly when to sell and buy back in.

Ah I see, thank you.
In my mind I'm thinking about a situation where everyone realises bitcoin is better than any fiat, and all scramble to switch over, effectively nullifying fiat - what happens to everyone who's left with fiat? Perhaps it's a pointless hypothetical but I still find it interesting. Yeah, there might be some rich folk who just have to cut their losses, but there also might be some poor families who didn't get in on time and now they have wheel barrows of fiat worth nothing - and bitcoin has caused a potential humanitarian crisis, in a sense, while trying to prevent them!

When we aren't under attack from an alt-coin that benefits from FUD.

If BTC continues being a "store of value" and incompatible with small purchases due to high fees, I expect LTC will have significant utility. The BTC community might even encourage a partnership between the two, especially with atomic swaps. In that scenario, I imagine the price of LTC will skyrocket, meaning we have an opportunity that we missed with BTC. 
However, if BTC adapts and becomes both a store of value and a small purchase currency, I really don't see the use for LTC. Hence my current hesitation. 
Which alts are you invested in? 
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:03:20
No, I own 1 LTC though. I have been tempted to get more involved in LTC after the Lightning Network progress, but I'm uncertain about its future. You?
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:28:00
Sure, but I trust the devs to take the necessary time to ensure they don't fuck with billions of dollars stored in BTC. Rushing a fix during a BCH pump and dump doesn't sound like a good idea, and we'd just be lowering to the impatience that caused the hard fork in the first place.
This is a clash between the patient and the impatient in my non-expert opinion.

You should use his actual face from the video, because it kind of looks pro-Bcash at the moment.

Depends if BTC negates the benefits of LTC or not. I like the silver/gold, small purchase/big purchase comparison - but if BTC becomes both, surely LTC will zero?

What about the hypothetical scenario where Bitcoin becomes the sole global currency - there might not be anything worth exchanging into? You can say this won't happen, and you'd probably be right, but I'm interested in the possible outcomes of universal adoption. 


Will transaction fees have to go up to incentivize those who currently earn bitcoin from it?
