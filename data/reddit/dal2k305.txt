There's always that one guy. All that's missing is a few illuminati statements and something about chemtrails. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:13:50
Lmao it's funny though based off that line it's gonna go back down to 5000....

A solar panel on every house, solar farms in Arizona. It can be done you just lack the vision to see it 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:56:33
The exact opposite will happen. If the economy starts going bad people will pull their money out of BTC to buy food so they don't starve.
The value of something is dependent on how badly you need it.

You dumb

At any point a buyer or seller can cancel their limit order.... 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:22:01
Market cap is (price)(total number of BTC)
If every seller decided to list at 33,000 there would be a group of people who would list much lower and all the buyers will buy from them instead of everyone else.  That's how supply and demand works. 
If you can't sell something it is essentially worth nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:09:13
Well there's a huge amount of sell resistance at 12,000 so you better get that razor ready 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:48:01
Call chase and tell them to unblock your account. Tell them you made that purchase and it will work.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:24:49
Why can't we mine bitcoin using solar energy ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:41:30
This doesn't mean anything. Btc can drop 30% 6 times and on the 7th time it drops 60% and stays there for 2 years. 
Right now the retail investors that were holding this thing together are exhausted. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:05:08
They tell you on the receipt how long it will take for your funds to be available. ITS YOUR FAULT FOR NOT READING.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:00:21
If you're are dead set on doing this only sell a small percentage of your total holdings. Maybe 20%. Other than that hodl 
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:54:21
Yea that’s because with the NASDAQ the traders are making the profit NOT the exchange. 
@_date: 2019-11-22 15:10:48
The large mining operations are constantly dumping huge amounts of BTC into the market to pay their bills, specifically electricity. A lot of people don’t realize just how much electricity it costs to mine BTC. This sell pressure is constant.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:24:50
That’s not how currency functions... more money is printed because there is more people in the world, more business, more transactions etc. I agree that the fed at times gets out of control but inflation is necessary for capitalism to function. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:34:52
Early internet pioneers didn’t go around bragging about there new world communication system. They quietly worked, worked hard on a useful product. 
Stop posting such shit and go do something to make bitcoin useful.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:20:48
You are so idealist!
During all those millennia the life expectancy of the average person was 35-40 years old. People would die of small wounds because of infection. People would die in mass of the flu. 
The drive to acquire money pushes people to work harder and funds medical universities that developed medicine and technology to let people live longer.

LMAO FAKE BREAD LINES!!!!
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:55:10
Dude 1929-1931 was the worst time in modern economic history.... 
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:44:34
Nature? In nature animals consume each other. There is no protection from predators. Extreme cold will kill you. People would die of starvation when the weather was bad for a few years. Hundreds of different micro-organisms each clawing for a chance to infect your body. Parasites infesting people’s intestinal system.
Our system is not perfect but it’s damn better than it used to be. Nature is not this perfect happy thing. Luckily for you, you live in modern times and don’t have to deal with any of that crap.

Great Depression??
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:48:16
It was caused by over leveraged banks, bank runs, weak fed policy, the gold standard, inefficiencies in the system, dependence on manufacturing, reduction in consumer spending, reduced investment.
Deflation causes people to not spend their money because why spend something thats gaining value. What you don’t realize is that when you don’t spend money, business doesn’t make money, workers don’t get paid and a deflationary death spiral begins.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:15:19
Yes because without a smartphone/computer you can't buy BTC. Valuation is dependent on how much you need something now. If you're starving you will sell your BTC for food. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:05:22
Your chart is misleading because June 2014 is same year as the crash while we are 2 years out. The appropriate arrow would have been on June 2015.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:21:28
Dumbass kid
Not everything the government does is bad. You are ascribing to an absolute Fox News talking point and it's making you look so stupid. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:10:40
Honestly dude no. $100 is of no real value. If you want you could report the loss to the IRS but if you don't they're not gonna notice.
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:49:47
21 million btc will be reached after 2100. What do you think the market cap of large corporations will be far into the future ?
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:08:30
He didn't lose $600. If he only bought $100 worth of bitcoin he would multiply the percentage that he lost by the original value to determine how much he actually lost.

Amazon sells a lot of electronics and other things. Prime isn't their only source of income. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 20:11:01
You're only focusing on the end of 2017... bitcoin has been around for years. What drove the price up in 2013?
You are right that FOMO drove the price up irrationally during dec 2017 but things change, people quickly forget, markets change and the cycle continues.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:13:52
That's not how trading markets, GDAX, works.
Buy and sell orders get clumped together. A buy wall of 100 BTC is not one person but instead multiple people trying to buy at that price.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:18:04
Dude seriously come back to earth.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:20:34
Not everything is a conspiracy. Bitcoin is going down because it went up too fast. The jump from 9000-19000 was unreal. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:24:47
Come back to earth please...
Without these new people bitcoin is going NOWHERE. Metcafe law, adoption etc
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:51:07
Oooo there gonna take your guns, jobs and now your bank account. So scary!
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:59:49
Dude what r u the Reddit police?
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:58:54
What if I told you BTC is going down because not enough people are buying. Not everything is a conspiracy
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:07:52
When you sign up with a credit card you are signing up with a private company to use their credit service. You are using their money not yours. This is more of a business decision. They are afraid that people will default on the credit.
You shouldn't be buying crypto on credit.

What makes coinbase garbage ?
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:47:45
You’re talking about the people who thought the earth was flat and didn’t understand how weather functioned?
What separates the Bible from Native American folklore tales? Both just as old but Christians will quickly dismiss the Native American stories but believe that Jonah got swallowed by a large fish.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:23:21
Should I also follow the wisdom of ancient European medical texts? Bloodletting definitely helps cure disease.... 
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:20:49
You guys are kidding right? A few days ago the DNC filed a lawsuit against WikiLeaks, Russia, and the trump campaign for the collusion. 
Coinbase is proactively distancing themselves from an entity that is seen as a threat to US national security.
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:20:20
Why do you assume I never read the Bible? 
I was raised Christian, went to church every Sunday, VBS, church trips etc. I’ve read all the gospels.
I reject it because people 2000 years ago have no fucking idea what they were talking about. It is idiotic to put your faith in something so old.
