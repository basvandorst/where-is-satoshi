@_date: 2018-01-17 13:24:01
The opposite of investing is day trading. If you try to day trade, you will get burned. this is why as a long term strategy HODLing simply works, and people like you come in during dip seasons skeptically after we've already made money. But you just go on and keep panic selling and trying to time the market there.

"Really? What fiat currency had a 1200% loss of value last year?"
Dude. Are you mathematically illiterate? Bitcoin rose 1200%, but has a smaller market cap. You don't need a -1200% on currency to derive a 1200% growth rate of Bitcoin because Bitcoin and fiat aren't starting at on the same footing with the same market cap. They're on entirely different levels right now.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:53:17
Bitcoin is an actual accepted currency in Japan and Dubai, and for a lot of purposes. There's also a roadmap that's gradually being implemented to deal with these issues. Money has related issues. Besides that, Bitcoin is decentralized and does not have a CEO (now whether you believe that  or  not is up to you) . It's sort of the entire point; so if Bcash becomes a thing, it's very obviously/directed run by somebody. There's going to be definite political/personal incentives that take precedence over users deciding over it's future. 
Lastly, the definition of money is perceived value. And scarcity helps. Bitcoin is already the dominant player. It might not be "the" coin, but with LN and Segwit gradually being adopted, and with massive use, it's going to be around for a long while. 
Personally, I see Bitcoin as a store of value more than a transactional currency though. So pragmatically, I don't see it  depreciating, and as a way to diversify my holdings from Fiat (because anything e.g. war could cause the dollar to plummet), I will continue to HODL and invest more of my overall wealth into Bitcoin as it dips until it reaches about 33% of it all.

lol so you are saying it's impossible to be a certain group and support or vote for Trump. Thats potentially racist/sexist/ageist/whatever. Also that doesn't for me personally since since my two best friends who are supporters are gay (and I'm minority), and a good half of our other gay friends support Trump. And there are a lot of members of minorities (although legal American minorities) who I know support Trump over any typical politician and are happy with how things are going. The reason we don't come out is because people like to be racist towards non Democrat minorities and start throwing words out like "Uncle Tom", or imply that all Latinos should hate him because it's all the same as illegal. But nobody owns us as individuals, and some of us are proud to live here and come here legally.
In any case, 2020 will be fun.

Miners do not only have a giant super computer consuming 1,000,000kwH. They also have distributed mining. It's not expensive to throw a distributed processing node in an already-used web app. Think about it like a distributed microservice system in the cloud, except inverted to run on app user PCs. This is especially common using WebGL.

Also forgot to address this: assuming quantum computers can just crack HTTPS passwords is scientifically stupid. Using a quantum computer doesn't allow it to interact with everything using entanglement; it would only allow certain internal calculations to be performed faster -- assuming you could hit the end data you needed with the frequency and freedom. HTTPS also requires a unique hash and a verification  step. Its not "one password to rule them all'. Even if there was, you cannot just go to a network and run a quantum computer and assume all nodes are a qubit and do whatever you want  by essentially ignoring a pre-existing system's existence. This is why they're more applicable to solving problems like artificial intelligence and creating new security solutions.

We can worry about that after a quantum computer is verified as a real thing. Right now we do not have one in the same sense that we have a processor; it's subject to a lot of external things, and takes up an entire room and requires a temperature of like -1000 degrees to run in (in addition to costing a billion dollars).   Quantum computers are limited to what they can do anyway. We can't use them like PCs. They only work with quantum mechanics in a hacky way. They also can't be used normally. Got a good 100 years before you can even begin to imagine them used as a regular thing. They're more analogous to flying cars since we haven't had enough fundamental advancement in real physical/energy tech.

What's with the increasing number of BCH shills and tipper bots recently? can we ban those?
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:51:28
Yes, as a product. The whole point of BTC was nobody owns or controls  it. BCH also doesn't *actually* solves the scalability issue as a currency, it just makes the inevitable take longer. Besides that it doesn't have as good of a plan going forward, and it has to resort to stupid tactics like tipper bots. Those are being distributed from a fund, which is trying to advertise it's approach like Pineapple Fund but actually just being a tool for shilling on competing coins that it copied like BTC.

Also you don't get anything back renting, vs the little bit you keep in equity (although for real people it usually only counts for like 25% of what they're paying in total with taxes and maintainance/etc). It really depends on the individual. For me time and opportunity is much more valuable than saving a few dollars on rent vs mortgage. As a young ballin' opportunist,  a mortgage would prevent me from getting a continuous 20-30% pay raise every year or two by moving to the best opportunity for both my career, personal interest and income.

What are you implying with that? That they need to be white and male?
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:02:23
We're talking about a credit card. They are allowed to do a background check and give you a spending limit when you get the card -- that's what its for. Investing in Bitcoin is the same as investing in a stock and has the same capital gains/losses. What is it that allows them to say that you can't spend your money at a legal store if it has a VISA or MasterCard logo? They also don't only provide a service of credit but legally they owe me more money than is on my revolving credit e.g. my savings/checking. You also cannot process an ACH/wire transfer in less than 1-2 weeks for most things (in case you haven't noticed), so many people use credit/debit cards for other purposes than "borrowing money".
So again, it's not so black and white -- to keep repeating "lending money for gambling" is dumb and that's exactly why there exists such things as credit scores/limits/etc.
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:44:15
-1000 degrees was just a joke to mean "cold enough not to move any particles". But if you want specific: you do need -457 degrees, which is 2 degrees ish above lowest physically possible. 
So what's the difference?
I am not hating on quantum computers but you seem to be assuming they can do a lot more than they do or are in reality. The difference between the development of traditional computers and quantum computers is traditional computers have had their physics understood and malleable for quite some time before they exploded; they're essentially just CMOS. Quantum computers are literally interdimensional and we are not working with the physics but hacking them. We are resorting to a theory of statistics to make predictions which is fundamentally different from physical properties of electricity. They also exist in a vacuum; they don't make pre existing computers suddenly quantum (which are some presumptions that need to be made to claim some things you're claiming).
If you look at the history of a traditional computer, Ada Lovelace wrote a paper outlining exactly how that type of machine could work logically. That has been extremely consistent until today. The closest thing we have to Quantum Computing in history is: Alice in Wonderland?

You completely implied that they did, otherwise your point was kind of pointless. Credit and money is federally regulated. You don't get to tell people how to spend their money.

@_date: 2018-01-16 04:13:49
oh man. Are you new to Bitcoin? you ask tough questions that I've seen many times everywhere on the internet. 
But yeah it's possible for other coins, in some alternate reality. And that's what they have sub reddits. I think the arguments and merits as well as actual use cases + speculation provide enough reason for me to believe in it. I don't know some crazy secret; I just look at the trends. I also think about the concepts, look at the code and who/what are investing in it as well as it's use case so far. None of this is secret or hard to Google. Bitcoin is decentralized but also it's commits/decisions for updates are run by a form of meritocracy into the source code. That's fundamentally different from almost every other altcoin. Also, most ICO and alts have source code that looks like it was written by a noob in his off hours. Or they're domineered by insiders and have questionable corporate relationships that are antithetical to Bitcoin's philosophy of decentralization (e.g. Bitcoin Cash).
But I also have to ask: why see you suddenly here? to shill for BCash/alts and downvote? If you don't know the difference between Etherium and Bitcoin, it might not be a wise idea to invest until you learn about all of your options.

The point also was we have full control over PCs. It's not impossible to conceive of a Turing machine that we can fully control. We do not have *control* of quantum computer processing, we use a statistical analysis to generate results. Also that the physics themselves are not pragmatic because they literally are on the edge case of known reality.
Anyway if you don't work in STEM, there's nothing wrong with that. But at least try to have an understanding of what you're talking about if you will talk about computers and tech. Saying "you never know cause tech!" over and over doesn't override having incontrovertible scientific basis/evidence.

If you don't understand Bitcoin, how it works, it's implications or anything else, but you buy anyway and hope to time a sell off, you're only going to waste your time and money on bad timing with "the algos". Otherwise, if you understand where and how it is already used, you have a solid foundation to make decisions.
(Same with literally any investment. YMMV though)

Exactly. What's the point of both buying as well as going into a thread talking about issues that are only issues with lack of due diligence and low investment amounts. If you didn't want high fees/transaction times and want to use it as a speculative tool for fiat, then just use an exchange.

I think you're looking at globalism vs one country's economy. In globalism, the divide between the haves and don't haves increases while pushing the middle class down towards a more equitable distribution of income with other have nots. This is what we have today, but the real purchasing power of the average middle class American has went down over the past few decades (whereas it has increased for South Americans and Chinese laborers).

Gdax only takes about 6 months for verification. For that reason, I've also been going with Coinbase until things gets sorted as these are some of the only reliable sources in NY I've found.
If you're stuck though, it costs a bit less for debit/credit; they seem to charge me only 2.5% with my Chase card (even though it states 4%?) and if over $200, no 1% fee. Otherwise you're at 3.5% (or 5% if I'm at some weird exception here).  I already get back 3% on Amazon card and don't pay interest since I pay in full so it's not a big deal.
Gdax is obviously better with fees, but considering the volatile nature of Bitcoin and potential wins it's better than not participating at all.

Flat Earther? ok buddy. I studied stochastic processes as part of my education (which includes grad degree in STEM) and it's pretty well known that a lot of big players are paying people to work on Bitcoin. 
You're just another random troll who stumbled onto something and can't look objectively at it or risk even considering the flip side of your confirmation bias now that you have mentally invested into Bitcoin.

Not entirely true. If you have the potential to get substantial (&gt; 15%) raise through your profession and want to live a long and healthy life, sometimes it's better to let it go (although you might want to put an alert on things). This is especially if you are using swings to gauge emotional decisions. Just set a rule and stick to it unless there's some extreme news.

You're throwing your money into this. It's worth knowing what goes into it. So you can go on with this burden of proof stuff as if I am selling you something or your last name is Sakamoto. With any investment, a person with aforementioned "common sense" would usually consider both a) the knowns and b) the unknowns about Bitcoin.  This is without all of the hype and mindless religious mindless worship on this subreddit in general. Looking at it without bias makes the difference between feeling based bets and logical investing.

It's not the languages, it's how they're used. You're probably just accustomed to writing a Rust app (judging from your post) and carry on the same habits in C. Otherwise doesn't make much sense at all; most of Linux runs on C and also runs most of the internet. Judging a language on a beta product doesn't make sense either; if it were written in Rust it would have a host of business logic related problems if it were rushed and/or unfinished just as anything else.

Um wuht, did you read even the first sentence of the article? insider trading. It's ridiculously obvious. And how often do you say your team will release a software project publically in 30 days but end up releasing it within 48 hours without explanation? How does that even get explained? There was none technically in this instance either. So can you name one example of a legitimate company which has done that outside of this case? The key here is not only the strange actions of a financial exchange company but the context of those actions.

You can do all of those things with C if you are competent with it. Nobody claimed it was perfect. No language is perfect. There are trade-offs, but security and stability are not issues inherent to C as you are claiming. This is not hard-to-find information either.

@ the downvoters: if you haven't realized that your federal withholding has decreased e.g. paycheck increased, and have  not been able to connect the dots that taxes have been  lowered on normal tax rates for everyone (directly in opposition  to what was initially said), you are retarded and should probably not touch things like Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:49:28
eventually BCH is gonna be worthless with the state of their development/userbase. It'll destroy itself over time.

@_date: 2018-03-03 17:05:44
Not sure where you read or heard about Bitcoin/crypto related exchanges not falling under the jurisdiction of the SEC in the US but that's 100% incorrect. Repeating something false enough times doesn't change the reality. Bitcoin is public on Coinbase and it is an exchange of items considered securities. There was insider pump and dumping before launching BCH, with no transparency as to how/when they would provide a financial instrument that directly affects the price. This involved massive amounts of other people's money, and Coinbase is an American company.


(this statement reiterating their stance was actually made during the first week of August)
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:56:33
that's a fair point, but "better" is subjective. If a language is Turing complete,  it's capabilities are usually almost the  same but written differently -- even if we contrast functional, object oriented, etc. For example in C there are things (such as integration with any decent IDE) which might make your debugging issues trivial. Sometimes a bad experience is also caused by what is not known more than just trying what you know. For yourself, you might see C as a bad language because the tools should fit the people and most likely your mind doesn't naturally orient itself that way and you perceive possible benefits as issues and vice versa. Or you're using a shitty compiler (there are many) or were unaware of certain APIs, patterns or flavor (unfortunately many people don't even use the latest C standard).  I don't use C myself, but I know enough people who are skilled who do to know that my opinion isn't the end-all in regards to my language of choice. Use what makes you productive but don't assume your best workflow automatically makes another thing better.

@_date: 2018-02-15 18:06:21
During the ATH, there were zero nodes using LN on mainnet. Now, there's almost as many lightning nodes live as there are BCash nodes (admitted still a drop in the bucket  for BTC), and they are consistently doubling weekly and haven't even gotten adoption by big exchanges yet.  Transactions are also  proportionally more than 700% cheaper for an equal volume than they were before. lol wtf are you talking about?

BTC isn't set in stone; that's why we have Segwit and LN coming. Just the beginning. Besides, when more people's money is involved (especially compared to something like BCH scamcoins), it is an incentive to maintain/improve the network. Its so far not yet the fastest but is improving and proven reliable. Most of all, people can actually  use it. Besides, theres no impetus to improve a product without customers.

I wasn't born in a bubble. I understand the concept of a bubble. But you are now crying wolf at this point. This happens every year. If you look at the chart for most years around New Year's (and actually zoom in, because of exponential growth). Its especially exacerbated by weak holders and doomsayers who try to make a quick buck and get burned as bag holders.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:41:41
I see evidence every year of this happening though; I mean that's where the signs actually point if we were to consider this realistically. This year there was massive adoption in Asia, to the point where you can do POC sales in Japan at a lot of big retail outlets. The fact that the transaction fee is simultaneously going down and segwit is up as there is still strong use in 1st world countries somewhere is good mana. It's a significant pace of adoption to the point where there's zero chance the user base will be non existent by the time it's removed/revoked of all its current uses. 
Pragmatically for me personally, I have to do my taxes and I don't want to claim a gain or a loss and I have faith in the long term (e.g. 2020) in BTC. So it doesn't make sense to pull out and make things complicated when 1) I can't predict what's going to happen to "time" the eventual upswing, 2) I have good career opportunities currently and can get significant raises on top of a decent living so using energy for day trading makes no sense and 3)  I plan to continue investing for larger long term gains anyway (lastly fuck the federal reserve, and I'm sure many Bitcoiners are in on that sentiment)

lol if you "understand the problem space", you'd get that you leverage WebGL which utilizes graphics cards. Further, on v8, it's not exponentially slower which is the point of algorithms (it is just a multiple). There are also a lot more native optimizations coming into play recently with things such as Buffers. 
Further, the only thing your hardware on the server does in distributed networks has to do is parse and interpret messages between processes (this is on a single PC as well). So you're saying it's better to buy a graphics card than to leverage 500k other people's at 1/4 a normal speed? you still have 125k+ times the efficiency - 50% IF we're being super conservative. I would def want to make 100+k times the money back mining on the same server if there wasn't something wrong with me.
You're being all condescending in this post, but yet sound like you're stuck in the internet a decade ago ffs. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:37:33
except for Bitcash it's still using an O(n) solution which is worse in the future and has downsides for both mining as well as bandwidth in countries that actually need Bitcoin today. Segwit and LN are temporarily useful partially and extremely useful in the long run and they are actively rolling out that tech + innovating, while alt shills have...?... not even most of the core devs that forked off jumped ship with the temporary lower fees. It's a joke and a scam for non techies and pretentious hipsters. This is why the volume is so low and nobody uses Bitcash even though it's running BTC 6 months ago with a changed integer for blocksize (in the real world). If you go to their reddit, they blatantly scammed off BTC ticker and link to a ghetto forum because they're scared that if you look at BTCs repo and commits you'd see that the consensus of active devs agree with BTCs way which is the "Nakamoto consensus".
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:06:26
it's a lot less risky statistically in almost everything to HODL as your mantra -- as long as you diversify appropriately. The alternative is trying to time the market (e.g. everyone and their mom lately with BTC)

I agree (and I think it's stupid when people say ALWAYS HODL because that mathematically makes no sense if you have the facilities to make money faster). It just takes a lot of mental energy to do that that I don't realistically think pays off better.

Mwa. Mwa. Delicioso. I can almost taste the end of shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:04:55
Implication was to figure out if it's worth the losses in taxes when taking it out. Fees would be a calculation to consider if you're not putting in/pulling out thousands at a time (just trying to be helpful).
Also I haven't looked specifics but kind of doubful crypto fees are counted. The IRS/govt currently looks at it as an asset to own rather than as a currency or stock. Also no real regulations as of yet which probably as a corollary means no formal definition on exchanges of crypto (which again not recognized as currency).
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:02:35
That makes it more volatile in weak hands but the price will actually go up overall.... It's how supply and demand works.

I come here to talk about the developing Bitcoin technologies and actually investing; not to shill and get paid with you to work for "the BCrash Fund". Otherwise I'd go to r/bcash (or scammy at r/btc) to be a positive Peter there, and not a negative Nancy here.  
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:45:20
which means they can be even more moonlike
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:24:44
it works the opposite way around. LN will help adoption because it will increase the value of BTC by making transactions more pragmatic. This would also increase the price with speculation but it doesn't need to be win/lose. It isn't only the number of buyers/seller ratio as commonly regurgitated here but perceived value that determines the price at the end of the day.
@_date: 2018-02-26 06:28:05

You don't need such a high IQ to understand block chain tech, dude... you essentially only need to be able to learn the answer to the question: "what is a hash", then how that might work on  a network with time considered.

@_date: 2018-02-02 02:24:08
BCH people are especially irrational about this. Whenever I explain that increasing block size doesn't help people in places like Venezuela with shit bandwidth (or just overall with currency adoption causing cubic growth in general), they get annoyed and say "no durr increase j00r block chain size for fast efficient transfer" -- except it's still running at O(N) which is exponentially horrible compared to LN and Segwit.

Block chain isn't simply about the ledger (at least Bitcoin isn't). Take some time to learn it completely, rather than storming r/Bitcoin after watching a noob YouTube video and think you understand. The ledger is only one part. The other is proof of work, which is why it is valuable as a currency (no centralization for verification). Seems like you just started learning about Bitcoin yesterday.

European Countries are not in the same league as Scandinavian countries economically and are on a major decline (especially in terms of employment and debt). Putting them in the same category for anything other than high tax rate and maybe being a first world country (especially for areas like France and Spain) doesn't make the most sense.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:23:59
yes they do;  is an example among many I see every day (get a virus scanner and notice the prompts).  And if you try to use a CPU, simply due to threading/utilization on a modern processor, it's not efficient (hence why you would utilize the GPU which is not tied up on things like IO). Modern GPUs also have fully functioning ALUs and registers with RAM. Besides that, offloading to thousands of users even at a fraction of efficiency is not comparable to running on your one CPU. If you've studied comp sci or anything at all it's like comparing O(n to 5th power/4) vs O(n) -- which is still an exponential upon exponential rate of difference per node over time. Again, what you're saying isn't adding up.
