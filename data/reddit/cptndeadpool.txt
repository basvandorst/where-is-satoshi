and tbh, I think one of the reasons is that it seems that the "side" that is pushing for legalization often also makes the argument "and tax revenue"

So a paper wallet would be like, having the e-mail/password to an e-mail account. But never actually opening the e-mail account when it is connected to the internet. That way your computer/iphone/whatever isn't hacked when you are logging onto your account.
is that a decent way to think of paper wallet?
if so how does....you wallet now how much money is in it if it isn't connected to the internet? Or is it, just your device is not connected to the internet version of your wallet (i.e. your email is always connected whether you log on or not).
Thanks I'm totally going to  use Gdax.
Thanks so much for your response it was supremely helpful.

well I'm not sure if anybody actually explained it to him or he is just listening through forbes magazine etc.
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:19:02
Awesome info.
So for the paper wallet funds get sent to it and are record in the block chain and you want actualyl see the funds til you connect to the internet and go to pay for something right?

So I've been using copay as a wallet but might switch to exodus.
I'm looking into the long term buying n trading etc.
I am using coinbase (though it sucks to get hit with transfer fees so often)
is there anyway to avoid getting hit with tons of transfer fees? buying fee on cionbase, transferring to wallet fee?
Is there any easy way to send money from CB to wallet without punching in your bitcoin address?
Also for a noobie would it be safer to just leave the funds in CB? 
Also I guess I'm still confused on how all transactions are anonymous when they have your bitaddress (p.s. I hope that's the right word). 
What do people mean by a "paper" wallet and how is that less likely to get hacked than an app or copay or w/e.
Sorry for the long string of questions, I've looked online but most are too complex for me, and this sub is 99% memes.
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:17:59
Ok thanks for the info. Sorry also nub question. What do you mean by backup? I realize there are multiple videos out there and I have watched them + read the FAQ but they don't seem to help too much.
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:15:12
wellllll one of the reason black market prices are lower are due to excess taxes/regulations (that's why selling loose cigarettes is a thing).
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:30:32
oh, ok I did all that, that's what I thought awesome. 
Turns out copay doens't support 2fa that coinbase does, trying to figure out how to "re-play the request"

I posted that last week, I was hoping I would see some lively debate about what he was right and what he was wrong about.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:57:12
Ur debit charges you that much?
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:04:44
Damn my debit doesn't charge me at all. Wtf.
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:29:11
not to get crazy political but this sort of stuff has to make me laugh.
You seem (and I'm sorry if I'm wrong) to be a far left occupy individual who believes big banks are running as all and are corrupt so we need to get away with them by using crypto.
Whereas I am a super ultra libertarian who thinks the banks are really the problem (or "corporate oppression" as you called it) and it it's really all the problems originating with the state. I'm of the opinion that their is no "corporate oppression" because they can't be violent with me only the "state" can. the corporates can have just "voluntary exchange" just like bit coin.
I just find it hilarious that we both feel so differently but arrive at the same conclusion.
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:10:36
looks like im totally wrong thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-08 02:23:03
you're right. that's totally possible doomsday scenario. can you give me a time when this happened? 
other than when socialists come into power.
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:09:58
Damn dude fire with the callout. 
Not tryna sound like a douche but you wouldn't happen to make ur shirts fitted would ya?

it's treated as capitaol gains so actually you can take net losses in bitcoin and hold them against your income :)
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:20:58
I do not thing that high wealth inequality results in losing constitutional rights.
can you point me to an example?
@_date: 2017-09-07 00:33:02


well this isn't entirely true.
We understand supply and demand.
The government, could, potentially aggragate and bring the price down for medical prices but when you decrease the price, you decrease the supply. That's law and econ 101.
You get a shortage. [here] ( [or here] (

have you ever driven on a road? if so then you are a hypocrite.
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:33:35
yes of course just like "drop the gun or I'll shoot" could be someone shooting a cop or a cop shooting a burglar.
context is a hell of a drug.
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:44:41
how would forced redistribution of wealth solve that?
@_date: 2017-09-07 00:25:55
hey so I'm not sure about this but I would think that spending it on another product avoids the capital gains tax?
You aren't actually gaining income. That's my laymens understanding though.
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:38:46
but corporations were people until the state classified them differently.
If I sell you a computer for $5 who has 5$? or the CORPORATION @_date: 2017-09-12 13:34:55


so you'd like a zerod out capital gains tax?
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:25:18
that's not true at all, the plot of land was purchased by my parents from another individual, which in legal terms actually makes us a bona fide purchaser and if there is any compensation for damages it would be from the thieve not the purchasers, but I wouldn't expect you to know property law.
Let's go back further, let's go back to the days of the settlers. Well you have no idea if anybody was on the this plot of land. maybe it wasn't even settled. maybe it was an open plot of land an individual put up for wooden posts and a wire and said this is mine. you don't know that.
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:26:44
can I ask, just to learn my self,  why you see banking as an expression of kleptocracy?
this seems like a fairly radical position but that makes me all the more interested.
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:33:19
that's cuz people are explaining this wrong. 
If you have losses you actually get to use this to offset any capital gains you make and even some of your personal income you make.
capital gains is how much you literally gained. If you sold it for shit you made shit.

but the thing is, deflation is only caused by people valuing currency more, that only happens when people are spending money.
If nobody spends the currency, then nobody wants it.

Offering aid for children imo is different from paying for adults who don't like to work.
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:11:14
even if that's true.
Is it really right to say "hey you better spend this or else I'll steal it"
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:14:31
well it's not bullshit he just gave an amazingly simplified version.
I was in Food Lion the other day, and there was a 12 pack of soda for 5$ or a 24 pack for 6$. I no doubt got the 24 pack 
However if the 24 pack was 20 minutes away, I'd probably just grab the 12 pack. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:30:27
that's not true. I am laying on a couch. I did not acquire this with violence. and yes my rights are defended with violence just like many of our rights.
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:49:39
but when you decrease the price so far that they supply is so low that not everyone gets it, then you run into a problem.
I'm not sure what the fascination is with single payer, maybe bernie sanders, but plenty of other countries run multi payer systems to ensure universality.
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:32:42
not sure if you realize this but citing surveys of people's opinions doesn't qualify as a fact.
@_date: 2017-09-08 02:22:26
I would not.
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:38:10


paying employees in order to make more money in the long run.


that's a logical assumption I do not agree with.


that's why we have a constitution to prevent the minority from the majority.


lol. I legit spent 6 hours today writing a paper on why the everyone in the U.S. should be thankful for their free speech that isn't enjoyed in other countries.


never disagreed with that, but that is a non sequiter

just stumbled on this.
How would CB know this? 
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:18:37
well I think this post is not covering all of the bases. It's important to understand WHY something is increasing in worth.
It's because it's more valuable which right now is a good thing for bitcoin.
