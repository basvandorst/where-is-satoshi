Is there a trusted exchange which deals in AUD and also allow STOP/LIMIT buys/Sells? Thanks in advance.

Oh, it says they’re online in this. Which subs do you recommend? (Crypto currencies etc)?

Basically what you are telling the exchange is I don’t wish to sell or buy until it reaches a certain dollar figure. If you are putting a stop loss on - the figure is lower than you own.  Example is if: I held one bit coin worth $23,000 to limit my loss I can tell the exchange that I wish to sell all or part of my bitcoin if the price drops to below 18k$. That way I mitigate the risk if falls any further. I hope that makes sense

How long does it take to get a coinspot account after submitting all the Incredible amount of ID material including a photo of yourself holding a criminal like poster?

Thanks Binders, but I’m not sure you are correct, the market was at 24,000 when I placed the $18,000. I think what you mean is that the market was going up and I missed the $18,000 slot (ie The market was below 18,000 when I placed the order. Not right) and it didn’t sell till 20 3K. Does that make sense?
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:16:36
No! Or or lower! That’s close to 18,000 as possible

Don’t want a derivative xchange. Simply want one ( with invitation needed) that I can do stop loss trades on.

I believe it’s the same thing. It’s where you place your limit that creates the stoploss
