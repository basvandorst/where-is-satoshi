Even the pricing is the same. I, too, would like to know why I should use this over bitspend. 
@_date: 2013-03-13 09:56:36
Nobody said anything about this being a scam. It just looks like the same exact business model as bitspend, and offers nothing competitive, at least not evidently, that would draw in customers.

Interesting, thank you! Looks like I need to do more research on callback urls ...

The drop down menu doesn't work for me on mobile (Android using Chrome)
@_date: 2013-03-22 08:34:57
Probably has to do with that being a big order.

I've had a good experience with bitfloor. Quick cash deposit at Bank of America, with only 1% fee, and then purchase btc once the $ are in your account (within 1/2 hour)

Nothing is free.  Time is money.

Too bad with all my karma I only got about 0.09 usd,  and it says a minimum tip is 0.10 
@_date: 2013-04-02 23:43:32
If you have a Bank of America nearby, use Bitfloor.

Gonna try this with my bitcoin tip address
@_date: 2013-03-13 12:13:23
Cool. Love the baby pictures, btw.

I could care less about the correct usage of his expression. 
@_date: 2013-03-13 09:58:37
Competition is good because it challenges businesses to grow and improve. I'm not sure what this new service offers that would challenge bitspend.

I use blockchain.info to watch a brain wallet I made.
