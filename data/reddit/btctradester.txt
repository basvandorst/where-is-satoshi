These guys first found a fundamental problem, then proposed a fix for it, then proposed a fix for the latest disaster, and you're still being a dick. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 03:07:30
No, small pools are still viable.
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:49:15
Wasn't it cunicula who kept saying that selfish mining would never work and no pool would go over 50%? Wrong on two separate accounts.

Their latest announcement, google it.

This is depressing.

That looks like a converted storage unit.
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:42:11
You keep saying "nothing happened" over and over again. What did happen is that we all became GHash's bitches. Our currency became GHash's currency. I lost the ability to say "hey guys, this Bitcoin thing is very cool, it's all decentralized, you don't have to trust anyone, come check it out."
So yeah, that happened. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:54:22
When people say "it loses the value proposition," they are not talking about the Bitcoin price. They are talking about our ability to get new people to use Bitcoin. The Bitcoin price is irrelevant once we lose the ability to differentiate ourselves from funny money administered by some website.
@_date: 2014-06-19 04:17:26
This doesn't work because pools can hide and masquerade as multiple other pools.
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:58:58
So, this is good for Bitcoin?

Who goes to the front page of tumblr?

The problem with 51% miners is that they can convert their short-term position to a long-term situation that is not good for Bitcoin. Other miners might just leave, because they don't want to be someone else's bitch, and try to compete with a monopoly. Users might leave because who wants to use a "decentralized currency" that is actually centralized.

Thank you for posting this. Peter has done more for Bitcoin than the OP and the  104 idiots who upvoted the OP combined and multiplied by any number. 
I also don't understand the hatred towards the Selfish Mining guys. Anyone who studied the protocol, including Gavin, Greg and the rest of the core team, will tell you that it is quite real. The latest suggestion from them to break up pools is a reaction to GHash. Now, it may not be implemented, but it's good to have it in one's back pocket. How else can we have leverage over GHash? By begging here constantly? By creating all-caps threads? By DDoS? Their solution is nothing short of elegant, and comes at just the right time. Non-outsourcable puzzles are an interesting recent development in academic crypto circles, and their solution is not only very flexible but also maintains the existing miner balance. I am not quite sure if they can devise an auto adjustment mechanism that works, but that's besides the point. You all wanted a mechanism to deter GHash, and they fucking gave it to you, and you're trying to badmouth them in passing? While you try to shit on a core dev? And we're supposed to take you seriously?
Frankly, OP clearly doesn't give a fuck about the long-term viability of Bitcoin, and just wants to pepper over real problems until he can find a greater fool to unload his coins onto. That's the worst of what this community has to offer.
If Peter and the selfish mining guys are part of a conspiracy to bring down Bitcoin, they are doing a piss poor job, because from what I can see, they've all been working to improve the protocol. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 02:01:02
You missed the parent's sarcasm. He didn't really mean the first sentence. I learned this by reading his second sentence, something you should do on occasion.
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:40:18
The price did take a hit, you moron. Let me say it once again for the fuckin' get-rich-quick cult members here who are just looking to unload their Bitcoin and aren't committed to its future: Once Bitcoin is no different from GHash-coin, there will be no new users to sell to.
@_date: 2014-06-19 04:44:07
Do you see the US Government trying to establish a monopoly over Bitcoin? Did you not already see GHash actually become a Bitcoin monopoly? 
@_date: 2014-06-19 04:22:30


Someone is still saying this post GHash? Did you not see the gazillion threads calling miners all kinds of names because they kept flocking to GHash even after the 50% point?
@_date: 2014-06-20 03:46:11
Nope, it's a credible attack. There has been independent confirmations with different simulators. A selfish miner over 33% is guaranteed to succeed. Smaller selfish miners may succeed if they are well-connected and they are not up against big miners. 
The OP seems to not like anyone who says anything negative, even when those people have put in hours upon hours of their time into improving the protocol, like Peter has, and they are pointing out a genuine problem. 
 
@_date: 2014-06-19 14:07:21
GHash owns 25% of their own hardware, so only 14% of the total hash power. If we could prohibit pools, we'd fix them. But posts like this, which focus on the wrong problem, don't help.
@_date: 2014-06-18 04:00:50
Did you look through the blockchain? They did it on June 2nd, June 6th, and then again for a whole freaking day on the 13th. "One short moment in time" it is not. They clearly have a lot of capacity.
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:57:21
This was his rebuttal:
1. He got the prisoner's dilemma wrong. Go to wikipedia, compare the payout matrix.
2. He said no one would ever go over 50%. GHash happened.
He's voluminous, I'll grant you that. Wish he was more, you know, correct.
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:50:41
Everyone said that miners will self-regulate to remain below 50%. That did not happen.
So now the same people are repeating the same crappy argument, even though it failed to predict the past. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:07:03
This isn't the best thing that can happen to Bitcoin, but for a change it is actually a good thing.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:50:37
Ok, we're done here.
@_date: 2014-06-20 03:56:48
My fave blog as of late! Those guys were proven right every which way. Selfish Mining was independently checked by a simulator, and if you play with it, you can see that it makes more money than the standard strategy. And they said that pools can go over 50% and we just had GHash. And they keep suggesting fixes for problems. Anyone attacking them now sticks out like a moron. 
Not surprisingly, the same moron is here to attack one of the core devs. Sheesh. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:57:41
I don't think the authors are engaged in FUD at all. They outline a bunch of attacks and double spends are not even one of them. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:38:11
You realize that all the earnings go to a single address owned by a single entity, right?
@_date: 2014-06-17 05:18:00
Your level-headed stance does not belong on this subreddit. Time to DDoS GHash!!! /sarcasm
@_date: 2014-06-19 12:30:29


Best part of the story.
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:05:53
Wait, I can see that you're writing condescending comments to the authors. 
On the one hand, there is you, random redditor, who has done nothing to help Bitcoin gain acceptance except maybe went door to door like Jehovah's witnesses and wrote stupid letters to B&amp;H Photo. 
OTOH, these guys just proposed a fix for the most catastrophic thing that happened to Bitcoin. 
I know who I'd like on my side. And the more you guys act like dicks, the more you drive away the smart people who can actually make Bitcoin succeed.
@_date: 2014-06-17 04:18:15
You're mostly using known words and making new sentences with them. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:47:47
I can't tell if you're for letting GHash become a monopoly, or against.
But I can tell that your model of what will happen is basically BS.
@_date: 2014-06-19 04:24:38
Double-spends are not the problem. Double-spends were never the problem.
@_date: 2014-06-19 11:51:53
Argh, when will you idiots stop making excuses? Did you read anything by these guys? Do you not understand that you can no longer use the word "decentralized trust" as long as someone is over 50%? 
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:00:29
Why the fuck would anyone care, and how come these dumbass posts get more upvotes than, say, the 51% GHash situation?
That said, good on you. Nothing personal, and wish you the best. But come on guys, there's far more at stake here.
@_date: 2014-06-19 04:27:50


Gee, did you not just live through the GHash 51% thing? 
@_date: 2014-06-20 04:17:39
To truly match Bitcoin, you should create a marketplace where the only vendor is GHash.io
Just kidding, keep up the good work!
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:11:50
ITT, dumbassery. Protocol modification suggestions from people who would never recognize a protocol spec if they saw one. 
"Force a single P2Pool"? Mandatory standard? I want some of what you have been smoking.
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:01:27
You didn't understand the solution.
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:18:23


please fight GHash and the other large miners then.


you do not understand how the blockchain works and how much the public can see and trace your transactions.
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:16:44
Hey, it did happen and GHash is not out of business. In fact, it looks like they're back in business. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 00:36:35
How do you know the different ways they make money? 
@_date: 2014-06-20 03:48:56
A block is a block. Whether or not the payoff is comes from the block reward or the transaction fees is just not relevant. If anything, SM was over-attacked by idiots like the OP who don't know the first thing about the protocol. It remains the biggest protocol flaw found in Bitcoin to date.
 
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:54:05
What makes you so sure that you understand everything there is to know about GHash's revenue stream? Maybe GHash wants to depress the Bitcoin economy for a while so some Russian tycoon can sweep up some coins? They'd be crazy to go over 50%, right? But they did. So your reasoning doesn't work.


I see, we're denying reality now. Good luck with that. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 04:23:57
You should read the proposal more carefully. It won't be feasible for the first stagers to send all of their solutions to the pool and have the pool do the second stage, because the work involved in the second stage is non-trivial. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 22:27:15
This isn't right. A miner will solve whatever percentage of overall blocks (in the blockchain plus orphaned; solved blocks of any kind) he has the hashrate for. If he's selfish, he will be able to keep the competitors' blocks out of the blockchain. 
Initially, his revenues per unit time will be identical to what they would be if he was not selfish (the number of blocks he got onto the blockchain will not change), except his competitors will earn less money because their blocks are not appearing on the blockchain, and the time between blocks will be higher than 10 minutes. 
When difficulty adjusts, blocks will be created every 10 minutes, his competitors' blocks will still not appear on the blockchain (because our selfish miner will be competing with them and keeping them out of the blockchain), and the selfish guy's earnings per unit time will be far higher than his fair share because he will be the creator of all the blocks on the chain, and his competitors' blocks will end up as orphans.
I simplified a bit: the selfish guy will not be able to keep every block from every competitor out of the blockchain. Some percent of competing blocks will succeed. On average, the selfish guy has some success rate as a percentage of blocks, and that remains the same. 
I hope you can see that there is no ramp up period to selfish mining, and there is no downside. I am not sure if my explanation here was the clearest but I'm happy to explain it further if this description plus some work with pencil and paper does not make it clear.

I read some of his proposals carefully, and they were always flawed in some way or another.
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:46:24
Until two days ago, everyone used economic arguments for why GHash would never even achieve 51%. This argument is pretty much dead.

@_date: 2014-06-20 12:55:03
Selfish miners routinely make their blocks public and will collect the block rewards as this happens. The difficulty correction will just fix things so that the rate comes out to be the same again. Until that happens (it'd take half a month on average), the extra money you can make through selfish mining can more than compensate for the drop in block discovery rate.
