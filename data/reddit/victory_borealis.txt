Since the end of the evil nemesis Bitcointipbot, Changetip/Changecoin has led the way in companies without a plan to make profit. As the offramp for Bitcoin, Changetip/Changecoin pioneered spam tipping, and useless tips to celebrities. Recently Changetip/Changecoin pivoted to allow for USD to play a larger role. This was to encourage those who are "scared" of bitcoin to still tip others, and continue the circle of spam. Without you guys Changetip/Changecoin could not have tipped Changetip/Changecoin employess so effectively. So in closing...SO long and thanks for all the tips.

This is a huge step forward in the Internet of things, to preload it would kinda defeat the purpose.  Like if you gave away tips randomly and for no good merit.
