Using [Bitcoinity]( I'm seeing 63+ on MtGox but only $59 on BTCE.  Why the disparity?
If I had an arbitrage bot running on both exchanges right now, would that work?  This difference is too huge to pass up.

Just a hunch.  The March correction seemed to happen right as we crossed €200.  Remember how we were going to save Greece with the bitcoin?

It used to say that in the parent title, at least it did when I originally submitted it to Hacker News on the 24th.  A moderator removed it later, to much internal argument.

Gonna be a rough night for some.   Gox trades are all over the place.

If you've been reading for the last week or two, Coinbase has had some serious problems.  My advice would have been to stay away, but it's too late for that.  Just cross your fingers and wait.
Any Fiat ACH needs a normal 2-3 days to clear, and Sundays are not banking days in the US.  So maybe you'll see something soon.

That's a great chart, thanks for the link.

Bitfloor seemed nice and I even had a Capital One 360 checking account when I discovered them.  But why are 360 P2P transfers not instant?  That's such a bummer.

That's some good communication.  Can you imagine if they didn't say anything for hours or days (cough cough *Coinbase*)?
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:01:33
This is too fucking great.  I've already tipped Kacper, I should do it again.

I'm trying to figure out how to cancel my Coinbase account before I get some kind of "collection notice" on these missing bitcoins.  =)

Something tells me we won't hit $500 on this run.  3000 Yuan is about USD $492.  There will probably be a big chinese freakout at that level.
@_date: 2013-03-20 20:14:20
Good point.  Thanks.

Well, from everything I've seen so far (including their website), Coinbase has exactly one programmer.  So "levels of talent" is kind of a misnomer.
@_date: 2013-03-29 18:33:42
STOP RECOMMENDING COINBASE.

Google Auth is great, use that.

Holy shit me too.  Thought I was getting away with something here.

Blockchain says he's got 0.0830572 BTC so far (~ $100 USD). Smart kid!
When I was in college a smart kid wrote to the columnist in the Chicago Tribune and said "if willing people out there just sent me a penny, I could probably pay for my tuition".  He got it (and more):
[EDIT] 0.08484295 BTC now!  I bet this kid winds up with a few hundred bucks.
[EDIT 2] Didn't even notice the 'HiMom' until just now.  Awesome!
[EDIT 3] Well.  I was *WAY* off on this one.  Good for him!

Same here.  I went in one last time to check if I had anything left in my account and it says I now have -4.00 BTC in my wallet.   Nice.

40,000 BTC is moving out of Instawallet.  Safety measure or robbery in progress?

Wanna bet someone is going to execute a market order and pay $10,000 for a Bitcoin?

Bitcoinrider, were you invested in Bitcoin back in the summer 2011 runup?  Do you have any insight as to what happened there and how it differs from today?
I'm not completely sold on the idea that Cyprus/Eurozone investors are what's making the market happen today.  I think it's a nice story and helps bolster the idea that Bitcoin can complete with fiat, but I get this bad sense that a lot of new investors are going to take a bath just like they did in 2011.  Just my opinion.

And what the fuck is this shit?
Someone hack their twitter account or is this how they normally work?
@_date: 2013-03-23 12:42:17
STAY AWAY FROM COINBASE.  PERIOD.
Nothing is moving in or out of there for days.  Some people have been waiting for almost a week to get stuff moved, even amounts already in BTC.  Balances have gone missing.   Check twitter and see how responsive Coinbase has been.  It's a mess.
