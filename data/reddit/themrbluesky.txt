If you want to do some detective work, one thing you can do to get more information about your lost bitcoins is by searching the address they went to on 
If you Google the recipient's address, it's possible that you might get the thief's identity if they were brazenly dumb enough to post the address online for other transactions.

Where are the open source designs located online?

I suppose the same thing that happens when people print money illegally.
But you might say that hacking bitcoin is a Bit less trivial.

And then the BTC price artificially hit the roof. WHY DO I BUY AND SELL WITH YOU PEOPLE.

I don't think it works like that.
Wouldn't you have to dig back in the block chain and break every single transaction up to that very old transaction in order to change who owns those bitcoins? That would include breaking the transactions made with the new algorithm.

Haha I'm in the same situation.

One reason this is a GREAT idea:
Bitcoin isn't really ideal for over the counter quick purchases because the confirmation time can take a while. Usually a middle-man is suggested for that problem. At a bar that's not an issue, because the guy that bought the drink is going to be hanging around at the bar for a while. You can make all purchases directly in Bitcoin and just get on his ass if it doesn't go through. 
I wish you luck with your brewery!

I think the best solution is to make the block size limit a function of something. It should grow dynamically like the difficulty. 
Fitting it to a curve that grows at the rate of Moore's Law (of storage space) would be ideal.

I thought it was great. It made me laugh quite a bit. You realize it's a comedy show, right? 
Anyone that has any interest whatsoever will go to bitcoin.org and learn what the currency is REALLY about.

I wrote a script to flood the phisher with fake username/password combinations. Hopefully this will dilute their database enough to make it impossible for them to use against anyone else.

I got 0.05 BTC for free from the bitcoin faucet. 
Back when that was a nickel's worth. 
Good times.

That's it? If you had a 100 Bitcoins, you'd do two chicks at the same time?

Lmao I love this story. What's the original source?
@_date: 2013-03-18 15:34:36
Just create a new address.

I don't think so, because in this game there's more factors than JUST computers getting faster. 
You've also got to take into account that more and more people are joining in on the mining, and that itself looks to be exponential. 
The hash rate is going to increase at the rate of adoption + Moore's Law.

I keep seeing the USD referred to as a "Ponzi scheme", and I'd love to hear the argument for it.

It could be worse. I got scammed out of $3,000. 
Edit: Though I've still made thousands, so I'm not one to complain. It's a learning experience.

Here's the script:  in case anyone is interested. 
It requires a wordlist in the same directory as the script. The file can be found here: 
Any one of them will work if they're just renamed to "wordlist".
