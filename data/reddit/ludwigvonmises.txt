The general consensus is wrong; most Bitcoiners are not economists nor are they familiar with how monetary systems work. Bitcoin does not "need" more merchant adoption - it will eventually get this - but what it needs is liquidity, which is created by high Bitcoin prices and new technological use-cases.
@_date: 2016-04-13 13:43:38
You *are* investing. You're investing in the coins themselves. Yes you're "tying up" coins, but spending is not the goal. You can't spend a currency to success. Hoarding is beneficial and leads to higher Bitcoin prices which leads to greater stability, liquidity, and interest.
@_date: 2016-04-12 20:42:31
Frankly I think this is a good thing. Merchant adoption is not the end-goal. They will join eventually, but far better it is to invest in the currency (meaning holding it) and its applications in remittance and black/grey market activities.

You're assuming the government has a legitimate right to demand tax payments, but you haven't proved that yet. You suppose, implicitly, that without a tax funded monopoly, nobody would be willing to pay for public services voluntarily, but that isn't borne out by theory or history. Safety nets for the poor were handled by mutual aid, fraternal orders, private charity, and other methods before the advent of the welfare state, for instance. Other sorts of public services have commonly been provided by organizations and associations who take the lead in providing them and by supporters and consumers who want to participate. Taxation isn't necessary.


There is no "race to the bottom." The game theoretic outcome of a stateless society is that markets and social organizations provide for necessary services on a voluntary and commercial basis. But perhaps you're more familiar with some of the literature than I am. Care to list some examples?
Edit: Regardless of whether you think society would collapse or thrive without taxation, what about taxation makes it not theft? Do you think it is somehow a voluntary system?
@_date: 2019-07-31 14:11:28
Taxes are collected under threat of force. If you don't pay your tax bill, a chain of events begins where continued resistance to their demands means armed men come to your home to kidnap you and put you in a cage. If you resist your kidnapping, they will kill you. This makes the state intrinsically no different than a protection racket: "pay up or else." 
All the benefits of government services - real or dubious - are predicated on their ability to raise revenue through threats of force and they could not exist without it. That they spend taxes on things you like doesn't justify the taxes in the first place any more than my robbing you at your door so I can use the money to fix your cracked driveway justifies the robbery.
People will argue that my living in society justifies the imposition of taxes because they believe (tax funded) government is necessary for civilization. They are wrong. There is plenty of literature on how society can organize necessary protection and judicial services without a centralized monopoly of violence. Because taxes are coercively obtained, with no contract or consent, this makes it morally indistinguishable from mass theft or extortion.
@_date: 2019-07-31 16:59:49
Good point. Theft has an obvious negative connotation (which, I would say, is not unwarranted given the accepted negativity of forceful taking), but using the term to stir up the negative emotional connotations was not my point (though it may well be for many libertarians). Extortion is the more correct term to use, and it has less of a connotative response to it, so I prefer to use it - unfortunately it doesn't roll off the tongue as well. 
Thanks for the article; good read.

There's a secret third option which is to allow miners to set their own block sizes.
In your false dichotomy example, however, I would argue it is in the *rightly understood, long-run interests* of everyone to prefer option 2 to option 1.
Scaled, centralized payment networks already exist (1 without 2), whereas there are no such examples of small, decentralized payment networks (2 without 1). The decentralization of Bitcoin should be considered more preferable to its scaling, and I believe this is well understood by anyone who follows the Cypherpunk and crypto-anarchist history of the emergence of this kind of technology; it's never been about "how fast can we push this to everyone regardless of its merits?"; the priority is getting the product right (a p2p money) first, and expanding it to more people second.

You're not familiar with the essence of Daoism, are you? Lou-tzu's work the Daodejing (from which this quote is taken) is both a primer on life and a manual for rulers/leaders. The greatest leader is one who doesn't lead, like the best government is one which doesn't govern.
It's not a refuge for corporate executives - they are by definition the ones actively trying to shape their employees to maximize production. Besides, corporate executives love to take credit for what the company does, and Lou-tzu says elsewhere (in the Daodejing) that the Dao loves and nourishes everything, but lays no claim to it. From Chapter 34:
The great Tao flows everywhere.
All things are born from it,
yet it doesn't create them.
**It pours itself into its work,**
**yet it makes no claim.**
**It nourishes infinite worlds,**
**yet it doesn't hold on to them.**
Since it is merged with all things
and hidden in their hearts,
it can be called humble.
Since all things vanish into it
and it alone endures,
it can be called great.
It isn't aware of its greatness;
thus it is truly great.

You're forgetting the disequilibrating effects of changes in the money supply. "Small inflation" hurts the ability for the price system - denominated in *any kind* of money - to accurately convey information. 
Despite that money's purpose isn't to store value, in order for anything to be a money, it has to store some amount of value simply to be used at all. And when the value of those money units change, the people who held on to them are worse off. That should be clear. If you're holding $100 anticipating that you can buy a week's groceries with it, and suddenly its value drops, you won't be able to buy what you want. The question isn't necessarily "can this money unit still be used for exchange" in some general, aggregate sense as you posit. It's more like "this money unit is getting worse at being a reliable way to exchange value."

"Working really hard" is not incompatible with Daoist precepts. What is incompatible with Daoist precepts is striving, glory-seeking, selfish, self-aggrandizing behavior. Once Bitcoin gained any sort of forward momentum, Satoshi slipped behind the curtain and was (almost) never heard from again. The way the software was engineered was that a central leader was unnecessary.


Yes, perhaps. A Daoist leader is ideally unknown, anonymous, hidden. He is no more worthy of attention than the head of a sanitation department. This is not perfectly Satoshi, but there is a good argument to be made that his leadership was rather Daoist because it was not heavy-handed, it was not self-important, he did not seek fame or glory, etc.

It's probably best to let comment on this - but I'd argue there's 2 main reasons:
1) Voorhees is a business man and a libertarian, and so would be the last person in the world to renounce embarking on profitable ways to satisfy people's idiosyncratic desires; if there's a market for something, why would he thumb his nose at it?
2) Shapeshift is the best way to undermine all altcoins, because it allows for anyone who owns altcoins to instantly convert them to bitcoin. This is basically a cryptocurrency version of a foreign exchange market, and it would make crypto speculators conduct speculative attacks on altcoins much easier than it otherwise would be.

That's an interesting point. One of the economically salient things about a money substitute is that there's always a value discount vis-a-vis the commodity money it represents (if for no other reason than one absorbs counterparty risk when taking on money substitutes, but not money proper). 
I'm curious about what the monetary scene looks like if a payment network can be built on top of Bitcoin without the end user absorbing ANY counterparty risk - in other words, if the payment token were as "trustless" as Bitcoin itself.

The fact that it is controlled by a cabal of politicians, bankers, and regulators is my proof. Fiat currency is inherently inflationary because the incentives of those managing the currency are different from those using the currency. Rulers and central bankers have always devalued currencies when it benefited them, and historically this has led to hyperinflations, forced currency conversions, regressions to barter, etc.
The dynamics of fiat money production contain the seed of its own destruction.
From Chris Mack at [ResourceInvestor](
"The average life expectancy for a fiat currency is 27 years, with the shortest life span being one month. Founded in 1694, the British pound Sterling is the oldest fiat currency in existence. At a ripe old age of 317 years it must be considered a highly successful fiat currency. However, success is relative. The British pound was defined as 12 ounces of silver, so it's worth less than 1/200 or 0.5% of its original value. **In other words, the most successful long standing currency in existence has lost 99.5% of its value.**"

Only because the monetary wizards at the Fed are inflating it. When gold was cash, it was very prudent to save it for the long term because it appreciated.

If a very large percentage of miners stop mining, the difficulty collapses to the point where the remaining miners can continue validating transactions according to their mining contributions. The only real difference would be a corresponding reduction in the security of the network - ie, it becomes much easier for adversaries to mount 51% attacks on the network. This would undoubtedly have an effect on the price of Bitcoin, etc., but as far as "permanently destroying" Bitcoin - no, nothing can do that.

This reminds me of a classic Zen koan where (as a fictional story) an army lieutenant tells a sage about a goose who's grown inside of a bottle, and he asks: How can you get the goose out of the bottle without breaking the bottle or injuring the goose?
In response, the master gave a tour to the army man commenting on how beautiful the outside was, how delightful various sights and smells are, etc. After some time conversing, it became very late, and the lieutenant, without getting any satisfactory answer, decided he'd had enough of this old fool's meanderings and got up to leave. As he reached for the door, the Zen master shouts out: "There! He's out!"
Koans aren't supposed to have any singular, rational answer - but the message in this story is pretty clear: you have to get the goose to leave of his own volition. In this case, the question becomes - how to extract Hearn and his personality from Bitcoin without destroying either? The natural course of Bitcoin development did that for us.

I would interpret those as two different effects. You can have a mental attachment towards using a particular currency for your expenses, and you can have a mental attachment with how much something normally costs (in real terms). You can experience both at the same time, of course, but I would categorize the latter as sticky prices. Not sure what to call the former. In any case, the USD does enjoy additional currency support just for being the incumbent, as you mentioned.


No argument there. I don't think bitcoin adoption would inherently push us towards this, though (or, if so, not as a major effect). I think a cultural push towards financial independence would effect that stronger.


So is the difference between a hockey stick adoption curve and an S curve simply that, in the latter, there will always be some fiat residual? I have 50 trillion Zimbabwe dollars across the room from me now. Would you consider that as fiat residual? It's not being used in any economic sense, so I don't think it's right to count that as "fiat clings to life." If that doesn't count, then I can't imagine anyone using fiat commercially in the future (20, 50, 100 years, whatever the relevant time horizon), so that's why I see it as hockey stick growth.
@_date: 2019-08-14 14:27:56


I understand, and I don't disagree. This isn't sticky prices, however. That has to do with people's expectations regarding the stability of prices given a unit of account.
Changing the unit of account won't happen overnight, but at some point bitcoin will be stable enough to emerge as a competitor unit of account. When it does, and when merchants begin pricing their goods in it, and offering steeper and steeper discounts for it, then customers will begin to switch over to paying for things in bitcoin, and the old price system won't be used anymore.
While that (hyperbitcoinization) is happening, prices in the terms of old fiat currency will accelerate massively as the demand to hold that cash declines. So we will see prices in one price system essentially explode upward as it loses popularity and the other decline rapidly as per its deflationary design, reinforcing that pattern even further. Legal tender laws and such will stall it a bit, but mismanagement of fiat currency by QE, NIRP, helicopter money, geopolitical issues, etc. will ensure its demise.

No such thing as gradual hyperbitcoinization. It's growth will become exponential as the price of bitcoin changes relative to the price of USD. The faster BTC rises, the faster it will rise because it becomes more secure and liquid compared to the declining currency. It will happen faster than people expect. We are not good at thinking in logarithmic terms.

Good observation. One thought: The "correct" price of Bitcoin, that is, what Coinbase and Bitstamp are willing to sell bitcoin for, is grossly and fantastically under-valued. It's a correct price given the limited knowledge traders and institutions have regarding future globalization, fiat displacement, hyperbitcoinization, etc.
"Bitcoin is poised for exponential growth, so the opportunity costs of not being involved to the highest personal degree possible are incalculable. Yet merchants, investment peddlers, and other hoarders have been able to convince countless bitcoiners to part with their future riches, despite the obvious downsides given you have a long enough time horizon to see the coming post-fiat world. They’ll tell you spending is vital, that Bitcoin 2.0 will be even better if only you give them some of your Bitcoin 0.9, or that your bitcoins are worth only $475 a piece. They’ll tell you this with a straight face, the wringing of their hands unseen across the Internet. And once you have fallen to temptation, they’ll leave you on your own to learn there are no ‘backsies’. In the realpolitik of the block chain, everyone is a scammer. There is a war going on for your bitcoins, and willpower is your only defense."

I'm making a judgment on the limited foresight of most people in the Bitcoin space. The current price reflects expectations of failure, volatility, risk, etc. Certainly.

You can't presuppose what you're trying to prove: that the State is some legitimate organization.
By describing the use of publicly-funded roads as "giving permission," you are implying that one can stop all association with it at any time (like disassociating from Wendy's or Newsweek magazine or a Chamber of Commerce). The State is nothing like that. It robs us, monopolizes industries, and has the gall to say we "give permission" for its horrible crimes by virtue of utilizing the only game in town.
I suppose, then, that people living in Cuba or East Germany were "giving permission" to their governments to commit their wrongdoings every second of every day.
Edit: Also, it's not like if I stop using the roads, the State will refund my money and stop extorting me in the future. The robbery is always present; the question is: will you use the products created through robbery?
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:06:06

1) Cuba and East Germany are examples of a reductio ad absurdum - I'm not suggesting we live in them. I used them to demonstrate your argument is facile; according to your logic, anyone who lived/lives in those countries must by definition give permission for their governments to do anything. This is clearly implausible. Therefore, simply using government-sponsored resources is not giving permission.
2) Again, you are presupposing what you are trying to prove: that the State is legitimate. You're telling me "take it or leave it." Why? Why am I the one that has to leave if I don't like it - why don't they stop robbing me? Your argument demonstrates you ALREADY think the State has some base legitimacy, like they were here "first" or something and I have to get their permission to live in this geography. That's a fallacy. If I knocked on your door and extorted you at gunpoint, you would have every right to tell me to bugger off. It would simply be stupid for someone defending me to tell you to "take it or leave it." It's your house!
2) a) I have more options than just leaving. The State doesn't own the land I live on; I am not their tenant. One of my options is to engage in peaceful discourse (such as right now, with you) and try to end the massive indoctrination campaign they are so successful at pulling off (see: you).
3) You're conflating modern society with State society. They are not mutually inclusive; I can have the former without having the latter.
Also, "the privilege" of modern society.. wow. I was unaware I was being granted a "privilege" of living among civilized people. Living free from aggression is not a natural, human right? Who should I be thanking? Our overlords?

It depends on the manner of growth. Do you support Bitcoin growth if it becomes centralized and the plaything of international banking cartels and governments?
I don't. I support Bitcoin growth where it is organic and true to Satoshi's vision - a distributed currency that gives the finger to governments and central banks. If governments try to fight or regulate Bitcoin use, they shoot themselves in the foot and only encourage a more insidious evolution of the currency (such as the creation of more anonymous tools, coins, and services). I favor all of these things.
@_date: 2015-08-24 18:32:11
1) And you are supporting their activities because you cannot imagine how restaurants could be reliably clean without regulators - that's a failure of imagination on your part.
2) Being unaware of various details does not mean an action is not voluntary. You're conflating voluntary activity with fully-informed activity. I'm not claiming consumers "would" do something - but that they can and are free to, to the extent regulators and people like you do not oppose their decision to.
3) So it is that basically only libertarians are aware of the enormous con being played on everyone in society.
4) Krishnamurti says, "It is no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society." I'm not particularly scared by how my opinions come across to Muggles and normal people. However, if I were given a few minutes with just such a "normal" person, I have no doubt I could impress upon them some doubt that they are kept safe by auto regulations or health inspectors. It is much more the fact that people are kept safe by means of things like locks, alarms, guns, fences, etc. (all privately provided) and the nature of mutually-interlocking self interest. Adam Smith says, "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest." If there were no "regulations" on food, do you think restaurants would willingly poison their customers? Why might that be an idiotic thing to do as a business owner?
5) You don't understand the nature of your question. You're asking me to come up with an imaginary innovation that COULD have come up IF IT WEREN'T for all these variables acting this way. That's not possible.
Let me put it another way. If you were brought into North Korea to act as their economic adviser, and you were in discussions with the leadership about de-nationalizing the food industry, and they were to ask you, "How many grocery stores would there be? What kind of vegetables would they stock? How long would they be sitting waiting? How spaced apart would the stores be? Etc. Etc." it would be impossible to speculate on this suffice to say that the incentives in freed markets are such that you can basically guarantee the North Korean people would be better fed without going into the minutiae of explicitly laying out individual details. Again, I suggest reading Bastiat.
6) No, they would not be less strict. Industry incumbents favor regulation because it prevents competition. Walmart was in favor of the Obamacare single payer system, not because they were generous or cared for the little worker making $9/hr, but because they are massive and can, with some adjustment, absorb the enormous compliance and overhead costs of this mandate whereas their smaller, more agile competitors cannot afford it. It's called regulatory capture - industry heads WANT regulation because it keeps their spot at the top secure while making life shitty for everyone.
7) If life went my way, I would not be a tax slave to an efficient and ruthless gang of stationary bandits extorting me every which way for money and property. I would be free to conduct business according to my own terms, I would be free to buy and sell anything, and I would have the responsibility of looking after my own life.
I am sorry you feel the need to outsource responsibility for your life to power-hungry bureaucrats who don't give a damn about you.

@_date: 2015-08-21 19:37:03
1) "So, yes, if a bank can't come up with $40k or even $100k they shouldn't be handling people's money." Okay, so it is YOU saying they shouldn't be able to do X or Y. You oppose the existence of a bank not being able to hold people's money safely - and more, you think they ought not to exist at all. That's being tyrannical. That's believing you have all the right ideas, and anything not implementing them should just be wiped off the market.
2) " restaurants who can't bother to clean shouldn't be allowed to serve food." They shouldn't be "allowed," you say. Who will be doing the "allowing?" Not the consumers of such a business, but regulators presumably. What arrogance. Do you deign to tell customers what kind of restaurant they can or cannot frequent? Supposing a single customer wanted to buy food at a dirty restaurant - you won't let them??
3) "Unsafe business practices" - you are acting like a central planner. Who is to say what is unsafe? Regulators with vested interests? Men in the street who know nothing? This is hubris. I mean, really. How dare you? If you can't imagine how banking officials might prevent Bitcoin innovation through regulatory channels, I'm not sure I can really help you.
4) I'm not a Bitcoin entrepreneur, just an economist. I'm not sure what innovations are being prevented, just that they are. This is the essence of Bastiat's "Seen and Unseen." We cannot see the possible avenues of innovation when they are unable to be manifested.
Antonopoulos makes this point with the Internet: if it had been regulated like a telecom company, many applications would not be able to exist today. This is perfectly analogous with treating Bitcoin companies like banks - it tries to fit superior technology into an antecedent paradigm, and, in so doing, neuters it and transforms it into just another, more efficient arm for typical banking channels.
Regulation doesn't outlaw ALL innovation, just any innovation that can't comply with the law. It's regulation that regresses Bitcoin companies into acting like banks - Bitcoin is supra-bank, and regulation forces any company that touches Bitcoin to essentially become a bank, because that is what they are familiar with.
All regulation is control and not for consumer protection purposes. That is a front, and you are gullible if you fall for it.

The Great Depression was a bust resulting from the preceding 10 year boom fueled by cheap credit from the new Federal Reserve. It wasn't a calculated banking conspiracy; just a natural response when elites try to control things they don't understand. Further, it wasn't WWII that got USA out of the Depression - it was only after the war, when all the wage and price control schemes got relaxed that national output improved (measured in terms of real consumer products, not arbitrary accounting fictions like GDP). It's a common misconception because we hear it all the time - and especially with certain economists advocating for a new war or some imaginary alien invasion so we can "jump start" the economy like they did in '45. It's rubbish, but if you believe wars improve economies, then you will believe that.

Totally wrong. NY is hurting itself - not Bitcoin. You have way too much trust in governments to do something like this. Even concerted international action against Bitcoin would be nothing, like a wave splashing against a ship.
It's not "VERY BAD." It's actually very good. Bitcoin should be pushed to the black markets as strongly as possible. I'm sorry you live in the Imperial Territory of New York - but take a larger perspective here. Bitcoin does not stand to gain by being accepted or integrated into States and governments; if anything, this sanitizes and neuters Bitcoin's value potential: to gently ease people into the agora. Every country in the world can ban Bitcoin and it will move to the underground markets and continue gaining strength - while governments lose favor hand over fist banning a popular, distributed technology.

Of course you can - they just won't adopt it instantly. When Bitcoin becomes too valuable and too strong to ignore, people won't care what their government has to say about it.

1) Because regulation crowds out alternative options - 
If it is against the law to hold funds without collecting X, Y and Z, then any innovation that doesn't collect X, Y, and Z cannot be implemented under threat of imprisonment and extortion. Regulation makes entire classes of innovation illegal.
2) The initial application fee is $5,000. This does not include the army of lawyers and compliance officers needed to interpret the rules, build the systems, and comply with these regulations. Bitstamp estimated it cost them $100,000 and I would not be surprised if that was a conservative estimate. 
3) Who are you to say that a company "shouldn't" be performing a marketplace function because they don't follow what YOU think they should be doing? This is analogous to when laymen argue that businesses that "can't afford" a higher minimum wage shouldn't be in business at all. It's complete effrontery to want to wipe out companies and firms because they aren't or can't do what you, in particular, want them to do.

3) How "good" of an economist I am is, obviously, up for debate. You can hold whatever opinions you like. But it is not an opinion that regulatory intervention is detrimental to the health of the market economy. The State is a parasite, not anything to be welcomed.
4) I cannot prove a negative. If I tell you there are unknown avenues that cannot be manifested, I cannot possibly tell you what they are. That's like asking what the geography of the United States would look like if there were no Constitution. Such a description is impossible because the variables are infinite and open-ended - such is human creativity.
5) You are drawing an arbitrary line in the sand. The Internet offers just as much disruption as Bitcoin does (arguably more since it was the platform on which Bitcoin could be created) - but somehow it doesn't "deserve regulation"?" Keep straight, man.

It does not "need to ride on top of banking and regular users if it wants to thrive and survive." That is totally and completely defeatist. Bitcoin - the solution to the banking problem - can't survive without banking relationships? Are you serious?
"Mass growth," again, comes when it is impossible to ignore because it is the global 800-pound gorilla in the room.

I can imagine Amazon gift cards serving a function like this, especially with a ready market for them into BTC through Purse.
While you're technically right that you can avoid negative interest rates through any of these options, you're missing the point that using any of these options is less desirable than straight cash. Buying gold (real gold, not paper claims) is very difficult (plus the costs of storing, insuring, assaying, transporting it, etc.). Using gift cards is not ideal as they aren't recognized as legal tender by any government, are not insured, cannot be exchanged in certain countries, etc.
Thankfully not many European banks have incurred negative rates on customer deposits (only some on large institutions), so this risk doesn't truly exist now, but what is frightening is the recognition that the privacy and reliability of all currencies are falling quickly as central bankers try to shut down all possible exit avenues from their monetary circus performance. Cash is anathema to the Keynesian banking system, and they are taking certain steps to eliminate it over time.
@_date: 2016-02-15 18:20:32


Up to certain limits - many European countries don't allow cash purchases over 5,000 or 10,000. I'm also curious to see if the 1000 bill will be halted following the 500 (assuming it hasn't already).


Not possible for lots of people, owing either to no access to crypto markets or they cannot get money out of banks into foreign currencies (Cyprus, Greece at times, etc.)


That's not money - this is like suggesting people buy real estate as an option.


Wal-Mart not as popular in Europe as in USA, also Walmart gift cards are not cash.


True - but it helps to remember this.
You're right that there are somewhat liquid options for financially savvy Europeans, but those don't offer the same liquidity as the 500 note. Halting the production of pure cash is one of the steps governments and central banks will take and have taken to ensure everyone is using state-approved fractional reserve banking channels. They want to prevent "leakages" from the Keynesian, negative-rates nightmare.

Stated purpose: Reduce financial thought crimes like money laundering
(Potential) ulterior motive: Reduce cash use in the general population. Removing certain types of cash makes it harder to avoid negative rates from banks - effectively forcing people to use banks for every transaction.

That's not exactly true. If a State is willing to accept bitcoin for taxes, it implies a certain level of understanding among the politicians and bureaucrats as to "how" this type of thing works. That understanding could - and probably will - be used to further various objectionable laws and edicts down the road, such as requiring citizens to have a publicly-known address for tax purposes, demanding visibility of wallets, etc.
States that have barely heard of Bitcoin or who have no interest in it will be comparatively further behind, and they will more quickly become obsolete in the eyes of a technologically-capable populace.

I agree - but by that time, Bitcoin will be orders of magnitude more valuable for the people who really don't want a p2p, trustless, anonymous, private, anarchist payment network. When that coin comes around that more fully captures the spirit of Satoshi, I'll also dump my holdings of FedCoin or whatever Bitcoin becomes.


Sure, if Bitcoin doesn't scale, it becomes the new way for banks and governments to settle accounts, like gold used to be. I think it should reach more hands than that.


The real issue is not settlement, which I agree is fucked, but by credit bubbles due to ZIRP and money-printing, which Bitcoin also solves neatly.

The price has "tanked" because of China, mining sell-off, worldwide stock crashes, bank news, etc. A million reasons, of which we may only be able to surmise a few. Economics is never that clean where we can isolate all the variables. The price certainly hasn't tanked because some developers can't agree on a technical solution to a future bandwidth problem - very, very few people in the world actually know about this storm in the teapot.

I believe there is a greater difference between anarchists and minarchists than between minarchists and other statists. I have no intention in bringing about some minimal State, governed by magical paper limits.
That said, I don't want to alienate minarchists - just their strategies. We should be encouraging agorism and civil disobedience, not politicking. That's a complete waste of time, whether you want "minimal" government or no government.

I'm not honestly sure. I don't pay state income or sales tax, as none exist, and I am do not bear property tax ransoms directly as I am not a property owner (although I do pay it indirectly through rental rates).
Property taxes are due every year, I believe. I'm not certain they can elect to pay immediately.


Definitely not (as NH doesn't even collect income tax), but there are ways to receive portions of your wage in Bitcoin like with Bitwage.

Well, it's not about what he wants so much as how it is happening. Bitcoin will not take over the world if it is sanitized and becomes a GovCoin or a CorpCoin. Mainstream adoption is worthless, and perhaps harmful, if the real spirit of a decentralized, permissionless, and open ledger is harmed. Satoshi made Bitcoin with the idea it would undermine central banks and governments - not that it would be a better payments rail for buying coffee.
@_date: 2015-09-17 14:24:08
Not sure this is a good idea. I would hate for Bitcoin to be adopted by governments only for it to become a "taxable" "asset" by which the legislature can force people to demonstrate ownership of addresses, keeps a list of addresses/identities, or, even worse, use the success of a Bitcoin program to push for a GovCoin or BankCoin that everyone should use.

Good analysis. This is why mainstream economists fear even a little deflation - it would lead to systemic crises as one business defaults, forcing any others reliant on it to also default, etc. "all the way down." Irving Fisher describes this as "debt-deflation."
There's no easy to unwind this massive credit bubble short of a collapse in the structure of production, but it's worth noting this could never happen with sound money (ie, private production of gold, the use of Bitcoin, or similar).
Guido Hulsmann wrote an excellent monograph on why deflation is WONDERFUL for the average person and horrible for central banks, governments, and indebted corporations. I recommend people read it: 
@_date: 2015-11-13 16:39:16


This is not true. Millions of individual people have financially onboarded to Bitcoin without becoming bank-like institutions. Bitcoin doesn't need Wall St. finance; the reverse is true, and the difficulty of Wall St. onboarding Bitcoin is due to government regulation at various levels - which is probably why Bitcoin will surpass these institutions and, in fact, allow for the creation of decentralized, uncensorable alternatives to typical banks and investment vehicles.
@_date: 2015-11-13 20:23:05
I guess I just don't agree. I don't think it's lunacy to recognize the State is built and sustained by holding certain key monopolistic positions, such as money production, jurisprudence and legislation, dispute resolution, etc. and if those get disrupted by cheaper, decentralized, more empowering alternatives, then it doesn't have much of a leg to stand on.

Holding Bitcoin is doing everything you need to do to "grow the economy." It is a fallacy that consumer spending enhances economic productivity.

This is the critical mistake. The nation-state is not an inevitable social institution, a necessary institution, or even a workable institution. It is a bit like having bullies on the *Lord of the Flies.* It's not inevitable that bullies rule - all the kids could work together voluntarily, trading and exchanging voluntarily, and even forming defensive pacts with each other all without a single monopoly forming.

That's only if you believe the dissemination of correct opinions/thinking is required to end the State; I don't. The ubiquity of decentralizing technology will do that without anyone needing to be convinced. Uber (not the best example, but I'm running with it) is successful because people tried it out and they found it's more to their liking than ossified taxi monopolies. Nobody had to be "convinced" it was going to be better - they experienced it was. The same will happen with Bitcoin and fiat money, and, in the future, crypographically-secured contracts/law over statutory and legislative systems.
This is my speculation and I'm not claiming it's necessarily going to happen a la Hegelian/Marxian thinking. It's a curious possibility that seems to be more plausible the more the technology matures and we have the foresight to imagine future scenarios.

I agree that human relations and humanity in general has a tendency to become hierarchical and all that. I'm not denying the trend towards "leaders" or "bosses" or things like that. I'm talking about a very specific iteration of hierarchy - namely, a violent monopoly that claims 2 things: the power to tax and the power to rule, in essence, the monopoly of theft and of aggression. The nation-state, DEFINED by those terms, is threatened by the existence of "flattening," decentralizing technology, whereas leaders and such are not. There can be many leaders in a polycentric world, but none of them have a monopoly on their leadership.

There is actually no conflict with the existence of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and Mises' regression theorem.

This doesn't make sense to me at all. I have no idea what you're talking about. How can individuals committed to a crypto-revolution possibly gain by talking to the government? VC-backed companies, public organizations, okay I get it. Discussions of the nature: "please don't send us to jail" are important for those involved. Beyond that, I see no way the goals of Satoshi are advanced one tiny iota by proactively seeking regulators or their involvement.
Uber is a centralized, for-profit service. It's tactics are suitable to its goals. Bitcoin is cryptographic money, blueprints for a peer-to-peer revolution. The goals are very different, the tactics should be as well.

Perhaps it is wise, perhaps not. Satoshi seemed to hold some libertarian ideas, and it's possible he wanted others to carry the ideas further.

When you spend bitcoin, you are 99% of the time spending it with a merchant who will use an intermediary like BitPay who sells it on an exchange for cash. That is sending a sell signal to the market, lowering the price.
In the other 1% of the time when you spend bitcoin with a merchant who keeps it, you are satisfying his demand for bitcoin which otherwise would have been expressed as buy order on the exchanges, preventing a growing of the price.
Acquiring and spending bitcoin is the same as buying and selling bitcoin; you are sending mixed signals.

Impersonating me is not theft. There's no threat or application of force.


A credit card number is a feature of trust-based system. I have a credit card number from an agency who credits me money instantly at the time of purchase according to certain limits, and I repay them later according to certain limits. Every use of that credit card is believed by both merchants and the CC agency to have originated from me. By using my CC number without my knowledge or permission, you are impersonating me and gaining goods/services off of my reputation and creditworthiness. Now, I don't own my reputation or creditworthiness, but they are things I cultivate nonetheless. By using my CC, you are violating my dignity (by damaging something I am actively cultivating about my character) and you are not respecting the credit card agency (by falsifying their identification system) nor the merchant (who has his/her own desire to conduct commerce with legitimate customers). I would consider those moral infractions.


The only more I consider acceptable to enforce is the institution of private property - both in one's body and in one's property (justly acquired possessions). If you want to enforce some other more on people, I will disagree with it.


I don't have any desire to do this. I'm just having a conversation with you.


Well, it's up for debate whether what he did was illegal (after all, this is why appeals courts exist), but I will admit that him getting owned was by the legal system.

As we discussed earlier, law is derivative of ethics. I'm asking you an ethical question, and your response is to summon the law.
Let me try again: On what ethical basis do you consider the entire body of intellectual property law to be legitimate?


If this were 1850, and I were asking you a question regarding the ethics of slavery, would you point to the existence of slave-catchers as a reason for supporting the existence of that institution? Probably not, given contemporary sensibilities.
 &gt; Conversely, what, other than your constantly-shifting (the good has to be "rivalrous" now?) definition, makes you believe that I can't?
The definition doesn't shift; simply the angle and words used. If you don't recognize an elephant by the tusks, maybe I can demonstrate it to you by its trunk.
[Rivalry]( and scarcity go together. It's because things are scarce that they can invite rival uses, and there is thus a need to arbitrate between these uses. If I have a carrot and give it to you, I no longer have it (but now I have the virtue of charity, which is MUCH more nutritious!). If I have an mp3, on the other hand, I can copy it infinitely and give you at least one if not more copies without losing it myself. In economics this is rivalrousness. Certain goods are not rivalrous (some suggest national defense is an example: my "consumption" of national defense doesn't preclude you from consuming it at the same time). Almost all digital goods are not scarce, and therefore non-rivalrous (the only exceptions I can think of right now are domain names, Bitcoin units, and other digital goods that are made deliberately scarce).
If a good is not rivalrous, if it cannot be contested by rival uses, therefore there is no need to assign ownership to it as ownership is only a mechanism to arbitrate between incompatible, rivalrous uses of a good.

@_date: 2016-07-22 17:00:09


Let me flesh it out for you in the form of a syllogism:
1. Ownership of goods is dependent on those goods being scarce.
2. Certain goods are not scarce.
3. Therefore, certain goods cannot be owned.


Yes, that is the opposing viewpoint. Justice, in my understanding, is an intersubjective concept and it applies to all universally. It is basically a logical discipline, and hence opposing views on justice cannot both be true. I understand reasonable philosophers disagree with this conception, and that's fine.




That's not what I'm saying. You're caught up in what's "OK" or what's "fine" to do. I don't argue with those terms. All I am positing is that violating a TOS - specifically with regards to handling intellectual property - is not theft. It's disrespectful, and risky, and probably stupid depending on the context, but none of that allows the action to rise to the category of theft.

iTunes doesn't own the underlying information pattern of music to begin with (because, as above, you can't own non-scarce goods), so it's hard to see how they can impose legitimate restrictions on others regarding the modification or dissemination of this information. Most people follow the iTunes TOS because they don't want to lose convenient access to the storehouse of music iTunes has elegantly crafted for them, not out of any moral notions of what is or isn't theft. It's the same with Steam. I follow their TOS because I love how they deliver and curate content for me - but I don't actually believe they "own" the games they distribute.


Then why did you just bring up your feelings if you don't want to get into it?
The law is an official channel for the exercise of justice - that's all it's ever been historically. Unjust laws are no law at all, and this sentiment has been accepted in many traditions: common and customary law systems, natural law systems, etc. Discussing perversions - such as the law punishing an innocent person - seems rather appropriate for this conversation.
Why do you "feel" the law is just, and why do you feel it delivers just punishments (Two questions here)? I mean, I could rattle off a number of highly questionable legal constructions (say, the War on Drugs) with themselves highly questionable punishments. Do you feel that someone going to jail for years because they owned a plant is just?


Sure I have. A TOS is a type of contract, and legitimate contracts should be followed. However, a contract that specified squared circles or other logical impossibilities (such as assigning rights over a good not owned by either party) is not a legitimate contract, and adherence to that contract is determined by prudential reasons, not categorically moral reasons.

A particular law's existence is not simultaneous with its justification for existence. You can't cite its existence as a justification.


I understand that perspective, but gain or loss should be an irrelevant criteria when it comes to justice. The law shouldn't favor particular industries at the expense of others, or certain producers at the expense of others, but intellectual property does both of those. If enacting justice would mean collapsing the gains you "deserved," then your current business model is predicated on coercion. Some artists, thankfully, are embracing file sharing world and will end up creating new business models that continue to allow artists to earn rewards from their work, but in ways that don't use force to prevent access.


How does this make sense to you?
Why would you assume how I feel?
Your whole manner of thinking in this, about who "deserves" the gain, is a little warped. It's not a manner of deserts. The gains aren't even guaranteed! You could spend a billion dollars on something and not return a cent on it. Instead of focusing on whom should claim a potential return on investment, the question hinges more fundamentally regarding the use of force. Copying information is not force, it's a peaceful act; but enforcing victimless crime laws is not a peaceful act, it's aggression. It's introducing an injustice to guarantee some kind of monopoly privilege (which is historically what patents and such have been: privileges granted by a sovereign) at the expense of would-be inventors/artists and all the consumers who now have to pay a not insignificant price for what is essentially infinitely replicable and should therefore be hardly more expensive than free.

Correct, you can't steal it. Simply you knowing what numbers conform to my credit card account doesn't matter at all. Now, if you or someone else try to purchase things with it, you will be impersonating me, and defrauding both the merchant and the credit card company who are only assisting you because they believe you are me. That is an example of fraud.

What - besides your predisposition to already believe you can own information - makes this seem implausible? Why do you think you can own, and thereby justly exclude others, from goods which are not rivalrous?


I've never denied that implementations of justice (law) are culturally-bound. What I posit is that justice per se is not culturally-bound.


Your constant references to the most popular source of information on the internet is a little insulting, frankly. I'm familiar with what wikipedia has to say on justice. I'm also familiar with what Plato, Hume, Kant, Rawls, and others have to say on justice.


I'm not particularly concerned with what it's called. Theft is, to me, by definition, an injustice. "Whatever you want to call this situation," to me, is neither theft nor an injustice. 


I would disagree with this assessment. I would consider the theft to be an injustice, despite the virtue she acquired by feeding her child.


Candy bars are rivalrous; if I take it, the store doesn't have it. Copies of Windows OS are not like this.


See above.


I'm not sure why you feel that's untenable, but ok.


What I'm driving at is the idea that intellectual "property" is a misnomer and doesn't exist. Information is not scarce and therefore can't be owned. If someone copies information, that's not an injustice, while it might be disrespectful, risky, stupid, dangerous, mean, insulting, imprudent, whatever. None of these constitute an injustice - and to put a man in prison for not committing an injustice is itself an injustice. That's been my perspective this entire dialogue.
Now, my personal opinion is that violating copyright laws is probably - unless you are a crypto expert like Ed Snowden or whatever - imprudent and dangerous, so I don't *recommend* anyone to do it - but I will also not disavow anyone who does. They're taking a great risk, but they aren't doing something I would consider "wrong" (so to speak).

It's not difficult to predict if you've studied economics or monetary theory in particular. Full reserve banking is not a theoretically or empirical oddity, and your repeated aspersions to it as "untested" is simply irrelevant. Studying the multi level effects of fractional reserve banking is the difficult question. I think you have them reversed. We have had a hundred years of fractional reserve fiat banking backstopped by powerful central banks utilizing the latest econometric data to stabilize the economy and ...we have worldwide economic meltdowns and world wars. So I think a world of fractional reserve banks with or without central banks is the more complex creature.
Yes, you're probably right. It would initially slow the adoption of Bitcoin. If I'm right, a full reserve system for Bitcoins would be highly profitably and attractive, and would win over adherents on its own merits thus rendering that problem smaller and smaller.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:53:03
Well, there's no need to refer to it as "mattresses." Full reserve banking is the historical norm until the emergence of state-sanctioned fiat currency in the last few centuries. And then you say it's untested and "complicated." You must be confused. Let me help.
Full reserve banking has two sides. On the one hand, some banks will perform a storage function for clients and allow immediate "demand deposits" (like today). Every cent of your deposits would be sitting in a safe for any time you want it, even during economic depressions. Banks runs are impossible. Banks would earn a profit by charging prices for storage and security and benefiting from economies of scale. On the other hand, they will also perform an intermediary role. They will collect funds from savers and lend them to borrows for a small interest differential (of which you earn some). You earn interest for depositing money in "time deposits" because you surrender your claim to its liquidity. When you contract to save your money with a bank, you don't keep access to it. This is not uncommon and easily a plausible form of banking.
I think you're right about the consequences of this idea, though. The switch to Bitcoin will be fundamental to our understanding of monetary theory and so forth, but I'm also excited to see its literal effect on banking and finance in the present time. If Bitcoin rises in value and becomes more mainstream in five years, I would be interested to see how banks react.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:25:14
Who's suggesting not using banks? I just said they would be valuable for two (2) reasons: warehousing (potentially) and lending. But it would be BAD to mix those functions into one banking procedure based on fractional reserves. Bitcoin banking, if not much different than typical banking, would operate best under full reserves. I don't understand why you invoke mattresses.
Credit would certainly be scarcer and interest rates on loans higher in a full reserve banking system. But that's the point. Loose credit and easy money creates bubbles in the first place.
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:40:41
Buying bitcoin is obviously sending a buy signal. But spending it with any mainstream merchant is essentially selling it on the exchanges because most merchants need to convert it to fiat to pay their bills. 
If they don't convert it to fiat, then you are satisfying what would have been them buying from an exchange - so you are negating the conterfactual buy signal.
By all means, spend your digital money however you want, but just know you are exerting a downward effect on price when you do.

The response to that point - which is true as it stands, I absolutely agree with you - is to make the case that the only reason people voluntarily choose these sweatshop conditions are because their range of alternative employment methods are being suppressed, usually by their own government in the interest of foreign capital investors. Their own governments throw make it impossible to save money (they inflate it), to own property (they control the land title business), to start their own business (by making it expensive through legislation), etc etc.
Maybe sweatshops are a lot of people's best choice - but it's hardly a free market outcome.

Fractional reserve banking, or more specifically the creation of unbacked notes, causes business cycles. It would not be a boon for bitcoin to have "banks" operate under fractional reserves, because this can engender investment swings and bank runs as you aptly described.
If Bitcoin profits from traditional methods of banking, then it would be best to operate it under a principle of full reserves. The demand deposits would not earn one interest, true; but banks also perform an intermediary function as well, and any customer could choose to save his money - literally surrendering ownership of it to the bank for X period of time - for the principal and interest at the end. Fractional reserve banking tries to have it both ways - immediately redeemable checkable deposits and interest returns on those. It can't do that without eventually leading to an economic crisis.

An incredibly small fraction of laws conform to justice; 99% of laws violate people's natural rights.


The definition I'm using roughly conforms to "gaining by force or threat." Digital goods aren't scarce, so I'm not taking anything from you by copying them. If I don't deprive you of what's taken, it can't be theft.


I wouldn't admit you're not doing anything wrong, but technically these examples constitute fraud, not theft.

That's what makes it theft. People only consent to taxation/theft under threat of violence.
@_date: 2013-05-25 20:11:21
Taxation is a type of theft because it is a type of involuntary transfer of property. The government sends its agents out who then threaten the rest of society to surrender a portion of their earnings to government. If they resist, they are punished. But at no time did all or dare I say any of those citizens "agree" in any meaningful contractually legitimate sense to that exchange. So that makes the state (a group of people) a criminal organization who routinely thieve from the class of tax-payers.
From Spooner's *Constitution of No Authority*:
"The proceedings of those robbers and murderers, who call themselves "the government," are directly the opposite of these of the single highwayman.
In the first place, they do not, like him, make themselves individually known; or, consequently, take upon themselves personally the responsibility of their acts. On the contrary, they secretly (by secret ballot) designate some one of their number to commit the robbery in their behalf, while they keep themselves practically concealed. They say to the person thus designated:
Go to A_____ B_____, and say to him that "the government" has need of money to meet the expenses of protecting him and his property. If he presumes to say that he has never contracted with us to protect him, and that he wants none of our protection, say to him that that is our business, and not his; that we choose to protect him, whether he desires us to do so or not; and that we demand pay, too, for protecting him. If he dares to inquire who the individuals are, who have thus taken upon themselves the title of "the government," and who assume to protect him, and demand payment of him, without his having ever made any contract with them, say to him that that, too, is our business, and not his; that we do not choose to make ourselves individually known to him; that we have secretly (by secret ballot) appointed you our agent to give him notice of our demands, and, if he complies with them, to give him, in our name, a receipt that will protect him against any similar demand for the present year. If he refuses to comply, seize and sell enough of his property to pay not only our demands, but all your own expenses and trouble beside. If he resists the seizure of his property, call upon the bystanders to help you (doubtless some of them will prove to be members of our band.) If, in defending his property, he should kill any of our band who are assisting you, capture him at all hazards; charge him (in one of our courts) with murder; convict him, and hang him. If he should call upon his neighbors, or any others who, like him, may be disposed to resist our demands, and they should come in large numbers to his assistance, cry out that they are all rebels and traitors; that "our country" is in danger; call upon the commander of our hired murderers; tell him to quell the rebellion and "save the country," cost what it may. Tell him to kill all who resist, though they should be hundreds of thousands; and thus strike terror into all others similarly disposed. See that the work of murder is thoroughly done; that we may have no further trouble of this kind hereafter. When these traitors shall have thus been taught our strength and our determination, they will be good loyal citizens for many years, and pay their taxes without a why or a wherefore.
It is under such compulsion as this that taxes, so called, are paid. And how much proof the payment of taxes affords, that the people consent to "support the government," it needs no further argument to show."

Do you bring proof, or only opinions? I don't assert it disappeared; it was never true in the first place. There is NO trade-off between inflation and unemployment. What does happen, and to the myopic appears like a vindication of the Phillips Curve, is that when new money is created and and penetrates the market, entrepreneurs and capitalists will be the first to receive it. This will temporarily raise their purchasing power relative to the price of labor, and will allow them to hire more labor at the current wage. This is what proponents of the Phillips Curve point to. Eventually, however, the newly inflated money does end up in the hands of laborers in the form of higher nominal wages. This long run assessment of the effects of inflation on employment was shown by Friedman. In the long run, wage rates adjust to inflation and whatever extra-hiring capacity the inflation spurred is now dampened. Greece and Spain have chronically high unemployment records because of the wide-reaching labor laws the Spanish and Greek governments have legislated, and because of the extraordinary expense of financing their bloated welfare states. It has nothing to do with inflation.
The living standards between the years 1870 and 1893 rose higher than any other period in American history. Please acquaint yourself:

A Bitcoin economy would experience secular deflation (deflation that is caused by an increase in goods and services relative to the amount of money) over time, and lenders would take this into account when computing interest rates. Just as we have inflation today, deflation premiums will be built into contracts. This general deflation will encourage people to become more forward-oriented and save, thus creating longer investment projects and more efficient production processes. Interest rates would be high, marginal entrepreneurs would be driven out of the market, and capital would be bought by those who command a higher skill at predicting their customers' desires.
It would also eliminate the whole web of financial sorcery that is required in today's world simply to retire. The gold standard - also a deflationary money - allowed people to simply hoard their currency until they were old and needed it to survive, and as it would continually appreciate, this was a common strategy. Inflation makes that impossible today. Holding on to cash for a retirement is the worst choice. This forces those living on fixed incomes and savings to gamble in the stock market, in mutual funds, in CDs in banks, etc. This produces a lot more financial uncertainty and complexity that need exist. Bitcoin would solve this as well.

Everyone please note that my respondent did not address the central Spoonerian point I made above: that taxation *qua* involuntary levy is a form of theft and is therefore morally repugnant. He neither concedes it nor challenges it. Unless he decides to come back to this, I will consider that point standing strong.
To the points you (AllNaturalX) do make, I have a few responses:


You recognize that this still leaves unasked the question of whether taxation is morally acceptable and truly any different from theft. It's true that if I don't pay taxes, I lose access to government services. So?  What's your point? That's not relevant to the question of the injustice of taxation.


I hardly have a choice in "reaping government benefits" considering they outlaw competition in most of the "benefits" they provide. That being said, it was also true that calling for the abolition of slavery was unpalatable to the masses of the American public 200 years ago.


Where are the grounds for this claim? There aren't any currently existing "free market dominated societies" to look to for this; unless you're making a more theoretical claim that free markets necessarily lack the ability to create these services (which is tantamount to saying they can't be provided contractually, only forcibly). I don't agree with this. I think a free market dominated society - where state intervention at all or most levels was eliminated - could easily satisfy the creation of those services, even unbiased controversial scientific research.


No one said the state can't do good things. Only that its financing necessarily relies on aggression and intimidation. A thief can certainly use his money to improve people's lives - that doesn't make him not a thief, though.


The market isn't anyone's friend, and neither does it have "entities". A market is just a network of people. Secondly, the state is also not necessarily to ensure product regulation. In fact, appointing a monopoly organization to "regulate" consumer products is arguably the worst idea because that very organization can be bought or corrupted. Markets self-regulate because there is an incentive for people to expose scams or unsafe products.


That's not true. The state commits the theft when it takes my assets against my will. Avoiding taxes is thus equivalent to avoiding theft or embezzlement. I'm sorry that is depriving the government of money for it to do things you apparently enjoy, but you have no right to claim money from other people.
