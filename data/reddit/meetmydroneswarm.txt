I wouldn't at all expect all traders and small mining ops to pay taxes..  That is more of a true necessity for high-volume traders and (even more so) for businesses.  
If you're a trader and make $50K off Bitcoin one year and you don't report it, the IRS might find you.  Might.  Eventually.  If they care enough.
If you're a business though making idk over $500K in revenue annually off crypto mining or investing or lending or whatever, and you're re-investing that money back into your business- as you will want to do- your accountant will probably advice you to report your crypto gains.  Otherwise an audit would show huge inconsistencies, and the crypto industry in the US is gonna be under a lot of scrutiny in the coming years.. legit crypto businesses that want to stay alive should take a compliance-first approach
The bigger your business, the harder it is to just say "I don't know shit bout no crypto" when filing your taxes

Yes, the sweet spot would be those businesses that are large enough to be profitable but not large enough to have their own IT and accounting departments
I'm writing an algorithm to find the optimal way to calculate taxes given the specific trades made by an individual.. For each crypto transaction, a USD value needs to be determined for the amount of crypto bought or sold, and the IRS does not give many guidelines here, just that the method of calculation must be consistent for each individual.. not consistent for all our clients, just consistent for each individual client.. 
Considering there are dozens of exchanges that could potentially be used to determine the cost basis for the USD conversions, and daily Open High Low Close values can vary by like 20% from exchange to exchange, then selecting the optimal exchanges to use for calculating the cost basis for each token that an individual bought or sold can save that individual up to 20% on their tax liability.  If this is correct, and I believe it is because I've found no evidence to the contrary, I'm surprised more people aren't talking about it..

Is that the fair market value?  Are you using it to hold your hardware bitcoin wallets?

It's an established term, I didn't make it up.

Just saying..
Give a man a gun he can rob a bank. 
Give a man a bank he can rob the world. 
(Mr Robot). 
Give a “Japanese guy” a computer and he makes an algorithm and financial system that cannot be destroyed and survives on its own in the wild and makes the banking industry nervous..
 
And who’s the smartest one in the room then, the one with the gun, the one with the bank, or the one with the algorithm?

You’re right, I had “iRobot” as the quote reference instead of “Mr Robot”. Oh my, that is dumb 
As for the rest of my post, I’d say a rhetorical question is only as dumb as the person reading it

I think the fact that Bitcoin can be referred to as some programmer’s passion project shows it’s already won. 
When’s the last time your passion project reached a global market cap of $250B?
