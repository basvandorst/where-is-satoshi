I'm just here to tell you all how much I don't care and that you remarking on my investment that I bragged about hurts my feelings which I don't have.

No. That's not the gentlemanly manner of bitcoin investors I know!

Oh. Well then I better not. Thanks!

Well not regulating the banks worked out so well. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:45:58
The difference is USD is used for a ton of legal things. Bitcoin is 1% illegal, 98% nothing, 1% weird but legal stuff.

I'm confused. Can't you believe in the long term success of this and believe that it's value will flatten or go down?

Darn tough.


You seem to think that past performance by Microsoft has some bearing on future performance, which is A) idiotic even if it weren't B) irrelevant to my point.
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:50:35
Even if this happens, it only works if you sell at the right time. And judging from this forum, people didn't know to do that (and are constantly encouraged not to).
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:31:21
It's also not how Bitcoin is going. The top of the loops are getting lower, not higher. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:26:39


You sir are the perfect Bitcoin investor. 


I am speechless.

If you don't believe that you know better than other people you wouldn't be investing in bitcoin though, right? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:32:56
I hear a lot of people saying this, but it always strikes me as strange. Why would you put your long term investment money into something as volatile and uncertain as Bitcoin? Index funds are extremely stable and basically double your money every decade with an almost 0% chance of losing all your money. 
Do you know what you mean by long term? Are you selling at a time or a price? What is your investment goal?
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:42:41


Fun fact of investing. You are only up if you sell.

@_date: 2018-02-02 12:24:44
This is no place for your reasonable thinking. Everyone here starts with the assumption that Bitcoin will go up forever, so selling at any point is not acceptable. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:12:40
Using past performance to predict future gains is the way you get suckers on the line.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:55:10


OR if it goes to zero. But my point is everyone around here applies this logic to losses but not to gains.


This is 100% true, and one of the reasons people generally invest in stable steady growth. Investing in extremely volatile risky sectors isn't a good way to ever have a clear picture of your net worth.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:55:22
Because if you think you are correct, you are costing yourself a ton of money?
