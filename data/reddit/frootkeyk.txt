I'd take it right away, because 95% of taxes we pay are going to overblown government where 60-70% work in public sector and got their jobs by being member and/or supporting party in power. Parties change but the system stays the same. Why would I care? I see generations getting old trying to change that without any success while majority sells their vote for peanuts. Screw them. I've no respect whatsoever for petty souls trying to screw everyone for free ride.

I'm thinking, how the hell do you convert that kind of money to fiat.

I'm into bitcoin since recently and invested a bit because why not. I'm totally aware how much i don't know about this topic and people shouting around with their predictions is not helping. That's why I'm reading "mastering bitcoin", as an idea to inform myself on the topic and start contributing with code hopefully.

We're going down! down down down down down.

No, you have to wait. As far as I know maximum amount of time transaction can wait is 2 weeks unless specified otherwise, but I'm just a noob here so someone else might chime in.

In contrast to dollar which is backed by ...

So mempool is up to 100k again. Will it start to climb again?

People will start using it as currency once it's widely adopted and less volatile and LN or something similar solves transaction issues. In the mean time, we need to wait for everyone to get onboard and that means rise in value.

So it's backed by trust. Who says any other currency can't do the same. Bitcoin looks like nice choice since it's not controlled by any govt and masses are adopting it to some extent. The point being USD is as virtual as cryptocurrency is.

If you see the transaction in the receiving wallet as unconfirmed that means it still isn't verified. Depending on your sending setup it could either take up to 14 days for it to get verified or return to sender. The fact thar you can see it in destination wallet means everything is ok, it's not lost. Take your time to familiarize yourself with how transactions work with bitcoin.

My thinking was it would be easier to hodl if I know there is nothing to lose from this complete ride. Getting back what I invested and than continuing sounds like reasonable thing.

I never used exchanges to store my coins but shouldnt that be very easy to do by getting new wallet, generating new address and transfering to it?
Of course you'll have to wait few days for transaction to settle with mempool being huge as it is now. Im amazed how people are too lazy or just incapable reading few pages.

Just admit to yourself that you have a gambling problem, because that's what it is.

Bought 1 BTC at 10.5k, im holding it until it's either 21k or 0. Anything inbetween is non of my concern. At 21k I might sell 0.5 to return investment. What you guys think.

RemindMe! to look back on this 11 months from now!
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:40:36
Yeah, and now try to scale it to support thousands of requests per minute.
@_date: 2018-06-04 18:26:43
You've no idea what you are talking about, do you?
@_date: 2018-07-06 18:57:07
I'm sorry, but what you are advocating here is sci-fi at the moment. It might be the case in the future but now it's far far from being currency you are describing.
I get what you guys are talking about, blockchain is going to be important in the future as a technology, but for me bitcoin at the moment is just lottery I was willing to bet on with a small amount I don't mind losing.
Oh, and thanks to pioneers pushing this forward.

You are aware that that's never going to happen right? Country without power to control and monitor money and wealth transactions is powerless.
