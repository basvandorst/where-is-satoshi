Site looks good. I tried it on my smartphone and no issues with presentation. Looking good.

Which I don't understand for an 'offline' messaging app. It isn't pretty but it works, that's why I use Serval Mesh. It is open sourced and truly offline. You can even share the app to others within the app offline. It was taken down from Google play store because they intentionally support older versions of Android OS.

Not sure. But I can imagine Google will claim due to security. In the meantime, my personal opinion is planned obsolescence. The money machine has to keep on turning.

I too just started. I tried once before during the Occupy Wallstreet movement. At the time I wanted myself and others to trade among ourselves and by pass the corporations. I found bitcoin. I tried mining but it was to complicated for me. I ran the script on my pc for a week. Not even sure if I got anything from it. Fast forward today, much easier with smartphones and wallets provided by coinbase or circle. I have still much to learn. At the present time I don't like the fact to link my account to coinbase. So I found sites that give free bits. I am up to 10 bits so far. LOL. This is the future.
