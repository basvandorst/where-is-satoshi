That's why we use Linux :)

I was taking about trust and not about security or vulnerabilities. You can tell if you follow the thread.

1. Doesn't bother you that there is nothing democratic in the decision making of a central bank?
2. When a county needs money, the central bank doesn't only create the money. In addition in creates debt.
3. The same applies for private banks and loans. Right now, around 95% of the money supply is "debt money". Add interest to this and you understand why the momentary ratio between debt and money is around 20:9 (mind the order).

Inflation is defined by effect not its cause. The effect is the actual amount of BTC you pay for certain goods. You assume that because presently, new BTCs are created, BTC has to be inflationary. This might be theoretically a cause for inflation, but right now the value of BTC is rising which makes BTC deflationary by definition. If BTC will be generally adopted this will certainly change and it's value will rise or fall depending on the market situation.. with a slight tendency for inflation as long as new BTCs are created.

Actually, BTC is only now deflationary. It will change its value depending on market situation. Regarding businesses going bankrupt because of this, I honestly think this is quite healthy. Right now, we are wasting so much for the sake of producing money alone. Businesses that sell things that we truly need will always be good and since people can buy and hold BTC they are safe in this process. Assuming BTC gets generally adopted, it will be deflationary only as long as the economy growths.

I am not. I was trying point at the difference between value and supply and that the definition of inflation/deflation is based on value and not supply.

Microsoft needs to embrace Linux in order to remain relevant. Why didn't you mention the fact, that Windows is not open source. Why trusting Microsoft that their OS is doing what they say it does perfectly well knowing, that all they want is our money and data. Isn't trust the main reason for using bitcoin? Don't you think it's at least problematic to defend a ~90%monopoly run by a notorious and convicted monopolist?

Microsoft is a corporation which is legally a person, no matter who is it's CEO. As such I am looking at it, trying to understand it's goals and it's strategies to achieve them. I don't see monopoly, nor a hidden agenda (possible thought proprietary software) and especially not the combination of both as something desirable. This is why I'm using a Linux based OS and prefer open source software. Does this sound reasonable?

How boring ;)

You are right that BTC cannot replace fiat entirely.. but crypto will. BTC will be simply the safest way to store value. The inflation necessary for growth will come from new coins created for special purposes. You can see it already happening. The difference will be, that we will not be forced to grow economically in order to satisfy our intrinsically inflationary financial system.

Bought my laptop with BTC last month from here  It felt great, even if I would have paid 40% 2 months earlier. It also came without Windows, so no 100€ Microsoft tax. :)
BTW: This is what you pay when you get your laptop preinstalled with Windows Pro.. and 50€ for Home edition.
