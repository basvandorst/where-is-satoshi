What is it with Bitcoiners and their complete lack of common sense. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 21:44:47
Sorry to say it but you're pathetic. You're so emotionally (and probably financially) invested you can't even admit the obvious. It's just sad to watch. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:24:45
Your scam is so incredibly dumb. Are you 14 or something?
@_date: 2015-05-30 08:45:16
Or the part where Ross/his lawyers admitted the murder for hire thing and called it "role playing". 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:57:59
It's crazy how this is downvoted. This place is insane. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 09:11:24
"I'm sorry for your loss"
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:47:56
He tried to have 6 people killed including some innocent roommates. Please just stop man. It makes me sick watching this sub downplaying or straight up ignoring this part of the story. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:50:57
I promise you nobody will care and it will fail. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:29:53
Well done. You now enabled 20 more scams. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 19:18:11
Well, it all depends if you want to do it the right way or if you want to support massive cc fraud. Looks like you made your choice. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 07:25:29
Lose. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 19:55:28
And obviously you also aren't insured when you get your shit hacked or if a company you buy from defrauds you. No way to chargeback. 
That's why i always use my cc. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 07:50:45
After all this crap in the past i'm sure nobody is stupid enough to keep their coins there. Or use them at all actually. You have to be a real slow learner if you still use them. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:10:04
They bought it from silk road but it's completely irrelevant to silk road? Uh what?
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:50:15
It Bitcoin fantasy land everything will be magically fixed in the future. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 19:41:06
Good luck getting your money back when your coins get stolen or when you're defrauded. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:34:35
You got it all figured out!
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:37:04
Then put that in title instead of idiotic statements. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 20:21:24
My god...
@_date: 2015-05-30 07:30:05
6 actually. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 11:53:24
Dude, people just want to post and upvote and downvote. It won't work, believe me. You'll probably find half a dozen cultists who post 1 or 2 things and that's it. 
It's exactly the same reason why the world out there doesn't use Bitcoin. They just want to pull their cc and pay. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 22:48:20
You're not seriously asking this?
@_date: 2015-05-28 19:46:14
What could possibly go wrong then. 
Could luck with the switch. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:31:02
Indeed. As long as it's illegal and innocent people get defrauded Bitcoin is the way to go. Bitcoin is superior in those cases. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 08:32:27
This should be on top of the thread instead. But for obvious reasons it's not. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:40:36
He also tried to have people killed. Ffs, please stop ignoring that part!
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:58:51
No they weren't! Ffs! Can you people just stop making up stupid shit?
Edit. Why the hell does my comment get downvoted? Do you people really just downvote anything you don't want to hear?
@_date: 2015-05-28 21:32:59
It's amazing how you completely change the subject as long as you can make it look like fraud is not possible with Bitcoin. 
Let's start again. 


Would you expect fraud when using Bitcoin, yes or no?
Please no wall of text and playing with words like your buddy above. Just answer the very simple question. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:49:02
Yes we know. 20 people before you posted it. Please...
@_date: 2015-05-28 20:09:36
Don't be ridiculous. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 19:10:59
You act like he has a shitload of donated money to fix things. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 18:47:20
Right. I've been seeing these kind of posts for 2 years now. If this was real there would be millions of places to buy Bitcoin by now. Literally on every street corner. Yet everyone struggles to buy coins. Something doesn't add up. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:39:01
Just by the way you type i can already guarantee you it will fail. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 21:41:28
He simply doesn't want to see it. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:49:05
We're talking about consumers buykng things you prick. And that takes seconds with a cc. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 21:11:33
So with Bitcoin it's possible to never ever expect any fraud? Is this seriously what you are saying?
@_date: 2015-05-29 14:09:19
I'm sorry for your loss. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 20:44:29
Ok, you want to play the words game. 
Should Bitcoiners expect fraud, yes or no?
@_date: 2015-05-30 10:55:55
No. It wouldn't. Don't be ridiculous. It would take seconds. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 19:52:53
Which get bought with stolen cc's. But you don't want to know it anyway so i won't bother explaining it to you. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 08:34:38
Don't be ridiculous. Apple Pay is way ahead of Bitcoin when it comes to this. Way! Not even comparable. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 20:18:30
And with Bitcoin you don't expect fraud?
Am i seriously being downvoted for asking this question??
@_date: 2015-05-28 23:10:51
Yes i could but any person above 8 with an IQ above 70 could come up with a reason. So i'm not gonna bother. 
Again: use some common sense. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:57:15
Yes he did and he called it "role playing". Stop pulling shit out of your ass just because he is your druggie hero. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 21:52:28
Just like the early internet. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 22:53:21
Yeah well, what else do you expect when you ask completely ridiculous things. Use some common sense. I can come up with 50 good reasons why they wouldn't do that. I'm sure you can come up with at least 5 then. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 22:21:20
We got it the first 25 times it was posted. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 08:31:23
Many porn sites including Chaturbate added Bitcoin options. Guess what. Nobody used it and now they're removing it again. 
Online it isn't any different than the brick and mortar stores.
