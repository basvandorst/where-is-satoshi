Exactly. In my opinion, encouraging them to look into/learn about bitcoin is the way to go. Then they can make their own informed decision on whether or not bitcoin is something they'd be interested in using. I'm all for spreading the word, but I think too many people are focused on convincing their non\-tech savvy friends and family to buy into bitcoin as some kind of get\-rich\-quick scheme.

Coinbase is pretty much it.

Never store bitcoin in a web wallet. Figuring out how to safely store your own really isn't that hard these days.

This is absolutely and provably false. He actually said the exact opposite, on bitcointalk. Quote with source link below:

You can downvote me if you want, but the fact is, your claim that "Satoshi's plan for Bitcoin was for everyone to run a full node." is provably false.
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:17:43
I stopped telling people they should buy bitcoin in 2013. It's not worth the headache, and if they are truly interested, they'll ask.
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:16:13
Well, that depends on you, but I will say that exchange hacks are not uncommon.
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:13:05
Yes. Anyone with those 24 words can restore your wallet and empty it's contents.
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:57:03
Thanks for the clarification. My main point was that there are no "frozen legacy blocks", other than the initial coins mined in the genesis block,   if you can even consider that a "frozen legacy block".
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:26:16
The Ledger Nano S is a popular and reasonably priced hardware wallet. If you weren't ready to jump in to a hardware wallet, you might want to try a lightweight HD wallet like electrum (desktop) or mycelium (mobile). These days there are enough options out there 
that it's really up to you. But in regards to your original question, I think holding your own coin is a far better option than leaving it on an exchange.
@_date: 2018-05-09 16:27:27
Blockchain.info is absolutely not an option. Never use web wallets. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:56:50
The first mined block is unspendable. To my knowledge, all coins mined after that are still fully usable. He/she/they could move some coin, or simply sign a message using a key from an address known to be associated with satoshi to prove his/her/their identity.
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:15:07
It's far safer, in my opinion, to secure your own coins than to leave them in an exchange and hope they don't get hacked.
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:11:11
Don't store your seed in an e-mail account. Write them down twice and keep them in separate safe places.

I've used several antminer and spondoolies machines in my apartment, unless you like living in an airplane hanger with a jet engine constantly running, I advise against this.

I made this one, I'd be glad to make you a custom listing on ebay. I can do them for $4 + shipping. PM me if you're interested. 
EDIT: I suppose I could try to set up an OpenBazaar shop if you would rather buy using bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:17:35
I'm pretty sure coins sent to 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE are definitely burnt.

Satoshi dumping his BCH on an exchange would also mean revealing his identity. In my opinion, the coins known to belong to Satoshi will likely never move.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:12:49
That's an interesting thought. I suppose if he used Shapeshift to dump his BCH into Monero over Tor, he could potentially get to spend some of his vast fortune without exposing his identity.

There is no official way to do this, but you  can enable "other" as a payment option and put in your shop announcement that you accept BTC. There is also an etsy team, I think it's just called "Bitcoin Team" that should be able to help you along. Good Luck!

On a side note, you can probably squeeze some more life out of your laptop by switching to a [lightweight linux distro]( I've been using [lubuntu]( on an old laptop with great success.

The "fair explanation" is that you spent bitcoin that you shouldn't have, and are now asking random people on the internet for help crafting a convincing lie. The best course of action is to come clean and learn your lesson.

Years ago, I heated my apartment with 3 Antminer S1s, more recently I used a couple Spondoolies SP10s. It worked beautifully other than the (very loud and constant) noise.

If nobody has the private keys, then they are lost permanently.

It has nothing to do with hashing power. Depending on the number of inputs/outputs a transaction has, the size in bytes will be different.
@_date: 2018-07-08 18:51:59
pure? 
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:53:19
Bitcoin is up over 600% since this time last year....
@_date: 2018-07-07 14:38:09
Transaction fees are determined by size (in bytes) of the transaction, not the value.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:58:18
But now, it's still up over 600% since this time last year. It doesn't really matter though, because you are clearly only here to shill some shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:21:25
In my opinion, it's a far better option than trusting blockchain.info or any other web wallet for that matter.

I've been seeing these same type of arguments since we were in the single digits. If you think bitcoin will tank, don't hold any. I personally don't think bitcoin is going to "tank" anytime soon.

In every instance, your customers would be better off just buying the bitcoin.

There are quite a few, I like Electrum. It is an easy to set up HD wallet. Just make sure you write down your seed phrase and keep it in a safe place (or two).
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:24:08
You can set your fee manually in Electrum.

I can pay you 3k for 0.36335676 slowly over the course of a year, or pay less than 3k for that same amount right now. And when you factor in difficulty over the year, the actual total received from your "service" would likely be significantly less than 0.36335676.
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:44:02
Insecure is in the name.
@_date: 2018-04-12 21:14:10
The difficulty will almost certainly be much higher by the end of a year contract, and the total received would be far less than .48

It doesn't \*need\* to have a high value, but if it was to become widely used by a majority of the population, the limited nature of it would drive the price way up. Bitcoin worked for me at $10 just as well as it does today. I am not interested in getting rich quick, I am interested in decentralized technologies that make centralized control structures and middlemen obsolete.
