Might be unpopular opinion, but traders and publicity are necessary for mass adoption. There are more people actually using bitcoin for purchases now than ever because of the media coverage and office chatter. People are curious about how to change their standards of living- they may come in to [make or lose] some quick money, but some few stay to dream about the tech and the potential of an unregulated, self-banked economy.
That said, I’m so tired of seeing more memes than discussion. I’m also tired of all price discussion with no substantive debate.

Yeah... all opinions are represented here, but there are certainly trends. Lots of hodl advice on Reddit, often heavy hype and it seems to me that there are more moonboys here than in Telegram and Slack channels. I don’t mean any of that as criticism- reddit is accessible and seems to help develop community.

It might not. We’re crossing back into bear territory.
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:09:08
I think it’s a good idea to sell at the beginning of a bear market... thing is, nobody really knows for sure when the fall will be done. It could go back to strong bull in two days. People that trade back and forth when they get scared it’ll fall or scared it’ll rise mostly just lose money.
For what it’s worth, now that price has broken under $10k, most good TA I’ve read says next real support is $8k-$8.5k

In cryptocurrency? Mostly luck, in my opinion. Trading off big market movements can be a bit more sustainable, but I don’t believe that TA is very reliable in a market with so much manipulation and volatility.

Returns on cryptocurrency investments aren’t guaranteed. If you do make money, then you loose some to the interest on the loan. It’s not a good idea to invest money that you don’t have into a high risk asset class.
That said, YOLO /s

Actually- yeah. The coins are new. Fun thing about bitcoin is that you can look back through the spend history (or lack of history) of coins. The movement of the newly issued coins corresponded to a big, red, 17m candle.

I think the most likely moon scenario for bitcoin is when the public uses bitcoin as a hedge against rampant inflation during a massive international recession.
In a market crash, or a major recession, people will pull money from investments in order to cover expenses- bitcoin included. I imagine that people with extra money to invest will be be making a choice between cheap stocks, and (relatively) expensive bitcoin.

Dude. Just get the money that you are owed, and buy with that. Don’t loose money to interest if you don’t have to.

Was gonna say user name checks out... 
I agree. I don’t think a stock market crash is going to drive the masses to bitcoin. Every time stocks crash, it almost seems like bitcoin drops with it. Maybe institutional investors are capitalizing on the lower prices of traditional investments.

Because the pornhub logo might trigger people trying not to fap. It’s kind of a serious issue for those people- posting a meme kinda trivializes the struggle some of those people are facing. Personally, I think a fap a day keeps anxiety away.

He probably just scalped enough satoshis to make the short term capital gains difference of 10-20%. It’s an unpopular opinion, but some people truly are making more than the short term difference in taxes by day trading.

Like, say... demand?

I really hope you didn’t just sell at a loss because of a 10% drop (that was expected after the price blew straight past 7k).

Fringe, Avengelical, Pro-Life people can benefit the ecosystem like anyone else. Mass adoption doesn’t only apply to people that you identify with.

Best advice here. Stay safe, keep your keys safe.
