Really, this idea doesn't even have to point at cancer, it can be used for whatever ails you.  And the criteria to release the funds would be public... I get that cancer is complicated and there's no "catch all" cure.  ugh, I knew I should have been more explicit in this part.

They have this same type brand of machine at the rose &amp; crown in edmonton.  Bought BTC from it last week, and yes it was incredibly easy.
It displays the rate, asks you to scan your public key qr code against the glass on the bottom right side, and asks you to insert money.  You tap the screen when you're done inserting money- and you get your BTC within hours.

Entirely the government is to blame here.  Who instituted the fed?  Who keeps them alive?  Who imprisons you if you pay merchants with any other currency (before BTC)?
Without a government, how would the Fed keep a float?  People would just switch to a stable currency, or at least a currency that doesn't steal from them (through inflation) every year.

Do you find it kind of nice that the price has settled a bit for the last couple months?  The headlines are less "It's volatile" and more "bitcoin CEO said X" hehe.
Every time I hit I'm always excited to see all the innovation here, like offline transactions using some crazy math?
Also, along the lines of SR2- it's been said that drug related crimes (online) are nearly non-existent with the ability to buy drugs from your living room.  That's pretty cool imo.
I, personally have less than $50 in BTC, I used to have more, but had to sell it cause broke.  But, I'm always so glad to be a part of the bitcoin revolution- it's really inspiring what people are doing here.

As an economist, you should be aware that a government ban on X, drives up the price of X.  For example, we haven't seen cocaine fail because it's outlawed.

You haven't told me anything other than you don't believe in the idea.  Can you provide me with any reasons why?  
"corruption, fraudsters, banksters, terrorists, etc" is not a reason.
The fact that you cannot see how you would make a company able to accomplish the goal doesn't really refute anything either.

Depends on how long after we're talking.  Come 25 years, quatum computing may be very prevalent for the average consumer.  This makes breaking into wallets more possible if there has been transactions OUT of the wallet.
I forget where I heard this, I just remember that come quantum computing, bitcoins are safe in any wallet until they have been spent from that wallet.

@_date: 2016-01-19 15:50:58


Lol'd how terribly predictable 
@_date: 2016-01-21 07:51:03
It's because it's often more prudent to invest in businesses than in a single currency.
For instance:
* If bitcoin actually crashes, you're SOL if your plan was to HODL and have developers make it great.  You've lost bitcoin AND developer costs.  Not great from a risk management standpoint.  But you could make a lot of money if you did it right, and the market agreed with your development decisions.
* Say you instead invest in Kraken- if bitcoin crashes, you'll be effected - but you won't lose all your money.  The company will restructure and adapt to this change.  After all, Kraken supports a variety of crypto-currency and fiat- dealing with bitcoin is just one of the services it provides.  If bitcoin does well- you'll get more in customers and fees, so you'll do well in that situation as well.
@_date: 2016-06-28 17:17:34
Just like those "FREE trade agreements".  I have no idea how trade was done before hand.  Surely couldn't have been free
@_date: 2015-03-19 16:26:43
Exactly.  If people are keeping their bitcoin with a 3rd party, that's not a very good idea.  If people are keeping their bitcoin with an anonymous 3rd party who has no real-world reputation to risk, that's a WORSE idea.
It would be as if I decided to lend some guy I didn't know $100 and he told me to meet on some street corner a week later and he'd repay me then.  Lets not be surprised when he doesn't show- I still have no info about him, there's no risk for him not showing up.

@_date: 2013-12-12 01:29:40
WTF?  Where did the circlejerking go?  TO THE MOON DAMN IT.
But seriously, It'll be a while before any price stabilization happens, it will probably go up for a lot longer than most anticipate.  This is due to the new markets it's creating- and those markets may create new markets, etc, etc.
A purely free-market is something not to be underestimated.

Change it in a much sillier way.  Make your phrase, increase all the letters in the phrase by 7.  The letter a becomes h, z becomes g, etc.  Then re-order the phrase based on the second letter of each word.
Etc, etc.  Sure it doesn't add too much to the complexity, but it does require a conscious effort on the programmer's part to think up obscene ways to hack this sort of wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:06:49
LOL!  I C WHUT U DID THAR!
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:03:02
This is a good point.  And I think much of the evidence is often overlooked:
The only site that has been 'hacked' and has not given a refund or has otherwise made sure that their user's funds have not been stolen is Silk Road.  Other sites have been hacked and always make sure their users are not effected.
Banks used to work in the same way- before they became corporate.
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:41:08
Yes, thanks for this.  My original idea sucks, but this sounds much better.  A phrase like this would be much better:
The bird and the bees are singing sjd09e8Edkieoa=92 in the trees.
