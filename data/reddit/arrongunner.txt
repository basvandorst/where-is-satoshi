Or just wait for the next train I gather, I assume their transport system has trains as frequently as London underground, as In every 2 minutes or so?

To be honest that's a much easier problem to manage. Reducing the size increases accountability. So it's a step in the right direction.

Thus has been common knowledge since 2008 no? Anyone working in the industry knew they did this...
However I believe it's only the German banks that do this in particular.

I mean yeah but it's such low rate (a percent or less) and it's not like any other payment method would remove that cost. Of you have to pay it with cash you'd also have to pay it with crypto

It's debit card not a credit card but you know... (aka it's you own savings and no loaned money)
And companies are very very deep into the cars and contactless game now. It's far last the point when they can add extra charges for cards. In fact 5/10 years ago a charge for cards was slightly common. But now it's been phased out and classed as a cost of just doing business.
I'm pretty sure the benifits of speedy service completely mask the cost of cards for business now days anyway so really it doesn't actually hurt anyone.

I mean that and crypto costs more to transfer and takes longer than every normal cashless option in most countries....
Sure the banks pay whatever but a bank transfer in the uk, or contact less payment for instance costs the user nothing and is instant

My last visa purchase cost me nothing (along with every visa purchase I've ever made) .... sure it might cost the company accepting payment a little bit but that's made up for by the speed gained through contactless payment and self service etc. In fact the gains made from self service alone probably swallow the whole cost.
(Yes you can use some self service with cash but many are going card only now to save space and increase effeciency)
This is in the UK though. I think we're the world leaders for financial tech and adoption, with some of the more seamless methods of moving money around.

Prices don't change if it's card or cash so it's not an explicit visa charge

Mate trust me we all use debit cards and credit cards in the UK. Not sure where you're getting your info from...
We are amongst the world leaders in fintech basically due to our low fintech regulations, so companies like revolut can spring up. And our payment tech is just simple shit that gets widely adopted. So my primary method of payment now days is android pay, which is basically my debit card. Then for larger buys I use my actual debit followed by the very rare circumstance where I'm forced to use cash. I personally don't have a credit card but most people do, I'm a bit of an outlier in that regard.
However unlike the US bank transfers clear in hours and pretty much everywhere takes contactless / debit now days (and none of that signing rubbish you do for your credit cards) those are some of the main factors I'd cite as indicators of developed payment technologies.
I'm pretty sure banks keep credit records of us, outstanding loans absolutely affect your ability to get a mortgage, but unlike you lot we let our bank keep those records not some easy to hack Equifax nonsense.
You are at least right that obscene credit borrowing is seen as pretty stupid to do here and generally dissuaded. But credit cards still get used due to their nice bonuses, however they pretty much get paid off every month.
I haven't been to Japan but from what I've heard they are generally quite behind in payment systems.

It will drop to wherever it will drop to, might be $10 might be $40, but the sheer amount of people hoping for another bubble should produce another one in itself, I certainly intend to buy when it gets around the $40 mark, we should see the freefall curve out when this begins to happen, so that should be the buy signal. Although the loss of confidence generated by this burst will probably mean the next bubble will be a bit smaller than this current one, and it will stay like that untill people begin to gain confidence again. So in the long run it will probably get back to the $200 mark but over the next few weeks i would buy at $40 then sell at around $150, or whatever profit point you are comfortable with around there.
