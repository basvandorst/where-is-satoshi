Then why does the FAQ say this: "This improvement is accomplished by spreading bandwidth usage out over time for full nodes, which means IBLT and weak blocks may allow for safer **future increases to the max block size**."

Or maybe they are moving carefully, methodically, and slowly so as not to break anything along the way? At the very least, I don't think you can say that it is "abundantly clear" that they will not be raising the block size when they imply that they will.

Transaction fees per block could match the current block reward with sufficiently high fee amounts and transaction volume.

I've read and understood the Satoshi paper myself and I would never invest more than I can afford to lose. It's not that hard to do this in a sane manner, but you do have to be careful, and I agree it's important for people to be cautious with something they don't understand.

actually you can just buy and wait it for it to raise, and it's more like having stock in a tech start-up than a lottery ticket, albeit both are risky

bringing or introducing an invention to the world is very different than disclosing exactly how it was made. as for your question, ill let you answer that for yourself.

Satoshi and the other developers put a block size limit in place as a temporary measure to protect against denial-of-service attacks as the network grew. The change required to the code is simple and has already been written. The main arguments opposing the change are that it could lead to fewer nodes and more centralization. Here's a good summary of the arguments:

it increases the maximum number of transaction per second that the network can handle

I'm still not following why you think the content has the value of zero. They stated the dangers of contentious hard forks, and stated that nearly any new feature can be done through a soft fork. There have even been proposals for raising the block size through a soft fork. 
However, I do agree with you that it should be clarified how "near-universal agreement" is determined.

How is that the same as saying nothing at all? You may disagree, but at the very least, it must be acknowledged that they are saying something.

Git is a chain of hashes with no proof-of-work and thus trivial to rehash as needed, unlike Bitcoin. Git is not immutable. Bitcoin is.

Or perhaps what you are "basically" talking about is actually your state of mind disguised as a perception, causing you to see a reflection of the internal in the external.

Would a rational, skeptical observer be able to confidently assert what all similarly natured persons would or would not find compelling? Or would such an observer leave open the possibility of self-deceit, thereby ensuring that his or her reason is more than mere sophistry, and skepticism more than sheer hypocrisy?

He was making the point that a true "trusted third party" does not exist, which is the premise of the value proposition of a private blockchain.

this is just the labor pains of the bitcoin birth, hang on, it's going to be wild in the short term, but once the infrastructure matures the price will become remarkably stable.

It's a short-medium term solution, not a long-term solution. It's a way of building out the infrastructure and the marketplace, which will vastly increase the stability of the price. BTC volatility is to be expected with such a young currency that's barely even had a chance to grow up.

I can 100% guarantee that you are wrong. If only 2.5% of deposits are held in bitcoin, 1 BTC will be equal to $700,000.

Isn't giving merchants and governments the choice and ability to validate ID part of the freedom of bitcoin? Governments and companies that go this route will still need to compete with those that don't. Let the democratic dynamics of the marketplace, not some unilaterally imposed ideology, decide what systems have the most value.

But you can regulate the exchanges operating in the U.S. Some consumers might actually want some consumer protection regulation when doing business with bitcoin exchanges. Some large corporations and institutions would likely require bitcoin intermediaries to be regulated prior to investing significant capital. The beauty of bitcoin is there's room for both the free-wheeling libertarians as well as those who prefer or require regulated markets.
