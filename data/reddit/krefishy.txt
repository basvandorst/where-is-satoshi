you seem to be misinformed, the ISPs are NOT publicly opposed to it. They are remaining quiet on the front because they are FOR removing net neutrality and if the consumers see they actively pursuing its elimination, that they will look bad. These ISPs want Net Neutrality gone, that’s why they’ve been shoveling money to the republicans to make it happen.

i can’t believe people upvoted this. These companies will fuck over consumers, THEY ARE MONOPOLIES, NOT PURELY COMPETITIVE FIRMS!!!! They will enact predatory pricing and can kill off small business with ease if this passes. This is all corporation based, corporations want to make even more money than they already do. Again, these are monopolies and not purely competitive firms!!! It is too late to eliminate Net Neutrality if we do not want bad things to happen...

it’s not a free market while the ISPs are monopolies in most areas...when all these were small firms it could’ve worked, but it is too late now, these monopolies would have so much power with Net Neutrality...

do you know how you can get your coins off coinbase and onto a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:27:02
Sorry i'm a noobie and I don't really understand this at all. 
So what should i do as a coinbase user who has purchased BTC, ETH and LTC through coinbase? Should i transfer them all to a hardware wallet?

Exactly! A lot of people misunderstand our nations debt.

debt will never go away, that's just political propaganda to make candidates sound good

why would i choose a hardware wallet over a paper wallet? isn't a paper wallet just a piece of paper with your keys written on it?
