@_date: 2014-12-09 04:57:54
Nice! :D 
@_date: 2014-12-09 04:43:56
how is your return on that?
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:37:16
Whatever Troll.
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:06:16
This is a real event. It is a matter of fact, not opinion.
@_date: 2014-11-21 18:34:40
@_date: 2014-12-09 04:40:46
Bitcoin will always rise.
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:36:58
playing with money is not stupid. think whatever you like.
@_date: 2014-10-16 21:50:08
There is no excuse.
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:21:24
No one said Bitcoin was a ponzi scheme. Rather, it is CoinBase that has created a culture of denying customer services by labeling it so-called "high risk" without any real merits backing it up.
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:34:19
your friend sounds uneducated. some people have their minds made up. I say "fuck him" and cash in on all the bitcoins and laugh all the way to the bank.

Where is the link?
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:59:52
 -- nevermind
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:42:14
Ya... That just happened. FYI, I don't use two different nicks. Stop playing and go read a book. There are no bridges here.
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:04:24
None of the money was recovered.
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:31:23
What would be the purpose of lying about said event? The message here is awareness. You can take it for what it is worth. If you disagree, that is fine. It won't held against you.
@_date: 2014-12-09 05:02:42
smart idea. just buy then sell right?
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:23:50
Actually, that's just word play. There is no suggestion Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:49:08
/highfive :D
@_date: 2014-10-16 22:04:45
Because, Links aren't always good enough.
@_date: 2015-03-19 20:02:08
What do you mean?
@_date: 2015-03-20 04:16:40
yes. any questions come to me. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 21:09:48
We need people to register first, there will be more products as vendors come in. The idea is...to NOT fuck everyone like Evo and make it a safer, better marketplace. I am the one of the guys behind Overthrow. I care what people want, believe good products, services provided in a decentralized marketplace work. 
Keep in mind, this just the beta stage. So, we are asking for people to sign up and become a vendor. We will roll out more products soon. 
EDIT: We will do exactly that and show a screenshot of product submission page along with products.
@_date: 2015-03-19 21:28:16
Currently in beta stage.

@_date: 2015-03-19 21:44:36
@_date: 2015-03-19 20:59:46
what would make it enticing?
@_date: 2015-03-19 20:00:44
The website is currently a beta. I feel with everyone use to the way Evolution worked. There is a better answer.
@_date: 2015-02-17 02:07:43
Yes, I want to do this. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:58:27

@_date: 2015-02-05 20:50:43

@_date: 2015-03-19 20:46:25

@_date: 2015-03-20 18:42:58

Glitches will fixed soon.
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:28:24

@_date: 2015-02-16 23:24:36

@_date: 2015-02-05 20:52:32

@_date: 2015-02-17 02:51:42
