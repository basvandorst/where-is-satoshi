When did I say it wasn't?
@_date: 2013-05-15 00:56:23
lol no
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:07:36
Every sub has a 99% chance of going to shit after 20K subs.
@_date: 2013-03-09 22:27:47


This is incredibly false.
@_date: 2013-03-09 00:09:49
My god. You obviously are one of the exact people I'm talking about.  I also don't really care but the fact of the matter is you're a small percentage.  Soon you won't be, but you still are.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:07:29
Please take some pictures. Also do these people know their lunch was paid for by btc and do any of them seem interested?  I also sent a donation to your key, thanks for what you do :).
@_date: 2013-03-07 07:32:01
Downvoted by people who bought at 47 lol?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:30:50
I never made a claim either. I just said that those numbers made me laugh.
@_date: 2013-03-12 07:04:00
Not that it's bad or anything, but things like this will put off a lot of people interested in bit coins. Likewise tons of people who think bitcoin is a great rich quick scheme would be attracted to it...
@_date: 2013-03-08 23:17:12
Most people know it but a lot of people try to pretend its not true.
@_date: 2013-03-26 06:10:05
Oh yeah I forgot that people don't buy drugs or child porn with US dollars.
@_date: 2013-03-08 23:49:52


How many states do you think allow such. Even with so many states with medical theres only a few states where it's like everyone can get it for anything really. So the majority of the US and world does not have access to that...
@_date: 2013-03-25 22:31:54
Once every sub gets to 20K subs its 99% likely to turn to shit.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:20:22


@_date: 2013-03-21 18:15:12
Which is the majority still. Many people try to play it off like its only a small minority that's the drug buyers and sellers that use BTC which is absolute shit.
@_date: 2013-03-26 06:08:52
But I hate the 4 day wait so fucking much &gt;:(
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:23:00
But, but, he wanted one that looked like *that*.......
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:09:55
Nah your numbers were way off get over it.
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:46:28
lets try this "bitcoin sucks"
@_date: 2013-03-12 06:55:13


Then why are you even buying drugs? Seems counter intuitive. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:41:41
and it jumps right back up 
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:14:07
Well they can't be right because you said today it'll be 170 and its only 75 :(
@_date: 2013-02-26 17:15:33
im pretty sure most of services like coinbase do this as well and when you use SR it uses escrow so as long as you don't spend 2 whole days making an order it shouldnt affect you
@_date: 2013-03-08 20:56:13
I'm not saying its wrong or anything, its probably a good idea as people will always want drugs but not everyone will always be able to get them. But there are **tons** of people around here to swear that the majortiy of the bitcoins are used by investors and for people to buy goods and pay bills.  Haha yeah right. I'd say *maybe* 25% is that. But the rest is drugs and gambling. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:45:57
This really gave me a good long laugh. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:27:16


@_date: 2013-03-08 18:35:25


To bad no one wants to admit that.
@_date: 2013-03-26 17:54:54
No its not even that.  People *expect* the answer to be right in front of their face, to have everything handed to them.  Thanks to people like you who think that builds social skills lmao.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:33:11
LOL looks like someone was wrong. 89 atm.
@_date: 2013-03-26 01:55:55


If someone posts something that is posted here everyday this does not apply.  I see the same 5 threads pop up everyday. Its like being 'new' gives you an excuse to be lazy, not read anything on your own, and expecting answers to everything right infront of your face, which it is, but they're to lazy to use the search bar, or try google.
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:33:53


@_date: 2013-03-26 17:53:52
Don't think it worked :(
@_date: 2013-03-20 02:52:50
What really stops them from just banning the use of all fiat online currency and the only currency you could us would be US dollar for example?
@_date: 2013-03-09 07:04:36


Don't have access to cheap medical weed on a consistent basis without risk of being arrested. Ergo - the reason most people use SR. Are you fucking stupid or trolling?
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:49:43
because to many people are treating bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme
