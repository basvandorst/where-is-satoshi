You could always look at my history to prove this.

I know it's Reddit and all but this really is childish.
Disclosure: I hold less than 1 LTC mostly received from tips.

I guess I have lost $20 or $30 or something so it could be!

So when It was 3 and it went to 48 people jump on the wagon then it does from 48 to 3 the same people panic.
Okay these people might not be bright and have absolutely no clue about investing but designing a picture only to make fun of them is pretty childish.

I guess around $50,000 worth, settling everything else get a new car and invest the rest in 10 different places making bitcoin 1/10 of my investment.

I'm nervous to tip as that tip could be worth hundreds in a couple of weeks. I want to get some money into bit coin as I like the premise but it just seems impossibly hard or costly.
The conversion from currency has to get easier it seems like currently you are paying for the difficult of getting your money in.

UK, It's possible but it's expensive unless you are buying in large chunks. Works out about 25% over market rates.

I'm not sure that change would happen overnight. If they were to just sell up all USD and pump it into BTC the markets would be in turmoil much better to do it slowly.

Only ASIC's can give those kind of numbers and they are an investment. It's a single core of a X3363 CPU

Thanks. looks dead but looks interesting and my birthday and cakeday are coming up soon so who knows!
@_date: 2013-11-16 14:46:39
Thanks, No one has explained there was a private key at all so far it makes so much more sense now. I'm off to back up a few wallets even tho' I only have a few satoshi currently as I was under the impression I only needed to record my wallet ID.

I'm new to bitcoins so forgive my ignorance.
Don't you have to give your wallet address to people in order to get them to transfer bitcoin to you? At which point it's known so no generating is needed as they have your wallet address. I'm kind of lost at what secures your wallet other than obscurity.

That is where I was, while the cashouts are lower. I still have to rinse / repeat 1000 times before I can cashout.
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:25:32
Most kind of you. If nothing else I can pass this forward at some point.
Plus it can help me get to grips with the transaction costs.
@_date: 2013-11-12 23:41:56
What are the minimum purchases? It costs me nothing to keep the miner working now it's set up (free power)
@_date: 2013-11-12 23:40:05
Seems again they are all on the never, just do something 284,000 times and we might deposit something.
@_date: 2013-11-12 23:58:34
Tried about 10.. I have no bitcoins. If you have an example of one that works that would be great.
