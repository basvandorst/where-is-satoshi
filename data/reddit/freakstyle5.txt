Can anyone explain to me what is happening or what has happened? I'm new to bitcoin and also new to this sub.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:57:27
 Oh god. I could feel the pain of people who has alot of money invested in bitcoins. Good thing I'm poor..
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:07:49
Go for it!
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:11:19
Aayy. I'd actually consider watching aantonop videos productive. *compared to looking at memes*
@_date: 2019-03-08 14:47:27
Also, check out  if you want to watch some debates concerning bitcoin. Nothing wrong with listening to the arguments of the opposing side.

True. I don't think most southeast asians agree with that though

This is so true lol. You only need to be white and not obese.

Maybe he sounds like a broken record to some, but that doesn't mean we should just ignore those topics/issues.
@_date: 2017-01-23 13:06:48
Probably. Also, most people here  think that if you have light colored skin, you will automatically be atleast average in terms of attractiveness, whether or not you have a pretty face.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:41:26
And what does that help us achieve?
@_date: 2016-11-08 00:48:51
Ohwell. I aint american but goodluck. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 15:26:10
It's almost like an eli5
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:15:42
yeah because our local malls, restaurants and grocery stores will definitely accept bitcoin if I told them to.
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:53:28
I get what you mean. Unfortunately the world hasn't completely adopted bitcoin yet so some of us really have to resort to bitcoin debit cards as we really have no choice.


Good fucking luck paying with your BTC in a 3rd world country.

whatever you say bud.

A 3rd world country somewhere in Southeast Asia (Not Singapore/Malaysia). Not to mention I live in the province. So chances of businesses accepting bitcoin is definitely alot lower. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:43:22
TenX is currently only for EU countries right? Correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-02-07 05:12:47
Yeah, if only I had more money for investing.

We’ll soon be announcing availability of the Ledger Wallet application. We’ll first release the desktop version during Q2 2018 and then focus on the mobile version Q3 2018. The new version of the Ledger Manager is also expected for Q2 2018. Stay tuned!

Bitcoin's tech is shit, huh. You definitely don't know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2016-10-31 14:31:37
Then what do you suggest using if you live in a 3rd world country which currently doesnt accept bitcoin payments?
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:36:31

What's your point? People don't understand the world wide web(FTP, SMTP, Servers) either but people still use it.
