A ban IS on the cards. I don’t know where your counterpart gets his info but you will know this is actually serious by just reading general news from multiple, reliable news outlets. 
The General Attorney announced that they will start to work on a regulation to ban trading cryptocurrency. He also stated that cryptocurrency is in fact not a currency but a gambling chip. Of course an actual ban will depend much on two investigations launched a couple of days ago - IRS on bithumb and criminal investigation for illegal gambling on Coinone. Even though those involved are furious, the mass concensus is that a regulation might help - it’s crazy here, seriously. 
Here’s an article that is on the front page of the largest online/mobile site in Korea, pass it to anyone who understands Korean and you can get the idea - 
Also, to get an unbiased opinion, ask ppl for facts who do not have anything to lose from the ban.
