In Canada, it's the only time you can short. No shorting on downticks allowed, only upticks. US hasn't figured this out.

Well if you were looking to increase adoption, I'd say the amount of people reporting opening their brand new wallets due to your tips is encouraging

I need to stop creeping your u/ page, but from a finance bro: Reminiscences of a Stock Operator is fantastic. I would have suggested A Random Walk to you ages ago in mumble but it completely slipped my mind. 
Another good one to read is The Intelligent Investor but I don't know the application it would have to BTC, because the focus by Ben Graham is on value investing. Still a fantastic (and practically mandatory) read for any finance student, it at least gives you a better understanding of our "bricks and mortar" markets.
Graham has another book, Security Analysis, and it's much the same style as Intelligent Investor. Focuses on analysing stocks etc. The three I mentioned plus A Random Walk are all great reads, and may actually get you into regular investing as well. WarningL be prepared for whiplash between Intelligent Investor and A Random Walk because they are two essentially opposing theories. A+ reads all around

I thought you just explained how it IS sorely undervalued. Why don't you just buy 210 now? Take out a line of credit and make the purchase! The interest on the line of credit will be peanuts compared to the cool 2 million you'll make

Day trading provides market information. The fewer trades there are, the less price information there is, therefore the more volatile and risky the commodity. Heavy volumes of day trading provide a lot of price information based on market sentiment. This also means that it is reflecting a more accurate idea of what the commodity is worth, so day trading is not "driving the price down". In fact, the more bitcoin mined, the less it will be worth, simple economics there my friend. If people have attached value to something like BTC, and all of a sudden supply disappears? Cha-ching.

Like Bitcoin! Apple Pay is very much alive
So are the basic fundamentals of how a company in a capital market should work. 
Not all debt is bad - just because a tech company in the middle of an explosive growth cycle in a tech boom managed it, doesn't mean everybody was impressed

 See, now we just know you're ignorant. Do you know anything about debt, optimal debt/equity ratios and proper use of leverage? Cause if you aren't just a moron with an armchair finance degree, you should know better

Except for the current long-term debt of $40,072,000,000 and short term debt of $3,799,000,000 on their balance sheet...
Debt/Equity ratio of 0.34 as of March 2x15

Except all the miners who have to sell all the coins they generate. I doubt they will sell...

Invest in paycoin. It's going to be worth $20 someday!
