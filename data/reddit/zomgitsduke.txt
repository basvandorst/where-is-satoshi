I think it will be slow. When banks charge you to hold money, value in currency fluctuates, and stores pass the merchant fee from credit cards on to customers, then we will see a faster adoption.

We don't need to rely on every user to learn to secure their bitcoin, but we also need to realize that bitcoin allows us to escape the risk of an exchange (such as a bank) to go under and take our money with them.
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:11:15


I have bitcoin on a Trezor and on my phone under mycelium. It takes me maybe 45 seconds to send my money to an exchange to sell, and 2 minutes to start up my trezor to send money to the same exchange.

Leaving my money in an exchange for 5 minutes is nowhere as risky as leaving it in an exchange for months. The theft would have to happen right then and there as my money is in the exchange.

I took almost everything out. Honestly, 10% is not that much, and it's more like 3%, 3% and 4% spread through some exchanges, so if one fails it sucks but at least I have a bit all over the place.

Deserve is perhaps the wrong term. However, the degree to which you are a victim is greatly reduced when you make poor choices. We have now had two major exchanges (three if you bring ETH into the mix) where people have lost their cryptocurrency due to trusting an exchange to store their money.
@_date: 2016-08-07 20:33:55


I know it sucks, but trusting your money with a company, especially after the recent MtGox situation, is doing something wrong. If you took your money out and secured it properly, you wouldn't be in this situation.

I can only imagine bitcoin familiarity being like web design before the .com burst. If you could confidently just speak about web design and anything internet, you had people throwing their money at you to speak, train others, set up systems, etc.
Remembering how it made certain internet firms crazy rich (once met a guy who started a simple tech business as an early 20-something in the early 90's and has been retired since 2004, his investments make him a salary of ~$250k every year), so I'd be more than happy to get into some sort of public speaking gig.

This is what's going to be the "killer app" for bitcoin... super simple use without customers realizing how quickly they spend their money. Go back to freemium games, and they always have you convert cash into gems which buy tokens which buy extra lives. If cash buys bitcoin and bitcoin buys products, then customers will at first have that separation of monetary value, and spend a lot.
Just food(licorice) for thought

Let the blockchain rise, and fail miserably. Then while companies are busy trying to make their own blockchain(just for bragging rights), they will fall behind as true blockchains thrive.
Think of it like early internet. Companies HAD to have websites, didn't even matter for what reason. Nowadays, websites do everything after it had some time to fix itself.
A lot of people got wealthy in the 90s from early internet technology. The same will happen with blockchain tech. This time, however, many of us have the coin that makes it run. We are already vested into the oncoming system.

So if I have $50000000 to invest in bitcoin, I'd gladly vote for things that offer a quick price rise (but bad for bitcoin in the long run) so I can just sell it off for a quick profit.

Some people just want quick returns. When bitcoin is stagnant, my money could work better elsewhere.
I can wait 6 months on 7% return, or I can find something else and earn 12% return.
Eventually, yes bitcoin will most likely go up in price, but if I set up a system to buy a bunch the second it hits a price level, I'll still be covered.
It's the efficiency calculations that people are using.
Also, the person that has 10000 bitcoins is eventually going to want to sell a few here and there to enjoy their life, since bitcoin can't buy everything just yet.

You are better off to consider bitcoin as a currency. You can invest in it and the value may fluctuate. However it does not imply ownership of a part of a company.
You can buy and sell bitcoin like a stock, but also realize that the stock itself can be used to buy things.
Start small. Get a small amount of bitcoin. Maybe $20 worth for funsies. See how it works, transfer it from a wallet to another, try using different apps and see what you like. Make a small purchase in bitcoin.
When you get a better understanding, buy some more. Rinse and repeat.

I somewhat feel that it came just a little too early to take off just yet. Thankfully we have a working system that, at any time, can be improved for current needs.
I think if it started as mass-adoption of bitcoin was taking place (I mean everyone talking about and using it, to the point of credit card popularity in the late 90's), then it would be immediately successful from day 1, since middleman fees would raise overall prices for any competing service. At the same time it also gives us time to develop a great system before a company can sneak in and get way over-involved (which would turn them into leaders and innovators for a more profitable environment for their business, leading to abuse).
@_date: 2016-04-05 12:22:38

They'll be outpaced eventually, because every time they turn down a free shot at transaction fees, they turn down the ability to buy that much more in mining rigs.

One of the key components of currency is fungibility.
Sure, that makes sense for some uses, and might even be useful.
But what happens when a government wants to flag coins as invalid because one political party is challenging their authority? Or maybe a Bitcoin mining center is challenging the earnings of mostly Chinese mining operations? Do we exclude their coins because they challenged a large Bitcoin operation? Or how about after 10 years of diligent savings, it turns out your employer was using stolen coins that were sent through a mixer? Does your savings account now get invalidated?
Money needs to be able to flow between people freely. Every time you want to add hints of authority to the ecosystem, you remove what makes Bitcoin so valuable.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:28:46
Saying you're involved in blockchain technology is like saying you're investing in tcp/ip and your intranet is going to be just as groundbreaking as the internet.
What makes Bitcoin most valuable is that it is decentralized like the internet. If banks want to use blockchain, let them. They won't get the same results as a free and open currency.

We will have cryptocurrencies being made for so many different uses, just like we have so many websites made. Hell, I make websites for fun all the time.
But cryptocurrency protocols are going to be a lot like programming language. There are thousands of languages out there, including some that only use &lt;&gt;\[] and ^ to code things. No one builds a useful app in these, but they're great ways for people to learn better languages, explore concepts in computer science, challenge themselves to optimize code in order to discover useful ways to make our tech better.

I think this is a very valuable point being made.
When does the younger generation become the mainstream generation? It seems that many people who take progressive ideas (working on the internet, not participating in "old" systems, branching away from material possessions, etc) are refusing to play into the financial system that was developed and established before the internet. It only makes sense to the new generation that the internet could be used for money. And it's a wealth transfer from old systems to new. Those who refuse to participate are the ones who will lose out, very much like people who thought the printed press industry, cable industry, etc. would never die.

But let's say you do 50% crypto 50% index funds. In either situation, if one crashes, you still have holdings.
If you assume that anything can fail, why put all of your eggs in one basket?
In the situation outlined by the comment above, if you're right, you'll be really right. But if you're wrong, you've just lost your life savings. I'd rather balance things out, but to each their own.

Gold was used as both a currency and investment at one point in history.
The reason why we have such a weird view of money is that there have been so many rules, systems, organizations, and behaviors that really change the way we look at money. We expect to have distinctions that help us figure out money in different contexts. Think of this as a "back to basics" approach to money. Bitcoin is a scarce thing that represents value. We can use it to purchase or sell items without having to worry about trading goods since that process is tedious. Drop ideas about laws, inflation, investing to earn value over time, etc. These complicated systems will most likely arise, but this time we are having people actively participate in a "clean slate" procedure.

So when a company decides on policy, they create a set of rules that must follow, in order to make sure they don't treat customers differently.
Your transaction wasn't typical. Instead of having someone go in and spend an hour or two fixing it so they don't get hit with a $5 fee, they instead go the path of their plan.
Remember, fixing this issue manually means they would have to use an employee's payrate to fix this, and if it takes an hour, that could be $50.
However, you did catch an interesting inefficiency. If you email it to their support section, they might be appreciative.
Just a thought.

Which is a sign of a good open market.
Let the miners only accept a minimum fee. Let users decide if they will use it. There will be a middle ground. And eventually mining pools will have more room in their blocks for lower transactions. It only makes sense that miners take small fees in addition to larger ones, because more money is better than less money.

Secondly, anyone can make it, just like anyone can make a program, smartphone app, photo, website, youtube video, etc.
We're seeing money move from a limited medium (like landline phones, fax machines, horse and buggy, etc) and we're expanding the reach of what the technology does. This is not only a computer science based progress, but also a philosophical jump into how we define money. Money is a language that is used to express value. Why shouldn't we have multiple languages? We have multiple languages in programming, and we've found that each has a use case as a specific way to communicate value.

@_date: 2018-01-25 13:47:08


Yeah, there are some major issues. Increasing block size without a second layer(off-chain stuff) is only a temporary fix. This fix also has some major repercussions. It makes the duty of running a node more difficult(oddly enough in terms of RAM requirements of a node).
Lightning isn't the only solution either. I'm open to hearing about new breakthroughs in the field and seeing where it goes.
Additionally, I see the benefit of first implementing lightning, then increasing block size slowly over time. A 2x block increase without lightning gives double capacity for the network. A 1.1x block increase with lightning will probably give a MASSIVE increase in capacity for the network... like 100x capacity increase, since that 0.1MB can hold thousands upon thousands of lightning channel summaries of transactions.


It depends on how that crypto is set up, honestly.
Some people have tried to solve it, and that crypto works well. But at the same time, there are downsides to not having every transaction kept. Remember, every "solution" runs the risk of not working as intended. Putting lightning on layer 2 makes it optional, as no one is forced to use that layer. But if you start making changes to layer 1, you make everyone commit to your change, and some people might not benefit from it.
I have a feeling we will see multiple attempts at layer 2 solutions. And then layer 3, then 4, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:13:07
It is very unwise to keep your life savings in the same wallet you are using to buy something via Bitcoin.
I imagine we will see a system where you have something like checking and savings. Open a lightning network that has something like 2 of 3 multisig so in order to move money from savings, you would have a hardware wallet, smartphone, and another backup hardware wallet to move money. I bet in time you could have some cool features:
* Automatic "allowance" that moves from savings to checking, or vice versa
* Savings always funds checking to a set amount. Checking account sends excess funds back to savings
* Limits set unless you have pins that are associated with each level of movement of funds
This is like saying it should be impossible to send your boss a blank email. Solutions will arise.

I get where he is coming from. The dude spends his whole life learning/influencing a system and along comes an internet protocol that challenges everything. Thing is, he can't predict human behavior and he can't predict how things will play out.
"With almost certainty" is a dangerous idea to be throwing around. I run a small WhatsApp group about crypto, and our 4 finance guys kept going on about how it was a bubble that should have popped a while back, but now that they're involved in discussions and whatnot, they've warmed up to the idea of holding 5% in crypto for their positions. Suddenly, it's not about calling it a bubble, but rather a risky asset that deserves a tiny chunk of their portfolio. Two guys have moved to 10% and don't really plan on selling what they are holding.
I think Bitcoin, like the internet, is something that is so radical that you don't really "get it" until you've played around with the tech, learned what it does, experienced the vastness of the crypto world, and actually made a small investment. Once you start figuring out what this ecosystem is doing to money, you find yourself asking "WHY THE HELL DIDN'T WE DO THIS DECADES AGO?!?!?!" Except we did try this... but the technology wasn't up to par, and the environment wasn't ripe. Nowadays with ApplePay and GooglePay, Paypal, Venmo, and several other services, people are experienced in this ecosystem and welcoming of a system that isn't trying to take their money. Rather, it's a co-op of money, enforced by unbiased technology that is open source. People are getting sick of corporations building a great business, then dialing back the benefits and features in the name of extracting profits. Why not invest in something that has no incentive to take all your money, but rather WANTS to be your money? Kinda reminds me of the "good" bacteria in our gut. For perpetuating the tech, we receive a free and open money system.

Sure. If you have a robust knowledge base of cryptocurrency, combined with an understanding of investing, distributed systems, and cryptography, one could justify a larger position.

The value assigned to Bitcoin is speculative, meaning people are betting that the price will go up, based on what they know.
You wanna get in on it? Think of an amount of money you'd like to pay right now to buy "missed the bus" insurance. Break that up into 12 equal parts, and buy that much in Bitcoin (or any other crypto) on the 1st of each month.

There are some coins that show promise. However, it is not wise to go all-in on coins with the expectation that you're single choice of over 2000 coins will succeed... unless you did a damn good job vetting the coins with impressive technical knowledge.

@_date: 2018-01-25 16:33:49
This is definitely something to note.
However, if you've got a decent holding and can afford to "gamble" $100 of Bitcoin into a lightning node and are okay with losing it, go have some fun and learn stuff. Those skills are worth far more than $100 that you might not even lose.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:25:07
Our crypto chat group is playing around with the idea of opening channels with each other. We're all over the world (in all continents except for Africa and Antarctica), so having these channels opens a lot of diverse payment pathways. We suspect we will make just enough to cover hardware/electricity costs, but it would be really cool to build this network.

The best thing you can do right now is invest your mind into the space.
Not only will it help the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but it will also greatly benefit you if you have some basic skills in crypto, especially niche things like a specific feature(LN) of a specific cryptocurrency.

At one point buying 100 was unaffordable by most. Then 10. Then 1. Now, for most buying 0.1 is even unobtainable.
My prediction is that from this point forward, if you can't buy a whole one now, no amount of time and regular investments will ever get you to whole one.
And at some point, owning 0.1 will be a similar game.

Sure, but you can't really run a node from it. It's basically a glorified text document.
I mean, it works, but it's also not ideal.
If you could generate qr codes to publish signed transactions you might have something workable. It would resemble similar functionality to a Trezor or Ledger.

Maybe. It would transform the economy.
As of right now, the economy is all about growth. Growth growth growth! But what happens when growth can't happen anymore, or things slow down? We have decently big crashes. Then the market resumes... usually.
As for a deflationary currency economy, we would need products, goods and services that offer a higher quality than the expected returns of your money. This car that I purchase needs to justify me not getting 5% growth every year. My monthly fee on Netflix might turn into a one-time purchase for lifetime membership (Netflix holds the initial amount and withdraws 7% from it annually to pay for my subscription).
An economy can work this way, but it would rapidly change a lot of things. Instead of me needing to invest in things to combat my money losing value, I am incentivized to keep the money and it will grow on its own.
This could collapse things, but then again entire civilizations used gold as a currency for many years.
@_date: 2019-07-30 09:52:50
Seeing as the US "delivers Democracy" to countries that pair gold to their own currency, this seemed like it could never see the light of day.

The network is heavily clogged. This 2nd layer solution, lightning, will hopefully drop the price.
At some point, when lightning transactions are dirt cheap($0.00001), we can start to see businesses offer discounts, very much like how gas stations do with cash.
Credit cards give you cash back for two reasons:
* They're making the merchant pay a fee, and that fee gets split with you. If merchants get charged less via a Bitcoin transaction, savings might be passed to you.
* They sell your buying habits to data companies, which in turn sell your data to advertising firms to try and get you to buy stuff

Good thing I lost all my Bitcoin in a hack a few months ago.
@_date: 2019-07-04 10:22:28
I... Hope you set aside money for taxes...
And yeah, thinking you can trade because you got lucky once or twice does not mean you can keep winning.
I got lucky once. Once. Only once. So I kept most of my investment in BTC (sold enough to cover initial investment plus 50% profits over 3 years) and will let the rest ride. I took some profit, threw it into investment accounts on more traditional/conservative funds, and will let the remainder ride.
I win either way.

It was. It was a dramatic representation of what a newcomer might say, and why an exchange might be a reasonable place to store it until they figure out how to properly store it.

So did you recklessly out a ton of money into it, or are you dollar cost averaging out what you can afford.
Most of us are down. Hell, I've got a friend down $450,000 because he bought sub-100. He's still happy with his investments because he's been in it for the long run.
If you're gonna buy, make sure you can afford to lose it. If you can't, stop buying and consider selling to get back into good financial health through traditional investments routes (keep a small % in BTC)
I think you recognize the right ideas, but do you know WHY BTC is immutable? Or what makes it scarce? Many people use cookie cutter responses to say why they invest in it, but are so blinded by the greed of selling it for USD once it hits a certain price. That's like investing in Tesla for their car line so you can use the profits to buy a Toyota truck. There is an irony to be observed.
Maybe you should focus some energy into your Roth IRA for now.

You can encrypt it, and you can also disguise it in other things.
For example, get a book and circle each letter of your seed, in order. Put a fake signature on the cover of the book and put it in a plastic preservation case to make it look like it's a collectible. Chances are no one will open it.

But that's their choice.
This is decentralized. Agents can act in a harmful way and lose money, or they can cooperate and earn more money.
Wait until people start leaving those pools and move towards pools that do accept all transactions. I doubt a lot of people will remain loyal to a pool that denies them money making opportunities.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:56:41
Well, like the UASF, nodes will not accept blocks that don't adopt this soft fork, thus lowering the miners' chances of propagating their blocks.

Insurance policy. Only a matter of time before every government has "race to the bottom" to deflate their currency to solve tough choices. By keeping Bitcoin on the radar, you literally force the government's hand to not kill the value of their currency, because their citizens will devalue it faster than it can be printed. This is like employees sabotaging the company from the inside because management sucks.
Secondly, what happens when BTC becomes almost free to transact and does better as programmable, logical money? This isn't the money of the internet, but the internet of money. Credit cards can't stream payments, fight fraud by equating to either true/false, etc.


Make it easy, offer discounts, innovate, make it fun, etc.
Let's put it this way; if it goes to $100k you know a bunch of people are going to sell some investments to kill debts like student loans, housing debt, car debt, etc.


There will most likely be middleman holders of contracts, kinda like credit cards. You'll be able to agree upon a company to facilitate the transaction. It's got similar issues with cash right now. You sue if you don't get what you paid for.
What IS interesting is the ability to sign messages using a public key. You could have a company verify publicly that they own a key, "sign" a message that explains the details of the contract, then you pay to the contract. That would definitely make things easier in court and for public reputation. We just need more innovations in this.


Hope they helped.

I see no problem with Tether.

I'm so sick and tired of people hating on government organizations while expecting protections from said organizations.
If you sent $20,000 to Coinbase and they said "too bad so sad we aren't giving you the BTC", you'd be ready to call in the government to protect you in a heartbeat. What do you think funds this type of protection?
Also, would you be singing this same tune if megacorps were abusing crypto to avoid taxes?

I think you're assuming every cryptocurrency will have a guaranteed spot in the world. 99.9% of crypto will fail, just like a "it's like Facebook, but for left handed bowlers" social network clone.
If a coin solves a solution, it is probably going to succeed. If a coin exists because someone says "I like cars so let's make a coin to buy cars" or "Scandinavian people need their own coin", they're welcome to build the coin and try to deploy it, but it probably won't succeed.
We are seeing the .com bubble forming in the crypto space. Everyone is making a coin, and money is chasing these to try and snag the epic Bitcoin gains. Some are succeeding if they both buy and sell early enough.

Ya know, if you've been buying in regular increments over the past year, you'd be pretty damn happy.
So here's what you do. Take the amount you'd be okay with losing, and split it up into 10 portions. Every 35 days, buy with one of the ten portions, no matter the price.
This is called dollar cost averaging, and it helps spread out the risk.

See, I find it does the opposite.
Governments need to make sure their financial policy is solid and in the best interest of everyone, or else people will drop that currency faster than they can print it.
This keeps governments in check. If you want to inflate money by small amounts to stimulate economic growth, I'm all ears to hear the proposal. If you want to bail out banks for the third time because the government let the banks walk all over the laws, we can punish two entities at the same time; ineffective government, and banks.

The Turks know value. Gold is such a strong aspect of their savings. At weddings, gold is given to the newlyweds to start them off.

So you invest and hodl.
And when it kicks off again, you guilt trip them into thinking they talked you out of becoming a millionaire.

That's been the plan the whole time.
Got friends involved, had them buying in at the $2500 mark. They started FOMOing to try and get a full BTC. "If I could just have one whole Bitcoin I'd be happy. Having 0.6 BTC just isn't enough, but... my wife won't let me invest more/I don't have enough money/I can't gamble that much/I don't have that much spare money" was a similar story I'd hear many, many times.

@_date: 2019-07-05 21:49:31
They're selling you a nonrefundable asset. If someone's identity were stolen, and $10,000 BTC were purchased using a compromised bank account, the exchange selling the BTC might have the money reversed by the bank finding the purchase. They're not taking the risk of losing the crypto and being hit with a reversal, because they lose in the end.
Additionally, they are following laws based on money laundering and illegal activity with money. They want to attach money to identities to discourage illegal use. You won't launder $10,000,000 through an exchange if it's attached to your passport.
@_date: 2019-07-18 20:32:01
Yeah. If you add different values to the block of data, the hash output changes unpredictably. You want one with a certain # of leasing zeroes. That's the difficulty target.
So one easy way to keep guessing without changing much data is to just have one field to keep guessing numbers.

* If you buy GBTC and put it in your Roth IRA account, any exponential growth that happens becomes tax free
* Holding your own BTC, trusting exchanges, and dealing with all the maintenance is annoying. Why not just buy a stock that takes care of it all for you, and is insured by a trustworthy system?
These two factors help establish the premium cost associated with the shares.
Honestly, probably a good idea to toss a few into your Roth IRA.
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:04:34

Yes. They'll most likely send you fraudulent checks or transfers while expecting you to send them some BTC. The bank eventually removes the money from your account because it was fake.

Of course.

It makes sense, especially if citizens expect companies to remain solvent, then come back crying to the government about protections and whatnot.
Governments have the resources, bureaucracy, accountability, and other qualities necessary to handle currency. Facebook does not, especially when held accountable strictly to their shareholders instead of the entire country.
Bitcoin, however, does not owe anything to "shareholders".
@_date: 2019-07-25 05:35:31
I always find it funny how much energy they have to dismiss it. People go out of their ways to keep telling me to get out of it.

Most exchanges simply connect buyers to sellers and rarely hold any coins themselves. They just facilitate the "exchange".
While it is good to hold your own keys, it doesn't really impact the exchanges too much.
for those that are gambling with this, they are playing an extremely dangerous game. This is why larger, more reputable exchanges are probably worth keeping funds in if you decide to do so. Again I must echo that it is a great idea to hold your own private keys

Sure, let the coin get forked.
And see how quickly people dump the forked coins to buy more BTC. Happened with other forks. That's what I did. I dumped cash and SV to obtain more BTC.
Every time BTC forks on one of these situations, we get a more narrow view on what ideas of forks will actually be useful, and which ideas will get stomped flat into the ground. BCH has been sitting around 5% of BTC in terms of price, so that may tell you a lot about it.
In another 100 years, someone will probably revisit this idea for the 50th time, and researchers will have historic data that shows it didn't work then, and it probably won't work now.

So you can't just jump in and expect to be good at it.
You'll lose money. A lot of money.
The main idea of being a SUCCESSFUL day trader is to have extensive knowledge of the field, understand how news and breakthroughs actually impact the market, identify bad actors and avoid their influence, and use precise analytics to figure out what actually causes prices to rise and fall.
As others have said, it might be better to slowly invest in the field by buying crypto that you have researched. Set a budget and stick to it.
Also, day trading requites a good 8-10 hours of concentration on data and news. Be prepared to make crypto your full time job if you're gonna try day trading.
And the easiest target for day traders are those who think they can stand out above the rest, and can just jump right in. That's where day traders beat the average gains of the market, as the money has to come from somewhere.

No matter how much you learn about it, you'll never know what to do. Been learning since 2013 religiously. I'm more confused now than when I began learning about this stuff.

I agree fully, but newbies need to know:
* PC mining will not net anything, and yes this is true even if you have "a killer gaming rig"
* we don't know what the price will do, especially when everyone is in crisis mode
* No guarantees at all
* Get your coins off exchanges
A lot of the "newbies" that ask questions do so with a "but I'm special and I want you to tell me the 'secrets' that the experts really know so I can do that thing you said was unrealistic"
But I always take the time to educate on it, and often ask others to fact check me. Most newbies like it when you are a little tough and not soft on your corrections.
It's a tough balance to find.

I support taxation because of what it provides. However, I feel like there is a lot of waste. I'm always open to discuss making taxes go towards better things. Taxes maintain things like roads, law enforcement, education, etc.
Many people say that taxes are spent poorly, or in ways that benefit the lawmakers. They're not wrong. For example, a politician may push for taxes to fund a program that does laundry for the poor. What may happen is the politician may start a business that does laundry, does a crappy job, and charges 10x the amount they normally would, all while funneling tax money toward their own business. That's not cool.
When it comes to Bitcoin, I feel people only want to stop the benefits of taxes for if they become rich and have no need for safety nets provided by taxing. I think this is silly.
Keep learning! You seem to have an open mind and want to learn both sides, which is awesome.

Every time I hear a government decide they're "doing blockchain" I become suspicious that they are doing a test run to feel out the environment. In the end, they'll switch to an existing cryptocurrency because they were able to carefully test an environment first.

If it does crash, they'll refuse to buy it because they're afraid it'll go even lower.

In theory, yes. We could see a rather large lightning mesh network being built that adds centralization. However, they will always be incentivized to charge a cheap rate, as anyone could set up their own network of channels.


I don't see this happening, as everyone participating in the LN is encouraged via game theory to play fairly. You make more money by playing along with the system as opposed to trying to harm it.
And also, lightning is optional. You could just use the base layer of Bitcoin to do transactions.
@_date: 2019-07-08 17:43:18
That will happen in the year 2140.
By then, miners will rely on transaction fees to mine transactions and pay the bills.

You have people setting sell orders at 15k. But then some people want to sell at 14999.99 to lock in sales before the 15k sales happen. Then others put orders at 14999.98, 14999.97, etc.

A little extreme, but good thoughts.
Most young Americans today realize there are two options:
* Gamble in the stock market and encourage companies to erode the foundations of America through vicious profit obsession
* Save money in the bank and lose 1.5% of the value via inflation
Or, you could now put money into a non-profit system that is scarce, accepted as valuable among your peers, and has potential to eventually act as a currency.
Oh, and the price keeps going up, so anyone who invests early would see some serious profits for having faith in this system early. It's only a matter of time before people will instead want it simply because it can move from one person to another with almost zero friction.

Once the sale happens, you no longer own BTC.
However, Coinbase might try to serve their own interests by reversing that.

In Lightning, you lock money in limbo. It's eventually coming back to you after x days via a Bitcoin transaction.
However, in those x days you can adjust the payouts in a mathematically sound way. By the end of x days, you may have accumulated 300 different payments back and forth amongst yourselves. Tiny payments, big payments, refunds, warranty purchases, whatever. By the end of it, you've summarized all these transactions in a single Bitcoin transaction. You save on transaction fees.
Now, you can ALSO open these channels among several people... or hundreds... or thousands...
Now we have a mathematically safe system condensing millions of transactions into significantly fewer transactions. Each degree of complexity will charge a tiny fee, but it will be nothing in comparison to a transaction fee.
I'm excited for this technology. Please keep in mind this will not work flawlessly at first. We have a lot of work to do, but we will succeed.

Bitcoin is not guaranteed to be a 7 layer protocol. The internet is broken into 7 layers because of the complexity that arises from trying to diagnose/build a network communication system.
We will see layers, but some may be trivial. Layer 7 of the OSI 7 Layer Model is Application. Well, we already have a "top layer" for the application. Realize that each aspect of Bitcoin will be broken down into layers. Here are a few:
* Blockchain layer - stores the credentials for who has how much
* Signing layer - This layer is what happens when a user signs a transaction and places it on the network
* Mining Layer - This is where the signed messages are bundled into transactions to be added to the blockchain
* Node Mempool/Verification Layer - This is where nodes hold the mempool for miners, and once a block is mined, it is sent back to nodes for verification and propagation
* Application Layer - This is where a software or hardware wallet keeps the private keys and signs messages
These are not in logical order BTW
Long story short, Bitcoin will most likely NOT be using a vertical tower of layers. It will be a flowchart-based layer with many directions, including back and forth movement as the transaction moves across each layer. You would send a transaction from the application layer to the node, which goes to the miner, which gets processed and then sent BACK to the node, which is then moved back to the application layer.
TL;DR: 
Shit's complicated, yo.

This. I have friends who don't know what they want. Or, rather, they want someone to come along and guarantee the price. No risk, but rather an exchange coming along and saying "but it today at $14k and we guarantee you'll be able to sell it at $15k next week".

I dislike BCH quite a bit. However, I'm not going to run around and tell people what to think. If asked, I'll gladly give my side, especially to beginners.
You can't run around flexing authority on which is the "true" Bitcoin. Instead be informed on each side and present your logical conclusions.
BCH wants big blocks, which is fine as a temporary solution. I use that as an opportunity to explain the role of nodes and how bigger block sizes means bigger storage requirements. I see the end game of node management becoming a corporate "service", and explain how more fees will be introduced into the system. No one will want to add 1TB of storage to their node monthly without expecting a financial incentive. Or, it will cost money just to propagate a transaction. Expect accounts, control, "verified receiving addresses", etc. This is trying to bootstrap Bitcoin to a corporate model, and I hope it doesn't go that way. This will maybe scale to "once per month" transactions among the whole population.
With second layer scaling solutions, you summarize transactions and allow for micropayments, larger scaling, network participation, and a lot more. The counterargument against "it's not on the blockchain" is defeated by the fact that I owed a friend $50, he owed another friend $50, so I just paid the third guy in BTC. Our debts weren't properly recorded either, and it doesn't really matter. The thing that does matter is the number of Bitcoin didn't change, and transactions kept and justified the finite supply at all given times.
I could go on for pages and pages. I made my investments accordingly, and I have both coins. I'm heavier towards one side, and I'm okay with my investment risks. I just hope everyone else is, too.

There's a technique called "dollar cost averaging". You eliminate the "cheap opportunities" by trading them for the safety of averaging the cost over set intervals of time.
Buy once every 8 days, at a set amount you find good. That way after 7 purchase cycles, you've bought on each day of the week, in case there was a trend of a certain day of the week being a high price day, on average.

Are you buying Bitcoin without doing research? If so, there will be price drops and you won't know if the drop is from authentic bad news or manipulation or whatever else.
Secondly, if you're just buying it to get rich you may want to actually learn WHY this stuff is so valuable. [I made a site]( that teaches you the basics from the ground up. You should do some research.
No one knows what the price will do. Bitcoin may go to $100 each tomorrow. I certainly hope you're prepared for such a situation.

Oh, I get it. Lightning is supposed to be our savior. Once lightning happens, we'll have ZERO fees.
Building a payment network takes a VERY long time. We won't simply activate Lightning Network and have $0.0001 fees. That will take a while to build.
As with every technology, the utility designs the function. Bitcoin might work out well for the 4 billion unbanked, but it also might not.
Right now, it doesn't work. Telling people "just wait until Segwit... then wait until Lightning... then let us test it for 6 months... then let the network grow... then let the true transaction price be discovered by 7 months of a free market... then let Lightning exist before taking the risk" isn't helping them now.
The Bitcoin network is amazing, but we're quickly seeing the immediate utility define the function of the network. In time we will get Lightning, but constantly posting "Lightning will save us" doesn't help much at the moment.

Coinbase claims to have your coins insured if you keep them on their exchange. I am not 100% convinced that guarantee will be held.

If all of the miners decided to stop making money, it would certainly slow down the network. However, I'd be firing up my old mining rigs and try to pull in as much BTC as I could, as the profit incentive would be enormous.
Funny thing is, mining has become so cutthroat, miners cannot afford to stop earning money. The game theory system running right now basically keeps all miners at tight competition with each other that they would see HUGE incentives to mine behind each others backs.
Also, you would have to convince the participants in mining pools to give up their profits as well. Good luck convincing people to stop earning money.
This is one step closer to pure capitalism that keeps things in check.

That's like saying your ISP free email account is the end-game of the internet. The true innovation happens when anyone can innovate on the edge and not seek permission from the big companies.


Cash is used quite a bit. Being simple, anonymous and frictionless is valuable. You can't buy things from me via credit card without me accepting the Visa terms and agreements. Venmo will eventually switch to a transaction fee system.


Show me a free card that gives 4% or more cash back every day and I'll sign up for that card today.
As for the blockchain, you wouldn't be able to tap into it without their permission. I want to be able to tap into a blockchain without permission, guidelines, developer fees, etc.
Credit cards cannot make fees as low as Bitcoin fees in a sufficiently optimized scenario because banks want profits. Bitcoin is a truly non-profit bank system that works globally.


I don't need that if I'm the only authorized user to use my Bitcoin wallet. Credit card theft exists because you're literally using the password for the account in the open, for all to see. In Europe they use chip &amp; pin, and a lot less fraud happens as a result. In the US, it is more profitable to avoid using the link because it means more profits for credit card companies, as forgetting your pin means you can't buy anything. The fraud prevention is just the cost of doing business.

Alice owes Chris .1 BTC. Alice has a lightning channel with Bob open and Bob has a lightning channel with Chris.
Alice can announce a "hop" to Chris where she sends .1001 btc to Bob, but that transaction only works if Bob can prove he signed a message giving .1 BTC to Chris. In fact, Alice gives Chris info where Chris has the secret key to unlocking Alice's transaction over to Bob, so now Bob's receiving of money plus a fee is dependent on Chris trading it for 0.1 btc. Bob keeps .0001 BTC as a fee for doing his work as a middleman.

I too find it funny how the closer we get to milestones such as Segwit, Lightning test network, one wallet going live, etc., we realize how much more we need to go, blind Lightning followers exclaim how it will turbocharge the network on day 1. We're probably at the very least 6 months away from having it running on platforms that only skilled users will touch. Hell, Coinbase still doesn't have Segwit addresses...
Lightning is definitely going to fix things, but if you tell people "any day now" for 2 years, they stop listening to you as a credible source... just like how countless news companies have declared Bitcoin as dead.
I am 100% in support of Lightning, and it will definitely address scaling issues. However, this is still going to take a long time to fulfill the prediction. I was told countless times that the second we got Segwit implemented, Lightning was merely weeks away. I think Segwit happened this summer? It's December now.

I think this is what's going to help the world discover some philosophical truths.
You can literally maintain decentralized banking by participating. If everyone does it, it keeps corrupt institutions more honest. Instead of subscribing to a money service, you code the laws of money into decentralized software and have businesses build on top of that. Instead of money being this thing that can be reshaped and/or altered by a bunch of people with selfish motivations, we can now reshape and alter it so it fits the needs of the overwhelming majority of participants.
Banks can pretty much do the same thing they're doing now, except this time without the ability to manipulate and control the root essence of money.
Banks now need to offer me a service and/or incentive for my cooperation, and this time around they won't be able to change the rules of the thing they hold for me. I can just as safely and easily maintain my own money, and maybe even do more as this currency develops.

Begging for money is the same no matter what community or topic you discuss. People are begging here because they know some lucky users have a TON of money.
I had someone who was begging me, assuming I had thousands of bitcoins around because I understood how mining worked. Once I clarified that I had significantly less than he was begging for (0.5 BTC), he ignored me completely when I offered to help clarify any questions.
People are going to beg and plead and do everything they can now because Bitcoin is seen as "worth a lot of money". It's best to ignore such requests and also avoid letting people know how much BTC you have, because when begging doesn't work, stealing your identity/account credentials/social engineering will be their next tool.
Some people do need help, but they shouldn't be here. There are subreddits for that.

I'm assuming more investors will want to research Bitcoin when a futures market opens. This in turn will give a lot more people reasons to do deeper research about what Bitcoin is and how it works. If 1 in every 10 researchers have an "aha" moment about how it works and what makes it so special, that's a large number of wealthy people thinking "I need to own some of this outside of my work portfolio".

Interesting point
Wealth was made by manipulating the financial system. Bitcoin is reallocating value to an unbiased system that can't be games as easily.
Those that made wealth in the old system are too afraid to take the risk in a new one. They wouldn't dare bet against the system that made them rich.
But those who dislike the gamed system are leaving for a more fair system because they either have nothing, or realize how futile it is to struggle in the gamed system.

Step 1: secretly acquire lots of Bitcoin.
Step 2: teach your government everything about crypto by having them do a mock project that's born to fail.

Public Key: You give this out to receive Bitcoin. Much like you give out your email address for people to send you emails.
Private Key: This is essentially the password for your account. It is used to initiate the sending of Bitcoin to Public Keys. Much like your email password, you do not want people to have access to this.
Seed: This is a 12 or 24 word passphrase that directly translates to your private key. This is much easier to remember and/or write down than something like nK83fnosOGHOUfnfo68GfGFbkwKUGb3bObflsjbew3njKjfhsv8jBRj if instead it mapped out to CAT DOG HAMPER DEVIL PRODUCT COFFEE DOG CONTRACT WEB VOLUME WORDY COMMUNISM.

As with every free market, you have people who want to own something.
I have a thing. I paid $5 for this thing last year and I really like it. You want my thing. You offer me $5, but I refuse, as I want this thing. So you offer me $6 for this thing. I still refuse and say it will cost you $10 for me to part with my thing. You decide that you will offer me $9 and I accept. The value we have both agreed for this thing is $9.
Now imagine that in an entire room full of people. There are people agreeing to buy or sell a thing at different prices. Some smart people realize they can buy a thing at $7 and turn around to immediately sell it at $9 to people. After enough buying/selling of things, all the buyers and sellers have met a happy medium. We now see that no one will buy the thing at $9 and no one will sell their thing for $7. At this point, most people believe that the thing is worth around $8, because when it is cheaper people will buy it, but if it is more expensive, no one will buy it.
Now we learn that this thing can help people with a common task in their lives, or it has a cultural value, or some rich guy is buying as many things as he can.
Now nobody wants to part with their thing, until someone comes around and starts offering more money for the thing. It is now selling at $10 because so many people believe this thing might do more in the future, or maybe these things will be scarce and they won't be able to find them for under $20 in another year.
This is the barebones basics of how price is discovered.

It isn't the responsibility for them to portray Bitcoin in a way you find fitting.
Back in the 90s, there was an episode of Cheers. In that episode, a character was a computer nerd, and they portrayed him as "he can speak with computers, and the computers tell him what sports team to bet on". Again, crappy portrayal of technology before it kicked off.
It was bound to be a crappy episode. You can't offer mainstream entertainment while accurately discussing a technology within a sitcom plot.
Thing is, the audience has now heard of it. They are now more than likely to associate Bitcoin with value, and some of them will go down the rabbit hole to figure out what this stuff is and how it works, especially if they're as "nerdy" as the show makes them want to be.

If two different blocks were "mined" at the same time, both might exist as the "newest block". So there's a race to see who can build the next newest block on top of the one they think is the winner. Whichever block has a new one built ontop of it becomes the winner.
So you want to wait for 3 confirmations for smaller stuff, or 6 confirmations for big stuff. The likelihood of there being 1 tie is decent, another tie after is weird but happens. 3 confirmations is very strange. 6 is damn near impossible when you calculate the odds.

Fees should lower when there is less demand for transactions to go through.

Posted this a while back:
When people tell you what to do with your bitcoin, pretend to follow their advice.
"Wow thanks Dad, I sold at $12k, thanks for being the voice of reason"
And then in a month when it hits $14k, ask him what the hell happened. Same at 16k, 20k, etc. Get increasingly frustrated with them as the price keeps going up and up. Keep demanding links to their research. The goal is to push the assumption that they did enough research to justify giving you advice.
When they genuinely feel bad, tell them you didn't sell, and you want it to be a lesson in telling other people what to do with their money, especially when they have no knowledge of that particular thing.

Your advice implies that people should get into one of the most speculative and volatile markets to... DAY TRADE!?!?!?

I am speaking from both sides to present the realistic approach. Lightning will eventually work, and it'll probably work well. People who support it need to realize that by promising results upfront will harm the reputation and sophistication of implementing a solution.
This is going to be extremely difficult to pull off. I take both sides because I see both the promise it brings, and a realistic scope of when that promise will be fulfilled.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:02:20
Assuming equal distribution, yes.
So the general idea is that as population goes up, demand for BTC goes up, and as a result there is less to go around.
I think the biggest benefit is that you no loner need to invest your money if you don't want to, you could simply hold onto your BTC and as long as demand keeps increasing, you become wealthier.
We're back to the gold standard.

I've had the financial goal of selling 10% of my existing bitcoin every time it grows tenfold in power from $500. That way I keep a decent chunk of it, but still sell in case the price does flop at some point. It also gives me a return on my original investment the first time it grows tenfold from $500.
Edit: and the "money" I sell it for will be immediately invested into some long term stocks. Who knows, I might be buying stocks directly with bitcoin...
Edit 2: after seven tenfolds, I will have a little less than half of my initial bitcoin. This means bitcoin would be worth 10,000,000 times what it is now. Shouldn't be an issue if I sacrifice half for "checkpoints" at each milestone.

Yeah, but if the hashrate percentage is lower than the market cap if a similar coin with near-identical mining algorithm, we see a shifted ratio of hashrate to market cap. That's where manipulation can happen.

No single event will turbocharge the price like we dream of. We hold this whole fantasy of "bitcoin is $100000 a coin haha you didn't invest when we were telling you". Maybe a few perfectly timed events could help a price double a few times, but we probably won't ever see a 100-fold growth overnight. We would have too many people selling for a correction, especially someone who invested something like $5000 turning it into $50000. I personally know that if bitcoin hits 10x my investment, I'll sell 10% of my bitcoin to make the other 90% free to me. From there, it really depends on my financial situation if I would sell more.

Refer to the internet. I have a message forum I set up for about 20 friends. I'm sure a similar argument was made for making a website for such a small amount of people when news stations clearly do a better job.
As for free credit card use, gas stations give discounts when you pay with cash. Same logic would apply.
What would convince the average person to use crypto? How about a 5% discount and a rewards program that uses blockchain references for tracking orders?




Sure, that's really nice. Credit cards aren't cash though.


Gas station gives me more than 4% discount for paying in cash, and most cards don't give that type of cash back bonus (aside from moments where they give it for a month or two to get me into the habit of using the card regularly)


Like when someone steals your credit card and spends it? I put a pin on my mycellium wallet and it protects that can of worms from every being opened. As for situations with chargebacks, you could build a multisig wallet where a third party can verify the situation. Thing is, we could do a lot more than leaving it in the hands of the same company controlling the financial exchange.


I can lose my phone right now and nothing happens. I have my backup keys securely stored.


Warranties are now attached to the blockchain. A company provides their receiving address, and signs a message with the terms of the warranty. Also, the tech is only 8 years old. These solutions will be developed. The other rewards are from the merchant fees attached to the card, and the selling of user data.


I can still take loans and build credit. Car loan, credit cards where I use crypto to pay the monthly bill, etc.


Give it time. I'm confident these things will develop over time.


How do businesses convince people to pay in cash? Find a healthy, mutually beneficial medium where you both win on your terms, as opposed to the credit card company strong arming the terms and conditions once they gain market dominance.
You're acting like the credit card industry could never lose influence in the world, ever. If that's the case, put your money where your mouth is and invest in them for long-term gains. It's a surefire win according to your assessment.
People have said:
* The internet will never replace printed press
* The internet will never replace phone communication
* The internet will never replace mail
* The internet will never replace faxes
* The internet will never replace television and media exchange
And in almost every situation, the internet took web-based platforms and dropped them on an exponential growth track, and by the time the web version matched what it was competing with over x years, the exponential momentum took it to an order of magnitude greater every cycle of x years afterwards.
And now the internet will never replace money? Well, let's see what happens. I know where I'm placing bets.

Who gets to decide the threshold? If I could invest in coins before approving them into CMC, I increase awareness after I've invested, thus moving the price (most likely). Or if a coin competes (and is more efficient/decentralized/has more buzz words) with something I'm invested in, I'd be inclined to deny that entry into a pricing site.
You could calculate it yourself, keeping the coins you want. Cmc has a free API. I'll gladly give you my program that pulls the API and you can exclude any coins you like yourself if you'd like. Pulling data is extremely easy if you can understand indexing of lists.

Open for all. Let the market decide the winners; not someone who makes one of many ways to reduce friction between currencies.
You want a free market so true prices are discovered instead of manipulated. If someone gets in the way by being biased, you run the risk of being deceived.
If every crypto works on this system and is run unbiased, you acquire more wealth/value for choosing the right cryptos for the right reasons.
Just saying.

If a country decides to inflate their money, it will likely balance it out by the currency declining by as much value globally.
Except this time, citizens of that country can choose to invest their money outside the country with ease. If the government decides to hyperinflate, they have one shot at doing so because citizens will dump that money faster than they can print it.
People will probably keep some savings in Bitcoin, and I hope that 1BTC becomes the "millionaire" emotional figure to have.

I teach Bitcoin to help people understand where money might go.
But the biggest pitch I give everyone is "Bitcoin is a newer application of cryptography, and we're early enough in the development to take it apart, piece by piece. By learning about it now, you can actually see barebones cryptography being applied to a system not yet fully developed. In 5 years Bitcoin will be so complex that you won't be able to learn about the entire network anymore due to extremely complex applications."
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:51:37
You're assuming today's inefficiencies will be permanent.
At some point Bitcoin will find ways into society. Many people will buy it to use it as a universal currency, especially for vacation.

If you want to get rich in a manner unproportional to your investment, you need to take on risk. No one got rich quick by investing in safe investments. They may have gotten rich slowly by investing for long term (which is a viable strategy that should be used for a majority of your investments), but you can't expect crypto to grow fast, show you all the patterns, and still have enough room for growth to make you rich. This is why my advice is for people to invest what they can afford to lose, and to stop caring about what happens to it. Ride it to the moon or to the ground, pull out if your profit is too good to be true if you like, but don't sell it at a loss, as you should already expect that money to be out of your life.

Neither does a cash transaction. But that's what gets used often.
You can loosely connect where money goes, so you could see a set of 25 similar payments to an address, or you confiscate a phone and you can see where every single transaction went to. Then, if one of those addresses was moved to a coinbase account to turn into fiat, coinbase has said records of who signed up, identity verified and all.

@_date: 2018-05-25 14:13:15


Arguably, yes


I'm not sure what they're doing honestly. If all of a sudden the world moved from gasoline fuel to maple syrup fuel, I imagine we'd still find those that use traditional methods, no matter how inefficient. It costs money to implement changes. You don't just flip a switch, especially when your operation needs to be up and running every second of every day. You build in parallel and test the crap out of it until you're confident the transition works smoothly.


See my above response


To me it does. No one is in charge, and developments come out of vetted debate and research. No single person can snap their fingers and make a change happen.
Also, nothing is decentralized 100%. We appoint at least a tiny bit of authority to devs, speakers, companies, etc. Centralization/Decentralization is more of a spectrum.


Sure, but once I see a trusted developer take money and implement something that is nowhere near what I wanted, I stop trusting them. Their code is also open source, so we can inspect every line of code to make sure they aren't doing anything funny. People on the internet LOVE to call out BS.


Do you take $10 upfront, or possibly have a lifelong career with worldwide recognition? In 5 years you might be able to give a speech for 100 $10 bills.


Because reasons.


It's one of many ways. Honestly, lots of centralized systems have worked out fine, like Google, Facebook, etc. We're only seeing the truth now that they have their own motivations and those might be bad for us.

Same applies to databases that are never supposed to have deleted or edited records like Wikipedia, government public records, and banking data.


I agree 100%. Bitcoin is not just a database. It has database qualities, along with many many other qualities from many other technologies. And it uses them effectively. But I would still say it qualifies as a database, kinda like how a smartphone is way beyond a "phone", but still a phone.

Nope. My current investment strategy is to have the bitcoin pay for themselves when they hit around 15 times the original price I dumped into it, because that's all I was really willing to invest in anyway, so 14/15 of my investment still hits the moon.

While true, it is a huge step towards reducing payment system fees. Cash is annoying at times, but stores still love it because it is cheaper. I think this 1% fee will get more stores involved.
Then another startup sees that companies are charging 1%. Why not do 0.5% and do it more efficiently? Now we have competition. Once companies are involved in this process, we will see fees hit a fair price in time. 0.4%, 0.3%, 0.1%, and we'll see how low a payment system can truly get.
Thing is, how do we convince people to avoid point systems? The best bet is a discount, similar to a cash discount. Or maybe improving customer tier rewards? Buy with crypto 1-3 times per month, get a 1% discount. But 4-10 times, 2% discount, 10-50 times, 3% discount, 51+ times, 5% discount. Since this is all through lightning channels, you could have the software retroactively apply the discounts to all previous purchases and refund some of the money back. Idk, just rambling off ideas.
@_date: 2018-08-06 17:59:51

People want to buy Bitcoin after it has gone up a bunch and they feel like they've missed out. Then they'll get around to it. Then they regret not getting in when they could.

What if you found a healthy medium ground, such as agreeing to match Bitcoin investments with a college savings fund? Try to approach them as adults about this. Do your research, educate them on the topic, and give reasons why you want to invest.

It's super early in the morning so my math could be wrong, but here's what I cranked out:
15,000,000 bitcoin, let's try distributing 1 btc to each of 15,000,000 people.
7,000,000,000 people
15,000,000/7,000,000,000 = 0.0021x100=0.21% of the population could have one bitcoin.
If you have one bitcoin, you are guaranteed to have more ~~money~~ bitcoin than 99.79% of the earth's population.
If bitcoin becomes the only currency used, you would be part of the 1%.
For me, that's a gamble I'd be willing to take at $430.
Edit: Scaled up to the 21 million, owning one bitcoin puts you at having more bitcoin than 0.3% of the current population.

Maybe not specifically with BTC, but yeah these things happen all around the world. Turkey has some issues with corruption, crime and poverty. It is unfortunate for the good people living there.


It depends. Sometimes with big lottery winners, their families are kidnapped and held ransom. Anytime there is a lot of value, you risk crime being done. The bigger the incentive, the bigger the likeliness of someone to consider doing a crime, and the severity of the crime increases with the amount of money.

Because data is the new oil. You can find insights and build business models from that.
If Bitcoin gains more utilization, there will be a huge desire to understand where money goes. If you can identify the path of the Bitcoin from your sale forward (and you keep it a secret), you can sell precious data for marketing and advertising.
Exchanges will be profitable, but the data will be just as valuable, especially if regulation makes exchanges significantly less profitable in the future. Why not build and test your data analytics now so you're prepared when the inevitable happens?

The task is involved with something called the sha256 algorithm. Basically, you can plug any amount of data into it, and it gives an output of fixed length.
The goal is to put all the transactions into this algorithm and hope it churns out a certain number of leading zeros. If it doesn't, you can change a small section in the bundled texts that change the output dramatically. It's a lottery where the winner is often whoever can do trial and error the fastest.
The sha256 algorithm is open source and anyone can look at it.


There's a system built into the code that adjusts the difficulty based on how fast people "win" a block. If they are winning too fast, the difficulty goes up. If it's slowing down, difficulty drops.
This adjusts every 2 weeks or so.


It is possible to change the rules. Thing is, you need an overwhelming majority to agree on it. This is why there was a "fork" into Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin core.
If you had bitcoin before the fork, you have coins on both sides. But we can see that one coin is much more valuable than others.
If someone wanted to change the max supply of Bitcoin, I expect that most people would not agree to it. One of the defining characteristics of Bitcoin is limited supply of a digital item.

Fair points. I find it easier to tell someone to buy $100 worth now just to get some skin in the game. Much easier than saying "you should buy 0.0x BTC".
[I'm very aware of distribution of Satoshi per person on Earth]( and think that's a great follow up discussion, but you have to define BTC in terms that people understand initially.


That's lesson 2. I always tell people to invest their mind into the space before significant money, but again they need to have skin in the game to be motivated to learn. Seeing your money jump from $100 to 93 to 85 to 110 to 98 to 125 to 101 is something that gets them curious about this stuff.

But there will be no inflation. They can offer fractional reserve systems but a bank run would literally kill them. No bail outs through inflation means they can't be reckless without consequences.

@_date: 2018-05-24 14:33:18
You... don't want the banking system to collapse.
Everything will grind to a halt, including electricity, internet, rules of society, etc. and your Bitcoin won't work. In fact, if you expect the banking industry to collapse, better stock up on water, food, ammo and a shelter.
Can't pay workers, can't have basic societal infrastructure, can't have law, can't have exchange of money for goods and services. This spells chaos.
What we want is the slow decline of banks in terms of relevance and power. Too abrupt of a collapse would cause all governments to flex their muscles on this stuff and make it illegal for the common person to own crypto while secretly building their own reserves and allowing the well-connected rich to do so as well.
Slow declines are much better because no one sees it coming until a good 30% of the country has integrated this into daily use. Then you can't outlaw it as you could collapse (or badly injure) the economy. When people don't need a bank to operate in day to day life, banks must actually offer a service instead of squatting on laws and rules/regulations. Again, this needs to happen slowly.
Banking will hopefully evolve. Or, at least the smaller banks will be able to take on this kind of risky change to business operations without overturning their entire business model. Shareholders for massive banks will require them to continue making profits as normal while they must consume from within slowly. CEOs will pass radical changes in banks to keep profits up, then leave as the shit hits the fan, only for a more sociopathic CEO to step in and do twice the damage. They're trapped in promising more and more profits to shareholders until their model becomes unsustainable. See cable companies fighting against internet entertainment as reference.
You want slow integration, just like the cable companies did. They were more than happy to offer internet, and only now do they see chipping away at their profits when customers increasingly say "no thanks" to cable packages since internet can provide entertainment. And at this point, it is way too late for cable companies to stop offering internet because it makes such a big chunk of their profits. Their shareholders won't allow them to drop profits to maintain a stronghold over an ancient medium of entertainment, so they're stuck offering the very service that kills their profit models.

Whether it is the intention of banks or not, it is incredibly inconvenient and gives a wonderful use case for cryptocurrency. Although if you bought from an exchange that identified you, expect questioning from law enforcement if you do something sketchy.
This is unavoidable (for now), and is definitely going to be something criminals will use to circumvent law enforcement.

Bitcoins are about $7500 each. That may be out of your budget? Good news is that you can buy fractions of a Bitcoin.
Sign up for an exchange, such as Coinbase or Gemini. Those will sell you Bitcoin.
From there, your brother needs to have a wallet app set up on his smartphone AND BACKED UP, or he could lose it all if his phone dies on him. When he gets the wallet and backs up the phrase that controls his wallet, you can then send the Bitcoin to his wallet and he would be in control of it and own it.
Just a fair warning, if he loses access to the wallet by losing the backup and his phone access, the Bitcoin is gone FOREVER. There is no 1-800 number to call to reset his account, no refunds to be processed, NOTHING. It is impossible to use the Bitcoin without that access.
Alternatively, you could move the Bitcoin from an exchange to what's known as a paper wallet. This is paper with the access codes printed on it, secured.
It seems like you need to do some research though, or you could lose access and waste money in the process.

An airplane has sensors that report data to the internet. That data can predict emergency maintenance and schedule the maintenance when the plane lands, thus having technicians and the proper tools on hand. Faster repairs means faster flights, and as a result, more resources saved. The "big data" from analyzing thousands of plans every hour helps build predictive systems that help out in the long-run.
Same applies to your home. You could see how much water or heating resources you use in comparison to similar homes to see if your furnace isn't working efficiently.

While true, I can avoid crashes and fraud in this scenario.
By owning and managing my own Bitcoin, a "crash" would likely be due to fractional reserve crypto having a bank run. When they can't deliver, we will see a huge spike in demand because if they do 2x fractional reserve, we have 2x the normal demand, but it'll probably be the standard 10x.

I really don't like these points people are trying to make. Investors usually corner a specific area for their investment strategies. Maybe some institutions and investors should have seen it coming, but they should have also seen gold creep up in value over the years. Can't knock them for not participating in it.
As with Bitcoin, it's a black swan, and no one could have seen the level of success it generated over the decade. There is no specialized investor or institution aside from the little guys making tons of money.
Now, once we start to have exchanges and acceptance that crypto works, we will have specialized institutions.
We're knocking these institutions for not participating because they don't know enough about the topic.
Instead of trying to say "SEE HOW WRONG THEY ARE HAHAHA", put your energy into developing the crypto ecosystem. It needs a lot of work, and when people spend more time gloating about how right they are instead of taking actions to advance the technology, I can see why people call it a bubble. The advocates, participants, and even companies are focusing on the fact that they were right in the past instead of moving forward. That tells me these companies still aren't convinced of the value, so they refuse to participate currently.
We all win when these companies believe there is value in crypto.

One argument is to increase block size so it can hold more transactions. This might be an option someday as long as scaling the size of blocks allows everyone to participate. The criticism against this is if blocks are too big, it becomes much more difficult for people to run a node, which keeps the entire history of transactions.
Another solution is to add another settlement layer on top of the original. In this scenario, the lightning network is a possible solution. In this system, you have multiple people (thousands) all doing transactions through this layer, and at the end of cryptographically secured routing channels, the payments are settled by several complex transactions. By participating as part of this routing network, a user can earn tiny, tiny rewards. The criticism of this is the level of complexity and possibility for channels to shut down en masse, which could cripple Bitcoin.
Both are possible ways to improve Bitcoin. Both will probably be used in one way or another. I'm leaving it up to you to do some more research and come to your own conclusions. Don't trust everyone yelling their opinion at you.

Cheaper transactions, paves the way for a layer 2 solution which could vastly increase the capability of the network


Segwit fees are lower. You pay more per transaction. The more people that use the network, the higher the fees. Segwit lowers clogging of transactions when more people want to get a transaction in.


You could do such a thing, but the basic idea still holds that only your private keys can sign transactions.


As you should be. Always question everything until you are satisfied.


It isn't forceful in any way actually. You can still use legacy wallets, but don't come complaining to me when transaction fees are too high for your tastes.


You are more than welcome to do this. In fact, if you decide to not spend your Bitcoin under Segwit, and things go south, you'd probably be safe if we HAD to rewind the blockchain and fork it from when the issue happened. You'd still have your Bitcoin in this scenario


Sounds about right.


Nothing was "wrong" really, and your questioning was fine. The only wrong thing to do is blindly follow what others tell you without thinking about it yourself and researching about it


Forks are a way, but in this scenario, the majority of users wanted Segwit. Those that didn't were welcome to fork Bitcoin and implement their own rules. If they get enough followers and supporters, the fork is valid as a new coin. If said followers/supporters overwhelm the Segwit group, that would probably gain some recognition as the "real Bitcoin".

I could edit my transactions by going back to the block with my transaction and apply an absurd amount of mining power to outpace the current block height, changing where the funds go.
Same goes for deleting, if I choose to opt out of including a specific transaction.
In both cases, I have edited and deleted the database, and theoretically I could rewrite everything else that has been done.
Extremely unlikely to do, but it can be argued as being done to the database.
Just like you can't delete Wikipedia entries unless you delete all archived versions of Wikipedia everyone has ever stored. You just alter the most commonly accessed version of the database.
What we have with the blockchain is a perma-database, or at least one that is near permanent and can only be moved forward by conventional means. To edit or delete would require massive consensus.
Kind of interesting to think of it this way.

A 1% jump on bitcoin breaking 4 digits again makes sense. Bitcoin gets a ton of advertising on the $1000 break, so more people will most likely buy into it right there. If it bumps it to $1050, that's a 5% profit day trade (4% with fees and exchange rates and whatnot)

Sure, but then when a CEO, who understands the math and realizes just how secure their pin system works, hears something like this he won't take him seriously.
It would be easier to explain how you can lock money into an account and require the computing power of the entire earth running for the life of Earth to put a scratch in brute forcing a single wallet password. This is not only accurate, but also explains the level of security even further. Or, even begin with "let's say a hacker has a card number and was able to brute force a card PIN. A million guesses could be done overnight. A Bitcoin wallet couldn't be brute forced in a billion years.
It explains the concept much better and has a more truthful explanation.

Same thing happened as it flirted with $650 for a long time. Once it locked that price area, the price went up after it "felt safe".

Honestly, it is luck. There's no guarantee Bitcoin will explode in value. It seems likely, but I'm not betting my life savings on it. There is also the luck factor that you heard of it before most. Learning about it when BTC is $200 is much more different than learning about it at $775
@_date: 2017-02-08 11:35:59
And don't think "it won't happen to me, I'll take my Bitcoin out before the bad news hits". You could lose your money overnight.
Or, let's say Bitcoin goes to $10,000 each. You can expect a company to all of a sudden "find suspicious activity" with your account, seize your funds, and put you through years of expensive legal battles you simply cannot win.
Just save yourself the time and take them out of the exchange.

It's an easy way to evoke emotions in the decision making process.
Many people see bitcoin as "the one and only", so an alternative coin seems weird.
Bitcoin is just as much technology as it is social interpretation. People believe in the tech, they just don't see the seemingly infinite potential with a currency that can update, scale, and import new features as needed.

We as humans LOVE scarcity. Almost everyone I know admits "I should get some Bitcoin to hold onto" but no one ever does it. I tell them at some point, owning a single Bitcoin will be a goal obtained throughout one's entire life. They don't believe me.
@_date: 2016-03-13 13:35:43
So many business models use the following steps:
-make the service too good to be true
-make the service free but charge for extra features
-once people are dependent on your services, slowly extract the convenience to make more profits
-slowly start charging for all the features you were giving away for free, by this point itbis so integrated into the ecosystem that people CAN'T not use it
That's about when disruptive technologies enter the battlefield and the pattern starts all over again.
The only difference is that bitcoin doesn't care to make money for its shareholders, it simply wants to perpetuate itself.

No matter how you look at it, bitcoin would fluctuate in value. That .334 bitcoin you just paid to your electric bill now buys half as much next month, but your job won't pay you twice as much.
We're stuck on dollars because they help quantify almost everything. It will take a lot of work to think of things in bits, especially this early in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-27 11:59:49
This is dumb. Bank cards usually have a "3 attempts and the ATM eats your card" security system. Having a 0.3% chance of your card's pin being guessed is not bad, especially since the bank covers you on fraudulent charges anyways.
Doesn't matter if a million people have the same pin number as me, because that means a billion people DON'T have the same password as me.
This is just "light tech talk" that gets people to think Bitcoin is more secure because a 6 digit PIN is insecure, but that's just like a car salesman trying to sell you a better warranty because Honda's warranty doesn't cover your car stereo after 4 years.

Once it becomes easier to buy, especially by just saying "financial advisor, please purchase some Bitcoin", we'll see price go up. In turn, that will cause more and more to want to buy it. Feedback loops all the way to a bubble popping, and we'll probably see $1500 each. Then another slow trickle up, and the process will repeat for a while.

I've restored to letting people make their claims.
I had a co-worker who would shit all over me for buying Bitcoin back when it was $250 after the second wave crash from $650ish. He kept going on about how I'd lose everything. Then it was $400. Then $660. Then $770, $850, $975, $1000, $1100, and then $1200. Now he's butthurt about not getting in on such a cheap price.
He still "knows" it's going to crash again. I think he hopes this will happen so he can buy it at the all time low, but he'll also be too big of a wimp to take a risk. He's always going to hate on it because he didn't get exclusive privilege to buy it at a "guaranteed low" that can only be guaranteed in hindsight. People get upset because they're too afraid to take a risk, and would rather no one be allowed to partake in something that they're afraid to do.
@_date: 2017-02-07 01:12:28
Access is a big factor. I have friends who want to buy Bitcoin, but I tell them to learn how to secure it on their own wallet first. This involves at least 2-3 hours of research to make sure they don't get screwed over holding Bitcoin in an exchange.
It quickly turns into an "I'll do it next week" kind of situation.

We don't have a definite answer, and it is near impossible to pinpoint exact reasons most of the time.

Except we are living in exponential times.

The gap gets smaller and smaller. Bitcoin will hopefully work that way too.

Wait until tech companies decide they want to hold onto Bitcoin for remittance, wealth security, investment potential and bragging rights.

Gold is what is needed once civilization rebuilds. The powerful will want a way to appear more powerful. You do that by having a nearly-useless precious metal turned into a necklace or other jewelry. It shows that you have so much power, you can afford your time, energy and resources into something that has no payback.
Why do corporations have fountains in their lobby? It's a huge waste of money and space! Oh, well when you walk in, the first impression you get (whether you realize it or not) is "wow, they make so much money, they can afford to drop a fountain in their lobby". This, in turn, makes you more likely to do business given their presentation of success, which makes them more money through your business.
Gold will be used to move people from the 1% to the 0.1% after a country/society rebuilds.

@_date: 2016-01-23 13:54:13
They could, but once a company controls their crytpocurrency, the main benefit of it is compromised.
I like to see it in this light: the control of the system is being open sourced. It draws similar values to the "two treasure hunters find a wealth treasure and have to split it. What is the fairest way to divide it up? The answer is to have one person make the pile and the other person chooses who gets which pile". That way no one can manipulate the system since both people technically lost complete control, yet they both control the environment. Bitcoin is just doing that on a massive scale. No one controls it, yet we all control it at the same time.
@_date: 2017-03-12 16:17:10
Even if you're under 18, you can literally set it up so NO ONE can take it from you. If only you know your private key, then only you have access to it. No law, court order, government official, or guardian can take it from you without you giving them the private key.
THAT is the power of Bitcoin. While what you may be doing is illegal, Bitcoin is technically above the law in relation to obtaining the actual Bitcoin. Sure, you can be imprisoned or punished in some way, but something like a bank can be court ordered to surrender the money/items in storage. With Bitcoin, it literally needs your permission before it can be moved. You literally own it. No one can take it. No wonder why people are afraid of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:24:24

Seems promising.
I really hope the Lightning Network is not the only solution that emerges. I want to see multiple approaches to this so users can choose which system is best for their needs. That's the only way I see true innovation emerging.
That being said, being able to offload and onload BTC on a lightning channel is a VERY useful feature worth having.
@_date: 2017-03-29 09:54:35
If many experts in the field told me I was wrong, I'd probably doubt myself and maybe do a bit more research.
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:28:03
I think that's what makes Bitcoin so amazing; the lack of authority or any central control. It literally is something created that can't easily be fucked up by an incompetent human or law that tells it what to do. Since it's global, no single country can control it either, so every country has to fight in order to produce the electricity and technology to keep up with everyone else.
It will deter war. It will be another space race, but this time it's entirely artificial. There will be races in mathematics and technology,  which hopefully can benefit the world. 
It's almost as if we've developed another law of mathematical nature. We harnessed mathematics and created a platform that is going to be obsessed over.
@_date: 2019-03-23 03:21:44

Half Japanese Bubbles?
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:17:32
There is a HUGE desire to lower the price as much as possible for many reasons:
-they want it to fail and die out
-they want price to lower and kick competing miners out of the industry
-they want to lower the price as much as possible, buy in large amounts, and resell once it bounces back up
-big time investors want to get the cheapest price possible before making a major investment
-they want to stall the system until banks and other organizations can figure out how to step in and profit from the system

I think this should be the symbol. The mystery now has a sexy answer of what the symbol represents
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:16:32
There are many, many things that influence price. You're not knowledgeable enough to pinpoint every cause, or else you'd be doing this at the 6-digit level.
Prices fluctuate. As price keeps increasing, people feel more and more pressure to cash out. If I bought Bitcoin at $0.10 each and bought 20,000 of them, I'd occasionally sell a good 1,500 Bitcoin as I feel it hits a peak. That gives me enough money for the rest of my life if I do 3 or 4 sell-offs, and I still have enough Bitcoin to be safe. Sometimes people sell off large amounts. This is one of thousands of scenarios that could make a price drop.
There are people playing a much larger game of Bitcoin trading than you are. They influence the market better than you. The best way to "win" is to invest with a long term strategy in mind. Ride the waves, as the general direction is still up.
@_date: 2017-03-17 10:10:09
I think this is a lot of price manipulation. People may be trying to sell Bitcoin in massive amounts in order to drive up other alt coins to try and say "see what happens when you don't listen to us?"
@_date: 2017-03-01 11:26:05
I agree 100%. The scenario is almost entirely fueled by emotion. However, that's a very significant factor when it comes to the price of almost anything.

I wonder if they are trying to perfect the next generation of equipment that works exceptionally well with BU. That way, any competitor that tries to make equipment will always be behind by a couple steps in terms of making quality miners to compete.
If you're always a step ahead of your competition(especially by your own doing), you will never have competition.
Does the implementation of BU have a scenario where a certain, more specialized miner, would be able to mine more efficiently? I'm no expert.

You only need one state to welcome the tech trend. It'll start as a small pocket of innovation and growth, but before you know it, a super tiny silicon valley will emerge in the field.
@_date: 2016-03-23 16:17:57
Every altcoin does the job of keeping bitcoin competitive.
At any point, if bitcoin becomes shitty through manipulation, there's a "lesser coin" that people can flock to.
Just like there are really good hotels, and there are crappy hotels surrounding it. It keeps the good hotel from charging insane rates and also prevents them from ever going below the competition.
This is not an active use, but rather a passive one, and I am grateful we have them.

Secondly, do not overly trust anyone trying to help. Be skeptical, make discussions public on this subreddit, and ask people to chime in if they agree with the advice/steps given.

* Do not blindly trust the first person offering to solve all your problems if you "just let them handle it"
* Do ask us before moving forward on any steps
* Since you are working with A LOT of money, you may want to buy a brand new cheap laptop or PC and recover coins from that device, as malware will target cryptocurrency

It also comes down to people being skeptical at first to put their BTC in a Segwit wallet. Their caution is understandable, especially if holding. Who knows we might see an even more efficient method at some point, and why burn up 2 transaction fees when you can just wait it out?

Yahoo, showing promise for a split second, then somehow making itself seem even less competent.

This concept is really cool.
However, Youtube is a free service, and that is the reason 95% of people use it. Getting 10,000 views on Youtube is much easier than getting 10,000 videos on any platform where visitors have to pay upfront for the privilege of watching videos.
It's a cool concept, maybe also allow advertisers to offer to PAY users in bitcoin to watch their advertising videos? That way you allow a two-way ecosystem? That would attract younger members, especially if there were some cool tv series being shown on there.

A 51% attack works as follows:
* I obtain 51% of hashing power
* I make a bunch of transactions and spend BTC for goods and services as usual
* I outpace the global network but do it secretly, while neglecting the transactions I've personally created (maybe even send that same money to another one of my wallets instead)
* I do this for a set amount of time until I'm at least several blocks ahead of the rest of the global network
* I "unleash" my attack by releasing my mined blockchain to nodes. Since I have more blocks with proper proof of work, nodes disregard the "lesser" chain
* My transactions never went through to others, and lots of other chaos forms as people struggle to figure out transactions that didn't actually stick

Bad systems use a static system like charging $.50 every time we use a gift card. What if I buy a $1 stick of gum? My fee was 50%.

We know the decision is happening soon. If someone were to manipulate the price by buying a ton of Bitcoin, the price will surely rise. People will think someone has insider knowledge of the decision, and the average person will think "oh well if people are buying a ton, they know the decision is positive for Bitcoin, so I'll buy a bunch too so I can earn some profits". Then, the person that drove the price up will sell at a larger profit, leaving the average person with a loss.

When I hit a 500% gain on Bitcoin (bought at $200-$250ish), I sold enough to recover my initial investment. Sure, that additional 20% might be a lot more in the future, but the remaining 80% is infinite return on investment. Let it roll!

Of course, but if I had to take a gamble, I'd put more allocation into BTC than anything else.
Altcoins may find better ways of doing things, but everyone will hyper-invest it to insane levels, then manipulate the price as it approaches a more reasonable assessment of the value.
Any newer coin will face this issue. It's kinda like how there can never really be the "next" Facebook that will take off, because you have greedy companies salivating at the opportunity to gobble up user data and wedge themselves into the investor space to control and manipulate the ecosystem from the start. The "next" Facebook needs to solve these problems to the point of where investors and casual observers look at it and say "What? That can never work. It is too radical of an idea!" and then it ends up slipping through the cracks of doubt.

We saw the prediction as possible. Some thought it was likely. Others thought we needed more time to develop the tech before that level of value would be established.
Tim may also be the only correct predictor because if confirmation bias. Did you find his prediction because he was qualified, or because he was right?
With that mentality, I'll predict $15k BTC by May of this year. If I'm right I'll raise awareness of this old post and everyone will think I was right because of intelligence. If I'm wrong this prediction fades into the sea of old comments and I face no consequence.

So I hear a lot of people asking if they should buy now.
You should be dollar cost averaging your way in.
You should be speculating if:
* you can afford to lose that money
* you have the emotional stability to shrug off a 50% loss
* you know things others don't know (not by asking people on Reddit if you should buy in, depending on Reddit for financial speculation advice is stupid; these strangers have no care if you lose your money or not)
* you have your other financial affairs in order
If you aren't able to speculate, just buy your $50, $100, $200, or whatever monthly you can afford to lose. That way you won't be devastated like so many people on here.

Way down the road, yes. I think $100k-$200k within the decade is reasonable, but still unlikely.

So imagine that we are mining gold from a mountain. You bought some gold to save because you think it will be worth money. We bring back 25 gold pieces every day. Now, a very talented geologist realizes that once we hit a certain point in the mountain, we'll only get 13 pieces of gold every day, and then in another point in the mountain, 6 pieces of gold per day, and eventually 3 pieces, and so on... From an investment standpoint, wouldn't you want to be holding onto gold as the supply starts to slow down?
Now, I used similar numbers for an example. Bitcoin can be broken down into decimals, so use the example as a very loose one.

How old are you? Do you have a traditional retirement account set up already? Do you have 5-6 months of expenses saved? Do you understand how investing works? Do you know how Bitcoin works on the elementary level? Can you stomach a 20% loss in a single day?

There are several reasons why I prefer BTC:
* It was the first. Early adopters of BTC bought it because it was cool. They got the reward for buying into something that appeared to have no use aside from playing with a new application of cryptography
* Dev team is awesome. I barely hear about them because they are working on making the magic happen. Other coins seem to parade their devs around because apparently talent, breakthroughs and quality development doesn't speak for itself.
* The creator did not make it to get rich or copycat into the field. ETH has a similar approach as it isn't really intended to be money.
* BTC isn't designed to be attached to anything but PoW and the network effect. Other coins try to be money AND to purchase a service AND build an identity AND do other stuff. If your coin is used for decentralized storage, it will always be tied to the price of storage.
* It is open source and openly welcomes people to fork it. You wanna make your own BTC fork? You can! It just might not work out the way you want.
* It is incredibly simple when you break it down to the base components. Everything else is being built ontop of it and not really ruining the base layer of functionality. SegWit was a change, sure, but BTC still works just fine.

No problem. Seed is kept safe.
@_date: 2019-11-18 20:44:40
When you spend BTC, you send the whole amount split usually among two parties; the recipient and yourself to a new address, often a tiny amount of BTC. Those add up over time.
So lots of these were all consolidated, where one transaction sends BTC from many of these small addresses all into one receiving address, consolidating all of their "pocket change addresses" all into one. This makes it easier and cheaper to send BTC when the network becomes more full and you pay higher fees to send it.
It is wise to do this when you can get away with costs as cheap as a 1 sat/byte transaction fee.
@_date: 2016-06-01 14:18:33

@_date: 2019-11-19 02:15:36
The reason this is done is because you have to send change to a new address, or else risk a cryptographic attack. Quantum computers could eventually be tweaked to combat the issue of reusing the same receiving address.
I'd welcome any solution that combats this, but I'm not going to accept any solution that weakens the security of BTC.

The dollar can still operate within the current world economy.
I like a world where instead of Bitcoin killing fiat, it operates as a "don't mess up your currency policy or else your citizens will dump it faster than you can print it" threat.

It would eventually stop a lot of growth, probably lower the value.
However, many investors will look at that and realize the only reason China is stopping access to bitcoin is because they're terrified of the power and potential.

Coinbase has an algorithm that sets the price based on their own internal supply and demand. Yeah, you could probably buy bitcoin on another exchange and sell it to coinbase, and people will do that, and yes they make a lot of money sometimes. This eventually evens out the prices. However, there is also a cost associated with buying and selling the bitcoin (transaction fee is the extra you pay to actually get the bitcoin) between different exchanges. When they do this swap between exchanges, they need to estimate the expected cost of exchanging between not 1, but 2 exchanges. If the process of doing it isn't high enough (or non-existent), no one tries to do a major swap from one exchange to another.

Nope. Once we start to have larger and larger history to refer, we can start to pinpoint trends or events that influence bitcoin price. At some point it will hit a theoretical cap, and people will understand what is is and does.

Dude, you're new to this, I assume.
When you invest, you take a risk. I think you expect us to be able to predict the future. We can't... Otherwise we would be rich.
We can't tell you if you'll get rich or not, and we can't really tell you what the price will be in the future. Might go up, might go down. The risk is yours to take.

I agree on the mathematics, but...
If OP remembers 3 or 4 more words down the road there's a significantly better chance. It's better to dump data for now, and in case there's a time in 30 years when it becomes crackable, OP may have a goldmine at that point.

Let it stay under the radar until it becomes too expensive to "lock in". All of a sudden it will explode in popularity and everyone will be insulted that they didn't know about it before you could reasonably own a single bitcoin.
Then use your knowledge of how the market will react, and play the price waves accordingly. If you're smart, experienced and level headed with bitcoin investments, you'll make a lot of money off of public ignorance. I call it a "dumb tax".
I hate to say it, but we do our homework so we deserve the early entry and cheap prices. We worked hard to grow the community and learn about this groundbreaking technology. If popular opinion isn't in favor of bitcoin before the price skyrockets, then popular opinion won't profit from bitcoin.
I know what the technology is capable of. I did my research and put in my time. I'll see you all on that tropical island in 10 years.
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:48:53

@_date: 2017-01-27 17:55:23
I feel like every attempt to build a digital currency will fail to Bitcoin. Bitcoin will have the history and developer support.
Also, every "new" crypto currency will either be pre-mined to hell, coded so certain people/organizations have control over it, or it will be lacking in quality.
@_date: 2018-10-12 18:59:26
So, gold was used to back currency, and the notes were basically a promise for gold.
Remove the gold, and you get empty promises via paper. You can change what they can buy if they don't guarantee a certain weight in gold. A dollar today buys much less than a dollar in 1980.
Once you CAN manipulate this, it's just a matter of time until someone finds way to do it. And then they cannot resist the temptation to keep doing it, and eventually make plans around the expectation of manipulation. Governments spend money, then expect to print the bills to pay for that debt.
I think you can see how this spells disaster eventually.

I see it as a correction. Bitfinex was the evidence that things grew too fast.
More of us care about getting rich quick to say "I told you so" to their friends from a yacht than they do about bitcoin actually evolving and becoming a revolutionary tool for humanity. I openly admit being one of these people, but it again becomes evident that bitcoin isn't about greed. It's about change and fairness.

It's really really difficult to predict.
I'm holding my Bitcoin, but I'm playing with "theoretical Bitcoin" as well, where I took $10,000 and bought/sold based on what I thought the price would be. I didn't do so hot.
If you think you can trade on this, do what I did and make some "pretend money" to see how you do at investing.

The current market cap for bitcoin allows for 52,000 millionaires under just that currency. Given that there are roughly 15,000,000 millionaires in the world, there is still an insane amount of potential for the price.
I know it's a weird comparison, but it is helping me understand where Bitcoin can still scale. Throw in a bunch of corporations who will want to hold Bitcoin and we could see one bitcoin easily being able to buy a house or 5.

Let banks make their own "blockchain". Customers will start to understand it, get involved, probably be forced to use it so the bank has bragging rights.
It will fail, but people will have the understanding that digital currency is useful and powerful. Once the banks fuck it all up, bitcoin (and maybe some competing altcoins) will rise like crazy.
Cheer for the banks; they're pushing to make digital currency a thing. Yet they don't stand a chance in the long run.

You also run the risk of losing.
We always celebrate the "underdog" who did what everyone else was too afraid to do, but we hardly learn about the losers of that mentality.
Diversification is a good idea. Shifting asset allocations adds risk but improves reward.
I do not recommend investing more than 20% of your savings into crypto. It's just too risky. What's funny is when the price does go up, people laugh at me for not being more allocated in crypto, but during the major drops, apparently I'm not supposed to talk about the gains I made over the last 2 years in the stock market?
@_date: 2019-11-18 15:53:02
So this is your lesson in only investing what you can afford to lose. You got greedy, it seems, and decided to prioritize that over rational judgement. In hindsight, your business could have used that money more effectively.

* You're coming here for help
It may be time to step back from this irresponsible gamble. You can sell most of it and recover the money.
* You're coming here so we can convince the gambler in you that you're making the right choice
One if the worst traits of a gambler is that they find ways to convince themselves they're right. No one knows the answer, but if you get enough people to convince you that you're right, you can suppress your doubts. This is a dangerous game, and you stand to lose everything if you are wrong. I'm not here to help you gamble. Get 90% out of this crazy gamble.
No matter what you choose to do in life, that's on you. If you're willing to lose your house on this, good luck.

No bank compliance, no forced withdrawal of money, etc. I wanted to be protected with at least some emergency money that no one else could touch.

If you have 5 Bitcoin, you have $15,000 today. We haven't even come close to mainstream adoption or financial corporations dipping their hands into the market.
I think having one Bitcoin will be a high class status symbol at some point just like having $1,000,000. When the internet exploded in popularity, the value was added to society, not taken from other sectors. The same can happen with Bitcoin, and nothing is stopping it from growing insanely huge. Comparing it to market caps probably is underestimating it by at least one order of magnitude.
I am confident we will see 1 Bitcoin being able to buy a mansion. Probably much more down the road.

Charities need help, but it can sometimes be useless to give them money and hope it works out. Volunteer for events, be a big brother or big sister, do some weird volunteering like cleaning parks, etc. Also invest time and energy into local politics and community projects. Maybe even join local politics to help society grow the way you envision?
Diversify your money. Take a small percentage out as an emergency fund. You never know when a major emergency will hit. Be prepared.
Invest in your health. Learn to cook healthy, become physically fit, learn proper techniques for making your life healthy and happy.

Let me explain one very important thing about cryptocurrency:
In the crypto world, your coins aren't at some arbitrary risk percentage. It is 100% or 0%. Even if you trust a company 99%, you still run the risk of that 1% taking everything, with "no backsies". Get the majority of your money out of exchanges. I'm not taking a 1% risk at truly getting fucked over. Neither should you. I do keep about 10% in there because if I'm in a pinch for money I can always sell it, or I can also spend it where bitcoin is accepted. I accept that this money has a risk of being stolen. My other 90% is being secured.
The rest is stored on MY devices. Either a phone with a trusted wallet, PC wallet, a hardware device, or whatever else is used to actually secure bitcoin.
Don't trust exchanges. Learn to secure bitcoin. Secure your bitcoin and make it truly "yours".

Every 10 min or so, 25 bitcoins get added to the market. In a month. We'll only be getting 12.5 bitcoins every 10 min. In another 4ish years, 6.25. it will keep cutting in half as time goes on. This was coded into the system to make bitcoin a depreciating asset, which in theory should steadily raise the value of it.
@_date: 2016-06-20 01:15:19
A system where you don't really experience the client/server role. Instead of there being a corruptible organization or one that can't make perfectly fair decisions for their users, you can instead decide to use a system that is perfectly transparent that no one can shape or change to fit their agenda.
It's kind of like the laws of a country vs the laws of nature. A country can create/change/remove/ignore a law. Nature, however, doesn't allow for such an action to occur. You have no reason to distrust nature in any way because it will act the exact same way every time.

Segwit needs to be used, and the lightning network will hopefully solve these issues. By using lightning, multiple transactions can be bundled together in a way, and that $3 transaction fee could be split among multiple participants when you "close out" the channel.

I have friends asking me "where can I buy Bitcoin for under $500 each?"
Ohhh, you clever little genius! Yeah, there are places to buy it for half off so you can either sell it for twice the price or lock in certain earnings. Of course no one would ever think of that!
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:29:56
@_date: 2017-08-10 04:08:54
Lightning network is optional. You can still send Bitcoin.
And the fee is too low? Then mining power will drop and so will difficulty. Sure, it means less of a hashrate security wall, but once the price goes up we will see increases in mining.
Also, lightning is probably going to increase the number of transactions, as some people will open lightning networks and close them immediately once they settle the debt.
Lightning is opening more doors, and therefore more opportunities for more users.

Very few Americans are actually investing in it. Most say they want to or should be doing so.
But most people are basically sitting around saying they want to invest but can't stand the thought of losing 5% overnight. The volatility is a risky factor that scares people. They want someone to come up and personally guarantee it so they see no risk. By the time that happens, most of the growth will be made and it'll be too late. $5k, $10k, $25k, and even $100k will all be points where people will say "I should have invested when it was $x" every single time. And they'll be afraid of getting in until they are at least 4 or 5 major waves of price growth"

Well done, but you'll literally get this response:
"Yeah but my Alienware computer is like, so much stronger than everyone else's computer, so I'll probably make a lot more money than the average computer user"
And then they never start mining.
Honestly, the best learning experience is to set up your computer for mining and learning that it'll take you 1000 years to make a few dollars.
That's what I did. I realized I was making like 35 cents per day(years ago with rockminers) and would probably never recover my investment, even at free electricity. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:05:08
Very true.
Once Bitcoin hits $2000 I'm selling 10% of my holdings to get all of my initial investment back. That way, there is zero consequence in my eyes. It's also going straight into my IRA, so it's a smart investment either way.
Bitcoin might make people rich, but it might also be sold just to out a person into a more viable living situation. Rent often keeps you trapped in a "too poor to save for a house" kind of scenario.

I bought one at $675. Hoping that investment pays off!
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:14:51
The way I see it:
If a debt can be paid as "I'll get you next time", such as drinks in a bar, grabbing coffee, or even something like dinner, then it probably doesn't need to be put on the blockchain. If simple social acts can remove the need (and difficulty) for a transaction to be preserved forever, then it doesn't need to be done on chain.
If I buy you a drink, you will probably buy me one later that night. Just through our social preference, we have removed the value of dumping both transactions on the blockchain individually.
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:25:19

I imagine the majority of this infrastructure will still exist if Bitcoin became the dominant currency.
We would have people visiting banks, writing software, storing keys for citizens(people are not smart enough to do this on their own. Let's be brutally honest). Banks will change, and we will still need them.
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:29:03
Well, you have to factor in a few things.
Asic chips do not follow Moore's Law of technology doubling every 2 years. They've had 7 years do to 25 years of development. Once we hit the minimal nanometer length for transistors, we will steadily grow. Once that happens, toss an asic into a water heater for coffee or showers, heating in areas that need it 24/7, etc.
I think they will counterbalance mining. Right now warehouses in China can mine for free because of excess electricity. That will change soon. We will have decentralized mining.
This isn't my idea, Andreas Antonopolous spoke about this. I'm reiterating his observations because I agree with them.

Elliptic curve is 2 prime numbers multiplied to find a private key. Quantum is really good at finding those two numbers; as it "tests" all of the numbers at the same time and collapses the two winning numbers.
Hash functions are a completely different type of mathematical function. It gives you a signature of what you put into the function. Quantum cannot break this as you can't "test all the numbers". There isn't such a simple way to brute force hash functions. Also, many many inputs can point to the same hash function output.

Let me put it in perspective:
If you own one Bitcoin, that means there can only be 20,999,998 other people in the world who have more Bitcoin than you. Given that there are many people who own thousands of bitcoins, that means there will be significantly less people who can ever have more money than you.
I don't know exactly how wealthy, but if Bitcoin ownership becomes a big thing for tech, where companies like Apple, Google, and others want to hold onto Bitcoin as bragging rights (we own 12% of all Bitcoin, look how cool we are), then Bitcoin won't follow pricing rates associated with a gold market cap or anything, it will be its own economic ecosystem, and it will be HUGE.

A Roth IRA is an account where you can deposit $5500 per year in the account. At 59.5 years old, you can start to withdraw money from that account TAX FREE (as long as the money has been sitting there for 5 years or more). This means if you bought 1000 of GBTC at $100 per share and sold it at a much higher number, like let's say $1000, you earned $900,000 profit from that stock. Since it is in your Roth IRA, that money can be withdrawn TAX FREE.
The appeal is having this in such an account. Even if you're paying a 50% premium, it's a drop in the bucket if it goes up 3000% and you can avoid ~25% taxes.

He subscribes to those wall street bet newsletters and takes them as absolute truth.

One proposed solution is to add a Layer 2. Layer 2, the lightning network, will be able to combine tons of transactions into one transaction.
If we have a large pool of people trying to combine transactions, we can spread a single transaction fee across tens of thousands of transactions. Even if a fee is $1,000, we can have 10,000 transactions combined into a lightning network to make the cost per transaction $0.10.
What if we did 100,000 transactions? 1,000,000 transactions? The fees drop considerably.
We're far from perfecting this, but big moves are being made all the time.

Yeah but when people hear how Bitcoin is a scam or garbage several times, but shortly after each time the price rises, beginners gain a sense of skepticism after each misleading fact. Then they learn that they can inspect the code themselves and start to actually learn how things work with independently researching for information.
That's how you get people hooked on Bitcoin. Let them realize that they shouldn't trust the word of anyone before fact checking and gaining your own understanding. That's how we'll attract people to the system.
I say better now than later.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:12:05
Basically no way for anyone to screw you over, legally or illegally, ethically or unethically.
We could build a "bitcoin paying network" via coinbase where you keep your money in custodial accounts and coinbase handles transfer of money when needed, but it's only a matter of time before someone calls a friend at coinbase and gets a transaction refunded for some bullshit reason.
This wasn't trustless. You run the risk of your money being taken back, sometimes for stupid reasons that aren't your fault.
With pure Bitcoin transactions, you don't face that issue. If I send you the money, you get it. No takebacksies. The drawback is that transaction fees can be expensive for thousands of small transactions being made.
So the people building the lightning network figured out a way to build a large "pending transaction" (let's say 4 BTC) that allows people to make a transaction but delay the payment by 30 days or however long desired. During this time period, the customer can "release" parts of the funds by only signing part of that transaction at a time. I can "release" 0.5 Bitcoin at first, then another 1.3 Bitcoin, then maybe another 1.1 Bitcoin. Also, let's say the 1.3 Bitcoin transaction was for something I didn't like, so I get 1.2 of it refunded to account for shipping back to them. So we have +0.5, +1.3, +1.1, and -1.2. At the end of the time period, these signatures figure out the final debt and we are left with 1.7 Bitcoin going to the merchant and the remaining 2.3 going back to the customer. At the time of this transaction taking place, we did 4 transactions for the price of one.
But that's just the basics behind it. What if we wanted to add a third member? Done. Hell, let's add another 5,000 people to the network. As long as the debts within the system stay within the locked amount of Bitcoin, this will work just fine. This can theoretically scale infinitely.
Splitting transactions into thousands of transactions "off chain" will make transaction fees super cheap. Nodes that run lightning can collect tiny transactions just to cover costs of electricity maintenance and a small profit incentive for doing this.

Mining right now is going to be extremely inefficient. Most miners have state of the art equipment (thousands of dollars for one of these rigs and probably hundreds of rigs). They also have near free electricity. Right now you'd probably never be able to return the costs of your equipment by mining, so keep that in mind as well.

Then, Goku will go beyond SSJ2 into SSJ3 when no one expects it. It will be unimaginably crazier than anything we ever expected. Bitcoin makes anyone rich who is holding 1 or more Bitcoin.

Compare this to safe withdrawal amount. Often, a properly invested amount of money can be withdrawn at 4% indefinitely as earnings from investments hit on average 7%. This accounts for bad financial years and inflation. $1m gives you $40,000 per year to withdraw indefinitely.
With Bitcoin, you're basically going to want to withdraw at the rate in which it goes up in value to keep you sustained. While it is new technology and a new financial system, you could probably be okay with spending 2-3% per year of your Bitcoin and it will increase in value to compete with it, but you also will hate how the first few years of btc spent turned into such a huge amount of money.

That's what actually makes these coins valuable in my opinion. If Bitcoin is first to innovate, they have one chance to get it up and running.
Now let's say Litecoin wants to follow suit on a new feature. They get to see Bitcoin work and learn from any mistakes or hindsight errors. They can anticipate this error and launch a feature with less risk for issues.
This also works the other way around, too. Litecoin got segwit first. Bitcoin followed after.

I think if you imagine a highway (let's call it H23) being split into 2 roads, you would have H23 and H23A. The new road would take the name H23A because the old one stayed on a more direct route to the destination, according to the people who use that highway the most.
It feels like Bitcoin cash is doing a different route, especially because a minority appears to have split in this direction. Price is a partial indicator of this mentality.

I suppose you could set up a system where a company could embed a link to an ad in transaction data, and the ad "releases" the mining fee to the miner once it is launched. The miner just doesn't confirm the fee until the recipient accesses the ad.
Possible, but sounds complicated. Maybe a company like Google would do something of that nature. They are an advertisement company, after all.

There are difficulties that will arise as barriers keep getting put up. I think that just the idea of governments and organizations trying to control or regulate bitcoin means that they're seeing potential in it.
Once it starts showing potential when a few talented workers develop something amazing for a major company, it'll resonate among other businesses. It's just like how companies will grasp use of computers for the first time in an office. Then they built networks and got connected online. Now internet usage dominates how almost every business operates. It's the next phase in this chain of getting paid in cash for work &gt; getting paid by check &gt; getting paid as direct deposit &gt; getting paid by automated systems that don't have bank fees.

Because you can transfer it to a few wallets and tumble the coins. From there you can spend it as you please and not pay taxes on your gains.
You buy a thousand Bitcoins for $200 each. You send it to another wallet and tumble them at $700. Then you spend it on a house that's $700,000.
You gained buying power during that time period and you need to report the income. Where do you expect to pay taxes on your capital gains?

Being appropriate doesn't really matter. If Bitcoin doesn't work, it has a long line of other cryptos that will take it's place. I'm a decentralized system, there cannot be someone who decides what should happen and when. This is a system where we need to come together to make it work. If people don't agree, the system must be renegotiated. We've seen that miners had the power, but then they didn't once node runners decided to flex their muscles. But then at the same time investors can abandoned ship if it doesn't fit their needs. Ontop of that we need the developers to agree to the needs.
In every situation, we must cooperate selflessly. Improvements must benefit everyone to be accepted into the system. In a centralized system, we get one person making HUGE decisions that always leaves people feeling like they got the short end of the stick. In Bitcoin, every compromise is a guaranteed partial benefit for you.

Fees used to be free. Then they had to decide on either:
* Trust someone to determine what makes a transaction valid
* Introduce a free market with transaction fees (the winner)
The two proposed solutions are:
* Condense transactions into a summarizing statement between multiple participants (lightning ontop of segwit)
* Increase block size
My complaint about block size increases is that if a free market decides a transaction is worth $8, a double block size increase cuts price to $4, as lightning could turn one $8 transaction into 100,000 transactions each paying their proportional fraction of $8.

Some people don't really care about "getting it", they just want to make sure they "get in on the Bitcoin thing". They don't want to learn anything about it, they just want to have some.
And I tell them every time that if Bitcoin went to $1,000,000 their exchange might just pack it up and disappear. They can't fathom how that could happen, threaten to sue, and will "make sure I get what's mine". I ask how they plan to launch a legal battle against a now-billionaire company that may have just packed it up and moved to another country and can put an unfathomable legal barrier up against them.
They're willing to launch a multi-year lawsuit against a company, but can't be bothered to spend 30 minutes preventing an exchange from holding their Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is significantly less complicated in my opinion, but your point is spot on. Let applications hide it. However, once a user "gets" Bitcoin, trying to explain "locked" coins in limbo scares them, because they finally got over the hurdle of "not your private keys, not your Bitcoin", we're now asking them to lose their access to Bitcoin to put it in a "transaction limbo" where the transaction can be altered. It's a scary new concept for people to understand UNTIL they realize any tomfoolery punishes that user.


They are both complicated, I agree.

Not sure if that's how it works.
If you had a business or had other investments, you might be able to have that loss factored into your taxes, much like how investments in stocks follow this pattern. If I sell one stock at a gain and another at a loss,  both are factored in together when taxes are due.
Listen, if you churn a profit in the US, you pay taxes on the profits. I know people don't like that, but that's the law. If you don't like it, I don't know what to tell you.

Well,  they want to invest, but they don't want to do any extra work. Verifying identity and all that stuff is a "I'll do it tomorrow" kind of response I get.
My girlfriend said she'd "do it tomorrow". I sat her down and told her the only time I would help her is right now, and she did it. She invested $200 over a month or so and now that amount is worth $280.
Tell people they need about an hour to set it all up, and then another 2 hours to learn how to store it. Remind them that "tomorrow tasks" never get done and they've already missed out on a lot of tomorrows. How many more do they want to miss?

Damn right they move fast. And yeah, have a plan going in to the field and STICK TO IT. Only adjust plans if you are in a level headed state of mind, and any adjustments to your plan have a logical way to approach risk/reward rebalancing in a safe and healthy way.


Yup. If your investment makes you worried, you need to rebalance IMMEDIATELY. You've already put yourself in a vulnerable situation. You need to emphasize safety.


Day trading is like trying to "go pro" in a sport after doing a month of "pick up" games at a local park.


I read a new white paper 3-4 times a week. I basically grab the biggest (in terms of market cap) coin's white paper that I haven't read yet. I'm about 300 white papers in, and this has helped so much!


Yup. A level headed person almost always takes an emotional investor's money.


Yup. That allocation needs to reflect your understanding and the risk involved. Anything over 10% of your total investments without robust knowledge of crypto is asking for a problem. Don't even think about investing in crypto without a maxed out Roth IRA.


Every single person who has done DCA for over a year or more does not regret doing DCA.

Think of transportation. We don't use automobiles for all transport needs. We have cars that carry most people, trucks for bulky good, trains for other resources and airplanes for overseas travels. You COULD do all transportation via airplane but it would be grossly inefficient. Different coins for different decentralized things, just like different types of transportation fulfill different needs.

With the Amazon prime card, you get 5% cash back. However, that card is offered through Amazon and they extend a discount since a credit card company isn't applying a merchant fee.
So this means that through bitcoin and purse.io, we are competing with the discount Amazon is willing to offer by doing the sale/transaction "in house". That's pretty sweet.
If purse.io ends up finding a way to offer a better discount, that truly shows off the power of bitcoin.

As the price drops, people get irrational due to emotions. It's like FOMO but the fear is of missing out on that value.
You buy a Bitcoin at $8000. It drops to $7500. You are "losing" and it drives you crazy. It drops to $7200 and you can't stand the idea of it going below $7000, so you sell.
Bitcoin is also a lot of people's first serious investment, and they don't know what they're doing at all.

You could also communicate the location of the buried box via an encrypted channel across the internet thus "spending" it. It would be a weird system but it would still work. Carrying isn't relevant in this conversation.
To educate them, I would explain how it works on the technical level, how to explore the blockchain to follow transaction history, the reason why people are using it, a general computer science overview of the sha256 algo and how it connects blocks to each other, and quite a bit more actually.

The second you start looking at it in terms of monetary value, the more people will demand it fit the needs of what the price can become.

@_date: 2018-06-05 15:11:51
While I agree to some degree, legal tender means the government is willing to enforce laws to force the currency to be accepted. No government will do that due to the volatility and lack of control of the currency.
Instead, governments should let it exist, and if the free market decides it wants to use cryptocurrency, let it be. The government will enforce laws surrounding the use within the country as opposed to forcing citizens to accept it as legal tender.
You probably don't want a government to legally mandate it as legal tender.

With RBF, I can low-ball a 1-2 sat/byte fee and be absolutely fine knowing it could be bumped up in 30 minutes if nothing sticks.
In fact, that should be the default approach for people not in a rush. Why not low-ball it and see if anyone is willing to snap up an extra tiny transaction fee in the block? I'll keep nudging it up until someone takes it, so I find the cheapest option.
Also, I wholeheartedly recommend people use lightning, or at the very least try it. I was so skeptical at first, but now a layer 1 transaction feels so clunky and outdated.

Just tell them you sold it at a decent profit and stop talking about it.
Then, if the price does skyrocket and they tease you about selling, you can whip out the "I lied to shut you up. I knew what I was investing in." Or make them feel really really guilty for convincing you to sell, and now it's at a new ATH.
Just make sure you actually invest responsibly.

You raise some good points. Consider Bitcoin like owning property in a booming town. If too many people hold property without building on it, the economy may fail due to less "use" of the area.
However, I see it as owning property in an area where you know there is going to be something HUGE like an amusement park being built a mile down the road. I may be choking out the small town economy, but I'm going to profit from the bigger picture. It's just a matter of time. Most of us are waiting for the amusement park to be built. We've been to the town meetings and heard the proposals from the entrepreneurs of the amusement park, and we know nothing is going to stop the process.

Good time to emphasize that you should only be investing in volatile stuff like BTC if you can afford to HODL for long term.
If BTC crashes, and you also have bills, you might have to sell at a loss. That's worse than not investing at all!

Good for them. Only a matter of time before they have issues with efficiency and other exchanges start getting competitive.
I think right now, the high fees are somewhat attached to the "trust" factor that Binance hasn't done anything insane to kill trust. "Time up and running" is a key factor, as I doubt anyone here would dump $10,000 into a no-name exchange that promised to behave.

It might fall. It might rise.
One valid strategy, supported by most, is "dollar cost averaging", where you buy at regular intervals to try and capture a steady price over time.
You might get some lows, some highs, but they should average out over time and give you steady exposure.
Do this over the course of a year and you'll be less emotionally involved about "sniping" the best possible price.

@_date: 2019-08-14 12:13:53
So yes, computers solve problems. The problem is made to adjust in difficulty to average out a win-rate of every 10 minutes. Keep this in mind.
Miners take all the transactions and bundle them into a block, chained to the previous one through a hash output (this basically can take any amount of data and output a "calculation" of fixed length. The word "hello" and the declaration of Independence both have the same hash output length). When miners bundle a block of transactions, they start grabbing hash outputs of the block by changing tiny things in it to change the hash output in the hopes of the first X digits being consecutive zeroes. They keep doing this until they "win" or they head another miner "won", and then move onto the next block.
So the process of mining has a great utility in this system. It forces participants to burn huge amounts of computing power in order to secure the next set of transactions. And if they do anything wrong, like give themselves more btc or change any aspect of the protocol, they just wasted the energy by not playing by the rules. Also, if anyone wanted to "rewrite" the history of the network they would need to replicate that expensive process of mining. They wouldn't have a high chance of success in doing so because it would be more profitable to simply join the network and earn money rather than attack it and potentially fail. This is the concept of proof of work; where you prove to the network
So yeah, mining is neat. Very interesting approach to blockchain tech. Some coins do it without this excessive application, but I haven't found anything remarkable. I do have other stuff on my radar but that's a post for another subreddit.

Kinda. I see Bitcoin like gold. You can't make more, and it gets harder and harder to mine. Bitcoin does inflate slowly. 
if the value of my Bitcoin gives me enough wealth to buy a really really nice car without even worrying about how what percentage of Bitcoin I'm spending, I will still spend. it may be nice to hoard all of your money, but I'm no Scrooge. I want to help people out financially, I want to buy nice things for myself, and I also want to adjust my position in crypto to better reflect a fair split between more traditional markets such as index funds, and crypto


have you ever made a Bitcoin transaction? You probably paid a transaction fee, which is an additional incentive for minors. Once the reward goes to zero, transaction fees will be the incentive for minors. Since we are going on a very steady Pace at cutting the reward every four years minors can prepare for this adjustment in income, and the market can naturally adjust.


because every time someone goofs up, the value and scarcity of my Bitcoin goes up. it's kind of like when pirates would bury their gold on a desert island, and then die.


I have a problem with that as well, you get a lot of people who either discover Bitcoin for the first time, want to be delusional and convince themselves that they have stepped into the investment of a lifetime, and other people who also think that if they can just manipulate the price by 0.00001 percent, it will trigger another Bull run. Most communities about Bitcoin are toxic like this. Focus on the good posts and be sure to contribute and call people out on bullshit.


yes, you should be asking these questions. Bitcoin is based on the idea of Open source design, so you should be able to ask any question that you like. I initially think you should have googled some of these questions and topics to teach yourself, but many of us are happy to help. And yes I agree that time will eventually solve most of these problems

Yes there is a possibility, but there are some scenarios that are worth considering:
* Breaking Bitcoin encryption isn't going to do as much as using this method to break other encryption like nuclear launch codes. When Britain cracked the Enigma machine the Germans were using they decided to let a ship sink to protect that secret. If you find a security flaw, you hold onto it until it truly matters.
* If a flaw were discovered, I imagine there would be a fork - a change in the code - to prevent such an attack. I assume things would be "rolled back" to before the first evidence of the attack happened. This is one perk to hodling for long term.
* As these discoveries are made, it would first start with the discovery being incredibly expensive, complicated, and time consuming to pull off. That would give enough time for the ecosystem to fix itself before it became profitable to pull off.
* Bitcoin uses proof of work (burning energy to solve a complex problem) to prove the block is worthy of being added to the blockchain. That might be a hurdle that helps protect some attacks.
* Bitcoin is open source, and some of the best programmers ever are looking at the code, trying to expose security faults. They will hopefully find issues before someone else does, and move forward with it.
* Bitcoin code is extremely simple, which is a great thing because it doesn't have too many moving parts. I'd rather inspect a go-kart engine for flaws instead of a Lamborghini engine.

Good question.
You probably shouldn't be 100% into a single coin. Bitcoin is great, but you probably want to diversify into some other coins as well to be safe. We don't know the future.
Find an allocation that represents your risk tolerance and understanding of cryptos. I know Bitcoin inside and out, so I allocate my position accordingly. I'm about 80% in BTC, 10% ETH, 5% LTC and the rest in various altcoins. I'm also not holding a fortune. I put in less than $20 per month on average over the last 2 years, so I'm not crypto-wealthy, or even crypto-middleclass. I'm crypto-poor!
But I do understand how to allocate positions related to risk. I also invest in more traditional accounts because I see them as a more safe approach (hopefully lol).
You can buy a fraction of Bitcoin. In fact, each Bitcoin can be broken down into 100,000,000 units, so you can allocate nearly any fraction of holdings. Not sure if you're aware of that, but sometimes that fact isn't clearly made evident

Depending on local laws and how much you trust exchanges, tumbling is one of several ways to add some anonymity to your Bitcoin.
From what I gather, a few hops of money kinda kills the ability to trace it to meaningful sources. This also involves the process of not sending 100% of funds to several wallets or anything like that. It becomes obvious the coins have most likely not changed hands at that point.

It's not even about working together. Separate coins do separate things now. The market will decide.
No amount of stomping feet, yelling about why your side is better, reporting miniscule news as "the death of BTC/BCH", or anything else like that will swing the odds in either side's favor. It's two echo chambers trying to prove to the other echo chamber that their echoes are better and louder.

It depends. There are some factors to consider:
* First, settlements often happen before a case is decided. It just solves a lot of issues before things get complicated and tedious.
* Second, did someone steal his identity, or was it negligence on the phone company's side? If someone breaks into a storage unit and steals items, that's a crime. If the storage unit company opens it up for someone who just makes a verbal claim, that's different.
* Settlement may happen in his favor because of the potential bad publicity.
* It will be made aware that storage in a custodial service is NOT safe. A similar blame will be made towards the custodial service for using such a weak 2FA implementation.
It gets complicated. But most likely, a settlement will happen where the person that lost their BTC may get something from it. Or ATT may put their foot down to send a message that they will NOT be responsible for text message services as a 2FA system.

Thing is, this would be like a government trying to tame how gold can be used (jewelry, electronics, dentistry, etc).
If the government tries to tame Bitcoin, the best thing they can do is analyze where coins move. And by then we'll have better security features implemented, or move to a "scarier" privacy crypto like monero or zcash.

Okay, I'm willing to bet you speak more about Bitcoin than you think. I'm sure you've talked about it a lot at work, and it clouds your personality. Happened to me. Tried getting people in at $2.5k before the $20k bull run. Talked about it a few more times, but they wouldn't have it.
So I shut up. Never spoke to them about it again.
Never speak about it at work again, or you're going to be solely recognized as the Bitcoin guy. When price tanks people will mock you. When price rises they will expect you to give them advice to buy in just as it breaks a new all time high.
You know what you do if someone asks you about Bitcoin? You tell them you'll teach them the non-financial basics over a couple beers on them. And then you don't talk about it at work.
And drop that whole "I'll laugh in the end" mentality. That reeks of immaturity and is definitely contributing to why your coworkers see you like they do.

This. Market cap is not an indicator that "this much money went into Bitcoin"

Each BTC can be broken down into 100,000,000 units. That's more than enough for transactions.


Scarcity is a property of money. If money isn't rare, it can't help facilitate purchases. Look at Venezuela. Governments have proven that they cannot be trusted to manage the money of a country. They overprint it to cover all their needs.
Bitcoin follows a property of gold. It is scarce, and we keep finding less and less of it.
There is "inflation", but the amount created diminishes over time to establish scarcity. Now people can save money in BTC and expect it to go up in value, given that the world accepts BTC as a global currency.
@_date: 2019-08-15 14:37:59
It's interesting. Like, very interesting. The tech solves a neat computation problem, it puts money into a new paradigm, and opens up money as open source.

Encarta was centralized and subject to opinions/values of a CEO, a profit model(making a page about Beyblades isn't profitable so we won't dedicate our employees' time into it), and doesn't give users a sense of community.
There are probably better platforms than Wikipedia, but Wikipedia attracted people when it was a weird concept and not built for anything other than "let's put it into motion and see what happens"
Put those comparisons into motion for Bitcoin. Currently, I don't trust anyone who wants to "make the next Bitcoin" because it will probably be:

* Subject to an authority organization
* Pre-mined to hell and back

Basically, you have to set a transaction as pending. If you set a lower fee, you locked in that transfer balance (kinda sorta).
So if I keep a pending transaction with you for $0.01 when fees were dirt cheap, and now the fees are something wild like $3.50, I have a discounted transaction fee, so I could "sell" the liquidity for $3.25 and make a profit all while someone else happily routes through my channel for $0.25 cheaper. Rinse and repeat for people willing to do it for half, or even 1 cent below the standard transaction cost, and we have a free market emerge that slowly averages down the transaction fees over time as it becomes easier and easier to just do it all over lightning.

I think one potential argument is that inflation and other monetary policies tend to hurt the poor the most.

It seems like a cool service, but you should not be posting here. When a company decides to blatantly post stuff in communities where they do not belong, it reeks of desperation and possibly bad intentions for users.
Shotgun approach of sharing your service won't attract users appropriately. If you want good users, build a community,  post in subreddits where appropriate, and actually connect with your users.
I will not be using your service because it did not follow these logical principals. I will also advocate that others avoid your service as well. This is the price you pay for taking this approach.

So, assuming BTC ends up being a worldwide store of wealth, let's do some interesting math...
ASSUMING 21,000,000 BTC:
* Number of BTC per person in the world: 7.5Billion/21Million = 0.0028 BTC per person given a steady distribution.
* 1/0.0028 makes you 357 times more wealthy in terms of BTC
* Number of BTC per person in the US: 327Million/21Million BTC = 0.064 BTC per person given a steady distribution.
* 1/0.064 makes you 15.625 times more wealthy in terms of BTC
* 30Million millionaires in the world, meaning not all the millionaires in the world could own a single BTC if they wanted
So that's how I see things right now. Will Bitcoin become the world reserve currency? We have no idea. But this should be helpful information for analyzing your risk/reward in terms of pure mathematical speculation.
Additionally, you could very easily adjust the numbers for current distributions, assuming:
* 1-2 million coins have been lost (probably)
* Satoshi's coins may never be accessible/used
* Some millionaires have already accumulated hundreds or even thousands of BTC
* Many people have more than 1 BTC
* Many people have more BTC than their evenly distributed amount
* Companies have most likely gone after some BTC for whatever reason
We're in a weird time where, considering the potential rewards, it would be foolish to not take a small stake in this ecosystem. I'm not advocating dropping $8000 on BTC right now, but dollar cost averaging your way into owning some BTC doesn't seem like a bad idea.

It's really quite easy. I show you charts. I draw vertical lines in MS Paint so they look like they're going upwards. Your brain continues the pattern and agrees because it's a happy thought. If enough people upvote it, people will buy more BTC. That raises the price and I claim that I am correct.
This is a flawless strategy.

Let's play out that situation of an exchange getting hacked:
* Lawyers get involved and drag this out for a VERRRRRY long time. BTC may go from $8k to $50K or could go down to $2K (bear with me for this example). Let's assume you have 1 BTC for ease of discussion.
* Lawyers take their cut of expenses to figure this out
* You fill out tons of paperwork, and wait... and wait... and wait...
* "We have decided it will be best to deduct all legal fees from our site and give clients their money back. If BTC is $50K you will only get back $8K-$1K = $7K. If BTC is $2K you will get 1BTC - $1K = 0.5BTC. They will always choose the payout that benefits them.

I think it will be like the internet.
America (or any other country) might have some early impacts on things but overall it will be more focused on improvements in efficiency on the protocol rather than fulfilling the desires of one country. The second it stops being a "free" currency is the day another cryptocurrency takes the stage.
One of the key things Bitcoin is doing is banking the unbanked. The other thing (closely related) is removing the control of currency by governments, whether they be oppressive or just mildly irresponsible with their currency. Every time something irresponsible is done by governments involving money, Bitcoin gets more and more appealing to people. Eventually each government might shoot itself in the foot. The responsible ones will serve the people who hold the capability to remove the government of their fiat controls.

I think the biggest issue I had was you assuming the traditional markets won't react. When internet hit, companies solved problems by moving stock investing from brokers to self-managed accounts with sites like E-Trade. I can almost guarantee the stock market will eventually move to utilizing crypto for trading, or even better, direct translations from one stock to another.
Throw in some ways to make the markets decentralized so no one has priority or special rights, and we have a fantastic situation.
Consider how we can leave a fee to get our transaction prioritised... maybe we can do the same with stock exchanges? That way if you want to make millions of trades every second, you pay high fees, but if you want slower transactions where you're just slowly DCA'ing into an index fund, you spend low fees.
We remove the privileged traders on wall street and make them pay a higher fee for prioritized transactions. Make buying and selling decentralized and we remove the "Ponzi scheme" aspect of the stock market.
And I see this rhyming with how internet publishing slowly overcame printed press. Different, but still has the root fundamentals of news.

Bitcoin will never exceed more than 21,000,000 in quantity. No one can change that.
If an online video game company comes along and created 100 "Sword of Truth"s, noting they would never make more, they easily could break their own rule at the risk of pissing off 100 users. But if the company wants to expand and reach more members they could make 1,000 more of them. 
Bitcoin exceeding 21mm coins would break the protocol, and it wouldn't be Bitcoin anymore.
If you own a single Bitcoin, there are only 20,999,998 people who could ever have more Bitcoin than you. And what happens when no one wants to sell their Bitcoin for less than $100,000 each? Well, if someone wants one they have to pay that price.

One administrator coaches the team towards goals and features, while many others manage different aspects of the code such as display, back end actions, communication (networking), security, etc. They all have to know what the other is working on, and HOW they are coding it.

I wanted to share some thoughts on the ramifications of a fork being made to support a "big player"
Even if a fork is done, the value gets split among the two coins. Let's use A as the original chain and B as the new chain.
Important Person (IP from now forward) wants a split. IP still suffers an economic hit no matter what the situation. As a holder of x coins on chain A, I will now have xA coins and xB coins, but IP only gets xB coins. IP is still punished by losing a percentage of value related to the split percentage. In a 50/50 split, IP gets a 50% punishment. In a 95/5 split of A/B respectively, IP receives a 95% punishment. In a 20/80 split, IP receives a 20% punishment. Either way, IP still loses out in some way. One could argue that if a fork is initiated to fix this, the punishment will be related to how the users of A and B coin react to the market. In the A chain, the coins are more scarce, and participants should encourage the adoption of that chain.
This feels fair in my opinion, until you start getting big players gaming the system for their own benefit. Imagine if a company decided to "pretend to lose" some major coins, fork a crypto, manipulate prices so they can profit, then reveal that they had the crypto all along. This is one of many ways a company could game this system to profit immensely.
The second problem I see with supporting forks because IP is an important person and should be given a second chance is that you break the network effect every time you fork. A network's value is equal to the square of it's userbase, so when you split your userbase even as a 90/10 split, you still do considerably large damage to the network value, as you split the users up. If Facebook ended up splitting into a dual social network and you had to switch between "channels" to interact with friends, you would lose the sense of unity, especially if more forks happened. Imagine browsing Facebook, Facebook friends, Facebook coworkers, Facebook family, Facebook strangers, etc. It would initiate friction into the social process.
My personal opinion is that we shouldn't give "second chances" because now every major player now has a 'get out of jail free' card if they gain enough of a following. Obviously in a decentralized system we cannot appoint authority figures to determine what is a good or bad fork, but I personally believe in a 100% punishment to the person that loses their coins, no matter how it was done. The $300m someone loses may just as valuable to the $50 a person in poverty is holding, but we don't fork for everyone. This is slowly drifting away from what I call a peer-to-peer network when some users have more power than others.
I welcome any opinions, this is some thought process after a heated discussion last night with my crypto chat friends,
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:46:54

I've been on this roller coaster since 2012. Been through euphoric ups, catastrophic downs.
When I made my investment(nothing remarkable, I was poor when BTC was dirt cheap by today's standards) I made a plan and stuck to it. HODL. My plan was to ride it to the moon, or go down with the ship. (And this is okay for me, read my last paragraph).
I'm not timing the market. Sometimes weeks go by when I don't check the price.
I have a recurring $100/month buy order that's been going since 2014. Been ignoring those gains, losses, ups, downs, etc.
If you actually believe in the tech, and aren't in it to immediately sell back into USD, you won't care about current prices. If you are in it for that, you're missing the trees for the forest, or whatever that phrase is. And you deserve the stress that's happening in your life from this, because you still care about the money instead of the tech and societal implications of decentralized money.
Chill out my dudes. Tend to your traditional finances before taking the risk with Bitcoin. Be at peace with volatility, knowing you have your more reasonable investments in order. Otherwise you may be forced to sell at a loss, and I personally thank many of you for messing that up, as it gives me cheaper coins along my dollar cost averaging strategy.

Well, you won't fuck up the layer 1 system, that's simply impossible as long as the code keeps good simple security in place.
There are lightning wallets you can try right now, but you also need to convince people to use them across the network. In order to do that, you need to develop and demonstrate.
We have segwit running, now we still need lightning wallets and channels to be developed, ontop of giving people the option of setting up their lightning node.
This is a trustless environment, it will happen slowly.
If BCH had the right idea, they'd also be utilizing their big blocks fully right now and have no issues, which I believe is the case.

I use BTC to tip people for tech help.
Edit: no one else gets tips for sending me stuff I already know. Not offering any more tips to y'all thirsty dudes.

Sure. But in general that's the advice I give people.


It may seem like a "when, not if" situation but we still don't know that. If the potential payoffs are huge but the risk is low, others would be buying in like crazy.
If you want to take that risk, go for it. Just don't be surprised if you lose a chunk of it.


You're in a fantastic situation and you can probably tolerate that risk. Nice!


For you, go for it. For others who only have $100 disposable income monthly, I don't recommend going all in on crypto.

At first thought it seems the price will rise at halvening.
But then again there are smart people who will buy into it 1 day before the halvening to maximize results.
But then people will speculate on them the day before that.
Me? I'm speculating on that 700 days before it happens :)
Halvenings are more of a symbolic thing, which stirs up news articles, gets newer and less experienced investors to try and figure out what this whole event is about. That's why I think the prices go up around halvening time.

Yes. I think it is less of a gamble now. Features don't drive price, public realization of WHAT the technology does is what may be pushing the value.

I honestly don't think Bitcoiners need to do much in terms of convincing lawmakers to "allow" anything.
Bitcoin is a protocol; a series of mathematical and code-based rules that anyone can follow.
Regulation (even positive regulation that allows it to be treated in such ways) kinda stifles the free nature of open-source protocol. Why don't we let it grow and grow and see where it goes? I'd rather have fewer laws regulating how Bitcoin must be interpreted than more.

I am, but some people are recklessly investing in crypto when 10% is the money leftover after life expenses. Just echoing a concept that you shouldn't just invest 10% and assume you're going to be fine. If you only have 10% to invest, do 9% traditional investments and 1% crypto.


Yes. Traditional markets follow growth within the world. If you believe all value is going to just go to Bitcoin and not things like tech development, communications, food &amp; farming, healthcare, legal work, construction, trade, transportation, etc., then you have no idea how the world works. Perhaps things will change from traditional ways, but you're sounding like the people who said in the 90s that internet would take over everything, yet we still have food &amp; farming, healthcare, legal work, construction, trade, transportation, etc.
Crypto will most likely step into the payment and store of value ecosystems, but you'll use it to buy food, and look at that, a market emerged where value can be attributed to food. If you own a stake in food operations, you're invested in a market.
The stock market isn't going anywhere soon, and if it does, you have a lot more to worry about than cryptocurrency making you rich.

Because you could encourage a mining pool to contribute 5X the total hashing power on something like BSV or BCH and rewrite blocks to do serious damage via double-spending.
If you have 5X the mining power, you could sell a TON of BCH to people at below-market price, then once that has 6 confirmations (1 hour of time), go batshit crazy with your mining pool and re-mine from 10 blocks ago, so you effectively re-write the transaction where you gave someone money and instead send it to yourself. Once you outpace the miners, you get your coins back. Rinse and repeat several times until you've effectively sold your coins 5X over.
Imagine that at any point the blocks could be re-written, and your accepted payment was cancelled?

But again and again we see people crying about how it isn't fair and how exchanges should do things to protect their investment, or how it should be illegal. Wow, you're one to change sides once the rule-free ecosystem no longer fits your narrative.
I get so angry at the hipocricy of this, but I gotta accept it since that's also what decentralized is about. You can be hypocritical as much as you like. Just remember, it doesn't change the protocol :)

Consider selling $800k or so. $500k into super safe, diverse funds to slowly grow over the next couple decades and for kids. Sell another $200k to put $100k towards the house, $100k for maintenance, taxes, and other expenses. $100k for the capital gains tax and hiring a property professional to handle this.
While Bitcoin may go insanely high, putting a good $700k towards a safety net will work wonders for your life and you'll still have the majority in Bitcoin.
You could sell another $500k for diverse investments and safely withdraw 3% from it almost indefinitely. That's an extra $15k annually for life. That could cover rent and possibly a couple low end vacations every year.

This is such a valuable piece of advice.
Eating right means consuming fresh produce, reducing carb intake, avoiding processed crap, and removing sugar from your diet if possible.
Exercising should be some basic cardio like running, stretching, being active through things like hiking or sports, and being mindful of your body's needs.
 I'm no Bitcoin millionaire, but I've made some stellar life improvements over the past few years. If you need motivation to run, pop in an Andreas Antonopolous video on your phone and run for the duration of the video. Being physically active while pushing your brain also does wonder for information retention.
You've only got one life to live, and if Bitcoin is going to improve your life you want to be healthy enough to do so.

Private keys control the movement of Bitcoin within that wallet.
You steal my private key and move the Bitcoin to your wallet where only you know the private key. You now control it exclusively. All I know is that the coins were sent to a new address. There's no username, address, ID, etc.
Now, I could watch where all the coins go and if I find a receiving address that's from a company or person I know, I could start to investigate. But at the same time that's an incredible amount of effort for someone to say "yeah I sold a toy I shipped to Australia. He got the Bitcoin from a neighbor's friend in exchange for car repair who got that money from the sale of a pet. And they don't ID their customers so it could be anyone at this point."

You do 5 minutes of research, you get trapped in the zero-knowledge situation and make uninformed decisions.

I've given 3 presentations at businesses for free, and they loved learning the absolute basics of how it works. I've been in contact with a few legal firms and they have shown interest.

I wouldn't buy $5 weekly, as fees will really hurt you in the long run. Do $20-$25 every month, or just buy like $300 for the year if you feel comfortable doing so. Otherwise you buy $5 and $2 gets taken out as fees, so your $3 of BTC needs to grow 1.5X in value just to break even on the fees, but then you also need to factor the fees to sell it if you choose to do so.

2mb, 4mb, 8mb are all fine. It's when people start wanting 32gb blocks that we face a problem.
The idea is for Bitcoin to progress out of necessity. Block size definitely needs to go up slowly, but unless there is an overwhelming consensus, the size won't go up.
I propose block size doubling at every halving.

A price correction is much different than a bubble. A bubble bursting would mean months of price growth would be removed in a tiny amount of time by comparison, like 2 days.
If it took Bitcoin 4 days to grow from 9k to 11k, then over the next 2 days it reduces to 9k, that's not a bubble. A bubble popping would be if Bitcoin climbed from 5k to 11k over 5 months then reduced to 4k in a matter of a week.
We use the term "bubble" way too liberally these days. Hyper-sensational terminology benefits no one.

I got "burned" at the $1k crash. This was a huge lesson for me, but a friend who was a financial genius (was gobbling these up when they were $50 each) told me the tech didn't change and the supply remained.

Could you do 2 weeks of mining at this difficulty? Remember, it will take MUCH longer to mine 2 weeks of blocks at the current difficulty. You have 51 days to catch up on 14 days of mining, so you'd need roughly 1/3 of the global hashrate.

* Bitcoin is like email when this whole internet thing was starting to pick up. That was ONE application. Over time we improved things so we could visit static pages, share music, stream video, synchronize two gamestates, etc.
* Bitcoin cannot meet scaling demands thrown in front of it right now. Scaling usually is a response to clogged pipes. And that's okay.
* Society gets by just fine without crypto (for most countries at least)
* The protocol is too hard to use at current state. We need developers to work on UI and ease of use

Double the block size at each halving.
That's my scaling proposal.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:02:03
I want to add, most of us see the need for big blocks, but allow me to explain my personal thought process:
Bitcoin is going to scale in 2 ways at the same time; userbase and transaction frequency. I think we can agree that adoption rate among people is going to grow exponentially. Now allow me to explain how transaction frequency will play a role:
Using Bitcoin, big transactions work. Smaller transactions can work, and we're getting better and better at it. From what I can tell, big block fans want to scale block size to meet the demand of buying a cup of coffee. Let's call that a microtransaction. What about nanotransactions? Eventually, I want to be able to pay per ever 100 milliseconds of video streaming. This means making the block size MUCH larger to hold all 200,000 transactions in my streaming session. We're talking about gigabyte blocks. Maybe even terabytes at some point? That's every 10 minutes.
This is guaranteed to outpace who can support a node. Sure, we can prune nodes, but that can also compromise accumulated proof of work if not all of the proof of work is in every node.
On top of scaling block size to meet nanotransactions of people, you also must realize that not only will adoption rise exponentially, but what about the Internet of Things where every device connected to the internet uses its own wallet and does 200,000 transactions per activity? What do we do when we reach exabyte sized blocks?
In this scenario, we have two exponential factors of growth and only one exponential response. We can never win if we continue to do this.
Instead, our proposed solution is to condense the transactions off chain and summarize the exchange in the blockchain. This way, no matter how many transactions we have going, we only have to summarize. My 200,000 transactions per activity can be summarized in one single transaction, and then we can take BUNDLES of 200,000 transactions, summarize them, and condense 500 activities into a single transaction on the blockchain.
Now let's look at the benefits from increasing the block size from 1mb to 2mb. You don't get a 2X increase in capacity, but you get an exponentially large growth factor because you can double the number of summary transactions happening via lightning or another offchain solution.
I think a good analogy is to compare credit card transactions. You don't go to a deli and buy each individual item with a credit card (sandwich, soda, bag of chips). You bundle them into one single charge and that charge summarizes the amount owed. The "summary" of the transaction happens on the credit card network while the cash register combines all the transactions into one single summary. A "big block" solution would be to tell the credit card company to buy more servers because customers want to buy more products at these stores.

You need super-specialized computers (not your "really good" gaming PC), ultra-cheap electricity, and some knowledge in setting this stuff up.

So, first off quantum computers are good at breaking prime factorization. Bitcoin uses additional encryption, so your wallet would only be vulnerable if you didn't implement a precautionary measure where two forms of encryption are used, and the 2nd method is not breakable with quantum computing.
Second off, there is already a series of implementations in the cryptography works dealing with quantum-proof encryption. It could easily be applied to the Bitcoin code and it would probably ab easy transition

A lot of the time, when people care more about your investment or choice in life than their own life, they're trying to drag you down to their level. They're the "expert" and the possibility of them being wrong would destroy their ego. So they want you to get out of a potentially life changing investment that they refuse to accept as legitimate.

If your node is pruned, you are not representing the full proof of work. Bigger blocks exclude participants from running full nodes.
One key component of Bitcoin is keeping the ENTIRE ledger on every node. I can give 500gb, but I can't give 4tb.

Let's say you have a legal contract built around a transaction. Using CPFP(child pays for parent), you make an entirely new transaction that is not mentioned in the contract.
This is a weird and unusual case, but if I can make a somewhat valid use case for the existence of this pool, I'm sure we'll find many more uses after Bitcoin evolves over the years.

Mostly because people want "summary" information of an investment. They don't want to think, but rather be given specific instructions on how to get rich. That is the American mentality, at least.
So now we have these people who buy after seeing the price rise for like a week straight. They think it has to keep rising for no intelligent reason.
Then their plan gets a small hiccup, and they don't have the knowledge of Bitcoin, or even investing 101, to understand what's going on, so they get pissed and freak out when they don't immediately make a profit.
When I explain Bitcoin to people, I often get interrupted by people who don't care to learn how it works or WHY it is a great investment. They don't really care how it works, what it stands for, or even why they should invest in this. They only know that some people got filthy rich off of Bitcoin, and now they want to do that too, but "without the risk, please and thank you"
tl;dr: People only care about "winning" instead of working hard and making an effort to understand an investment/speculation. Can't tell you how many people tell me "I don't really want to learn how Bitcoin works, I just want to get rich from it". These are the people who are gonna get played HARD.

you only need to worry about this if you are spending Bitcoin in the near future. If you're holding your coins for longterm, just sit tight and learn as the process unfolds.
If you want to try to embrace an opportunity by selling the 2x tokens to buy more Bitcoin (or for govt cash), take your time and do excessive research. I don't believe in 2x, but I'm not selling any coins at the moment. I still have my bitcoincash, and I'll be keeping this and probably Bitcoin Gold as well. All I really care about is the actual Bitcoin I have. The rest will act as a bonus until I am 100% certain I want to get rid of them.

But that's ONLY if he/she can get the coins at a lower price.
A market consists of buyers and sellers. If a whale sells that doesn't trigger Coinbase to magically lower the price. It instead matches buyers with sellers and executes the exchange. The price is a result of where the buy prices and sell prices meet. If a match can't be found, buyers raise their price or sellers lower their price, often by a few cents, until a match is found.

The second you start buying it up, the price rises. Many of us won't sell until the prices get incredibly high. The more supply you remove from the pool, the higher the price goes. They would need trillions upon trillions of dollars to buy up even something like 15%.


The government wouldn't risk devaluing their currency that much just to buy Bitcoin.


Been involved in monetary policy for quite a while. I am aware of this. Our inflation rate is around 2%. It encourages economic activity. Do I agree with it? Kinda.


Yeah, that's an issue I have as well. But have you considered the consequences of if they didn't do that?


Sure. And they do. I'm more of a "long term" kinda guy. These waves will settle eventually.

Mining is building a bundle of transactions into the ledger. You must perform calculations on that block to arrive at a small output number called a "hash output". The specific hash function is called sha256.
These calculations are intensive, and prevent someone else from overwriting the ledger's entries.

The majority of people recommend a Trezor or a Nano Ledger.
I prefer the Trezor because it was invented by a dude named Slush. He's an OG in the Bitcoin space, and when I was doing pool-mining with their mining pool, I felt like they respected their miners, asking them to vote, providing information, sharing resources, etc.
Slush is good people. His company is great. Trezor is my device of choice.

Consider the following:
* Modern day mining gear will probably run you close to $1,000 upfront for a single machine that earns maybe $10 per day
* Your earnings in Bitcoin will be probably 10x less than your electricity bill (so expect to burn $100 of electricity every day to earn $10)
* It'll take about 8 hours to fully get a mining process up and running if you're decently skilled in I.T.
* You should be monitoring your mining gear at least once every 4 hours
If you're getting free electricity, it might be worth it. Otherwise, you're going to lose money UNLESS the price skyrockets. However, at that price you could probably just buy that much in Bitcoin and have WAY more Bitcoin than you'd ever be able to earn.
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:41:38
Here's some solid advice for noobs:
* Not your private keys not your bitcoin
* You can't mine profitably anymore. You can mine for fun, but $10 of electricity might award you $0.10 in a month
* Altcoins are not guaranteed to rise in price like Bitcoin (but some altcoins are worth learning about to help distinguish what Bitcoin can and cannot currently do)
* The more you learn about how this stuff works, the lower the chance of you being scammed
* Learn how to get your Bitcoin out of exchanges so you actually control your money
* If you're going to buy Bitcoin, don't buy it and then freak out if the price dips 5% in a week. So many people buy it and constantly expect to make profits 100% of the time. That was merely your observation from casually observing Bitcoin. Big holders can lose thousands of dollars per day, but they don't sell in a panic
* dollar cost averaging is the best way to invest if you have limited knowledge or time to invest into the environment
* Assume everyone wants to take your money, because they probably do

Do you think TCP/IP is the most efficient way to send data over the internet? Nope. But we still use it because it would be a nightmare to get everyone to migrate en masse.
Bitcoin has the already existing network size, support, attention from developers, recognition, and layers developing.
Any new alt coin that shows up will be:
* Pre-mined to death
* Price-manipulated to death
* Socially attacked by people with the goal of profiting from this
* Regulated by governments who "want to make sure their citizens are safe"
* Built to suit the needs of one entity, be it individual, company, country, etc.

Bitcoin Cash's end game appears to be large blocks. At some point, it becomes impossible for most people to run nodes due to a reasonably expected 1TB of storage space per year.
Nodes are necessary to trust your transactions 100%. If only the richest players can have nodes, they can reject blocks if the miner doesn't play by the expectations of node runners. Imagine if only corporations such as Chase or Visa could run nodes. They might feel compelled to reject blocks that weren't assembled by their own "approved" miners.
We need a 2nd layer scaling solution before we raise block size, and we should keep block size to a size limit where most people can participate with a node.

Let's say you want to invest in a home 5 years from now. You could pay $200k now or you could pay $20k for buying rights for the house in 5 years at a set rate. You're not 100% sure you want to live here but you want to lock in a home in the area before prices quadruple in this up and coming town. If the town flops and crashes you can walk away losing only $20k.
That's the general idea.

Supposedly, we should see the free market stabilizing the price. I think rising prices means one of two things:
* bubble is forming
* the value is still being found. Not sure how much that value is, but if we are not in a bubble, it looks like the value is certainly much much higher than it is now
Also remember, this is the first of its kind. We are constantly seeing upgrades, new users, innovation being built AROUND bitcoin, cultural growth into the field, etc.
This is the first of many that will use consensus algorithms to figure out truth in the most reliable way. Worst case scenario we simply have a learning platform that will change the pathway of computer science forever.

The sum of the two forked coins sums up to roughly 7600. This is not a coincidence.
The price shifts are not due to people either a.) Getting out of one ecosystem or b.) Getting into one ecosystem(heck, you can't even buy the forked coin easily)

By all means, if it does become a mainstream payment method, use it! Make it so popular it gets caught up in crime and regulated to death.
Then people will see what happens when they start flipping monetization switches to pay for costs of complying with regulation, and also paying themselves a profit to solve this problem (which was never a problem with Bitcoin in the first place).
That may be what finally drives Bitcoin to the Moon, because commerce will be so integrated into programmable sound money and people will favor a crypto that doesn't integrate a profit model.

What if JP Morgan claims they have $500 quadrillion dollars? How can we tell?
You audit bank accounts, so you audit receiving addresses. You can sign a message via any receiving address and people can verify it exists.
I could verify my receiving addresses by providing encrypted code that my receiving address unlocks. You could use my receiving address to descramble the code as "this is zomgitsduke claiming the contents of this wallet to be mine"
Organizations will definitely fake how much they have, but when that becomes discovered, there will be a value for actually showing what you own.
Once a few companies get caught, singing a message will be a social requirement before any claims of owning BTC are accepted.

When the price was skyrocketing, all people cared about was the price. Nothing about the features, development, attitude, solutions, technical details, etc.
But now that the price settled down and the sensationalist investors backed off (for now), devs had time to actually build into the ecosystem. Lightning is... breathtaking (as long as it can keep improving) as a potential payment network. Schnorr signatures make me incredibly optimistic at the moment. And I've heard some things about coins exchanging hands in even more efficient ways as well, which really interests me. Furthermore, what's going to happen if/when layer 3 protocols emerge?
We've got front row seats to some truly impressive stuff. I tell people all the time that BTC is nowhere near done, and I'm optimistic that we have yet to see the true potential of this stuff, much like how early internet was seen as a "neat alternative to fax machines", yet we not us the internet to play games synchronized with our friends, stream on-demand video, share images, tap into live data feeds, etc.

I've been watching the sum of both prices. It sat around $7600ish the whole time. At one point, the sum broke $8000 and the shift happened back into BTC. This wasn't a coincidence. Ran it by some finance guys and they thought that was curious, because if it were a steady stream from one coin to another, we would see the price stay pretty stagnant, not increase...
I've been trying to say this for a while. I stopped being worried about the shift for a while now. Tried to post it here but that didn't work :/
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:27:27
We only have one case study. The value dipped at first but skyrocketed after. Also, you get value in Bitcoin cash.
We'll probably have a dip after the fork, on both ends. This is due to people selling to cash out on either side. Most people also don't buy right after free money is given out; they hopefully invest before that event to get both sides... If they do research

I don't understand why everyone thinks a decentralized is without difficulties.
You know who isn't affected by this forking BS? Hodlers. Hold both sides of the fork. If you want to take a risk and sell one half of the fork, be my guest and take that risk. I still hold my Bitcoin cash, not because I believe in it, but I'm holding ALL my coins on ALL the forks.

Not yet. We just recently moved from "lunatic early adopter" phase to "early adopter" phase.
We still have the pre-mainstream adoption phase, where the writing is on the wall and even experts are saying to get into Bitcoin &amp; other crypto at 25% portfolio or more.
Then it will become mainstream when almost everyone uses it, understands how to send it, and the real job opportunities come forward. A country will probably adopt it as their only currency, as it's just easier that way.
At each phase, rich people will be made from the ones who joined at the prior phase. If you are in for multiple phases, your richness will escalate by an order of magnitude. But in order for this to truly happen, you must introduce Bitcoin to the economy. Spend in small amounts here and there, and consider diversifying your portfolio when Bitcoin becomes the dominant holding.

There are many ways to record a seed via writing it down.
Take each word and shift them forward by 1 letter. CAT becomes DBU. First work gets shifted by 1 letter, second word 2 letters, 3rd word 3 letters, etc.
Now mush all those words together into a single line of text. Put that on the back of a family photo with hundreds others and lock it in a fireproof safe.
You can also take a photo of it and place it with hundreds of photos to be put on a flash drive. If you can encrypt a flash drive, awesome! Put that encrypted file in a password protected zip file and give it to family you can trust.

Mass adoption of the internet happened way after people used it to send messages. Rarely does a protocol adhere to the exact specifications of the creator.
Internet is more than the initial desire to send research data across a network. It's a way to share culture, educate, communicate, play games, and even launch marketplaces ontop of it.
Bitcoin is definitely a store of value, but it's also going to be a payment network. AND it's going to do tons more things we neevr thought of.
The magic isn't in the tech, but rather the distributed nature of the tech.
Bitcoin as a financial system will make mockery of everything that came before it, just like email allowed us to circumvent the inconvenience of using physical paper and waiting 2-3 days. But again, internet opened so much more.

But that's just me. Others will love to tell you to recklessly invest all your money into BTC because they want everyone to be "all in" (chances are these internet strangers with so much confidence aren't as heavily allocated as they want you to be).
And I wouldn't use that allocation unless you really understand how Bitcoin works. Like, can you send and receive BTC? Do you know what hardware wallets are? Do you understand what really makes Bitcoin anonymous? Can you differentiate a "node" from a "wallet"? Do you understand how inflation in fiat systems work? Do you understand how exactly a cap of 21m coins exists?

Sounds crazy? That's what you sound like.
It isn't about trying to teach everyone about "the revolution". Instead, be there as a source of knowledge for those curious enough. Be able to explain it in a simpler way that they can understand. Don't just jump into panic mode. Don't try to get them to adopt your mindset through fear.
Here is the best way I've been able to present it:
"Bitcoin is a tech project that tried to solve a neat mathematics/computation problem. They succeeded further than anyone else had at solving the problem. People realized that Bitcoin could take on value due to being scarce. Then they realized if it had value, it also served as a payment medium, and could do so for dirt cheap (no 3.5% merchant fees like credit cards). People also realized that this could become programmable money and really change how we view money.
Today's money works, but some day it might not... just like at one point the horse solved all of the problems at the time but now we have cars and insane highways built from innovation.
This Bitcoin thing is worth learning about. I'm not saying you should buy $20,000 worth of Bitcoin, but rather give it a try. So, sign up for an exchange and buy $10 to play with, or let's go through the steps of installing a Bitcoin wallet and I'll give ya a few bucks to play around with."
Let the seeds be planted before you start talking about the harvest. Let them learn some things on their own. Let them bring their findings to you so you can clarify and help them learn more.
Chill out dude, if you come off as pushy it appears more and more like a scam or MLM to people, especially when presented in such an urgent and panicked way.

Find an allocation that fits your beliefs vs risk tolerance.
Are you certain BTC is going to the moon? Like, "bet the farm" certain? Didn't think so.
I'm 10% allocated in my savings/retirement fund. In my opinion this is an extremely reckless position to take unless you've truly done enough research that you can truly say you understand how it works. I've read most of the books recommended, participated here for years, tested over 10 wallets, and given lectures about what Bitcoin is and how it works.
So please, don't be reckless. You should have your traditional finances in order first before you touch this stuff. Roth IRA, 401k (if you believe in it as a viable retirement account, I don't), 3-6 months emergency funds, and all non-necessary debts paid off (mortgage, 0-3% APR car loan, student loans &gt; 5% count as necessary).
Good luck all. Just because your reckless bet was the optimal one, it doesn't mean you were "right". So none of that BS where you give me the "i told you so" lecture. I could recommend a person not spend their last $200 on lotto tickets and they could still "be right".

The fork is definitely contributing, but maybe not how you think.
In a fork, everyone now wants to get their coins out of exchanges. As a result, these exchanges lose a lot of their reserves, which lowers supply. Exchanges have to buy, especially if they're operating on fractional reserves.
So yeah, it comes to more users, but also old users withdrawing their Bitcoin and drying up the pool.

My issue is that every reputable web-based platform understands the importance for responsive scaling. No longer are we in the days when a service  should go down because too many people want to use it. We can scale a service to run with 100 customers, or 1,000,000 customers.
And this is especially true in a system using a trustless currency. How can I know more influential customers didn't have a priority channel to buy/sell their funds while I had to sit there refreshing the site for the hope of accessing their services?

This is building optimism, especially when an exchange proves they can do granular micro-transactions.

They should not import it. They should sweep it.
Importing leaves the coins with that private key. Sweeping moves it to a brand new wallet, so the private key is not known by anyone but the owner of the wallet.

Thing is, I know very little as well. I have invested in ethereum, but more in Bitcoin.
If we look at the early days of the internet, we had more phone engineers working to make a smart network smarter than those working on the internet. The devices on the end were dumb, so those devices had to adhere to the network rules.
Bitcoin's network is dumb and simple, but will have smart items at the edges. Huge difference in terms of how things can be innovated.
At some point ethereum may hit a wall that limits what it can do, mostly because the original idea restricts how it can act within certain parameters. Bitcoin, being super simple, allows innovation to flare out at the edge of the network and take it in new directions.
Let's see what happens.

Because we can't just let the system run itself. Part of being decentralized is giving all users of the system a say. In a centralized system, the masses lose power to the controller.

I agree 100%. But if this technology kicks off like the internet, the level of innovation and weirdness being applied to the network could make a lot of network behavior where this tight-knit case gets used 500,000 per day.

Blocks will most likely fill up. Once they do and fees get too expensive, people will hopefully migrate to Lightning (or maybe other solutions as well?). This should rebalance the costs a bit to find a free-market value of a fair price to transact. Lightning will keep scaling and making that cheaper and cheaper, hopefully.
Does that mean we never have to increase block size? I'm not sure. I would support a VERY conservative and slow paced increase of block size, because doing something as simple as increasing block size by 1% could open up a dramatically larger increase in capacity (and decrease in cost) over Lightning.
Full blocks don't really mean problems as much since we have lightning.
@_date: 2019-04-17 21:32:24
Yup. When I start getting my discounts upfront instead of 2-5% rewards, I'll use lightning.

There are some hurdles to test out, but once you get a channel up and running it's pretty awesome :)
So when I set it up, I connected to an ACINQ node and requested liquidity from the node, meaning I could receive from the node as well as send. It cost me a small amount of money to set it up, but was totally worth it in my eyes. If you don't, you need to spend X satoshi in order to receive X satoshi. For a coffee shop, this seems fine though as you'd just keep recharging it as you need.

Even if it's used for major things like paying bills as they come, bitcoin will see more and more use.
We can still use credit cards, it will just take 10 minutes to pay the final bill at the end of the billing cycle.
The cool thing about it could be that I'll pay the bill via bitcoin, and a friend pays his share by transferring btc directly to my credit card's associated wallet address. His share gets deducted from my card balance when the transaction clears.
No more third party apps like venmo, no more writing about weird transfers or holding mental debts among friends. Others can pay parts of my credit card bill and I'll never even notice the difference.

Hardware cold wallets require a button to be pushed in order to ship a signed transaction via the USB cable to the PC using it.
When you plug your hardware wallet into a PC, you configure something like a "request file" that gets transferred to your hardware wallet. This "request file" can only ask for a signed transaction via your private keys. Private keys NEVER find their way to the PC. Your hardware wallet uses the private keys to create a signed transaction to a specific address, and won't return it to the PC without a physical button being pressed (and a confirmation on the screen that you actually want this transaction to be sent).
Think of it this way: You need a form to be stamped by the DMV. There are two ways this can happen:
1. You bring your form into the DMV where you hand them the form through a bulletproof glass window, they read over the documents, decide if they will stamp it or not, then hand it back to you.
2. A DMV employee comes over to your house to review the documents and stamp the form if they find you to be in good standing.
In scenario 2, you could end up attacking the employee and stealing the stamp, and now you would be able to approve all sorts of different forms.
In scenario 1, you had no way of obtaining the stamp.
In this scenario, the bulletproof glass DMV is the hardware wallet and the employee coming to your house is the USB stick.

For all practical purposes, it can (and probably should) be used as a payment system where you can leave money in it but withdraw it regularly into a wallet.
The lower fees are due to not taking up block space. Unfortunately, with transaction fees, you can either allow a free market to discover the true value, or you can elect someone to decide which transactions are allowed. It is obvious the path BTC has to take. The other solution is to expand block size, which I personally think should be done with extreme caution. Slight increasing of block size over time allows almost everyone to still run a node.
Transaction fees are what they are. If it excludes people, a solution has at least been found and implemented to include more and more people. If they aren't foolish enough to use multichannel parties, they will be fine.

It needs to have much less risk, easier use, minimal startup, etc.
Look back on all other types of financial tools. Credit cards were an amazing progress but most people just wanted to use cash or check. Eventually, cards became super easy to use.
I think we need a super easy system to hold and distribute bitcoin, a steady rise in price so more people feel the need to invest in it (even something reliable like 1% per month for a year to trigger fear of missing out), major businesses utilizing bitcoin publicly, and a reason to use bitcoin over credit cards that actually justify use (I can't justify using bitcoin to buy something when I get 5% cash back on certain purchases).

Good question.
So, every 10 minutes, specialized computers bundle transactions into a "block" in order to try to win the reward (currently 12.5 BTC). They win by completing a game that has to do with solving a puzzle at a "difficulty" that adjusts every 2 weeks. Basically, when you win, you announce it and you receive the reward, and everyone goes after the next block. This adjustment is what averages out the time between blocks to 10 minutes.
You may notice that the reward gets cut in half every 4 years. This was the initial system to get people to participate. In addition to these rewards, you have to also leave a small tip for miners to include your transaction in the blocks. Since there is limited space, a 0-cost transaction could be done 1000000000000000 times per block and lock everyone out. So how do we solve this? We make it so that a transaction allows money to be left as a "tip" for the miners to include your transaction over someone else's. We could expand block size, but that gets complicated and doesn't solve the issue of spamming trillions of 0-fee transactions.
So when the reward runs out, miners will now depend on these small fees to give them incentive to run their mining operation. Since difficulty can change, we have a free flowing market where there will always be someone willing to claim these fees.

I would say the initial ~200GB of blocks are going to make storage and syncing of nodes somewhat difficult.

The block size should be steadily increased slowly over time. Like, painfully slow, but still with expansion carefully done over time.
Expand it enough to expand capacity, but keep it at a small enough rate to stay well under Moore's Law.
My proposal is 12.5% increase every 4 years, opposite of each halvening, so we get one of those two things to happen every 2 years.
Edit: Before the downvotes of "BIG BLOCK BAD BOO", please consider my proposal is a 1/8 growth every other year, where as Moore's Law predicts 2X growth in that same time period. This constantly keeps the growth scaled by a much lower exponential rate of growth. Is it perfect? No. It's a concept I'd like to discuss before y'all break out the pitchforks.

No, that's not how it works.
Credit is NECESSARY for economies to work. You borrow money to build something and pay back more money later to reward investors.
You want to start a business? You probably won't have the $250,000 needed to rent a building, buy gear, hire employees, and operate for a while to build up profits.
Credit cards are taking out such a loan, except for day-to-day life. You don't create the money, but rather the credit card company pays the bill and holds you liable for the cost (and interest if you don't immediately pay it off within the month).
No money is being created. You need to learn how credit cards work before posting crap like this.

In short: More sellers than buyers.
When people invest, they look at percentage gained over time. If you can make 5% profit over a year, cool! But if you can make 3% in 3 months that's even better. Lots of people invest in Bitcoin to sell it and take the profits, so the price will dip at times when "whales", or people who have large amounts of money use it to invest. They can influence the price quite easily with a large investment or large selloff of bitcoin.
If you're invested in Bitcoin, you need to realize your strategy. Will you invest shortly for a quick small profit, or are you in it for the long run? I personally will be holding my investments for the long haul, as I believe the value will go way up.
Remember, prices don't go up because everyone sits here and agrees on what bitcoins are worth, but rather prices go up when more people want Bitcoin than those willing to sell, and as result, buyers must offer more money until they find someone willing to sell at that price.

You always have the same % of all possible Bitcoin. Just like land, gold (arguably deflationary), and other limited edition things, your value increases as you hold onto it. Inflationary isn't necessarily BAD, but too much can be, and when governments have the ability to use inflationary measures to pay their bills, it becomes a problem. See Venezuela, Cyprus, Greece, Ukraine, etc.
It isn't necessarily "better", just different. A good economy will support diverse currencies and adjust to each strength/weakness.


The price in USD will most likely go up. Think about it; every year there are more US Dollars while there will only be 21M BTC. If we are to consider exchange rates between the two, and USD price doesn't change, you could theoretically buy more than 21M BTC.


Sure, but how will they pay for their electricity bills? And new mining gear? And workers to maintain the warehouse? They will have to pay in BTC.
This is called growth, where capitalists risk money in the hopes of making more money. Some will succeed, some will fail.
We also will probably not depend 100% on BTC for everything. We will have other currencies still. We will have land, metals, cars, etc serving as points of value. Bitcoin will just serve as one way to park wealth.
Bitcoin also serves as a check for reckless governments. It basically says "show any signs of hyperinflating your currency and people will drop it faster than you can print it", thus killing the government's power of printing their money.


When the last bits are mined, there will still be mining fees issued. And honestly, if Bitcoin lasts until the year 2140(last bit mined), it's a wonderful tool that lived the course. Could live further on as well, or it could dissolve way before then to a superior currency.

The dust settles after a major crash. The toxic investors left, and the innovators had time to focus on building quality into the ecosystem. Lightning came. Lightning works. Lightning is dirt cheap, so for most practical purposes you can send BTC over lightning for next to nothing.
World economies are acting scary. Some country governments are abusing the financial systems for immediate gains in power and reward for themselves.
If you want to invest, buy slow and boringly. Got a bad habit? Try to quit it by funneling half of those funds into BTC (and other crypto if you desire). Save the rest.

Somewhat. Every company with KYC may not be directly trying to track your BTC, but they have extensive records and can trace where the coins go.
Your BTC will be safe, but you may be a target in the event of a data leak.
Ways you can make your coins appear less likely to still be in your possession:
* Do not use the same receiving address multiple over and over again. That becomes obvious.
* Do not send rounded amounts like 0.1 BTC. Send stuff like 0.174923 BTC
* Consider having 2 or more wallets. They can all be used on one hardware wallet (or buy multiple). This adds diversity to your holdings.
* Mixing BTC can be illegal in some areas, but maybe not in other places. Make sure you trust these if you go down this route.
There isn't really a way to perfectly secure this info, except for buying in-person with cash... which may also be illegal in some areas.
You're probably fine, as most of us do buy through a KYC compliant exchange.

@_date: 2017-04-19 14:43:52
I think the Bitcoin environment has enough competition against it to dissuade any monopoly.
Think about it, Bitcoin gets controlled by one entity and starts to underperform. If this happens, investors leave the market, devs move to a crypto that doesn't limit their goals, and Bitcoin price tanks. When all the attention leaves Bitcoin, we see those monopoly holders losing massive profits. If those monopoly holders put in a large financial investment, we see them operating at a loss.
I hope someone smart enough to run a monopoly can see this.
That's the environment though, and we all signed up for this. Decentralized means there is no appointed entity at the birth of the technology, but people CAN take over it. It would be extremely expensive and probably fail many, many times, but we are taking such a risk.

First, I don't think this is the time to be angry or mad at your kiddo. He may not know what he's doing, just like you.
First, have him stop doing this until he can explain the following:
* Who is sending him the cash?
* What is he doing that offers so much trust to just ship him money?
* How does Bitcoin play a role in this?
* Does your son know of anything illegal or unethical happening?
* What service(s) is/are being used to facilitate this transfer of money?
You need to understand what he is doing. It is possible this is legal, but also possible that it is not legal.
My guess is that this IS illegal and needs to be stopped. But at the same you want to be a good parent and help your kid understand the risks/problems associated with this instead of just saying no.
Bitcoin is a digital currency that lives on the internet. It CAN be used for unethical things because there is no company or entity in control over it; it just simply serves as a way to transfer digital coins from one person to another (and these coins are actually scarce, which gives them value).
Feel free to keep asking us questions. We may be able to help you and your son learn more about the currency and avoid illegal things.

Hey dude, as others have noted, you didn't actually buy Bitcoin. Robinhood allows you to secure BTC in their custody, so you can sell it for cash later.
You don't own that Bitcoin until it is moved from custodial holders into your own private keys.

It would indeed encourage all layers. However, I don't like the concept of shrinking blocks to do this. Instead, I'd like to hear a firm stance such as "We do not support any increases in block size from now on".

Litecoin doesn't yet have a scaling problem because it doesn't have massive adoption to capacity. 
Being lightning-ready means when the coin gets adopted massively, there won't be a problem with scaling. Therefore, once litecoin gathers momentum, less obstacles stand in the way just as it starts to accelerate.
Litecoin will have an expected problem solved before said problem can surface. More incentive for people to put money into it because it won't hit some of the BS that Bitcoin has been facing.

I wouldn't be surprised if we held a node with a "trust" level, which is basically the number of blocks in history it holds.
Your phone node could have a trust level of 144 and that should be fine for most uses. It eats up 2MB of data every 10 minutes, which doesn't seem too bad, especially if it only syncs when it hits WiFi.
If we do employ Lightning as the more viable solution via phone usage, we will most likely end up with a small pruned node on our phones. Hell, you could even make a secure connection to your home node to verify things.
I'm excited to see where things go.

Very much against such an aggressive drop in block size. People were very much against a large increase in block size, why would anyone think just as wild of a decrease would be supported?
Want to trim block size slowly and conservatively? I'll listen to your reasons.
I also disagree with the concept of dropping block size to encourage lightning usage. What if Lightning isn't the only 2nd layer developed? Why should Lightning be the ONLY second layer, especially in the infancy of discussing such a new layer. And this is coming from someone who LOVES the Lightning Network.

Yes. Incorrect applications of lightning implementation can be a problem.
I put this on par with "paying" a merchant with the 12 word printed seed of private keys to a Bitcoin wallet. If the seller is dumb enough to accept this as payment and leave it in a safe for a few weeks, they deserve what happens to them. This scenario is about as "trustless" as a signing off on a 3 way lightning channel.

I found an interesting way to include a personal element to storing my passphrases.
I have a folder with a lot of images in it from various points in my life. A few of them are "out of place" in only a way I could really tell. Maybe they're from a horrible vacation, or maybe they have a weird person in it.
Either way, the words are photoshopped into the photo to resemble other elements of the pictures. Maybe I changed someone's name tag from work to one of the words, or maybe I photoshopped the word into a cloud formation. Maybe the stars in a photo resemble the word in an obscure way. Either way, you have to know how I think to know which photos are "off" in any way.
And good luck figuring out which folder of the hundreds I'm using. All of the photos are stored on several flash drives, and an encrypted file containing all the photos is on an online storage account for an email address that has no association with me.
My keys can be compromised, but my goodness it is not going to be an easy process.

Nodes confirm it, but miners bundle the next official record of account into a block.
Each confirmation beyond the first means the transaction has that many blocks on top of it. After 3 blocks you can assume your transaction is reliably secured. After 6 blocks it becomes ridiculously reliable. For anything over $1,000,000 I'd wait a full day just to be extremely confident.

Buying or owning crypto is NOT specializing, as you do not have skills to solve a problem. If you study crypto and learn how it works, you'll specialize in cryptography with currency application. THAT may be something worth having, but not simply owning it.
A lot of the misconceptions with crypto is that y'all are gonna be super rich for simply investing some money into the crypto... and you might if you're lucky, but you won't be marketable. No one is going to hire you for a task or job at a high pay (or even any pay) because you followed a tutorial online for how to secure 5 different cryptos. You might find yourself in high demand if you can differentiate each crypto, help a company decide on which ones to use, help establish a system that works for the company, or educate staff on the cryptos.
I've said this hundreds of times before, you should invest your mind into the crypto space more than your wallet. This is especially true if you believe it is the future

I think the initial fad of "buy crypto because it's the future, then sell it for money in the future" is over. I also find that mentality incredibly foolish.
That was a pretty bad approach to buying crypto. It assumes you never believed in it since you'd like to sell it back for fiat. But hey, you do you. This is called the "greater fool theory" as you think there will be a greater fool who will buy it from you for more, assuming someone will buy it from them for more.
If you think bitcoin or crypto isn't around to stay, sell now or assume the risks. Many of us see Bitcoin and other crypto being a financial tool in the future that may replace, or at least hurt, fiat money systems. We own Bitcoin to own Bitcoin.

That's a fair criticism, and I can't fault an opinion. I happen to disagree, but respect your point of view.
May I ask your opinion of the inefficiencies?
Also, I want to bring up the point that any crypto created today has the ability to be gamed at a low market cap. I'd love to hear your response. Again, don't take this as an attack, but rather a curious inquiry towards your thought process.

If it gets the job done, it can be made to work. TCP/IP is used for stuff like YouTube, and we've pushed the limits of it to serve all video needs.
The point is that other, inefficient ways have still found their placement in modern technology because of the network effect. If it's good enough that people can scale it to make it work, it's miles more convenient than rebuilding the entire system from scratch.
Tough to agree with, I know... but this is why we have Lightning Network, as it's a weird inefficient build on top of Bitcoin, but it works, and it will work well as we keep putting innovation into it. It would be a nightmare to rebuild an entire Bitcoin-like crypto, because everyone will push to make it behave in their best interests. It's too late to say "I'm going to build a better crypto with features I desire, and 99% of people will disagree because they won't abandon Bitcoin unless it satisfies all of their personal needs with none of the extra stuff.
That's my take on it, at least.

Not secret knowledge, but let's say you have a law enforcement branch training their employees in blockchain analysis, or you have another country running a small mining operation with excess energy?

This could trigger another space race type of scenario.
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:14:45
First off, you are well-versed in crypto, and I respect that knowledge a lot.


7 tps is horrible in my opinion as well. Lightning is a proposed solution, and I like it, but yeah there are still some hiccups I am concerned about. Paying high fees sucks too.
If we moved to 8MB, I suspect we would be excluding a lot of nodes. Every bump in block size raises the required RAM used in the process of verifying blocks, so 8MB would take quite a lot of RAM (I think close to 32GB if I am remembering correctly).
Having competing cryptos is also a good thing, because it keeps the cryptos in competition and focused. No stale periods when every other coin is going after first place.


Nano seems interesting, but I don't know enough to comment. Having a system where voting is trusted among reps seems a little scary to me, but then again I don't know the system.


I can agree with incentivized systems, but PoS scares me a little, as it gives wealthier participants more voting power. PoS might be better, but I haven't seen it in action.


I dislike XLM, but that's opinion. I agree with your point.


Bitcoin is currently loosely pseudonymous, which is okay for now. Lightning should hopefully open up privacy. In addition, mixers and other layers can be implemented ontop of Bitcoin's simple network. I like that Bitcoin is ultra-simple, as the layers ontop can improve. We do need higher privacy on Bitcoin's base layer at some point.


Currently, BTC will not handle the demands of global use (or even a country). However, as scaling improves I suspect we will see better and better improvements. The fact that Bitcoin isn't backed into a corner of complicated rules and behaviors is what gives me hope for it.


If a coin only has a $1B market cap, $10,000,000 can be used to rapidly fluctuate the price of the coin and seriously ruin the public perception of the coin. We could see a coin price rising in value quickly, we all buy in, and then the pump and dump concludes and we are all left with significantly less value for our coin. Anything at a smaller market cap is more vulnerable to this. Bitcoin has already moved towards a big cap, but we've still seen waves being made by whales. Imagine if whales wanted to pump and dump another coin... maybe something that's pumped to, let's say, $4 and back down to $0.70...
Dude, I enjoy having this convo with you, and I hope my perception and opinions help you as much as you helped me :)

Yeah, probably for a while. You could, however, run it on a hosted server with a good reputation, possibly mirror it across 3 platforms, and it one strays from the other 2, it shuts down on that end.

Yeah, bubbles happen. If you remove the spike in price the value has gone up steadily


People who don't trust a government to effectively do money. Additionally, this is programmable money that will have new utility.

I gave a speech about Bitcoin, set up 50 different paper wallets, each with $5 (billed an extra $250 for the speech "prop").
After the presentation I handed out a wallet to everyone and said "I have a copy of all of these wallets. By end of this week I'm taking back anything you don't move to a safe wallet that only you control." People were confused and asked me how to move it. I told them it was their homework.
I only claimed back about $175 of that money, so some people were able to claim the Bitcoin.

Excellent questions!
Okay, first off, miners can exclude transactions, but since no mining group controls 50% of the mining power, we have a scenario where there is less than a 50% chance of the transaction being denied at each 10 minute block. This also means that one single miner has to win consecutive blocks in a row to keep denying this transaction. After 1 hour, the odds of a miner winning all 6 blocks is less than 1/32, and the odds keep getting wilder and wilder.  Other miners will win blocks and include your transaction. If a major miner hates you, they'd have to be a major player to slightly inconvenience you.
Secondly, if miners are ignoring your transaction, you can always bump up the miner fee (small tip paid out to the miner to incentivize them to take your transaction), and miners would be dumb to ignore the free extra money. If they don't take a bumped up fee, another miner will. And that miner will profit more than the miner who doesn't want to include your fee. Once a miner starts making a large list of people to hate on, they are at a disadvantage in a hyper-competitive field. One last thing, once your transactions get carried out, the miner would THEN have to implement a system to analyze the blockchain and check the history of every single transaction before accepting it, all to hold a grudge against your transaction.

This is some solid advice.
It keeps the weak hands out. So many people invested in BTC to get rich, and now that the price growth is slower, people are getting impatient. They don't understand the technology and what it means.
Moreso than millionaires, we will see those who say "I could've been rich if I just held onto my Bitcoin, but I sold on a crash". It's already happened before. I recently met a guy who bought hundreds of BTC at a few pennies each, had a euphoric moment at the MT Gox crash, then panic-sold at something like $400 each. He still made a very very generous profit, but always wonders "what if". Instead of netting a cool $250k, he could have been a millionaire and retired at 34.
I see BTC as the Index Funds of crypto. Lots of stuff is tied to BTC, people like it, it has a good representation of the entire crypto space (40% dominance right now in a sea of over 1400 recognized cryptos), and the price will most likely track this pattern over the years.
We have people today who want the insane profits of BTC without the risks. They want to see a 500x investment return in a year, and get frustrated when that doesn't happen. Those that expect this and do not receive it will be very sorry when they sell. But more importantly, these people are not balancing their investment positions properly. Bitcoin and other crypto should AT MOST take up 15% of your portfolio, given you can stomach that type of risk tolerance. Anyone going in at 15% of their portfolio should either a.) understand how the technology works FULLY, meaning you can recite the basics of Mastering Bitcoin and have a full on conversation of the scaling debate and effectively explain what both sides want, or b.) have an ultra-diversified other 85% that will still net a return on their investment.
Most people have neither.

It is indeed a protocol. But at the same time, this is a protocol with a fixed supply of a digital asset. Investing in the digital asset is indeed an investment. The protocol moves it around from person to person. This is similar to investing in domain names; a limited digital asset(key words like business.com) with the expectation that ownership of the asset will be more valuable in time.


I agree. They do need to stop saying that. I think the idea most try to communicate is that investing this asset will either give unfathomable returns or next to no return(possibly negative). But I could also see Bitcoin increasing in value by a steady % eventually. So I'm not sure if that accusation of Bitcoin's investment returns is reasonable.

Incorrect. Hashrate may be the strongest defense, but it is not the only defense.
Miners gave in to node pressure via UASF. While my opinion is that it was not an attack (since I believe the results of the UASF ), some people did see it as an attack, and hashrate had no footing as a defense at it.
Nodes also keep Bitcoin secure by being obscenely redundant. No matter how many nodes exist, there is the potential for all of them to be compromised. It's just a matter of how much it costs to attack every single one. At some point it becomes unaffordable (but not impossible)

He has enough money to be able to afford to hold these assets after non-volatile value has been established. If he pays $4k or $40k for a single Bitcoin, it really doesn't matter to him, much like how BTC believers today see buying BTC at $300 and $600 to be good buys.
Your friend will probably end up buying if BTC is seen as a solid investment, supported by reputable organizations like banks or governments.
You may see something in the tech, and you want to take a riskier investment early in the life of Bitcoin. Big risk, big reward for being first.
If Bitcoin were TRULY valuable today, analysts would see it. There are far too many people who are very talented and capable of figuring out the beauty behind this technology to miss it. We're still unsure if BTC is even needed in most countries. Don't get me wrong I'm glad we have it, as it will keep governments in check, but BTC might just end up being that currency that never explodes in value, but simply COULD explode in value as a consequence for any government greedy enough to try and devalue their currency through hyperinflation. And for that, we have accomplished the goal of making money safer for people, and you may not see any extreme growth in the value of BTC anytime soon, but you parking value into it does make the world a better place.

They sit there forever until someone can "sign" a transaction with those keys. Possibly in the future we will have encryption breaking methods that can claim those old coins.


Pretty much. Until someone can sign a transaction for them, they don't move.


Since Bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 units, lost coins just increase value of active available coins. We could also divide into smaller units if desired.


It would take not only a ton of electricity, but also an absurd amount of computing power and hardware to try to attack wallets. This is different than mining.

More sellers than buyers.
Did someone promise you the price would go up? If so I'd take it up with them, because they promised something they couldn't back up.
Or did you look at the chart, assume you can tell where the price is going, and invest based on that? If so, you need to learn that investing is NOT looking at a chart and making a guess. Professional investors spend decades mastering the art of investing, so you're at a disadvantage.
Or did you hop on Google and search "will Bitcoin go up in price" and believed whatever advertised news article came up first? Again, bad method for choosing your investment strategy.
No one knows what will happen to the price. Many of us do research, develop a good sense of what it is, what it does, how it works, public perception, and a bunch of other points of analysis. From there, we try to figure out a risk factor and invest accordingly. If I see Bitcoin as super risky, I'm not going to invest more than 3% of my portfolio because I don't want a lot of risk in my life savings. If I truly believe in it but still recognize that there is a risk, may do 10%. At zero knowledge, I might put in $100 for fun but I won't be surprised if the price drops. See? I'm making intelligent investments based on my knowledge.
So why did you buy Bitcoin?

What are your reasons for selling and buying?
Did you sell at $750 to lock in profits, or sell when you thought the value was going down?
Did you buy at $18.5k because you were afraid of missing out of a higher price?
It sounds like you are investing emotionally rather than logically. You need to pick a strategy and stick to it.
Here is my advice that you should follow so people don't make money off of your emotional reactions:
* set aside the amount of money you want to invest in Bitcoin/crypto/anything
* Make sure the money set aside is what you can afford to lose. Will you be okay if that money instead had to pay off a surprise emergency like a medical situation? If so, then proceed. If not, repeat back to the first step
* Take that amount of money and divide by 10
* choose a period of time to invest your money in 1/10 increments. Invest it regularly to dollar cost average your way into a position
* Choose scenarios when you will sell. Have a plan for an upper and lower limit and what you will do. If you bought at $10,000 per BTC, maybe you want to sell 1/3 of your holdings if Bitcoin goes to $20,000. Maybe you want to sell half if it drops to $8000. Figure out these rules and STICK TO THEM
* Stop reacting emotionally. The reason you are doing this is because your brain thinks it can figure things out and "fix" things by resolving the point of stress as quickly, and expensively as possible. MAKE A PLAN AND STICK TO IT.

And that's what caused the crash. Or at least part of it.

Once your phone easily buys stuff with this "magic internet money", people will want to have it on their phone, kind of like recharging a gift card, but the gift card works everywhere.
And if you don't spend it, the spending power goes up over time, so it will be quite interesting when people start realizing this and hoarding it. Businesses will probably charge less for Bitcoin knowing it will go up in value, and a happy medium will be discovered through a free market (hopefully).

I think it hit a "5 year consistency" scenario. I've been in the ecosystem since 2013. But in 2017 we started seeing Bitcoin millionaires do stuff with their money. Things also look very optimistic.
It takes a while for people to catch on and say "hmmmm, that stuff still works? Wow, maybe I should get in on it". And enough people made even more money from it.
Additionally, people who bought the coins with spare cash at the sub-$200 coin level are starting to see big returns, so that turbocharges the appeal.

[technical details](
Basically, TCP utilizes error checking, because when you load a website you need every bit of code to load for it to function and be processed. If you have an error, you have to wait until the transmission catches up.
With UDP, all the data is sent without error checking. The goal is to get the data in real time and get the best summary of it, which is why you sometimes get drops in quality via video streams or live broadcasting. There's no reason to have the system halt until it has caught up entirely to 100% perfect data transfer, especially if you lost one small packet of data that tells the screen how to modify a 3x3 pixel box as live videos are playing.

Theoretically, you could reverse engineer a signed transaction to make your own via quantum computing.
But this only could work theoretically if you sign a message for the same receiving address multiple times AND reuse the same address again and again.
Most wallets have already fixed this by generating a new receiving address and sending the remainder of money to themselves.
So I have receiving address A with 2 btc and send you 0.5 to your wallet, Z. My transaction says "move 0.5 BTC to Z and also move 1.5 remaining BTC to wallet B", where B is my generated receiving address from the same private key.

There's no "true" value. Value is determined by many exchanges.
Coinbase has a higher price because it is super convenient to buy from them, they offer higher security, and a few other features.
I'm curious as to who you are referring to when you speak of the "true" value, because I'm willing to bet it's another exchange.
This scenario is like asking the "true" value of gold... Because you can go to a jewelry shop and buy that much gold at a high price, or you can seek a "true" value.
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:12:37
I think that when gold rises in value, mining increases and more gold is introduced to the world. With crypto, if mining efforts increase, we get a slight surge in algorithmically-generated Bitcoin, followed by a slowing of minting. That's yet another thing that differentiates Bitcoin from gold.
Not knocking gold, either. It's great to have a small position in many things.

Tldr: use your trezor
When you send money to a recipient, you send the designated amount to their address. In order to secure the remainder of the Bitcoin you send it to your own receiving address. This prevents someone from using quantum computing to spend the remainder of the money in your wallet.
It's complicated, but vital as a protection against QC. 


You make one transaction with 2 spending outputs. One output to the recipient, one to yourself under a new receiving key.


I believe almost every up-to-date wallet uses this automatically. This is a protection set in place similar to how https is used in your web browser without you even seeing a difference (except a little green padlock). Can anyone else verify this?
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:16:57
If we soft fork so Bitcoin has 16 decimal places instead of 8, that could work for the foreseeable future.
You could also integrate a smaller coin to pay for change(think litecoin but significantly smaller). Your wallet could do atomic swaps to pay the correct amount via either crypto.
Lightning can do fractions of Satoshi, I think. This requires the decimals to be summed up to make a whole Satoshi before settling the layer though.

Yup, these are issues. There's no getting around that.
But these issues are pretty easy to solve inefficiently. It is the innovation that will be a challenge. But the first ones to figure out these situations will become extremely wealthy and respected among the communities.
Think back to the older dudes who worked on the internet. I met a few of them who helped build ARPANet and other innovations ontop of the early days of Internet. They're super cool, crazy respected, invited to conferences all around the world, give great talks, and really enjoy seeing the next generations build things. Most of them look at cryptocurrencies and say it reminds them of the early days: All the nerds are freaking out over the potential good it can do for the world, companies want to participate but don't have the know-how just yet, and solving these problems will be more rewarding than any salary, but you also make buttloads of money at the same time.

* Gets people introduced to using digital currencies, along with a familiarity with the rules
* Gets businesses ready for digital currency
* At some point, a country will be unable to resist the temptation of abusing their stronghold over the digital currency, either through fractional reserve banking, inflation (and hyperinflation), controlling the currency, etc. These behaviors will work a few times, but after a while there will be a demand to put that abuse on steroids, and crash the entire system. At this point, decentralized cryptocurrencies will have all the legitimate uses, but none of the risks.
* They will be hacked. LOL

They key thing to keep in mind is that there are two reasons you probably bought Bitcoin:
* To have Bitcoin. In which case panic-selling shouldn't be an issue. Your % of all possible BTC ownership doesn't go down when the price does.
* To sell it back for money. In which case you're going to need to accept that investments can tank. Additionally, to sell it back for fiat defeats one of the purposes of cryptocurrency, so you didn't even have faith in it if you plan to sell it for fiat again.

What's a better thing to do is write programs and systems that can utilize Bitcoin. Mastering Bitcoin is a great book to start with, and I think python is the language that many prefer.
Reading that book is a great start. Then read it 3 more times to truly get an idea of how this stuff works.

Yes. At some point there is a level of trust in others. In Bitcoin's case, we are working with trusting the devs, some large "celebrities" in the field like Andreas, and those that also code our wallets.

Sure. You bought them. Exchange A sees you spent $500 on some Bitcoin as your initial investment.


Exchange A may see this as "selling" your BTC. They report it to the IRS as such.


Sure. No harm here.


Exchange B receives your $5000 worth of Bitcoin. Once you sell it for cash, Exchange B reports to the IRS that you've come into possession of $5000 cash. You'll be taxed on $5000 net gain.
Had you kept it with Exchange A, you'd only be taxed on $4500 since Exchange A understood that you had to put $500 of your money into it initially.
It is actually advantageous that you keep it with one exchange (note: I am not advocating storing your Bitcoin in an exchange, but rather keeping your transactions strictly with them) since they recognize both your upfront money and profits accurately.
Long story short you're not scamming anyone but yourself by paying taxes a second time on your already-earned money.

Take an amount of money you'd be okay with wasting on lottery tickets in a year, and put that slowly into Bitcoin. Buy that much each year and see if things work. Avoid lottery tickets and try to find other areas in your life to cut expenses to fund this investment.

He clearly doesn't understand how the self-adjusting difficulty works. This is really disappointing for a professor.
He must be assuming that difficulty increases at a steady rate as opposed to how it truly works:
* Bitcoin aims to have a block mined every 10 minutes.
* The more work put into the mining ecosystem, the faster blocks are mined, statistically.
* Every 2 weeks, the difficulty of finding a block adjusts based on if the blocks for those 2 weeks were found faster or slower.
* If people stop putting energy into Bitcoin, the difficulty of finding a block will not increase.
* If it takes longer than 10 minutes to find a block, difficulty lowers to make finding blocks easier (and faster)
Feel free to give this professor my explanation. If he wants, I could send him an email and I could explain the system to his satisfaction, answering every question he has.

There are only 0.07 Bitcoin per person in the United States. That's $28 of wealth.

UASF shook things up quite a bit. That's a first start.
Also, once mining hardware starts to slow to a rate near Moore's Law, we will see a better spread of mining. Otherwise, keeping a massive mining warehouse becomes a threat when:
* Employees strike
* Power goes out
* Power company starts charging more because they think they deserve more money
* A warehouse is attacked or bombed(internal sabotage could be a thing)
* The warehouse operation is hacked
It's better to spread out mining into stuff like water heaters for showers, power companies dumping extra power into mining, solar panels putting extra power into it, etc.
Wait until it actually takes 2-3 years for a profitable ASIC improvement to be implemented. Then we will see competition and a better spread of the mining power.
When someone controls 51%, you're going to get many interested parties trying to take their cut of the money/power. Local government, larger government, anyone who provides a service to the mining operation, etc.
POW isn't a huge threat to me. And what happens if we change POW? ASICs will be created to efficiently mine this algorithm as well.

We ran nodes that would only accept mined blocks that enabled segwit. If you're a miner that doesn't enable segwit, that's fine... but these huge number of nodes won't accept your proposed "solved block". That gave you a disadvantage because it's a race against time. If you get beat by another miner who DOES enable segwit, they might steal your "solved block" and the reward that comes with it.
Miners are all competing to solve a block the quickest to earn the reward. If you want to avoid a disadvantage, enable segwit. The only miners who won't enable segwit would rather take on the disadvantage instead of complying.

That's a very dangerous system to adopt.
Do you only allow people to buy necessities with a credit card if they have a low credit score?
Nothing is stopping you from going to a bank with an 800+ credit score and asking for a loan to buy crypto.
Credit cards deal more in a micro-loaning ecosystem for daily purchases and whatnot. They can set the terms for their loan. They see some potential issues:
* People issuing a chargeback via credit card because their wild speculation didn't work as planned
* The risk of someone being able to buy a ton of crypto with credit card and then declaring bankruptcy or another similar loss, especially if the price tanks
Credit card companies LOVE when you use their card. They make money off of it. The only reason they would change the nature of cryptocurrency purchases via credit card would be if they saw a risk or flaw in that particular type of purchase.

The government would lose that battle because 4999 other cryptos are eagerly waiting for Bitcoin to crash. And every time they ban it, the dials will be tweaked to make itself legal again. Also, the rest of the world will embrace it heavily as a response to that banning.
The best choice as of right now is to allow it to innovate it, try to stop crime through some regulation (this also helps them understand it better), and hope that it turns into another space race, because that will help the economy and also your citizens to gain world-valuable skills again.

The whole point of a blockchain is that all weaknesses are eliminated by removing all points of control.
You can either participate in the system and strengthen it, or you can opt out. Those are the only two options. You cannot campaign to take the role of a leader because no matter how great you are as a leader, you answer to at least one authority organization, by law or even something as wild as blackmail.
Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies have this amazing system built into them. Government and corporation sponsored coins will appear, and at the first sign that someone important decides they don't like something, they'll make a phone call and try to get it changed in their favor, and the currency stops being fair at that point. 5 years from then, all of these little adjustments will become more and more common until it collapses the currency. At first it will seem harmless, then mostly harmless, then a 50/50 compromise, and by then the currency has lost all value. If you give an inch, they'll take a mile. The only way to stop this is to remove any power that individuals or groups may have.

Unregulated cryptos are going to hurt a lot of people financially because of this stuff. However, if you play it smart by choosing to invest in what you understand after excessive research, there is A LOT of wealth to be acquired.

For those of us who hodl and ignore these asshats, gains will be made. The people who sold Bitcoin because someone in finance told them to sell it (with hopes to scoop a bunch up) haven't done their research and definitely don't understand what Bitcoin is all about.
Not saying the price manipulation was acceptable by any means, but you need to think for yourself. Otherwise you get into the mess that is government currency.
This is like listening to the CEO of Ford motors when he says Tesla automobiles are never going to work. I'd rather do my own research thanks.

Many friends, coworkers and loose acquaintances. They always ask me if it crashed and I'm like "nope, up 12% since we spoke last" and clearly I'm in a scam that hasn't stolen my money just yet.
So I started doing something different. I started agreeing with them 100%. Of course Bitcoin is a scam and it's going to crash. It can never be a real currency. I kept agreeing with them until they ask if I sold it yet. My answer is a very simple "no". I won't explain why I'm keeping it, I keep saying I should sell it and make the profits from it, etc. They get even more frustrated and are looking forward to me selling it... (One dude asked me 3 times this month if I sold yet.) Not because they want me to cash out, but rather they cannot stand the fact that someone got in early and they were wrong. Every time the price goes up, I note how lucky I was for being too lazy to cash out.

@_date: 2017-10-21 15:40:54
I am strictly looking at this from a decentralized approach. Politics aside, I want two(three-ish) things for Bitcoin:
* Everyone can participate in verifying transactions (running a node)
* Bitcoin scales to meet the needs of participants
* (I wish everyone could mine, but I don't yet see any way we could decentralize mining for everyone)
Here's my most important conclusion from the video:
There are two orders of magnitude that challenge Bitcoin: user adoption(will eventually stop exponential growth... Key word eventually), and number of transactions happening over a set amount of time(let's say per second because that's a rate most people use to measure network capacity). These are two exponentially rising factors.
In terms of storage space, we can assume that is an exponential growth rate for this thought exercise. Let's be optimistic and assume we can do this indefinitely.
That is 2 exponential growths needing to be met vs only 1 exponential growth that tries to solve the issue at hand. 2 vs 1 cannot win in this situation. Increasing block size to any scale will NEVER solve the problems. It will hinder growth unless another solution is found. One solution is lightning.

What no one admits here is that the best investment you can put into Bitcoin is learning how the cryptocurrency works.
Even if you buy $100 from coinbase over 3 months, you get a free $10. With that free $10 you can use it to learn how Bitcoin works by buying something, donating to a charity, sending it among multiple wallets of yours, or even giving it to a friend to teach them how it works.
I've spent the last 3 years obsessing over how it works and investing. I had a pretty solid prediction of how specific news events impact the price and how to use this stuff securely. Made over $200 in coinbase referrals because I could actually explain the technology. I'm teaching a few local finance professionals about Bitcoin in exchange for a free lunch, and I'm sure I'll be able to charge for this remarkably soon.

To brute Force a private key, you'd need all of Earth desperately using every computer for trillions if years before they had a chance.
If you're excessively paranoid, buy 6 hardware wallets (both trezor and ledger) and split your Bitcoin among them. That's now 6 wallets to brute force now.
You also need to stay educated in the field as new security measures and tips are established.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:40:08
Yup. 21 BTC means you own 1/1,000,000 of all possible Bitcoin. Less than one million people on Earth can ever have more Bitcoin than you.

That's a really easy way to get poor quick. Just saying.
You can buy small fractions of Bitcoin if you like. If it grows in value, you can indeed sell it for profit. If your $50 grows into $500, you have to pay taxes on the $450 profit, FYI (assuming you're in the US).

Okay, so now that you've used Bitcoin and you still believe in it, invest your mind into the space. Learn everything there is to learn about it. Become an expert. Learn coding. Figure out to explain this to any 5 year old. Be up to date with new trends and features.
You don't have to use money to be wealthy in Bitcoin. There will be many jobs in the Bitcoin world, and they will pay extraordinarily well if you have sufficient skills.
Do it. Starting tonight. Commit 1 hour to learning about this every day for the rest of your life. I've been doing this for over 3 years now, and I've learned a lot.
If you're serious about Bitcoin, and I mean SERIOUS, get your ass into gear and master this field. Otherwise you're just making a pity post. 
Edit: now that we're rivals in the field, I hope to one day meet you in a competitive fashion. PM me for a starter package of resources.

Ya know what strategy has worked the best? Buying slowly over time. This is called Dollar Cost Averaging, and people should try it. 
If you don't have 5 or 6 hours of time every day to do excessive research and find out what causes the price of Bitcoin to rise or fall, you probably don't have a position to be day trading.
Set an amount of money you want to spend this year on Bitcoin. Divide that by 12 and buy that much on the 1st day of each month.
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:48:34
Slowly but surely the mentality among people is "I should own some of this stuff". I'd say we're at 0.5% of the population of rich countries actively trying to buy bitcoin. We've still got a way to go.
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:17:36
Yup! A buddy who had 10 BTC now has 11 after trading it out.
I sat on the more cautious side and held both. I also hold significantly less.
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:08:59
This. By using new addresses each time, you only make your wallet vulnerable after the money is spent, so most wallets will take what's left from the wallet you are spending from and send it to a brand new receiving address within your wallet.
I have 1 BTC in my wallet. If I owe you 0.1 BTC, here's what happens:
* 0.1 BTC goes to you
* 0.9 BTC goes to my new wallet receiving address
By doing this, you shelter the existence of the Bitcoin in your wallet via a sha256 (I believe?). Sha256 is not vulnerable to quantum computing, but elliptic curve is(we use this to develop a private key)

There are experts with PhD degrees in statistics who get burned... but clearly he must be the exception.
I'd ask him to demonstrate his skills with a simulation. If he can take $1000 in theoretical money and "play" with it in a simulation, that would be revealing of his skills.
Additionally, if you steadily bought Bitcoin once per month at the worst times possible, you'd be so far ahead right now. But that's boring and most people don't want to do that.
Finally, he thinks he can read charts? That's not how experts analyze stocks. They don't look at charts and develop conclusions. Your friend clearly doesn't understand investing aside from Hollywood portrayals...

There are now 3 types of annoying people in the crypto space:
* Ones that have no idea how the tech works and what it does, yet have very strong opinions and try to convince everyone of false information
* Ones that "could have bought in at 10 cents" who will NEVER let you forget that. They often do this to imply that they COULD have been richer than you
* Ones that sold their coins in a panic, most likely at a loss, that want to tell everyone that they had coins but sold them. Some will even lie and say they DID make money and sold at the top, yet have nothing to show from it

When are they doing this? At price peak? At the lowest? Randomly choosing a time to do it?
For some people who have a Bitcoin or more, that could be the difference of $700 around peak or $100 after the price drops.

Maybe. At some point this would have happened anyways.

Network effect helps boost trust. Bitcoin is open source, which is really cool, but there are so many open source projects without support. Once a currency has both a social trust and an open source trust, it is significantly more valuable than just social trust.
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:46:23
This is the key idea to understand.
Buying crypto is a lot like gambling. Some coins appear to be like betting on red/black in roulette. Others appear to be betting on 00.
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:38:20
Nope, no cap. But if there isn't a full block, it would be foolish for miners to NOT take the extra fees, as it is free money.
Since this is all public on the blockchain, anyone can inspect that miners are accepting lower fees, and people stop overpaying.
This happens until the block becomes full with transactions(because let's face it, if fees cost me $0.001, I'm going to send everyone I know $0.25 of Bitcoin so they can try it out). At that point, only the highest fees get taken in, and only high fee payers get their transactions fulfilled with priority.
Let this go back and forth 144 times per day (144 10-minute blocks in a day on average) and the "fair market" price is found.
@_date: 2019-04-20 15:22:26
Two people set up a pending transaction. The transaction doesn't execute but is signed and ready to go. At any time you can update the transaction to change the values.
So Adam and Bob set up a channel. Adam says he will pay 0 BTC to Bob and 1 BTC to himself. At any point, Adam can change the transaction details to now say 0.1 to Bob and 0.9 to himself. They can keep altering the payments cryptographically to safely promise the updates are the concluding transaction.
What's also cool is that these channels can "hop" across channels. So Bob opens a channel with Chris for a similar transfer. Adam can now pay Adam-&gt;Bob-&gt;Chris through hops.
Now expand this to a meganetwork of 1,000 participants. Money can smoothly flow from one person to another, and each "hop" can be done for fractions of a Satoshi.
When you're ready to take your money out, publish the pending transaction(s) and you're good to go.
This is a very rough illustration, more for concepts than factual information.

That's my tattoo if Bitcoin goes to $100,000
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:50:03
Couldn't you do the following:
* Send Bitcoin core coins to a new wallet, A.
* Wait 144 blocks(1 day)
* Spend the new forked Bitcoin to a new wallet(different from the above), B.
* Wait 144 blocks(1 day)
* Send the forked Bitcoin from wallet B to an exchange and sell it
Does this solve the problem? Wouldn't this grant you different private keys for each forked side? I'm still trying to wrap by head around replay attacks.
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:52:18
So 100 positions to 182?

No matter the price, you still have the same percentage of the cryptocurrency.
And the product hasn't changed.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:48:02
I can't agree. Remember, miners are not the ones who determine what Bitcoin is. If they do, they would be incentivized to bend all rules in their favor.
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:20:48
I don't think the value comes from failure of fiat systems, but rather that digital currencies done right better serve our needs in today's world.
The internet's success didn't come from the failure of printed press, but rather that it better suited the needs of a globalized world.
I understand that a lot of people like to hate on fiat currency, and in many ways it does not suit the needs of all. However, this community also gets uptight when immoral people play dirty with unregulated currencies.
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:54:09
No one here can know. The generally accepted prediction is that the price will keep rising, but maybe we'll see a drop in price since the growth has been so unnaturally fast.

$1,000,000 BTC means we have a market cap of $21 trillion.
That's about 3x the value of all gold. It's possible, but incredibly unlikely within the next 100 years.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:08:25
Certainly. I consider 1x to be Bitcoin. It really depends on what the majority of people thing. Cash, Gold, and 2x are technically Bitcoin, but the market right now is saying Core is the most valued chain of Bitcoin.
Interesting times we live in.
@_date: 2017-09-30 01:54:26
When a chain splits, the direction is taken in two directions during a block. As long as you had control over a Bitcoin private key before that chain splits, you have coins on both chains.
That's why holding onto it, until you figure out exactly what is going on, is the best course of action for beginners trying to speculate.

If you have none, you aren't participating financially. If you want to get into Bitcoin, take the amount of money you'd be happy with spending on lotto tickets over a year, and buy that much in Bitcoin. That way it's not something that will devastate you.
Additionally, learn by educating yourself. The best thing to do right now is to understand this stuff. There will be a huge job explosion if this kicks off. Learn how it works, pick up a bit of coding, figure out all the rules, stay informed of trends, etc.

It depends on what you're expecting.
Most of the time when someone asks us this, it's because they want a clear cut reliable answer of "the price is guaranteed to rise, buy it".
We have no friggin idea of what's going to happen dude. Very few of us are professional investors or traders, and most people here barely know how the tech works. Don't trust advice of people here. Now that you know that, here's my advice to you:
Now, if you look at Bitcoin from an investing standpoint, we have some truly special tech emerging. This system is surely going to gain momentum and holy crap are you actually trusting my advice after I literally told you to not trust us? Seriously dude, we can't help you make safe bets. Do not trust advice in any message forum.
Learn about this on your own and put in the time to understand what you're about to invest in. Investors don't make money by asking in a message forum how to invest their money. They research and learn about it.
If you are afraid of missing the boat, cut out a bad habit in your life like coffee or cigarettes or impulse shopping, and apply half of the savings into investing in Bitcoin AFTER getting your regular financials in control. Contribute to retirement accounts, learn some basic investing with the stock market, and maybe put 10% towards bitcoin. That way you're channeling a negative habit into a neutral habit as a worst case scenario. In the meantime, learn more about how this stuff works and you'll be able to make better investments with your money.
The best investment you can make is with your mind. If this kicks off, there will be an incredible demand for experts in the blockchain/cryptocurrency field. I'd say it is completely reasonable to expect a 6 figure salary being a competent expert in the field. [Here's]( a resource to get you started. I trust you will cross reference my work with the work of others, or else you're not following my advice yet again.
It's a lot of work, and that sucks, but you can do it if you're serious about profiting from this.

Learning blockchain is a nice way for bankers and CEOs to learn the Bitcoin ecosystem while leaving the bill for the company to pick up.
It's like a CEO for a horse travel company learning how to drive a car because "steering wheels are the future of horse-powered transportation. These automobiles are just a fad and a scam."

I'm a millennial who likes the stock market in addition to crypto. I think a lot of people dismiss the stock market because they don't want to put in the time to learn about it, and I also think the average millennial dislikes that they can actually lose in the stock market.
Not trying to stereotype millennials, but I think the following are true:
* Risk averse
* Hate being "locked" into something like owning a house or a major investment
* Would rather find the meta-answer of what to do instead of discovering it themselves
* Doesn't trust larger systems
* Always paranoid of being scammed
These accusations come from self-reflection. I have most of these negative traits and I'm working on them, and I've seen it across my generation.

@_date: 2017-10-16 11:55:04
This is exactly how it should be done.
In addition, you should test your backup. I sent $2 to my trezor(this is from a while ago btw so $2 might not be enough). Then I reset the device and restored it from my seed. Then tried sending $10. Then sent the majority of my holdings.

The really cool thing about this is people can turn money into Bitcoin and then use it to buy digital goods like video games.
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:43:52
Not within the next decade.
I think we'll see $10k in early 2018, $50k by 2020, and a stabilization towards $100k in 2025. From there it will take an absurd amount of time to double at that point, like another 25 years.

Yes, I recommend doing so.
Bitcoin has the highest market share of crypto. Probably a good idea to start there to balance your risk in the field.

So then you'd hire someone to brute force your private key.
However, you say it was stolen and now you say it is just missing characters... Which is it?
If someone stole your money your private keys won't have any funds attached to them because a scammer moved them to his or her own wallet with private keys you don't know.
If you lost your private keys, that's a different story.

Money is a medium of exchange that has certain properties:
* scarcity - Isn't easy to replicate, or is hard to find. Examples include: Laws protecting the copying of the USD, gold, seashells being traded in civilizations far away from the shore
* unit of account - Can be easily counted to help communicate value. Your goat is worth 42 sea shells. My chicken is worth 10 sea shells. Haircuts costs 1 sea shell. We can use sea shells to summarize value across the board of services/goods.
There are other properties, but they are pretty straightforward. These two above qualities would do best to describe money-like characteristics.
Last week I drove a friend to the train station 30 min out. He wanted to chip in for my gas and toll expenses. He sent me $15 in Bitcoin.
Last month I bought something via Craigslist and we used Bitcoin.
It's money. It does the job of transferring wealth. If you want to argue that no one is using it in the area, I would counter-argue that I probably wouldn't have much luck spending Euros in the USA either... but we consider the Euro to be money.

Hide your keys from your son. Do not create a situation where he could give those keys to friends via peer pressure. Kids at a young age are very easily convinced by older peers that they are doing nothing wrong.
Educate your son on this, and maybe consider splitting your wallet among multiple keys. I personally have 2 Trezor devices and one Ledger. Looking at a 4th. Each member of my family has a copy of specific keys (or partial sets of keys where they need to unite to unlock the cryptocurrency). This is so no single hiccup can clean me out.
Good luck, and I'm glad your son is learning!

That's a little more than 1/4 of the market cap of Bitcoin BTW.
@_date: 2018-07-16 11:17:14


Stocks often generate income. They slowly gather more and more value if they do a good job. If money changes to crypto, these companies will be obtaining crypto.


But it doesn't generate profits like a business. That's a little scary to seasoned investors, who are professionals at finding value.


Sure, but it doesn't have all the features of cash just yet.


Yeah, some people call the stock market a scam. Inexperienced people are gonna toss accusations around.


Maybe eventually.
@_date: 2017-09-01 02:45:07
Estcoins? Nahhh they should gather Bitcoin! The first nation that does this is going to be the next oil country.
Imagine if they bought 1 million coins? They'd kickstart the greatest demand for Bitcoin and become insanely wealthy.
And this also goes for some legal department that confiscates something like 25,000 Bitcoin and holds onto it as speculation for a retirement fund/pension for their workers.
These would ignite the currency. First one to start doing this wins. Why hasn't anyone done it yet? It's like a loose cannon ready to go off.

I'm open to any questions as long as you first do the job of googling it.
I like to add discussion to further clarification
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:48:20
First person there gets the most business, reputation, and opportunity to lead the way. If your company always innovates and keeps pushing the envelope, people will want to work for you. You get passionate people, you get the best workers.
No one will be able to reasonably compete if you're leading the way at every step. Think Google back in the early 2000s. They rode the internet to becoming the 2nd biggest company in the world, in a matter of 3 decades.
I assume an entire nation could accelerate this process, making their people the leaders in digital space, finance, security, and innovation. They will highly impact the economy and be a superpower just because everyone turns to them for guidance on what to do next.
I know it sounds crazy, but this is probably not far from the truth.

Dude, it's a bad idea to put everything into Bitcoin. If it fails, tanks in price, or becomes illegal in your country, you'll have nothing to account for at the end.

And maybe you want to invest slowly? Perhaps something like $40 monthly would help you slowly understand it a bit more. That way, you have some skin in the game, but you can stop or even invest more as you become more confident.

Bitcoin is a new "thing". New things are difficult to analyze and determine a true value. That's where volatility comes from.

Echoing this idea. Segwit was a no brainer. The biggest value is that if we double block size, we don't get double transaction capacity; we get an order of magnitude larger number of transactions.

Here is how I interpret the quote:
Bitcoin's security and policy is determined by mathematics. You can't make up mathematics, you can't change the laws of numbers, and you certainly can't change the amount of available Bitcoin.
Comparing this to a government's money system, 4 election cycles can do some pretty big damage to the monetary system. Sure, the government of any country is supporting money now, but get a few bad actors in with questionable motives, and the entire monetary system can be thrown out of whack.
Bitcoin changes that by making it math-based instead of policy-based. You can change a policy over time, but you can't change the fundamental mathematics of Bitcoin.

Millennials understand the idea of the "copycat approach" for other crypto trying to be "like Bitcoin but better" and they don't trust it. Yes, many cryptos do different things, but as of right now money is the major item of concern. Millennials are struggling to earn money and maintain the value associated with it. They understand inflation, how money is abused by governments, how countries collapse because their government isn't responsible, and how scarcity plays a vital role in value(collector's edition, video games with rarity established, trading card games, mathematics between supply and demand, etc.)
It also doesn't have a founding organization that can turn on them (much like many companies that start out offering a "free" service and have ulterior motive, or the ones that start as too good to be true, then turn on the monetization dynamic once the service becomes of value to society).
Bitcoin is just "free" in the terms that the rules won't change violently, no new CEO can come in and restructure, no one is there to extract a profit from them, and promises can't really be broken.
No surprise that millennials prefer Bitcoin. We have bullshit detectors that can detect a lie from a thousand miles away.
And I cannot think of a better demographic to adopt Bitcoin as a serious tool for exchanging value.

Let's say I could "buy" $1,000,000 with Bitcoin. Using the 4% rule, I could instead drop to 3% withdrawal indefinitely and gain an extra $30,000 annually to fund vacations, travel, adventures, and supplemental income so my salary can almost entirely go to living expenses and funding retirement accounts.
I know it sounds weird, but if I ever had $2m of Bitcoin, I'd sell half for this lifetime membership.

Yeah, initially people get involved with it. Then we have small drops in price and people freak out.
You need to constantly be learning about cryptocurrencies to be able to stomach these types of drops and still hodl. Many friends bought and panic-sold when we had a drop. Sucks for them, but they aren't trying to learn about the technology. You start learning about it and you realize how much potential this thing has, and every time you learn something new your mind is blown at the genius of a small feature, and you know that in the longrun this is going to be really really big.

Just finishing my coffee so this will be a good toilet read.
This is why I'm optimistic for Bitcoin. It's not the technology in the current condition but rather the upgrades that have yet to come. Since bitcoin's system is outwardly facing and "innovation can be done on the edge" (Andreas' words), it puts the same creativity as the internet in the hands of everyone.
Just wait until we get teenagers being able to program their own features and innovation in a way that money is changed forever. Some 15 year old kid is going to invent something purely from curiosity and stubbornness and change the world in a very weird way.
The price may be falling right now, but hodl your Bitcoin. If you're in it for the money you're doing it wrong.

They are being made, every 10 minutes. Every 4 or so years the supply gets cut in half, as others have explained.
This was built into the code because Satoshi did not like how governments could print more and more money to pay their bills. Problem is, the more money you print, the less it is worth, resulting in the money you save being worth less, which is why the costs of things have gone up in price.
So Bitcoin solves that. Being hard capped at 21 million coins means we can predict the steady rate of inflation, or we can simply assume 21 million.
Having just one Bitcoin makes it so only 20,999,998 people in the world can ever have as much as you do. The percentage of all possible Bitcoin you own will never change.
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:06:53


Okay, so it is worth noting that some people can cancel the contract. This is to be expected for illegal and immoral systems. That is an appropriate and honest answer that I can appreciate.


There are many solutions. Perhaps you should look into using a form of decentralized file storage to guarantee the actual contract. Sia or storj are examples to consider. They could store simple text files outlining the contract, code, parties involved, reference number, etc.
That way, you could write the contract, point to the contract backup via a decentralized system, and ensure that all parties can verify in a way that has decentralized characteristics.

Banks/governments cannot resist the temptation to "fix" their debts by introducing more money.
It works a bunch of times. But once it becomes the norm, we obsess over using it to accomplish everything. And once one nation uses it to turbocharge their economy, other nations must do the same to compete(or at the very least just to keep their head above water).

Whenever someone acts as if Bitcoin can't be money, I always say there are good controlled currencies and bad controlled currencies. Bitcoin tends to sit in a zone that doesn't embrace much control aside from consensus. It's always gamed to have a neutral stance for all participants.
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:08:45


Yeah, that was the mentality until some people realized if the government controlled the money, removed any attached value (such as gold), and printed as much money as they needed to pay their bills, it made the money much less valuable.
So now we have a cryptocurrency that can fill the need of being digitally scarce and able to perform in today's economy without much friction. The openness of it is what makes it so special.

I dislike most altcoins as a speculative investment for this sole reason: if another altcoin can outperform Bitcoin, that means another coin beyond that one will most likely outperform THAT coin.

@_date: 2019-09-13 18:10:27
The concept exists, yes. But the same could be said about gold. Rare metal that is mostly held onto for speculative purposes.
But the utility that Bitcoin provides is the openness of how the rules work. Bitcoin holds a pretty darn neutral approach to storage of value, and has hard calculated limits in how much can be produced. It can also evade censorship in many cases, and feels decently immune to government controls.
That stability is something quite valuable in a society that is slowly shifting everything to a digital medium, including their own money.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:23:51
The simplest, truest answer is that there are more Bitcoins trying to be bought than sold.
Other reasons:
* Segwit2x concerns are disappearing, especially considering this is our second fork. We can kinda predict what will happen.
* Bitcoin has constantly been growing in terms of user base. Most of my peers have shifted their opinions from "I don't want to buy such a risky investment" to "I should probably just buy a little"
* People who have made money from Bitcoin are still buying some, even at this high of a price
* Public knowledge is increasing
* It seems that Wall Street and other financial experts are on the fence and disagreeing on how Bitcoin is going to play out
* We are seeing more and more that government controlled money isn't necessarily better than cryptocurrency in terms of experienced benefits of the majority of the world
* Increased segwit support and adoption
@_date: 2019-09-07 22:18:47

So many people, including me, are looking at the chart, having an egotistical moment where we say "Hmmmm, yeah that's a line and it's going up. So that must mean Bitcoin will follow this pattern."
The only thing this does is explain to us the history leading up to today. This doesn't tell the future and if it gives the impression of "that crash didn't look so bad", you're making compromises again and again to convince yourself you couldn't possibly have bought in at a bad time.
I'm still bullish on Bitcoin, but we gotta stop hiding the truth to shelter our egos. We had a 60% drop in price. Lots of people lost money. This is a truth. Remember to only invest what you can afford to lose, and accept that you might lose. You'll have a lot more peace if you can do this.

I think portability wins in this case. It can go wherever mentally, digitally, physically. Bitcoin wins this one.




I'd say it's about on part of anyone who loses their cash wallet. At least you can recover your Bitcoin if you take proper measures. Bitcoin wins again.




Not exactly. You can't decide gold into atoms without special tools. Also, can you produce exactly 3.44684335 grams for me? Rather difficult, wouldn't you say? Bitcoin and cash win over gold.




Cash is more fungible because of how hard it is to track. Bitcoin loses is this category for now. Bitcoin loses in this category currently.


Cash also can't be confiscated if you bury it somewhere. And yeah, Bitcoin can't be confiscated if it is secured in a way that is meant to stop confiscation. I'd say maybe a tie here?




That's IF you can get it from one person to another. If all of a sudden I'm not allowed in Canada, it would be rather difficult to transfer the goods. Expect borders to search for such items.
With Bitcoin, I can use stenography to hide transaction details in a photo and send it via the Internet. Bitcoin slightly wins here.

I would not say it is too late, but we need to acknowledge a few things before I recommend buying into Bitcoin.
1. How are you doing financially? Can you cover bills, expenses, and maybe some traditional investing? Things like the stock market, bonds, etc. are important to have. With how crazy the Bitcoin price can be, it is wise to have some money allocated in traditional investments, especially those that have tax advantages.
2. Do you have an appetite for risk? You could invest $200 and it could turn to $100 overnight. It could also go to $300. It is seen as a very risky asset. If you are okay with this, keep going down this list.
3. Do you understand the technology? Can you explain how Bitcoin works? Can you confidently store your own private keys with redundancy? Do you feel comfortable getting your coins off of an exchange? Have you played around with a hardware or software wallet before? Does any of this confuse you? If so, you gotta make sure you understand these things. Here's [my site]( if you want to start learning more about it.
4. Do you understand Bitcoin's perceived place in society and the world? If your plan is to sell it back for a currency like US Dollars or Euros or whatever, you may be missing the forest for the trees. It would be helpful to know WHY Bitcoin went up in value so quickly.
Hopefully this shed some light on the situation. Always open to questions, either here or through PM. Good luck!

True, but it was decentralized. People can do what they want with Bitcoin because there are no rules on how it is used. If organizations want to make an ETF, let them. It still doesn't change the key facts:
* 21 million coin cap
* anyone can tap into the network
* users can own their private keys and their Bitcoin
Who is to say you, or anyone else has an authority, to say that this wasn't the intention of the crypto? The whole point is that no one can say or do anything to start selectively enforce rules.

If Bitcoin keeps growing their user base, it is entirely possible. As of right now, Bitcoin matches a year's allowance of a Roth IRA contribution, which many people already cannot afford (or, rather neglect to fund).
Remember people, diversify. Bitcoin is amazing to have, but you shouldn't neglect your 401k or Roth IRA.

Cyber Security General Tip:
If a service, site, app, or anything else wants you to verify your identity or anything like it, access the app/site/service directly. Do not do the shortcut through the email.
In a way, this adopts a similar practice to "air gapping" a system. You isolate the "connection" between that email and the service. Email is best left as an "informative" service as opposed to "informative plus connecting". If the information is trying to deceive you, the connection service will also be malicious.
Interlinking email directly to a service or app is an easy way to get scammed.

I always approached people by saying to only put $100 into it for a wild lottery ticket: Who knows, could buy you a car someday.
People liked that, and when the price tanked I took them out to lunch one day. Their $100 went to $40, but they aren't devastated, especially after lunch.
If it goes back up, like way up, they're buying me lunch

During the California Gold Rush, the people who consistently got rich were the ones that:
* Sold mining equipment
* Sold transportation services for gold
* Made the markets between buyers and sellers
* Sold security

Yes, gold ended up being super valuable, but that was a slim chance of actually hitting it big.

Let them make a Blockchain. Then let them force a profit model into it. Then let them reverse a few transactions due to political pressure. Why would a company try to develop this if they didn't see a way to profit from it?
By then, people will understand and accept Blockchain tech, and they'll turn to Bitcoin.
Edit: Thinking about this more, we have a similar model to "internet" with companies trying to offer their own restricted versions of the internet like AOL. They might work initially, until the needs of cryptocurrency exceed the rate of development companies deem as profitable. This is where we need to carefully follow the law, as once a business is threatened by innovation, they try to change the law to accommodate their needs instead of the needs of the public.

There will be copycats.

And there will be idiots who don't Google the difference between the two. And they'll learn over time that they didn't invest in the thing they wanted to because they were dumb about it.
When people ask me if they should invest in Bitcoin and/or cryptocurrencies, I ask them 5 or 6 reasonable questions to see how much they actually understand about it.

There's a reason why ATM machines wait until you've committed to putting in your card, entering your PIN, and selecting how much money you want. This is to commit as many people as possible to the idea that their problem has been solved... but wait, you just have to pay this teensy tiny fee if you want the complete the last step before getting your money.
So we have people trying to buy Bitcoin for their first time. Bam! They're getting their Bitcoins.
This is unfortunately a business model. Might be worth talking to the owner of the business and ask them to display data about the fees so people don't perceive the store in a negative light.

I'm not sure why people hate banks. They do great things in some ways. I think having both systems will keep each other in check.


Yup, this is why I'm not against them. However, there are some systems put in place that make them less than ideal.


Sufficiently backed up passphrases solves this, as you can install a new wallet, free of charge.


Code isn't law because we don't need to all agree that said laws will be followed (or givne consequence for not following). Code (at least open source) means that I can read how the system works and I can decide if I want to play by these rules.

That's a significant amount, but at the same time not really.
There are 144 blocks per day on average. 12.5 BTC per block means 1800 BTC are created daily right now. That's $14,400,000 worth of BTC being introduced to the world daily. A $100,000,000 dump is less than a week's worth of what happens via inflation. Again, while significant, it is still not a devastating dump.

What's funny is how people perceive you every time. I've dabbled in getting companies set up with websites, built a social platform, and a few other fun tech goodies such as cloud backup, redundant storage solutions, etc. These were all done before they became super popular, and I was a complete noob in the field.
What happens is people say "Why would I ever want to do that?", but now these things are almost necessary for a business to survive. Website, social media (in some cases), and other forms of tech kind of "clicked" once they were embraced.
I've told people that crypto is super interesting and worth learning about, but they won't embrace it until everyone else is and it becomes popular. Can't tell you how many people avoided buying at $200 when I was telling them to buy one coin and sit on it for years, and now I occasionally have people asking me if they can buy "some of those cheap bitcoins".

So, as spam attacks increase and fees go up, so does the incentive for a lightning node to run, as fees inside of that will go up as well. Basically, the more expensive a layer 1 transaction is, the more expensive lightning hops will be.
As the incentive to run a lightning node goes up, we will see more lightning nodes, therefore, more connections and more efficient pathways to get to a destination, so less hops and less fees.
Spam attacks are gonna have to get really really extensive and expensive since the network will find more efficient ways to condense transactions.

The further one strays from knowledge about a tool they are using, the more vulnerable they are to manipulation.
* If you don't know enough about internet speeds, you're gonna get charged for premium internet when you really only use it for Facebook and email.
* If you know nothing about your car, you might have your headlight fluid replaced at a hefty fee.
* If you know little about money, you go through your life assuming there is a magic vault that the government owns where your dollars are backed by gold, and you can exchange it any time you like.
People don't need to know the details of mining, nor do they need to understand the mechanics behind singing a transaction. But they do need to understand the basics of Bitcoin to embrace it, such as not sharing a word seed, not sending money to strange sources, running a secure device, etc.
It's very much like internet. Most of us don't understand how TCP/IP works, but many do know the basics of computer security. If they don't, they learn lessons the hard way. If they do, they use the tool just fine.

I think you should take a percentage equal to your understanding of Bitcoin, and invest that for now. It might be $200, it might be $5000. Invest what you are willing to lose, and more importantly, invest diversely among other areas to limit your risk of single-point exposure.
We all wanna do wild bets and put it all into Bitcoin/crypto, but that's not responsible.
@_date: 2018-07-03 14:27:23
Right, but gold bugs who pay to store their gold in a vault also do a similar system.
It's going to exist. It's going to be a service that you can elect authority to, or you can do it yourself. Once one of these services decides to hold the BTC via fractional-reserve, lots of people will move their BTC out, or learn a VERY harsh lesson. Remember, you can't bail these institutions out by making more of it. That 21mm supply cap makes it so there are no quick fixes. There will be accountability.

At some point you could implement a system where users pay a fraction of a cent to post a comment. Then, if the comment is deemed by the community that it is positive (upvotes), 50% of the profits are given back to the top 10% of commenters by an automated script. Obviously we can adjust the dials for payouts and whatnot.


This is a big piece. Steem had a great idea going, where anyone could post on a platform and earn money. It also helps us better build a "free market" of online discussion.
Also, microtipping could be a neat way to use a social site like Reddit. I dabble in karma-whoring, and I wouldn't mind if it paid some side money.


After a while people will get tired of buying a "crappy product" and stop trusting certain sites. This happens in dollar stores quite often.


Maybe, but there's no stopping it at this point. Best to stay educated and involved in the field if you are interested in it.

If we look at it like gold, the tps rate is severely lower. Usually it takes 48 hours to exchange gold.
With bitcoin, I see it being pushed into lightning networks on a large scale while people operate under them (Visa and MasterCard would have their own lightning networks, as could BoA, Chase, etc.). That way we still have fast transactions at their fees, but we still use bitcoin as a major system.

You can set it up in any varying degrees, such as 2 of 5 for a casual spending wallet, or 4 of 5 for life savings, where you delegate this to 4 different companies that are kept regulated by a strict set of laws.

We have gold market caps as well, and they do not seem meaningless.

Bitcoin turned into a type of money that made government intervention obsolete. Like, for the first time since gold, a currency doesn't need the guarantee of a government for it to operate. The reason we give it value is because people see that other people are willing to exchange something of value to them just to have Bitcoin, and those people want Bitcoin because of the same reason.

So you get a lot of miners dropping out.
Okay, not everyone will drop out of this though. There is still money to be made, and if needed people will go back to hobbyist mining because Bitcoin is so damn valuable.
Then the difficulty drops, and Bitcoin becomes easier to mine. Some miners on free electricity will decide to get in on the action, because some money is better than no money. By then we may see people still mining for the small amounts of Bitcoin just because spending $20 worth of electricity gets you $40 in Bitcoin.
That's the beauty of Bitcoin. If people try to hurt the system, the system adapts. When every moving gear in the machine can scale in size, you have a remarkably resistant piece of machinery that can change to fit any scaling need (eventually), has no owner, and keeps everyone incentivized to play as fair as possible.
That is the beauty of Bitcoin. That is what will bring huge change. That is what makes it magic.

That's because you're not powerful and/or super rich.
Anyone well connected or rich could push their bank to prioritize the sending of money within 10 minutes. But if you're not a major player, you can't get exemplary service.
This is why the rich and powerful don't understand why this technology is so amazing. They're used to a comparable service already, so why would anyone want to embrace this technology? Heck, they probably have an agent to call to initiate all this crap instead of doing paperwork, risking account freezing for questionable behaviors, etc. They don't experience 3-5 business days, only after the teller wrote a sloppy 6 and someone thought it was an 8.
This system is a "catch up" tool to the rich, but will eventually surpass their archaic system because banks won't be able to compete with "streaming money", as it will be stupidly inexpensive, mostly because of factoring the costs of security into each transaction via the bank.
Bitcoin turned security on its head and gamified it. You get a steady trickle of money for enforcing the network. Bitcoin doesn't need to worry about security, but banks still do. Bitcoin the protocol doesn't care about profits, so banks can't compete with a system that doesn't have to answer to shareholders.

I could see some really cool things associated with microtipping.
I'm a huge fan of some YouTube channels that do magic the gathering based videos. In one channel, players play a big 4-player match where they have a free-for-all. I'd love to be able to tip players as they do an action in the video. One player knocks out another? I'd tip them 25 cents worth of bitcoin. Another player makes a ballsy move and changes the whole direction of the game? Tip 30 cents!
Another idea is to set up tip amounts that represent something. Maybe ask for tips by icon representations? Show a beer icon for a $5 tip. You could even match these to your show's theme. Science shows have a beaker, pair of safety goggles and a bunson burner to represent tip amounts.

This covers it.
I think browsing a "new" internet with micropayments will appeal to a lot of people. Buying $20 of bitcoin to watch videos for the year, ad-free will be appealing to many, especially when ads become more and more annoying, but less and less effective. The ad economy is starting to become over saturated at this point. Hell, even YouTube ads are getting annoying. I just grabbed YouTube red for removal of ads and access to play music. I'm loving it!
Give me a Reddit system where you can upvote by giving 0.0001(arbitrary number, didn't put any thought into it) btc and I'll gladly toss in a $50 budget for the year. I think this is where things are eventually going to go in society.

There's no guarantee. It's all speculation.
If you're truly interested, spend some time researching the white papers of each cryptocurrency that interests you. I've read the white papers of anything that hits the top 100 on coinmarketcap.com, if available.
In my opinion, the top 10 are a great place to start. I've obtained a comfortable position in cryptocurrency based on my understanding, risk tolerance, and investment in more traditional (and safe) things like index funds, bonds and other investments.
Do your research, no one will give you an answer on what to do with your money. If you want to get involved, take an amount of money you'd be fine with spending on lotto tickets every month, and put it into crypto. Good luck!

The biggest issue I understand is that government-issued currency can be produced. So you're playing a game for points, which are supposed to be scarce, but the government can add more points to the game whenever they need.
That means that my "points" get watered down more and more over time, so they're worth less as time goes on. I kinda don't want to hold onto my points because they lose value. I can either spend them on things or invest in an unstable market and hope my money grows.
Then there's bitcoin. There are only 21,000,000 points. They're not yet all released yet, but the supply production slows down over time. That means even when I make minimum wage, saving my points will hopefully ensure my savings increase in value, since more and more people will be born over time, and demand for points goes up! You can't make more points, and you can't really control these points either.

You may have missed the point.
Whether it is unethical, inaccurate, deceptive, or whatever... it doesn't matter. The point is to try the following:
* Stop for a second
* Hear all the facts and be unbiased
* Think about it for a bit
* Apply your knowledge and logic to it
* Then make a decision if you support it or not
I liked the idea of changeable block size until I sat down and thought about it for a while. I did some extra research and took time to think it through. When I can to my conclusion, I calmly decided that I did not support that side. I didn't try to tell and call people immature or unethical. I didn't start shitposting all over the place. I simply said "I see where you are going with this, and I do not support your path"... just like how people are deciding to exit the government controlled currency. No emotion, just a calm decision to choose another path.

Dollar cost average
Buy multiple times, spread out over a period of time. This will give you a very fair averaging investment, which will be easier on you if the price keep dropping.
I bought at $2600, but I also bought at 2100, 1800, 1600, 1200, 900, 850, 550, and 250.

This article got me thinking. The blockchain doesn't need dollars to be put into a ledger. It ELIMINATES the dollar(which was just a representation of debt anyways) from the equation. Now, bitcoin, the representation of the debt, exists INSIDE the ledger.

Bitcoin is real money. The money in your pocket loses value over time slowly due to inflation. I'm 30 now and when I was about 15, a hamburger at a restaurant would cost me about $7. Now, that exact same meal costs me $14. What happened where the same food ended up costing double the normal price? If all of money's spending power goes through this, it means that for every dollar you save today, it will only be worth 50 cents within 15 years.
In addition, Bitcoin is extremely young. It needs time for people to build systems ontop of it.
Don't look at Bitcoin as money today, but instead try to figure out what it will be able to do in the next decade or so. If you want a glimpse of how fast technology improves, try to fire up a video game console from 2000 and compare it to video games today. Now imagine that growth in capabilities applied to Bitcoin in the same amount of time.

When you get people whose success is entirely determined by a privilege or even working hard for something under the traditional business model (born into wealth, received a proper education, built a business successfully, right time right place,  etc.), you have a bunch of people who were taught that you need to take control over everything. By analyzing and changing every cog and policy you can to better fit your needs, success has been obtained. This is the old way of thinking.
Now take Bitcoin. It puts everyone on a level playing field in terms of access and opportunity. You don't need to attend a 4 year ivy league school to learn Bitcoin. Hell, we have people in third world countries working on 15 year old machines who are learning this system better than some devs. You no longer need a degree and $5,000 suit to be taken seriously, as long as your coding is good.
Bitcoin is stepping away from the norms established by big businesses. If you hide your secrets, meetings and code, you break the openness that attracts the best of the best and you're left with people who only want to benefit themselves as opposed to making something big. We've all seen where selfishness takes people. They eventually alienate their community to line their pockets. First it was the internet that disrupted a lot of systems. Now let's see what Bitcoin can do.
Those acting in the best interest of Bitcoin will support openness. I cannot take anyone else seriously at this point. No, I won't "just trust you" and no, I won't even support you if you keep one tiny thing a secret from me. Bitcoin is a network of TRUST. Bitcoin will not succeed if we start to keep secrets, because if one person gets away with it, it sets the norm for everyone else to follow suit. Be open and make it known that you care about the future of this system more than how much you can fill your pockets. You will still make a lot of money playing nice, and others will support you along the way.
Why do I trust my Trezor wallet? Well, I've been hobbyist mining with Slush for several years(Slush started the company that makes Trezor wallets). On top of that, they keep things open and constantly focus on doing a good job. I have no reason to distrust them because I CANNOT. They keep everything open and they aren't trying to actively change a young system to fit their needs.
Remember, Bitcoin isn't about the money, it's about the TRUST. For the first time ever, we have a system where we can trust with 100% certainty that it is truth. And this is just the start.

We can take the "paint my house" and build a smart contract.
Let's assume Bitcoin has grown and evolved so that you could prove you bought paint at a store.
I pay you $2000 in Bitcoin to paint my house. I don't give you the money, but I set up a programmable code that locks the code and does the following:
* The money gets locked for 30 days
* Allows you to point your Bitcoin purchase for paint at Home Depot to the contract. Supply costs are logically released directly to Home Depot upon your declaration of these costs. We programmed the contract so that only Home Depot's sky blue paint purchases can be bought with the funds.
* We set a expected date of completion. For every business day that the project is late, a certain amount of money is programmed to be removed from the $2000 we locked in Bitcoin. Maybe $50 per day? So if you bought $200 worth of paint we're at $1800. If you are 3 days late, you only get $1650 from the smart contract
* At the end of this, you take photos and I take photos of the entire project and bring in a 3rd party to analyze to see if the job was completed properly (with more complicated projects like building a home you would bring in the home inspector to "sign" a transaction approving the project fulfills all regulations)
* If the third party deems the project as satisfactory, all of the funds are released. Otherwise the third party agrees if the money is earned for a job well done
This is my take on smart contracts. In doing this, we ensure the "contract" between us has unchangeable rules that we both agree to upon programming this contract. We both enter knowing that an (hopefully) unbiased third party will operate fairly and we can understand and predict where the money goes at the end of this.

I saw the Canadian Congress testimony with Andreas, and one major thing worth noting is how open everyone was to learning about this stuff and their hesitancy to paralyze it with regulation.
Canada is going to enjoy some skyrocketed tourism when people can buy Bitcoin in their country and bring it to another country like Canada to use and spend it.
Many of us traveling folk like to keep a little bit of money for the next return, but what if you just kept it in crypto so it works in multiple countries? Factor that in with the price (hopefully) steadily rising, and your $500 investment at the beginning of the year turns into $650 by the time your trip happens. Of course, it could drop in value too, but I think if we see more adoption, we can expect steadily rising prices over time.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:14:22

Because they manufacture a new Asic miner, mine for 6 weeks like crazy, sell the "newest" miners to professional miners, and repeats the cycle.
Reduction in money earned from miners means less rewards, which means many people will drop out, which will lower difficulty, which will lower demand for bitmain's miners, which means less profits for them.
Hell, if the difficulty goes down far enough I might toss some mining rigs back on at 100gh/s to see what I can grab.

The great thing about capitalism is that it will eventually turn one bank against the others to become a cryptocurrency holder. This will in turn threaten other banks to join as well.
They can't escape it. Even if they hold out, shareholders will push hard for banks to screw each other over to break the alliance.
Hopefully by then we'll have more tech companies involved that value decentralization and human rights, and they'll be miles ahead of these companies that insist on maximizing profits instead of innovating and improving society.

Any form of technology will be used to capacity. Right now, it's kind of annoying with high fees.
But then Bitcoin won't get used much. The price to send a transaction will sort itself out in a free market as supply and demand fluctuate. If the need for cheaper fees happen, the market will encourage development of solutions like SegWit.
The system will build itself. We're all just impatient and want the easiest and fastest solution. Bitcoin won't work that way. It needs to find these solutions "the hard way". That is going to take longer than a client/server relationship.

Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency is not guaranteed to tick up in value over time. It will go up and down in value. However, a lot of people believe it will go way up in value over time.
Go watch some stocks trading on a weekday. Some days the price goes up, other days it goes down. If you zoom out far enough you see that many good stocks generally move upwards in the long-run.
You have no guarantee of your money going up in value. Only speculation.

This is also why Bitcoin exchanges make you verify identity. Otherwise it would be a very easy system for stealing identity, buying Bitcoin, and by the time the person fixes their identity situation the Bitcoin is long gone

They regulate it by making rules companies need to follow in order to remain companies.
They don't regulate Bitcoin, but they moreso regulate the way in which it is used in the country.
Take a gun for example, regulating a gun doesn't change how the science works. They don't pass laws that dictate combustion, or how dense lead is as a metal. Instead, they create laws that dictate HOW guns are used. You can't legally use a gun in a school, but you are allowed to keep guns for security use.

The price of Bitcoin is the middle point where buyers and sellers are at equilibrium. Just as much buying is happening as selling at that price. If the price goes up, it means more people are trying to buy than sell. If the price goes down it means more people are trying to sell than buy.

You can keep your paper wallets hidden in digital space, or you could buy a waterproof/natureproof safe and bury it in your back yard.
I have a folder on Dropbox that has thousands of pictures from friends and family, along with several that are simply "out of place". Each of those photos has a word photoshopped into it from my 24 word seed. Sequencing the words can be done in a way that only I know.
So if someone breaks into my Dropbox account and is able to figure out which of hundreds of folders I'm using, they would still have to identify the correct photos. I photoshopped misleading words into other pictures as well, so unless you really REALLY know me, you'll be trying a lot of different combos. In addition, the letters in the words are scrambled in a vigenere cipher.
As for my buried hidden safe, those words also are also shifted by a vigenere cipher.
You can build your own personal security, you just need to do some research and plan a good system.

That's a good point. They only exchange Bitcoin. At the end of this, they'll still only exchange Bitcoin, whichever retains the name.
They're planning for many scenarios right now.

Fair point. I'm sure you could only make it so that the third party is called in within the agreed upon timeframe. If it is not called upon by the last day, the contract is executed(or even wait until the $50 discount per late day is factored in, so 40 days total) 
And as for it being ideal, I'm sure you can find hundreds of examples where contractors screw over customers. But unfortunately those customers often pay in cash for a discount, so it gets tricky

You can buy 1 right now and it won't affect the price much.
You can buy 10 now and the same would happen
Buy 100 and you might see the price go up a hair
Buy 1000 and the price goes up a bit
Buy 10000 and you'll start moving the market
Buy 100000 and you'll move the market
Buy 1000000 and we see the price turbocharge.
Every time you buy, you have to get someone to agree to part with their Bitcoin for a price. The more you buy, the more expensive Bitcoin will get. You also won't ever find the ability to buy 1000000 Bitcoin at once, so you'd need to buy in parts. Between every purchase, you would see the price rise.
So you'd most likely run out of money before you got even 50% of the way there, and even if you get 50% of all coins, you still haven't encountered anything close to the prices you'd pay to buy the last 50%.
Also, I won't sell you mine, so you'll never get all of them.

If you think this is the last time Bitcoin will be attacked, you're not seeing what has made Bitcoin so powerful over the years. It is ALWAYS under attack. It will always have fights. It will always be gamed so people can try to control and govern it.
And every time, Bitcoin will prevail. And every time it prevails, it will improve immensely. This is another stepping stone along the way. We're going to have better times, and much worse times. Now that segwit is going to run, we're going to see one of the greatest ingestions ever get an upgrade that unleashes more potential.
And we haven't seen anything yet. Wait until the next explosive innovation to be applied to Bitcoin. Strap in, ladies and gentlemen.

I got a trezor for securing a large amount of bitcoin. I put my hodlings into 3 separate places. 60% trezor, 30% on my phone under mycelium with pin code to even open the app, 9% on a paper wallet, and 1% I left in coinbase just in case I wanted to very quickly and easily pull some cash.

No they won't.
They'll buy it at the peak of a 3x price run in 4 months, convinced that after seeing it rise and rise, they're "owed" more growth after missing out, then it will crash, and they'll refuse to buy again until the next 10x bull run.

People don't want to see a speculative 20% drop in Bitcoin at the split. They want to have constantly growing prices always and forever. They think they can stop the fork.
Let the fork happen. Money will leave weak hands once again, and those who actually value the currency will keep buying it. Hell, if you think regular Bitcoin is going to dominate, sell your BCC for BTC. Those who truly believe BCC is horrible and shouldn't exist should put their speculation where their mouth is and sell off BCC. But they won't because they're afraid. They have no faith in Bitcoin and every little blip terrifies them. After seeing this craziness going on since 2012, I've seen enough to realize this is going to interesting origin stories we will read in revitalized finance books in the year 2525.

"why would I buy something that went down in value?"
My friends who don't understand crypto at all are complaining when the price goes up because they were just about to buy in (they say that every single time), also noting "I just wish someone would have told me to buy into it when it was dirt cheap"... basically a cheat guide magically looking into the future for what the market would do down the road.
Then when it drops back down they refuse to buy it because it will probably go down more. 
So I just HODL my small amount and steadily buy more every month while they complain and complain. I can guarantee if Bitcoin goes off they'll be going off at me because they're too scared to take a risk.
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:53:25
Very possible. But at the same time, a proper setup with many multisig addresses and everything running through their own lightning nodes and top end security, it might work.
At some point, custodial banking companies will rise. It is inevitable. However, Bitcoin gives the option, so people can say "I see what the banks are doing, I opt out". That fact alone should hopefully keep them in check (or at least allow the technically savvy and smart to embrace it). Let's face it, people are dumb, they want someone to handle their stuff to minimize risk, and for some that's alright. Just don't make everyone do it. 
@_date: 2019-05-26 02:39:02
I think miners will be more accepting of these things. Most of the opposing forces to Segwit moved to BCH.

I always recommend tending to your traditional retirement accounts (a great goal is to max your Roth IRA) before touching crypto. Then, split half of whatever is left over into more index funds and crypto.
That's only if you are 100% sure you know what crypto is. Like, can you explain mining? Can you summarize Segwit and the Lightning Network? Can you operate a hardware wallet with effective backups? Have you set up your own node?
If you haven't done these, or at the very least can explain HOW to accomplish each of these tasks, you shouldn't be investing in Bitcoin, let alone crypto.
@_date: 2016-07-01 21:40:17
If we had enough nodes(millions), could we set up nodes in something like a RAID array? It would be very complex but it might be something that's possible.
Interested to hear discussion.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:38:50
If a daily item like coffee is sold on chain, I see one of the folding trade-offs being made:
* Massive blocksizes to hold tons of transactions, no matter how meaningless - consequence is that less can run full nodes since we might be adding gigabytes of data each day. Hey, you want all coffee sales stored in the blockchain... not just your coffee purchases.
* High fees - is it really that important that the record of your individual coffee be stored forever on the blockchain? Maybe so, but you're going to need to pay an appropriate fee, sometimes upwards of 150% the cost of your coffee.
Or could something like lightning be used to summarize all coffee sales for the day/week? One of our other trade-offs we will see with businesses is how frequently sales are archived. Every hour? Every day? Every week? Every month? Every year? More frequent sales will imply larger costs with a larger number of transaction fees.

1. You can't buy all bitcoin. Not all Bitcoin has been mined yet. To obtain ALL of it you must win every mining operation block
2. When IG launched? Not sure what that means. Again, you can't buy all bitcoin until all of it is mined in the year 2140
3. Buying "all of it" would also most likely tank the price in the early days if most of it went missing.
4. An alternative coin would grab dominance

There is no way a country will adopt a cryptocurrency at this stage in operations.
Think back to the days of early internet. Now imagine a country doing anything vital on top of the internet in the 80s. It would fail miserably.
Let's accept that crypto needs to creep in and slowly outpace all other monetary systems. Just like email, websites, online shopping, etc.

Maybe. I think $10,000 is that magic number that will change people's minds again.
People hate losing more than they like winning. I have a friend who bought in at the $15k mark(sold at like $6k) and gets triggered every time I talk about the price most likely breaking $20k this time around. He gets aggressive and uses emotional logic ("do you really think Bitcoin is going to recover after dropping 80%? Nothing ever recovers from that kind of crash. Bitcoin is dead! No one will ever use it! Sell like the rest of us did and cash out! Etc).

@_date: 2019-05-13 13:32:07


Didn't wanna come off as spammy, but [here](


Yup. This isn't investing. If you eliminate the risk you eliminate the potential reward (unless you are cheating and know insider secrets about a company).


Of course. People don't want to buy a losing asset. They want to buy in after several repeat behaviors happen and FOMO kicks in. A friend said at $17000 that he "was sick and tired of everyone else getting rich off Bitcoin and he should just put all his money in to catch up". I knew a crash was coming after that.


This time though, they've likely seen two "crashes" and a massive recovery afterwards, proving that buying and holding for a long time may be the optimal play.


Yup. That's a decently free market in my opinion. HODL on and let them keep dumping their money into the system. I have about 10% of my crypto ready to sell into the hype and will be buying back in if/when a crash happens.

@_date: 2019-05-31 18:05:06
I can see a few things as plausible:
* Lots of people bought in around $9k. They had alerts on Coinbase so they could sell to break even. It hit $9k on a normal bull run but sellers outpaced buyers, and caused a panic mode of "I need to sell this before it crashes further, screw it I'll take $8800 just to get out of this space"
* Manipulation that after a few bull runs upwards in price, whales figured they'd sell into the $9000 price, then do a massive dump to drop price, and then pick it back up when it drops even lower. Works wonders when you know the "crash" is caused by you.
* Bitcoin being Bitcoin, price sloshing all around the place
* A correction on the way upwards of $9k was inevitable. But then people bought into it when seeing a big crash after so many bull runs.

Here's what I have been thinking about recently:
I don't think the value will ever stabilize on a currency. We won't see Bitcoin sit at a value for a long period of time since population growth happens. Instead, we will eventually see a slow rise in the value of Bitcoin. Maybe it will rise in value about 3% per year, which would actually help a lot of people since you actually have an incentive to save your money. If you save 10% of your earnings, even at minimum wage, you would be able to retire after 30 years of work, easily.

Each one has different features and settings tweaked. Some have crazy cool applications built into them, while many are just clones of the original concept.

I removed everything in anticipation of these events. It also puts exchanges on a spotlight for handling withdrawals en masse, and lays down another reference for "if you don't control the private keys, you don't own the Bitcoin". These need to keep happening in small events so it doesn't build up to a massive crash yet again.

Every blockchain will fail miserably due to any of the following: 
* Lack of adoption
* Lack of security
* insistence on centralizing it
* Trying to compete as an exact clone of a successful decentralized blockchain
* Greed made from insider knowledge such as premining or overpriced specialized mining equipment for that protocol
That's what makes bitcoin unique and valuable. It came out as open-source and publicly before people could greedily pre-mine or develop specialized hardware. Everyone had a fair start as early adopters. In government-built systems, you can be sure they'll figure out ways to make themselves and all their friends filthy rich before the average Joe has a chance to participate.

* Mycelium - It's alright. I use it because I can set really low fees. That's about it.
* Breadwallet - Neat wallet. Looks nice. Operates well.
* Samourai Wallet - Has some more modern features like RBF and more privacy features. Looks decent. Works well.
* Eclair Mobile - Lightning-enabled wallet. Can sync to a node and set up payment channels on it. For a small fee you can set nodes with liquidity, so I can move around ~$100 of BTC as receiving or sending via Lightning for $1. Great way to learn how easy Lightning is to use.

Segwit is a restructuring of the Bitcoin block data. When transactions are gathered by miners and put into "blocks", they have a specific format for structuring the data. Segwit changes this structure and allows for more malleability by "segregating" parts of the transaction.


Yes. You need a wallet capable of participating in the Lightning Network. There are plenty of wallets that exist, but to truly run a lightning node you would need to run a regular node AND put a lightning node ontop of that. Plenty of guides online.


0.1 - $700. I would keep it on cold storage or an updated smartphone with private keys in cold storage.
1 - $7000. I would buy a hardware wallet. Trezor or Ledger Nano S.
10 - $70000. Holy crap. Ummm I would buy 2 hardware wallets and store half on each. Make backups of private keys. Memorize the phrases. Keep backups of phrases in a bank security vault (encrypted)

A friend personally lost 1000 of them himself, he's still not over that... So many people have lost coins. I'd say there's a good chance 400,000 are actually gone forever.

Fees will reach capacity and become ridiculous again. That's what happens with scalable technology.
Back in the 90's we were able to stream audio over internet, and it clogged up the internet quite a bit. Then, we fixed the problem with scaling improvements until video clogged the internet again. Then we scaled to meet demand, and now 4k video clogs the internet. We've fixed that, too.
The same will happen with Bitcoin. We will see the network getting clogged, then things will settle down and it will scale to meet the needs of what caused the clog. Then we will clog again and repeat this process many times. Thing is, developers have a hard time improving the system while the prices are rising, because all anyone cares about is the price. We made some tremendous improvements after the crash, and will continue to do so.

I remember when it hit $18k-ish, a friend finally said "I'm sick and tired of not getting rich as f*** like everyone else. I should just buy a ton of it because if I miss another huge spike in price I'm gonna be pissed"
I knew it was time to prepare for a crash.
This is the same friend who, even at the $200 price range, was told to buy just one, said it was guaranteed to be a scam because some names in Wall Street said it wasn't real money. Then, when the price went up, "I just wish someone would have told me it would go up in value. It isn't fair that a bunch of internet nerds had the first opportunity to buy it". He thinks everything should be done the same way it has always been done before, and gets mad when something breaks the mold. He doesn't know this, but I take notes every time he talks about Bitcoin, and his opinions are great for trying to predict the market. He's  been unknowingly pretty accurate at doing so. I just do the opposite of what he says. Literally, at $3200, he's taking the time to tell me the technology is dead and is going to zero. Just like that the price goes up.

With bitcoin, the value can only go up as demand increases. Banks used to do this to encourage us to save. Now, interest rates are a joke.
It may be a case where simply saving your money will outpace the average stock market growth. I find this a beautiful thing, because even if you work for minimum wage and manage to save 5% of their earnings, that money would grow incredibly fast in value.
The more I learn about bitcoin and finance, the more I see how bad this system is, and how fast society will adopt cryptocurrencies with no sole controller.

5 people each give 100 bitcoin to a bank to lend.
The bank has 500 bitcoin.
Only 500 bitcoin can be lent out for people to use, but the bank could "credit" the debt that the lender wants to pay (the bank now tells the construction company that they have an extra 25 bitcoin since the lending customer bought a service from them).
Banks could do it, but it would be easier to see the bullshit.

There are several formats for the phrase, so worst case you'd need to convert it to a new wordset.
These words are not exclusive and/or native ONLY to that wallet. The phrase is based on an open-source method, so you could build your own tools from scratch, or even translate it to the binary representation of your private key and move it to another wallet.
I actually have two separate wallets with the same private keys on them, just did that to see if I could, and it works perfectly fine.

Most things are Segwit, to my knowledge. Ledger Nano &amp; Trezor both support Segwit.


Both. You need to be part of a payment network where both parties are in the Lightning Network. Additionally, you would need to connect to a node and set up channels. This is not incredibly easy, to be honest.
I am Lightning-Ready in that I installed Eclair Wallet into my phone, connected to an ACINQ Node, and can now send money. I later set up another channel to an ACINQ Node and requested liquidity (small fee for doing so) to receive Lightning Payments. I've dabbled with it for a bit.
Currently, it would probably be cheaper to pay for something with a 1sat/byte fee, as that would amount to like $0.03 to transact. If they require Lightning, give it a try!
Note: You will probably spend $3-$5 setting up a Lightning Payment channel for both sending and receiving. Consider it a small fee to learn how it works.

No one should be using no-fee transactions.


It could be. It could take a very long time for the transaction to go through, and with no fee, why would a miner ever want to take that transaction and bundle it into a block? That's extra CPU cycles.
You should ALWAYS do at least 1 sat/byte, maybe a fraction of a satoshi if you know what you're doing. Miners need an incentive to include your transaction. When the mempool is empty, you can get away with spending a thousandth of a penny. When the mempool is blocked, you may have to spend a little bit more.

Here are some options:
* Could be on an exchange. Check emails and bank statements for any evidence
* Could be kept via private keys. Look for randomly written words in places like a safe or lockbox or bank safe box
* Could be kept on a hardware wallet. Any weird looking flashdrive-like objects could be holding the crypto. Do NOT try to brute force the combo, as it delays the time exponentially between guesses as you guess incorrectly
If you find anything, DO NOT share the words, keys, numbers, accounts, etc. Ask us for help blindly. We should be able to explain the step-by-step process without you sharing any information with us. You can say things like "I found a device that's called Ledger Nano S", but not something like "I found 24 words written on paper. The words are XXXXXXXXXXXXXX". Trust no one to "manage" it for you. Ask publicly, and ask others to chime in to support the answers you get.

The USD is the closest thing we can use to associate the true value of BTC.
So much economic activity is expressed in dollars. The USD is decently stable as well, so knowing the price in USD helps us figure out how BTC is doing in a global economy.

* A sandwich
* A 3 bedroom house in a specific town
* A haircut
* A riding lawnmower
* A pound of bananas

While you are correct in that blocks will happen less frequently and transaction space will decrease, we haven't seen the blocks become full anytime recently. Hell, my 3 sat/byte transactions go through just fine.
A 10% decrease in block space won't cause major issues, in my opinion. If the blocks are 20% full, they'll become 22% full. If blocks are 70% full, they will become 77% full.
I'm not overly concerned. I will make note of this, but I won't freak out like this post may be encouraging.

I think we're in the phase where it is very difficult to get everything set up. When my friends first got into Bitcoin, I gave them like 10 rules they needed to follow or else they would lose everything. It discouraged people.
Now, we set them up with a wallet, I take a copy of their private keys (letting them know I can also control their money on THIS wallet), and we play around with sending it back and forth and to a charity. They think it's a neat idea, and we go from there. I don't tell them the dangers or anything until they decide to buy their own. Then they get the warning: "You're now playing with your money instead of my money. You can lose this stuff easily. You need to figure out how to protect it. I'm here to help, but you need to ask the right questions."

You can summarize the basic behaviors, but when you try to analyze and calculate a plan, it rarely works. You could see a false peak, or sales could happen so rapidly that you could never time it effectively.

No investor on the fence is going to see this news and say "I NEED TO GET IN NOW!", let alone thousands of investors all deciding in unison.

And the credit card company charges a merchant fee. The store pays that. Just like gas, you can get a discount for paying in cash. As for the fraud protection, that's a nice perk that comes from the merchant fee. You could integrate a third party insurance agency that the merchant uses to assure consumers that their purchases are protected. I'm also not saying Bitcoin HAS to be used for day-to-day purchases, especially right now. In time, perks may surface through smart contracts. Credit cards are a result of a country that is built on loans and shuffling around theoretical debt. It works until it doesn't.


This is only because the store fronts the merchant fee. For a while, banks offered interest on accounts until everyone had a savings account. They now offer 0.1%, partially because everyone NEEDS a bank account, so why give up profits on something that is so integrated into society? Once credit cards become the absolutely-necessary method of purchase, we will probably see perks decline as Visa becomes more centralized and powerful.




Yes. Bitcoin is volatile. Maybe not the best time to use Bitcoin during the "wild speculation" period of time. As more adoption occurs, you can expect prices to stabilize.


Solutions are starting to arise. Back in the days of the early internet, people used to memorize IP addresses. One wrong number and you were brought to a different server. How did people fix this? They used DNS. A solution rose.
Using lightning, we could "stream" the money and wait for responses, just like TCP/IP. I can send you 1 Satoshi, wait for verification of receipt of it, then 100 Satoshi, wait for confirmation, then 10,000 Satoshi, wait for confirmation, etc. Until you receive all the owed amount. Given the cheapness of the lightning network, this could be done for probably $0.001.


In the near future, they might not. Until Visa censors certain businesses, or businesses can eliminate the ~3.5% merchant fee and use that service to offer better prices and innovate their service to better serve the customer.
You sound a lot like the guy who saw the internet coming and said "oh boy this 'internet' thing is never going to replace faxes. What is my incentive for starting up a computer, buying a connection, and learning to configure this thing? Why would I want to deal with pesky .com names when I can just use phone numbers and auto-dial?" Well, I'm now responding over the internet right now instead of a phone or fax conversation.
Additionally, micro-transactions are going to be huge. You could pay per second to stream premium video, or you could make micropayments to a site to read an article instead of being served advertisements. As Andreas Antonopolous said, this isn't "money of the internet", but rather "the internet of money".
To dismiss Bitcoin because it doesn't work today is just as foolish to dismiss the internet because in the 70s it took 6 hours for an email to go through, and was 50x more expensive than a fax machine.

I had a friend basically ask a question during the crash that changed my perspective:

Friend: "Well it sounds like it's on sale because people are impatient to see what it can do, before it's ready. I'm buying in now."

This is a classic example of overshifting the spectrum. Expensive taxi drivers are sloppy, rude, and don't care because you NEED them. Uber introduces newer drivers to the market at cheaper rates. Now taxis will need to compete by lowering costs and making it better of the customer. Once they steal back uber customers, uber will have to step up their game to provide better quality as well. It'll keep bouncing between sides until there is a healthy medium found.
You can't let either side get "spoiled" or else they become shit. They'll hopefully keep each other in check.

Buffet has a specific investment strategy. He buys things that provide value. He walked away from many things that had potential, because he plays it safe.
His commentary is probably to address the fact that people say "But Warren, you're supposed to be the BEST investor! You should have seen that payoff from a million miles away" even though it isn't in his strategy.
He speaks honestly. He sees no value in it. People here getting mad are ridiculous because one investor with a specific strategy doesn't see value in BTC, so they get mad.
Make your own investment decisions and see where life takes you. Don't think you'll be like Buffet simply by being like Buffet. If you follow in his path, you only strengthen his position by buying before the speculation.

And in providing a service exchange you boost economic growth.
Bitcoin is a system that encourages hoarding. If everyone hoards, economic activity slows, and bad things can happen.
We probably don't want Bitcoin replacing all fiat, but rather coexisting and keeping fiat in check. If fiat fails, that would be bad for the economy and society.
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:59:51
Who cares? Consider it an attack in BTC. A social attack generated by financial institutions. They pegged artificial value to something, and people bought into it. As a new currency, it is bound to happen. People have been tainting the perceived value of BTC since inception.
Bitcoin is permissionless. People WILL manipulate the price. People WILL try to build permissioned financial tools around Bitcoin.
That's the playing field. The important aspect is that once you buy x amount of BTC, you always own that share. The utility, perceived value, and acceptance will change, but the protocol won't (without consensus).
No one can make more BTC, but they can change how it's used. Let the futures people play their games. In the long run, you'll average out a return on your investment in terms of pure value, if BTC is as valuable as we perceive it to be.

Bitcoin is not the crypto to use on the dark web. Way too transparent.
Think of the internet. Most of us don't understand TCP/IP but still use it. Most of us don't care that the internet is decentralized either. But the internet still has value. The same will happen with crypto.
At this point I'd say 70% of crypto value is from people who understand it. One it moves closer to 100% we will see slow steady adoption.

And had you dollar-cost-averaged your investment over more than a 3 year period you probably wouldn't be complaining. This is a super early technology. I'm not saying out your entire savings into Bitcoin, but rather acquire a small amount, slowly over time.


Again, see my above response. It can be manipulated because the currency works as it is. No intervention. If people want to try and manipulate it, they certainly can. At small market caps, whales can splash around. If the market cap keeps going up in the long run, it will be much more difficult.
Gold could have operated the same way. Whales could have wildly manipulated the value. I believe that happened with silver a while back.


Of course. It would be stupid to put your entire retirement fund into Bitcoin. I'd say a 5% allocation is the MAX you should consider, and that's if you truly believe in the tech, understand it, and want to take on such a big risk. I would, however, recommend that nearly everyone take a 0.5% allocation in cryptocurrency, partially because of the points you outlined.
But hey, to each their own. I made my bets a while ago based on my understanding of the technology. I've been through several "crashes", and the product still hasn't changed. We shall see what happens.
Edit: it's actually spelled Bitcoin. Not Bitcorn. But hey I get that using that name will trigger emotional response instead of logic, so we can see what kind of self-narrative-filling responses you are actually trying to get here. You'd probably get better logical and technical explanations if you actually treat this like a mature conversation.
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:26:43
Entirely possible.
I think we're trying to define Bitcoin in terms of "old money". You won't be able to say "well if it consumes x% of this area, we can see it grow to this price"

Can't tell you how many of my friends, especially in high-end jobs with generous salaries, always "played by the books" when it came to career, finance, etc.
But when Bitcoin was $200 and I was pushing them to buy just one, they of course dismissed it.
Bitcoin goes to $1000, and I better "sell it all because it's gonna crash".
Bitcoin goes to $5000, and I "don't know what I'm talking about, Buffet would have bought it if it was valuable (see a previous post of mine that addresses this)" and lots of anger towards me for having unrealistic gains.
Bitcoin goes to $10000 and all of a sudden they need to know if it will be worth more in the future or not. I have no idea dude, but I made my bets and you should consider if you want to take the bet too. Of course I get a strict "no, I won't invest unless I know it's going up in value".
Bitcoin hits $15000 and now "I should just invest a shit ton of money into Bitcoin because I'm sick and tired of everyone else getting rich". I suggest they hold back and wait, but then it hits $17000 and they now think I cost them "a fortune", and they buy into it.
Bitcoin hits $19000 and they're ontop of the world. They finally started winning! They're the best investors ever and Bitcoin will rule the world! I was sooooooo wrong for having doubts at $15000.
Bitcoin tanks. They hated me for a few weeks, saying that I cost them their savings, even though the last few texts we shared was me telling them to NOT invest recklessly. I think their rationale was "how dare he make money and I not. I do everything by the book and he can't possibly come out ahead by deviating from what you should be doing".
Bitcoin TANKS hard to like $3600 and I get apologies from some, and others have not yet spoken to me. I imagine they all sold because they can't stand to lose... ever.
And now only after it goes up in value to like $7500 do they ask me if it's a good time to buy. I was hinting at buying it from $4000 to $5000 but in small bits and pieces to dollar cost average. Nope. They wanted to be the wolf of wall street.
tl;dr lots of people ONLY invest after seeing the price go up and up over time, after they think it will be a safe investment. People hate losing more than they love winning.

@_date: 2017-06-09 19:54:47
That's fair. You can keep your profits from it.
Basically, what I'm trying to say is if a person has $10,000 to invest, they should invest something like $8,000 into safe investments and $2,000 into Bitcoin if they feel 20% of their portfolio should go into something super risky. Only put $500 into it if you're trying to be cautious.
Now in your situation, let's say that your $2,000 jumps to $20,000. You still had your initial $8,000 invested wisely but it isn't a majority of your portfolio. Maybe consider selling $2,000 worth of Bitcoin at that point so you get the best of both worlds. You put "all $10,000" into safe investments and you keep $18,000 in Bitcoin profit.
You'll sleep much better at night knowing this.

Other reason:
* Coinbase went down while other exchanges worked just fine. Oops, no selling opportunity for you!
* US court orders an exchange to freeze itself and not do anything. You're stuck.
* Bitcoin skyrockets in value and now you withdraw, you're paying taxes at the time of withdrawal. I paid taxes upon withdrawal 2 days after buying it. My taxes are minimal from that withdrawal period and I've just been holding onto them for a while now.
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:17:47

And that makes it news worthy?
@_date: 2019-05-10 10:08:33
Not really.
I assume that since people have seen this type of crash now, they're going to either hold onto their BTC to ride the waves, or sell before parabolic growth (claim some profit instead of waiting for "all of it"), or buy in earlier.
This will hopefully smooth out growth. But maybe it won't. We have no idea.
This is why HODLing is probably the best strategy. Your % ownership of the coins never changes if you assume 21m coins.

I'm okay with spending half of my Bitcoin to "buy" a retirement in the US. About $2 million should give me a $50,000 per year safe withdrawal after interest and growth of super conservative investments.
And then I'd still have half in BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:54:01
When Bitcoin triples in value again, we're going to have a lot of people bitter about their purchase.
But they'll be back again. And they'll buy when the price has been rising crazily for like 3 days straight. Then it will correct again and they'll panic sell at another 15% loss.
@_date: 2018-12-22 14:39:12
See, I still look at the forked coins as "Bitcoin", because this was a feature of Bitcoin; the ability to fork and build your own rules in a free market. They have some of the properties of Bitcoin, and the OG hodlers have forked coins, which is the way I think it should play out.
The market is showing WHICH of the forked Bitcoin versions are valuable, and just how valuable they are, but those forked coins are still "Bitcoin" in my opinion.
I kinda see it like how TCP/IP makes up the majority of "Computer Networking". We still have other methods of networking, but TCP/IP is the most popularly used networking protocol.

Back in the days of ENIGMA, Britain let ships sink because they didn't want Germany to know they broke their encrypted communication model. If a government uses quantum computing to break a money system, they're announcing their most powerful tool for the small task of stopping the first wave money, instead of stopping nuclear war. If they use it to break BTC, quantum resistant cryptocurrency will surface as a response, because the government just revealed one of their biggest secrets to stop BTC, so they must be terrified of sound money. That would spark an even faster growth into the cryptocurrency universe.

Yeah. I just want these warnings to have a logical aspect behind it. If people want to overspend that's the consequences for not staying up to date.
This read like a very aggressive "how dare they waste OUR space" approach which needed to be addressed.
I agree that it's a non-efficient thing to do. However, I do respect companies that take hesitation for Segwit implementation. Being cautious is a reasonable approach. Once Segwit has years of constant use, companies will be more willing to embrace it.

I don't see the connection.
If mining power gets cut in half, you get half the blocks in the expected timeframe because it takes twice as long to find a block.
So transactions would pile up over time. Don't think transactions will just sit there though. If a person needs a transaction to happen faster, they raise the fee.
Some people will be priced out and say "fees are too high right now to justify this transaction", and won't increase the fee. Their transaction waits.
We might have an issue where fees go up. Only the most important (aka highest fee payers) will get through.
Overloading the mempool with transactions has nothing to do with the amount of time between blocks. The only thing that would change it would be if miners for some reason dropped out of mining because the fees were too high, but that's a rather silly reason to do so.
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:05:39
You're wrong. Artificial demand only makes it appear valuable instead of BEING valuable. Let it chart it's own course. We don't need people like you trying to force demand when, if it is a naturally valuable thing, it will take care of itself.

Every idea in Bitcoin will be challenged and analyzed with skepticism. Only the good ideas that actually promote positive growth for all will make it through that defense.
You could tell me that there's a way to cut block space in half with each transaction with no downside. I would call bullshit on that MANY times and until you can defend your claim against anything I question, it doesn't stand a chance at succeeding.

It is absolutely worth taking a ~1-5% allocation of your portfolio into Bitcoin, in my opinion.
That range really depends on how much you know. If you only know "Bitcoin is internet money and I always hear it keeps going up in value", then I'd steer clear of it. If you understand the basics and what it can and cannot do, then invest away!

Let me bring you back all the way to the days of binary mathematical computation. at first, it was very easy to add and multiply. but then came the problem of subtraction. How do you subtract from a binary number? it is very difficult to do in terms of circuitry. So, some very very smart people figured out a very complicated method to subtract, and that standard is integrated into everything that we do today.
all of these features just need to happen under the hood. It can be as complicated as we like, as long as it is reliable and people don't have to go through complicated actions to get this task done

So, not saying you did something illegal, but Coinbase DOES track where your coins go after they send them to you.
Could you have sent BTC to someone who may have done something suspicious? Gambling sites are a big no-no for Coinbase. They don't want to touch that stuff, so they police their users who immediately transfer the BTC to sites like that.

My goal is to profit though. Your price pump raises the price, but I'm going to sell into this increase in demand and rise in price. Then when the price settles back down I'll buy it back at a lower price.

If people were willing to pay money for it, then that's the market dictating the price.

We need bigger blocks eventually. However, segwit and lightning are the next logical choice. After, I am in full support for eventual bigger blocks.
Lightning efficiency increase: let's say 16x(it's not but use it as an example, it will be MUCH larger). Then, every 2x increase of block size opens another 16x efficiency.
Block size increase 2x size: just 2x capacity.
It's better to keep multiple parameters open as they develop, especially if they're optional. If that happens we can gain more efficient scaling with every tiny nudge of block size.
And I'm sure there will be another parameter opened up in time.

Do this for every book, ranging every word spread from 1 to 5000.

People also want to magically know the optimal time to sell BTC.
"Only gains, no risk" is a really stupid way to invest, mostly because you have no way to analyze how your investment is going to do. Everyone wanted to blindly invest and get rich, hoping they could tell their children "yeah, a buddy tipped me off about this Bitcoin thing and that's why we're on a yacht".
True investing requires some knowledge and acceptance that there is risk.
Want a less risky investment? Buy bonds. Just don't be all pissy when you don't get rich over a 3 month period.

So let me give you some theoreticals:
* Some sort of security bug prevails and impacts older versions of firmware. Not saying your coins can be taken (maybe they can?), but it could destroy the device or brick it.
* You go to update it and it erases the private keys from the device due to a "this is the only way we can implement this firmware update" scenario. Happened to me when I updated and I had to fish out my word seeds from the depths of my safe. Wasn't fun being in limbo where I could have lost my crypto. I knew i had backups, but at the same time I was only 99.9% sure. That's not a fun position to be in.
* Updating it keeps you well-practiced with the ecosystem so it isn't foreign when you finally do decide to run it

A few of my friends bought at 2800 and sold at 2600 because "I'm losing all my money!". They'll soon learn that patience will pay off, and they just want to sell it for a quick buck. Unfortunately they can't stomach that kind of price swings and they're now bitter about it. They're going to be real bitter when they see how much that Bitcoin will be worth in a few years.
So many people are entering the crypto investment field only to panic sell at the first dip. Thing is, they're treating it like Wall Street(their perceived fantasy) and expecting to make a fortune every day without actually knowing anything about Bitcoin. I gave a lengthy explanation of the current environment and got a response along the lines of "bro I'm just here to invest, make 10x my money, and get out".

You remember how a sandwich used to be $1? Well, the government's control of the money printing has lowered the value because they print so damn much of it. Sandwiches, houses, cars, services, and so much more is incredibly expensive.
Bitcoin is a technological marvel. It's a technology built on very powerful maths and the internet. The entire system runs on the internet across many, many computers, and as long as one person runs a copy of the system, it will always work. Right now, hundreds of thousands of computers on the internet are running this system, and the only way it might fail is if the entire internet fails, which probably will never happen.
So, this tool has no leader or business running it, but instead computers can vote for upgrades and policy changes, just like voting is supposed to work in the US. Overwhelming majority decides how it changes.
This money is limited in supply, and cannot be censored. So, for the first time ever, we've created money that cannot be stopped and has to operate in a way that participants vote for it to work.
Bitcoin is just as magical as the internet, and will bring more democracy to the world. Hell, it will only succeed if it is for some reason better than today's government money, so let's see how the free market interprets it. I've made my bets, and if you know me, I'm a huge fan of emerging tech. Myself and others are claiming this is something truly special, and when us nerds obsess over things, maybe you should try to learn a little more about it.

This is decentralized. People will use this technology in horribly inefficient ways. You can't make rules for them; you need to let the free market decide on this, or else we have to elect someone to centralize the environment
Let them pay high fees. The free market will starve them.
When you get mad that other people are using unnecessary space, are you assuming it is "your" space? If so, pay for that space.
This mentality leads to a slippery slope of people thinking they can tell you how to use a decentralized tech. The efficient users will have a discount while the non-efficient help encourage miners by paying more. This strengthens the network by providing more incentive to mine blocks (higher rewards than an efficient spender would use).
Just some thoughts. I am 100% for Segwit implementations, but I do not in any way expect to force anyone to use it. They can pay more if they like, and unless I am paying top mining fees for space on the block, that space isn't mine.

It would be cautiously invested:
* 50% US index funds
* 25% international index funds
* 15%  US bonds
* 10% foreign bonds
While these matured for a few years to build up a cash pool from dividends, bond payouts, and cash left over from re-adjusting positions, I'd be pretty confident in my ability to live off that forever.

It would require a pin code. You can also make a 12 word backup that represents your private key (basically the code that gives you access to your Bitcoin)

I am not. People are free to use any crypyo they wish. Show me a crypto that uses zero fee transactions and I will flood it with 100,000,000,000 transactions between both wallets back and forth as often as I can. That blockchain will be too big for people to store. There is a reason Bitcoin is still the top crypto.


For some, yes. For others, it is partial ownership of a truly decentralized protocol.


Is that why in the sea of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin still holds a &gt;50% dominance? The market doesn't lie.


When Bitcoin was first implemented, there were no fees. What happened is there was the potential for abuse by my example above by creating MASSIVE amounts of dummy transactions. In limited blockchain space, you have 2 choices I am aware of: Elect an authority to approve/deny transactions, or let a free market decide what the transaction space is worth. Electing an authority puts us in pre-crypto times. Free market was the only solution.

You need to understand something if you want to "invest" in it. If you want to speculate or bet on it without knowing what it does, go for it. That's nothing but a gamble though.
Articles? I read 20-30 articles daily that say the wildest crap about Bitcoin, crypto, etc.
Crypto is a lot like the early days of internet. We only hear about the Yahoos and the Googles, but what about the ~99% of companies that went under?
Investing anything more than 10% of your portfolio is absolutely reckless until you understand how the thing works. Would you invest 10% of your portfolio into a pharmaceutical company because one good article spoke highly about it and a friend told you to buy it? I would hope not. Same applies to BTC and just about anything else.
And if you aren't managing your own private keys, you aren't really investing in the space since you are relying upon a custodial service to manage your funds, LIKE A BANK.
You're free to put money into Bitcoin, but if you plan on selling it for fiat, you're kinda going against the main principal that makes Bitcoin special. You should read the message found in the first block (called the Genesis Block).

I kind of feel like everyone is at a standstill at the moment. We just passed the Halvening and it didn't do anything big. I think people are holding for fear of missing the skyrocket once we verify that miners are doing alright after getting their pay cut in half, but at the same time we're afraid to buy anything because of the same reason.
It jumped up a good chunk today. Tomorrow may bring some more good news once we realized that Halvenings influence the price, but don't really mix things up on a large scale.

I used to give out all the advice I could, but people were less receptive to it. Now I "consult" to people under the agreement that they can buy bitcoin off of me at a 10% convenience fee for whatever amount of bitcoin they want to buy. Once people realize they can pay to be part of the club, they get crypto-fever and keep coming back.
I've made a few $100 sales and several $20 sales here and there. Lots of $5 sales "just for fun". I enjoy talking about it and it makes me small amounts of money that I eventually use for buying even more bitcoin.
So many people are too lazy to set up coinbase or another bitcoin system. I just set them up with mycelium, and after ensuring they understand the need for backups and have proven to me they have at least 2 secure copies, I sell them bitcoin. Motivates people more than free advice and commissionless sales for some strange reason.

They're around $100 USD, and yeah they can be expensive especially if you don't have $100 worth of Bitcoin
Blockchain.info claims to give you 100% control over your keys, but once again you depend on them being secure and always online.
You could use a phone app like mycelium or breadwallet, generate the 12 word keys, (test recovering those keys from another device before moving forward), then uninstall the app. That's called cold storage since the Bitcoin access relies on keeping those 12 word keys safe.

On top of that, we have hundreds of people analyzing the open source code. This is a great security system. Bright minds want to apply themselves for this system.
On top of that, bitcoin is a pretty damn secure system. The fact that it has existed for this long without any major hack or compromise is a pretty safe bet.
Finally, all banks and financial systems run on programs. Those can be hacked (and they have been multiple times) so why do we all trust these organizations so well?

Buffet invests very specifically. He sees no value in BTC, and he might be right or he might be wrong.
Many times, he has said he goes after certain things that catch his fancy.
I assume that since BTC was the "investment of the century" and he missed it, people call out the most popular person in investing, asking why he didn't see the value in that.
I don't care what he thinks.  I care how the tech works and what problems it solves. BTC is an abstract tool that doesn't align with current financial systems, and it will be seen as a driver of change instead of the "same old story" in finance.

Yeah. People like you who have no idea how actual economics works. You think that if the price goes up, the value goes up too.


So you're part of the group of people who are manipulating the price? That makes you the jerk.
I've done extensive research on Bitcoin. I've made a site outlining how it works, I participate in several communities, I've read tons of literature out there, I've read Mastering Bitcoin 4 times already (because the material is so insanely dense), I'm running a lightning node, and I've taught well over 100 people how Bitcoin works at a local college.


That isn't why. There are many reasons why it won't work right now:
* Way too high of a skill set required to safely transact
* Network capacity cannot handle what we throw at it
* Forks, social manipulation, and a large group of people who are still afraid of computers will not buy into it
* Price is too volatile as we still try to figure out if it can even work on large scale
You have missed the entire point of Bitcoin. It is decentralized, meaning no one should be able to implement laws on how it works. It is the wild wild west, and you are running the risk of manipulation every day. What doesn't change is the finite supply and the consensus rules. That is the only guarantee you get. You wanna start tossing in manipulation rules? That's centralization. The only certainty you have is once you buy a certain % of the 21MM Bitcoin, your percentage of ownership never changes.


Dude, people will always try to manipulate a market if they are able to profit from it. Gold, silver, USD, Venezuelan currency, India's monetary policy, etc.
What we need is long term realization that this stuff works as a good store of value, and can be used for economic activity too. If a whale can come in and throw around $100,000 to manipulate the price, that's an issue. But what we truly need is a system where:
* Price gets manipulated upwards, people sell it and trade it for other valuable assets
* Price gets manipulated downwards, people sell other assets to buy into undervalued Bitcoin.
When that happens, and BTC hits a sufficient market cap, it will be damn near impossible to manipulate the price beyond a fraction of a percent, and there will be automatic trading happening to keep it in place.
Bitcoin came out 10 years ago, but up until 2 years ago, no one really knew or cared about it. So you gotta give it time. Tons of people now know what it is, and might be curious as to how it works. If they can't explain the basic concept, they aren't ready to invest.
I get what you want to do. You want everyone to invest and maybe trigger another bull run. Maybe you bought in at $15,000 and want to try to get everyone to push the price back up so you don't feel like a loser? Maybe you want to sell at a certain price to get out of the market at neutral gain/loss. Maybe you just want to fantasize about the moon and lambos.
If you think a fair market value of Bitcoin should be higher, you shouldn't be pushing others to raise the price; you should be hoping the price stays low as long as you can so you can collect as much as possible right now.

You are not the leader of Bitcoin, a DECENTRALIZED currency. I don't have to move to an altcoin, but maybe you should because you seem to want control and ownership of Bitcoin. Well, it's not up for grabs.
You notice that his way of talking is self centered and confident that he can own and control the direction of Bitcoin. Then I look at Andreas Antonopolous and realize that he doesn't say the direction he wants Bitcoin to go, he simply reacts to what he sees others do. He describes how the ecosystem works, as opposed to how his own opinion of Bitcoin should work.
I wonder who is going to go down in history as the leader of Bitcoin... The one who wants to be a king, or the one who wants to see where the people bring themselves...

Dude, get your Bitcoin spread out over MANY accounts. I'm not sure why you're leaving Bitcoin in custodial accounts.
Buy a trezor, set that up with 25% of your Bitcoin
Buy a ledger. 25%
Buy a raspberry pi and set up Linux as a clean fresh install. Generate a wallet. 25% storage.
Spread the last 25% into various other methods such as blockchain.info and maybe even consider some reputable exchanges to ensure you have top level security holding your wealth.
Don't be the victim of losing all your wealth. I'd also even consider selling 25% and diversifying it in various currencies and stocks.
You have lifelong financial security at your hands. Not too many other people have that. I'd go to great lengths to secure your holdings.

Satoshi saw a potential risk. Andreas Antonopolous spoke of Prometheus, the Greek god who stole fire from the gods and gave it to the people. As a punishment he was chained to a wall and had an eagle rip out his liver daily.
I imagine if Satoshi were identified, he would be punished for stealing fire(control of money) and giving it to the people.

I run a small chat of ~12 experts in various fields, and we all kinda feel the next run is going to be important, as people will see their third "dramatic rise in price, with a crash that still leaves early investors ahead of the game". They will now realize the trick isn't to buy and immediately sell into profit, but keep riding the waves as the value increases. There may be a lot of waves (volatility), but the general direction is still up.

So my conclusion is:
If national money is so great, as governments would like us to believe, this shouldn't be an issue at all. Clearly, fiat will be the best choice of the world to embrace, and we will all reject cryptocurrency in unison because of the benefits awarded to us by a currency our government controls.

I think this is worth discussing, because I honestly disagree.
The Bitcoin network is decentralized, meaning it does not discriminate against any type of transactions. All transactions are EQUAL, just like any website or email can also be trash, but still valued equally on the internet.
The Bitcoin system was built to not discriminate, so as long as you pay the fee, your transaction goes through, whether it be a charitable donation, paying a friend, buying from a store, or donating to WikiLeaks. Pushing Bitcoin to transaction capacity is worth the fees to someone, so the transaction goes through. Want your transaction to take priority because you think it is more valuable than this "trash"? Prove it by paying more.
This is the Bitcoin network. Andreas Antonopolous speaks about this a lot, and this "problem" is a result of having a free decentralized system. I see it as a benefit in the long-run. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 18:32:25


Which ones? Very cool, if true.


Because try performing a micro-transaction anywhere via a credit card. Or what happens when all payment facilitators in unison ban a business?


In the long run, Bitcoin has rose in value to be greater than a $100B market cap. Extreme volatility is nothing new to seasoned BTC veterans.




Governments are stealing. Every time they print more money to fund a war, project, replace miraculously missing money, bail out banks, etc., They lower the spending power of all other dollars. This is why your grandmother's lifetime savings of $20,000, that which could have bought a brand new home in her prime time, now only serves as a 10% down payment. Her savings slowly but surely loses buying power over the decades.

I would be careful of these "airdrops", as they can be used for a replay attack ("repeat" the spending of coins signed on the core fork), and you can also easily be identified when you move coins on, let's say, BCH. If you move them via that fork, the exchange will know you had the coins on the other fork too.
Just some thoughts.
I am personally keeping all forked coins. Who knows how the market plays out? They may be worth more than they are now. I'll make that decision also when I feel more privacy implementations are put in place.

Yeah and if you dollar-cost-averaged your way into Bitcoin at just about any point in history you'd have no regrets. In fact you'd be quite proud of your success.

If you look at older internet applications, sending data in the form of text was the "killer app". People had a hard time imagining smart data such as photos, videos, interactive applications, etc. Now those are huge driving forces.
How we use money is going to change dramatically, and I can't even imagine how. My best guess is a payable web, where everything you do costs a tiny fraction of a cent to operate. The money is given to the website/content creator. No more need for ads.

So here's the thing about Bitcoin. We will always try to push it to capacity. There's no number where we'll all agree "alright, that's enough. Everybody stay within this limit and we're good". If we did that, we would still be using dialup service to load basic HTML pages. But we didn't accept those speeds. Someone though to include images, so we needed faster speeds. Then at a 1mb line, video emerged. Now we have the average household with 3 or 4 people streaming HD video simultaneously.
If you give us 10,000 TPS someone will find a way to use all them. If you give us 100,000,000 TPS we will figure out a way to use all 100,000,000 TPS.

The whole point I'm trying to bring up is that many things can happen that will tank the price of Bitcoin:
* Make it illegal
* Regulate it to death by making other use illegal
* A better crypto comes out that makes Bitcoin worthless

Now imagine if everyone tried to do this at once. There wouldn't be enough bitcoin to satisfy everyone's account. Sounds a lot like fractional reserve banking to me. I thought a major point of bitcoin was to escape things like that...

If miners leave, difficulty goes down. We still need mainchain transactions to still happen to settle all payments in a channel, but lightning allows us to make a bunch of payments all in one.
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:13:40
If you don't think this is going to happen to BTC, you've got a big surprise coming your way.
BTC is for keeps. No refunds, chargebacks, or even possibly cancellations of payments. Once you send it, it is gone.
Companies are going to be so tight with the money, because there are no insurance programs to pay them back. Insuring crypto by FDIC is going to be very difficult, or very expensive as crypto progresses.

I'm expecting a lot of these mini price jumps, with much more selloffs. Lots of people are afraid of getting burned, so they're going to claim smaller profits thinking they'll beat the crash.
Give that a few cycles and FOMO will cause them to buy into it right after selling

If a company is willing to take an ICO and use it to fund vacation, what else will they do for money? Compromised wallets, ads, premium version?
Remember, Bitcoin is an environment where you shouldn't ever need to trust anyone, and this company allowed people to place trust in their company, and look what they did with it. Vacations.
The Bitcoin ecosystem is going to be a very strict reputation-based environment. If I have a sliver of doubt in a company, I'm not trusting them with my Bitcoin.

And that's completely fine. He doesn't have to give a reason, nor does he have to invest in it.
So many people here want him to invest because it validates their speculation. They aren't confident enough to accept that not everyone will agree with them.
If you know how the tech works and have a decent knowledge of the early days of the internet, you see why this is such a great opportunity.

I can't see how miners are okay with this. Bitmain hardware could quadruple in price based on the monopoly they are enabling. Easy way to turn your profits down to juuuust enough to stay in business, but not enough to innovate or take any risks.

We are barely seeing decent wallets emerge. How would you configure multisig when an app is just trying to work natively via one sig?
Do you install dual instances of the wallet? Do you use two separate wallets? Do you keep a server running at home to "approve" the second signature needed?
There's a lot of complicated processes with this. I can tell you, that the first app to emerge will probably get niche success while everyone else feels it is too complicated to use.
Maybe we will see this with a hardware wallet first? LIke, have both a Trezor and Ledger required to spend larger amounts of money? I'd try that with small amounts of BTC.

Yup. And charge money (or beers) for your advice/knowledge/time. You are not obligated to tell people everything they want to know, on their terms. If you give them free advice, they will blame you when their investment doesn't play out like they had dreamed. However if they do get a nice payout, it was entirely their "hard work".
I was telling people to be careful in BTC around $12-15k, but said it seems reasonable to invest $100 monthly into it, noting there is a risk of it crashing. A few people put a few grand into it and flipped out on me saying I had to pay them back because I "promised" they would get insane returns.
This is why I now charge money. Fewer people will get mad if they paid and got bad advice, but give it to them for free and it sounds like you are attaching a guarantee to it.

This is what's interesting.
I have people saying "I'll invest later when I can learn more about it". They invest finally. Then, they say "why aren't I doubling my money immediately?"
The world doesn't revolve around your investment choices. Stop expecting exciting things to happen as a result of you doing a single exciting thing...
A friend actually explained this as a "logical argument". If he buys Bitcoin, the price should go up by a few pennies. Then, people will see the price rose, and as a result they'll want to invest more, thus raising the price. Eventually that will chain react into everyone buying it, and raise the price even more. He ended up selling at a ~5% loss because Bitcoin is obviously just a scam. Can't wait to send him screencaps at $10,000.

I have a 20 question worksheet for students to fill out, and if they do, they get like $3 in Bitcoin to play with. I issue them a paper wallet and keep a copy, telling them they have 1 week to figure out how to stop me from taking the money back. Once you threaten a person's money by "taking it back", they make sure they research the heck out of it.
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:49:23
While true, many first time investors immediately assume the first crash that happened during their investment period is the big one. We tend to place ourselves at the "most important" part of the event and think everything revolves around us.
