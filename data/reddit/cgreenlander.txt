Mick, I have to confirm what these other posters are saying: the cancellation algorithm you guys use have some serious problems.  I had a lot of frustration with it.  It is the  complaint about Coinbase on this reddit.  
It also frustrated people that you take two or three days after the transaction has started to cancel.  Why does it take so long to figure it out?
Some more transparency about what you are doing here would calm everyone's nerves a lot.

You're confusing grants of restricted stock with incentive stock options (ISOs).
The section 83(b) election applies to grants of restricted stock.
Incentive stock options are a whole different beast.  There is a "tax preference" for the "bargain element" of ISOs that are exercised and held past the end of the tax year in which they are exercised.  Section 83(b) elections are completely inapplicable in this case.

I stopped using Coinbase entirely after this happened to me during a big run-up.  I went back to using MtGox.
I'm optimistic that Coinbase will get better and in a few months or a year they will have their act together more.  Remember: right now Coinbase consists of exactly TWO guys (unless I missed the announcement that the founder hired his second engineer).
Until then, it's hard to recommend anyone use Coinbase.

If the price breaks through 100 it could take off like a bullet.  If you look at the chart of bid/ask orders on MtGox, there is almost no resistance after 100.

Bitcoinwireless ( is a scam.  I sent them bitcoins to add to my account.  I didn't receive any credit, they ignored my emails and refused to even acknowledge that there was an issue when I wrote about it at bitcointalk.org.

Yes, I'm getting that too.  Funny, I thought it was just me until I saw your post.

I've also been having problems with canceled transactions on coinbase.  I've been buying coins every day for about 30 days.  The first 20 days had no transactions canceled, but in the last few days I've had 2 canceled.  My behavior on the site hasn't varied, and the whole idea that these two recent transactions are "suspicious" is just odd to me.
The canceled transactions have been ones that were at low prices.
I wonder if Coinbase is trying to make a little extra money by canceling orders that occur before a significant price rise.  If they're smart, they're buying bitcoins at the same time the user hits "buy" on their site.  If the bitcoin price goes down after that and Coinbase cancels the transaction, then Coinbase has to eat the difference.  But if the bitcoin price rises after that and Coinbase cancels the transaction, then the spread is just profit for Coinbase.
And certainly they'd have plausible deniability.  They're not doing it because the the price went up.  Your transaction was obviously SUSPICIOUS and APPEARED TO BE FRAUDULENT!  It's all just a coincidence.
Certainly I don't have any evidence, but the circumstances are suspicious.

In either case, the units aren't correct... even if you set aside the question of whether the building will glow or not.
A watt-hour (Wh) or kilowatt-hour (kWh) is a measure of energy.  A statement like "it eats up 17.3 kWh of electricity for every square foot" can't be correct in any sense unless it also states a measure of time, e.g., "it eats up 17.3 kWh of electricity for every square foot per hour".
Or, better yet, the statement should just use watts (W), kilowatts (kW).  A kilowatt-hour per hour is a kilowatt.  These are measures of power (energy per time), not energy itself.

Can anyone explain what "Encrypting your wallet will reset the 100 pre-generated addresses that are used for change and new addresses." mean in this context?
When I think of encrypting a wallet, I think about putting it on an encrypted drive with something like TrueCrypt.  Obviously TrueCrypt isn't going to open the wallet file and change all the keys.
So I must misunderstand "encrypt" in this context.  Is there some function inside the bitcoin client that will change all the unused pre-generated addresses/keys?

I use Dwolla-&gt;mtgox, but I agree with thoughtcourier that it is a major PITA to get verified... and the ACH transfer needed to get money into Dwolla takes several days: it's slower than a wire transfer.
My advice is to just eat the wire transfer fee and do a wire transfer straight to MtGox.
You can find banks that will do cheap wire transfers.  Discount brokers (Fidelity, Schwab, Etrade) usually have better wire transfer fees than banks.  You can find international wire transfers as cheap as $15-$20 if you look around.

It seems like it's missing some paths.  For instance, if I have a dwolla account and want bitcoins, the best path is mtgox.  The total cost of this path is about 0.6%.
Yet your site shows Dwolla-&gt;BitInstant-&gt;bitcoin, which is a 4% path

When I was using Coinbase, I noticed that transactions that got reversed because they were "suspicious" would just "disappear" as if they didn't happen.
That's not really an appropriate thing to do.  If they're going to reverse a transaction, then both the original transaction and the reversal should show up as individual line items in my transaction history.
You know, like a real financial institution...

Think Computer Corporation has documented their dispute with the State of California in great detail, including scans of all the physical correspondence.  
If you read through the history, it's pretty clear that Think Computer Corporation got screwed by California.  California classified him as a money transmitter, but refused to clearly define the bar needed for him to become one.  It's obviously a case of favoring the big guy for now reason.  Facebook and BoA can be money transmitters, because they're big.  You're not big, you're a scrub, now go to get job at Facebook like the other scrubs.
Obviously, this latest lawsuit makes him look like an obnoxious dickhead.  I can nevertheless sympathize with his action here, which is to lash out at an obviously unfair system.

I just bought a $5 amazon card using bitcoin and successfully applied it to my account.
Great site, great idea, great execution.  Thanks Vinny!  I'll definitely be using Gyft in the future.
The only thing I didn't like was that there is no option to register directly on your site: I'm forced to use Google/Facebook to login.

I tried it for the first time yesterday.
I followed the instructions to send 0.4239 BTC to some address.  Some time later I got a confirmation that the funds were received.   The message said "You should now wait to receive a third email, which provides instructions from your carrier in order to credit your mobile phone.  This email may take up to a few hours to receive."
I didn't receive the follow-up email or the credit on my phone after 24 hours.  They've ignored a follow-up email as well as a message I sent from the contact form on their web site.
At best, they're disorganized and their customer support sucks.
At worst, it's a scam.
I've already decided that I won't use them again.  I'm interested in hearing if anyone else has successfully gotten credit.

they're also making money by canceling orders after the bitcoin price goes up.

At the end of the article, there was a comment "And if that does happen, alternative cryptocurrencies like Ripple will take its place, substituting in a globally distributed network of trust for mining."
My God, if Bitcoin dies let's hope that something BESIDES Ripple emerges in its place.

Thanks, it's better.
I have one more question: how to you calculate "Approximate percentage of market value after all fees / charges"?  For instance, in the dwolla-&gt;mtgox path, the total cost is 0.6%.  (Dwolla charges a flat $0.25, but that's just noise for a transaction of any size.)  Yet you show a charge more than 1%.  Perhaps you're assuming a small transaction size where the $0.25 is significant?
In any event, great site... something the community really needs.

only because you have a clue about how evil Paypal is.
poor naive foreigners think that Paypal is an honest institution, like a bricks-and-mortor bank or something.
