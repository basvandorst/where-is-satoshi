 shows 15% of all existing goTenna Mesh nodes (rest are not self-reported) — you can also filter for stationary mesh nodes left connected to power (solar, outlet, etc.)

Would be even better if you joined us at  -- we have a bunch of devs and blockchain people too on there. Good to get ideas in front of people who might collaborate or donate time/resources.

You can see records &amp; field reports regarding range/performance of goTenna Mesh here: 
@_date: 2018-05-15 01:03:55
It works on UHF frequencies — you don't have a UHF radio in your phone. UHF gives you really good range and as a result a scalable mesh network that can more reliably provide connectivity per this whitepaper:

You're really gonna hawk the URL you're squatting on to an open-source project? We'll pay what you paid for it today, but not looking to get scammed as thanks for creating/contributing to an open-source project, ya know :)

Right. More details on how TxTenna works here:

Hi, good morning. Is that a "yes" to selling it to us for what you paid for it? Great and thanks. If so, please DM me and I/Samourai will pay you (in crypto) :)

Daniela, goTenna cofounder here, because goTenna operates at lower frequencies than FMRS radios the range and propagation is much better. In fact, if goTenna is to be compared to walkie-talkies at all, it's more comparable to Garmin RINOs (though still better, IMHO!) which cost $400-700 for a single unit.
@_date: 2018-05-16 05:35:54
It's $179 for 2, or $85 for each. Plus there's lots of discount codes if you look online. Gets cheaper still if you buy 4-packs or 8-packs..

Right! The last hop can be an off-grid satellite up-link or cross a national border. Unlinking the sender from the subscriber ID is part of it, but also physically broadcasting allows you to tap in to a wider variety of routes to the internet and bitcoin blockchain.

You *can* do something with BTC! :) Using our SDK the possibilities are endless... gotenna.com/pages/developer

goTenna's range, because it operates in the 151-154 MHz VHF frequencies, is much greater than your regular walkie-talkie. The propagation characteristics of those frequencies enable the waves to travel through matter, don't require line-of-sight, and so make it usable even in urban environments.
@_date: 2014-09-05 18:58:04
Ahhhhh! Good question. Something I've thought of a lot, obviously.
My guess is that it's because when MURS was licensed for public use it was before text was widely used, so the FCC was thinking mostly of real-time voice comms which, if meshing, would clog up the network immediately. They weren't thinking of short-burst asynchronous comms like data that have much lower bandwidth and can really scale.
@_date: 2014-09-05 19:47:41
Not GSM as such, but it's easy enough to make a jammer for any frequency band.
There's nothing anyone can do about jammers, but on the plus side they typically only jam a smallish area. Anything that could jam a large area would also cook the person holding it. o_O
@_date: 2014-09-05 14:19:39
The FCC is a true thorn in our ass, but we are working on it... ;) Stay tuned!
(P.S. The FCC was created only about a decade before Tesla died. Regulatory issues weren't really a concern for him, haha)
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:05:00
Where are you located? Curious to see how we can help (I'm a goTenna founder)
@_date: 2018-05-16 05:34:35
I'm not a robot - just a real girl!
@_date: 2014-09-05 18:57:13
Definitely. To be precise goTenna's throughput is:
19,200 baud = 19.2K bits/sec = 2.4K bytes
@_date: 2014-09-05 16:38:09
Not when SHTF! As was the case during Hurricane Sandy here in NYC which is what inspired me to build goTenna. When cell towers go down and power is out, your smartphone is useless. Not any longer now with goTenna! :)
But the urban uses for goTenna are limited in non-emergency scenarios... unless you want to use it to text for free or super privately. There are also gaming use-cases for it. One guy is using our SDK to build a LARPing game ;)

goTenna's transmission rate goes up to 19,200 baud. You can use our SDK to build apps that use goTenna, but our EULA will hold you to not doing the illegal stuff like store-and-forward. You'd be liable if the FCC found you. ;)
You will *not* be able to mess with higher output. The SDK governs the software only.

That is not fair to my gender. Let's not generalize either way -- there are tech-dumb and tech-savvy people on either side of the chromosomes.
@_date: 2014-07-21 16:38:48
We are not marketing to any gender specifically. Although I'm not sure why marketing to women should cause any scorn. ;)
We do like the idea of people using this for BTC applications though! Hopefully our SDK will be used for all sorts of novel BTC use-cases.
@_date: 2014-09-05 19:02:41
I get it's not for everyone, but what we learned as we developed this is that more people wanted asynchronous data comms as opposed to real-time voice. And when I say "more," I mean like, 75% of testers preferred the former.
From a networking perspective, as well, it makes our ad hoc reconfigurable network more scalable if we're focused on short-burst transmissions that are, technically speaking, delay-tolerant. This means that even if you're at a huge event with tons of people using goTenna, even if a gajillion of them press "send" at the exact same femtosecond, all the messages can get through in a matter of seconds if not milliseconds.
Even FRMS radios have a clogging problem. goTenna automatically (using super-smart novel networking protocols) shares and selects channels for you without you ever having to do anything and never having to "interrupt" another conversation. ;)
@_date: 2014-09-05 18:59:04
We use BTLE, or Bluetooth-LE, the new standard which is super power-efficient and doesn't drop often. Pretty reliable.
We aren't building a PC app, but you can with our SDK! :)

Range records shared by the community are here — several people have gotten dozen miles or so, the record is currently 69 mi (no meshing): [

Daniela from goTenna here. We like to underpromise and overdeliver. Having tested a million walkie-talkies, I'd love to know which one actually got 22 mi point to point? That's what their packaging says but in real life that's not what they get. ;)
We like to say 1-3 again to give people realistic USUAL expectations. With meshing you can double, triple, quadruple (etc...) your range. And our current point to point record is 47 mi: 
@_date: 2016-09-29 20:32:12
Right but worth noting that ultimately all data is 1's and 0's so as long as you packetize things to fit our protocols -- which is optimized to make the most scalable mesh network on scarce, shared public spectrum -- you can drip anything over and reconstruct it at the other end. One of our SDK beta developers this summer is sending images and videos. Takes longer of course, but works

Hi, I'm Daniela, goTenna cofounder/CEO. I'm about to pass out because I've not slept properly in the last days preparing for the announcement launch, but I'm so glad you like the general price point we're trying to hit later. goTenna Mesh is as low as $64.50/unit right now during the KS campaign but it will be $89.50 later ($179/2). We'd love to get prices down over time with economies of scale. In meantime we did drop the price of goTenna v1 to $149/2 which is $75/unit roughly. :-)
@_date: 2016-09-29 20:56:05
Hey thanks for already being a goTenna v1 user!
The reason we couldn't have mesh functionality on the v1 product is due to regulatory reasons. The FCC prohibits it on the MURS frequencies. We're too small a company to fight a regulatory battle (time/money/uphill battle).
I would've loved to have the v1 product mesh but it just can't due to laws. And while I'd love to have the v1 and goTenna Mesh devices interoperate, the laws of physics won't allow it (entirely different spectrum). 
That being said, I love our v1 product, and it's still the best point to point range in the outdoors you're gonna get because it's 2W VHF (v. 1W UHF). We're not sunsetting the v1 right now because it's still a great product that people love -- plus it's available right now ;-)
@_date: 2016-09-29 00:16:47
Anyway really hope you all have fun developing on the SDK: [gotenna.com/pages/sdk](
I've always liked the idea of off-grid financial transactions on goTenna. Emerging market &amp; emergency applications beyond even general BTC fandom
@_date: 2016-09-29 20:26:40
Thanks that 's nice of you :-)
@_date: 2016-09-29 20:27:38
We've developed our own MANET protocols -- our P2P protocol powers our v1 product and is called Aspen Prime. Our mesh protocol which powers goTenna Mesh is called Aspen Grove.
@_date: 2016-09-29 20:29:59
Definitely. While goTenna can be an off-grid parallel network and we optimize for that, it's not meant to never interconnect with centralized networks. In fact, somewhat lost in the news coverage of goTenna Mesh's launch yesterday is the fact that yesterday we also released our first interconnection via SMS network relay. Also we released the SDK which enables anyone to build other network relays before we have time to get to them ;-)
@_date: 2016-09-29 20:30:35
Our open SDK has been used by both public safety organizations for SAR applications as well as medical IT companies for sensor comms. Use it! It's all in the possibility of the platform, I think 
@_date: 2016-09-29 20:28:41
It 100% needs numbers to achieve the true potential of mesh -- the blue-sky possibilities! -- so share, share, share the campaign. Support it however you can (even if it's just to donate $10 to our NGO partner Telecommunications Without Borders which does rad humanitarian work everywhere from Syria to Haiti)
I will point out, however, that meshing can be useful in groups of as small as 3. So there's that ;-)
