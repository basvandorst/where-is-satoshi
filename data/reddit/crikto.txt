Total bullshit numbers. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 08:44:48
Well becouse i know that these numbers dont ad up. For example i live in the Nederlands and over here there is a big diffrence between private en corperate kosts for electricitie. My btc doesnt cost anything near wat is stated here. Actualy i still make profit. Hoe would jou rime that with these numbers?

What facts??? What is the energie consumption of traditional banking??? Paper, vaults, banks, datacenters, transport etc etc.

Does it? Not to me. Eventualy the balance is on the wrong side. Who wil Pay your interest then? Emergency funds wil be inefficiënt and you dont own the keys. Good luck

If you understand crypto you dont want fiat. Hoi want it and its corrupt underlaying system to vanish.

Like what? Lol the only thing they do is help you make debt or pay way to much for crappy service. If  there is ons branche we can miss its banking. People need  to learn to live without debt and spend what they own instead of making  debts. Every  time banks f**k up, the taxpayer can bail them out while banks keep giving bonusses to boardmembers.
