Thanks for your comment :)
I have looked at Git in the past...I will have another look when I get the chance :) thanks.
As a side note, I have no idea how many people have looked at my website or downloaded the files as everything wanted all sorts to be able to track everything else, so I either couldn't or didnt... :)
Cheers again for your comment :)

Sorry everyone - you know "Release Day" is quite a complicated day... :)
BAT Files can now also be downloaded from the BDUI website - 
Have fun reading those... :)
Cheers :)

I just realised that the only way to get the source code was to run the installer - not any more... :)
The source code can now be downloaded from a link on the BDUI website - 
As you will see, there are a few files... :)
If the file doesn't open on your pc, you need to download a compression program to open .7z files - I use 7Zip - 
Cheers :)

All the bat files are in the BATFILES folder - they should open in notepad - you should be able to right click a file and select edit and it should open in notepad - but don't double click the file or it will run the bat file instead... :)

:) this is not a joke - this is for real - and I promise it doesn't steal private keys - your comment makes me smile...
In fact, you are completely correct to be suspicious - thats why I included the source code, which is fairly easy to understand, even for a beginner like me :) I think the files should open in notepad, but I haven't tested that, sorry...
Thankyou for your honest comment, and please post more if you use BDUI - thanks! :)
BDUI works well as a front-end to download the blockchain before using Armory, which then creates its own database from the bitcoin blockchain database...and seems to go to offline mode when you say you want to manage the bitcoind.exe process yourself...but hey ho, am sure that can be sorted somehow...am sure its nothing to do with BDUI...
Cheers again for your comment :)
I could post the source code in text into webpages, but would people trust that? :)
Also, theres a lot of screens so the code would go on for a bit...
kinda damned either way really - I hope someone does do a code review and verify oneday - that would be awesome please, thanks, anyone...? :)
Cheers :)
