Coinbase requires a lot of authenticating yourself, robinhood allows you to trade crypto. I don't think it's popular here, and I def wouldn't use it to trade a lot, but I also wouldn't recommend trading a lot in general. It's what I use.

I don't know how old your wallet is, but on mine, I have a GUI. search 'Bitcoin' and the icon is the orange Bitcoin 'B.' Run it and it will take a while to sync, but once it does or is close you can open the GUI which tells you a balance (I just did this after not opening mine for a while). 
Otherwise you can run from your command window:
open command window **Run&gt; 'cmd'**
Do into whatever folder your bitcoind (with a 'd') stuff is in. You can check this with something like [Run&gt;%APPDATA%\Bitcoin]( 
Then go into that in your command window **cd C:\Users\aiden\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin** for me
then run bitcoind -getbalance
this last part not working for me for some reason

Thank you, I've had bitcoin for a while, my own wallets, made multiple transactions, and even made a website with transactions all without really understanding the concept of a wallet.
To clear one last thing up - a wallet is more analogous to a bank vault in that there can be many 'safe deposit boxes' which would be analogous to funds associated with a private key. It is possible to change the private key for some funds, but you couldn't necessarily access all the funds in a wallet with one private key.

I'm going to take fault with two parts of your argument. 


A lot of people think in this way, but I think there are a (growing) number of people who feel unfulfilled because they have everything they need except for meaning in their lives. Such is the nature of an advanced capitalist society, where less workers are needed to make a lot, and those who are might find themselves doing a very specialized task they don't enjoy or just some meaningless managerial bullshit. I think that's the most pervasive form of modern unhappiness - existential hopelessness, not material jealousy.


A lot of the hard work that goes into making great things wouldn't be possible without greed - but technological change can be a labor of love as well. A ton of our tech is ultimately attributable to curious physicists. And let's not forget about *bitcoin*. That's like the ultimate counterpoint. Still, the hard work of making bitcoin more user friendly is very greed-based.

Thanks for the info - I will. Maybe I was in too much of a rush to get this up for the TdF. I think the issue was that I did not have my walletpassphrase set - part of the registration logic creates an 'account' in my wallet and that probably failed. It's set now

I love Joe, but he really doesn't have much tolerance for deep knowledge. It's usually what makes him a great podcaster - he doesn't try to steal the show, but rather to let guests 'blow his mind.' I wish that he would be a little more excited by this stuff, which is more interesting than maybe anything right now. It's like he just can't get the really cool stuff b/c it's technical and therefore must be boring.

Want of personal gain doesn't preclude idealistic support of bitcoin. But, yeah, some here refuse to acknowledge the obvious. On the rare occasion that I mention bitcoin to someone, their reaction isn't "what's bitcoin?," but rather "what happened to bitcoin?" This is reflected in the price charts. I'm holding onto my one coin and hoping for a good 2015 for all the wrong and right reasons, but not optimistic.

in the west, banks receive money from the ECB or the Fed reserve or some other central banking authority - which comes from IOUs to the rest of the world, or your taxes or just reckless printing of cash that has no basis in reality (and should theoretically devalue the currency and even lead to hyperinflation, bank runs, ww2, etc).
They recieve this money at very low, 0 or even negative interest rates. It's free money. Then they lend it out at a higher rate. Ok, you can see that as a service fee or whatever. As a poor person who doesn't do any kind of crazy banking, I don't really have any "wtf bank?" moments unless I am sending money abroad, in which case I avoid banks.
If banks only engaged in 'normal banking' that would be fine, but they engage in the risky gambling that you would expect an entity with access to easy money to engage in. The 2008 housing crash was them issuing subprime loans - something that should have been illegal had they not lobbied the fuck out of congress (sidenote, don't vote for hillary). 
Then when *they* fucked everything up, *they* got the bailouts, *their* CEOs are rewarded handsomely, *their* traders and investment bankers are rewarded handsomely for not really providing any kind of value to the economy. BTC provides value to the economy not only by being a currency that doesn't require a bloated infrastructure, but especially as the current bloated infrastructure is not just some benign bureaucracy. The concern I have with BTC is that it's fixed amount could lead to price volatility, also bank lending has lead to a lot of the cool shit we have - and has almost always involved banks giving out more than they actually have. I'm sure there are ways to do this with BTC, and I'm sure there are companies doing it, but I don't get how you would when every BTC transaction has to be approved on the block chain.

What about all the things you take for granted - things that are made in big plants far from the center of towns. like the little plastic spoon you eat your wonton soup with that you got from a hip place that accepts bitcoins. The economy is massive and interconnected and it runs on fiat. Bitcoin can be a (growing) niche means of exchange but it's not going to replace credit/debit cads, which, at the consumer level, is pretty much money-for-dummies. At a larger (corporate/governmental level), USD is basically free money (subsidies and bailouts courtesy of the fed and HARD WORKING americans, wars, corrupt pols, etc). Why would people want to give up free and easy? Because it's *better*? Apples are better for you than Cheetos but if you look around you'll notice there are a lot of fat bastards
