anyone care to explain what this means?

actually, can the OP verify the claim that Bitmain owns BTC.TOP? A google search identifies them as separate, but the chart is displaying it as a BITMAIN organization.

Will figuratively suck my own dick if this happens before a bearish reversal below $9k, at the least.

They somehow seemed to have missed the premise of a decentralized currency.

It actually might have the momentum to inflate to $10k. If it does, I'd definitely not try to play against the RSI gods and sell before the short.

The 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, 6hr, 12hr, and 1d RSI's all show (extremely) overbought conditions. If anyone's been paying attention to the BTC volume by candle and the (relatively) unchanged volatility between the $6k mark and the (now) $9500 mark, they'd be worried. 
Watching the order sheet alone would worry me. The price is being artificially propped up. Next time you start to see a small downward sell-off, watch as small orders at $9xxx.01 start to constantly refill over and over before they're depleted at ~10BTC an order, refusing to fall below that value. Then look at the volume of that candle on the 5min graph. It's being artificially kept high to hyperinflate the price. No, I don't think it'll spiral back to even $6k, but I do wholeheartedly believe a bearish reversal back down to ~$7500 is imminent within the next week. 
Edit: 
Just to note the price is currently ~$9,550 at the time of posting this - just to show my gf if I'm right. Need her to think I'm smart. I'll hide it if I'm wrong, ofc. Can't have her knowing about that.
