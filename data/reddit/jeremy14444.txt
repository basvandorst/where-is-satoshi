Fees are always super high on atms, but it's definitely cool to use. Just don't use it as a way to buy thousands of dollars of bitcoin consistently
@_date: 2019-07-22 23:26:17
Yeah I don't believe it but it's pretty entertaining to read
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:49:42
Lol what?
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:26:12
1. Greater usage = greater popularity = more miners. Less usage = drop in price = drop in difficulty = more miners.
2. Kinda confusing, sounds like an opinion. You aren't spending money to mine and you *are* investing in bitcoin as a reward for mining. I think that's what a counter to what you said would be, again not sure what you meant
3. Bitcoin's difficulty is manually increased per block after a certain amount of time (i think one year) to combat the advances in technology and the fact that more people are mining. It also increases depending on how many miners there are (it light actually increase depending on total computing power, which would be even better)
4. Kinda confusing again; a quick google search would tell you that you don't make money from mining by donating electricity: you are donating CPU/GPU cycles. Yes, this uses electricity but x amount of electricity doesn't equal y amount of bitcoin for each person (CPUs and GPUs can vary  in power consumption, efficiency, and computing power)
There's all your points for ya ;)
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:44:03
I guess so lol
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:17:41
Good point didn't think of it like that
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:54:03
Lmao at 12900 who does that
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:10:52
Yeah looking into that... Probably gonna end up just holding onto bitcoin for a few years and hoping it goes up :)

I agree with your third paragraph in that it is safer to give opportunities to people instead of money, but for some money is what they need to get going. For your second paragraph, wealthier people, to an extent, are better with money however there are always the few that use hundred dollar bills as toilet paper just because they can. People will buy unnecessary items just because they can, and they have every right to do so, but it isn't always the best decision. I'm sure that you could find the opposite, however, in that less wealthy people can make very well thought out decisions for the long and short term based around the fact that they cannot afford to lose as much as a wealthier person may. As for your last paragraph, won't the amount invested by a poorer person be scaled to that of someone that is wary of loss but is doing well financially? I agree that poorer people may not be able to afford much and so it may not be smart to spend money on investments, but a $10,000 investment to a wealthier person would be similar to, say, a $100 investment to a person with a lot less money?

In mine ;)
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:34:48
Lol is it that bl8?
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:36:18
Yea not looking forward to that lol
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:05:43
Guess I'm one of the ones to be left out lol... hope you do well gl :)
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:02:55
Its difficult. If it were easy, everyone would do it. Im not very good at it and Im just tempted to grab some bitcoin, hold onto it, and see where it takes me. Good luck to you in the future :)
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:12:20
But with almost $13,000,000? I mean good luck to them but jeez
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:52:00
Lmao fuck off lol
@_date: 2019-07-22 23:21:57

I am like 15 minutes away from it and I forget the name but if I stop by again I'll send it
@_date: 2019-07-25 21:39:37
That's like saying:
Q: What would someone that has killed people for fun in the past do when given the opportunity to kill someone without consequences?
Obviously someone that pisses away money will piss away money. I think it's stupid that people think all people that are poor are just "bad at utilizing" money. They could have some sort of mental illness that prevents them from being accepted into jobs, a criminal background (same reason), drug habits (in which case they may need money for therapy or whatever, obviously you shouldn't directly give a person with an addiction money).
I get what you're trying to say, but I don't completely understand your last paragraph although I agree with most of it.
@_date: 2019-07-10 12:21:01
Bought at like 11k so I guess it was worth it
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:54:06
Sounds like an opinion... sources?
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:18:20
Yup seems like bitcoin is just gonna keep going up so ill try it out. Thanks for the advice and the website btw:)
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:05:58
Wish you the best :)
@_date: 2019-11-05 02:28:58
Holy shit why is everyone so mad that this guy reposted? It's taking more time for you to comment than to scroll past it, and by scrolling past it you're not giving an opinion no one asked for. Just saying.
@_date: 2019-11-05 18:09:05
My man
@_date: 2019-11-18 14:51:54
Just make a legacy wallet on electrum and then send it to a Segwit address on a different electrum wallet and delete the original (or keep it, up to you)
@_date: 2019-11-11 19:31:13
I mean not to support gold or anything but you can use micrograms/milligrams like you can satoshis.... but nobody is going to break a piece of gold small enough for a $5 cheeseburger and drink

Benim shows some tutorials and does reviews
@_date: 2019-08-25 01:34:36
You could take a world download and look at it there, or get a resource pack as some other people have said, or download a hacked client and use X-ray to see through the lava... definitely don't store wallets this way
@_date: 2019-12-09 15:13:06
Bad choice

It's time for the Dogecoin comeback
@_date: 2019-12-11 19:58:34
We were below 6,900 recently but other than that great post
@_date: 2019-12-29 15:57:06
Lmao whats with the hostility I just said I'm skeptical because they only accepted Bitcoin, but the OP said that they were mistaken and they actually do accept credit cards. I want Bitcoin to become widely used as much as anyone else, but I also realize that from a sales perspective you're losing money so it's better for a company to accept both currencies if they want to make more.
@_date: 2019-12-13 14:57:18
99% of answers will be Trezor or Ledger Nano s/x. I personally own a Ledger Nano X and it works fine, feels a bit plastic-y but I like it. Cold Card is another popular one. It's personal preference. Don't listen to people on eBay saying you should use a pre-generated seed, as thats a common scam from people selling hardware wallets. If you aren't buying from eBay/another person, you shouldn't have this problem
@_date: 2019-12-13 18:08:58
Sounds good. Thanks for your help
@_date: 2019-12-17 12:45:18
I mean mining is already pretty centralized due to mining pools, and if people stop mining then the difficulty will go down so others will take their place (at least that's my understanding of how it works). So unless the pools take up that space from the people that left, it won't really become more centralized.
@_date: 2019-12-29 15:59:09
It's a replica and I mean it's entirely possible but I just find it strange that BTC is the only currency accepted when that would most likely hurt sales
@_date: 2019-12-19 00:42:59
You, son. I'm in this bitch, of is the way.
@_date: 2019-12-10 14:20:25
Binance.us but if you aren't in the US, Binance is better
@_date: 2019-12-29 13:37:10
I know that's the point of BTC but who would do that now? The amount of people that actually use Bitcoin is too low for it to be a smart thing to do for a business. To accept BTC along with PayPal or whatever is a smart thing to do, but BTC alone at this point in time is not a smart thing and companies realize this
@_date: 2019-12-15 00:04:19
Hope he didn't use bucks
@_date: 2019-12-06 20:06:03
@_date: 2019-12-29 02:46:24
He has a point here. Accepting only BTC is very strange, as it limits the amount of people buying from them to a smaller group as I'm sure people don't want to figure out how to use BTC or even know what it is. It could definitely be a scam, make sure you know who you're dealing with because once you send BTC, it's gone forever and since it's not controlled by anyone you can't get a refund or anything.
