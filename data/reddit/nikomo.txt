You need Bitcoin in order to transact with Bitcoin.
The only way the vast majority of people can get Bitcoin is trading fiat for it. You're linked to fiat no matter what, because cryptocurrencies are just new currencies at the end of the day, even though they have technological advantages.
If you want Bitcoin to be usable for buying a bottle of soda, get on-chain scaling. It's already been proven that you can successfully push through changes to the network.

You just reinvented PayPal except with more fees.
Why would any user choose that out of all the available options?

If it's not on-chain, it's not going to help you longterm.

That's not the network transaction fee you're looking at, that's the exchange cut.
Creating an actual transaction on the network costs you. [Here's a website that tracks how many satoshi per byte people are offering miners to get their transactions confirmed](
For the current median transaction size of 226 bytes, the fee for creating a transaction (moving Bitcoin from wallet to another wallet, so for example moving Bitcoin from your wallet to an exchange) is 2.192 mBTC, which right now based on the Coindesk price is $33.71 USD.
If you wanted to buy a Pepsi with Bitcoin, you'd be paying what the Pepsi costs, and $33.71 for the transaction.

That doesn't account for the part where a Bitcoin transaction costs 50+ USD right now.
It'll always be coupled to fiat in that way, and it makes Bitcoin useless for daily transacting.

Off-chain requires companies to actually implement things themselves, and the consumers to worry about the details. It introduces friction into the ecosystem, which is a terrible idea in the world of tap to pay.

When you move Bitcoin between wallets.
You're not making Bitcoin transactions if you're just buying and selling on an exchange, the coins stay in their wallet the entire time.

I hate to say it but you're pretty much right about that.

Even initial prototypes have a name, all it takes is a lunch break and a really good visit to the bathroom.
You usually have like, 3 names ready after that.

You'd be exchanging a closed platform for yet another closed platform.
There's still no method of deploying an application to Windows Phone, without it going through their store, without a developer license, at least last time I checked.
But with Android, you can download the development tools for free, create an application for free, compile it into an APK, and then either install it directly, or pay the 25USD to get a developer license, and put it on the store.
We're talking about a company that refused to have an API for fucking **Bluetooth** until what, WP8? Mango sure as hell didn't have access to Bluetooth, I went to an official 2-day course when Mango was the latest version.
Not to mention, Microsoft reserves all rights to pull your application for whatever reason they like. Sure, Apple and Google have the same thing, but at least you can install applications on Android without asking Google for permission.

If the authorities view Bitcoin as a commodity, then I'll trade commodity for commodity and pay no tax.

Thanks for putting time and effort into your software, by the way.
My upload isn't enough for streaming, but I use OBS for recording my desktop shitloads.

So, you're using an outdated, unsecure operating system, and you probably have a keylogger on your system since someone got into your Dropbox.
That's entirely your fault, not Bitcoin-QT's fault.

It stopped being a "meme coin" at some point.
I'm still hazy on when that was, but I try not to think about it, and enjoy the ride instead.

No, Skype is Microsoft, which is a friend of NSA.
Not the same thing. Same end result though - why do you think Microsoft went from a decentralized peer-to-peer design, to a centralized design that costs more money to host?

The closest I've gotten to it feeling like a currency was when I bought tomatoes with it, but even then I had a middle-man in between (one of the crypto -&gt; EMV -&gt; fiat debit card companies, won't say which because nobody cares).
Even then, the shop is still getting fiat instead of crypto, it's like selling your coins for fiat except less steps, more fees, and way faster.

If the default behavior is so bad, why is the patch not included by default in upstream releases? It would be infinitely more effective if most clients ran with the patch installed, would it not? 
Also, why have you yourself inserted spam into the block chain, in the form of religious text? Surely that is bad manners, and at worst hypocritical, from someone who claims to fight spam.

There's so many branches of Christianity, it's like someone gathered all the twigs in the world and glued them together.

Buying wheels and snow chains for your fully-electric car, with a purely digital and distributed currency.
I would not have expected to say that phrase 5 years ago.

I would be willing to guess they know each other, I've had similar exchanges on Reddit with people I know.

The fact that it's a rare element with actual practical uses in electronics and other things? And it's pretty.

No, I would not.
Now, if there was an app that used the Tap and Pay in Android 4.4, that just let me tap my Nexus 7 on a payment terminal to pay in Bitcoins...

What, tattooing a QR code?
I don't see why it wouldn't work, QR codes have shitloads of error correction, so they're pretty reliable to read, only thing I can think of being an issue is contract with the skin.
Could do a test with a marker on skin and see if it reads first.

Depends on the subreddit, those kinds of jabs are OK over somewhere like but not here.

You wouldn't need to do a full back piece for it, I know I sure as hell wouldn't cover my entire back with it...
Actually, having it that big would make it a pain in the ass to scan.

Fingerprints are good as long as you use it as an additional layer.

Right, except applications are sandboxed in Android and can't touch each other.

The gold standard meant that there was actual gold, in a bank, backing the value of the money.
After the gold standard was abandoned, the only thing giving money any value was people saying it had value.
