I am a beginner too, i bought 0.2475btc, thats what i could afford, and invested it in ASICM shares. I bought mine at havelockinvestments.com, they offer frictional shares, that means 1 share on havelock represents 1/100 of a regular share. Ideal for beginners or people that just cant afford to buy a whole share for over 2 BTC. I hope i could help you a little!

Well you tipped him 200 bucks, must have been an awesome night :D

Im german, and this article got me into bitcoins: 
@_date: 2013-05-29 14:26:20
I have been verified too recently...i am still picking up the pieces of my shattered life after this has happened
@_date: 2013-05-18 12:09:45
Hopefully its not from BFL, we will never see this thing

that vine is still pretty funny

0.1 btc, thats a lot of €..
@_date: 2013-05-13 15:18:49
Thats exactly what i am doing, i am glad hearing this from others too. But i am relativly new to this bitcoin stuff and because im not so much into this security software hardware "cold storage" stuff, i created a paper wallet offline, and will store it in a bank deposit (i used the website  What do you think about that?
@_date: 2013-06-02 14:05:43
"a couple thousand BTC" lol

Help us with chest 4, i cant figure out how to take coordinates out of the sentence :/
@_date: 2013-05-29 18:07:36
this one goes crazy
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:09:59
Still..Who knows if the name is your real name, and if my bitcoin is gone, i just have a photo of you and a random reddit account, not the best swap
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:09:09
nerds speak it
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:21:56
Remember that the difficulty of mining a new block goes up as well! Doing this, the amount of blocks created stays predictable.
@_date: 2013-05-14 15:24:32
Did you deposit some btc in your account on the site? Then you fill out the box "Buy Units of ASICM"(on the site  and insert how many shares you want to buy and for what price. Then click on "Place Buy order". After that you have to wait for your order to be accepted, you will also receive an email if a tranaction takes place... 
I am not sure if its appropriate to say here how much i invested, but it isnt very much, since im a beginner too and i dont want to lose money that i cant afford to loose.
 
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:20:18
Exactly! I thinks thats a great way to buy shares, if you dont want to invest too much btc. One whole share is roughly about 1.6 btc, so with fractional shares you can adjust the exact amount of bitcoins you want to invest.
@_date: 2013-05-18 17:28:15
The easiest and one of the most secure ways to store your bitcoins, is to create a paper wallet (best if created offline) and storing your paper wallet in a safe place. You can create one eg on  . If you downoad the site (its explained there) and create it offline, you are good to go. If you created your paper wallet, make a copy of it and store it in a really safe place, eg a safe or a bank deposit. If someone would want to steal your bitcoins from this paper wallet, they would need access to the "private key" on the paper wallet, this means the thief would need physical access to the paper. Hope that helps!

how i imagine this guy : 
@_date: 2013-05-23 16:43:51
Very nice idea, but to achive this, i would have to buy me all this stuff to make my own dogtag.. I think the idea is great, if you have some friends who you can lend this stuff, so they can make their own dogtag as well..
What about laser engraving? With that, you could maybe engrave a qr code on these tags
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:04:46
Pizza-Index! Awesome!
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:18:17
On havelock you can buy "small" shares, one share on havelock represents 1/100 of a whole share. I used it, because i cant buy a whole share.

@_date: 2013-05-13 20:14:14
maybe some asci miners have been shipped...or tested or something like that
@_date: 2013-05-17 18:32:04
I think facebook already uses their serverfarms for, you know, facebook stuff. They dont have any serverpower to spare on bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-19 11:19:26
At least they arent walking back and forth on a soccer field
@_date: 2013-05-29 17:52:04
@_date: 2013-05-14 15:29:39
Nope, just as defconoi said, just send some btc to your account there and buy some shares..
I am a complete noob, but after what i heard, the price (and dividends) will be pretty good in the near future (please correct me if you know something about this stuff) :)
@_date: 2013-05-15 21:16:45
you sir, are awesome, let me just state out the obvious

Well, things like that happen, but u still got freaking 800 bitcoins
@_date: 2013-05-13 15:52:01

Wow, Hi developer! ;) I really like the design of the paper wallet, i recommend your site to everyone. I like the ziplock bag idea, but cant you also use waterproof paper in addition to security?
I really like the stickers, maybe i will buy some as soon as i have enough btc.

ok, maybe i can adjust it to tip me bitcoins, but wait im not a programmer -,-
@_date: 2013-05-13 15:38:04
But thats what scams normaly are, i mean, if i send you money, i am pretty sure i will never see it again, because i have no security or any chance to recover my money you know
@_date: 2013-05-16 14:12:32
Hit me with Your questions. Im a University Student from Germany and got into bitcoins about 3 Werks ago. A couple of days ago i decided to buy my First 0.25 btc and i already Invested this to buy some asicm shares.

Stand up for Bitcoin, good job, maybe you woke up the judges interest in bitcoin and they start mining tonight :)
@_date: 2013-05-29 18:03:42
Do the transactions go to the same address?
@_date: 2013-05-16 14:21:09
I will give it a Test sir, but it Looks Easy to understand, especially for beginners. Good work!

You are welcome! Tips appreciated! (too greedy?)

Depends on how much 1 Bitcoin is worth at the time of the release, and how much the xbox will cost...

If you are on blockchain, click on recieve money, there you should see your normal bitcoin adress, and the one that has just been added :)
@_date: 2013-05-13 15:54:31
glad i could help :)
@_date: 2013-05-23 08:01:58
Im sure you already know, but be sure to secure your bitcoins properly! Maybe store some in different paper wallets, that you created on a computer that has never been connected to the internet..and maybe store some bitcoins on a cold storage..
@_date: 2013-05-13 18:58:01
because even if its a purely digital currency, its nice to have something in your hands that represents the value :)
@_date: 2013-05-14 17:32:39
Alright i get it, but what about security for the buyer? How do you save buyers from scammers? I mean i could upload a useless file and name it something awesome, and tell the people that its awesome, then they buy it, and its crap
@_date: 2013-05-13 15:47:52
I downloaded the site and did it offline, i have a new mac, so the risk of already having some kind of malware is imho low, thats what i think and i know thats the risk i got to take. But i printed the wallet on a dumb printer without any connections to the internet and rebooted it before going back to normal..
@_date: 2013-06-05 13:37:56
And to all the haters: Please hate the game and not the player ;)
@_date: 2013-05-14 15:04:47
Im a newbie too. I bought my shares on  . It says: "Shares
Each 1 share of ASICM represents 1/100th of a share of ASICMINER maintained and verified by either Friedcat or any officially designated exchange, and has rights to 1/100th of the dividends of a whole ASICMINER share."
I thought thats good, because in this way, you dont have to invet as much btc as if you would buy a full share..
You simply fund your account on the site by sending some btc to the adress you find in "deposit btc". Then you go to  and buy the amount you want to buy. Thats how i did it..and correct me if im wrong, but i am sure now i just have to wait for the first dividends
@_date: 2013-05-16 18:46:19
Are the corners round like normal credit cards? 
Anyway, they look awesome! But how does the backside look?
@_date: 2013-05-14 16:29:30
Nice Idea, but i dont think it should be a running ticker like in the video.. Maybe more of slightly see through numbers like  (in the top right corner). Thats just much simpler to read while going eg
@_date: 2013-05-18 16:57:29
So this genius put together THIS (his own) website?
@_date: 2013-05-17 19:56:33
I am not sure if businesses would start paying wages in bitcoin, simply because the bitcoin/dollar rate is changing a lot lately (dont freak out over "a lot", but you see the value of a bitcoin changes recently)
@_date: 2013-05-16 16:20:26
Create a paper wallet, you cant plug that into the computer. Just make sure you create it in a safe (offline) environment. Make a copy of your paper wallet and store it in a safe place, away from thiefs and your gf. I made my paper wallet at  , i really like the design, and they also hide the private key under a layer of paper. Hope that helps!
@_date: 2013-05-26 19:13:42
this might be photoshopped, im not sure

About what problems are you talking? im not trying to be a dick, im just curious
@_date: 2013-05-22 19:59:45
Even if, i would suggest you start with a lower amount of Bitcoins, 0.11 is a little to much (IMHO)

Dont freak out over your security, unless you are handling huge sums... my advice is: 
@_date: 2013-06-02 11:17:45
@_date: 2013-05-21 11:16:45
I would start my own cryptocurrency, with blackjack and hockers, probably the Snu-Snu Coin.
@_date: 2013-05-17 19:05:27
Seems legit!

49$ for a paper wallet on a plastic card with fees?
@_date: 2013-05-16 16:49:18
Great tune, but to be music for bitcoin it has to have the sound of eg climpering coins or so ;)
@_date: 2013-05-14 15:27:58
How do you do that on eg. havelockinvestments?
@_date: 2013-05-20 14:58:07
But not for 0.01 btc, sorry
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:16:05
maybe people who dont understand the hardleft121-tipping-algorithm on which he decides who he should tip..?
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:24:02
i will go to bed, the chances of winning are in my opinion really low for such a newbie like me
@_date: 2013-05-13 16:55:46
I say yes, i did this and what you decribe is what happened since then. Even past transactions have been added.
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:37:36
Try havelockinvestments.com , they offer frictional shares..if ou got bitcoins tough
@_date: 2013-05-20 11:36:12
@_date: 2013-05-16 16:25:13
Maybe a lot of panic transactions? Increasing the transaction rate?
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:19:09
Get a paper wallet, ultimate security if you create it offline and in a safe environment, put the paper wallet in a safe and you are pretty good to go. You can create a paper wallet on  for example. There are more steps for "ultimate" security.
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:54:05
Or buy at havelockinvestments.com, they sell 1/100 of a whole share, if you dont want to invest that much
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:16:49
Ok, i give up, i got up to chest 4. it was still fun! Very nice Idea! And i am even a little proud that i made it that far, english isnt even my first language

Great idea, but if i upload eg a hot pic, or a song i like, that wouldnt be allowed right (licenses etc)?

not trying to be a dick, but real friends would just pay your meal and wouldnt even ask about you paying back, you would just pay their meal next time..

You could try one of the various faucets, but you wont get much out of it
@_date: 2013-05-19 19:00:45
Very nice idea! 
@_date: 2013-05-22 18:25:23
TL;DR maybe? ;)
@_date: 2013-05-20 11:44:28
Pobably not, even if you electricity is free,if you mine on your regular pc, you have to remeber it is 24/7 (or 31 ;) ) on nearly 100%, this will shorten the life of your components radically
