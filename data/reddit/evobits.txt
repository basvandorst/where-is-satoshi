I understand where you come from but that's the thing, I don't worry a bit. Here's why, I'd rather be disappointed and angry if Bitcoin falls but I invested rather than to see it rise and I missed the train, I'd be more frustrated and angry on myself if that happened. 
From my personal situation, those 10-20% I invest per month won't hurt me in any way. I support myself and I don't have kids so it's not like my priorities are f**ed up. You're probably right, it is gamble, but I always invest % in to something because some things pay off, some don't, it's how it goes. 
Bitcoin is different for me because I also actually use it to purchase stuff (as mentioned in original post), so it's not like I'm saving 100% of what I purchase.
Thanks anyway, appreciate your opinion!

Yup, I'm really happy that I finally shared my "opinion" and actions I take with Bitcoin, thanks for commenting mate!

Yeah I wasn't an early bird too but it's definitely better late than never. Best part of it is that I love Bitcoin as technology, I don't care if price falls down to $100 or bellow. Specific portion of my revenue goes towards Bitcoin, weather I can buy 0.5 or 5 bitcoins with that % I don't care. 
People are scared of unknown in my opinion, we're literally the 1st generation to deal with "money" of this kind. 
Also a lot of people connect internet and "virtual" with scams which kinda makes them think it's all "not real"... and they don't understand how Bitcoin works. 
They might understand when you tell them that there is no central bank or middle man but they still can't visualize HOW EXACTLY it works.
Thanks for your comment!

I'm fairly optimistic for Bitcoin even though I'm mostly pessimistic person. 2014 was a good year for Bitcoin in my opinion, hey we got Microsoft to accept it guys! That's definitely not a small achievement. I'm grateful to be part of this really revolutionizing technology and invest in it every month. Definitely Money 2.0 IMO!
