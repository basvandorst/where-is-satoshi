So, how do I get my coins out if their hands? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:49:33
Is coinbase still not a great place to keep your btc? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:47:39
is one better than the other?

john shouldn't be using his phone in the car like that.

"Police then proceeded to slice off the piece of skin containing the code, claiming it was a trigger to awaken a terrorist sleeper cell" 
@_date: 2015-12-04 12:00:41
Good. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 17:02:53
we should take all the unhinged, unfit to work with the public cops and put them into a special unit to seek out corruption. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:36:45
so, to you, what is the damning proof that this is the guy and goodman's journalism is apt?
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:00:03
so take her word over his? why, numbskull?
and what does it matter who satoshi is? if it's this guy. if it's someone else. or a group of people. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:09:54
To the sweat drip down my balls! 
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:40:47
at this point, i don't think it matters. i'm failing to see why it matters anymore. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:14:21
well, if her evidence in identifying this man is so concrete, i'm sure the lawsuit he is seemingly mounting will be throw right out of court and it could only validate her work. good for her then. and good for you too, i guess.
if she had this guy, dead to rights identified, why would he deny it? to stay low profile or avoid govt eyes, maybe. but how could he deny it if she truly had him?
@_date: 2014-11-22 17:34:42
Pick your wallet sounds like pick pocketing 
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:00:13
oh. was it full price or discounted?
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:23:22
when was starbound in a bundle?!?!?!!?
i've been looking into that game. argh!
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:07:14
The factors used to out this guy as Satoshi seem like they could apply to a greater range of individuals, let alone one specific person. 
Validation does not come from barely stitched together proof. Again, what she brought was good enough for you and some but not good enough for me and others. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 11:01:28
Wasn't there a Bitcoin contact out on him when all this first went down? 
@_date: 2014-03-25 09:16:47
Did you then ask them how to tame a horse? 
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:28:58
wouldn't you be able to do that with two steam accounts?
also, how are you liking the game? i'm hearing mixed reviews. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 13:30:16
What if you have a miniscule amount of coin? What if the price was actually down from when I bought it? Can I count that as a loss? 
@_date: 2014-03-27 10:01:27
How can they know how much coin you have, if any? 
@_date: 2014-03-18 20:13:58
from this guys statement is sounds like he either doesn't know what bitcoin is or he really doesn't want the blame/credit for this. from what i've read, it just seems like the latter is more likely. the factors attaching him to the currencies creations are very weak. 
but lets say it is him. why do you think he would deny it to such an extent?
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:01:14
ah, okay. that makes sense. 
i got bored of terraria, so this game seems like it would be familiar but different enough to keep me interested. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 06:09:49
i think it would be more interesting if i could ring up my Amazon purchases at best buy, but still have Amazon mail them to my house. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 07:30:02
Maybe take a few journalism or ethics classes instead of night shooting? 
@_date: 2014-03-05 13:16:01
Sensationalist title! That's just TODAY! You're cherry picking time frames to support your statement! 
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:52:00
How have you become so personally invested in this? 
It just seems like the almost provable is enough for you. I require more proof. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:10:35
I wonder if he'll ask Newsweek for his settlement to be paid in "bitcom"
@_date: 2015-01-30 18:20:49
I'd still much rather just hand them paper and leave my device out of any police interactions. 
I mean, unless they really want dick pics. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 11:38:47
This is a terrible idea. I don't want to willfully hand over my phone to a cop. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:32:51
Yes and no. The shows take their own liberties. Combining characters, changing story arcs, etc. The shows are now beyond the books though. So, these spoilers could potentially spoil the books but the show will do that in its own way. 
When the last two books come out, i imagine they'll end similar to the show but the way it gets to that ending will be different. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:37:44
HBO should just reply, "lol. do it. Idgaf."
It's scripts for a TV show that at most will ruffle fans feathers if they stumble across the info online. And the internet is flooded with Arya is dead, Jamie is Azur Ahai (sp) stuff anyway. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 23:46:12
I need to get of coinbase... 
@_date: 2016-09-23 15:52:30
Where should I move my btc to if I have them in coinbase? 
@_date: 2016-09-23 17:46:43
I'm not. Bought in during the initial reddit rush and it's just been sitting there. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 15:58:51
I'll have to set that up and send my Coins over. Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:55:18
I'd like to see a sub that just post memes based in the current btc. 
@_date: 2015-09-25 20:30:26
No wonder. They're beating the wrong body part.

You know, in the other video where they show the one sticker flaking off, i thought "That must be the "new guy" NSA agent and they'll show him how to slip it out the other end later."

you've either never had to clean puke out of a car or you're just an idiot.
@_date: 2015-02-16 21:03:26
they can and do affect peoples allergies. the puke, on top of bed bugs, lost items and ensured maintenance and all their subsequent fixes, i'd still want my own car. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:24:56
great. next weekend you can DD for everyone at a party i'm going to. i'll let them know your car is open game for whatever and we'll chip in for someone to clean it sunday. you're commute next week is going to be incredible!
@_date: 2015-02-16 15:53:08
No thanks. I'll own my own car. I've heard about an Uber like self driving car system. You'd pay a monthly fee and a random vehicle would pick you up and drop you off.
I don't want my monday morning car ride to be in a vehicle that was used to bring a bunch of puking drunks home the weekend before. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 10:40:07
This is probably the most alienating thing about the community. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:29:39
i'm glad to hear this. another user linked me to a site putting them on blast with images and such. just bugged me out. 
so the ammount of BTC, the fee and price are all locked in from that purchase date, right?
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:40:59
holding sweat, sir. thank you. bummed i missed out on this event though
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:58:22
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:22:05
Alright. So again, you have no fucking idea what you're blathering on about. That's perfectly clear. 
I'll break it down for you. depending on the amount and what was in the person or people who puked, it's not just a bit of elbow grease and all's well. it can be a long, timely process to remove the smell. 
puke removal, getting into the contours of the car and between seats. blotting what's soaked in, shampooing what you can't blot out. and if it's in the winter? frozen vomit ice scraping. 
and will the car know it's dirty or will this rely on other passengers to report it? cause i think most people trying to get home after a night out would 1. not care that the cab stinks, they just want to get home. 2. would possibly treat the car poorly because it's in such a bad shape. and 3. blaming the company for sending them a dirty car, would not report the car is in need of cleaning.
cars that get the saturday night treatment may be off the road for a few days. and in that respect a fleet of auto cars would be like if someone puked in a taxi. some drivers would not return to work until the cab was fully cleaned and others would just febreeze it and take their next fare.
and now if the cab is cleaned, will those cleaning agents trigger peoples allergies?
its fun to think about having a car just pull up to where i'm at, take me where i want to go, drop me off and continue to the next fare. but not everyone is going to be respectful or as clean as i am during my mass transit commute to work each day. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:51:48
Will the time it takes to convert become less in the future? 
I could see myself planning a purchase, converting to BTC and then making the transaction. But It would have to be 1-3 days tops. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:26:19
so what would be the hold up on this pending transaction? bank on my end?
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:27:38
i'm happy to hear this, if i actually just gave the real site my info.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:16:45
Can I cancel the transaction? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:34:04
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:18:40
In just pm'd you all those jargon lines and the public imgur image is the bar code scanner square. I included my ss# and mothers maiden name just to move things along as you help me set this up. Thanks 
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:56:27
thank you
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:18:18
money in, money out sort of deal?
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:16:25
interesting. i have much to read up on.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:41:26
i'm an android user, is there a certain app that would work best with coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:56:04
would it be in the interest of a smoother transaction to talk to my bank today? or is that a bit overzealous? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:53:34
thank you. i'll look into it. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 09:23:22
Yeah. OP is right. The climate comes of as a bunch of Patrick Bateman, captains of finance wannabes. 
"Oh, you're having trouble with something I had trouble with before?  Maybe Bitcoin isn't for you... "
" I happened to have run very successful cities in Sim City 2-4. So I think I know what I'm saying when I'm talking down to you like this."
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:35:48
i just made a blockchain.info wallet. 
when the BTC is saved on my drive, do i then load it up online to spend it? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:32:30
great.
