There are a lot of laws on the books in various nations where this would be breaking the law.  Routing messages through proxy gateways for the purpose of masquerading the source address is quite frowned upon.
Have you heard of xmpp? It's much better for messaging than sms, and making an anon xmpp account is about the same as making an anon email account.

Upvoted for your good questions.  
If I was Coinbase I wouldn't answer since you're asking them how they would enable you to circumvent laws (even if those laws don't currently exist).  
My opinion is that prohibition of alcohol was a complete failure, prohibition of cannabis was a complete failure, and prohibition of bitcoin would be a complete failure.  .... and I'm hoping that CoinBase has some servers on an island nation somewhere.

I would start removing and rebuilding all systems that might have been compromised... or at minimum stop using those devices now.  Start changing your passwords.  It is possible that some app you have installed either brought with it a key logger or a network capture tool to gain access to your stuff.
Had the bitcoins been there for a while or had they all been put into that wallet recently for your purchase?  Could someone have been watching and waiting until you got the coins together in that wallet or did they grab them as soon as they found them?  Who knew the bitcoins were in that wallet?  People that knew that there was that much money in that wallet should be the first suspects imo.

Iran Contra absolutely was money laundering.  Weapons went to the Contra's in exchange for cocaine that was flown in to homestead air force base to be sold on the streets during the cocaine explosion of the 80s.  You think the drug money was reported to congress?  No, it was laundered to fund more illegal black ops.

Not exactly.  The internet itself is not as resilient as you make it sound.  Everyone has a vested interest in the internet so problems are resolved constantly through active human efforts (IT staff).  If people weren't actively maintaining the infrastructure it would not last that long at all.

Mainstream adoption will require more than a guide.  In the end, most users want a black box that performs a function.  They don't want to know how the function is performed, or what the system requirements are, or what the configuration options are, they just simply want the function that the device is supposed to perform.  
People like us exist that can put an OS and a Pi and then turn it into an Onion Pi, or a bitcoin wallet, or a media pc.  Yes I agree with you, this is *relatively* easy (much easier, than say getting an email server talking on the internet with valid DMARC records), and Yes a guide would help some people out there (I'd go through it if I got a copy)... but no this isn't a mainstream solution.

It won't be reliable because as you ramp up your service and do more spoofing the ISPs your messages are trying to reach will begin to block your spoofing.

This makes a lot of sense to me.  The more stores that accept bitcoin and then immediately convert it to another currency, that would lead to more coins being available for purchase on the market and therefore a lower valuation.

Right... things were compromised,  from an unknown attack vector.  First things first is to reset passwords and reload systems with known good binaries to regain control while the attack vector is determined.   
That or at min the systems have to be isolated from the network to be analyzed.  Someone got in somehow, the first priority should be to lock everything down to ensure no further data leakage.  This is standard operating procedures for dealing with a security incident. 
As far as determining where the funds went, I'd keep an eye on the wallets that received the funds to try to figure out who they are...but I doubt that will be a simple task if they were good enough to do what they did they will likely obfuscate the money trail with a lot of wallets moving funds around for a while before using the bitcoins.

I expect a bumpy and scary ride, but one we can survive, thanks to having alternate value transmissions and storage systems.  
This article reminds me of the 1920's when banks convinced people to deposit their gold in exchange for bank IOU notes.  When those notes collapsed due to over leveraging the people wanted their gold back, but the banks said no.  Luckily we've learned from the past and created (and continue to create) new alternate systems to turn to when the central bank model finally breathes it's last breath.
