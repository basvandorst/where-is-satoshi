How are such low fees possible?

Um no.. WTF? 
@_date: 2014-08-04 09:37:55
Seriously though. . Is the Internet a series of tubes?

I see no problem here.  You balanced the risk of bitcoin with a great run and massive profit, paying off debt, keeping some in to ride, and knowing that you are free rolling right now.  Cheers to you sir!

I'm 37 but it's confusing. Just today I've heard if your HD crashed you lose everything, and others say not at all. 
That's a scary proposition

Thank you,. Sounds good. I've keeping my wallet on my pc with proper back ups is the most secure.

Awesome thanks. Even for someone tech savvy grasping everything about bitcoin (from mining to verifying to management) as an "end user" is overwhelming. I wish I wasn't a broke college student when it was $8 a share lol
I plan on moving and keeping a significant amount for personal and business transactions so this needed to be a certainty. I'm assuming, since you write it down, you can also backup to an external HD, usb drive, another HD, etc.
I only made an account on Coinbase, linked my bank account and made a small purchase. I am assuming this is a good "wallet"? 
My issue is this. I've read there are withdrawal limits and if you have more to move you need to use an exchange? Is that different because I'm selling the coins back to the market instead of cashing out and putting them back into circulation? 
Thanks in advance for your help

The cash out limits though

Thanks!

So while cashing out your 10k a day, if BTC tanked for some reason, you'd be screwed?

In reading on BTC I always wondered about these multi millionaires because once I made my own wallet, I realized it would take ages to withdrawal that amount anyway.

True, but thanks for your advice

You forgot the Pirate's Booty! and the 608s? (not a shoe guy) 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:00:14
I'm more excited by the prospect of eating the Pirate's Booty.
I can smell that shit from 500yds...Cant hide it from me!
