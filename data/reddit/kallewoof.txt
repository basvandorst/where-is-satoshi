You can do it fairly easily on regtest. I believe there are some tests in the testing framework (`test/functional/`) using Python which do this.
A lib I wrote lets you do this too (the demo gif actually does this so you can look at it to see how it works, if nothing else):

Sorry for late response. I think there will be tx relay services for each fork, so you should be able to do this with only one bitcoin node running. You do need that one though as you need to create the transaction, though it may be possible to pull off with existing light wallet software.
There are no other risks, no. Worst case your tx gets mined on bitcoin side and you get to start over but with a minimal fee it shouldn't be a big deal if that happened. (People are working on a tool to automate this, btw.)

Without replay protection, as soon as you want to send coins from a paper wallet, someone (the receiver, for example) could copy your transaction and put it on the other chain. If you intend to send 1 S2X, you end up sending 1 BTC and 1 S2X.

A bit late, but hey. This might help, if you're confident in your CLI skills:

1. There are pros and cons with using an exchange: if the exchange states it will support both kinds, and if you trust the exchange, you may put coins in for the specific purpose of dumping one side after the fork and you receive both kinds. The con is that the exchange may change its mind, or it may go bankrupt moments after the fork, and you may never see your coins again, etc.
2. If you use Bitcoin Core, you want to use 0.15.x as it will keep you on the bitcoin network after the split. If you use some other wallet, make sure they support what you support (e.g. if the wallet claims it is "Segwit2x only", and you want to stay on the Bitcoin chain, ***SWITCH WALLETS!***)
3. Depends. If you have coins in an exchange, the exchange may choose to ignore one side (Coinbase, for instance, may do this and only give you Segwit2x coins). If you have them in a hardware wallet, you will get both kinds as soon as the hardware wallet developers update the software to support both kinds. If you have them in a web wallet, you should move them to a software wallet and consider getting a hardware wallet asap, if the amount justifies it. (A software wallet will also give you both kinds, but having any substantial amounts in a software wallet can be a risk.)
4. No, the original BTC are not lost unless you keep your coins in an exchange that will not support Bitcoin.
5. I'm not sure what you mean by "upgraded" - segwit2x is a new altcoin, that is going to attempt to take over the name "Bitcoin". Exchanges and businesses may temporarily *call* it Bitcoin, even. It'll be confusing times. The original Bitcoin will not die out, but its price may drop substantially until the dust settles, especially if a lot of miners switch to Segwit2x as this would mean Bitcoin is temporarily slowed down.
1. I believe forks is a new trend that will continue until it becomes unwieldly. I hope I'm wrong but miners with excess hashpower have found a way to get subsidy every 10 * fork minutes. Bcash still being alive is a testament that the market acts in favor of continuing to do this.
2. I intend to sell my Segwit2x coins as soon as I am able.

Not for the weak of heart (or weak of CLI fu), I admit...

Yeah, it's not as simple as that. I've written about it here:
