Capital Markets e.g. CME categorizes Bitcoin as a commodity not a currency - but in the end it is just a definition and feel free to change the word. In general you agree? Will Bitcoin see new ATH in 2018?

You are right. What is the intention of the law (insider trading)? It is rather a question of ethics. Therefore it is insider trading.
Isn‘t the lack of fairness in fiat, inefficient regulation, and wrong monetary politics the reason why people are in Bitcoin?

In general all cryptos go up or down in parallel. Some weird Roger Ver moves influence prices between cryptos. Nevertheless Fiat to Crypto or vice versa makes the party. There are plenty of experts, who see the bubble burst. I would recommend to buy this dip right now!

There are no Credit Valuation Adjustments  but regulation will be the next logical step. That will reduce volatility. Weird Roger Ver moves seem to be the fundamental reason. Credit Value Adjustments is the mathematical explanation.

Market Cap is related to daily turnover. I agree that the daily turnover makes the price. But a coin having a market cap of 100 USD and a 10% daily turnover is obviously less stable than a 10 million market cap coin with a 1% daily turnover. For Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether, and Bitcoin Cash there are derivatives. The rest is a shitcoin or simply not mature, because relevant market cap is missing. Or it might be the ‚the next big thing‘...
Market Cap matters. And it is definitely a parameter to estimate VALUE (not only price).
Price and market cap is always related to a reference system - what is yours? USD, EUR, Bitcoin, Shitcoin?

Yes, there is unlimited risk. Usually you get a so called ‚margin call’ in case your margin is gone. i.e. you should put in more margin or close your position.

Chicago Mercandile Exchange - the biggest capital markets exchange! GDAX etc. are just doing the spot market. CME will do futures on Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:25:03
A future can be long or short. Actually it is easier to understand than an option. But usually you have to post a Margin i.e. a certain amount of money, which will be taken in case your bet on long/short was wrong. Contract size and Margin is dependent from the exchange you choose.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:41:07
You invest only a small amount (the margin), but you get a higher return if your bet is right.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:54:14
No, it is not possible to short in this way. Only using fiat will not help to bring down the value. You would have to build up a certain stake of the underlying first i.e. you need to buy a large amount of bitcoin, before you short via a future. Otherwise there is no incentive and you loose only. You would have to short the future first and then you watch your counterparts hedging by selling bitcoin and then you sell off all your underlying bitcoins to make a profit out of the futures. This is called front running and is illegal. I used to work for a capital markets derivatives exchange. Actually I suppose this is the reason why bitcoin soars with this tremendous speed at the moment. Anyway, I started to calculate haircuts starting from August 1st on the most liquid cryptos. Currently I am not updating or to be precise I am not publishing on  any haircuts. It is frustrating to me how r/Bitcoin and r/btc are killing each other instead of finger pointing the real banksters. Goldman, JP Morgan etc. btw the exchange itself e.g. CME is rather the vehicle than a real threat. For many manipulations beyond front running an exchange is more a kind of watchdog. Just have a look on one of my first posts in this group about big whales...

Almost 24h later Bitcoin still holds 10k. Bid/ask spreads have been below 10k/above 10k on many exchanges. I agree the 10k barrier is rather a horoscope signal than a fundamental aspect. But it seems to work ;-)

We at  support the Core and not the Miners. We want the banks to be miners and we do not want SegWit2x. But we have to be prepared for both. This is something my coders are struggling with. They have a reason to get upset.

...sure, here is my advertising: 
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:33:43
Here’s the maths:
p = probability an honest node finds the next block
q = probability the attacker finds the next block
qz = probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behindq =...see paper of Satoshi: 
C Code:
 &lt;math.h&gt;
   double AttackerSuccessProbability(double q, int z)
   {
       double p = 1.0 - q;
       double lambda = z * (q / p);
       double sum = 1.0;
       int i, k;
       for (k = 0; k &lt;= z; k++)
       {
           double poisson = exp(-lambda);
           for (i = 1; i &lt;= k; i++)
               poisson *= lambda / i;
           sum -= poisson * (1 - pow(q / p, z - k));
               poisson *= lambda / i;}return sum; }
Satoshi says: chapter 6
The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.
...there’s no mempool explosion, just fear and people trying to jump on the Bitcoin Hype. (Follower of Satoshi’s)

Less than 0.001% own bitcoin. I agree the dollar will not crash. But there is definitely an upside of a factor 100, if you apply 0.001% in the calculation. 0.0001% and the story reads... hope I don‘t messed up the zeros. Anyway, market cap of Bitcoin is tiny compared to USD. I‘d rather say it is 1:100000000... you need to look up  to help yourself. Then 1.000.000 USD is not enough for 1 Bitcoin. Of course the number of transactions is different. Pay USD and HODL Bitcoin!

I by heart agree. But how do you want to explain P2P to the new kids on the block? And I like the analogy of bitcoin = gold and SegWit = coins of the imperators.

The XVA-Coin is a kind of interest rate of Bitcoin. But we will not start this shitty altcoin before bitcoin market cap will be above 100 billion. I suppose this might happen in December after the bitcoin cash fork. In general, I like this bis.org chart. Have you ever considered to show derivatives besides bonds and stocks? That money is not mentioned within the calculations here in the comments - huge reason to HODL
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:03:05
The bitcoin community should be the watchdog. We need transparency regarding the inflows and outflows of big money. Market cap of bitcoin is approx. 60 billion at the moment. I plan to start a clearinghouse at  Here we want to disclose FX haircuts. I agree a common watchdog i.e. a committee of central banks or ordinary people wearing suits are not needed. At some stage an OIS discounting of Bitcoin will emerge. The interest rate in USD or EUR is close to zero at the moment. Interest rate parity tells us Bitcoin is going to rise, as soon as interest is coming back to the USA or Europe. China's OIS is far above zero. Guess why Bitcoin it is banned?

See  and many more. There is data available on OTC markets. But only financial institutions have mandatory reporting. Therefore the premium can be estimated with face value and data available, if only banks will trade with each other. My word for this is “disruptive regulation”. And it is not just “face value” and sum=0. Otherwise bitcoin would be a sum=0 game as well. i.e. there is value or money stored in derivatives and in bitcoin. The collapse of Lehman Brothers did not have any effect, if it would be a sum=0 game.

The issue is the ICO. Bitcoiners would say “fork”. There is too much malware within Ether. btw I trust only fortran or C, and C++ code. I plan to do my own shitty pre-ICO next month at  Creating virtual coins to prepare a token sale in 2018. I’d never use anything provided at github based on Ether technology. This currency is supported by Accenture, because it causes pain and creates plenty of consulting effort. Nevertheless, I am sure bitcoin and Ether will go to the moon :-) 78.987 USD = 1 ETH is possible! But bitcoin forks will perform better. Last but not least: most hacks are due to wallet hacks.

We are forced to buy and sell. Otherwise the daily turnover of Bitcoin falls and missing liquidity supports the big money manipulators. We need to buy more. We need a MiFID 2 approach.

SegWit2x is a new token, bitcoin cash was a new token (created by a fork), Ether... Market Cap of Bitcoin is still leading. Let them fork a thousand times or create new altcoins. The market will decide, which coin is worth something. You exactly hit the issue. I can exactly say what happens next week somewhere in the world. Wealth managers will get requests of their rich clients: “I want to buy bitcoin!”.
“Ether, bitcoin cash, SegWit2x, or the original bitcoin?” Guess what the answer will be. And if they trick the client and sell a fakecoin, or fedcoin, or ICO Coin. Who cares? Nobody can take away your bitcoin. Just leave your wallet or exchange, if they force you to exchange something you do not like. And the miners? They will follow their highest revenue. Bitcoin reached capitalism - it is not a nerd game anymore.

Would be pleased to be the FBI of bitcoin. �� But not (!) to investigate „citizens“ of bitcoin. Big Whales like Goldman Sachs enter the market. Would be great to see which bank or hedge fund is holding how many bitcoins. Furthermore, how many derivatives do they trade underlying bitcoin. There are many arbitrage opportunities for the “banksters” on bitcoin to steal from us �� they harm also the “hodlers”. Bitcoin could be much higher, if transparency between the exchanges i.e. bid/ask prices are aligned. High market cap comes along with liquidity - usually. On bitcoin there is an issue (or money to earn for “banksters” like NYA or whales like Goldman, JP etc.).

Hey guys, to be mathematically correct more important than bid/ask spread or overall market cap is the so called daily turnover. e.g. if it is only me selling or buying 1 bitcoin to someone else for 7.000 USD, the price is 7.000 immediately. Or 1.000. The daily turnover is published on Coinmarketcap. But your right, bid/ask spread is important as well. Usually everyone wants to buy or sell in his or her advance. Regular haircuts based on all three parameters will be published on  soon.
