pretty sure both parties can extend the time via new dual signed tx as an option.

eth has nothing to do with decentralized blockchain tech, it's the best example of bad design resulting in compete centralized unsecure mess in every way possible.
card trading been done on btc in spells of genesis for long time, and several more. after all, bitcoin invented smart contacts and scripting.

it's less secure than layer 1 but also faster, typical trade-off.

allowing people to opt-into new tech must be strange concept in the rest of primitive projects

unconfirmed tx are people who can't afford to pay market value for blockchain space and not relevant. under paying is a gamble. only ppl with zero technical background look at that.
fees are high bc market free market values it there. plenty of less secure and cheaper options, including soon layers and sidechains for btc. 
saying confirmations takes hours right after fees are high is literally lying bc they are exact opposites. I've always waited about 5 minutes bc I don't gamble and pay more than market value. 
nobody reads this censored subreddit (all of them censor and filled with memes)
it's still the most developed and most secure option by far. virtually all your talking points are based on nothing technical and have nothing to do with security - typical marketing by scams and illiterate ppl who know zero about crypto. 
if fees are too high and you want faster speeds use wow gold, paypal, or eth centralized networks as clearly security is not your concern. can also try decentralized blockchains with less security, many of those as well and perfectly valid options while btc tech advances. no other project has more scaling development and higher quality than btc, and I have tons of different higher risk and more experimental coins. it's not difficult to recognize the role btc plays, and how low tech focus on secondary things is misleading.

I think I saw something dumb about it on 4chan, some bch promotion campaign? at least it's not by centralized eth this time

there are 5+ separate teams and projects.
can track progress of some at 
there's literally no effort bigger in crypto space to scale anywhere else by many orders of magnitude
on phone so can't remember the countless links but this one is easy: lightning.network

You mean the side of how the coin was before this limit was added temporarily in its infancy until it grows a little larger.

bitcoin will not activate segwit at 95% consensus, litecoin has a shot at 75%. so litecoin will actually be ahead of bitcoin and maybe can serve as confidence boost to help bitcoin achieve it as well. maybe. I'm sure 5% will still troll.

What does this mean for WoW gold?

It wasn't wrong or right, it was nothing. Meaningless joke many enjoyed. 
I disagree. So do many others.

decentralized cloud storage is going to make pirated stuff more available than tumblr. I throw a stupid amount of money at anything that will make copyright laws unenforceable.

bitcoin didn't fail, governments allowing theists outside insane asylums failed

that's adorable. *buys some btc without id on bitsquare*
