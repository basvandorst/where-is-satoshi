Generally, people use fiat voluntarily. You and I, we're obviously coerced, but that doesn't change the fact that others use it as a unit of account and we voluntarily trade goods and services with them.

Without this there is no blockchain. Blockchain is just a data-structure, a data-structure that is useless without an associated currency to incentivize immutability. 


The internet has many layers. Some are, some aren't. 
DNS would be an ideal application, Namecoin was a fair attempt at this, Blockstack has paired this with other features. 


I can't think of one good use case, I can think of several executives at supply-chain companies that have no idea what the hell it is but like to talk a big game.
Where couriers are centralized entities, and the data on which their business is run requires them to oracalize, there is no use-case for it until they start doing business in Bitcoin rather than fiat. 
EDIT: If I stretch my imagination wide-enough I could think of multi-sig tracking numbers as a chain of custody, but that's still fairly useless in all but a few edge cases.

1) Depends on your use case. This is a personal question.
2) More channels = more possible routes. It doesn't need "the best" route, it needs a working route. It's no more problematic than their being too many roads to get where you need to go.
3) That which is used must first be allocated into a channel, this will be transparent via things like submarine swaps. The layman won't even know what a channel is.
4) See above, the layman won't even know what a channel is. The financially excluded may never have a reason to use a non-LN wallet.
5) swapping across chains is another matter altogether that is irrelevant to your prior questions.

How many cycles you've been through really shapes the perspective.

Because it is a major onramp for investment and has the potential to absorb an unprecedented amount of supply.


Fiasco? They're working fine, and IIRC we're still 6x or so higher then when they were ann'd, and those are shit fiat settled futures that have no effect on supply. The excitement around futures was mostly because it laid the groundwork for an ETF.


They're definitely two lifeforms, but competing for the food chain. An ETF would be Bitcoin encroaching on fiat territory.

A number of projects are working on this, but all phases of development has a long way to go.
The 1.0 that was thrown around months ago was just the BOLT specification, the software still is in development.
