I was really scared the first time I saw transaction costs jump to double digits and people said things like this.
A week later I was sending transactions at $1-$2 again. I doubt there will ever be a time I can't send someone 1 mBTC without losing it all to transaction fees. 
The only people who seem to believe this are the bcash crowd, and they are not exactly neutral observers.

I tried to get my brothers and parents to jump in. I bought at $2K-$4K, and talked to them about it when it hit $11K. It dropped to $9K and I told them all to jump in.
They all said it had just doubled, and they would get in when it dipped back down to $5K or so. Then it rockets to $17K, drops to $14K, I tell them all to get in. They say no way, it just doubled, they'll get in when it dips down to $10K again. 
Hello $19.5K.
Good thing is, I'm giving them all BTC for xmas. I bought everyone one mBTC when I first told them to buy in in November. Their xmas present has already doubled!

As an example I remember hearing that Exxon dragged out their payments of fines for over 25 years of legal battles. The infographic (which I can't find now) pointed out that the interest gained by delaying payment for 25 years meant they made a profit after being fined around a billion.

That's my vague plan but I'm guessing the IRS can't let people say this and claim all their bitcoin are gone. If they did none of us would ever pay a dime. 
I want to sell some but the moment I do I trigger taxes; my understanding is I have to pick an accounting method and stick with it, so I want to plan this out before committing to a mistake. I'll have to do LIFO, that way I'll never hit the original bitcoin I started buying at $250, but I can still see them auditing me and questioning all my cash transactions. 
I'm thinking of starting up on localbitcoins so I could have a cash method of cashing out: I could sell a couple coins through coinbase and pay taxes on them, but occasionally sell one for cash which wouldn't show up on the IRS radar. There has to be some big vendors who need to exchange lots of bitcoin for cash on a regular basis. I don't know what the premium is: do they charge over market or would I charge over market? Who is providing the service?
So many questions, just treading water right now.

When it went to $400 the second time (not the first big bump/crash) I was depressed. I thought I had squandered my chance, I could've bought all-in at $250, but now it is so high I can't possibly invest at the top.
Instead I kept buying bitcoin through Coinbase, but losing it on bitcoin gambling sites and the dark web. I went through my Coinbase history and realized I'd be a millionaire right now if I held instead of gambled. 
The real problem is I still have all that bitcoin as far as the IRS is concerned. They have reports of all this bitcoin I've been purchasing since it was at $250. I can't tell them the truth (they wouldn't care). Basically, even if I pay LIFO 'fair' taxes on everything from now on I'm still a huge red flag and fairly certain I'll be facing a life of audits and jail time.

That's true of both wealth and fiat, why would crypto be any different?


I hear this a lot, and it makes no sense to me. Why do you need to buy BTC in full units? If you have $300 to invest, buy that much BTC. Why care if you only get .029?


$300 is 2,900,000 satoshi. That's more than 'a few', and that's an incredibly small unit. 100 satoshi for a penny is the price today. Why not pick up a few before 'normal' people can only afford a few.
I tried buying in around $2 but my credit card flagged it as fraud. I tried again around $12 but didn't feel comfortable sending some localbitcoin user cash, and bowed out the last minute. I finally bought one at $250 and felt it was way overpriced. Just take some money you're going to waste on computer games or alcohol and buy a few and lock them away, then ignore it for 10 years.

I told my driver in India I would tip him well if he would just take me to the hotel directly instead of running up the meter.
He agreed, then still circled the city twice before demanding a large tip.
And the Uber drivers would get close enough to trigger the notification that they were there, then would actively hide from me, hoping I'd get dinged for cancellation.

Google your area for a bitcoin ATM. I don't use them because the fees are high, but they are much simpler than setting up an account on an exchange and linking your bank account. 
Besides, when it swings 100% every few months the 0.5% is no big deal.

I created an account but when I go to 'verify' it says it is unavailable, and when I go to 'deposit' it tells me to select currency from a menu, but no menu exists. I can't find any way to send bitcoin or submit a bank account. I've waited 24 hours to see if anything changes, but seems messed up so far.

I'm so screwed by this. COinbase has me buying all sorts of coins starting at $250, all of which I gambled away within days without making any capital gains.
Now that I HODL, I have no way to explain all the bitcoin I'm supposed to have but don't. I should have paid taxes on it two years ago. I have no idea how to get caught up and not get screwed by the tax man down the road.

Well ya got balls son. I have sell orders up at 7950; my thinking is whenever it breaks a milestone it'll drop back down before it climbs above it for good, so I'll sell at 7950 and buy back at 7500.
I'm guessing you thought it was going to blow through 8K and keep going? It could've happened. I remember selling at 5K expecting it to fall back, but it jumped from 4K to 6K without a bump.

Oh good lord you just ruined my day. I was planning on holding on to by BCH as a hedge, but I sold around $650 as it seemed to be failing and in a downward spiral. I had no idea it peaked at over $3K.

This is why I purchase from coinbase. Everyone says to purchase from gdax to avoid the fees, but then it takes a full week and I lose $1000 watching it go up while trying to avoid a $100 fee.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:51:41
That's my worry. I have coinbase records saying I bought plenty of bitcoin at $250. I have no record of selling them, I gambled them away on illegal gambling sites.
So as far as the IRS is concerned, I have millions in bitcoin I never paid taxes on. If I had done it correctly I would have reported nearly no gains and instant selling. I don't know if I can go back and do that now. If I try to report my selling of the bitcoin today, it'll look like I made a $9,500 taxable profit on each one.

I saw a guy on here who leveraged 20 to 1 and lost it all on the last dip. I'd never do that, but do you have a ratio you feel is safe? I'm thinking 2-1 or 3-1 would have a low enough chance of ruin.

Giftcards are popular among the identify theft crowd as being the closest to currency you can get. If you lose your wallet and find someone using your credit card chances are they are buying gift certificates.
They are probably tougher to liquidate than bitcoins, which is why you find them at a discount on localbitcoins.
Assuming the gift card you buy is legit and usable, the other problems I'd see are getting tagged by someone investigating who stole their credit cards, or police investigating other crimes who view you as having received stolen property.
I've also heard of cops setting up stings trying to confiscate bitcoin. They'll generally charge you for money laundering no matter what you do, confiscate all your stuff, then ask you to hand over your bitcoin to get out of it. Civil forfeiture laws at their best.

Nope, get it before the split and you'll have both coins. Get it after the split and you're buying one or the other.

I wanted to buy during a dip but I heard I should use Gdax to avoid the fees, so I transferred the cash to my coinbase account and a week later it arrvied so I could buy bitcoin without a fee. Of course the dip was long over so it cost me $800+ over what it was when i made the decision to buy.
This time I bought through CoinBase and locked in my price, fees and all, at $5,800. I'm happy to pay those fees, otherwise I'd be buying at $6,500 again. Those fees are the price of liquidity.

True, but please realize that to American conservatives having a private insurance company pay for private doctors to give private healthcare is socialism in their mind as long as it is a 'public option' where people are grouped together by the government.
Yes I know none of what conservatives claim is socialism is actual socialism, but when you see how low their standard is to apply that label you'd see that the Nordic Model appears to be Lenin's wet dream to them.
I'm not defending it, just saying the label for socialism applies to anything less than laissez-faire capitalism, and they actually do believe it to be that way.

I wish I could do this, or at least margin trading or something. I have all this money invested in bitcoin but I can't leverage it, borrow against it, claim it as assets, etc. 
I was excited to see companies announce margin lending; next thing I know bitfinex is telling me to cash out now cuz Americans are no longer allowed. 
Is there anywhere for an American to margin trade without having millions in assets?

I want to tell you this is a bad idea, because I can't convince myself to do it. I applied for a signature loan at a bank to buy bitcoin at $250. When they came back with an offer at 10% interest for $12K I turned it down, thinking 6%-8% was what I was what I deserved with my credit score. 
A month or two later it hit $400; I decided I had missed my chance, and now it was too late to invest. I'd wait until it dropped down under $300 then try again.
When it was under $10 I spent two days figuring out how to install a wallet. But when I tried to find bitcoin to buy, I balked at sending my money to some random guy on local bitcoins. There wasn't anyone in my state on there, so I decided I shouldn't risk it.
I also purchased an S9 miner, then cancelled the order when I read I shouldn't mine with 120V, and I didn't want the hassle of putting in 240V circuits.
You might regret it if the price falls and you spend the next six years paying it back. But if I hadn't backed out at the last minute I'd be quitting my job right now to travel as a millionaire.

I can't remember the first time I read up on Bitcoin, but I was enthralled. It think it was around the time it dropped from $30 to $2. I figured it had died and wouldn't come back, but I was desperate to get some. I remember setting up a wallet after many hours of work. I was very worried it wouldn't work if someone sent me bitcoin, as I didn't understand it at all. Then I tried to buy it online. My plan was to write down the key and hide it in my childhood hiding place in my parents basement so I would never lose it if I lost my computer, then not touch look at it for 10 years or so. I had around $10K in investments I was planning to convert to bitcoin.
My credit card company declined the purchase for fraud. I called my bank to approve the transaction, they said they wouldn't approve it under any circumstances. I didn't trust the other methods, so I gave up.
I looked into it again when it was around $12.50 and kicked myself for not trying harder the first time. This time I went through localbitcoin, but there was no one in my area selling it. I contacted one of the top rated sellers, he told me to deposit it in his bank account and send him a scan of the receipt. I didn't feel safe doing this; I didn't know that localbitcoin had an escrow-type service where I could upload the receipt and get some resolution, but I decided to try it anyways.I wanted to test it first. He wouldn't accept anything under $600, even for a test transaction. I begged him to accept $300 as a test, and told him I'd only scan it if we had issues. He insisted I needed at least $600 and I had to scan the receipt for him to deposit the bitcoin. 
Basically, I didn't buy bitcoin at $12.50 because I didn't have a scanner.

I tried everything I could think of to buy bitcoin back when it was $2-$3. My bank (Wells Fargo) denied both my credit card and debit card for fraud.
I called them to authorize the purchase and offer to take responsibility, they said under no circumstances would they let the purchase go through.
Basically, either the website offering crypto scammed customers and there were legit complaints, or crypto buyers scammed the website by buying crypto then reversing the charges. Either way, the bank was done dealing with it and blocked them for fraud.

Asking for payslips of your employer and employees...I have doubts regulations stipulate that. If other financial institutions also do this then I guess I'm wrong (I don't know Luxemburg regulations), but it seems like they are doing significantly more than what is strictly necessary.
I mean, they want a *full* list, *with* invoices, of all your clients who you've ever paid bitcoin to? Why not a sample? 
At this point, I'm worried about doing business with anyone who actually has qualified for a Bitstamp account?
