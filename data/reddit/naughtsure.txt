I hope not. Competition is needed. Customer service, like anything, can be gamed. Have you tried to contact them in multiple ways about the issue. Has the problem been escalated already?

1L2JsXHPMYuAa9ugvHGLwkdstCPUDemNCf - Looks like 1000 BTC moved a few days ago
Some went to 1FsVcdeHbpvUVT3gjeuVR2ZSDnpcsJMsLL which might be a btc-e address - 
Bitstamp and btc-e would need to confirm though, but it's an open case, so they probably can't say anything even if they wanted to.

Here's a good article that goes into detail 
"In more detail, to mine a block, you first collect the new transactions into a block. Then you hash the block to form a 256-bit block hash value. If the hash starts with enough zeros[3], the block has been successfully mined and is sent into the Bitcoin network and the hash becomes the identifier for the block. Most of the time the hash isn't successful, so you modify the block slightly and try again, over and over billions of times. About every 10 minutes someone will successfully mine a block, and the process starts over."

Definitely, but small compared to many other bank robberies\hacks. Fun to track in real time though. I think it was the guy with the white hat and backpack ;)
