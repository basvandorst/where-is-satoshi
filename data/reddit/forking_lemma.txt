Actually, that was 1971.
As the article reports, 1975 (Nakamato's reported birth year) was the year gold possession was legalized.

I'm halfway through the book. The market right now is filled with self-published garbage that will offer little more than a Google search would.
But Andreas's book is fantastic. I recently read Bitcoin for the Befuddled. That book is with reading, but Mastering Bitcoin will advance your technical knowledge in a way that no competing book can. I strongly recommend it for people that want a low-level, comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin.

Which example? Gavin Andresen had endorsed the book.

"The private ownership of gold certificates was legalized in 1964. They can be openly owned by collectors but are not redeemable in gold. **The limitation on gold ownership in the U.S. was repealed after President Gerald Ford signed a bill to "permit United States citizens to purchase, hold, sell, or otherwise deal with gold in the United States or abroad" with an act of Congress codified in Pub.L. 93–373, which went into effect December 31, 1974.** P.L. 93-373 did not repeal the Gold Repeal Joint Resolution, which made unlawful any contracts that specified payment in a fixed amount of money as gold or a fixed amount of gold. That is, contracts remained unenforceable if they used gold monetarily rather than as a commodity of trade. However, Act of Oct. 28, 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-147, § 4(c), 91 Stat. 1227, 1229 (originally codified at 31 U.S.C. § 463 note, recodified as amended at 31 U.S.C. § 5118(d)(2)) amended the 1933 Joint Resolution and made it clear that parties could again include so-called gold clauses in contracts formed after 1977."

Why is using Trezor better than a cold wallet on a PC?

Doesn't it need Internet access for its set up?

Can confirm, just quoted extensively from it for my submitted law review article.

I'll learn in a month if it's accepted for publication.  If it's not, I'll post it online (it covers last year's IRS guidance, but I also broke down the blockchain and its potential).
Just subscribed to that subreddit, too. Thanks for the heads up.
