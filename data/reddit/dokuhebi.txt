I keep hearing that once lightning is implemented, it will take pressure off the main chain.  For that to be true, there would need to be a significant migration of current transactions over to lightning.  What categories of transactions are *currently happening on chain* that would be migrated over to lightning?
(I'm not asking what new functionality would lightening enable.  I'm specifically asking how lightning is going to decrease the current use of the blockchain and free up the backlog.)

I think the important thing is disclosure.  Until bitcoin ownership is pervasive, authors of "general" publications should at least have a blurb stating "The author of this owner owns bitcoin", just like they would if they were writing an article on any other stock or security and were invested in it.
Sure, you could argue that you don't do that with fiat money, but that's not quite true.  If an author were an American and writing something about the yen while holding a significant investment in the currency, it would be unusual enough to warrant disclosure.
@_date: 2014-11-01 23:06:59
Correct.  Keep in mind that at the current price, you need to be converting fiat to bitcoin at a rate of $1.2 million per day in order to keep the price flat.  There's not currently enough demand.
It'll be interesting to see what happens when the supply rate decreases as the demand (hopefully) increases.

I understand your concern, but wouldn't most nodes be running on a system with an automatic update for the kernel? I realize that some of us may be running on a system that doesn't do so, but for the vast majority, they're automatically updating their entire stack.

So, help me out here with BIPs, compatibility, and governance.
According to the [BIP List]( [BIP310]( is in "draft", and categorized as an "Informational BIP", i.e. "This type of BIP is NOT for proposing new features and do not represent community consensus."  If BIP310 is a "general guideline", I can't see how one could be "compatible" or "incompatible" with that BIP.
Regardless, from an observer's perspective outside the mining community, if the BIP is in draft, it seems like Slush jumped the gun by requiring their miners to support it, and Bitmain has no "obligation" to follow BIP310.

I think this story is close, but if I've been following the discussions over the past year, it's slightly more complicated in how they got to Segwit city.  
Core wanted to go to Segwit city first, and then maybe go to 2x city afterwards.  There was a clear path (from Core) to get to Segwit, and the road to 2x wasn't as clear.  Miner wouldn't drive to Segwit, and Core wouldn't navigate to 2x.
So, a bunch of miners (who were also in the same predicament), got together and created a "compromise"* route (that Core didn't agree to).  The compromise was that they would drive to Segwit first, then drive to 2x soon afterwards.  Soon, Miner started the car, and made off towards Segwit.  Core was happy.
Once at Segwit, Miner starts planning the next part of the route, which was the trip to 2x.  Since Core didn't seem to have a plan to get there, nor were the other Core navigators in other cars willing to create one, Miner started working with a new navigation provider, albeit less experienced and potentially more dangerous.
Core is starting to realize that the car is going to leave without them, and if Miner leaves, it could potentially leave the vehicle lost, broken down, busted.
I agree with your conclusion that it would probably hurt bitcoin a lot, and without replay protection, Miner is not taking another car.  They're taking the only car.  This leaves Core stranded, and Miner without an experienced navigator who may not be able to make it back to Core if they get lost.
* I put "compromise" in quotes because I haven't seen any indication that Core was part of the NY agreement.

You own it in the legal sense, just like you own a car you parked in a public parking lot or money you keep in a bank account. The "you don't own it" phrasing needs to be turned down, but the reality is that if a third party has possession of your bitcoins, the value is only as safe as they're keeping the keys. 
On the flip side, if your coins are kept in keys that only you possess, they're still only as safe you're keeping those keys. 
Recommend you consider the risks that go along with every storage option and ignore anyone who says that one option is always the best option in any situation.

So, serious question... what motivates the Core developers that you're sure they'd never move over if s2x actually is successful ?  I've honestly seen no info either way, but if the current implementation of s2x is simply core plus a larger block size, then it would seem that the developers who have contributed to Core would not have much, technology-wise, from contributing all these new features within S2X.  After all, it has SegWit which we heard for years was necessary for all these new dependent features to be added.
So, I guess what I'm asking is what motivation is there for the Core developers to work on their current code base that wouldn't be there on the new project?
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:36:18
Yeah, I thought that was odd, too.

Exactly... it really upset me when I was seeing people questioning the motives of S2X, saying they wanted to "kill bitcoin".  I, too, questioned their methods, but believe that they honestly wanted to make the technology better.
I could be wrong... maybe this was a hostile takeout by the dark government.  However, until that smoking gun exists, I believe it's best to err on the side of charity.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:45:19
Don't say it was.  In fact, I'll explicitly say it wasn't.  By and large, the developers stayed out of fray from what I can see.  But, now that the crisis has been averted, I think they have an opportunity to look like gracious winners.

So, when people have been complaining that Core was not part of the NYA, is it a valid response that Core **could not be** part of the NYA since they have no vehicle to be part of an agreement outside the mailing list and GitHub?
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:12:18
How do you measure that? No one denies that s2x supporters have been actively removed from so using the voices here wouldn't be an accurate representation. The same goes for which generally doesn't like the segwit part of s2x, although voices supporting segwit are still allowed.
As I see it, if an individual did do their own research and conclude that s2x was a good thing, it seems like they'd be without a country on Reddit, and it would be difficult to measure their support. I think it's difficult to conclude the opinion of the "vast majority".
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:39:45
So, serious question.  Are there core Core devs?  If you say the Core devs who signed HKA do not speak for Core, how does Core officially speak?

We need to be careful with using terms like "cent".  "Cent" refers to legal tender, at least in the United States, and the reason (given, at least) for the Feds to go over the Liberty Dollar was their usage of the word "dollar", and the possibility that it could cause confusion.
I would steer clear of cent, dollar, euro, peso, etc... I like the idea below of decibit, centibit, etc., since there is little chance of being accused of causing confusion.

One thing I found very interesting is that at about 4:00, the film buys into the [Austrian definition of inflation]( i.e. that inflation is an increase in the money supply, and that "rising prices are merely consequences".  The Fed increases the money supply, the value of the dollar is devalued, people are therefore encouraged to spend.  It's only been recently that inflation has been redefined to refer to consumer price increases.
Anyway, I hope y'all enjoy this, and keep buying non-inflationary assets.

Greenspan's complaint is that there is nothing behind Bitcoin as a trust agent. The reason the dollar has any value at all is because of the backing of the US government  insuring its integrity. This is really no different than a bank, where you trust the bank to keep your dollars safe, even though you know in reality that the cash is flowing in and out on a daily basis. 
What Greenspan can't comprehend is that an electronic currency can exist without any trust at all. This is what gives Bitcoin value, and a value that I'm starting to think as intrinsic as the value of gold.
