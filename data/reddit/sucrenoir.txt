He only added 0.00037466 BTC

3 word seeds are ok, examples:
"code easily attack"
"try try try"
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:19:20
Yes the consolation prices are probably hidden in adresses derived from the right seed words with no password &amp; default derivation path.
@_date: 2018-05-29 08:02:01
77 is not a prime
@_date: 2018-05-23 07:22:17
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:09:09
Someone claims to have found the solution...
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:39:23
Could be:
m/49'/0'/2'/5/7	
@_date: 2018-05-22 08:08:01
Yes this one is weird 
edit: its in the whitepaper 
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:57:56
Because it's a segwit address (we think)
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:43:04
I think he means to throw away at least half of the words of the picture. He is not talking about the 243 mnemonic words of the whitepaper.
@_date: 2018-05-31 12:27:46
What about the clue : almost open ?
You should also check : m/49'/0'/2'/5/7 &amp; m/49'/0'/21'/21/21
@_date: 2018-05-22 09:00:43
Yes that's why i think it's BS :-)
@_date: 2018-05-27 07:52:44
How did it work ?
@_date: 2018-05-26 13:44:01
Lots of info here
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:43:27
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:00:50
Did you try different derivation paths?
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:38:57
I live in Belgium. Nobody use this system...
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:59:31
They are in this version of the whitepaper
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:35:07
I sell the full solution for 2 BTC !
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:45:34
Use BIP49
I would try:
m/49'/0'/0'/0/0 ...
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:35:13
What would be the price of the coin if it's market cap was equal to BTC's !
I used to have a sheet with this value calculated...
@_date: 2018-05-23 08:17:03
"k" alone appears in the C code part, but then it shouldn't be that large.
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:51:27
With a message:
I dont think he found the solution though...
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:16:49
"There are 239 BIP39 seed words in that picture."
I am confused. How many bip39 words in picture and how many in WP. Back to counting :-)
edit: Context is wrong !
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:53:26
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:43:32
Thank you for the clue ;-)
@_date: 2014-04-20 08:23:15
Same for me. I had a good experience at first with bitstamp and now it becomes really annoying because of some kyc procedure. I had to sent lots of documents, passports, proofs or earnings and the like and my money is still blocked at bitstamp. Last time i use their service.
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:13:55
I switched a year ago. I had an S3, an HTC One and now an S4. Tried many roms... I will switch back to iphone as soon as they offer a larger screen.
@_date: 2018-10-21 15:59:03
If using the same derivation path...
@_date: 2017-08-10 11:48:22
Vanitygen or Bitcoin Core
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:46:40
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:46:21
If you add a third member in the LN "pending transaction" and member 1 or 2 wants to close the LN, what does happen ? 
Could the nodes running the lightning networks be some kind of other decentralized blockchain ?
Thx for the info !
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:19:56
Very informative. Thanks
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:45:57
Because coinbase regroup transactions in large numbers and pay only one (larger) fee...
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:40:11
Does that mean a large number of new transactions due to opening new LN channels ?
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:11:06
That's what banks do... On a day basis
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:48:41
That's exact !
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:41:32
It should be better in around 5 hours.
@_date: 2018-06-01 11:15:09
You could use bip141 to generate adresses starting with 3... Thanks for the downvote
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:35:06
We cannot be sure 
@_date: 2018-06-01 10:21:53
use bip49
@_date: 2018-06-01 08:39:47
You can specify the derivation path in this tool:

A new meme is born...
@_date: 2017-09-08 07:36:12
Yes you should diversify a bit. 
I bought some dash with my BTC (2 or 3%). It has some great features.
@_date: 2018-02-19 10:18:27
I have the same problem for more than a week. Can you do something ?
@_date: 2017-09-26 09:06:33
I wonder how much time it would take with 1 sat./b.
very low fee ≠ free 
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:09:12
Money flowing from alts to btc.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:19:13
Can we be sure that the firmware running on the hardware wallet is secure ? I bought mine on amazon but i dont trust it for more than a couple of btc.
@_date: 2018-04-14 13:41:11
It's not a pump but a short squeeze
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:41:20
Are we going to reach 2017 in 2017 ?
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:36:31
Yes i was, but now i want to be able to buy at the current (relative) low price...
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:25:16
Based on my intuition, meaning nothing... :-)
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:59:11
Good to hear ! Sure, i saved some cash because of the delay, but i think it will go higher very soon. Thanks for the info :-)
