Child support can be waived by agreement if the judge is satisfied that the child’s needs are being met. Not all judges will do it, but many will, particularly if the custodial parent has a decent income. If the judge approves it, it’s not a contract, it’s a court order. It would be very difficult to sue for child support later if you agree to waive it and the judge approves it.

Nah. I’m a divorce lawyer. This stuff happens all the time. She gets her lump sum alimony payment in the marital dissolution agreement, and he gets 365 overnights in the parenting plan. As long as he doesn’t get any government assistance (food stamps, etc), he can waive child support she would otherwise owe him.

You’d be surprised.  That is a high alimony, but it’s not unheard of. The law favors parents working out the custody arrangements on their own. The law assumes the parents are guided by their own judgment and are acting in the best interest of the child. For example, in my state, it is required for parents to attempt to mediate custody issues before they can try them. The law does not want courts to make custody decisions if it can be avoided. If the judge believes that the agreement does not endanger the child, and the child’s needs will be met, most judges feel that it is not appropriate for them to insert their own opinions and judgment in agreed custody matters, even if it is whacky. 
She can’t legally leave the country with the child if the court order grants him primary custody.
