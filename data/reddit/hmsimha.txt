You'll probably just get downvoted a bunch, but I wanted to post to suggest you start reading the submissions on this subreddit, because a lot of what you said was way off. MtGox is pretty much guilty of relying on a part of the protocol that had extensive documentation describing it's unreliability. The malleability of *some parts* of the  transaction headers has been known for some time (or may have even been an intentional feature of bitcoin by its creators). MtGox fucked up, and is blaming bitcoin for it.
Also, the crash isn't just due to the sale of 3-6k bitcoins, it's due to the oldest bitcoin exchange stopping people from getting their money out altogether (in addition to the political news that affects bitcoin).
Also, bitcoin is only untraceable to a degree, but far less so than cash.

As someone who just moved to Canada, and is in the process of getting verified with CaVirtEx (which is tricky when you just moved somewhere), I do have one thing I've been dying to understand about CaVirtEx.. Why does bitcoin move for anywhere from $25-$40 CAD less than it does on other exchanges?
For example, right now the current price of bitcoin on Coinbase is [$722 (CAD) per bitcoin]( If I want to sell bitcoin on CaVirtEx, right now, it looks like I'm going to get $690 CAD for it, whereas on Vault of Satoshi I would get $723. Any idea what causes this kind of difference?

No, I have confirmed his identity. I did a skype tour of the apartment and it turns out he uses couchsurfing (which I also use). The reference system is pretty robust and it's never lead me wrong.

btc-e [has had a rule since June 2013](
I'm guessing you weren't able to access the non-ssl version via tor, but only locally (unless you're also using an outdated version of tor).
edit: June 2013 not 2012

I wasn't suggesting  it was just something interesting that I came across. From Gavin's wording it seems like he considers it a possibility that his mentioning the CIA spooked Satoshi.

And I want to read the news that *I* think is relevant. I've been around reddit long enough to know how it works. The mods create a subreddit and set the rules. The users of that sub interpret those rules to post and upvote content that is relevant to them, and downvote content they don't think is relevant or don't like. There's a downvote arrow next to my link, and I'm guessing you've already used it. From the looks of it though, there are more users who found my link relevant than irrelevant. In a sense the majority rules on reddit. What I think is relevant is just as important as what you think is relevant, so I suggest you check your attitude.

Well if it makes you feel any better, I now have you tagged as 'did bunches of stuff' in lime green in RES.
Speaking of which, since you're a developer, why not hack on RES to implement a feature that would let users link to their clout within a subreddit. Here's a suggestion on how it could work:
- RES could designate a specific color (say lime green) for users to set their own 'default' tags within a subreddit.
- Each RES user could choose whether or not they want to see default tags
- If a RES user has not opted out of seeing default tags, they would see a lime green tag for each user who has set a default tag for themselves in that subreddit (only if the RES user has not set another tag for that user).
- You could set a default tag for yourself 'Did bunches of stuff' that links to this post. (each RES tag is by default linked to the comment it is set from)
- When someone sees your username, they see a lime green tag saying 'Did bunches of stuff' and hovering your name links to this comment
- An even better feature would be if hovering actually loads the comment into the hover panel.
The thing that might make this challenging is there would need to be a way for RES to confirm a user wants to set a tag (since it would have to persist the data somewhere else and users could forge default tags for other users by forging POSTs to that datastore's API or whatever). They could make a reddit bot though and users could 'default tag' themselves by messaging the reddit bot.

they probably don't need to forge the email from btc-e, they just intercept the withdrawal request, modify the bitcoin address, and pass it on to btc-e. Btc-e sends the verification email, which OP confirms not noticing the different withdrawal address :/

Also, I don't have a checkbook. I don't like writing checks because there's no telling how long someone might take to cash it and you have to balance your account and whatnot. Bitcoin was way easier for me.

Or perhaps it evolves slowly because it doesn't rely on security through obscurity and must develop truly secure solutions.

If you read the article (now on page 2 of this sub) ['Silicon Valley VC thinks a single bitcoin will be worth $100,000']( (interestingly also by wired), this is *extremely* relevant. Even if you didn't read it, it's another example of a new revolutionary technology that businesses and people initially didn't see the importance of investing in, often to their detriment.

Hi Jon, does your Skyhook machine allow people to sell bitcoin now?
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:44:30
Yeah, but then I have to, like, mail it.
@_date: 2014-07-05 17:14:59
Oh. Ugh! That's awful. Whoever's behind this must be raking it in! I don't know if this merits a post, but the same person MITM-ing btc-e could easily be intercepting login requests to reddit and harvesting passwords... so anyone with a balance who has ever logged in through tor is at risk.

You're right that TOR forces HTTPS everywhere. I just downloaded the newest version of tor and went to btc-e to make sure it redirects to https as it's supposed to.. and it does. Would you be willing to share what version of TOR you were using? I'm looking into it right now to see if I can figure out what caused the failure to route you to the https version of the site. I'm thinking if you're using the current version of TOR, this means either HTTPS Everywhere has a bug, is compromised, or you downloaded a compromised bundle from an attacker.
You'd be doing everyone else a favor if you help us figure out what caused this. So for starters, which version of TOR were you using? The next step (assuming you were using a current version) would be to verify that your bundle didn't have an exploit baked in. Do you still have the archive binary you can verify against the [public signature]( This would be the file you originally downloaded from the tor website (assuming you did download this from the tor website)
edit: also, in the email that linked to the screencap you posted, would you view the raw source of the email and verify that the email did in fact link to btc-e directly?
edit2: hmm, so it appears that they actually sent you a confirmation that correctly linked to btc-e but with a confirmation link to the attacker's transaction.

I haven't had any problems with Bank of America. They also published an internal analysis of bitcoin where they express a lot of optimism for its future.

I was thinking about this, and it makes sense that the potential for bitcoin to be DEVASTATING to the economy of countries whose residents adopted it en masse might actually limit it's potential as a true currency. Because governments would be practically forced to move to ban conducting business with it.
So in the end, we may be stuck with bitcoin as a novelty currency or value store, but not a true currency. I'd love to hear everyone's theories on how it could actually be adopted as a popular currency though.

well that was here in portland.. I don't think they were legally forced to serve a gay couple, they just suffered too much backlash from the public that they weren't able to afford to keep their storefront open.

hahaha! I like this, though technically bitcoin can only be sent over the bitcoin network. If I sent a payment to an address shared in IRC it wouldn't be 'sending it over IRC' anymore than if I sent a paypal payment to an email address posted to that IRC channel.

Governments have already banned it (Germany, I believe).
Also, I wouldn't put anything past a governing body, especially one that's fighting for it's life.
