As a financial speculation you’re right. But as an investment in technology I completely disagree- we want it to be unregulated, we do understand the tech, and we love that nobody has done it before! People should be investing in bitcoin as an investment into tech rather than hoping to get big money casino style

This makes sense. Thanks a lot! I guess also breeders who are irresponsible will potentially ditch dogs that aren’t imperfect in their eyes too

So basically it’s the extreme measures the animals are sourced from?

I’m not saying you’re wrong but I’m also not seeing any cases where it’s clearly their fault- just a bunch of tickets where they can’t transfer due to identity validation issues and such

This is why it’s good to accept some gains! In at 6k and sold half at 17k during the week of stable boredom. No matter where it goes from here I’m netting

Hmm... how don’t you not know?

Yeah I think the phrasing of my question came out as pointed rather than curious. I am just curious because I have no researched the subject but have heard jay pet stores are bad! And correct every pet owner I know (that I’ve asked at least) has had a pet from the pet store except for two of my friends who have aggressive shelter dogs. It’s anecdotal and probably not fair, but I see where those rumors come from. I’m sure most rescues are fine and please don’t take my “what’s wrong with pet stores” question wrong- I was quite literally asking because I have no idea yet . Thanks!

I’ve always seen people regret adopting dogs because they’re timid and sometimes aggressive. But I see these comments everywhere so there must be a good reason. What’s wrong with pet stores these days?

I have two friends who had this happen! You’re right it’s anecdotal because it’s clearly not the majority based on the responses I’m getting . And they’re great parents to their dogs I can assure you that

In elementary school we learned not to talk about the bears and the bulls
