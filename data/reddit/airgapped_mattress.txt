Scarcity and saleability across space and time should be at the top of the list. Without scarcity and saleability bitcoin would have no value. 
Utility is much less important, almost irrelevant. 
You can have utility without scarcity which will lead to minimal value. You can have scarcity without utility and have extremely high value.

It has been said before that most people don't intuitively understand assets with returns &gt;100%. Bitcoin is up 250% in 3 months and people freak out about a 10% drop. It's exactly like freaking out about a $4k to $3.6k dip in March - is that relevant now?
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:07:10
It's amazing your $0.03 transaction fee can get you so much security for your bitcoin.

No, interest rates are going to be below zero until the whole house of cards burns down and bitcoin takes over. Look at Japan, look at Europe, negative rates, they have 12 trillion of negative yielding bonds outstanding and growing. US is heading there too.

You don't need utility. You only need saleability across time and space (in addition to scarcity).
Imagine something scarce with utility but no saleability across time, ie truffles. They are scarce, they have utility (you can eat them) but they perish (not saleable across time). Hence they wouldn't make good money. 
Utility is completely unnecessary.

It's not possible for BTC to collapse at this point. So much energy has been expended on mining that work cannot suddenly become worthless.

This guy!!! ��
@_date: 2019-07-28 19:33:07
Yes, cumulative energy spent so far gives bitcoin value. It's what secures the ledger - if someone wanted to overwrite or censor an old transaction they would have to expend more energy than the cumulative energy expended since. That's what makes bitcoin valuable.

What people are missing here is that regardless of the transaction price on the fee market, the large hodlers will voluntarily pay miners to secure the network if needed. They will have a lot of skin in the game and will happily donate 0.1% per year for security. If the other option is 100% loss guess what they'll do?

This issue was known in Congress when the cap gains tax was passed. In the 1970s there were efforts to index cap gains to CPI to avoid 'taxing inflation' as you say, but since tax calculations were done by hand at the time it was deemed too complex and infeasible. It would certainly be worth revisiting again now when Turbotax can do it for us.

Fed has been trying to raise rates but they can't or the entire house of cards would come crashing down. They raised 4 times last year and now they will be CUTTING twice this year just to keep the economy above water.

Just as Jamie Dimon said, bitcoin is the most volatile asset in the history of mankind. We have never seen anything so volatile before. Why? Because bitcoin has the highest expected return of all assets that have ever existed. Bitcoin's Sharpe ratio (risk adjusted return) is comparable to stocks, but because its return is an order of magnitude greater than stocks, it's volatility also has to be an order of magnitude greater. I agree, it's a feature, not a bug.

Let me put it this way: BTC has a 85% expected annual return with a risk comparable to stocks (Sharpe ratio \~0.4). If you can find a better risk-adjusted return elsewhere and have access to cheap dollars then lever up and buy stocks or bonds or whatnot. If you are like most people you'll have a hard time finding anything with a higher expected return.

Consumer goods inflation has been low, as you say, due to compressing margins (for a brick-and-mortar shop cost of goods has to be 50% of sales price to stay in business, but amazon can have 80% cost of goods and be able to cover costs) and globalization (cost of labor arbitrage). However, price inflation in pretty much evey other category runs 5-6% per annum, that includes energy, land, college tuition, aggregate tax receipts, etc. The main reason governments are keeping rates low is to keep interest payments on existing debt manageable. As government debt vs GDP increases rates have to drop to compensate. That causes misallocation of capital and a widening wealth gap between the rich (who benefit from low rates and asset price inflation) and the poor (who lose).

Sync time is important for decentralization. If you can't bootstrap a hobbyist node because the blockchain is growing faster than you can sync it you no longer have a decentralized network. The other issue is censorship resistance: 1MB blocks per 10min is small enough you can broadcast it over long-wave radio using GPRS if the network is censored on the public internet. 100MB per 10min you can't send over long-wave radio.

I look at sentiment and price floor based on adoption. I like to buy when sentiment is down, most bitcoin is in the hands of hodlers, and speculators have all left. If you buy at those times you can't lose money because there is nobody left to dump on you. Those times were December - last week and mid-2015 to end of 2016. You can buy now and make money if you hold long enough (till end of this year) but when there is fomo there are by definition people who might dump on you. If the price drops back to 4300 I'd be buying for sure because you can't lose.

Most people worry about the opposite problem - too much demand and astronomical fees on L1, so much so that they forked bitcoin into b-cash. You worry about the opposite - no demand for L1 and no fees. The reality will be somewhere in the middle and miners will be just fine.

Assuming US, and assuming you don't hold btc in a IRA, you will pay long term capital gains tax on the $41,500.

Why would you sell at $7000? Or $10000? Doesn't make sense to me. If that's your strategy you will lose your money, sorry.

Bitcoin core fee estimator is broken. It's what most wallets and exchanges use to set fees

50x leverage on bitmex gives you more than one bitcoin worth with your $300.

I am going to disagree. A mortgage rate is 3-5%, bitcoin appreciates at 80%. Why would you ever pay down debt denominated in worthless inflating fiat? Makes no sense to me.

Unless tethers are being redeemed for USD there is zero impact on BTC price. Since tethers in circulation are actually increasing there is no downward pressure on BTC.

Look at price of bcash and the number of transactions on it. Bcash is not secure so nobody uses it, and as a result it has little to no value. Again, the debate has been settled. If you want bigger blocks just use bcash.

Max Keiser called for $100k but gave no timeline. That said I think $100k eoy 2020 is reasonable.

But it does. 100% of restaurants already accept 0conf in the form of Visa (which has a 60-90 day rbf window, aka chargeback). Their chance of dine and dash are lower with 0conf bitcoin if you ask me. But in the end dine and dash is a crime that will be prosecuted regardless of payment method, which is why it happens extremely rarely.

Uhm, bitcoin core client downloads and stores the entire ledger. Just import the address?

According to your plot October 2018 was a safe buy because the production cost ($6k) equaled the price ($6k). How did that 'safe buy' work out? People lost 50%. You are ignoring the fact that the hash rate can change rapidly.
