How ripple was originally envisioned, possibly, but I don't think that's how the current token works. Seems more like the average heavily pre-mined token.

In my mind, voting makes me an accomplice to extorting people of their property via government action. For that reason, I cannot allow myself to vote.
Disclaimer: I used to vote mostly for republicans.

Yes, it's no different than selling bitcoin. However, you can redeem that action by purchasing back what you had spent.

We can vote, but we really have no choice. We can vote for an extortionist or an extortionist. I prefer a society made up of multiple voluntary agencies of governance that compete with one another for membership.

If the national debt were to be paid off, we would run out of dollars in existence before fully paying it off. Also, as it was being paid off, the dollar would dramatically increase in value; decreasing the dollar value of hard assets, thus making the debt harder to pay off.

I use it regularly, then I buy more. I even work at a place where I can opt to get paid in it... It's not dead.
I also live in a heavily tech oriented city. Strangers I've met have not only heard of it, but are excited about it. I suspect you're living in some kind of tech bubble.

Purse.io is about the only option to buy bitcoin with credit cards, but it's at a premium price. Once you have bitcoin, you can convert some of it to litecoin through an exchange (poloniex.com).
@_date: 2015-12-13 05:21:55
If you trust coinbase to be around for a while... They have some type of "vault" service that they offer.

Likely their money is being diversified into all kinds of things, just maybe bitcoin is one of them.

I wouldn't call it inaction... In all fairness, Core has offered several solutions. Some not great; most will take too much time to properly develop and vet.

They're the government... Their authority is the potential violence they can inflict if uncompliant.

Bitcoin core is open source, it's constantly vetted by people who know what to watch out for. I believe there are other open source options as well - might not be as vetted.
As for most of your other concerns, I'd suggest getting involved in the local community. There might be a bitcoin meetup near you... A great place to go and ask questions, get advice, and maybe even find someone willing to sell.
Another option for buying bitcoin (although at a premium price of 5-20%) is purse.io. There, people post things they want from Amazon and what they're willing to pay for it with bitcoin, you buy it for them with credit card, then you receive bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-12-07 20:33:52
I've been on the fence... I'm optimistic!
@_date: 2015-12-11 10:30:29
Largely depends on where you live.
Maybe circle.com
Or hopefully there's a bitcoin atm near you.
@_date: 2015-12-25 05:01:21
The service consists of you buying items off of Amazon for people wanting to spend bitcoin. You might only get 90-95% of the cash value worth of what you buy as bitcoin.

I haven't heard this much at all since the market cap was well under 1 billion. Regardless, it's still a small economy and a small user base - no real need for large market cap yet.

No, citizens were extremely limited on the amount of withdraws they could take from banks and ATMs. Also, there was an incentive for then to keep euro cash - nothing was wrong with the euro itself, it would've still been usable even if Greece was removed from the EU.
@_date: 2015-12-24 20:36:56
That's actually the same investment strategy of the venture capitalist firm Andreessen Horowitz. The main problem though is that many of these companies have initial investment rounds, and it's sort of hard to get in on the action early enough - unless you have large amounts to invest. There's still plenty of room for the bitcoin currency to grow, and some of these companies offer their own tokens which is sort of an alternative way of speculating about their success (i.e. Factom: factoids).

One solution may be to assign the fee based on transaction size (kb) rather than flat fee. At least one other blockchain does this.

Yeah, they're fairly split on bitcoin... I came to BTC from an interest in silver. Other silverbugs are very adamant against it.

I like clean energy as well, but work within the two fields don't necessarily translate well. An oil rig worker can't go to a solar rig.
Markets rise and fall, cheaper costs of transportation may help these workers get jobs in other fields that benefit from cheaper gas prices (if gov regulations don't also chase those jobs offshore).

I think between this and advances in blockchain businesses, the only thing barring this from being a mammoth year for bitcoin is consensus.

The lottery jackpot is like $1.5 billion... Which means people spent roughly $15 billion on lottery tickets. Think if $15 billion went into bitcoin... Now think of how prevalent is the type of folks who buy lottery tickets rather than making sound financial choices. Ugh.

Sorry it's not very clear. People that are into precious metals are typically called goldbugs or silverbugs... Since this is copper, I just used the term metalbugs. A lot of these folks have with us in common is a strong belief that government money (aka fiat money) is not backed by anything and will eventually fail. BUT many of them also don't see value in bitcoin and are even hostile towards it.

"shrinking supply"... is there something more to this halvening that I don't know about?

@_date: 2015-07-24 19:50:24
I feel that the issues that caused the world-wide 2008 economic crisis have not been resolved and in fact made much much worse; that it's a ticking time bomb. The US, for one, is in no position for it to happen again. Their main tool against such things is to reduce interest rates, but interest rates are already near zero. That will leave central banks with only one more option, to buy assets (inflation). Precious metals and bitcoin can all benefit from that.

Once bitcoin has a legit foundation for side chains, perhaps factom can port over. But that doesn't exist yet.
ICOs have proven to be a great way to fund these type of projects. Otherwise, they may receive lackluster support.
@_date: 2015-07-28 16:42:12
@_date: 2016-09-25 20:44:44
It's about as close to a side chain as you're going to find yet, in any sort of eloquent manner (difference being that it can be a side chain to multiple blockchains). If you're worried about spam and bloat of bitcoin's blockchain, factom is helping divert some of that and consolidating it into one transaction per block. Factom can handle the load that bitcoin cannot.
@_date: 2016-09-25 21:04:37
Those transactions are paying their mining fee. Are you saying the anti spam mechanism is failing?
@_date: 2016-09-25 23:32:43
Both ether and factoids are currently more valuable than ICO prices. Investors have done well. How is that theft?
@_date: 2016-09-25 02:38:36
Factom acts as a side chain to bitcoin. With that, it's storing hashes and data off of the bitcoin blockchain and combining it all into one btc transaction per block. Seems more like an asset, than parasitic, to me; especially when transactions are limited.

So yes, you value them, but you need your neighbor to help pay for them... Which is the reason that you voting in favor of taxation is robbing your neighbor.
@_date: 2016-09-21 14:44:16
I think it has good potential... my only concern would be the longevity of it. Can data get corrupted or erased over time? Would it being rubbed up against a magnet destroy data? Perhaps it wouldn't be something you'd want to carry around a lot, but storing it in a small Faraday cage or something. Does it need recharged routinely to be able to store data for long periods of time?

What service does the government provide that the free market can't better provide? None. Taxes paying for socialized services rob us of quality service.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:41:35
Free market is the absence of government... It's the lack of government getting in the way. And just because someone has the ability to take someone's property doesn't mean they freely can or should. The thief still had to deal with a community of neighbors and negative reputation in doing so.
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:28:07
Your neighbor's property isn't your property, so you shouldn't have any say over it. Just like you probably wouldn't like your other neighbor forcing you to buy meteor impact insurance.
