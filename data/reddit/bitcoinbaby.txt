The only reason Bitcoin falls is because of evil attacks on it - otherwise it would be $1000 by now. So relying on evil to get your bitcoins cheap, is you and all the others supporting evil . Those days are nearing an end.

Bitcoin will end the financial rape of humanity by bankers. This action does demonstrate the point that those who control the flow of money think they own it. This false view is what makes bankers unfit for purpose, and therefore replaceable with Bitcoins.

All governments today are a DISEASE to the people they are meant to serve. Humanity cannot do anything about the abuse of government and banks and are victims to them.
Bitcoin will re-balance the situation by denying them of the food they need to control you - money. Bye bye banks/governments, your time is up.

Bitcoin will end government intrusion in our lives - goodbye governments hello bitcoin

Humanity needs to realise that government is a disease, and is detrimental to all of our health, wealth and happiness. We need to ignore them and deny them of their food, which they call tax. 
Use Bitcoins and they will be forced to serve the people, not enslave us.

PS In the UK the our tax money has just gone to increase the amount we give to the Queen. What a planet.
@_date: 2013-05-21 12:54:46
What you dont realise is that Bitcoin will create an economy outside of the existing one. In the same way there were no websites to visit in the early days of the internet, currently their are very few Bitcoin businesses. However in the future all businesses will use Bitcoin as it is the best payment mechanism on earth. The side effect of all this is that transactions and money are not subject to the policies of government and banks. So for example Bitcoin businesses of the future will not pay VAT or Tax thus denying the banks and governments the only thing they live off. Us

This is why humanity are slaves to governments. Your response is to make a personal comment about me which has no relevance to the point. Your inability to deal with truth means you cannot respond in any positive useful manner. By making a joke you think you are clever, but you are in fact being financially raped and too childish to be able to make a sensible comment on it.

Bitcoin is the first money on planet earth that cannot be confiscated by any government. It means an end to taxation (theft) and the IRS. That is one of the major benefits of Bitcoin, - its not its purpose.

Humans are the only point of failure for Bitcoin. To those who understand, converting money from Bitcoin to fiat is the equivalent of using a modem for sending data. The sooner humanity takes on Bitcoin the thought of using fiat money will evaporate.

ALL tax is THEFT. The government does not have any right to your money. They are thieves. Use Bitcoins and get rid of the government and bankers. Its very simple.

Bitcoin will bring an end to the disease of taxation. Government thieves will no longer be able to access or steal from anyone. Tax for humanity that wants it - is DEAD.
