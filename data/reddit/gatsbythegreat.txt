My man. Congrats on getting in so early.
I kick myself everyday for not knowing about Bitcoin back in college when it was 7 cents. And to make matters worse my friends knew about it at that point but thought it was a scam and didn’t think to tell me when I’m the risk taker out of the bunch and definitely would’ve invested. That’s once in a lifetime transformative wealth for people who got in that early.

Credit cards and retail stores monitor what you buy and when you buy it to the point that they can pinpoint what trimester an expecting mother is in, so they can target you more efficiently when they send advertisements and coupon mailers to your house. This is has been going on forever. Facebook wasn’t first and won’t be the last. This is tinfoil crazy person territory but I also feel like sometimes phones and TVs are listening to stuff we say because I won’t Google anything or won’t look for it online at all. I’ll just talk about it with friends and family and I’ll end up seeing the advertisement on the internet and cable later.

It’s going to happen again. Roughly there’s a recession every 10 years and a cataclysmic event every 45-90 years. It’s unavoidable in a debt based society. 2008. 2000. 1998. 1994. 1987. 1973. 1930s. 1907. We didn’t really come out of the Great Recession. Our grandparents suffered for ten years after the Great Depression and paid the cost for rampant speculation back in the 20s. Plus having two World Wars and every other world power destroyed as a result goes a long way in recovering your economy. Our generation however....the government just infused tons of cheap money into the system to stimulate a recovery but, nothing has changed. People are still indebted. The jobs aren’t there. Wages aren’t rising. Rates are extremely low and growth isn’t where it should be. The US is in extreme debt, will probably no longer be the reserve currency in another few years and future outlook is opaque at best. Banks are even larger and more dangerous than before. Except now there’s very little we can do during the next crash to fix things. As alot of people have theorized the IMF or the Bank of International Settlements will get involved in the event of the next crash, since the central banks will be overwhelmed and a new form of digital currency will replace the dollar.
