Yep i virus searched my computer yesterday and found a couple of trojan horses. This is so stupid because i got my yubikeys today that i ordered last week. I have changed every password possible and are now using yubikeys for ultimate security and NO more bitcoin business on windows. 
Whats sad is that this wallet was everything i had in bitcoin.

I guess they could register a .bit domain via the namecoin network, to prevent the the domain from being shut down.
