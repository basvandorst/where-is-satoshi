Lightning allows you to lock coins between two wallets, and then send special transactions between each wallet which only become valid when they are added to the blockchain. You know the vendor's address, the vendor knows your address.

Anyone with some programming skills can do it.

By China, do you mean Korea? Also, look at the charts. It's just what Bitcoin does :)

GDAX, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Kraken once upon a time

A number of reasons, really. If someone expects a further drop, then they can sell at $15K to buy back lower and pocket the difference for example.

add paper wallet key to a mobile wallet (like Mycelium) on a **trusted** Android device, then send your coins to a hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor)

There are dozens of exchanges out there where you could possibly buy. Not sure where you're from but you might want to check out Bitfinex, Bittrex, Cryptopia etc. Give Localbitcoins a try as well, maybe someone sells locally for something closer to the actual parket price.

Bitfinex would have been my first choice as well. Also, I would be reluctant to put my money on any exchange without verifying an account first.

Yeah, that's how I'd go about it, factory reset, don't install any apps apart from the wallet and you should be good to go!

LMAO, I guess I should have seen this coming. Then it's programming skills OR 0.01 BTC :D

It most certainly was not. These people either didn't read the whitepaper or they're simply lying.

Depends on the fee really, you can check one of the fee calculators available online. There are ~161K unconfirmed transactions right now, we've seen much worse.
