I assume that the trials would stop if a match is found, otherwise it's useless.

What would be the best aproach for blockchain download on the pi? Using another machine then moving it on the pi?

Is bitcoin doomed when these go mainstream? I assume the tech is not so far away...maybe 5\-10 years.

I would be interested in a clearer explanation as well...that page is confusing as hell.

If I were to tax anything, it would be ICOs on the receiving side, with a large amount, maybe 10%.

They used github to host the malware? Why would you do that?
