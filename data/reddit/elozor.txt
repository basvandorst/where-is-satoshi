hah, good point, this can def be used as pump for bcash or any altcoin like litecoin or something similar. maybe even an attack for a new bcash like coin. i think this is very healthy for btc in the long run as it proves it withstands anything ppl throw at it

so, 1 address with 10 btc or 10 with 1 btc same security? or hypothetically its more secure but at this point they both so unfathomably out of reach that its the same thing pretty much .  
would you suggest to consolidate transactions to 1 address and 1 transaction?
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:13:12
wow, what a crazy read.
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:24:35
i found the link, here you can see there is a project that brute forces random keys and found keys with btc on it. read this up 
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:56:40
brute forces is the wrong wording, but its similar to just looking for random addresses untill you find one with btc on it. but you look through so many so fast so in my mind it was brute force. ofc u not trying to crack a specific address. you just randomly creating new ones really fast just to see if you can make one that already had btc sent to it. and then my question comes in play if its safer to split btc in several addresses not to get collided. the chances prolly are so small. like getting hit by lightning 1000 times and surviving every time. vs 100000 times and surviving every time. each scenario is so tiny that it doesnt make a difference if theres a few extra zeros lol
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:30:32
why would u buy x amount of mining power when u can buy y amount of btc for that same x amount you could of payed in mining power. and y will always be &gt; the x's profits. this has been proven. buying btc is always the best. unless your producing the chips for mining and or if you have free electricity. at that point it might be worth it to buy the hardware and mine urself. if not then just buy btc. buying online mining power is just a scam. why would they sell you something that they can make more money on just holding. obviously they are selling you something that isnt going to make as much money as you could of made just buying bitcoin instead. if you dont believe do some research anyone that understand this well can explain it better then me. but either way as a hobby if u wanted to get into mining i guess it can be cool but if you want the profits btc is the better then cloud mining
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:51:04
not an address, bruteforce looking for random addresses to find one with btc on it. i know how cold wallet and hardware wallets work. ive been into btc since 2013. look at the link i provided about the collider project. they just randomly look through 10 tn addresses a day to find ones with btc. and they have found addresses with btc on it. not much but small amounts. one day our computers will be stronger and that might be not 10tn a day buy exponentially more.

@_date: 2017-08-14 14:07:21
if they had the option to buy cloud mining they for sure had the option to just buy btc instead. cloud mining is in general a scam. no1 is going to sell you a money printing machine.

or someone is trying to inflate the price for more to buy. lets see, if this buying volume lasts even 1months then u can say something. but 1day any coin can get pumped, even any useless coin too... 1days volume says nothing. if the volume of the price stays for more then a month u can re evaluate. for now its just a 1day thing.

this will go on untill they mine alot and their halvening makes it very improbable to be mining. also by then alot of bch that wasnt accessable will be in circulation aswell. and if the tx fees on bch dont go up. there will be no reason to mine it. but that is only when the blocks generate 0 new coins. so untill then it will always seemlingly have some time of having profit to mine it. when the difficulty drops.
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:54:18
thanks for understanding atlest what im asking. no1 seems to understand me. i understand how bitcoin works and how the addresses cold hot wallets work. i know its almost impossible. but if you search bitcoin collider youll see what im talking about. atleast someone here understands my question, i feel less like a retard for asking now lol
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:51:37

@_date: 2017-08-15 03:22:44
i use ledger nano s, just sometimes i want to consolidate all into 1 address so i wont have to pay fees later on just put in a low fee transactions overnight or something for it to slowly get into 1 address, but soemtimes i feel its more secure if its spread out. because of that site i once saw that brute forces btc addresses and already found some btc on random addresses.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:34:01
bcash might be more profitable. but whos going to buy those coins? when miners see nobody wants the coins the profit isnt real. also hashrate and nodes deciedes the majority not the profit

@_date: 2017-08-15 15:57:41
ledger nano s is what i used, but my question was because of the collider project. they have found addresses with small amounts of btc. so it would be economically best for me to consolidate my amounts into 1 address and into 1 transaction. this way in the future if i wanted to send out. it would cost me less in fees. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:14:50
thats perfectly fine. as spamming costs in fees and gives to the miners. actually in order for btc to scale we need to test all possible attack vectors. spam the mempool all they want. in the end they lose and btc proves resilient to this. btc has been attacked in all forms for years now. its fine it only proves its strength
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:33:05
which is the better code, that makes sense on every level. economically, computer power, politically, any and everyway, the code has to make sense in all senses. not just economically. but ofcourse that is one of the main indicators. the original code was best and is still the best. anything else is an experiment and will need to prove itself. its just a gamble. btc is proven to work. for many many years already and only getting better and better

why not just long everytime they give some fud. and profit? they not attacking. they giving us an opportunity to make some bank. edit: if they can really break btc then btc isnt worth anything. and if they cant then just buy more!

your offline btc wallet trezor or any other just has the information to be able to spend those bitcoins because it has the private keys on it. the network is what has your bitcoin. the ledger on every full node sees who has what. but only who has the private keys can spend it. you can send to an offline address thats never been used. just spending it will require you to sign a transaction with your private keys, thats what the wallets do. they dont need to be online for anything other then sending. and even that cna be done offline and just broadcast the tx to the network. nowadays you can even do it through satellite!

@_date: 2017-09-04 01:06:41
how do you expect the miners to continue mining once the block rewards are non existent? a fee market was always part of the initial idea. actually fees need to be higher then the block reward in order for the system to be secure and stable. this was always part of the original plan. we are still very very far from fees outweighing block rewards. why would you want to compromise the system when its still far from proving itself?

5k, way too much bull pressure. alot of international awareness the past few weeks. countries selling btc in post offices, in train stations. the "correction" had some ico ban news and dropped inlike 30% in a day. recovered 50% of in in like 2-3 days. thats super good sign imo. if a correction had extra fuel and still recovered rather quickly. you know that there is too much buy pressure and people just waiting for dips to buy more. weak hands sell and lose, noobs panic and lose. long term holders that see the fundamentals havent changed, that see btc actually making a slow economic impact, are just buying more during the dips. lets go btc!

ofcourse first split your coins on btc, before transaction on bcc. btc is the main chain, always move your coins on btc first and to your own wallet, once you do that, you can sell your bcc coins. thats the plan atleast for me
@_date: 2017-07-17 03:37:51
why do ppl buy when its high? the whole point is to buy something that is low, look for coins that are like -12% or more that means they are low, buy them, wait till they go up and then sell them. profit. its buy low sell high ;) 
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:24:02
No it's all a bluff to mine and buy more bitcoin for as cheap as possible for as long as possible. When they let it free watch it go to 500k like mcaffe says

really bcc should make it so replay attacks arent possible, why are they not putting it into their code to save replay attacks from happening? it just seems like they literally want to do as much harm to bitcoin as possible, but why? bitcoin can use all stress tests anyone wants to throw at it, it will only put more faith and trust into bitcoin in the end

I think jaxx keeps your keys unencrypted on your device. So long as no1 has access to the device ur using jaxx on. Then ur safe. I would rather have an encrypted wallet. So even if someone had direct access to my wallet files. Still without my long passphrase. They wouldnt be able to do anything

ofcourse its not a fork, its just like clam, do you think clam was a fork of btc? no, it is a totally different coin that was originally from the btc ledger, just like bcc, it is a new coin that is using existing btc ledger and then doing its own thing, its not a fork of btc, its nothing even close it it, it completely changes the rules of btc. ofcourse its not a fork, anyone that thinks otherwise just doesnt understand it

@_date: 2013-09-05 18:17:11
hmm i would create a new private and public address with bitaddress.org
then make a new wallet with blockchain.info
and add just the public key as watch only address,
and keep my private key either written down somewhere,
or save it somewhere with like the last few digits missing or first few w.e. uw ant and just memorize or write those down,
now anytime you need to send you can just with blockchain.info and it will ask for the private key, you can copy paste it where you have it saved, and just put in the rest that you have written down or something,
i dont know why i dont want to trust blockchain.info with my privatekey on there server, o.O
maybe im paranoid, but what if my wallet gets somehow hacked? or even keylogged or anything, atleast my private key wont be there o.O
edit;: i wouldnt trust coinbase to hold my btc, incase coinbase can down down, or maintenance or ddos or who knows what, atleast ill have my btc on my own not relying on anyone else really o.O
@_date: 2013-10-06 13:20:22
also if you check out keepbitcoinfree.org you can see that its possible to make offchain transactions and those can always be instant, just need to make such a transaction merchant, later if btc becomes alot more popular and will be worth alot more and miner fees go up, this offchain transaction merchant can be a profitable business, for now can stay onchain because transaction fees are rather low, plus u can use no fee and still be included usually within the day at most

this is but still its not the same as btc tc, i dont know the withdraw limits ect, and its 1/100 of share not a full share, also can u export them to your own wallet? also is there % management fee?, how easy is to get btc in and out of havelock? alot has to play here, not just the price, alot other things come in to play too!

no your not gambling something bad will happen, you are insuring that if g-d forbid something bad happens during your trip, you will have available funds to protect yourself,
for example medical insurance on a trip out of the country, can cost possibly 1$ per day,
but if g-d forbid you break a leg or need emergency or operation who knows, the insurance will take care of it, this way you are paying to be insured that if in case something does happen, you will be insured,
TLDR 
also things do happen, so if you insure yourself, you can protect yourself from such things

you forgot to put cost of hardware 9k since he said 8-9k it doesnt show a profit at 100% difficulty increase per month, even at coins priced at 210 per coin still no profit at 100% increase of difficulty per month, now 60% difficulty increase per month and coins at 210, which is being really generous with calcuations i mean extremely generous, you would earn about 2k for 1 years worth, really not worth the gamble here, because if that happens, you are much better off just buying coins you would double your money in a year if they are 210 each

unfortunatle BFL is a scam company, they have been taking thousands of orders since last year, and only sent out maybe 2 or 3 test samples to various reviewers just to build a bigger hype,
also they have been promising to send in 2 weeks for every 2 weeks for the past year,
so your returns will not look any good, thats even if you get it in a year, by then it wouldnt be worth having and wouldnt be worth its price,
but then again if bitcoin raises to half a million each coin, then possibly you might have some type of return, 
thats still if the company will even send anything to you,
and if they would you would have to wait for them to send thousands of orders first, which they still didnt send and promise to every 2 weeks delaying there shipment for some sort of reason
there is new posts like this almost every day we should have a sticky about this already
@_date: 2013-05-13 02:03:47
this just seems like a scam, why and who would take your bitcoins and give you back more in a few days... how is this possible?
they would need way more time to turn your bitcoins into actuall hardware, and then use the hardware to mine, and then pay you back, it would take much longer then a few days... this seems like a scam to me
@_date: 2013-08-19 05:34:43
basically you need to already have a wallet,
its like already having a bitcoin account, you can create a wallet from different ways, easy way is to download a client like bitcoinqt it will take a long time to sync and download the whole block chain, if you want to go that route, or you can use blockchain.info or many other ways,
once you have a public key, thats like your address, ppl can send you coins there, and only you can send coins from there to others, since you will not be giving your private key away to anyone,
are you understanding more about this now?
@_date: 2013-05-06 02:26:24
so look i think my method could work,
with your simulator i started with 10btc, initial, i bet only with the 50%
bet amount is .01, i dont know whats martignle so i left that off, and i always bet only 1 time,
so if i WON i would just repeat and bet again .01,
if i LOST i would double it to .02, now if i won i would go back to .01,
if i LOST i would double it again to .04, if won i would go back to .01,
if LOST i would double again to .08, only once i seen it get to .32,
and now im already at 10.5 btc, playing a few games, in matter of 2mins or less,
now what about transaction costs? looks like on satoshi minimum is .01 bet i would need atleast a bank of 5 or 10 btc incase i go on a losing streak,

cant i just simply sweep the key after i sign a transaction?
then if the blockchain wallet gets compromised it wouldn't even matter...
how is the security of the key not as secure? with blockchain.info that is,
but there can be otherways, can possibly install a software wallet in the persistence volume of the tails usb, its even encrypted and all that jazz!!!
whats your question??

why would you need a green adress when sending between trusted transaction parties, you can do that just aswell with a regular adress, if you see incoming coing before it got confirming if its from a trusted party, obviously they will not double spend...
@_date: 2013-05-13 02:08:12
no use the partition seperately as a seperate OS or even maybe have a seperate laptop just for wallets,
also how would malware search a seperate partition that it DOESNT EVEN SEE?
also why in the world would i download malware, especially on the partition i am using ONLY for wallets...
you mean have your partition on the same HD as an OS that you would download malware on, and that malware would search your ENTIRE HD INCLUDING YOUR OTHER PARTITION
but you can have that seperate partition encrypted if you really want, i doubt malware is so sophysicated to do this, i mean it can, but who will be dumb enough to download this malware lol...
everything you download you need to have proof its good, to make sure millions of other ppl rely on it and test it and see source of it... 
dont just go downloading random things and trying them, also dont give ur adresses or blockchain infos or anything to anyone, this way know1 will even know you have bitcoins, this way you will not even be targeted to try to be hacked, how can u be a target if no1 even knows u have it...
just be smart,
ofcourse not everyone is so computer literary, i guess bitcoins is just not for those ppl...
if you look at the billions of ppl in the world,
im sure atleast half dont have a computer or even acesss to one of internet or anything,
maybe even 1/4 or more dont even have electricity... i dont know the statistics but still thats what i would think atleast

definetly going up, asicminer has proved to be able to have good percent of network, that alone gives you like 30% per year dividends if not even more!
plus mining hw sales? thats like a 50% per year dividend? plus btc going up also after time, i mean if we are investing in btc we believe btc will be atleast 200 or more in a few years? then asicminer really is worth it! it took about a week to break a 2k wall of shares at 2.5 which had a 50 buy minimum, now it will slowly rise and rise, i think in a month it should be atleast 4!

@_date: 2013-05-11 04:05:38
theres ppl paying 300$+ to gpus that hash at 400mh+
but the gpus need a pci-e and more voltage and power, but ppl are still building gpu rigs. and even have gpu rig farms,
so this is the same except its easier to setup becasue no pcie and also much much less power, so it cost a bit more then a gpu, if you calculating the speed/price ratio, but you dont have to buy a mobo, and the mobo is limited to 4 gpu's max, and also you dont have to buy power supply and cpu and ram, aside from power for the psu cost alot more too,
so if you factor all that in, these are actually a good buy at 2btc each

@_date: 2013-10-07 13:57:18
no man, theres not much profit to be earned at the moment, because too many companies are promising huge amounts of hash for little amount of costs, meaning the difficulty will kind of sky rocket like its been doing, i honestly think it will be even higher then anyone expects, but even if its not you will earn only a tiny bit of profit for too much work put into it,
you better off really just buying the coins and holding, or maybe hold cash, if fbi liquidates there coins there might be a minor dip in prices and buy then for better cheaper coins,
thats just my 2btc ;)
@_date: 2013-08-17 21:45:14
colored coins? can you elaborate a little on this? this is the first time I'm hearing anything about that! any information i can read more about it!?
@_date: 2013-09-09 00:12:07
plenty of exchanges have gone down, dissapeared, been hacked, over and over and over,
keep your coins to yourself!!!!
exchanges can get ddos, can get bankrupt, can be hacked, anything can happen...
get your own private key, keep it safe, if you want write it down, except for like the last few digits write the somewhere else or memorize them, this way even if your private key is found, they wont be able to do much...
never know what will happen, coinbase can be shut down tomorrow if regulations changes or is sued or anything can happen,
keep your private keys to yourself, dont even let the network see them, keep everything cold storage if you can, and only a minimum should be on a hot wallet and only when you know you must need it,
keep your keys secure!!!!
o.O please dont downvote me, even if i am wrong i am entitled to my own opinion,
(ps coinbase sucks)

Seems like you went through too much trouble to secure your wallet and that might of drawn attention, in the end it proved all that time was worthless.
I keep it simple, I don't download anything on the partitions where my wallets are stored, I don't do anything else on those partitions, this way it's alot simpler

this too! btc going down slowly, i think we should cordinate slow drops so we can buy back alot cheaper, also make a nice flip maybe 2x? if we can get btc down to 50 each we can make an easy 2x flip because after 50 everyone knows its going to go back to atleast 100-200 ect..

@_date: 2013-08-19 21:44:44
client is the account manager that manages and gives you an interface, it does everything for you, you just type how much to send and to who, and press send it does it all for you it signs the transaction with your private key,
wallet is the file, the backup that all your private data is stored in, wallet is the file that the client uses to sign your transactions,
you dont really need to use a wallet, you can just have a private/public key, tell others your public key and ppl can send you btc,
now to send to others go to blockchain.info create a new wallet, and then click import and add a read only public address this way you can see who sent you how much and how much you have on your public key,
now in order to send from there it will ask for your private key, input that, and it will sign the transaction, this way no1 has access to your private key except you, and even blockchain.info will not have it stored on there server either,
now in order to get yourself a public/private key you can do it an easy way for example download a copy of bitaddress.org on your pc, then log off the internet unplug internet or w.e. then load that site, since you have it saved,
and save yourself copy of a public/private address, keep it safe, and out of harms reach, keep it away from malware infected computers or keylogged computers or anything like that. ect...

no lets just sell so when its 50 everyone will buy back and even more will buyback and when they see it rise even more will buy back and it will get higher then 500 higher then 1k each bitcoin but first it needs to go really really low so lets sell now lets do it!
@_date: 2013-06-14 09:20:44
yeah i have about 50 shares right now, i bought a 2.4,
i first initially bought like 30 shares at 1.65 and another 9 at like 2.5, then sold 39 at 2.65 and bought 50 at 2.4 :)
so ill prolly sell if i think there might be a small drop ahead so i can buy back even more, but im thinking its too risky and better just hold on to them, :) lols im greedy
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:30:24
wow almost hit 90 i saw,
lets do new record 80 cmon if we spread the word to panic sell im sure we can do 80 all together, and buy back lower and then raise to even higher, but lets try lower first lets do 80 we passed 90 lets do 80!!!! we can do it!
@_date: 2013-05-11 14:43:44
hmm, you have a point on resale value of the gpu and cpu and mobo, but theres not much, also there is the hassel of reselling it,
but still there is alot of benefits of the usb miners that the gpu miners dont have, maybe not resale value, but it has versatility of being easier to handle and manage for mining, also much less investment is needed to setup as they can just be plugged in usb,
idea is to make your money back within a year + extra profits from then on, and seems like should be able to make your money back in less then a year, this is considering the value of usd to btc staying the same... 
but if btc to usd goes up, which it most likely can...
then this investment of a miner will have payed for itself much faster,
and true once difficulty is very high, you will not be producing as much btc with this miner, but you still WILL be producing btc just much less with difficulty increases, but by then looks like you will have already payed for its initial costs, so its all profit...

bitinstant seems like the only proven method to get you bitcoins really fast, atleast the only i have seen... maybe there is others but they would need verifications ect. to be setup and those might take some time and then it might be more instant liek you want,
i would either continue to use bitinstant if you want something really fast right away and pay the fee,
or sign up to coinbase and wait and get them later without a fee,
seems like win/win to me ps look into buying some asicminer shares it looks like a good investment atm if you can get them for cheap

@_date: 2013-04-29 12:07:49
this is the flaw that i see in bitcoin, right no computers are strong, but as we see, the computational power is growing exponentionally and really fast, we have no idea how fast computers will be in 10 years, 20 years, 30 years? how bout 100years?
the computers can be so strong and powerful enough that it can crack the bitcoin system, maybe even be able to create already known adress, and other not knowable stuff at the moment,
but untill then the bitcoin system seems pretty safe,
ps i mine with a 140mh almost everynight, and have about .05 bitcoins from a week or more of mining, and i would invest some savings also if it was only easier...

@_date: 2013-09-01 19:12:27
the network is designed to adjust itself,
meaning if less mine, the difficulty will drop, if more mine it goes back up,
this way it readjusts itself,
if it becomes unprofitable, more ppl will stop mining,
and difficulty will go down, making it profitable again, and more will start mining again, ect. ect..

its 3x at next difficulty change, what about the next one after that? it would probly go back to less then am dividends, because here you paying for hash rate, with am you have a part of the company that adds more hash, and can add another 200th but not doing that so they have only 20-30%, also selling hardware and more profit,...
this deal is good for 1 week, and then sell it back at same price in a week, but i doubt that will even be possible
@_date: 2013-05-11 16:11:07
i had the same problem as you,
it seems it is common knoweldge that in order to make a transaction you must send ALL of your bitcoins, part of them will go to where you like and the rest are stored on a backup adress of yours as i understand correctly, that means the .2695 was your remainder, and you still have acess to them through a client like qt you still have them, just on blockchain it shows it has been sent to another adress which really it has, which is another of your adresses' that qt or the client has for you, without you even knowing,
anyone can confirm with me i have the general idea of how this works?
@_date: 2013-06-05 09:38:52
for 500$ you can buy 2 usb asicminers they are i think like 2btc each in group buys maybe 2.1 each shipped to you,
and you can start mining with them, but with difficulty really really increasing, i mean huge spikes coming online really fast, it might be you might never get your initial investment, or might take a long time, more then a year,
keep in mind new generation chips are also being produced and designed, so the difficulty will keep increasing at higher rates,
your better off buying share with asicminer, or buying bitcoins and just keeping them,
but if you want to just do it as a hobby, i would buy the asicminer usb miners, thats what i have coming to me in mail soon, :)
@_date: 2013-05-18 01:51:28
i would assume the more that is mined, the harder the difficulty is going to go, the price of bitcoin should go up, because supply will be more scarce, and also harder to obtain because difficulty is also higher, also by then more ppl adapted to bitcoin so demand should rise also, if this is the model then the price should be ever increasing with time, average, ofcourse with spikes in either direction shorterm

i use it as transactions. anytime i want to buy something on amazon i get like a 15% discount if u find someone to buy for me through localbitcoins.com if i want to send my family or friends money i use bitcoin because they are far from me.
@_date: 2013-08-16 18:11:19
or send that 1million to another country? without paying taxes or claiming customs, ect. ect. ect.?
@_date: 2013-09-08 23:58:10
sure you can make an off chain service that is totally transparent,
bitcoin is fine, long ways to go before we really MUST NEED off chain transactions,
for now you can send and usually within a day even with no fees you will be included in a block... and honestly if you put in 1 transaction several transfers, that tiny fee for all your transfer is really small
@_date: 2013-06-14 08:20:16
sell for sure you can make a profit, it will probly be atleast 2.8 again sometime in the next few days but if not then it will just continue to rise, and if it doesnt hit 2.7 again in few days then it must be on a high rise to atleast 3 or more!!! thats for sure, sell if u want a quick profit, or hold if u want to make more profit in the long run with less moving btc around,
but if u want to fund a different investment or want some quick gains then yes sell ofcourse ull get your gains, just know ifu hold it must likely will continue to go up, asicminer has proved to be elite in the bitcoin game,
@_date: 2013-06-09 23:19:45
where did you trade them? i also started with less then 50 and im at 120+ atm i also invest in asciminer shares get dividends and sometimes sell for higher and buy more shares for lower :)
@_date: 2013-10-07 20:55:36
true, i guess you did it smart this way you dont lose a huge deposit by mistake, 130 is fine, how long did it take to accumulate that 130? just wondering...
@_date: 2013-05-06 02:01:21
is there a pattern that i can take advantage of at this site?
like lets say my bank is 1k,
and i bet 1, if i lose i double to bet 2, if i lose i double to bet 4, and keep double untill i win, if i win i just bet 1 again,
and continue over and over, to slowly get gains, is this possible? 
lets say i have bank to double bet over 10 or even 20 times,
if the chance to win is close to 50/50, out of 10 or 20 tries i have to win atleast once,
anyone understand what im talking about? i wanted to try this and see if its possible,
@_date: 2013-06-17 04:47:47
i support dont gamble !
@_date: 2013-05-20 18:41:29
woohoo! good news for asicminer and shareholders!
@_date: 2013-05-30 16:44:07
first, you dont need to wait 14minutes, in order to try to double spend you need a substantial amount of hash power to even try or attempt that, and in that case your better using that hash power to mine, you would profit more then attempting to double spend,
also, there can trusted middle men, in this video you can see how it would work, to have a trusted vendor that either you can store your bitcoins with, and use them at will at accepted places, or other possible ideas, (
theres no problem with bitcoins being a several minute transfer, that actually makes it more secure, and more safe, thats a good thing, thats not a problem thats a benefit...
@_date: 2013-06-16 06:46:43
i rather bitcoin be exclusive, not an everyday everywhere accepted currency

what if someone created a quantum computer asic for bitcoin only,
@_date: 2013-06-14 10:57:05
yeah i think of it the same way! and if all else fails i loose but if i win! i can win big!
also alot to play when such big amounts of money are in play, the security of the sites ect.
@_date: 2013-06-14 08:30:00
yeah its going to go up ofcourse, asicminer has proven to be elite in the bitcoin game, all share holders obviously believe it, why else would it go up in price? ofcourse... wasnt that a given?
@_date: 2013-08-20 14:45:12
panic sell panic sell,
lets drop price even lower, this way we can buy back more shares
i want more share?!
how low do you think we can get the price to go?
@_date: 2013-05-21 15:23:22
cant you still bet just using the adresses, whats from stopping you? and receiving your payments?
its just there website doesnt allow, not the betting system itself.
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:41:54
i won 51 btc by accident thinking im betting on x2 but betted on the x32 adress with satoshidice
i was going to use 10btc betting .01 using martingale strategy to make a small win maybe 11btc and stop or 10.5btc and stop.
but after all my doubles and kept losing i saw a 54 incoming, then realized i was betting on x32 adress, i invested my btc into asicminer shares and also some asicminer usbs, since then the shares went up, i bought shares worth 46btc now my shares are worth atleast 54+ btc and i even got dividends today for 1+btc.
i think won gambling
BTW i will not advice anyone to do this, as its a proven loss if you play enough times. i was just going to stop after a small win,
@_date: 2013-05-10 01:45:44
that would be nice, but that can also be incorporated into more confirmations, whos to say they should be 10minute average, why not 10 per secound average? why not have an infinite amount of ever increasing in both ways faster and longer confirmations, to be able to value transactions, also can be alot alot alot alot alot more harder to try to double spend in almost any situation even in smaller quantities in smaller amounts of time...
instead of relying on a larger pool, but still relying on larger pools can also be implemented and seems like a strong skillset to be able to offer and even get profits from...
interesting ideas this is great, but programmers are the ones that need to implement them, sometimes you need genius so the code will be unexploitable...
@_date: 2013-06-05 08:47:52
asicminer first company to sell mass amounts of asics and have them shipped overnight after auctions, asicminer grew from .1 to 2.5 ish, and still growing except for the walls that early investors sell to secure there profit,
asicminer is increasing hashrate, and even selling hardware in order to increase there hashrate, because its already higher then 20% and they dont want to go too high,
so the sell mining hardware, and for a decent profit aswell, really overpriced compared to other asic companies but they ship it right away so you can count on it, if they lower prices for the hardware they are selling, and also sell there own hardware, they can easily manufacture next generation chips, and be the first to have them first to sell them again, and once again being ontop,
they have the lead, they have the advantage, they already have the hashrate, and the mining equiptment for more, and even to sell some, and even the funds to build new generation chips which they are designing, 
asicminer is the future!

@_date: 2013-06-14 08:26:14
why would u gamble its either an investment, or you believe its secure way to hold money that will have deflationary value,
why else would u have bitcoin? to buy something real quick that is available only in bitcoin? or just as a hobby? or to mine and make profit? theres different reasons, but gambling is its own seperate thing, yes gambling is like giving the house an edge, and theres arguments when gambling might be worth it, but in most cases its usually not other then buying that 1 ticket to win the lottery, just incase ur luck was to win you can always bet .0001 btc or w.e. for really high odds if u want, but u dont have to gamble?
this is just to profit and experiment with the market, to see how secure bitcoin really is :)
@_date: 2013-06-10 04:46:03
why buy? lets just drop it low again lets get to like 50 alltime record?
stop buying lets drop low this way we can buy back and profit, cmon lets get cheap btcs lets get btcs at 50 each lets do 10 each btc,,, we will be come so rich cmon lets do it!
@_date: 2013-05-18 01:26:04
everytime i ordered it has been locked in for me at the rate i ordered, but i noticed sometimes if there was alot of volatility in a day or maybe they sold alot during a certain day, it changed to if you buy now you will get the price that it is in a week, ect. and i didnt buy during those times, and i see it went bac to normal lock in after a few hours or w.e. time peroid,
so when you are buying read correctly what it says im and sure it will be success

today the dividend was like .038 per share that cost 2.5 each share,
thats pretty good dividend for weekly,
and the dividends have only been going up, and looks like they will still grow, more hardware sales new hardware designs, plus still controlling 20-30% hashrate, asicminer really is looking amazing right about now
@_date: 2013-05-24 17:20:03
panic sell panic buy, rollercoaster weekend ahead!

this is amazing, shifting power to the cheaper power regions,
@_date: 2013-06-26 19:36:14
isnt there plenty of resellers on the bitcointalk forums? that will ship it for like 1btc or so?
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:24:00
My thoughts is bfl is a scam and is not shipping, they are almost a year late on shipping, with shipping being pushed back and back every so often. 
If I was them this is how somebody acts when they don't want to ship anything to anyone

even if there is only 1 available bitcoin left and all the others are lost, the bitcoin system still works, and can be infinitely divided, that 1 bitcoin can be spread to millions of people, and they can still trade, and send amounts to each other, the value of the bitcoin doesn't matter,
its the fact that you can trade currency so easily all over the world with hardly any fee and with anonomously. thats what makes the value of it, not how many there are or how many there is left or how many are lost. that wouldnt matter much.
its the fact that you can trade anonomous large amounts of currency all over the world in a matter of minutes, without anyone knowing or tracking you or stopping you... thats what gives bitcoin value, its the system itself, and ever increasing more stronger and stronger base and foundation, by having more and more hashes around the world keeping the blockchain legit, also by helping process transactions, the larger it gets the harder it will be to stop, and already it is pretty large it would be difficult to just shut down EVERY BITCOIN NODE ALL OVER THE WORLD, imagine in a few more months? or more? try stopping it then...

all you need to do is have your own wallet from like blockchain or something,
if your buying bitcoins from him, he should bring a laptop or use his phone. just give him your public key to send it to,
confirm on blockchain.info that he sent it, if u want wait for a confirmation but you dont even have to wait for that, and then give him the cash,
different ways to give him your public key, you can upload it to yourself on a throw away account somewhere, this way u can log in the acc on his laptop or email him the public key before meeting, or w.e. u want
know what i mean?

correction 51% attacks are not worthwhile ever, in order to even "attempt" something even close to a "51%" attack you would need considerable amount of hashing power, thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars mining equiptment, and at that point, it would be way better to use that equiptment to just mine, you would make more then risk using it for a 51% attack,
@_date: 2013-06-11 00:24:32
wow sorry to hear i never had a problem with coinbase, anytime i wanted to withdraw within minutes at most it would show in the blockchain and my personal wallet client,

@_date: 2013-06-10 03:15:33
i think this is not a problem, if we leave transaction fees into effect, this way the ppl with more transaction fee will have chance to be confirmed faster, and less transacton fees slower, also to have precedent to time too,
they shouldnt change the block limit, that wouldnt be good, just leaving it and letting transaction fees work out the way satoshi nakamoto designed it in the first place :)

advantages of lower price exchange per usd,
means usd did not inflate so much, or atleast not so fast ect.
another advantage, more likely for others to buy, i mean when would u rather buy at the peak of 250? or back when it came down to 50?
i think 50 because u know the only reason its worth 50 is because not enough adopted it, but buy buying it we are betting on the adoption to eventually be there,
so earlier adoption is bigger rewards,
more people interested in early adoption/ bigger rewards, ect... so more buy in at lower prices more talk about it more read about more spread the word, more work on it, ect. spreading alot faster then if it was at a higher price? maybe/ or maybe it can spread fast at high price too... just seems like lower price can have its advantages aswell
@_date: 2013-09-06 08:22:31
good note,
@_date: 2013-06-28 19:08:04
this is good! cheaper bitcoins will bring influx of more widely adopted! because it will be an incentive for new adopters, since its so much cheaper at the moment, and it even proved itself at higher value, so more people would be interested in trying it,
lets keep it low, if you have alot of money in bitcoin, maybe cash out for a year or two and keep it cheaper for now :)
it will spread so much faster!
@_date: 2013-07-16 19:35:22
what do u mean? which address did you send the btc to? is it your address? do you have access to the private key of that address?
@_date: 2013-06-30 17:21:37
no please dont buy i would like to keep prices lower so i can re invest dividends,
actually if you have why not sell? this would make the bigger sellers maybe also possibly sell and we can buy more with dividends :)

i think this will pay for itself back in maximum 1 year, (plus these are alot easier to setup then a gpu and much less power too, can just plug into a laptop or desktop ect..)
anyone have an investment that can pay for itself in 1 year and then after that its pure profit?
@_date: 2013-08-20 08:05:10
maybe coinbase needed some more btc asap so they changed the price this way more would sell so they cold have more since they needed them just at that time,

i dont sse anyone shouting hold it that would be stupid, best thing is to sel sel sell and get price lower and buy back in lower so you can profit, why in the world would u hold it? if u see its dropping sell to make a profit buying back when its lower,,,, thers no logic in holding when its droppping, obiviously best thing to do when its dropping is sell and cause mass mass panic sell so u can buy it back even lower,
@_date: 2013-05-10 01:41:33
i was thinking more of eventually having mini confirmations even thousands per secound, so aside form the main main infustructure confirming, there would be smaller within confirming atleast from there part, so still each transaction would still go through all the confirmations even the 10minute average ones now would not dissapear and still be there, but also be ever increasing amount of faster confirmations aswell, smaller ones, so you can eventually be sending ever smaller amounts of btc and faster and even smaller and faster
and on the other side also have larger confirmations then the average 10minutes also, maybe have 1hour confirmations ect. basing on the average of time or speeds or anything...
the possibilities are endless, you can maybe one day have interglobal transfers, maybe planet to planet, galaxies to galaxies,
and with the increasing amount of population in the world, can also take advantage of a faster processing system,
i think we are living in the sci fi days
@_date: 2013-06-17 07:43:26
there can always be middle men, like banks or bigger company that holds your bitcoin, and lets you use them to spend it at all available accepters, kinda like creditcards, having an account with a middle company that will send out your bitcoins to retailers, and they can lower your fees, because they might be sending out much more transactions and they can bunch them all up in 1 fee, ect.
this is a good example
edit TLDR offchain transactions :)
@_date: 2013-06-12 09:30:13

well if your selling with coinbase, it could be better if they use mtgox price,
not everyone buys btc? some ppl sell it! so cant please everyone, i for one would rather them have mtgox price so i can sell for a higher price to them :)
so dont assume they will lose alot of customers, they can get alot of customers that way too!!!!

betcoindice.tm is a good site and a good company, they are reliable trustworthy and very polite and professional,
first of all anyone can play at there site so why blame them for  playing there, 2nd of all who cares if they promote and advertise through the blockchain, if they pay tx fees they are entitled just like anyone else the blockchain is free for anyone its decentralized, anyone can do anything. thats the whole point of bitcoin
but aside from that betcoin is a great company, ive had plenty of experience with them and there customer support also, they always pay out and almost instantly even if its 100+ btc, there support is kind polite and professional always ready to help in anyway they can,
they have plenty of games to choose from and always innovating something new and interesting, they also listen to there customers and willing to work with them and change anything thats needed,
there a great company, this is just people hating on them,
if you have haters you know you must be doing something right, thats just how it works there will always be opposition for doing things right,
betcoin is great company that will last because there work ethic is great! and it will prove itself in the long run!

min .01 max 500,
it would really take a long time to get to 500 max and still lose all those in a row, but looks like there are calculators out there that prove my method is not good for the long run,
like if you start with 10btc and you want to get to 10.1 or 10.5 you might have a decent chance but if you trying to get 10btc to turn int 100, you will lose before you get that many wins,
here is calculators i saw
i still think there might be some kind of mathematical way of turning some bitcoins for profit, with a higher chance of winning then losing, i just dont know how far it can really go,

because, when you know something has been proven to be worth alot more, and now its cheap, it would be easier for more people to trust or take the gamble/risk ect. or might even help spread more to buy into it,
its simple its like if gold has been proven to be bought at higher prices, and its deflationary, and theres a limit to how much there is, and the price fell, wouldnt that be in a reason in itself for me to want to buy more gold at that moment, or if i can ect.

one of the key points of bitcoin is to have a decentralized, deflationary currency,
deflationary is key, and its one of the main points and main ideas behind it,
its like one of the whole points of bitcoin is for it to be limited and deflationary,
change that and your changing the whole point of why bitcoin was made

well none of these addresses really have any substantial amount of BTC, actually 3/4 of them only had .003 ever sent to them.

so this is the beginning of off-chain transactions?
this is great news! this will help make transactions more instant instead of the 10minute average block
also will help eliminate transactions fees, even with them being so small, this off-chain transactions can be almost free!
(this will help especially when transactions fees will go up!)
kind of what keepbitcoinfree.org explains!
this is great news!

you getting the hang of it a bit,
private address is used to sign a transaction,
lets say you want to send btc from one of your addresses to some1 elses address, you need to prove that key belongs to you, by signing that transaction, and in order to provide the correct signature you are proving that you have the private key without publicizing the private key itself...
a wallet contains both private and public keys and i think it contains more, it probly depends which client you used to create your wallet.

so what if he is goth and brings his girlfriend on a dog leash,
practice your social skills and you can small talk with anyone, its no big deal, stop judging people from the goth point of you, you could look weird to him also, just like he looks weird to you, doesnt mean you cant share 10 minutes together...
