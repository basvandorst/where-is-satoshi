Thanks for the responses so far. I would still like to know if there is a better exchange than coinbase to do this with, also I am down for any crypto friendly online only banks (with fast deposits). I know some of the larger banks halted crypto exchange funding.

Bitcoin, and various Cryptocurrencies IS my savings. In life I never could keep a savings account above $1,000 (Like the 62% "MAJORITY" of ALL people in the US). 
My Savings account in crypto has paid off so far, if I lost half of its value I would still be ahead. For the new money I dump into it monthly, it is well worth the risk for this College dropout. My Worst Case Scenario is going back to exactly how I was before, a typical wage slave stuck in a cubicle that gives away my time to taxes, including the hidden tax of inflation.

I dont hate him, he is an entertainer that discusses topics you do not often hear elsewhere, with a extreme libertarian conspiracy twist. He is actually "entertaining" in 5-10 min burts imho.
With that out of the way, I am glad to see he pivoted quickly to be diplomatic inserting humor into it. I havent listened to his show in a long time but i dont think it has ever had me laugh so hard.

100% disagree with this.
If you want to purchase anything with a 0% interest card, do it. The key is to pay your bills on time and never spend more on credit than you have the cash to cover.
I have spent a credit card on coinbase, and paid it off that month 4 times since last june. To call it a cash advance is literally them calling it currency, which flies in the face of how the government classafies it. They are using this method to charge insane interest on a purchase in an underhanded way, because banks have that kind of power.
I am interested to know which banks and credit cards have noe listed it as a cash advance.
If its a cash advance, I shouldnt have to pay taxes on withdrawing it AS cash.
