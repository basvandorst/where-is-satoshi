Security breach on Bitfinex
Today we discovered a security breach that requires us to halt all trading on Bitfinex, as well as halt all digital token deposits to and withdrawals from Bitfinex.
We are investigating the breach to determine what happened, but we know that some of our users have had their bitcoins stolen. We are undertaking a review to determine which users have been affected by the breach. While we conduct this initial investigation and secure our environment, bitfinex.com will be taken down and the maintenance page will be left up.
The theft is being reported to — and we are co-operating with — law enforcement.
As we account for individualized customer losses, we may need to settle open margin positions, associated financing, and/or collateral affected by the breach. Any settlements will be at the current market prices as of 18:00 UTC. We are taking this necessary accounting step to normalize account balances with the objective of resuming operations. We will look at various options to address customer losses later in the investigation. While we are halting all operations at this time, we can confirm that the breach was limited to bitcoin wallets; the other digital tokens traded on Bitfinex are unaffected.
We will post updates as and when appropriate on our status page,  We are deeply concerned about this issue and we are committing every resource to try to resolve it. We ask for the community’s patience as we unravel the causes and consequences of this breach.

Other than the default censorship (in this release, aka spam filters) it's good to run different software for full modes and wallets. 
It makes Bitcoin stronger and helps identify potential problems on the network.
@_date: 2016-08-20 06:53:47
I think your question left out the favorite hardware wallet of this sub. Trezor.

Bitcoin's killer app is central bank resistant money. 
There are many degrees of central banks varying from outright corrupt to insolvent to well managed thus varying degrees of need for Bitcoin for people forced into any of these systems by their gov't based on where they live. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:55:20
FDIC, ha.
You will lose the most. Do not keep more than you're willing to loose in a bank. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 05:24:36
Your measuring against dollars. 
Unfortunately my bitcoins have not increased by 90% and 35% respectively the last two years. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:28:00
If you do a 2 of 2 multisig CoPay with your phone and your computer you can be very, very secure. 
Save both seed phrases, write them only on paper, not screenshots or text files. 
You can then always re-setup your phone or computer if you loose them, or reinstall, whatever.

Personally I'm waiting for them to finish their Omni integration so people can send them to their own wallets similar to Tethers.

I said wait until September, true, but not for going mainstream. 
We still have to get to 1 trillion dollar market cap for that. 
Plus, wet dreams aside, we can only hope to overtake gold's use case not fucked up gov'ts use case.

"German Savers" is like saying everyone in Germany because saving is part of their culture.

There is no such thing as moving Bitcoin over borders.  It already exists equally on both sides of the border.  Nothing is being transfered (aka spent) unless you do a transaction as you step across a border.

Let the race begin, man!

People do different things with money, man. 
No need to be so defensive, man :)
@_date: 2016-08-25 19:40:58
Just like any good form of money it's good to use it when you need it and save it when you don't. 
On that note dollars are a guaranteed loss of wealth long term. I make sure I don't have too many of those. 
This sounds a little radical if you are not in tune how central banks work, especially the Federal Reserve. 
So take my comment with a grain of salt, learn about how the banking system works and then ask yourself the same question again.

Bitfinex users got back 40% of what they lost already. (BFX trading roughly 40 cents to the dollar). 
Haircut is down to around 22%. That is in the range of how much a person could gain or loose on a single trade. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:52:10
You should learn about @_date: 2016-08-24 07:00:53
Same as any other margin. 
If you don't like it, don't bitch, it's optional. 
For those that like it it's good to have another use for them. 
Please note the "haircut" is already significantly REDUCED because the BFX tokens already have a value you can trade in for BTC or USD. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 07:24:52
Aaron, man. Any plans for multisig with Breadwallet?
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:06:26
Bitstamp only uses BitGo for hot wallets. IIRC, 98% of bitcoins are stored offline in cold storage. Bitstamp posted this information today. Look it up if you want.

Thanks, man.

Too bad the hack was not Ethereum only.  They could have re-written the blockchain for Bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:12:01
They didn't get reimbursed because the CEO actually sent the bitcoin.  BitPay is insured for specific things, but not CEO stupidity on a massive scale.
BitPay recovered, obviously.
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:07:05
Apparently BitGo is only safe with insurance. 
BitGo's underwriters are going to do a policy hike!

Suppose you can remember a 12 word seed or some long passphrase that is your brain wallet.
PS, there are no coins on any phone.  They exist only on the bitcoin ledger, which contains all transactions.
Having private keys to spend transactions is loosely equivalent to having the password to your online banking account which would also let you spend your money.
The point is police are not actually trying to stop crimes but to steal.
@_date: 2016-08-25 09:57:30
Short answer. They don't work. Only one transaction will confirm (aka work)
Medium answer Peter Todd had some tools to generate such transactions.

Had the DAO been on Counterpart/Bitcoin there would have been no Blockchain rollback/editing.
I stand by my opinion that a blockchain that can be edited should not deserve the respect to be called a blockchain. We already have a name for that, databases.

Once that happens other exchanges will start trading them.

Summary. We can't saw anything. 
Take away. BitGo as a product is now useless unless you also have insurance. Might as well just go with insurance then.

0conf for small transaction. Many places still do and it's not a bad idea you, as a merchant must know your own business risk. 
Here is the great answer. 
Edit. Take luke-jr with a grain of salt. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 05:29:48
That's just, like, your opinion, man. :)
I like Breadwallet UI best but I don't use it because I prefer to use multisig with Copay, and I think Copay's UI is better than Jaxx too. 
Still waiting for Jaxx to do litecoin
@_date: 2016-08-24 12:01:35


Good one, man. Compare the two rich lists for the two currencies.
@_date: 2016-08-25 20:14:33
A single confirmation basically protects you from a double spend.
The reason people wait up to 6 transactions for permanency is because with the amount of hashing power doing the mining, it's virtually impossible to chance the ledger at that point.
@_date: 2016-08-19 18:49:49
You can use Trezor with:
- 
- Copay
- Mycelium 
- Electrum
- Trezor Python Wallet 
More? Probably...
There are no worries. :)
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:33:05






Seems like Bitfinex and BitGo need to see who lived up to their mutual contract or not.
@_date: 2016-08-24 12:04:43


That's now how Monero works. Monero works by keeping track of how many 0.0000001, 0.000001, 0.00001, 0.0001 ... 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc moneros there are and how many of what your private key can spend from each pool of tokens.
If you send 1 monero, you are sending 1 monero that could have belonged to ANYONE before. There is no prior connection.

How do we get around this fucking problem, man!
Solve that and bitsquare is golden.

- "The Blockchain" is Bitcoin. 
- "A" blockchain can be any other implementation of the technology. 
Is your headline correct?
@_date: 2016-08-30 14:03:51
Yeah. Police state is out of control.  This was a scare case to scare people into complacency. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 13:27:49
Camera, yeah, great idea, man. That's like the only unrestricted input on the iPhone. Paging to pass on the idea. 
I would love some Trezor integration on an iPhone!
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:11:56
100% securely, I might add. I'm sure the BitGo API used TLS to tunnel all the withdraws.
@_date: 2016-08-15 05:08:01
This must change man. When is enough enough?
Fucking police state. Seems like the only thing that will stop the fucking police state is its own ability to fuck up a money supply. 
There's hope yet.

Bitcoin is made to be an alternative money and property ledger as opposed to fucked up gov't accounting and gov't money supplies.

You said "risks". Haha. I think you mean is. 
@_date: 2016-08-24 19:19:01
I don't pump shit coins, man.
Monero is exciting. The community and the development are like bitcoin was years ago... fun!
PS. This is a reply in to a specifically about Monero. I simply answered.
Take it easy, man.
@_date: 2016-08-28 05:31:13
This can't happen because banks don't just give account at to anyone. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 09:55:12
@_date: 2016-08-30 14:04:17
Makes sense.
The dude abides.
@_date: 2016-08-06 05:32:55
at least Bitfinex seems to be wanting to give customers some of their money back and try and run their business again. 
New banking laws for a failed bank makes customers creditors, like a stock owner vs a deposit holder. The bank fails and you own stock of something that has a price approaching zero with no way to trade or short the stock like a normal investor. 
As much as this Bitfinex heist sucks it's a normal expected risk. 
I also only keep as much as I'm willing to loose in banks. 
What am I blathering about? I'll tell you what I'm blathering about. The Bitcoin economy is really distributed now. We've lost a significant exchange but we have many more still functioning. 
When the bank closures start accelerating faster than gov'ts can hide them, there will be no decentralized loss. Everybody will loose, except those of us now smart enough to be our own bank. 
Ahoh, Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 09:51:23
Nice. Way to give us the private key. Checking it out, man. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 09:00:11
That's the problem with police.
Money should not be the crime. The crime should be the crime.
But, the system is fucked up. We have to take it into our own hands if we don't want to be stolen from by banks, gov'ts, criminals, etc.
@_date: 2016-08-15 05:01:09
Dude does not abide the default censorship (aka spam filters). If a transaction pays a fee it should be treated as equal to any other transaction that pays the same fee.
@_date: 2016-08-22 18:08:07

Feels like a roller coaster. But dollars and euros are exactly like the titanic as far as wealth preservation is concerned. 
@_date: 2016-08-28 05:17:00
This happened with dollars, only worse!
Started saving them in the 70s. 
$2000 used to buy a new car and $10000 a house. 
They've been a shitty invrstment (the dollars, that is) and a few years back I decided to call it quits. 
Wealth is not I dollars anymore. 
Luckily the car and house have retained their values. 
My advice for long term investing is get rid of dollars for almost anything else. 
Gold and Bitcoin being at the top of my favorite list. 
Check out Monero for some 2013 style Bitcoin growth. 
@_date: 2016-08-20 00:25:56
yeah. But it's better than not doing it :)
Too bad Monero wasn't the first crypto :)

Works for me. We have Bitcoin and for anonymous transactions we have Monero. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:25:04
I would like to see volume and liquidity. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:40:29
It's quite possible. 
It boils down not to who is at fault but if BitGo, with its massive VC funding wants to keep a good name for themselves or not. If not then I see any relavence of BitGo and the VC money just evaporating over the next year. Alternatively if BitGo steps up they can secure their brand and secure the future VC value to position itself even higher in the years to come. 
Seems like a no brainer. I can't believe BitGo VC would be worrying about the small fish as is this heist and not focusing on future relevance in a space they could own!
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:09:29
There's no such way to say gox better than gox.  If Bitstamp goes down we can say stamped, but with Bitfinex?  What's the word going to be!?

A very good reason to have a Trezor and especially not keep any Bitcoin in online wallets such as Coinbase, Circle, etc.

As far as practicing goes. You can use ShapeShift.io to switch your Bitcoin to Litecoin. I also suggest using electrum-Litecoin with your Trezor for your Litecoin wallet.
The reason I say this is you can have so much fun because Litecoin confirms in about 3 minutes and you can send with zero fee. You can do 1000s of transactions and not dwindle away your Litecoin in fees.
Then for long term savings, you should diversify.

Bitcoin is already bigger than the US Gov't balance sheet. All bitcoins in existence is about $6 billion (9 zeros) and no debt is owed on these coins.  The US Gov't balance sheet is roughly -19 trillion (12 zeros and a minus symbol). 
This sounds petty and nieve I know but that NEGATIVE number keeps getting more negative and using world history as a guide I would say jokes about the US Debt will become serious.  Some of us think it is serious now but we are in the minority.

This always confuses me because. Say, I spend 100$ to buy one Bitcoin. 
Then later I spend 1 Bitcoin on a bike. Or one Bitcoin on a leather jacket. How would I know the dollar equivalent of either of those things when they are priced in Bitcoin and I buy with Bitcoin?
Alternatively, does that mean each time I earn a dollar, then wait some time for the US to debase the dollar more I can deduct the difference of what used to cost $0.80 when I earned the dollar to what now costs a $1.00?
@_date: 2016-04-11 10:35:42
That's like saying they don't accept dollars because they use visa.

Ditto. No contactless here either. Just normal insert chip/pin.

Xapo seriously has a better than good rate while the other cards typically at best have a -3% or worse rate. Probably because xapo also sells Bitcoin to people directly.

Even more awesome is a 2 of 2 shared wallet with Copay.  Use the Copay App and a Copay App fork (Mike Tyson Bitcoin) on one phone and you'll really start feeling safe with your coins -- though an extra step to authorize payment. 
Usage is similar to having the extra burden of Google Authenticator.

If you have Bitcoin you don't need a safety deposit box. 
If you are in the US I would not store anything of value in a safe deposit box anyway, only documents for safe keeping. 
They keep changing the rules and laws not in our favor. 
For example, starting last year or maybe 2 years ago you are not allowed to store cash. (Chase). I mean, WTF?  
I lost my train of thought there. What was I blathering about? Right. If you have Bitcoin, You don't need no stinkin' safe deposit box.

So is just effectively even less than effectively zero fees for sending Bitcoin directly? :)
Compared to the average $60 for a bank wire transfer, 3.5% for credit cards and fuck-shit load for Western Union. 
Effectively zero sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?

I hope you all realize when bitcoin reaches whatever high value that you are okay selling at your going to have a hard time selling:
You will start thinking about things like this:
- EU bank guarantees 100000€
- US bank guarantees $250000
- Euro/Dollar etc constantly devaluing themselves
- in the US at least basically everything can be stolen from you by police because of civil asset forfeiture. (Bitcoin, if not stupidly left on an exchange or your seed phrase without password laying in your positions, will resist civil asset forfeiture)
- Taxes
Where are you going to put your wealth that could possibly be safer than bitcoin?
You will end up not selling your Bitcoin. 
You’ve been warned/informed.

Xapo and Anx are the best two. 
Xapo is nice because you spend BTC exchanged in real time at a great rate. Almost always spot price or close. 
Anx is great if you are more into preloading. You have to use the Anx exchange and load it that way. 
Both can be authorized for unlimited amounts. 
Xapo righ now is a no brainier, I believe their holiday price is $10/10€ for the card. 
I think Xapo is ultimately the best. If you want to "lock in" some dollar prices that you can layer spend or withdraw with Xapo card you can use a service such as uphold.com.
Edit: you really have to plan in advance if you want to use Anx. It takes up to 48 hours during business days to load the card. 
Xapo only has to wait for 6 Bitcoin confirmations if you Xapo Bitcoin wallet is empty. 
Edit 2: Xapo card is has a chip in card. Not sure about the recent Anx.

Microsoft tried so hard with MSN to wall people only to them. AOL, Prodigy, Compuserve. 
But once Marc Andresson(?) unleashed Netscape Navigator that was it. People had a taste of what we were building on the Internet and realized MSN, AOL, etc were just walled, themed playgrounds. 
The closest example that is easy to imagine is like all you could get to was Yahoo, but then you found a way out and could see everything else new that was popping up daily!
Yahoo was one of the things people wanted to escape AOL to get to. Yahoo was the index for the rest of everything. Yahoo is irrelevant now.

It's not different! (You un-hypocrite you!)   That's why bitcoin is a superior money. Because there is no counterparts risk unless you actually decide to have it. By default bitcoin is in complete control of the owner and only the owner. Anyone with bitcoins in a bitcoin "bank" or exchange are taking the same risk as people with gov't fiat in a gov't fiat bank.  But that risk does not exist if you keep control of your own money in your own wallets.

No. 50% per year will increase way too fast. 
Dude is against this protocol change but if it must be so, it should ramp up slowly, much like mining rewards ramp down slowly. 
Increasing the block size does not necessarily mean more transactions per block. It could also mean each transaction can include extra bloat (embedded data for example) and not solve the problem and create a new problem. 
This is why the protocol should not change now and certainly not change automatically wether or not demand is there.

It's not a dismal end. It's just that the party (rave) will be over soon as other countries will no longer need to hold dollars for trade with other countries. 
More and mir individual countries are now trading with their local currencies. Specifically, China and Russia are trading with other countries in Yuan and Ruble when they used to need USD. 
The less overseas dollars that are needed the more will simply return to the U.S.  When this happens, REAL inflation will set in. 
Prices of things will look similar to the "dollars in circulation" chart posted above in this thread by another user.

It took about 3 months after the last halving for price to significantly react. There was not big money behind mining back then. 
The price is either already calculated in, or the price will react a bit BEFORE the halving in anticipation. 
It's going to be fun, and the great part is less than 5 years to the next-next halving. Giddy, giddy, dude. 
It just absolutely makes me smile that by then we really will have a safe haven money that families can protect their wealth and easily participate in the global economy with!  Not that it's not posdible now, but now you're the weird kid. Hopefully by then, you'll be the weird kid if you aren't.

This makes complete sense. Way to go! Why wait so long?
For a gold exchanger using bitcoin is a no brainer. A bitcoin payment is non reversible. Same as once gold is in the mail; non reversible. 
Using electronic dollars, the honest seller is always taking a huge risk. Non reversible gold in the mail, reversible electronic dollar payment via the banking system (PayPal, SEPA, ACH, etc). 
This is why bitcoin has a strong future for global commerce.

@_date: 2014-04-06 13:15:27
What is visa, as the Dude seed it...
Visa is an archaic method from last century used to electronically transfer value from one entity to another. Often a person can "borrow" what is being transferred. 
This method of "borrow" creates value out of nowhere (eg thin air) and the "lender" gets to make a profit percentage off of what is "lent" without ever having to had have the original value to lend. 
Thankfully, this scam has been exposed and adoption is slowing as people learn about these scams. 
This is a stacked scene. The "lending" and "borrowing" are typically done with gov't fiat "money" which is sadly outdated and itself a scam and "created out if thin air" with no accountability of how much and at what rate it is created.

Removing data, charts, history etc. is not wise and Dude strongly disagrees to the OPs request.  It's like book burning, if you're into that sort of thing. 
If you do not need the information, do not look at it.  For historical reference and those people who still need the data, it is a disservice to remove the data and charts.
It's unfortunate that some sites have already removed data and charts.  I think they are bowing to crybaby requests instead of thinking intelligently about why they provide the data.  
Even if MtGox goes completely dead, the historical data and charts are still a valuable resource that should continue to be provided; albeit with no new data added if this happens.
Disclaimer: Dude has no money in any bitcoin exchanges.    Maybe this is why he can see that this cry for removal of data and charts is a complete overreaction!

Here generally sums up most economists view of what money is (from 
Quote: 
Almost any item, any asset, any "thing" can function as money so long as it is generally accepted as payment. In fact, a lot of different "things" have been used as money over the centuries--gold, silver, copper, nickel, animal skins, chocolate bars, cigarettes, precious gems, semi-precious gems, really precious gems, and assorted food products.
While a number of "things" have been used as money, some have worked better than others. Those "things" that did not work so well were replaced by other "things" that worked better. Those "things" that worked best tended to have four basic characteristics: (1) durability, (2) divisibility, (3) transportability, and (4) noncounterfeitability.

Interesting.  However, it is known what the inflation is.

Coinbase best for Americans in the current banking system to obtain bankless money. 
Bitpay best for helping merchants worldwide in the current banking system to use bankless money.

Likely, what happened to gold with GLD will happen to bitcoin with COIN.

It's probably safe. Least bad of a bunch of bad choices.  Bad closes being online wallet or vault providers. Eg. Someone else holding your bitcoins for you. 
With Bitcoin you don't need something like a bank to hold your money for you. We call Bitcoin "Bankless money". 
Make some secure offline paper wallets (bitcoinpaperwallet.com) and do it yourself. If Coinbase goes out of business you will then be unaffected.

Bitcoin is currently and will eat more into that market in the future. 
People who need gold the most are at the highest risk of their gov'ts actually stealing it from them or restricting travel with it. 
Bitcoin solves these problems when all you need to do to store wealth in bitcoin is have a brainwallet or remember a 12 word BIP39 mnemonic.

I guarantee you, given 10 years (such as you claim eBay had), decentralized, free marketplaces like OpenBazaar will work out at least as many issues as eBay has. 
Those first 10 years for eBay must have been hell (sarcasm). Those 10 years allowed them to become a huge marketplace!  Arguably eBay was much better. Dude never had any issues receiving quality goods when mailing Money Orders or Checks to the seller first. Dude easily sent more than 50 money orders in the early years - so I can easily say in a more free market making wise buying choices based on reputation has a high success rate.

We all have our separate beliefs, and this is Dude's. 
Tax on one's wages are the real crime. 100% tax on labor is called slavery. Less tax, is just partial slavery, I guess. 
Once that's done, wether you agree or not, when a bank decides to not give you access to your money that is called theft.

That means to me, keep doing it until people realize what's going on. Once someone realize those comments are actually money for them they will be even betwe advocates than we are.

I wouldn't call a centralized company with "reversible" money a free market. "Reversible" meaning either party can put holds or reverse payment (checks, PayPal, credit cards, etc). With money like that no real trust can be established. 
With a hard currency like Bitcoin and a non centralized free market ONLY trustworthiness and reputation of vendors will matter.  Customers will make wise decisions to buy from reputable vendors or risk their own money.   How the world really works, BTW.  
eBay is a place where you pay extra in exchange for trust and reputation.   You are, for example, switching your trust to eBay for a fee so that you don't need to trust the reputation of the merchant. 
Free markets will be cheaper. Approximately 13.5% cheaper than eBay. 
There will be no more disputes than on eBay. No one can say eBay provides a dispute free marketplace.

That's what is unfortunate. Dude generally likes and has recommended Blockchain.info wallet many times because things like this are suppose to not happen with their architecture and "hands off" of the private keys approach. 
Blockchain has done a great deal for our ecosystem and their non-wallet services can literally be called mission critical for more than likely 100's of other Bitcoin companies. 
In this day we all have better wallet solutions for every need. The blickchain wallet is becoming irrelevant even though Dude would still recommend it higher than any hosted wallets (circle, coinbase, coinapult, Chase, Wells Fargo, etc) where others hold your money for you. 
just a quick list:
Breadwallet on iOS. 
Mycelium and Wallet32 on Android. 
CoPay.io multisig on computers and phones. 
Trezor for ultimate usability and security. 
Paper wallets (or trezor bip39 12 word seed) for offline long-term storage.

Bitcoin certainly WILL become a better payment network than PayPal. 
PayPal simply does not serve enough places in the world. Many countries are simply blacklisted.
Fraud with PayPal is huge -- and not surprisingly, on the customer side. Because all it takes is a complain to PayPal and they give you your money back. Honest Merchants are being screwed daily by PayPal and thief customers.  Merchants are just waiting to jump on a new payment platform that does not have chargebacks.  Honest reviews and trust of merchants are all that is necessary to weed out good and bad merchants where real trust is created.

IIRC, since the last halving we have had 2 major bubbles that basically settled the price higher by a factor of 10.  
At this rate there is enough time for 2 more bubbles to happen before the next halving.  That does not mean that they will.
The next halving will, in case it's not obvious, halve the number of bitcoins being created.  Most, but not all, newly created bitcoins are sold for FIAT to cover expenses for large mining operations.
Alone, the next halving will likely make the price vs. Dollar rise by minimum of a factor of 2, but likely much more.  
The halving that comes in approximately 6 years will be one of the last major halvings at which time a very significant amount of the 21 million bitcions that can ever exist will be already mined.  At that point it will either be clear that Bitcoin is a significant world currency or not.
Obvious conclusions are being drawn now that as governments "print" their way out of problems there will be a not insignificant amount of people that opt-out monetarily to the largely US Dollar based system, at least for wealth preservation.  The Dollar system will not collapse like many doom sayers say-- but anyone trying to save wealth in US Dollars at that time will be equivalent to someone trying to save wealth in Argentinean Pesos today -- The Dollar will be a means of exchange and enough people will choose other assets to store wealth.  Bitcoin is clearly one of the easiest assets to store wealth in and almost the only one that can not be stolen from you by your Government, one way or another (artificial inflation, currency devaluation, etc).
Single digit Billion market cap for Bitcoin is where we are at today.  In the coming years expect that we will see triple digit Billion market caps.  At a minimumtriple digit Billion market caps will put the price of a single Bitcoin around $50,000 give or take.

Bitcoin is currently the most successful money in existence. All other current moneys, except gold, are in use by force. Bitcoin is in use by choice.

Bitcoin, like gold, will still be around even when governments change or go away. Best advice someone told me "if your gov't thinks you should not have a certain asset, then you probably should" and in this advice I'm thinking "free speech", "privacy - financial and otherwise", etc.

except for:
"When new lanes are added to a highway, they often fill up immediately, and traffic is back to the same state shortly after the improvement is made. The extra capacity draws more people to commute on the road, because it is faster. Businesses and homes spring up along the road, until the traffic becomes slightly intolerable. Then everything is back to the way it was before, in an equilibrium dictated by how much inconvenience with which people are willing to deal."
I disagree with the above snippet and I gave up reading after that.  
Using extra lanes in a highway or larger pipes for plumbing as an example does not mean we are back to the same thing once they fill up. It means we can now service more continuous drivers or more volumes of water and in Bitcoin's case more transactions per second on average.

Dude hates to correct you, but all Fed notes since 1971 have been counterfeit.

But even at that time they were printing more notes than gold. France figured this out and started exchanging their notes for gold. France exposed the U.S. and the U.S. quickly said dollars were no longer exchangeable. The U.S. dedaulted to all countries who had deposited gold with the U.S.

Bitcoin is better and worse than both other payment networks and other currencies.

Dude has sympathy.
However, any clone is going to happen regardless of the license.  Might I suggest, putting out a cheaper TREZOR lite (clone made by SatoshiLabs) but without the support (updates, etc). Similar to other clones, I assume.  If another firm can make money making clones, why can't you too?
People who are going to buy a knockoff would have never bought the TREZOR anyway.  Do remember that imitation is the best form of flattery. 
I'm of the other camp. I own 2 TREZORs and I would not buy a knockoff. 
What I'm securing is not worth putting in the hands of someone/something untrustworthy.
Changing the license like this starts to hint at the untrustworthiness of SatoshiLabs, regretfully.

Bitcoin is money similarly to how gold or silver are money with the advantage that Bitcoin is a fairly useful currency as well

I hope I'm not too blunt to be rude. Silly question, man. It depends on if you want to store and spend bitcoins safely (trezor) or just buy and sell bitcoins for dollars (coinbase). 
Apples and oranges, man. 
Trezor is the end all in secure Bitcoin wallets and works mobile too with android/mycelium. 
There is no good reason to let a bank (coinbase) hold your bitcoins for you unless you are actively trading. Do something else.

At the moment I would have to say my Bitcoin wallet is the only place i want my Bitcoin. 
If the LN becomes a thing then we can see. 
I'd love to use the LN and see if it is actually saving me fees after settling my transactions. It could be a winner but it's vapor ware until there is a working LN wallet. 
Perfect use case? If I can load up enough money for the year and my coffee shop works with LN then I should be saving some significant fees and since I'm the spender I won't be the one paying the fee to settle.  Is that right?

Believe it or not, this doesn't matter. 
VISA can be used to spend Dollars, Bitcoin, Euro and Gold products. If there were demand, I'm sure Visa could figure out how to spend copper and Brent crude oil. 
Point is, visa is not money but a system to transfer money (insecurely I might add) from one party to another. The receiving party can not be sure they are securely paid for over 90 days. 
Bitcoin on the other hand is money and is secure meaning the receiving party can be sure they are paid within one hour. 
Someday it will be more common that credit cards of the world add Bitcoin like they currently do major Gov't currencies, but those visa spent bitcoins will have the same problem as visa spent dollars meaning a 90 day clearing window for the receiving party. 
Let's not forget the 2.5% - 3% fee for a visa receiving party. 
To compare, Bitcoin can transfer value so much better. Approx. $0.01 - $0.20 and received securely in less than 1 hour.

Not exactly. 
It's when a signature is made, because the quantum computer can derive the private key from this. 
Modern Bitcoin wallets already are mostly safe from quantum computer attacks. If quantum computers were real wallets could enforce their spending rules with just a software update. 
Bitcoin itself does not need to change. But, it could change to make itself even more secure. Isn't Bitcoin amazing!? 
When quantum computers are real, it's funny how Bitcoin will basically be fine. Traditional online banking will be fucked with current banking security basically being only a TLS connected website.

This is the most centralized Bitcoin mining will ever be. 
Over the coming years ASIC efficiencies will be maxed out and will become commodity. 
When that happens then mining will slowly become more decentralized again as more and more individuals start again running mining hardware at home. 
The ASIC will eventually be as common as the GPU was for mining.
@_date: 2016-06-24 21:02:56
That's why Bitcoin is a sure thing. Because we are sure there is no way out of the central bank crisis without a default or continued devaluation of dollars, etc. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 10:28:20
Banks could simply adopt Bitcoin. People could have Bitcoin balances besides their dollar (or whatever) balance. They could loan Bitcoin, charge and pay interest, etc. 
Or just Un-invent dollar debasement. 
Whatever is easier.

USA is one of the least free places on earth. If you disagree you need to step back and learn who a real Patriot is. A real patriot stands up to the tyranical gov't that is out of control. A real patriot believes in freedoms for citizens not free-as-in-theft for police and gov't. 
It didn't used to be this way. If you are old enough and remember the good old days of the cop following you home because you drank too much, yes those were the good old days. This days don't exist anymore. Remember the past but don't be blind and think today is like it used to be.

- Bitcoin price in Dollars is still way more than a few weeks ago. 
- Bitcoin price in BTC is unchanged. 1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin. 
Only the later matters. 
When the halving happens 75% of all coins will be mined. The remaining 25% will take 100 plus years to mine. 
If you have dollars still, I highly recommend parting with them.

IMO, what's more important than the halving is due to this halving being the first inverse exponential halving. 
75% of all Bitcoin will be mined and it will take 100 plus years to mine the remaining 25%.
@_date: 2016-06-14 07:05:46
10% is what the article suggests. We should have approximately 700 Million people using Bitcoin to easily sway the whole world. 
Edit: this link was posted about a year ago. I thought it was worth thinking about again and see how far we've come since then.

Recently in historical perspective this really big problem started in 1913 and peaked in 1965 when the USA replaced actual precious metal silver money with worthless metal minted to look exactly the same but it's a historical problem that has happened many times when society agrees to use something as money that is created by the 1%. 
It alwYs ends bad except this time we can choose individually if it should end bad or not. 
This is the first time during a major financial wealth shift where everyone who would like to prepare themselves has the ability to. 
Historically gov'ts will ban and steal gold and silver from people and force them to use their new money. 
They can try with Bitcoin but because you can store your families wealth in just 12 words (what a fucking rad concept, btw) it is easily theft and coercion resistant.

Banks can "learn" from their past mistakes devaluing the the money they are responsible for creating or simply do nothing and be "replaced" with Bitcoin. 
Banks can do nothing about Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin will exist and persist regardless. A good question banks should ask themselves is if they wish themselves and their money to exist and persist?

Check the price in dollars from Dec. 2012. That's the last halving. 
The price in dollars has more than doubled since then.  Miners know what they are doing. 
They knew the halving in 2016 was coming since 2012. (One could argue they knew since 2009)

Breadwallet or CoPay. Personally I use Copay for my mobile wallet. 
With Copay on 2 devices (iPhone, iPad, computer, android) you can make a 2 of 2 wallet where you have to authorize payment from the other device. 
CoPay is quite awesome, actually. 
Edit. There is no more mycelium on iOS.
Edit 2: with CoPay you can have many wallets in the same app. Eg. One wallet could be normal (1 of 1) wallet for pocket money and a second wallet set up on the same app and another device as a 2 of 2 wallet which is your highly secure personal bank.

When you finally "open" it make sure you open it into a hardware wallet such as Trezor.

An example would be:
Copay.  
- Check the box in settings to spend unconfirmed. 
- put the fee rate on priority. 
- send all of your Bitcoin back to yourself. 
Can someone else explain how to do this in other popular wallets? Breadwallet. Mycelium. Etc.

The funny thing about risk..
A few years ago Bitcoin felt very risky, so risky that bumps in the market I would rather have dollars or actively make sure I had an easy way out of Bitcoin if needed. 
Risk has totally changed. I now believe it is much more risky to hold any significant wealth in a bank, much more risky than holding wealth in Bitcoin. With money printing out of control, governments officially bankrupt and going only deeper, banks collapsing nearly daily and major global banks only a stone throw away from collapsing, Bitcoin, naturally when kept in your own wallet, seems like one of the least risky places to store wealth in this new fucked up financial bubble we are in.

But bitcoin is always frictionless, where as credit cards can sometimes be frictionless.
We then move into a more trustworthy society. Market forces will naturally weed out bad merchants with review sites and scores and we won't need gate keepers such as visa or MC to offer our money back if we are not happy. Good merchants will thrive by offering good service. Bad merchants will go out of business. Credit cards offer bad merchants the ability to stay in business.

Using Bitcoin, rather, spending Bitcoin is such a joy especially when the merchant is selling a digital service and all you want is their item and all they want is your money. 
Bitcoin is much easier than using credit cards which are nearly impossible to use easily for digital services because practically everything is flagged as fraud. 
It took dude over 5 days to buy some discount gift cards online using credit cards and I wished those merchants took Bitcoin. 2 out of the three businesses would not accept my credit card orders and the third I had to speak with on the phone to prove I am who my credit car says I am.

However, normal transactions are not illegal. For example selling a stick of gum, or a service such as a hug or handshake is still legal (assuming some license for those are not needed). If the buyer does not have the exact amount, you could certainly provide change.

This thread is great. I'll be coming back later to read the next batch of comments. 
The answer is always no and always delete your BTC wallets before traveling. If you can remember 12 words you can spend any amount of BTC safely without varying anything. 
I'm looking forward to more police state shenanigans. If we resist long enough maybe the police state will go away.

Bitcoin has the ability to actually help normal people and let anyone participate in the Global economy not to mention help to expose the fraud of their gov'ts who are managing people's wealth for them by devaluing their national currencies almost across the board (Liberland is the exception since their national currency is Bitcoin).

Apple has a payment system that electronically sends money. Bitcoin is money. Apple could add another money, such as Bitcoin, if they wish.

CPFP sounds good. Full replace by fee does not.
I hope full RBF is is not interesting to anyone to actually include it.
I see Peter Todd's (is that right) thoughts that no one should trust a zero conf, but right now the risk is manageable for those do (like selling a bagel or something).. However full RBF as you describe it seems like a major train wreck.  and CPFP does not sound like a bad thing at all.  Recipients can up the fee if they want their confirmation faster which is nice that the sender doesn't always have to pay for it all.

@_date: 2016-09-04 22:06:53
zero confirmation is totally a manageable risk, man.  Every seller of something can make that choice for themselves.
If bagel shop can sell more bagels taking only a zero confirmation, they know their risk of "chargebacks" and can take the risk.
Making zero conf absolutely easy for people to replace a transaction in the mempool is just reckless.
Safe or not-safe are not words someone should use to describe someone else's business that they don't understand.  What is safe for my business is none of your business, so to speak. :)

Cash generally does not have this problem, as you point out. Cash can be used to buy anything cash can buy, there is no check to see if it were previously used for something shady. Monero does not have this problem, it solves the problem by not having a record that can publicly be obtained from transaction to transaction. Bitcoin now has this problem - as I point out running a waffle business.

This would help with small businesses accepting bitcoin not for tax reasons but for individuals wishing to spend money but not doing it because the IRS reporting burden is too great. 
If this passes then we can buy lunch, coffee, pay small contractors, etc without first thinking where do I record this value to later report it to the IRS. 
This could allow some actual innovation to happen in America. Because of this, chances of it becoming a law are very low 
People should start calling their congressmen/women and saying they want this to pass and give them your thoughts as to why it is a good idea. 
Edit: someone with political type skills have any idea of a portal to set up to collect comments or help people find the right Congress people to call?
Currently it’s absolutely burdensome. Someone buys bitcoin yesterday and spends it today must most likely file that transaction and it’s gain/loss on their 1040. Much too complicated. That’s why so many people don’t do it and or don’t file. And that’s why so many may be in violation because they don’t even know they should file.

No im not sure.  But my point, which I am sure is that different parts of the US Gov't clearly are not agreeing about what they are doing.  It's just a game anyway, they just don't get that whatever they do it doesn't matter.   
It is unbelievable to me now how a number (not even math at this point) we are just talking about a number, here can be regulated, or even is suggested that it be regulated... I lost my train of thought here...

I second getting a Trezor. You can use it on android with mycelium and on computers with electrum, copay or the mytrezor wallet.

Generally I agree. Where I live real estate has no tax so it is a real asset. 
Many countries tax real estate, often yearly. Over time this majorly erodes the value. In a life time some one spends almost twice on the property and worst case if you can't pay the tax your property is taken from you. It's certainly not true wealth that can be passed down over generations in this case (like gold, silver or Bitcoin are)
My point is if your country or state taxs real estate, then real estate caries the equivilant to counterparty risk.

Sorry, at the moment for about a dollar's worth of Bitcoin only about a billion dollars worth could be sent in a single transaction assuming the top 10-20 or so richest addresses are the same person.

Not true. Dude is the most full retard of them all but I don't wish my fate good or ill on someone else as investment advise. 
But when you stop and think about how much the dollar will devalue on another 20 years it makes you think hard about what "alternative" asset classes someone should store wealth in. 
My non-retard advise of the day is this:
- 45% gold bullion
- 5% silver bullion
- 45% Bitcoin
- 5% Monero 
I second getting a Trezor. The crypto steel is unnessesary, but nice. There are plenty of easy and safe ways to store 12 words safely and redundantly. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 19:10:11
 The real question is this:
Is "stealing" a number actually a theft?  Talking about a number... a number that could be a private key to anything, but it's still only a number. 
Aren't numbers all in the public domain, since like fucking forever, man?
Edit: theft from an exchange is not the same thing as theft of bitcoins. In this case he's got a better chance of an actual case.

Bitcoin, or any money, doesn't double.

@_date: 2016-10-22 09:22:35
Let me know what your bank charges for a transfer of $6.4 million to someone in another country that uses a different currency. 
- Did it happen in 10-20 minutes?
- Did your bank ask you where you got $6.4 million?
- After your bank investigates you for money laundering (which certainly you didn't do) they close your account anyway because you are a high risk?
- Why the fucking questions from a bank?
- Bitcoin does not ask questions. Fees or no fees, doesn't matter. Not having a counterparty risk is the point!
Edit: banks are making themselves obsolete.

If you have paper and pen, a smartphone and a computer I recommend a 2 of 2 Copay wallet (copay on the smartphone and copay on the computer).  One must sign the others transactions.  The paper and pen are to back up the 12 word keys for each wallet.

I like the idea of if TBF then an incoming wallet or payment processor would show a warning - do not trust this until it is confirmed.

IMHO, there are really only 2 great wallets with security first and foremost in mind on iOS, Breadwallet and Copay. 
I personally use Copay as a 2 of 2 wallet with my phone and laptop. I can create a transaction on either the phone or computer and "approve" payment on the other. 
Copay is great! They just need to add an advanced menu item for zero fees so that we can move our own funds around at a slow speed without paying fees (like any other decent wallet can do)

PS. I'm not quite following you here.  In a year (for example) litecoin will have approximately 210000 confirmations on top of a 1 year old block. In a year, Bitcoin will have approximately 52000 confirmations on top of a one year old block.   
Litecoin is 4 times faster in theory, I see maybe you're saying the confirmation is 4 times weaker. That's fine.  But, what I like is many places take a litecoin deposit on 1 confirmations and so do many bitcoin places.  When it comes down to how long I (as in, my time) have to wait, litecoin wastes less of my time.

A 12 Word seed from a HD Bitcoin wallet such as Copay or Breadwallet is a very great brain wallet for people that can remember 12 words in the right order. 
As for the old style brainwallet. I made one and it's got over 5 Bitcoin in it since 2013. Like others have said. It's not the technology that is good or bad it's how large and how random of a thing you can remember. 
For example, a brain wallet with the password of the first 3000 digits of PI would be a horrible password. But a decently long phrase of your own with some of your own numbers to remember padded with the 3000 digits of PI is probably good enough to be safe.

Use Copay!
You can have ultra secure 2of2 (for example) wallets which can easily be used. 
Smaller amounts can go in a normal Copay wallet. 
You can have multiple wallets in one app. 
If you want Fort Knox, get a Trezor. It's also possible to use Trezor on android but if you're paying at a shop it's not exactly elegant. 
Don't put more on your phone than you are willing to loose. Put whatever you want safe on Trezor. Using Copay and Trezor is Kind of like a checking account and a Swiss bank account - only Trezor is safer than a Swiss bank account.

There just doesn't seem to be any good wallets I can use Eth with my trezor - and so, I haven't even bothered to mess with eth as a coin, let alone as a virtual machine, et. al.
My use case (money) doesn't lend well to Eth since it's mining rewards never decrease and never end. I need a decent assumption of a store of value.

Aaron. I like Breadwallet  I know how much time you spend to make it secure and easy to use. Kudos!
I don't use Breadwallet because I don't want to have to trust you. 
Instead I use Copay as a 2of2 wallet and have a handy second device that I use as the 2nd factor (so to speak) before my transaction is sent. 
I would love to see Breadwallet go in the direction of multisig and have a second app maybe on the same phone and/or on another device as the second signature 
I know it's a lot of work and Copay already does all this. 
If I had to store 1000 BTC on a phone, I would have to choose Copay because then I DONT have to trust anyone - I can rely on knowing I don't need to. 
Whoever has 1000 bitcoins should already have a Trezor. 
Edit: I might even use Breadwallet occasionally for pocket money if I could change the units to BTC. My brain does not think in bits.

That's the "problem" with a good means of exchange (eg. Money). Money can be used to transact.

Trezor team will quickly point out iOS doesn't allow access to the USB properly. I'm quick to point out that Trezor had a screen and ability to create QR codes and that an iPhone app can easily scan and do whatever it wants with a code. 
To be clear. Paint out the signed transaction across one or more QR codes and have an app scan and broadcast it. 
Obviously it's not that simple. But it's a place to start thinking around the limitations of iOS.

EU explores account freezes to prevent runs at failing banks
Francesco Guarascio
European Central Bank (ECB) headquarters building is seen in Frankfurt, Germany July 20, 2017.
Ralph Orlowski
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union states are considering measures which would allow them to temporarily stop people withdrawing money from their accounts to prevent bank runs, an EU document reviewed by Reuters revealed.
The move is aimed at helping rescue lenders that are deemed failing or likely to fail, but critics say it could hit confidence and might even hasten withdrawals at the first rumors of a bank being in trouble.
The proposal, which has been in the works since the beginning of this year, comes less than two months after a run on deposits at Banco Popular contributed to the collapse of the Spanish lender.
It also come amid a bitter wrangle among European countries over how to deal with troubled banks, roughly a decade after a financial crash that required the European Central Bank to print billions of euros to prevent a prolonged economic slump.
Giving supervisors the power to temporarily block bank accounts at ailing lenders is "a feasible option," a paper prepared by the Estonian presidency of the EU said, acknowledging that member states were divided on the issue.
EU countries which already allow a moratorium on bank payouts in insolvency procedures at national level, like Germany, support the measure, officials said.
"The desire is to prevent a bank run, so that when a bank is in a critical situation it is not pushed over the edge," a person familiar with German government's thinking said.
To cover for savers' immediate financial needs, the Estonian paper, dated July 10, recommended the introduction of a mechanism that could allow depositors to withdraw "at least a limited amount of funds."
Banks, though, say it would discourage saving.
"We strongly believe that this would incentivize depositors to run from a bank at an early stage," Charlie Bannister of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), a banking lobby group, said.
The Estonian proposal was discussed by EU envoys on July 13 but no decision was made, an EU official said. Discussions were due to continue in September. Approval of EU lawmakers would be required for any final decision.
Insured Deposits
The plan, if agreed, would contrast with legislative proposals made by the European Commission in November that aimed to strengthen supervisors' powers to suspend withdrawals, but excluded from the moratorium insured depositors, which under EU rules are those below 100,000 euros ($117,000).
Under the plan discussed by EU states, pay-outs could be suspended for five working days and the block could be extended to a maximum of 20 days in exceptional circumstances, the Estonian document said.
Existing EU rules allow a two-day suspension of some payouts by failing banks, but the moratorium does not include deposits.
The Commission, which declined to comment on the discussion, had previously excluded insured deposits from the scope of the moratorium tool fearing it "may have a negative impact on market confidence," according to a press release published in November.
Many states supported a suspension of payouts only during the so-called resolution of a failing bank - the process which imposes losses on lenders' investors and possibly also uninsured depositors, while preserving the continuity of the banking activities, the document said.
Most countries opposed bolder plans for an early moratorium.

A typical home computer from 2009 is more powerful than a raspberry pi. That was part of his point. 
A 2017 $150 laptop is more than enough to help support a node in 2017. 
His other point was if you are now rich because of Bitcoin, stop complaining and put some money back into supporting the network. 
Granted he is rough around the edges, but he's also Aussie so it's not as rough as it seems. 
But he's right. Nobody should be crying that they can't run a full node on a small embedded arm device when even Satoshi was using a decent home computer.

Buyanywhere. 
Store in a multisig Copay/Bitpay wallet for security of your big stash. Alternatively buy a Trezor or Ledger Nano S. 
For daily, walk around money use Breadwallet or a non-multisig copay/bitpay wallet. 
Fees might be a bit cheaper with wallets that use traditional addresses (Trezor, Ledger, Breadwallet)
Bitpay/CoPay wallets use P2SH which makes transactions a tiny bit bigger so they have potentially larger fee because fees are typically computed based on transaction size.

Noticed in a bank in Austria there is a 3000€ daily withdraw limit. Not talking about ATM, I mean you're limited to that in person in a branch. 
It's getting fucked up when a person is not allowed to withdraw the money they thought was theirs / and there in lies the problem. 
Edit: however, you can empty your entire account and walk out of the bank with gold bullion - 
Edit2: or at least take your €3000 per day to the post office and buy Bitcoin.

Speaking of hardfork vs. softfork. We have hard forked Bitcoin many times successfully. We have also softforked Bitcoin successfully too. 
In general hardforking is cleaner than softforking and requires less code that is the "hack" (not a bad word in this sense) to maintain after the fork. Softforking leaves crud in the code that we have to keep in mind and deal with later that causes more potential for future problems.

Well, I do know. Sorry to disappoint you. At Bitcoin scale, Lightning is going to have similar issues. Is lightning somehow immune from scale?
I'm not saying don't do Lightning, I'm saying if Lightning becomes what is important then running on Bitcoin will no longer matter. We could just git commit to github and the world could police that nobody is changing anything - for example or any other such solution. 
But if we want Bitcoin to be the important part of Bitcoin than we must release the strangle hold.

Asicboost is not the point. It is because of 2 things
- blockstream must allow or grant an unlimited/unrestricted patent use (SegWit is patented) - for example so blickstream doesn't go around suing wallet software makers or companies generating transactions via API's

Why does anyone care about visa's TPS. Visa will someday issue cards denominated in BTC, just as they do now for USD, EUR, etc. 
TPS of cash is what is important. Bitcoin is digital cash, not a visa-like transaction that can roll back for up to 90 days. 
Unfortunately I have no idea if Bitcoin is in the ballpark of cash TPS but cash transactions have been going down for years and will continue to do so. Bitcoin transactions per second will continue to rise one way or another. Eventually there will be an intersection though we might not know it. 
What am I blathering about, I'll tell you what I'm blathering about. 
Visa transactions per second don't matter because visa transactions per second are not final (remember 90 days for payment to be permanent). This still makes Bitcoin look pretty awesom even during these stressful times. We are here because of the FED, the ECB, BoE, etc - not Visa. 
When we work through this mess just remember visa is a payment network that may well offer 90 day reversible Bitcoin denominated transactions in the future - and that's cool. Visa can be a tool for us too.

Any Crypto adoption is good for Bitcoin, man. 
It's best to support Ethereum because they are doing a great job on boarding for Bitcoin since currently Bitcoin on boarding is due to financial needs only (i.e. Random ware, preserving your wealth from hostile nation-states, etc).

Visa will add Bitcoin as a currency eventually. Visa already transfers balances between two parties for these other monies: USD, Yen, GBP, Euro, CHF, and probably a dozen more or more.

Dollars/tether is guaranteed to loose purchasing power over time. 
Bitcoin on the other hand has a huge risk/reward potential for gaining purchasing power. 
I too am interested in tether and I don't know much about it. 
Can anyone ELI5 tether?

Dude generally thinks Kevin Rose is an okay guy, and decisively cool with the Internets, but he seems like a hypocrite when it comes to Bitcoin. 
Kevin is only a true believer today. A few weeks ago he certainly was not. We will see how he feels in 3 more weeks. 
Flip! Flop!
Sorry Kevin.

Giving away money is not a good way to show something has value.

Agree to disagree man. 
I'm not asking for a flight on an Army transport or Air Force 1. Airlines are businesses and it's up to them, or should be.

Shitty books don't sell well nor do they get checked out of the library often. 
Please check out Cory Doctorow. 
He gives away his books. They are good. They tell their friends. People choose to buy them anyway, because they are good. . Cycle repeats.

Order a Trezor or Ledger nano s first. 
Keep your Bitcoin in your own bank, so to speak. 
Probably the best way to save wealth given global central bank plans.

You mean like 'Murcia where selling Bitcoin on local Bitcoin sends you to jail. Fucking freedom, man.

In the USA in the 1950's it was reasonable and common to buy a cup of coffee for a 90% silver $0.10 coin. Silver is no longer cheap enough to measure a coffee, you would be talking silver dust. 
Unfortunately like silver Bitcoin is also becoming too valuable for small transactions.

I just read a few days ago coinbase lost, I think it was, $200000 bank transfer from someone wanting to buy Bitcoin. 
It was on Reddit.

Willipa_prime, you are right and I'm glad I'm wrong. I tried it in a new browser, presumably and to delete the second password, you need to enter the second password.
This is what I thought, but was shocked when in a current browser, it did not prompt for second password.
Take-n-r easy.

One could open with Internet Archive Federal Credit Union. 
They will surely not close your account for bitcoin activity, they are actively seeking it.

Dear Mt.Gox team,
Taking one for the team is deeply appreciated. Honestly Mt.Gox needs to continue to be this transparent but in a more timely matter. 
Mt.Gox taking one for the bitcoin team means you all are earning those battle scars early that will pay dividends (the karma kind) to Mt.Gox in the future with regards to customer trust and when push comes to shove these kind of past issues will give future bitcoin-ers trust in Mt.Gox as well. 
Keep up the good work. 
Take it easy,
The Dude.
@_date: 2013-07-16 22:34:30
Yes. Dude was able to withdraw more bitcoins than were in his account many times just by pressing submit again. It was wonderful. 
However I guess someone noticed and that feature does not work anymore. 
All dude ever wanted was his rug back.

Dude is not a tax lawyer, but I would think if you have income from bitcoin-&gt;USD and you are a tax slave then you probably should pay.
Dude can't remember. Is this slave tax for our freedom?
@_date: 2013-06-29 15:27:16
Sorry, I think that is the vendors responsibility to collect sales tax… build it into the price if they wish. 
As for federal capital gains taxes, first there must be capital gains. Of course I will pay if the law says so!  
DHS has 7 bullets for every single American skull. Refuse to be robbed by the IRS and those 7 bullets may find your head. Makes it worse that I f-ing paid for those f-ing bullets with my sweat and blood, and on credit to my great grandchildren!  
I don't remember being asked to be born into slavery, but I guess that's how it goes with slavery. If we had a safe choice we would chose to not be slaves.

Not a good idea. Every time you encrypt with PGP/GPG, the output is different.  
However, you could choose a one-way-hash (sha256 for example) and do that instead. It would be fine.

First, I hope you get your money back from those scoundrels. 
Second, banks are scoundrels. That is why for wealth we do not want confiscated, we have bitcoin. 
People have commonly been saying "don't put more wealth into bitcoin than you can afford to loose", but Dude thinks the opposite. Don't leave wealth in national currencies (worse if it's in a bank) than you can afford to loose.
