But here are also reasons why decisions like this require a pre defined "big majority" to be binding. 
In most countries you won't change the constitution with a 50%+1 of votes ... Structural things require more than that.
And sure you can't call it the will of the people. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:12:51
52% of the users is hardly consensus

I can't stand this "signaling" bullshit anymore. Run the code or is just a joke. 
Are 90% of miners and other allegedly supporting businesses running this code ?
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:09:17
Uasf is the only reason why nya exists. Circular argument, speculating what uasf would have been is pointless.
The only thing that matter is reality, reality is that we are getting segwit.
If they really want the 2x part to work they need to get wide support , miners and business are not enough and if that is the route they choose we will inetivabily end up with yet another minority coin similar to bcash. Or even worst 3 minority bitcoin versions competing for the same userbase.
For me is very simple , if they want the fork they have to get the support of users like me , sure we are not 100% of the userbase but I am convinced we are more then the 10% some people like to think when they mention the support that 2x allegedly has.

Consensus seems to mean something different to everyone depending on what their position is . 
Does it mean "everyone" ? Does it mean 2/3 ? Does it mean who has more mining power ? Does it mean who has the "coding power" so to speak ?
Every side is able to show how the ecosystem would be useless without them. 
I am a user, what s bitcoin value if there are no users ?
But what is it without miners ? Or businesses/tools ?
So I stand for full consensus, to the point where if there is a minority left, there is always a minority left, is small enough to not matter. 
Interestingly this is not the case, at least for now, on the bcash side. They do matter at 350$ or so
I stand for full consensus , if you want a change you need to bring the whole ecosystem with you and if you can't then maybe your change is not as good as it seems to you. 
I hear those that say that this way there will never be a change but that is not true, we did change as a whole many times over and segwit is just the last example of it.
If there is no support for a change then that change does not have to happen.
Otherwise let s revert to the "old rules". Stop this signaling joke and everybody run the code they like and let s see where the consensus is, also let s see which code does actually work ... I would rather have that then the crazy list of supported changes you can see nowadays in the coinbase of mined blocks.
This is , I feel almost embarrassed in saying it, something I like about bcash. After so many threats and signaling they are finally running the code that they want. Kudos for that.
I feel that we need to go forward all at once , if one of the four (I thought it was five but does not really matter) component is not on board than the change ought not to be. 
Status quo is the only consensus we can measure. 
Code is the only other consensus we can measure.
Agreements between limited parties in closed rooms excluding those you don't like are definitely not consensus , regardless of your definition of it.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:05:28
Indeed that's all that matters, block will come and code will define consensus, the only one that really matters. 
At the moment the sites I know show 162 nodes running btc1 , if that is 90% of the network that makes the decisions then this is not the network I like and fair enough I should be the one moving on.

1) This is a system that is based and designed on third party. That s what makes it decentralized. The way to do that is with economic incentives. 
Seems like so far the incentives to move to to segwit has only managed to get 10%ish ( depending on the day you look ) of transactions. 
Users should make this happen ... If your service, your wallet , your whatever don't support it yet then change them for those that already do support it. In this case the users are the economic incentives.
2) good software development take time. Upgrading a network like this require careful planning.
If anyone can do it faster while keeping the same quality then please do it.
If not though then just shut up and let the developers put the quality work required. 
Whenever I hear of those "[insert date] is too late" I feel like I am back at my daily job ... 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:08:39
Hardly the same proposition. Just more transactions in a single block. 
We don't know if cryptos at all will be around in five years. Welcome to the ride.
That is the whole point. We don't need a new PayPal we need a revolution. But if all you need to make your life better  are more transactions in a block then please do look for that. Plenty of options out there giving you that.
Technical edge , censorship resistant , satellite based network though , not so common in those other 1300 coins out in the wild ... Faster blocks and bigger blocks, plenty. All you need is a couple changes in the code.
 That is what makes the difference for me.

Which , regardless of spec, is called bitcoin. No need to rename
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:30:42
I buy bitcoin because I expect the adoption to grow. The price rise is a secondary effect because of that.

There are so many options out there ... Why do you stick to btc if you don't like it ? 
Bch is just one of them , but coinmarketcap has something like 1300 of them listed ! Take your pick
Btc has a clear vision. L2 and beyond ... Use your time wisely instead of complaining and fudding

This. Is not that hard.
If your proposal is good, if your SOFTWARE is good , if people run it then you have consensus.
You have 200 nodes and a bunch of was instances you don't have consensus regardless how many meetings you manage to organize

How does a checkpoint actually work ? 
Is it some sort of agreement between miners (and nodes?) to checkpoint at block XYZ and everybody run a command in the same 10 minutes window ? 
What happens if "some miners" are out of sync on their checkpoint command , do we end up with 3+ chains ? 
Genuine question, loved your post since it helps me understand  
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:11:12

I am still bit confused by this replay attack think.
Let s say I have coins in private key 1 and send bcc to address/private key 2 , which I control. 
Does not that mean that a replay attack on my btc would cause the same amount of btc coin to go to the same address on the btc chain for which I still control the private key ? Sure not what I intended to do but I still have those coins. 
I feel like I am missing something here

Who control the supply and inflation of coins in the network ?
Is my understanding , maybe wrong, that the initial ico was for a limited amount of coins. 
This is an important point to me when talking  cryptocurrencies, if the inflation and control of it is not just based on math is not really something I want to have anything to do with regardless of how great the technology is.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:02:54
The reason why this team is considered the relevant one is because of the code, the quality of the code, they release and not because of the individuals in it. 
Anyone is welcome to produce a better code , and will , only at that point, become the most relevant one. 
I still have to see this happening though, and especially some of the people you mention haven been doing more crying and bitching than coding. 
I want the best team at any time, the best and tested code at anytime , regardless where it come from. 
Once again, the team , not the core team specifically but the team as a concept, produce code. The individuals bitch when they get bamboozled and sell and go work for banks when they think btc is dead. To each one his own

There are several networks in the work, some probably more trustless than others. 
Lightning is quite trustless , and with demand it will be even more if possible.
Mentioning blockstream in such a context is just fud. Don't want to use their implementation, use another one ... Or use cross chain atomic swap. 
There are millions solutions in front of us and instead we get stuck with just "I need bigger blocks" , which is such a cheap one 
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:52:11
That's quite a simplification. The structure of linux code maintenance (Given its size probably) is more complex than that and has many [Mantainers]( , each responsible (and trusted) for their own area. Very similar to the "council of elders" you mention. 
Is a Bazaar and that is very very different from your [Cathedral]( description of the Linux Project.
See 






Linus has currently a role much closer to the "release manager" than to a "leader"
Linux is the **Best example of how an open source project should be run**, and is indeed the metric against which any open source project should , and does, measure itself when it comes to management of the code. 
It defined, and defines, what working in an decentralized project means, with [hundreds of different companies]( and [thousands]( of individual contributors working toward the same goal while pulling the project in all different directions (from a rasperry pi to the ISS , passing by bilions of phones) 
I do understand how difficult it is to apply such an approach to bitcoin is given the financial nature of the project, but when i see shit thrown against the very same developers that gave us the code we run today and have been running all the way to get us here i get sad (not implying you are saying that, just venting)
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:23:40


This is to me the most important, and horribly overlooked, point in the whole discussion.
Let's never forget that we have a team of developers with the **indisputable longest and proven experience** in the space. 
A team of developers that gave us the Bitcoin protocol we have today, a piece of software that seem to have come from the future for how incredibly [resilient and reliable it is](
To whoever want to take over all i can say is **good luck**, because you have to be better than that and it won't be an [easy task](

I really hate this common "satoshi meant", or "satoshi vision" statements. 
The present is very different from what even him could have predicted.
Nobody knows what he would think right now and bringing up what "we say he thought" at the start of the journey is pointless.
Also , hear this... He could even be, and have been, wrong. He, as everybody else, was not perfect. I don't believe in God and I don't like this "religion of satoshi" thing.
We already changed a lot of the code he delivered, if we had to stick with only what he did we would hardly have the size of network we have now.
The present, and the future, offer millions of opportunity. Block size increase is, at best, one that is stuck in 8 years ago time, the past
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:22:54
I talk about the team, individuals are fallible while the team is reliable. Individuals can die or disappear, the team is forever. The team is a pot of knowledge that can be passed from generation to generation , while individuals can be easily bamboozled. Respect the team , ignore the individuals
