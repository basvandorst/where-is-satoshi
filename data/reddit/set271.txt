Warren Buffett also admitted to completely missing the boat on early investing in Amazon and Google. He admitted not understanding tech companies. Anyways, crypto is about out with the old, iin with the new.

I agree with you 30%. I just strongly disageee with the narrative that Trump is pushing that the poor and immigrants that are tearing this nation apart. Banks, using fractional reserve accounting, are enticing everyone to take on loans for anything they do in life...college, auto, mortgage, etc. Banks have practicaly taught society to do this as a standard practice. And most every American is in massive debt, only able to pay off the compounding interest on their loans, with money lent to them which the banks never had to begin with. Banks are simply printing endless dollars backed by no gold. Meanwhile, the rich keep getting richer and the disparity of wealth is rising to disproportionate levels. This crazy financial system is due for a windfall.
That said, yes, no one put a gun to anyone's  head to take out these loans, and yes, many take advantage by lying on applications to get loans they cannot afford. But for the majority of Americans, these bad decisions are due to a lack of financial acuity. So many kids believe in getting a college education, and are suckered into taking out loans, only to find out there are no jobs available in the degree they graduated in. I don't see how anyone can blame kids for believing they were doing the right thing to get ahead in life.
Reminds me of when Arnold Schwarzenegger became Governor of California, declaring to fix the state budget. Economists pulled him aside and explained, how are you going to balance the budget when the average Californian makes $40,000 a year, but spends $70,000? 
Ultimately, I blame the guys at top...our current and past presidents, our senators and congressmen, and our banking leaders for not instituting change to this rigged, double spend financial system that is due to fail. And like Gordon Gecko said in Wall Street 2, "the next one, that will be the big one."
P.S. I recommend investing in Gold and Crypto.

Buffet's comments are very disappointing, but when I think about it, I don't blame him given he's been the top beneficiary of the very economy Bitcoin/crypto attacks. He's too old to change and has this old school mentality that the current system is running just fine.  And why should he otherwise given he's made billions from it? I still like Buffet, but I do NOT believe for one second he doesn't understand cryotocurrencies and their inherent value. He's simply spreading massive FUD because it directly threatens his very own system of creating wealth. But also, I do NOT believe for one second that he doesn't own any Bitcoin...maybe he's not directly trading it, but someone at Berkshire quietly is for him.

So Buffett was against Bitcoin, and said he didn't see any value in it. And yet, later in the conversation, Buffett admitted to missing out on being an early bird investor on two tech companies: Amazon and Google.  Buffett admitted he didn't understand them as tech companies, so he never bothered investing in them even though he saw the numbers they were doing.  That just tells me he doesn't understand anything about Bitcoin.

Everyone should simply question Jamie Dimon's credibility, as well as the system which he protects.

Don't listen Goldman Sachs, they are so limited in their thinking and manipulative in their false determinations (i.e. selling AAA rated Mortgage Back Securities). Crypto is about out with the old, in with the new (as with any technology). The rules of finance are being completely rewritten.  In one of Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao's keynote addresses, he stated he believed that in the future, there will be many token economies, thus millions of coins. I believe this to be true.  Here's a video jumpcut to his statement: 
 
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:25:26
Well, crypto is in a bear market and is pretty darn boring.  But considering world events and rising tensions, I still HODL strong.  All it takes is one event to throw off world economies and put us into a recession worse than 2008.  And next time that happens, there will be no bail out as there will be no money left to bail anyone out. There is no Plan A.  USD continues to decrease in value, US Deficit keeps rising...HODL strong to your Crypto.  GLTA

With the USD losing its value and the FEDs pumping cash not backed by any gold, people will look to store their wealth elsewhere.  Problem with Gold is, how do you lug it around and safely secure it if you have a substantial amount?  Crypto solves this these problems and could be, I believe, where people mad stash their wealth when the economy tanks. People are losing faith in government and I don't believe they'll be by buying T bonds. But I'm not a time traveler and could be wrong.
