Love reading about the Pineapple fund. Everyone would like to think that if they were rich they'd try to change the world, but it seems like few people actually make the effort.

Good, we need more competition. Coinbase is an objectively terrible platform.

I bought $3k BTC/LTC @ $17k but I converted it all to Monero a week later when I received it. Still hurts though as Monero has taken a mighty plunge as well.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:55:06
Hopefully they converted to fiat quickly
