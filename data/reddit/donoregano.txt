That said, I think Bitcoin will start getting compromised on the level of the individual user. It will start with people who use simple passwords (you might as well use no encryption at all) and then it will expand to others who fall for phishing attacks, and so on. I'm sure hackers will come up with other ingenious schemes, because Bitcoin users are going to be a huge target.
Just saying... :-)

Ehm, I think "awesome" may be the wrong word to use to describe the economic collapse of another country...
(I do understand that you mean it would be awesome for Bitcoin, but it would be bloody terrible for a huge number of people!)

History of BTC maybe, not history of all investments over the history of mankind...

If Trump wins we'll get a third world war and I'll need all the alternate currency I can get. Then again, will Bitcoin work in a postapocalyptic world. Did they use digital currency in Mad Max: Fury Road? I forget...
(Ok, my scenario for third world war, as a Swede. Trump drops out of Nato, Putin annexes the Baltic states and some other strategic parts of Europe (like Gotland, the fixed aircraft carrier of the baltic sea), Trump gets hysterical, nukes Russia. Putin nukes back.)

Yeah, that sounds just like him...

The Pax is not as stupid as he pretends to be. In fact he is drawing out all of Bowie's best arguments in this interview, and I would say he is doing it consciously.

More Paxman for those who don't know him:
