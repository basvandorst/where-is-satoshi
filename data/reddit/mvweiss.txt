ive bought BTC and things with BTC from them.
they love supporting BTC transactions. Maybe you guys can figure sdomething togethetr as tghey are national.
@_date: 2017-01-22 01:46:07
Why don't you try Localbitcoin, also I saw another marketplace with sellers offering bitcoin..... AllArk or something.
I have traded on both and experiences were good.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:12:01
Thanks kind bro, just tryna keep it real ;D
@_date: 2017-01-21 16:47:04
Wow, they really hope it fails so they don't "feel bad" ? 
That's just weak sauce right there, i've lost money in BTC and in Apple stocks doesn't mean Apple is going to fail. Upvoted for the explanation.
@_date: 2017-01-21 16:43:41
What do you mean? Not feeding anyone over there but what is the real world example in history for such unrelenting stupidity. Maybe the invention of Cars? It just seems at this point that they are continuing out of spite.

I would be a perennial HODLers but i feel that's such a miserly thing to be, Scrooge McDuck. Swimming in his pool of Bitcoin while never spending any and living the poverty life.
I could HODL till i'm dead but i'd rather have fun spending it while alive.
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:56:55
I will buy you a $5 pizza from 7-11 for $4 of Bitcoin in the US. lol Just so i can say 7-11 accepts bitcoin here as well.
I'll eat the pizza i buy you for an extra $0.50 in BTC ;-)
Address : 1DuSiXMdAFN7pckJ2mYymnYa3x8CrBjg3H
I will even post pictures if someone actually does this.
You know what I'm gonna lose money (and might donate to homeless) but it might actually convince 7-11 about BTC if enough people are interested.
@_date: 2017-01-21 23:47:55
Lol is that a fact. Guess they gonna do what they gonna do.
@_date: 2017-01-25 00:07:18
Keep on keepin on bro. Im planning to head to Cali sometime, if i get time off my business, be happy to check out your farm.
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:34:37
You seem to make good points, most of the posts I've seen are just ridiculing BTC, sure every project has issues, but the level of dislike for BTC over there goes beyond normal. I am not making assumptions about you, as I have been in the same position of being anti-echo chamber.

@_date: 2017-01-25 21:10:59
ha ha ha ha haa OMG that shit was the bomb. Props
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:04:49
I for one can't buy stuff online of offline easily with BTC. It's one thing to be in an echo chamber of people who see the future, it's another thing to assume an average joe is gonna sell you his stuff for bitcoin (and spend time learning about it). OP has a good idea.
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:15:31
Already did, Kraken didn't respond =(

It's me, please send me all the Tree-Fiddy BTC. I'm nigeriam prince who will double my investment, this happened because the president king and sultan of my country stole my priceless BTC wallet for jealousy reasons.
Am i doing it rite. xD
(Not Srs)
@_date: 2017-01-21 23:31:23
Dope answer. Hit a bulls eye. Repped
@_date: 2017-01-24 23:43:05
Like i say, those who can't do ...hate. Props to you brother, that is a bomb use of free energy. I guess most people are bitter HODLers here, i say use Bitcoin to generate more wealth....It's what I do. BTC is like gold, you can hoard it like scrooge McDuck and die or keep it flowing back and forth and multiply. Hit me up if you ever need investment ideas. Always good to see people who DO shit instead of BITCH about it.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:04:04
Kraken has still not credited my wallet with the BCH they were supposed to. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 01:48:37
Man i feel like a robot, isn't there a sticky for this.
Localbitcoins is great, and I also bought from new marketplace called AllArk. Both cash deposit no hassle.
Good luck. (Every few days there is someone asking this so must be good for BTC adoption!)
@_date: 2017-01-21 17:43:22
That's a great way to think, right there.
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:33:21
Another hour gone by. Still nothing and Changelly has made. Grand total of $6 on this trade. Really Changelly...you're that broke. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:38:35

@_date: 2018-02-16 21:37:54
Sure a dude named glurp glurp knows more about it. I'm sure you'll be the first retard to hand over your routing number and account number to a guy promising you a BTC for 500. Hey bud I got a Bitcoin bridge in Brooklyn to sell ya derp ��
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:39:31
Coons gonna coon 
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:49:58
How much is coinbase paying you for damage control ��
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:36:42
I like that idea, everyone knows Nigerian Exchanges are the best. Let's both wait for that second BTC because the first one is going to a Casino in Vegas. 
I will send it to you Nigerian Prince. Pinky Swear.
@_date: 2019-05-08 22:06:48

Lol the first time I saw it I was like "what the heck��" but I'm sitting here with 2 pizzas so ��
I asked him how he is able to buy above market price he says and I quote "got money to spare and I'm bullish on BTC plus it's the only BTC thing that interested my nephews so why the hell not"

�� yeah I bought Pizza with BTC. I just went to "Sell" page and selected payment option "Pizza" ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2019-05-08 23:32:52
Costs me like $3 outta the ATM. I'm just happy to have some goddamn pizza for my BTC ��
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:16:14
In all seriousness i did pay the fee and it was nowhere near 20 mins. Just reporting whassup on ground and ruffling some feathers as mine were pretty ruffled when it took a couple hours to confirm 3;0
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:45:30
It IS kinda concerning when it takes this long, BTC is the OG but the wait is too long for my schlong
@_date: 2017-06-03 04:43:40
Bro...it is a well known fact that if you bought bitcoin in 2011 you have to send them to an expert to get them back.
I charge only $15 for the services. Just mail your laptop to me.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:04:33
You can thank all the Tether being dumped for this pump before Bitfinex exit scams. Are ya really this gullible that speculators dictate how you feel about BTC ��

^^ this guy xD I can do better. Keep the computer just send me the hard drive, i will even send a pre-paid premium expedited shipping envelope to you. And as soon as i get the hard drive i will let you know if there are any bitcoins in it....pinky swear 3;D
@_date: 2019-05-08 22:24:28
I don't think dude is sweating it on 10 bucks. IIRC it'd be like 0.000015 or 50 cents more than he'd pay if he bought it outright or something.
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:19:45
