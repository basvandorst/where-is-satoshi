Interesting article. And to be honest. I don’t need crypto to buy my lambo. I didn’t want to come across condescending I’m already very successful and could buy one if I wanted one (don’t) I just am new to this field.  And I think like many others. 90% of the verbiage in here like atomic swaps and lightning network etc. I have zero clue what all that means. I’m just a guy who believes in block Chain tech. Had some fun and was Pissed I got greedy and held so long. Maybe I’ll go to zero as well. I hope not. But if I do it won’t affect my life.  I feel bad for the people who got in over their heads.

I made money here so don’t get me wrong. I’ve been in It a while ups and downs. Just have friends on Wall Street loving it at our expense. To them It’s the 1990s all over again. I own 5 and will sit on them. My kids can have them when I’m dead. I was just venting today. I get the market I just hate the fact it’s so easily affected by a few big players. 
Seemed like we were out of that cycle. Guess not. 
I know by next week prob be at 7500 climbing up. 
I get it.

20% discount. And by the time you tipped price dropped another 10% so the restaurant should be out of business soon :)

That’s fatoshi.   It’s the fake satoshi. Poor guy got wrapped up in all this. Gotta love social media.

Not exactly. But the market if you notice goes up together and goes down together. I don’t just own bitcoin. I own about 5 others. After almost every big drop 5-12% a few days later you see a flash rebound. That is what I’ve been trying to hit. I don’t get it right all the time but law of averages have been working in my favor. It’s worked a lot better than sitting on my hands and praying. 
I’m not here to mock what any one else does was just giving my strategy that has worked for me. 
I was tired of sitting on the sidelines.

Im holding till john mcafee eats his dick. Then I’m out for good. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:57:22
Appreciate the honesty. And I hope your wrong 
I’m hoping to ride it out a few months more then see what happens in December. I do watch the news a lot as well and have friends on Wall Street. When I see a move toward major adoption then I may go back to holding. For now I’ll stick to what has Been working for me.

I bought just before the ath Had coins super cheap and watched them shoot to the moon.. 
Held past it out of greed thinking I was gonna make a million bucks with no end in sight. 
Only just see in January my portfolio shrink to next to nothing. I then held till about June / July and started trading putting aside buying selling putting aside etc.

Listen I love blockchain and the community. I just think the fat ass whales found a way to mess with the Pricing instead of letting things happen organically. And It pisses me off. I should not hAve said I give up. Because I really haven’t before and won’t now. Just annoys me when I see movement of Large wallets perfectly timed with announcements.  Not a big believer in coincidences. You can’t stop insider trading if it’s not regulated and we don’t want regulation so it’s like what’s the lesser of two evils. ??? Imagine if you had a friend at Apple who could tell you a few days in advance of their quarterly earnings ?? 
Now put that into crypto context. Maybe I’m just jealous who knows.  Let’s hope by January I can laugh it all off.

Wow coming from a dick is that a compliment ?

Sold at the ATH.  Guess we were just suckers. 
He can say all he wants about not being right to hold. I call bullshit.  Then he should have held and promised to donate the proceeds to charity. I stuck by him a while then moved all my ltc to btc and couldn’t be happier.

Your a super genius like the weatherman 
You only have to be right 50% of the time. 
How about we all just sit back invest in what we believe in and let it ride. The super genius idiots can post their fud all day long. When it’s up the geniuses said told ya so! When it’s down the geniuses said told ya so!  Kind of funny. How about your an a-hole 100% of the time.

JIM Cramer is an idiot.  He knows nothing.

That’s not why. It’s illegal for them to allow it. Just like you can’t buy stocks. It’s a federal law. 
It snuck through for a while till they caught up to It. They would love to let you buy It. They make a fortune of late fees.

He doesn’t get It. He’s pissed because had he mined It before anyone knew about It he probably would have made tens of millions. 
But all of a sudden he’s mr ethical?
Give me a break. He’s living in the 90’s
It’s like saying the internet is a fad. The whole point of crypto is even if you want to you can’t regulate It.  He’s being narrow minded it’s the money of the internet/future and it’s only in its infancy. 
It’s the worlds currency!

Never understood the logic. It’s my hard earned money. If I want to spend It on hookers cocaine or beanie babies that should be my choice.

Desperate times call for desperate measures. They couldn’t give a sh!t about any of these  coins until the market went south. They are yesterday’s news.  Their not so high and mighty now. I wouldn’t give them a $1
