@_date: 2018-01-24 15:52:01

edit:this is just the question. Chill guys with the downvotes

order book:
Red - some one wants to sell xxx ammount for yyy price
Green - bids to buy xxx ammount for yyy price
and than you have trade history:
Red - some one sold = buy order filled (from green order book) = price decreased
green- some one bought = sell order filled (from red order book)= price increased

What really is interesting is that 300+ BTC pay walls sometimes appearing and than few minutes later disappearing.
For example last week there were 3x 350BTC sell orders.

use service like changelly or shapeshift to exchange for monero and than back to btc
@_date: 2018-09-08 18:38:50
Thats the problem. No one is buying coins and is trading contracts.

I respect ppl who still hodl. I would not be able to ride it down to 6k 4th time in a year.

Its rather their posture. Bull has big front - uptrend chart. Bear has big bottom - downtrend shape.

you need to verify yourself and then via bank transfer.
Coinbase is more noob friendly but the fees are insane.
On Gdax you can buy with no fee (maker limit order), or just hit buy button with 0,25% fee
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:52:41
gdax.com its owned by coinbase. use same login and buy cheaper
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:56:52

@_date: 2018-02-05 17:36:00
Did the same, now its stress free watching it go down. Would definitely recommend.

This lines might be random. But every one draws them and looks at them.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:20:30
Or some one needs to restock bitcoins to dump later even further down

AMA request: someone who bought at 20k 
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:23:31
In order book:
green - buy bids
red - sell ask
Trade history:
Green - buy - price increases
Red - Sell - Price decreases
@_date: 2018-07-18 17:17:25
Kraken is like that when overloaded. You press buy and 5 sec later it gets executed. Also terrible liquidity resulting in slippage. Its probably the worst exchange right now. But the only option for USA to margin trade (legally, without VPNs). 
@_date: 2018-07-07 17:36:40
Yea i cant imagine holding from 20k to 6k than riding it to 9k and than again to 6k
