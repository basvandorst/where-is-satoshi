So, we need to wait a lot
@_date: 2019-08-28 12:58:02
So, how long do we have to wait to see the end of the story? I mean, when is the payment due? When will he go to jail?
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:48:37
So, where can I download this app?
@_date: 2019-05-22 08:20:36
I am riding this baby to 0 if I have to.
@_date: 2019-05-22 08:39:02
And yet btcsv and btch are still here. And bctsv got a huge pump. I wonder how long will it take for this bad coins to fall into the oblivion they deserve
@_date: 2019-05-19 09:18:39
Just.... Harsh?
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:13:09
Ledger nano x or ledger nano s
@_date: 2019-05-19 09:13:03
I like the ultra spike to 10M lol
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:02:56
I second this
@_date: 2019-05-24 05:29:38
Great job, great car
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:36:57
I don't know, surely will be more than 20k but more realistically it will be like 32 k and then back down to 10k
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:02:38
I feel like I have to tip you some Banano ahah u/banano_tipbot 10
@_date: 2019-05-21 05:31:09
It is fake though
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:52:06
I will buy all of your btc for 4000€ a piece
@_date: 2019-05-19 11:21:51
Question : does it work with local version of eBay and Amazon? Like. De. It. Es etc or only on .Com?
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:17:01
Maybe it is based on your search history
@_date: 2019-05-19 11:16:34
Oh boy, that sounds too much
@_date: 2019-05-19 11:23:05
Use a hardware wallet as soon as possible! I reccomend ledger nano
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:02:58
I can give you some Banano u/banano_tipbot 10
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:31:54
Just try to find a localbitocoin dude selling. If it is not near you, travel a bit. Bring soemone with you, never trade alone in person
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:55:54
7-8k for the next 2 Weekes
@_date: 2019-05-21 06:36:22
I really doubt that the average 50 years old American that saw that documentary started to read reddit to document itself on bitcoin. Still, good on you for trying to help out newcomers
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:05:43
Hummm... No coinmarketcap says the max was 8950
@_date: 2019-05-12 07:57:38
Seat belt ready!
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:44:25
Well it is just mY opinion but if I know bitcoin just a little, I think we will see 8000$ by the end of this week. After that there might come some weeks of linear trading
@_date: 2019-05-13 06:04:33
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:04:53
Omg it really happened????
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:53:20
The next step already taken
@_date: 2019-05-31 04:50:56
Perfection ��
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:21:00
This is a nice story. I really hope I will be still around to witness this
@_date: 2019-05-19 09:20:33
So, if this video is garbage.... What do you guys think an appropriate amount of btc would be, to be rich and without worries, after 2022?
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:17:23
A little bit of FOMO never hurts!
@_date: 2019-05-22 17:12:59
But did you pay with btc?
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:54:59
Looks good, but could you explain what this is? Lol
