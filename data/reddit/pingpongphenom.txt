Im not predicting itll hit zero, but its crazy to act like thats not in the realm of possibilities.  There are a number of ways it could happen, some very quick, some long and drawn out.
Scenario 1: someone finds a vulnerability they can exploit to get false transactions verified, or to derive the private key from a public key.  This would send bitcoin to zero overnight.
Scenario 2: lightning network doesnt solve our scaling problems and people migrate to another coin that can be used for point of sale use cases and other transactions where time and fees matter.
Scenario 3: crypto ends up being just a fad and everyone stops buying except the hodlers.

Duh? Thats why hes quitting.  Not everyone has the privilege of working jobs they love, most people dont.  I actually really like my job but if i had enough to never work again, i wouldnt.  I have plenty in life to do and be fulfilled without depending on my job for my identity and sense of worth.

Lol, no, worst case is it goes to zero, and it could do that absurdly fast.

Wut? The first time bitcoin hit $5 it was an 'all time high', now its &gt;1000x

not really any more mad than getting in at 7k.  either way you just have to accept you're playing the lottery, not investing.

i didnt say gold value is in flux, i said if fiat value is in flux. and yeah, if your country is experiencing hyperinflation you damn sure will be able to pay for shit with gold.
and sure, i was being flippant in calling pizza a store of value.  i just meant that like other goods and services, itll hold its value during a hyperinflation event.  if the USD becomes worth half as much tomorrow, then pizza will cost twice as much USD.

quite possible

"Why would I, (I being the consumer in this case) trade my gold coin (an example commodity) for a pizza, if i believe that gold coin could be worth double tomorrow."
if your gold coin is worth double tomorrow, we're in an extraneous situation.

so does this mean bitcoin will be fast enough to use for point-of-sale transactions once 'soon' arrives?

lots of people had the foresight about a great many things that never panned out.  if twenty people think twenty different things are the next big thing, and one of them turns out to be right, does that mean that guy was smarter than the others? maybe, or maybe it was just luck.

just ask the people who 'bought into the dip' for enron :D

It is, probably. However id rather invest and lose 1x now than not invest and miss another 10x or 100x growth.

but both gold and pizza are stores of value.  so even if gold ends up being worth twice as much fiat tomorrow, so will the pizza, so both of you are better off transacting gold for pizza if fiat is in flux.

No because capital gains counts as income, so most of his proceeds would be taxed above 0%

well, its either a single unit of internet money, or 100,000,000 units of internet money.  depends on your perspective.

Only if you just leave it sitting there as fiat, which would be utterly fucking stupid whether you earned it via bitcoin or salary.
But if you cash out of bitcoin and buy equities then youve just moved from a high risk asset to a lower risk asset, which makes a lot of sense if youve made enough off crypto to be financially independent.
