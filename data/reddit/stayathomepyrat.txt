I lost a bit on worldcom and wbvn. Honestly the voices sound the same for crypto as it did for .coms. People need to learn a lesson, this will be theirs. But for real, a least millenials can blame us for something now. Yeah, we fucked your shit up, oops. -signed GEN X

You must be an economic major. Only looking at the consumer side this thing, amiright? Can't escape inflation. Businesses will never accept anything that may be worthless in an hour. Keep hodling those losses. Remember, it's only a loss if you sell. So hodl till the end and you never lose a dime. Please. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:44:25
I hear what your are saying, and it's a good post. But, how do businesses account for potential losses by accepting crypro? That is still my main issue. I can sell a sandwich for $5 usd. I have to sell the same sandwich for $10 in bitcoin, cause it can be worth 50% less in 2 hours. But what buyer will pay that? They will say, it'll be worth more than that so I'm HODLing. It's catch 22. A business will say it's worth less, a costumer will say it's worth more. That's my issue, I ask the same question over and over. I never get an answer.

Exactly the reason noone will take cypto as a currency serious. Last week a friend told me he was going to start taking lite bit and eth at his sub shop. I asked how he would price his stuff vs. the dollar that everyone else is paying with. He said 1 to 1.  I told him he was sick in the head, why would I give 1 to 1 for a commodity has the potential to be worth 3 times what I give him today. I told him I would buy a sub for half the dollar cost in lite. He said no. I gave him $7 cash. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:06:42
Doesn't matter. They are still sold to fannie or Freddie on the back end, if the loan doesn't meet their guidelines, they don't buy it. Private lenders don't make money if they can't sell the loan. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:04:31
I get inflation. We also cannot make up billion dollar markets out of 1s and 0s. Which is essentially what is happening. Every new coin devalues another. Crypto is starting to eat itself alive.

If all that fiat was invested into cyrpto, where does it go? It doest just disappear, right? I mean, if everyone is a buyer, and there are no sellers, what's happening to it? It seems impossible to move to a digital currency, if fiat is always the end all. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:57:15
Sorry man, I'm in healthcare, my suppliers don't take gift cards. As easy as people make it out to be, it's a convoluted mess actually using it in the real world. People keep saying crypto will be adopted, and more people will get on board. You cannot just speak something it existence. It has too many real world problems. Why does it take a week, sometimes two weeks, to get the funds from my sold coin to my bank account? If I sell stock from my vanguard acct, it's in my checking in like 20 minutes.

Isn't the point to sell for fiat? I can't buy groceries with crypto. At this rate, if I invested fiat towards crypto, my buying power is less. It makes little to no sense to accept crypto as business owner either, I would have to overcharge my customers that would buy with crypto, because I would need consider the potential lost value. Don't get at me with the low fees, and quick transaction times. Because they don't exist. AND, none of my providers accept crypto, so I'm stuck with a shit "currency" that I can't do anything with.

 Nope, bought different stock. Savings is with everbank @ 1.4. But savings is savings, it's just there, and it grows. It's not retirement, it's not our stock port, it not out kids college savings, it's just there in case. Gotta have a nice liquid account for those moments.

@_date: 2018-01-31 19:04:04
Anything to make it sound different than it really is. Amiright?
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:21:51
Wrong. The money needs to be in the account as USD for 60 days. The fannie and Freddie guidelines are set up for all lenders. Private lenders as well. Now if you have a broker that's willing to sit on your loan, not sell it on the back end to fannie or Freddie (they are purchasers of mortgages, not lenders), then maybe they look the other way on the funds. But you will pay out the ass on your rate. They have to make money somehow, and if they cannot sell your loan (because you have documentation outside fannie and Freddie guidelines) then they will make their money on the increased rate. Don't bother responding. I processed, underwrote and closed these for 10 years. My wife bundled and sold them. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:00:30
Damn bro, the bitcoin echo.... I know what it is, and how it works. I made my $$$ and jumped out right before xmas. Your point isn't even valid, from a consumer standpoint. I can spend and invest with my american dollars, so why do I care to change that, I'm not worried anonymity, and my vanguard account has fixed fees that are much lower than any crypto. As a business, why would they accept it? I'm not accepting it at my business. I don't know one business owner that is. Don't give me something today that may be worthless tomorrow. It's just bad business. And don't start with the dollar collapse and fiat money, that just sounds like gold and silver blow hards of the last 20 years. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:17:20
This is exactly what my mom told me 20 years ago when my wife and i started making $$ on stocks. She said, "take your initial investment, plus 10%, leave the rest".  Glad to see not much has changed. Always feels good to cash out and have leftovers!!!

correct. and the new queen has to be assimilated into the hive, or the workers will just kill her. it's a cool process though, when you buy a new queen it comes in a little candy cage that gives the new queen protection while the old hive gets acclimated to her new scent, then the workers slowly eat the door to cage and she comes out. from our exerience, it only works about 60% of the time. but if you get a good laying queen, it's worth it.

30 year fixed rate. been paying on it for 20 years. you really have no idea how this works, do you? this is great. 
you don't need to say a few sats, it's implied based on math. basic math tells me there are a lot more than 21million homes around the world. if btc was only used for homes purchased, you wouldn't have enough to go around. you would be breaking down the btc, and using what? sats.

@_date: 2018-09-03 05:05:16
there is a finite cost associated with a home. land cost, building materials, permits, insurances...
 should I go on? you cannot simply reduce that cost because, "muh savings account".  If the number of people capable of purchasing a home is reduced that's a great opportunity to be a landlord and own rentals. sounds like a money maker to me. I'll jack the prices up to the point where you will never be able to save and buy. you will rent from me and pay my bills forever.
@_date: 2018-09-06 18:46:46
well that was a little DCA joke. look at the stock price history. then look at btc.
@_date: 2018-09-07 18:07:51

@_date: 2018-09-05 23:51:59
it's not a conspiracy. it's a fact. they can see what's going to move, before it happens. why wouldn't someone take advantage of that if there are no repercussions? I would do it if I had the money and contacts to open an exchange. it's unregulated, and easy money. you wonder why Satoshi is anonymous? if you knew who they wer, you would hate them for doing this. also the reason. you will never get an ETF.
@_date: 2018-09-05 15:55:23

yiu should buy gopro or fitbit stock.
@_date: 2018-09-07 16:15:32
a link to a product. why did you even bother? send a screen shot of the transaction.
@_date: 2018-09-01 13:50:11
this was debunked earlier this week. it's not even close to paypal, in reality
@_date: 2018-09-01 17:29:52
looking for a reason to buy back in. still have yet to see one. and I sold ltc
@_date: 2018-08-30 00:51:02
I'll let you connect the dots... ....he wants you to pay him fees.
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:31:17
so like, exactly what you could do with it 8 years. wow, such advancements. lol.
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:45:36
so then, you meant $6.5k CDN?
@_date: 2018-09-06 05:11:22
yeah? oops?
@_date: 2018-08-30 13:35:17
hey, I get it. you guys gotta start somewhere. good luck!!!
@_date: 2018-09-01 19:46:27
no, someone else paid a little more for information. you think those all that equipment was moved? nope, someone else just took over
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:08:45
no, it's because we are beach front.
@_date: 2018-08-30 03:35:04
I'm gutting the economy on investments that are 5-10-15 years old. get bent.
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:52:19
wow, that's real profound. it locks in your amount. no fucking shit. getting them to get that amount to you, that's another story.
@_date: 2018-08-24 10:19:01
no, it's just the way people are. some people call it, reality.
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:15:02
no, I mean like having to buy giftcards that have 10%+ mark up, because no one accepts crypto directly.
@_date: 2018-09-06 15:11:34
totally!!! etsy is another stock that's gotten me paid!!!! woop woop!!!! HODL!!!!
@_date: 2018-09-01 00:35:26
great, instead of just taking the gold, they can take you too, since the key only in your head. get over it, you don't have anything they want. there is no issue, no problem solved.
@_date: 2018-08-30 00:54:59
buybacks are getting me paid! someone invested in crypto instead of real companies, and lost a ton. oops. too late to be salty now.
@_date: 2018-08-30 00:42:35

you honestly believe you've left behind drug dealers and illegal stuff? that's a laugh.

no... ffs, it's a margarine alternative, and it's in the dairy isle.
@_date: 2018-08-25 15:06:00
you underestimate greed and capitolism. it will be run into the ground, until there is no money left.
@_date: 2018-08-23 19:38:05
when you blame whales for manipulation, they should be easy to tag. I never hear "damn whales sunk the gold price".
@_date: 2018-08-28 03:36:15
so you will stop buying at $16k?
@_date: 2018-08-30 11:29:23
TYL, only half the facts.
@_date: 2018-08-30 19:29:38
to the moon!
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:41:41
so wait, you want to get rich quickly? lol. that's not good for btc
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:03:10
then start a local bitcoin club in your mom's basement. as long as you are on a world wide site, you have to listen to other side. or as we like to think, the voice of reason.
@_date: 2018-08-30 00:50:04
so, thanks china?
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:02:06
the language you used says otherwise.
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:04:45
get on the site. dont look at what I typed. question it, go to the source. it's right there under.... ....fees
@_date: 2018-09-02 01:56:35
that's not how it works. I don't see the value at any price. P2P at Publix, or I have no reason to use it.
@_date: 2018-08-29 19:02:09
so you are saying people should support btc, just because? that's some sound investing advice.
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:08:14
lemme drop this on you....
@_date: 2018-08-23 23:00:41
I know that you know what BTC was supposed to be. get these newcoiners inline please.
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:05:35
well, people could always go to the site and see for themselves. but you know, moon and lambos get in the way.
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:14:26
hunh? no, I don't. I don't have a cent invested near anything related to Goldman.
@_date: 2018-08-30 00:45:30
as opposed to an outdated primary layer. at least they are trying.
@_date: 2018-08-09 20:25:27
soon as saw icojournal, I bought 0.94731 btc.
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:02:47

@_date: 2018-08-28 14:58:45
oh boy. every time someone says that, BRD's show up. ease off the gas buddy.
@_date: 2018-08-30 23:35:26
just copying your statement.
@_date: 2018-08-06 16:33:03
so you won't buy in the future after moon stage? that's a great currency you have there.
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:28:14
btc solves problems, that have already been solved. ok, got it! to the moon!
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:41:37
not anymore. regulation is good for btc now. the narrative has changed.
@_date: 2018-08-23 23:43:06
didn't bother to read that. so we can try again. how about 20 words or less to make your point. if you can't do that, you have no point to make.
@_date: 2018-08-30 13:40:31
wait a minute, so you guys plan on giving your own coin based on how much money is held on the exchange? using volitility for stable profits? hope this isn't a liberty reserve situation.
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:30:23
you called me a name. awwww.  I'm a product of the system... well yeah, med school. 
and I'm happy about it? well yeah, I'm making really good money, have a career, a lovely family, and a plan for retirement.  you have a better plan? bc clearly complaining is working out great for you.
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:49:31
OK do it. go out, get btc without fiat, and prove it right here. I'll be waiting.
@_date: 2018-08-11 22:28:10
OK do it. add something to the network.
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:25:04
a lot richer. lol. unless you cashed it out into fiat, it's just theoretical numbers. just like home equity,  theoretical value unless you sell your home and cash it out. talk to me when the money is in USD, not btc.
@_date: 2018-08-31 01:37:11
it's reddit man, anything goes
@_date: 2018-08-11 15:56:55
exchanges don't take cars for btc.
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:20:52
less than 10%

nooe, most of is aren't 90.
@_date: 2018-08-30 00:52:03
it supports P2P via 3rd party.  bwaaaaahahahahahaha
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:59:09
wtf are you trying to say? that looks like keyboard seizure. make some f'in sense and get back at me.
@_date: 2018-08-29 11:18:37
student loan debt, reread my comment.
@_date: 2018-08-28 14:59:49
no, it was dog that said it. didnt you see that comment above?
@_date: 2018-08-15 10:30:06
hunh? learn the lesson and keep losing money? fuck that, learn when to bail out. that's character building. not being a stubborn fool who keeps thinking he's going to moon when he starts his lambo. this dude must be a paid shill
@_date: 2018-08-31 17:26:43
FATCA laws don't prevent anyone from opening a bank account.  A simple Google search will explain them to you if you don't understand them. Don't be afraid, the IRS is not coming to get you.
@_date: 2018-08-29 19:03:28
paid shills? lol. where do I sign up? look up shill jobs on indeed? it's called how it is seen. you need to get over that.
@_date: 2018-08-28 18:44:41
that's a laugh.
@_date: 2018-08-20 13:06:51
tge difference is that a drive has an actual distance, and you drive an actual mph. btc is speculation and hope, neither are calcuable. apples to oranges.
@_date: 2018-08-21 22:45:23
two bcash is bad for btc
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:38:36
let's hear the gloat.

so why are you so upset? if you aren't even trying to make a point.
@_date: 2018-08-25 13:55:30
bwwwaahahahahaha...... I've heard some good ones, this is right up there. holy crap, take the tinfoil hat off, there are no neutrinos coming for us
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:31:20
I'll leave the opportunity for you. never I didn't give you anything.
@_date: 2018-08-30 13:19:13
nope, it's decentralized.... there's no way these exchanges would look at what people are buying (before they complete the transactions) and makes moves with that info. no way, why would they do that? everything is on the up and up. all good, nothing to see here.
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:11:04
it's on their page. $500 fiat, per month limit.
@_date: 2018-08-24 11:14:11
so, you amuse yourself trying to insult people you feel are less literate than yourself? your parents owe society an apology.
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:32:51
oops. too soon
@_date: 2018-08-26 03:51:31
in btc, not fiat. you get btc for btc, fiat for fiat. you aren't getting the fiat value of your btc.
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:32:16
apples to apples? not in this sub.
@_date: 2018-08-30 00:49:10
too bad it's just a shitty dub. tray parker and Matt stone dont give a shit about btc.
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:10:16
no cash app. the part of square he's touting in the article. did you read it?
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:08:34
you think that's bad? localbtc is even worse.
@_date: 2018-08-28 11:36:06
you mean July 2016? look at your chart again, nothing happened.
@_date: 2018-08-18 20:23:12
Anything besides moon and lambo is FUD is these parts.
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:01:25
did I ever say how the banks make money? nope. I originated and underwrote mortgages for over a decade. please, spare me your insight.
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:36:11
no, we are still having a conversation. I just have no filter once I'm off the clock. i have too many patients that I have to be nice to and coddle. reddit is a non coddle site IMO.  so, suck it up, buttercup. we can continue, but I did just slam 4 lagunitas 5th of nevers.
@_date: 2018-08-06 15:04:43
so just giving the exchanges a little extra $$ for fees then? why not just use fiat? seems, I dunno, easier.
@_date: 2018-08-22 23:17:18
God dammit, i know that. I was being sarcastic. fuck
@_date: 2018-08-29 19:04:43
and I want to succeed!!!! that's the best part. I hope it works. but I'm not willing to bet a cent that it does or does not. and right now, buying btc is basically just a bet.

the sooner the wolves move in, the sooner the sheep move out. that's about the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
@_date: 2018-08-30 20:12:16
I have. I'm not willing to pay a 15% premium on those. and the sellers aren't willing to sell for less. see, even when you act as your own bank, you have to make money. even at the ground level, people are still trying get well over spot pricing. I have yet to find a soul that would give me close to exchange prices. go ahead, check your zip code.
@_date: 2018-08-20 15:05:42
positive in the btc reddit sub. which is a world wide sub. which makes the world outlook on btc positive.
@_date: 2018-08-28 03:23:54
exactly. the halving has a date. it's already priced in. it is what it is.
@_date: 2018-08-24 12:14:27
who's denying anything? I never said it wasn't happening. it's clear things are happening, but all the things are, are 3rd parties taking their piece of your pie. why is cash app huge? because it's piggy backed off square. why does Joe Rogan push it? because he's paid to. come on man, I know you are smarter then this.
@_date: 2018-08-31 13:21:52
the article you linked is about the IRS giving people money back....  did you read it?
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:48:44
didn't you say 10.2 by end of week? pretty sure ur that guy. Make enough predictions, you'll get some right.
@_date: 2018-05-16 15:10:49
some else's bags by the sound of it
@_date: 2018-08-20 18:15:19
I'm not even sure what you are trying to say. other than, yeah pyrat, you're right.
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:37:56
cheese! this pasta needs some cheese!
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:36:22
spot on. I said it earlier, I'm not buying until 25k and the ability to pay Publix with my btc directly. down with the exchanges. down with robinhood. down with cashapp. down with the ATMs. fuck all these hands out. they all just want a cut.
@_date: 2018-08-22 20:17:52
it's had a decade. the world has passed it by. but it's coming, right?
@_date: 2018-08-15 14:08:01
really? I get rental payments all the time view bank wires. it's always free, and never an issue. get a new bank, there is more than one of them. try a credit union. I haven't paid a fee to a bank in over 20 years.
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:38:52
who are the entities? thanos? the watcher? get real. just like the paid fudsters claim. f'in lol.
@_date: 2018-05-09 18:47:11
what about the day before that? day traders trade everyday, so it shouldn't make a difference. if it's day traders fault, there is no hope, since it will always be day traded.
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:10:58
why? it's as useless now, as it was last nov-dec.
@_date: 2018-08-29 19:01:12
kinda like the post you just made? you must feel threatened.
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:30:59
and GD did I make a lot of money originating those loans.
@_date: 2018-08-30 00:32:54
ETF is already shot down. get over that.
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:54:21
right, cause an app is sooooo not mainstream. it's sooooo hard to click "download". coin base only has what 8 downloads? lol. come on.
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:48:15
it's not an ascending bart, it's a reverse marge. turn your monitor sideways, you're looking at it wrong.
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:20:38
how will you buy btc with no fiat?
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:40:46
so much for those pesky 3rd parties. you are all cool with rando's taking your money. But banks, no way, they are the bad guy. f'in lol. crypto looks more like medbox everyday.
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:40:40
could be smelling a lower top. time will tell.
@_date: 2018-08-23 14:40:14
dude, you post here all the time. unless you are lying through you posts, I have a pretty good idea.
@_date: 2018-08-20 11:10:28
could be over a kabillion too.
@_date: 2018-08-29 11:51:00
I'll add to that. most buyers look this stuff up before they contact a lender. a quick search on one of the government's (or whatever lenders) website, would have saved you trouble. if you were prepared, the money would have been seasoned and you could be buying this imaginary house your talking about. but no, just jump in head first and complain when it doesn't work out. you are the buyer that people don't want to lend to, you will be the first to default, because you are not financially responsible.
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:29:13
as a friend, I would tell you not to buy btc right now.
@_date: 2018-08-30 11:31:13
I'm a guy, so it's Mr.
@_date: 2018-08-14 12:11:20
no other use fr crypto. block chain is cool, but coins are not.
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:33:47
they aren't at all comparable. but that doesn't stop people from acting like they are. it was joke. sorry crypto has broken your sense of humor.
@_date: 2018-08-19 11:39:51
not even close. it's a one time deal to keep the guy from bailing out. making a mountain out of a mole hill, wtf.
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:07:33
which you should probably sell.
@_date: 2018-08-19 11:34:21
who the f takes checks these days?
@_date: 2018-08-30 13:14:17
circle logic to the fullest. we hate the banks for the same reason we love exchanges. lol
@_date: 2018-08-30 15:32:36
that's a laugh.
@_date: 2018-08-13 22:26:00
your user name gives btc a bad reputation.
@_date: 2018-08-14 11:44:25
thanks simple jack
@_date: 2018-08-25 14:17:35
ummmm..... money from suckers? you can get a coin going for almost nothing, and people will throw money at you for literally, nothing. As someone that likes money, I definitely see a need for that.
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:40:07
so world taxes too? no thanks. I subsidize enough already.
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:51:45
sells out? is it 1990 again, I feel like I'm talking to 16 year old me. you'll figure it out one day. maybe you won't. either way, good luck out there.
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:07:44
local btc..... but prepare to pay 10-15% over exchange price. it's a joke. everyone wants a cuts. that's all I see. hands out. look at this cool new app, look at this sweet crypto accepting site. everything is marked, as you guys pile up losses. it's a joke that you guys are the butt of.
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:48:53
the only thing Goldman wants to save you from, is your money. the less you have and the more they, the safer you are.
@_date: 2018-08-22 20:15:23
5%??? more like 0.005%
@_date: 2018-08-30 00:43:31
cough cough.... got me paid last year.
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:59:26
so then why look at December, if there will be a correction like you said?
@_date: 2018-08-24 01:21:39
try again. I didn't even need to count. i can tell its more than 20. it's cool, I get it, you don't know how to express yourself. you have run out of chances.
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:12:40
and if you add a little to the meatballs, you almost have a meal!
@_date: 2018-08-30 15:11:02
ok, so it's just moon for you. I get it. nothing else matters. specifically, the fucking reason btc was created. financial freedom. wait until these larger exchanges start buying each other up and really start to pound your wallet in the ass. you guys can't get coins into your wallet without them. I'll pay the miners, no problemo. P2P, or STFU.
@_date: 2018-08-28 13:05:45
good lord. there's some quality BS in that sub this AM.
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:51:37
a con man, that many people believed. I hope that Satoshi didn't have the same plan.
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:39:13
it doesn't matter what you say, these cats will just twist your words to fit whatever narrative they feel. true, false, it's really just about having the last word around here.
@_date: 2018-08-28 11:36:44
so then why are you complaining about the people that bought higher?
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:37:55
I really doubt that any comments on this sub affect btc. If the reddit comments actually affect prices, bail the fuck out.
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:03:49
make enough money, and you don't sweat taxes
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:49:04
exactly, get to the top of a bracket, you pay the same as the guy on the bottom. then start your legal write downs. it's the American way, every family is a company, or at least should be on paper.
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:01:59
sweet, which big bank?
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:28:53
he hasn't said anything I haven't heard 1000 times. and yes my mind is made up, if an opportunity presents itself I'll jump on it. currently, crypto is not that opportunity for me. maybe it is one day, maybe it isn't.
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:02:39
considered? I'm signing paperwork right now. watch out for that 60 coin buy wall. that's me!
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:18:29
does it matter?
@_date: 2018-08-28 21:53:09
The similarities between what he did and the crypto market are there. He talked a lot of people out of a lot of money with..... DCA. I read a lot of people on this sub that promoting that strategy. He isn't wrong, but it's definitely not what holders want to hear. I can't say I blame you for not wanting him to get any face time.
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:02:38
every coin that is mined is centralized, by the miners them selves. no miners, no coins. pretty straight forward.
@_date: 2018-08-16 04:06:55
um, that's not how that works. you can't take a mortgage out on more than 100% of the value of your house. if it's a second for the full amount, then what's the firsts mortgage amount? really?

nope. I went in on ltc and made a little cash last year. it was only to open up a line of dialogue with a physician I work with. he spent 50k, got 3.5 btc. and is now down about 30k. i told him to sell, he didn't listen. we joke about it now, and I get lots of referrals.
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:32:40
why would I need to jump through hoops to use money I can already use without jumping through hoops. and pay fees on top of that? no way. i haven't paid a bank any fees in over a decade, don't plan on doing it now.

you must have forgotten what Goldman did to many of its investors, the fraud cases, and their bailout. I wouldn't give them $10 of your dollars. and what ever they advise, I would disregard and run the other direction. these guys are in it for your dollars only.

bwaaaaaaahahahhahah.... lolololololol....  wtf? for real? this is part of your stand up routine, right?
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:33:39
except that you have to deal with a bank to handle your fiat to buy your btc. and then pay exchanges fees and transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:37:47
there isn't one. and won't be one. just some random posting a flame of what did happen last November.

there are no guarantees. you can go buy movie pass stock too. it's currently trading at $0.05.... down from an ATH of $132. looks like a great dip. hope people dca'd that one. lol. adding to a position, or investing in a losing asset. it can be seen both ways.
@_date: 2018-08-30 11:58:44
you guys give out free sats with every transaction. other then that, you're not wrong.
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:13:06
why do people keep saying that. we don't go anywhere, you guys just get all excited and out comment us.
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:13:00
well, not really. I was using TSN in 1990 online and hitting the old Boards for pics and Sierra games. it was so much fun.
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:05:51
it's crypto man. you gotta love the logic sometimes.
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:16:37
right, keep telling yourself that. buying the dip isn't dca either, that's random purchasing. I've never needed to chase investments and tell myself I'm doing the right thing buy using DCA. I see an opportunity, and load up one time. that's it. hold and sell. my life is good bro, don't worry about me. unless you need scripts or woundcare, in which case, holla, I'm happy to let you pay my bills.
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:15:34

it's every cliche I've seen, in one post.

tech stocks also lost a lot of money, and was a bubble. you are stating this like every tech stock was a winner, when that is far from the truth.

@_date: 2018-05-30 14:15:26
but we don't have the problems today that caused the crash. banks aren't failing, there's no subprime mess, and we aren't rejecting bailouts. why do think we are due? what can you point your finger at, and say "that's the problem that will cause the crash?". we all saw the subprime mess coming (i was @ 10 years in mortgages at the time, and got paid at lot to make these sh!t loans), everyone processing, originating, and closing these loans knew that they couldn't get repaid.

@_date: 2018-08-30 14:17:03
there is crypto-news.net article about you guys that states something else. you may want to reach out to them and sort that out.

trying to insult a person is a far cry from making a point. lol. move along.
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:16:58
yeah ok. let's go icos!!!!! actually, I believe there is a limit to how much fiat can be printed and it has a great store of value, as tress are a finite commodity, and the power harnessed by the printers cost money to run (and the govt won't release fiat for less than it cost to mine, I mean print) so there is value and limit in fiat. btc has no reason to be a standard, whatsoever.
@_date: 2018-05-05 18:26:10
but Kanye loves bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-22 20:09:28
I didn't downvote, I don't care enough about the comment. however, it's actually the coiners who are doom and gloom. they are counting on the collapse of fiat to turn crypto loose. how much more doom and gloom can you be? I'm saying all is well in the world, nothing to sweat out here.

the sec meeting?!?!? lol
@_date: 2018-08-18 21:10:03
I think you allowed to be bearish if you are looking at the 5 minute chart and spot a coffee cup triangle wedge. it's technically not bearish, it's actually a double bull reversal, which is like multiplying two negatives. it really means btc is about go exponential, which is bullish. see how that works?
@_date: 2018-08-31 23:51:18
it won't. people act as their own bank, they need to charge like a bank. local btc is still sitting around 7500-7800 in my area. who is going to pay that? the exchanges gives me a better price, but then I'm basically using a bank. P2P at a fair price or I'm not getting involved.
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:44:34

.... good luck out there.
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:51:38
yes, and get points year around, then use those to take free vacations. bitcoin doing that? and yes I understand that fees are built in. you think they will lower costs just for crypto? no, they will just make more money off you. they may even charge you more, because of volitility. keep thinking that all sellers are looking out for your bottom line, they aren't. adjust downwards accordingly, that's a pipe dream.
@_date: 2018-08-25 14:09:52
no they won't be millionaires over night. same way a loss isn't a loss unless you sell, a gain isn't a gain unless you sell. if these guys sell off overnight, you are looking at a major crash.
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:55:19
if no one sells and no one buys, price plummets, not rises. btc not being available means there is no reason for anyone to accept them (buh bye adoption), adding to an additional loss in value. lol. none of this is good for btc.
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:06:03
I haven't had any problems with them either. I only have a CC with them though. pretty good rewards.

trading bitcoin does nothing for me. I have no need/desire to chase and chart. I only got in to keep a line of dialogue open with a physician I work with. figured we could bond over it. sounds stupid, but that's how it works sometimes. it was a "spend money to make money moment". I figured even if I lose it all, a couple referals would more than make that money back, so who cares. he lost a about 30k, I made about 1k.  we joke about it now, and I still get referals. so now I actually need to see some tech before I make a move.
@_date: 2018-05-09 21:05:57
but the tech? I thought it wasn't about profits. I thought it was to be hodl and spent at the same time?

I would think advancements in solar power and other renewables could mitigate the power issue. and really that's the only thing that connects crypto to any sort of a real world valuation. you can always say that it cost X to mine a certain coin.

not at all... btc is far from = fiat.
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:53:33

well, you can go buy a new car for $20k, get into a car accident driving off the lot, and still have a new car. but you can't sell it for 20k. but 1 new car is still 1 new car. the whole 1btc = 1 btc is about the worst argument I hear about the value of btc.
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:50:00
people actually don't care about crypto, except those looking for quick money, and those looking to take that money from them. pretty simple if you ask me

price is actually controlled by the market? then why are there different prices on every exchange? and with volume as low as it is, please explain the weekend jump. it looks more manipulated by the day.

@_date: 2018-08-29 11:45:13
you are so far off base here its not even funny. you probably shouldn't buy a home. and no,  you can't use btc for a down payment and get a mortgage. money must be seasoned in a bank for period of time (90 days, oh wow, the hardship) it shows a level of finincial responsibility, and means the money is most likely yours. you can buy a house in a straight cash and with straight btc. if you get a mortgage, your money must be seasoned.
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:13:15
lol. not even close. what a reach.
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:00:25
alts are trash for trading and getting more btc if you are lucky enough to not loose your ass.
@_date: 2018-05-11 18:00:56
who is profiting? my bank has never charged me to issue a certified check, and I have the same one printed and sent every month. you must really hate mortgage and title companies, they make thousands in closing fees.

honestly. lol.
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:18:46
well, as soon as I see a fact, I'll react. everything you stated is an opinion.
@_date: 2018-08-22 21:04:20
stop with no middle man and decentralized talk. btc and crypto are neither of those things at this point. fixed supply, yes. accounted for by math, yes.
@_date: 2018-05-11 15:12:06
what's all bulshit? a certified check? cash isn't illegal. just in purchases over $7500. I don't see a problem with that. if you have the funds in your bank account, they will issue a certified check, done deal. it protects both parties. why risk carrying that much cash to begin with? unless it was for purposes that you would rather not report to the gov't.
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:09:36
Nothing tied to goldman is good news. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 14:37:21
that's a solid arguement for dca! good luck out there
@_date: 2018-05-29 13:52:28
if it's simply held, it has no value. you are literally hording nothing. if it's not spent, it's not useful. to increase value it needs really world use cases, not just hold. scarcity does not equate value. that has been proven many times over.
@_date: 2018-05-19 14:46:14
you have 10 million laying around? wow. must be nice.

@_date: 2018-05-11 13:29:33
I do. it's original intent was to give buyers the confidence to keep buying a falling stock. it's the original trader scam.
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:36:13
I don't disagree with anything you said. the crypto resources are a safe place to put money right now, though. Nvidia and Intel stock has performed well very over the last couple years. less risky than the crypto itself, and still great returns.
@_date: 2018-05-07 23:43:27
there was just a whole article, right here on reddit, about the nightmare experience buying on Newegg and overstock with crypto. are you guys that forgetful?

eficient escrow for tranactions? and it is better than what current method of escrow for transactions? basically, I'm asking what it would currently replace. the only transactions I ever use escrow accounts for are mortgage transactions. and the volitility of bits value would make me hesitant to put it into escrow, since the valuation of said amount could change the second it's put into escrow. rendering the amount in escrow worthless or worth way too much, affect buyers and sellers on both sides. ecrowing crypto is a horrible idea the more I think about it

A. if I don't benefit, then that hurts you as a holder, not me. if BTC is a "currency" then there is no benefit, it's just means of transaction. unless you are simply referring to making money, which again, I'm not missing anything if I'm risk adverse, which I now am. I'm happy with 7-11% annual growth. B. I've said over and over, I'm am very interested, I ask questions and state the obvious based on what I've seen over my 20 years of managing my own port.  some consider that FUD, I don't care. I never get a question answered in anything other than cliches, and the FUD statement

holy fuck. stop being naive. have you looked at local btc? I don't know why anyone in their right mind would use it. if I'm just trading back to fiat at a loss, there is no reason at all to buy, hold, and use btc. I'm am literally giving away money.

so again, they still don't accept bitcoin in house, call them up and ask for yourself. but they will take sellers that want crypto as payment. they still don't have a way to close though, and you will need to purchase the property in full coin without a mortgage, so that's an issue.  it's great cheap marketing, tbh.
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:03:12
Well when you put it like that, it's good news. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:29:40

You won't. So stop worrying about it. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 13:20:10
and someone else wants fees.
@_date: 2018-08-06 15:51:13
I don't see the fees being reduced, they are just being shifted onto the consumer directly. leaving the customer paying fees to get btc, then paying additional fees to use it. I agree though, retailers will need to discount goods and services to spur activity. seems like the only logical move.

the fact that you are guaranteeing wealth in your post makes it untrue. you can't promise that, that's insane. my opinion shouldn't affect bitcoin, so that's good it, way to point that out. so you are waiting a whole two years to get rich? wow, what conviction. what an investor. you are dellusional, at best. lol. people like you are the reason I read this sub, do you realize that????
@_date: 2018-08-30 03:32:47
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:49:11
cool, so then absolutely the reason crypto was invented, right? for all those 3rd parties you want to get rid of. for all those institutions that are making money off of your money! be your own bank! the double talk is loud in this room.

i know exactly what it is, it's lost and trying to find its way. I've read plenty about it, and I'm not blown away, so what? I'm not desperate and dreaming of getting rich off a $37 investement. I'm risk adverse and my retirement is already set up, I make plenty of money and have no reason to chase this thing. if becomes as widely accepted as people think it will, easy to use (which it currently is not), stable in price (you guys hate stable, only moon shots, amirite), then maybe I use it because it becomes the norm. right now, it's a speculative Charlie foxtrot. but if you would like to educate me, please do so professor btc.

Sure do. Don't engage in activity that looks like drug dealing or money laundering. Pretty easy for 99.999997% of the population in the US.  I feel bad for the 600 people it happened to. And according to your old article, uncle Sam is trying to fix it and make it right.

I'm not debating anything. I'm simply pointing out, that the Starbucks fiat-crypto-fiat thing is pointless and doesn't help anyone but a 3rd party. if Starbucks wants to accept crypto and make a difference, accept it, and partner with vendors that will accept it, instead of having to reconvert it. that would be a move worth noting. Starbucks accepts crypto currencies, and has partnered with a vendor that accepts said crypto for payment. that's hypeable. not this.

missing out on what? even people that are tech savvy have issues buying and selling crypto. jo mama on main street doesn't GAF about it. it's not FOMO if people don't care, it's artificial. it's the 12 year old that lies about everything he has, because he actually has nothing.

it's really that simple. I try to explain that to people, they just don't understand seasoned money. they can't wait 90 days on saved money in a checking account. it's like it's foreign to them to not spend every dime in your checking account, all the time. I hear "30 days is enough", "this is rediculous"..... over and over again.... well, talk to Fannie and Freddie.

I never said it was going anywhere. that's just you jumping the gun and assuming things. clearly it's not going anywhere, but the current bump is temporary IMO. that's it, nothing more, nothing less. you can assume all you want, you're just wasting energy and time.

anyone would say that. just look at the comments here and on r/bitcoinmarkets. no one is looking to hold at this bump, people are trying bailout and take small profits. what does that tell you? buy their coin, pay for their profits, and let it drop on your dime? then what? sell the loss? get real man.

It's not an investment. It's not mainstream. At the rate it's going, there are about to be a lot of angry broke bag holders in the comments of reddit. institutional money means nothing. Why? Because someone has to sell, in order for someone to buy. What happens when they sell? Price drop. Crypto is a convoluted circle jerk, and only 1 person is getting off. Guess who it isn't, bag HODLers.

I suppose that's one to look at it. You guys have a whole bunch 1's and 0's. He has a fuck ton of money. You are hoping for a moon shot, he's getting one. Have fun holding. I'm a holder too, just in things that are easy to liquidate, and pay me dividends. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:52:40
You didn't know the daily limit, and that's the banks fault? Do you blame the gas station when you run out of gas?
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:21:38
For real.  Keep just 3-6 month of expenses  liquid in case of emergency. Everything else needs to be getting some returns.

Not all what you said. You said waltoncoin was going to run a city based on block. It's not, they are supply chain RFID, that's it. Not running a city. Gifto is uplive's notification service.

No, you posted that after it popped, trying to be snarky. Come on man, that's so hollow. I don't know what it will do from here, and I don't care. What i like is watching people lose their mind over something they don't understand. The comments and general lack of awareness in the bitcoin community here is lol worthy at least half a dozen times a day.

If the block tech did something useful, it may make a btc pop again. But the usefulness of the block chain tech just isn't there for anything outside crypto right now. So why buy into a useless tech? Make some real world applications for us.

No, you posted that after it popped, trying to be snarky. Come on man, that's so hollow. I don't know what it will do from here, and I don't care. My guess, it moves a direction.

Is this good for botcoin? I mean, I'm tempted again. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:04:58
But that lowers the price. And all the HODLers say it's best to HODL not sell. But it's wise for an exchange to sell? The double speak is getting better by the day. Keep buying the dips! Dollar cost averaging! To the moon! I love it.

 Again, don't forget to take your meds. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:48:20
Exactly. If there is a finite number of bitcoin, and the exchanges takes a small piece off every transaction, then wouldn't the exchanges ultimately end up with all the coin?

@_date: 2018-02-03 15:36:11
I didn't say it was bad. But there are a lot of people on here saying +2,000,000 buyers coming online with robinhood at launch. That's just not reality. There may be +2,000,000 getting the notification for the app being ready to download. How many won't even download bc they are scared now? How many will download, get flustered and not do anything? My guess is between 10,000 -20,000 actual buyers/sellers at launch. That's still a decent number.

you label yourselves. I don't need to. your comment confirms my belief. thanks bud!

right, then you just have to pay a bunch in fees to use your money. if you are a merchant, you have to constantly change your pricing, based on "dildos". not everyone wants to be their own bank, especially if it's costing you money to do it.

it's a joke at this point. crypto heads are tearing each other part, it should be a unified front. considering how "important" the block chain technology is supposed to be, the vision should be clear, but it just gets more murky by the day.

because reality is painful to these people. they hate the truth. anything not Moon, lambo, fomo, and the charts, is FUD. I just come here for the lol's. reading the comments always reminds me that I'm doing the right thing not putting my money in this space again.
@_date: 2018-07-21 14:11:15
because they don't need to risk their money like this. you are trying to be them, they have no reason to try to be you. you are trying to turn $100 into 1,000,000.00. they already have millions and have no reason to risk turning it into hundreds.
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:26:13
blackrock is huge, yes. isn't that the antithesis of what you all want? what happened to decetralized, f the man? you guys are happy to have large banks and other institutions take over your space, and wipe their asses with your white paper. good god, coiners will believe, repeat, and double talk anything for a pump.

well, I was having a laugh. sorry you didn't.
@_date: 2018-07-12 14:16:17
no, they don't. when bitcoiners are putting their "investment" money on credit cards, you call that understanding debt? college student taking their student loan money to "invest" in crypto, that's understanding debt? lol. get real.
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:38:15
why? if it's a currency used for goods and services, there is no reason to buy, just use as you see fit, and buy when ever you need it. unless you are just trying to get a moon bound lambo. in which case, well, good luck with that.
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:55:08

All fud effects btc price. Btc has no real value other than what people are willing to pay for it. If people think it has problems, they don't buy, price drops. No buyers = no sellers = no market. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:54:27
but the picture is much larger. i would look into Blackrock a bit further before taking their word as gospel. they are exactly what btc is supposed to be freeing you from. people say this is the revolution against all the banks, but everyone screams with joy when (enter random) financial institution says something positive about crypto.  they are taking your $ and laughing behind your back. they will say anything to get a fee. good luck out there.

You don't have 10k to "invest" if you are using it for bills. And what you are describing "make money today, because bills are due today" is gambling, not investing. The first thing I do when I need to pay my mortgage is get on ditech online and click "pay now". No need to sell cypto, no need to sell stock, no need pull from my 401 or ira. You need a lesson in budgeting. If you cannot pay your bills with your salary, you should not be sinking it into a volitle speculative asset.

A quick search also shows me that China does allow it. They simply charge a fee per tx, and have daily and monthly caps. Now, again, if you are trying to skirt laws, that's on you, not China.

I'll add to that.... there is a serious shortage in nursing right now, and it's not getting better. Our population is aging, and we need good people healthcare. If you want a pretty good paying job, get an LPN license, it's cake work (pass meds, run to a random code), but the hours can be long. But you can make 60k per year easy. Want to make more? Get your RN. Work in a hospital, get specialized. Want even more? Get your BSN, work in a hospital, and manage nurses or get into teaching (with your MSN). Want to double that? Get your nurse practitioners licence. Then you can do simple surgeries, open a practice, get into family medicine, be a PCP. The sky is the limit with that bad boy.

Cause he's a bs shill and not good for bitcoin. This is why people will never take it seriosly. He's doing all this grand crypto stuff, but won't say how or where.... look at his comments, it's lunacy.

Seriously. PR is US. This whole post is bad for bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:20:02
Lol. Keep trying. Answering a question with a question, is not an answer. If I have to explain the history of USD (and it's "intrinsic value") to you, you should definitely stay far away from crypto.

He asked me to tell him how successful I am/was/is.... so I did. And I would agree that success is what you make it. I worked (and so did my wife) hard as hell to get where I/we are today. My mom didn't help me, I signed up for the military to pay for my schooling. I literally signed my life away for a chance to go to college that wouldn't financially cripple my mother. Any person over 18 (and under in some cases) can do exactly what I did. No luck, just hard work. Some people aren't willing to do that. That guy, is one of those people.

Just remember, when someone states that btc has no intrinsic value - they are right. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:09:18
This is not good for bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:38:12
If you hold, it's worthless. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:31:18
And? Wrong way
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:39:26
Holy crap. Take your meds. Comments like this are bad for bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:24:59
Cash works pretty good in a black market too.

Thats the Webster definition of arrogant. If you can't read a dictionary, I can't help you. You'll read it, though. Just like you'll read this. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 21:15:13
that's supposed to be satire, right? cause I'm not sure if I should lol, or cringe.
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:38:26
I'm white too! High five! 
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:00:15
That's a completely different scenario than the original one. You went from cash carry in the US to international ~ to ~ earning money legally in China and how to get it out of that country. Stay focused.

He lives in portland. And is wishful think posting.

From where? What do you see happening that will lead to a financial crisis that paves the way for bitcoin? Nothing. There is nothing. What, a mortgage lending issue? Nope. Inflation? Get real. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:24:20
Totally. Story of my life.

Most of these guys sweat looking at screens, a gym would kill them.

30 years for tech like this? Didn't take the iPhone 30 years. Didn't take netflix 30 years. Didn't take automobiles 30 years. It's almost a decade old now, and I still can't use it without hefty fees and lot of unnecessary transfers. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 02:12:15
An emergency small amount of cash, that you pay a huge fee for, that keeps happening? Sounds like you are a great financial planner.
