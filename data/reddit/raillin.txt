the IRS realizes that taxing bitcoin is like herding cats while looking through a kaleidoscope so they defer a lot of this doc to other similar things with no real guidance except that if you hide too much they will come after you and make it up as they go

but this takes gold mining and puts quite a few curve balls the deeper you look at what goes on..  from 100 yards back they look the same, but in practice it is much different.
never really heard of gold miners belonging to a mining pool and then some get rewarded for crap dirt they dug that never found anything.. etc..  and now shelved shares where you may get rewarded for past failed efforts so how does that work on mark to market?   and most in the pool never actually mine ANYTHING.. they are rewarded as a shared entity of effort and in lots of different calculations depending on the pool rules at the time
so to be clear, only the pool operator is mining bitcoins and everyone else is working for him and getting paid for effort in value paid in bitcoins

More details are coming out.  I hope it is a model that will spread.  We don't need 3 or 4 huge privately ran pools to pick from, we need to get the mentality out to have pools be more public sharing towards bitcoin initiatives

abuse is a sad thing... it is rampant in the mining side of crypto
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:42:03
they really sidestep explaining taxes on mining.. it is way deeper than they stated.  mining pools makes people mostly an employee of the pool and the pool is the one doing the mining and assigning work and that effort getting rewarded has many different flavors depending on how the pool works.. this is an issue on that whole mark to market part.. if you realize the value once you trade the bitcoin then mark to market at that point it would make more sense

There are countless questions on reporting mining. Perhaps examples of gold mining might be good to start with (deductions on gear, energy, labor) and how do gold miners mark their gold?  Everyday to market or when they sell?

Yes we need more pools to support this type of behavior - people can stay at their current pools, just get them to switch to supporting initiatives that support bitcoin or leave them to pools that are.

@_date: 2014-03-22 20:01:43
The message is that pools should start switching over to community driven model. It doesn't have to be one community pool for all... but getting miners to switch to any pool that is community driven. 
Mining companies are running very large pools now and they got there by pre-sales not by private funding.
Perhaps saying it prevents a 51% attack is over reaching, but if we could get most mining pools to to be community driven that would boost the ecosystem for all.

PPS can bankrupt a pool during bad luck.  It seems something went wrong with BTCGuild with either luck or something else since their share of the network doesn't add up to the luck they had the past month or so.. variance doesn't really explain it for me
@_date: 2014-03-25 01:01:40
completely agree..  I've been saying much the same for months as well...
we all know that the same amount of coins are mined roughly no matter the diff, but we are seeing more and more in less and less hands which means sharper sell offs..  
we can only stand back and let them eat themselves.. and pick up the pieces afterwards

were you born yesterday?  of course the tech and gaming scene is full of casual sexism and many of the chicks are ok with it..  in fact they like being the 1 in 1000 at the geek convention since they get all the attention
Are you going to overly condition every other human response we have as well?
Girls like what they like period.  Have you seen all the chicks into 3D printing since they want to make jewelry and shoes?
So they go into the space they like...
 I guess there is rampant sexism in wall street since only the money honeys on camera are involved and so many other women are mad and just dying to be brokers but can't because of those whores!!!

@_date: 2014-03-22 20:27:53
that's a good point... perhaps the voting system they create can have some type of signed submission from addresses if people choose to not register
this is early stages but I can see a new direction of mining pools if people embrace what the message is.
and I am not saying it all has to be one community pool.. just pools switch over to this type of model for the long haul of supporting what we are all trying to do here and not just mine, dump and turn off old hardware
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:47:08
They need to give a framework on mining..  lots of deductions on gear, electricity and administration.. yes, they don't just run by themselves just like buying gold mining gear takes labor to run them, you still do a lot of work with miners especially if you overclock ..  now do we go further and only charge the extra labor on the overclocked portion of gains since less labor is involved with running miners at normal??  I can go on and on and on with all the ways to slice and dice mining cost basis and mark to market assets, etc
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:10:07
which means it may be dumb to put any bitcoin action down until guidance since you may look like fraud even if you are just trying to do the right thing.
rather they put guidance and offer amnesty.. that is the only sane thing to do
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:07:15
open your eyes
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:01:43
the amnesty sounds legit...  basically keep a lot of records and wait..  miners may have a lot to claim as cost-basis with gear, power costs, labor/admin costs, etc plus all the weird ways to show gains either mark-to-market (pools give you little drips so do you mark each little drip to market? and then start the ticker for short or long term gains per drip?)
The more you dive into accounting for miners the more questions you end up with
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:43:35

If the IRS and Gov wants some money they have to WORK for it like everyone else..  they have to provide guidance and not just make it up as they feel like it years later and expect us to expose ourselves with best efforts that they will pick apart
reporting mining is extremely subjective and needs baselines

@_date: 2014-03-22 20:05:43
I think they should focus on the community driven side and not the preventing 51% attack.. Preventing 51% attack is more of a technical aspect since just saying other people will be more responsible is faith, not solution.
But, step back and think about pools being community driven and not just big private pools that made their mountain from pre-sales not private funding and you will start to realize that pools should be driven to bolster bitcoin projects
