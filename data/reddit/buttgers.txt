Move them to a different exchange that allows full trading in Canada.

The problem you're going to run into is the extra premium to pay if you find someone local on a local bitcoin exchange that allows it. Or, if you find someone willing to spot you this stuff they will suffer from tax liability (not sure how much, as this is new to me and the IRS too), which again increases the premium on top of the current price.
Maybe a Redditor nearby you can do a cash swap in person and transfer the coin(s) to you.  I wouldn't advise doing it blindly over the internet. I would no doubt help you out, but just the risk involved makes it a no-no sight unseen. In person with strangers only for something like this.

The volume is already trending towards sell, but you might be right in that the bulk of it won't happen until tomorrow morning Eastern Time.

My first takeaway from that article was that he justified the way that the current banking system operates. That's the biggest flag from that entire article. US currency is so great that we can manipulate its worth by fidgeting with the interest rate and take on massive debt from other countries to maintain its "perceived" value.

Google's IPO looked insane when it came out. Lots of people thought, "too expensive, too late." Look at how it blew up and split over the years.
$4000 is a lot of money, but it's still not too late. It wasn't popular or taken seriously under $1000. It was kind of looked with more scrutiny at $1000. Now, it's talked about by big investors all over.

Yeah looks like it's sitting around 4020 ish.  I noticed some ALTs picking up some buying volume though.
Edit: hah, jumped to 4050 as I posted this

Use GDAX in the browser. It's the exchange for Coinbase Lower fees, and you can use the limits for no fees

I used Mycelium on account of user recommendations. Saw the fees associated with using it and said fuck that.

All bitcoin transactions and transfers are on the blockchain. How much work the IRS wants to do to find evaders is up to them. Unless you tumble the bitcoin (costs money, is a huge loss risk, and not guaranteed) you're leaving a digital trail on the blockchain.

Eh, I just put in another buy.

This needs to be seen by all the crypto and tech subs.
I contacted my rep, so I'm hoping we can put a voice of reason into our government officials' heads.
