The biggest ripoff when wiring money internationally is not the fees but the bullshit exchange rate the banks give you. The difference amounts to about 7% (Bank of America). After lots of trial and error I finally found a a company that gives legit rates (usforex.com), but most people just go with their regular (big) bank and get royally fucked without even realizing it.

He gets MS notifications but does not have 2 factor authentication setup on Blockchain
@_date: 2014-08-16 12:22:02
Checkout BitPing.org - it has a bunch of options
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:12:00
Thanks for the help. He's so freaked out he has moved his stash to another address now and doesn't want to deal with Blockchain anymore. I guess the address changed because he did a restore.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:37:57
He is pretty good about using virus protection. Re 2 factor - please see above... I don't think he did.
EDIT: The reason I think it was a virus is because he says the transaction was initiated the moment he logged in.

The downside risk is limited and known. The upside is unlimited and arguably MASSIVE. Take the hit and do it!

Coinbase is great, but if you want something simple and quick you can use  which I developed so I could configure payment options into a URL. Thought it might be of interest...

Don't tell people what to think or say. If you have another opinion, by all means voice it, but keep your arrogant superiority to yourself please.

Yes but it would nice not to worry about ever losing the most critical data which is the record of financial transactions (typically sales).  You could lose everything and still know it's secure. Basically as long as you have the pass phrase you cannot lose the data that matters. 
Embedding customer and product information in the key/address adds zero extra load on the bitcoin system but gives you a permanent distributed record.
@_date: 2014-10-13 14:16:44
Haha... nice try all the same!

Ok that would make sense - if he doesn't have email notifications set then he wouldn't know until he logged in and his local wallet synced. I will get more detail and update later.
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:22:19
Panic over!  Somehow his address in Blockchain changed. I suspect we are just too unfamiliar how it works but when he logs in now he sees the new address with the correct balance.
Here is what he says happened:
"I logged in on my phone.
I immediately got a sms that a payment of .ooo1 BTC had been sent from my wallet.
I then requested a backup just in case. This was sent to my email:
Attached to this email is an AES encrypted wallet backup which contains everything you need to restore your bitcoin balance. You can use it to restore the wallet at anytime at My Wallet or using the 3rd party MultiBit Desktop client.
I went to my wallet just now and my bitcoins appear to be in there (see attached screen)
I got a text that my balance had been moved"
Thanks for the help and I apologize for the false alarm.

While there's a role for some small cryptos the only possible challenge to Bitcoin will be a crypto that has true anonymity built in from the get go. Bottom line... Bitcoin is going to play nice with the Feds, and that will leave the door open for something else. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 13:33:11
Not true. Google has always been the forerunner of the "get as many users as possible and the rewards will come later" philosophy - just look at Youtube, a hugely expensive operation. They make stuff free, or as close to free as possible, and then reap the rewards through harvesting user information coupled with advertising. Bottom line: It's a huge opportunity for them.
@_date: 2014-07-14 19:34:28
Of course it's complicated. People don't go along with getting shafted just because they are too lazy to figure out why. That's a lazy answer.
@_date: 2014-04-02 13:36:37
Furthermore, I'm willing to bet the fees they charge are designed to cover expenses, not make a profit. They undoubtedly pay lower CC %'s to the banks but they still cover all the hassles of fraud prevention, chargebacks, etc. Bitcoin would be (should be!) a no brainer for them.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:54:51
I'm not sure about the 2nd password either. I will update this as soon as he gets back to me.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:37:05
I know he was going to, but I don't think he did. I am waiting to hear back from him. However if it occurred as he logged in, I am assuming it is unlikely somebody had his login info.
@_date: 2014-08-29 15:56:15
God bless and safe travels Mr Finney. You are an inspiration to us all.
@_date: 2014-08-12 15:44:02
I did the same thing at  but it allows the payment request to be configured in any (commonly used) currency. It automatically generates the equivalent BTC payment request (when the link is clicked). So for example you can configure a link to pay $20 at the current BTC/US$ exchange rate. It also lets you save links in an address book.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:35:48
Correct. I initially put the wrong address in and then corrected immediately - sorry. I thought I did it quick enough.
@_date: 2013-07-05 12:47:18
Looks good. Thanks!

I just bought tickets to fly British Airways to South Africa. It cost me BTC 1.054 on cheapair.com.  It was slickidy slick quick and pain free! Psyched!
@_date: 2013-05-16 15:27:44
Ok, maybe that's a stretch, but since there are no logins or anything, we have no personal data to save.  Plus all the chat is deleted permanently as soon as it 'scrolls' off the bottom. Also we don't keep any logs. The private rooms provide the ability for a a high level of privacy, but it goes without saying there are always limits. Hope this helps.

Joe is probably suffering from recurring bitcoin nightmares brought on by a serious case of cognitive dissonance. Hey Joe... (love that song!) if you're listening... I seriously recommend self-flagellation. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 15:22:43
The latter

I hope I am doing this right (I'm a Reddit newbie!) but I'd like to try and get the word out.  Thanks.

True - but doesn't that apply to any chat site? Sorry but I don't believe in cluttering things up with lots of hand holding... never been my thing.

No personal information is requested or required. The only info available is the country of origin.

Really interesting model. Perhaps this is well known (re. crowdfunding/sourcing) but it just hit me that this is exactly how the brain works - whether or not a neuron fires is dependent upon it getting a critical mass (hitting a tipping point) of inputs - multiple inputs, single response.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:15:02
Buy with BITCOIN then repurchase the BTC with $.  This way you support the bitcoin community/economy while still (indirectly) spending your soon to be worthless fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:26:38
I couldn't watch the whole thing, but I'm sure they must be talking about Bitcoin no? Edison's renegade currency? If anyone can survive the full vid please let me know.
EDIT: Ok it's definitely Bitcoin.

I'd say the mtGox flashcrash of 2011 qualifies as a 'classic'.  Take a look at the "Retro" playlist - there are a couple of others, but it's really difficult to search for old youtube videos.

Re. The forest for the trees... I know this doesn't answer any of your questions directly, but I think it is important to grasp the sweeping power of bitcoin.  The following is a quote from Zerohedge.com comments that I believe brings it home:
By Wintermute on Zerohedge: "...Bitcoin is a super-currency because it is the first one to have an inbuilt payment system. It is so powerful that it can potentially replace fiat currencies AND mastercard/paypal/visa etc - at the same time!"
(sorry I lost the original link)
