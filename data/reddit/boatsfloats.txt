If you want to participate in opposing big banks.  Stop being lazy, stop swiping your plastic.  Convert your money to cash and use only cash as much as possible.

FritoLay is allegedly packing dollar bills into bags of Cheetos as some sort of promotion.

Shamir's positions really surprise me, I guess I didn't know enough about him.  He used straw man arguments, implied that bitcoin needed to be backdoored(or front doored) for it to hit "prime time".  He said that police need a way to trace payments to criminals.  It's almost like he isn't as smart as I thought he was and doesn't know how bitcoin works or he has an agenda.

It is a time consuming pain in the butt.

That does not trace them all the way back.

Do you know a website that will show me a tree view of all of the transactions for my coins that lead back to the original mining transaction?
  
For instance, if I had a public key for a 1 btc casascius coin, I'd like to be able to enter the public key and see a tree view of all transactions that led to that 1 btc transaction.

Decentralization and top down control are not mutually exclusive.  His comments express a view point that acknowledges the value, the very existence of a view point expresses acknowledgment of value on some level.
  
But to put the onus for traceability on the protocol itself, the implication that an open ledger in itself isn't enough, is turning a blind eye to what bitcoin is and what makes it successful and appealing to such a wide audience.  Whether that's on purpose or accidental I do not know, but the implications are clear.  The implication is a complete undermining of what bitcoin is and I want to assume that it is far from Satoshi's vision.
  
We do not need to undermine Satoshi's vision to accomplish what Shamir proposes.  This is already happening every day by the likes of the NSA.  It is facilitated by the open ledger and the work of Satoshi.  It should end there and the onus for tracking should be on them, not the protocol.

How is the price of gas determined?  If gas is cheap, why would the value of ether go up?  Sounds like the value of ether will depend on the supply plus the price of gas.  Sounds very interesting and less and less like a threat to bitcoin.

It sounds like whoever creates the contract determines the gas ceiling.  That's pretty cool.  It sounds like ether not gas determines how miners deal with your transactions for the contract and gas is a way to help the people building the contract manage spamming in certain scenarios.. I think..  this is is very confusing!

Is ether a fixed supply or will the supply continue to grow?  I understand that you have to spend ether in order to use the scripting engine built into ethereum, how will they ensure that the price of ether will be affordable enough to use the scipting side of things?

This made me wonder how many people who own bitcoin actually participate in any sort of bitcoin community.
