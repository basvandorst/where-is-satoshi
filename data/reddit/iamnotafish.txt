No, Apple actually had a much more open strategy in the 90s when they were nearing bankruptcy. They even licensed OSX to other PC manufacturers! So that argument is pretty much invalid. Apple was once days away from bankruptcy only because they were under bad management and making absolute shit products.

OSX is free now... You pretty much pay apple money for good design, hardware and customer support. 
I love my MacBook though I run parallels Windows 8 and Ubuntu and I hardly ever see OSX. win win bitches.

LOL this is the stupidest thread I have ever seen. Who gives a fuck what phone people use? Everyone has opinions and preferences. 
Funny thing i noticed lately is that Android fanboys talk about apple more than the apple fanboys.

Why would you even want a world dominated by one OS. Choice is good for consumers. It pushes technology forward. Nothing wrong with apple and Windows having a slice of the mobile pie. The end result is better phones for all of us. 
Christ this thread is a circle jerk

Yeah so don't buy their products. It's simple really. They are not tailoring to users like you. Apple is making fucking billions every year with their current strategy. They have found a market that likes the closed ecosystem approach and they are capitalizing. I don't get what's so hard to understand. I'm an android user too. Apple doesn't have to suit my needs, fuck it I'll buy another android because I like it. I have nothing against Apple users for having different need and tastes.
