Can you make one for me?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:41:45
It’s like a cryptic threat I think 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:44:42
I wish I had the money and knowledge. Must be like printing money...
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:38:32
All the reviews/guides says it takes about 24-48 hours if I had known it would have been longer I would have just used local Bitcoin and ate the costs. 
I don't think there's anything untoward going on. Just super slow with influx of people... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:19:45
Yes I did mean the exchanges. Also what language do you use?
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:16:21
On the bright side it's only 20% and you bought in at a good time so it's kinda like free money. Could have been worse
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:56:48
I've a had a mostly decent experience although I haven't tried to withdraw money yet. 
My only complaint so far is more than one occasion my order was stuck pending and I couldn't not cancel it or anything. My funds was stuck hours after it had gone through for a price I would have cancelled. 
I emails support and they replied days maybe even a week later saying looks like it's fixed. 
High volume or not this isn't good enough especially when your dealing with people's money in a volatile market. It cost me a couple hundred could have been a lot worse.

Can't we all all cooperate and fight back??
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:09:18
Could you elaborate on that wallet :D
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:56:39
Me. And I bought back in even lower. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:04:20
I'm In the same boat as you. Got an email this morning also. From what I hear Coinbase is rather slow especially when they are busy. It sucks cause prices are fluctuating like crazy. If I get an update I'll post back
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:13:30
Disgusting.  every one send me 5000 usd worth of Bitcoin so you won't be tempted by this filth. If I buy all the tickets then no one can sin
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:38:53
Thanks I've got every thing setup and verified. So I'm ready to make a transfer on Monday. I've noticed you can import coins in. So in a pinch I can important coins in if its a weekend as they support litecoin and ether
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:49:15
This is great! do you plan to add Euro and Gemini exchange
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:41:43
How can I get a bot 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:25:56
I've really had enough I'm losing money because my order is pending at least 5 times today it's fucked up and I've made not a penny
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:56:12
Sorry I meant your code. I’m learning to program and think this is an interesting project
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:32:36
Mine has just appeared. I would expect yours to appear today. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:14:32
I think his point is there is no guarantee that it will happen. You could get run over tomorrow but coin could collapse etc. So he'd rather the guaranteed money now. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:49:51
That's what I've been doing and it's been successful for me so far if I had held I would have an extra 200 which with this wall and price drops I can make up
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:02:55
What language did you use? Is the source code available?
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:06:53
Well then you give me some lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:06:08
I've heard of something similar with the additional step of a fire account. This is no longer needed?
My main concern is the days wait when there's a dip. Now I know you shouldn't leave coins in an exchange but this count for fiat currency? Could I leave sterling on the exchange for dips or is that frowned upon?
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:14:23
Thanks! But in the spirit of things I think I need to have some matzi and fully commit to my blunder
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:42:28
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:45:05
Any other tips for us Brits ?
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:02:51
I only have 0.0001 btc... I missed the dip and have been waiting in vain. 
You can have it if you really want it
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:55:19
I like you, you got matzi kid
@_date: 2016-02-18 11:58:22
Because even if a randomly generated key is safe when it becomes complicated to remember people tend to just write it down I've seen so many passwords on post it notes by a pc. So I'm wondering if there is a way to pick an obscure sentence from the word list your self 
@_date: 2016-02-18 12:13:03
Oh I thought it was as simple as choosing words from a word list didn't consider the checksum that would make it even harder to make an easier to remember but still obscure sentence. Thanks for the help
@_date: 2016-02-18 12:18:41
Oh man lol it's hurts my heart I've seen pass phrases stuck on a post it note on the monitor!!! And general passwords left as defaults from the company that every new starter gets etc. And even worse when forced to create a password meeting a specific requirement for example 6 characters 3numbers ... Abc123 so my thinking was as people are clearly lazy and nonchalant maybe make something more meaning full and hopefully they wouldn't be as careless as they can commit it to memory.
