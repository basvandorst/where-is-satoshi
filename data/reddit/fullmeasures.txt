I forgot about that. I've been worried about exchange crackdowns but atomic swaps will negate the need right?

BCH executed level 100 cultism apparently. It's fucking insane lmao. Nick Szabo himself exclaimed how simply adjusting block size was trash.

It's going to get better via implementation of second-layer technologies. YouTube Elizabeth Stark, shes great.

It's all about liquidating your 401k and putting it into HoboNickels

When people talk about scaling bitcoin, its the transaction throughput capabilities. When too many transactions go in the queue, fees also increase, this happened in the spike late 2017. Also something that is often mentioned is how VISA can do insanely more transactions than Bitcoin.\*
\*Maximalist retort: Yeah, for now, but it will scale to be equally viable through further development
Layer two technologies like Lightning Network aim to bundle transactions offchain and then push them through as one (or something relatively similar to that).

Oh, right. lmao

Van life is sweet. Everyone can have their own opinions of course but it bums me out when people dismiss it as a trend of idiocy. I can't wait to have to privilege of untethered minimalism.

If we integrate crypto into 401k and IRA, moon af

Okay now make them less than 100dB in volume

My bad. The way it was phrased made it seem like you needed the annual membership too.
I guess it just also comes along with the membership.

I have a feeling certain people will state otherwise.

The fact that the Casa Node costs $300/year is pretty bleh to me. I like what they're doing in concept but, sheesh

There's a lot of evidence that suggests that, and I believe that as well. Don't wanna blow up his spot though; let him reap the benefit of the relative anonymity.

Hal Finney is only half of Satoshi

I agree with this for the most part, but that hologram one in Miami was worth posting imo. Never seen one like that.
@_date: 2018-07-21 02:21:25
Absolutely. And it's a dumb claim because there's only 10,000 other ways to digitally receive currency in a highly untrackable fashion these days.
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:52:33
Yep, do enough research and it's an easy conclusion. Satoshi is 85&amp; Szabo and 15&amp; Hal Finney who helped him with some of his final issues that evolved Bitgold to Bitcoin. Also he released Bitgold the year before and went radio silent the year of Bitcoin etc, never addressed it as a competitor and so on. There's a few other potential leads/proofs but I can't find the saved Reddit post that outlined it.
Also he has a freudian slip in Tim Ferriss' podcast around an hour and thirty where he says "I made Bitco-..Bitgold"; which could be nothing but yeah.

This may sound nooby but the thing about hardware wallets is it brings a new way to lose it; physically. I could easily see myself losing a usb stick with 50k on it somehow. But more specifically: while traveling. If you keep it in a safe or whatever, cool. But for traveling, wouldn't the best way be putting your desktop wallet passwords in a password protected rar or something on cloud?

I'm glad someone else did. Many would say it's just an honest mistake, but I feel he had gotten too comfortable and [really let it slip](

TIL people think solar is a joke even though it's not and is totally viable
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:15:23
The fact that people don't realize you can use ~0.01 BTC etc is kinda crazy actually. How logical would a currency be where the one dollar bill is $3000? lmao
