Take care of your shit. You don't need a chargeback option, you need common sense. I'd like to say I feel sorry for the guy, but, he probably would have lost / pissed them away anyhow seeing how dim this dude is.
This is also probably a bullshit story. What is the robber's username? Where was this? You would think that the guy would post that info to warn people. So, it's 1) Profound Stupidity 2) Bullshit sob story to get btc 3) Bullshit story to stink up localbitcoins.

Glad you noticed! That's exactly what I was going for.

Hey everyone - I was one the the two artists. If anyone is interested - I'm getting some bad ass prints made. You can order one from my shop here: 
btw - I think this is all in good fun - and the melodrama is a part of that. ;)

For what it's worth, I've used the Waves atm in Vancouver often to purchase btc. A couple times, there were small hiccups with the exchange (bitstamp), but there was always someone there to fill me in on what the wrinkle was, and every time my order was eventually filled. If it wasn't for this atm, I probably wouldn't have any bitcoins- so for that, I'm very grateful and give the operators a big thumbs up.

Glad you guys enjoy the piece. It was a lot of fun to do.

Once upon a time - yeah - Bill Maher would have been great - however, entertainers like him and Jon Stewart / Colbert are all just mouthpieces for the state. They just pander to know-nothing tools who unfortunately get all their info in tiny soundbites from comedians. Which is a shame - because I do think some of these people are funny. That being said - I think appearances on Rogan's show are almost more effective then being drug out on a comedy show and be spliced into a 60 second bit to look like a kook. You gotta remember - guys like Bill Maher are 100% behind crooks in power (they help personally fund the propaganda and make it a part of their shows). If he had Andreas on, it would be to try and make him (and those who are into Bitcoin) look like goofs.

I never asked for tips. I simply answered the 'who made this' question. Which is me. I think. Pretty sure it's me.

In Canada - signed up, funded account, and sent to my blockchain wallet all in about 3 minutes.
Service fee of about $11 USD per coin. There's also a limit of only $500 / week using CC. All in all... Circle is amazing. Super slick and idiot proof.
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:33:25
I made this! For realz.

I haven't ordered from Agora - but probably will in the future. Silvergoldbull.com also accepts btc - I've been ordering form them for years (and recently been paying with btc) - great selection, excellent prices, and incredibly awesome customer service.
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:30:03
Yup - I have them here:

Thanks! My first tip! Funny how the guy who posts the image rakes in the tips vs the person who actually painted the thing.

That would be me!

Please stop asking and petitioning Apple to reverse their decision. They're not your dad. Stop 'asking' for things - just act by dumping their crap. And if you have a boner for Steve Jobs, he has as much to do with Apple as Walt Disney does with Disney. Stop giving them your money. Need to start rebranding "Apple" as a joke.

It's a 5 min walk from where I live - so, convenience. If it wasn't there then I would use localbitcoins (or something else) for sure. Around the time that I decided to take the plunge and buy some was coincidentally right as the atm was installed. Although - for a lot of people, I think an atm feels kind of ...psychologically legit... (?) It removes the barrier of having to deal with banks and/or people. All that's required is stuffing money into a machine. The more ATMs that pop up the better it is for btc - it's that common ease of access instead of the 'hey, I can hook you up' thing. I use the Mom Test. I can see my mom using the atm, no problem. I can't imagine my mom arranging a meeting with a stranger on Localbitcoins.

I'm wondering if OB may be useful for me.  I self-publish comics and sell PDFs through my online BigCartel + Pulley store. Customer buys, payment goes through, they get a link to the product to download. Can OB do this?
(Little side note, speaking of comics... I may have been the first person to sell comics for Bitcoin back at a Vancouver comic con back in April of 2014. It through up an "I accept BTC" sign as an experiment and was quite happy to have ONE person know what it was and use it. I claim dibs!)

I live in Berlin also, but sadly I don't resemble this painful Justin Bieber looking douche they're looking for:
I don't think I could handle this much hipster.
@_date: 2016-02-19 00:52:22
Hoping I can link from my current site to the OB store. Currently, I spend $30 CAD in on my store / month. (Big Cartel $10 + Pulley $20)

Governments / banks (Goverbanks?... does that work?) will continue to throw stink on Bitcoin, just like they do with precious metals. India is having a tough time with the faith of their currency, and they will also crack down on Bitcoin as they've done with gold - so - don't expect India to give it the thumbs up anytime soon - even if there's a trickle of news from India on Bitcoin. In fact no gov't anywhere will throw a parade for BTC as it attacks currency velocity. Best way to think about it as as a commodity vehicle used for trade / speculation - which I think is fine. A lot of people (including Ben Bernanke) don't think gold is money either. However, no country will ever be "out" of the Bitcoin game - because it's like trying to stop P2P - you can't.

Update: Problem seems to be resolved. I never heard back from Cryptsy, however, I am now able to log in. Odd. A little wary about it now, but, could be because of their massive growth. Anyhow - thanks guys/girls
