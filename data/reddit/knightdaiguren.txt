I've seen that it can be with enough rigs and everything but ive just starting out and just trying to make a little bit of extra spending money and that $45 a month is based on other miners using the same gpu as me.

I'm just getting into it so for right now I'm using nicehash (I have my own wallet set up). Ive only been able to numbers from there but I've tried coinwarz as well but they dont go based off hash rates so idk where else to check.

Hey new to cryptocurrency mining. In having trouble deciding on a wallet to use. I haven't started mining just yet cause I was wanting to use nicehash when it came back up unless soneone knew of a better alternative that shows daily earnings as I'm mining and can benchmark my pc.
Now the question about the wallet is that I wouldnt be making very much starting out (about $45 a month with my current build) so was thinking something I can use on my pc and my phone would suffice for now and once I build a better rig that can earn me more get a hardware wallet (though don't fully understand them like how often to plug it in and add more to it). Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Yea the nicehash calculator only shows the 6gb card as an option to check and its currently showing 2.73 a day.

So I'm looking into using a 1060 for mining. Does it matter which model I go with? I see most people on YouTube using dual fan cards wasnt sure if single fan cards were just as good or not worth the time.
