Nitrogensports.eu has had my business for some time now when I feel the urge to be a degenerate. They work in 100% bitcoin and have a much more professional interface than this place.
If you really want the utility of Bitcoin to smack you in the face, try making a $10 deposit and then a $10 withdrawal on bovada.lv, sportsbook.ag, topbet.com.... etc, and then compare those processes and costs to using nitrogensports.eu. It's truly impossible to ignore the benefits Bitcoin has in the gambling world once you do that.

@_date: 2015-06-23 20:15:44
Fair enough.
Another interpretation would be that 40% of those customers wanted to trade away their fiat and hold on to their Bitcoin.
If spending it and then repurchasing it didn't cost me 1% at coinbase, then I'd certainly use Bitcoin. If we weren't only 50% away from our 18 month low, I'd certainly use Bitcoin. If I got some of my salary paid in Bitcoin, then I'd certainly use it.
I'm sure some people are reading this and saying "See! That's why a deflationary currency doesn't work!"
I view it as digital gold though, and an alternative to fiat. I don't really care how much other people are spending it. When enough people don't want to spend it, then the price should go up until people want to spend it again. If we all stopped spending it, the price would go up, not down...
Iono... it's weird lol. Should be interesting to see how it does.

My goals for Bitcoin aren't really that ambitious.
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:25:48
I disagree.
Why are these venture capitalists pouring money into these Bitcoin companies instead of just buying up Bitcoin? It's because they don't have any better idea of where the price is going, or how this experiment will do in the long run than you or I do.
Coinbase, circle, 21, etc. all offer business models that are not completely pegged to Bitcoin. If Bitcoin fails, these companies will easily be able to concentrate their efforts on another cryptocurrency.
Think about it this way, why would people invest in a company that is spending that money on Bitcoin? Why wouldn't they just buy the Bitcoin themselves and cut out the middle man?

Well the IRS is going to want to know where your coins are moving forward, so that they can come for your money when you do sell them.
Sadly, the best thing we have going for us right now is that for the last 18 months, most people who bought BTC on coinbase probably saw those coins decline in value since they bought them, meaning the IRS has more money to lose by pursuing all these people than gain.
I have zero doubt that anyone who has ever bought or sold BT con coinbase is 100% on an IRS list and probably FBI list as well. Guaranteed. How they will use those lists is the question.
@_date: 2015-05-06 19:10:22
I honestly figure they just give it over regardless if they really need to or not. They have shown where they stand on all of this pretty clearly. They aren't in it to support the ideologies behind Bitcoin, they are in it to make money without getting in trouble.

Also, don't the block halvings help fight this problem? If the price doubles, and the amount of coins mined halves, wouldn't the amount of energy/money the miners are willing to burn stay the same?

For [10], is it possible to estimate the amount of power used each day to mine Bitcoin?

The volatility argument always baffles me. Of course it's volatile. If it wasn't volatile, it would already be a success.
21 million of something valued at ~$240 each with plenty of ways for people to buy and sell them = volatile as fug.
@_date: 2015-05-21 19:14:01

Well they aren't paying the electrical bills that most miners pay right? So their cost to mine Bitcoins would essentially be the cost to manufacture the chips.
@_date: 2015-05-28 20:38:29
Don't services like Bitpay basically negate that entire risk for merchants?
I think stability is a necessary phase before a bounce back, but I don't think it really has anything at all to do with people thinking Bitcoin is stable. I think it's just the market coming to a consensus on where the bottom is.

The price is where it was about 19 months ago. If we were going to fit this graph to the 6 year period, then we are either in the late majority phase, or the early adopters were people that bought in 20 months ago. Your conclusion is no more accurate than OP's, and both are speculating as to what will happen in the future.
I never fail to be amused by the long term holders such as yourself who have admitted to holding a significant amount of BTC, yet continually try to play devil's advocate in hopes that someone will come along and be able to convince them that they should in fact be bullish. 
Case in point,guy who has admitted to holding upwards of 40 BTC saying:


What you are really asking is, "Can one of you help me to hold confidence in my losing position?" We all go out and seek to find data, opinions, and draw graphs that support our own narrative. however, on reddit, and especially with Bitcoin, you often see people seek that support through the means of arguing with people on their same side, in hopes that their narrative will ultimately be reenforced by someone out-arguing them.
Cracks me up. I've done it too though. It's an interesting insight into the psychology of investing, more specifically, the psychology of investing in something and then holding the bag while the price just keeps dropping.
@_date: 2015-05-29 18:10:41
If Bitcoin ever truly fails, that would be a humongous step backwards for all cryptocurrencies. Good luck convincing people that the new version of the thing they didn't understand before is somehow going to be different.

Some magical post is going to suddenly make people hand their money over to you by buying up Bitcoin?
I understand that it's not technically a zero-sum game, but at this point, you have to realize that the money we are all hoping to make off of Bitcoin has to come from somewhere. People keep thinking it will be wall-street, but I don't think they are stupid enough to just hand over their money like that.
I think that if the price does explode, it will be the result of lots of averages joes trying to buy in after the price has already been shooting up, similar to last time. Maybe some magical post in here gets the trend to reverse, and the FOMO buyers start showing up, but I can't imagine what that post would possibly be.

Shrem/Karp didn't pay off the right people.
The even funnier part to me is that they will have to pay this fine to the government. They stole lots of money from people, and their punishment is to give some of that stolen money to the government? No wonder the government has no interest in shutting them down.

Just saying, you can throw all the positive news in buttcoiner's faces all you want. We've been doing it for over a year. The price keeps crashing, and the vast majority of us keep losing money.
I'm guessing that you are implying that you got in at prices lower than the current price today, but that doesn't mean you aren't losing money when the price drops from it's current level. That would be a sunk cost fallacy.

I'm just waiting for all of the reports of Coinbase turning people's infro over to the IRS as well. When the IRS comes to you and asks where all the Bitcoins you bought form coinbase are, what are you gonna say? I lost them? I sold them while I operated as an illigal MSB? I sent them to a shady exchange?

I've always wondered if you could say "Well I sold them all for a total of $10 to some hobo on the streets. Can I get a tax deduction?"
I say we all start doing this. Write each other receipts for buying lots of Bitcoins for $10, then that person just has to 'lose' them. One person gets a tax reduction and the other doesn't have to pay a thing. If we all did this enough, maybe the IRS would realize that trying to tax Bitcoin is a losing proposition.

Honestly, coinbase isn't going to rip you off, and they won't lose your coins. They are federally insured, I believe, but I might be wrong.
If you have a small amount of coins and want to be able to easily sell them at any moment, I think storing them on there is your best option.
EDIT: The number one thing I've always resented about this community is their unreasonable hatred towards coinbase. Coinbase has brought more legitimacy to Bitcoin than any other Bitcoin company out there by miles, period. People complain when they are stupid enough to try to use them to buy their dark market drugs or gamble.

Overheads =/= no profit
I never said that had to pay a lot on it.
How does that tax free savings account do after inflation?
None of this changes the fact that the banks are dependent on you keeping your money with them in order to make money. You are doing them a favor by letting them hang on to it. They return the favor in the form of keeping it safe and federally insured. I think that when people start learning they can be their own bank, banks will happily offer to pay people real interest so they can hold their money for them.

Ha well said.
I agree completely that some people will never ever want to manage their own money. The vast majority of people won't. Hell, if I had enough, I wouldn't trust myself to keep it all safe.
What I'm getting at is when there is a possibility for more people to be their own banks or be banks for other people (coinbase) as a result of Bitcoin, that brings more competition to the banks' doorsteps. When there is more competition, that is generally good for the consumers, regardless of which path they wanna go with.

On top of this, drivers get to rest assured that if their passenger throws up in their car or somehow causes damage to their vehicle, they get to charge the passengers credit card for the damages.

True, but in reality they should be paying you solid interest on whatever is in your account.

Off the top of my head I think maybe 200k coins were seized by Japan's government. I think that is all of the coins they had.
The other few hundred thousand never existed. Coins were stolen or lost, and he planned on paying back those coins by selling non existent coins in hopes that the price would go down and he could buy back those non existent coins, and some real coins for cheaper.
Correct me where I'm wrong please, but that was my understanding of it.

No, the answer should always be "It doesn't matter what backs a currency, but who controls the quantity."
The US dollar is backed by debt, and that is 100% fine. Currencies backed by debt can work just fine.  Currencies backed by absolutely nothing can work just fine. All that is needed is for a majority to say "Ok, that's an acceptable medium of trade." The problem is that they have complete control over the supply.
People think there is a need for a currency to be backed by something, but that is simply not the case. 
Check these out for a good example of a currency that the UK thrived on which had absolutely no backing whatsoever.

No it's not. I understand why you may think that a currency has to be backed by something tangible, but it simply does not. I encourage you to read the wiki article I gave.
I also encourage you to watch "The truth behind the yellow brick road" on youtube. It's 2 hours long and not super thrilling but it's ONE HELL of a history of currencies all over the world.


All of those things help to persuade adoption. That is not the same as backing something. BTC is not tied to any of those things directly at a fixed rate.

Someone simply sets up a business where they setup an address with upwards of 100,000 BTC at all times. 
The business lets other people send their Bitcoins to that address and then withdraw them from that address in other denominations a few days later.
For example, you send 500 BTC to that address, 4 days later they send 100 BTC to 5 different addresses you own. Good luck proving they are yours now.
The problem here is trusting this business and somebody running this business legally.

This is why it's a great time to be on the sidelines right now. Whether the price goes up or down, it doesn't affect me. All I have to risk is "missing out."

The value of the currency, by your measure of its network of users, has been steadily growing for this entire downtrend.

It's designed to be deflationary eventually. Right now, it is absurdly inflationary. 
Satoshi didn't want all Bitcoins to be premined, because that seems like a huge scam and miners would have no incentive to run the network. He also wanted the currency to be deflationary eventually. Therefore, he chose a solution in which the inflation rate would halve every once in a while. Right now there are 3600 BTC produced a day on average. Sometime in mid 2016, that number will drop to 1800. This will continue until a negligible amount of new coins are being mined every year.
@_date: 2015-04-15 14:32:38

@_date: 2015-04-14 18:27:47


Ugh this is just so incorrect. The number of holders needs to go up. The number of people who accept BTC for goods at their store and then don't immediately exchange them for cash. We could have millions of people go to coinbase, but BTC, buy something on overstock, and repeat every week, and it would do absolutely nothing for the price.
The price goes up when people stop selling. Buying goods with BTC right now is selling! In fact, with the 1% coinbase fees and whatnot, buying with BTC right now is selling below market value!
Currently 3600 BTC/day needs to be bought up and **held** for the price to even remain at it's current level!

Just further indication of how hard it still is for people to buy Bitcoin at any reasonable rate. BTM? 5%+ markup at a minimum. Localbitcoins? 4%-7% markup depending on if you buy it with cash in person or not. Coinbase? 1% and they will monitor and report every little thing you do.
Merchant adoption and methods through which to sell coins at good rates are both developing well though. Hence downtrend IMO.

Here is how I did it:
I would only work with other accounts that had a verified phone number at the least. I would set up my advertisements on LBC for various locations near my city saying that I would sell BTC for cash at a markup, but still the best price in the area. They contact me with how much they want (I usually limited it to $2000 max), then we exchange phone number, arrange a time to meet at starbucks, and when we get there, they give me cash, I count it, and then I send the BTC to their desired address.
Whoever receives their side of the bargain second is at risk in the process obviously, but a record of 100% positive feedback helps to gain some trust. If neither person has positive feedback, then just feel the person out and maybe use localbitcoins to send the BTC from user to user or maybe even use their escrow service if you want, but I never did. I usually tried to only use LBC for getting to the point of exchanging numbers, and then I would go around them so I didn't have to pay the 1% fee they charge for user -&gt; user transactions.
Generally they would send me the address they wanted via text message while we are there, and I would just copy and paste it into the receiving address field. 
Really it's pretty straightforward.
TL;DR Feel out the situation. Once you or both users have positive feedback on your account from a few transactions, that's enough to warrant a bit of trust, which will give them confidence to hand you the money first. If you have a brand new account, maybe use the escrow service.
