For a currency marked by volatility, Bitcoin has been remarkably stable against the U.S. Dollar over the last couple of months, essentially trading in a $320-$420 range. For those attracted to the virtual currency as a trading instrument due to massive volatility in the past that is no doubt a disappointment, but to those who are more interested in the blockchain as a game-changing payment system and the currency as a potential store of value in an inflationary environment, it is welcome news.
They would argue that this relative stability is a sign of maturity in the market, while those who look for the negative in anything to do with crypto-currencies would no doubt claim it is a sign of a growing indifference. To some extent, both may be right, but either way it is a good thing for Bitcoin’s long term prospects.
Of course, a trading range of 30 percent or so still represents enough volatility to keep even the most ardent currency trader occupied, but after establishing those levels of support and resistance BTC/USD has begun to narrow its own range and has spent the last week or so hovering around the mid-point of $370.
The above chart, from Bitcoincharts.com, also shoes volume bars at the bottom. As you can see, volume has been steady, low and declining for several weeks. Some of this may be down to the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S., but it is more than a one-day phenomenon. What makes the lack of movement and declining volume of trades even more remarkable is that it has come at a time when commodity markets, most notably oil, have been under pressure. In many ways, Bitcoin’s known and finite supply makes it more like a commodity than a currency, but as other commodities have lost ground to the Dollar, BTC has stabilized.
Could it be, then, that as money has shifted away from inflated, risky assets such as oil and gold and run away from fiat currencies that are being deliberately devalued by central banks around the world, Bitcoin is seen by some as somewhat of a safe haven? That would certainly fit with the stability against the traditional safe haven, the U.S. Dollar.
That could be the case if not for one thing; that low volume. That would suggest that far from flocking to Bitcoin as a safe haven, global cash is essentially ignoring it. If that is the case then the next logical conclusion is that this $370 level represents the real value of BTC in USD terms at this point in its evolution. As anybody with a basic understanding of economics can tell you the price of something is a reflection of supply and demand and price stability comes when they are in balance. Given the evidence, the most likely scenario is that that is the case with Bitcoin right now.
The jump up in price to the giddy highs of over $1100 at the end of last year brought a lot of publicity and increased awareness to the Bitcoin market. This attracted more miners and effectively increased the rate of supply, so a drop in price was somewhat inevitable. Mining Bitcoin, though, gets more difficult, and therefore more costly, by design with the passage of time. The rate of supply is thus inexorably reduced, but the overall supply continues to increase. This price stability suggests that the overall supply is now at a point that is enough to satisfy demand but there is not an excess of coins in circulation.
Given that, the continuing decline in the rate of supply and a tendency for demand to increase as stability takes hold, there is, in the long term, only one way for BTC/USD to move...up.
All of this, of course, assumes that education and awareness continues and more and more people understand the benefit of making and receiving payments through the blockchain at minimal cost. It also assumes that there will be no en masse speculative selling by traders as maturity and the accompanying derivatives make shorting easier. If those two assumptions are correct we are left with a situation where owning at least some Bitcoin makes sense for every long term investor, not just believers and speculators.
When asked over the holiday why that is the case, I put it this way. If you have $375 that you want to leave, in cash, for your great-grandchildren, you have a choice. You could lock the Dollars away somewhere in the certain knowledge that by the time that future generation accesses them they will be virtually worthless, or you could purchase 1 Bitcoin and store it in a digital wallet. If Bitcoin fails you have the same result, but if stability continues and is a sign of maturity then that future generation will be thanking you forever. That seems like a risk/reward ratio too good to turn down

The U.S. Marshals Service said that it received 27 bids in an auction for 50,000 bitcoin that were seized last year as part of the government shutdown of Silk Road, an online black market.
It said the auction, which was held on Thursday, drew 11 registered bidders for the bitcoin, which were being sold in 20 blocks. Bidders were permitted to bid on multiple groups of the bitcoin.
“Bids are being reviewed, and the auction is in the evaluation process,” the Marshals Service said in a statement. The service is a unit of the Department of Justice.

BitBeat: Lyn Ulbricht Blasts Government Overreach in Her Son’s Case  
The 50,000 bitcoin had a market value of $18.6 million based on Thursday’s bitcoin price of $372.12 on the CoinDesk price index.
The government conducted an auction of nearly 30,000 of seized Silk Road bitcoin in the summer. The winning bidder for those bitcoin was Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper, who has said he was planning to bid in this week’s auction as well.
Prosecutors have said that Silk Road was an online bazaar in which buyers used bitcoin to buy drugs and illegal goods and services. The federal trial of accused Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht is set to begin in New York next month.
Mr. Ulbricht, 30 years old, has pleaded not guilty to a variety of drug, hacking and conspiracy charges.

I discovered bitcoin on May 13, 2011 and never recovered. After developing a reputation as the bitcoin guy at the physics department, I eventually quit my physics PhD program and went full-time bitcoin. I worked for the best bitcoin company in the world, BitPay, but couldn't pass up an opportunity to bring bitcoin to millions of reddit users. I'm working on reddit's digital asset, as well as general purpose bitcoin infrastructure to enable things like micropayments and contracts. My favorite things are elliptic curves, hash functions, and Merkle trees. My favorite subreddits are and If I had written bitcoin, it would have been in javascript.

On Wednesday, BitPay announced that it was partnering with Euro Pacific in an arrangement that will allow customers to spend bitcoin in exchange for precious metals. But Schiff maintains that there has been no change in his thinking.

Bitcoin will change a lot more than finance. It could also change how software is built and upend a bunch of today's biggest web companies, argues Joel Monegro of Union Square Ventures.
His argument starts with the block chain, the shared ledger where every Bitcoin transaction is recorded. Validating these transactions requires computing power. When each transaction is validated, a new block is added to the chain, which makes future transactions even harder to compute.
Bitcoin was designed this way to make sure that the same Bitcoin, which has no physical form, isn't spent twice by the same person. This also gives Bitcoin some inherent value — people or organizations have to spend a lot of money to run the computers that validate transactions, and the complexity of those computations is always increasing as the chain gets longer. 
But Monegro argues that these technical underpinnings of the Bitcoin system may have more long-term potential than the currency itself.
That's because the block chain is not controlled by any one person or entity, and information in it is freely available to other software programs. So programmers are starting to build things on top of the block chain that have nothing to do with digital currency. 
For instance, some programmers have developed a protocol called La'Zooz for real-time ride sharing. That could eventually disrupt Uber. Others have created OpenBazaar, a protocol for a a peer-to-peer trading network that could disrupt eBay. Both use the block chain for some basic computing tasks.
Here's a simple way of thinking about it. The block chain itself is immutable, like bedrock.  Bitcoin is like a building on top of that bedrock — it's got a foundation where programmers have defined some of the basics of how it works, then a bunch of stories on top of that where people interact with it.
But it's now possible for other folks to build their own buildings on top of the same bedrock.
"The block chain is great at two fundamental things," explains Monegro. "Distributed consensus, which is basically having a large network of computers agree on a value of something....that's a key component for any decentralized system. The other thing is time-stamping, holding a chronological order of things happening." 
As new businesses crop up that depend on these functions, they'll benefit from turning to the Bitcoin block chain, rather than having to build a similar system from scratch.
This concept isn't new. Many tech companies have technology platforms that others can build on, from Microsoft to Google to Facebook. 
The Bitcoin block chain is different because everything underlying it is published, and there's no central controlling entity. The whole system works only because all the participants abide by the same set of rules, and any changes are dictated by hard math rather than a CEO or board of directors.
"Facebook wants to own and store the data that is relevant to their operation," says Monegro. "So does Google, so does everyone else. The data they store, they control it. The algorithms they run, they control it to serve their own purposes. A system like this, the protocols you build are open, not controlled by anybody. They work like a machine. They don't discriminate."
There's still reason to be skeptical. Bitcoin itself is still in a very early and tumultuous stage, as the collapse of the Mt. Gox exchange earlier this year showed. Speculation has caused some pretty wild price fluctuations — one Bitcoin is worth about $375 today, down from a peak of $1,242 in March 2013. That makes it an unreliable store of value, which could eventually drive people away.
Plus, the organizations building on top of the block chain tend to speak in utopian terms that could be a turn-off for outsiders. For instance, La'Zooz describes itself as "a completely decentralized and autonomous organisation. That means that anyone can contribute towards the establishment of its goals in whatever way he or she believes would be the best. Tasks are carried out within autonomous, self-defined circles or teams."
But that kind of utopian vision is how a lot of open-source projects started, and many of them have grown into essential technology. Take the Linux operating system, which runs most of the computers in the biggest data centers in the world, like your bank. Or Apache, which runs the majority of web servers. Or the protocols that formed the basis of the Internet itself.
Monegro and USV's Fred Wilson think that Bitcoin could become the same kind of foundational building block within the next 5 to 10 years.
Monegro's entire post is worth reading if you're interested in the technical vision. Here's a graphic showing the different layers of the platform he believes will built on the block chain, which he's going to detail in a set of follow-up posts:

A commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Monday that the agency was authorized to intervene with enforcement actions against price manipulation in bitcoin markets.
“It has not been tested, but I do believe we have the authority because if you think of any reasonable reading of our statute, bitcoin classifies as a commodity,” said CFTC Commissioner Mark P. Wetjen during a panel discussion at a seminar on the digital currency organized by Bloomberg in New York. “This gives us the authority to bring enforcement against any type of manipulation.” He added that the CFTC statute’s definition of a commodity is very broad.
During the same panel, the director of the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Jennifer Shasky Calvery, praised the work of New York’s Department of Financial Services in developing its so-called BitLicense, a proposed specialized license for bitcoin-related businesses operating in the state.
“I’m heartened by the fact that we have a state like New York, and other states, that are issuing license and trying to think through some of the issues,” she said. “It seems that the process has been open and iterative to the public with different rounds of comments.”
An early draft of the BitLicense prompted a backlash from members of the bitcoin community, with the proposal criticized by many for being a threat to innovation. And although New York Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin M. Lawsky has since signaled that the final version would likely have a softer regulatory touch, the BitLicense remains a controversial issue.
Ms. Calvery also said more than 100 bitcoin businesses had registered with FinCEN and that she was encouraged by the quality of their reporting on suspicious activities.
Asked by moderator Jerry Brito, the director of Washington-based think tank the Coin Center, about how best to deal with the challenges bitcoin companies face in getting banks to provide them with services, Ms. Calvery said those companies can win bankers’ trust if they are committed to being compliant with regulatory demands.
“One of the things I’ve been hearing from banks…is that they are concerned about the industry and whether it is regulated enough and how they control for their own risks,” she said.
Participating in the same panel, former Securities and Exchange Commissioner Arthur Levitt urged bitcoin companies to take a less combative approach against regulation.
“In today’s world, having a compliance officer is a mark of professionalism and I think the cryptocurrency industry views a compliance officer as a cousin of the devil himself,” said Mr. Levitt. “I think that’s wrong because we are in a steep learning curve and there is no better way to adjust irrational misunderstandings and regulations than by having this kind of transparency.”

SAN MATEO, Calif.—For three months this summer and fall, in an open-plan office here stocked with Red Bull and ramen noodles, Brian Gamido and a couple dozen other true believers toiled at what he conceded sounds like “a pipe dream”—building viable businesses based on bitcoin.
But this bitcoin boot camp was hardly a shoestring effort: Mr. Gamido and the other fledgling entrepreneurs were bankrolled in part by one of Silicon Valley’s most storied families, which has emerged as among the alternative currency’s biggest supporters.
The program, called Boost, was founded by 28-year-old Adam Draper. His father, Tim Draper, is founding partner in Draper Fisher Jurvetson, the venture-capital firm that helped back Skype and Tesla, among others.
Tim Draper, 56 years old, is also one of the world’s largest bitcoin holders after winning a government auction of nearly 30,000 bitcoin this summer.
 
Boost, founded in 2012 to incubate a range of startups, is increasingly focused on bitcoin, helping to develop business plans and connect bitcoin-focused entrepreneurs with potential investors. It aims to take the virtual currency beyond the initial enthusiasts who mostly embraced libertarian philosophies and build profitable companies.
Mr. Gamido, a 33-year-old former management consultant, is one of the hopeful tycoons who eagerly signed up and accepted a small investment by Boost in exchange for a slice of the businesses they create.
“It was hard to walk away from the salary, but building a company was more meaningful to me,” said the California native, whose is embracing his heritage by starting a bitcoin money-transfer company for the Philippines. He said his parents, who turned “ghost-white” when they learned he was quitting his previous job, are now supportive of his venture.
Launched in 2009, bitcoin is an electronic currency that isn’t backed by a central bank or government. Instead, users can buy, sell and swap bitcoin by transferring it among electronic wallets.
Optimism about bitcoin has persisted despite a 60% drop in the currency’s price over the past 12 months, driven largely by the failure of a bitcoin exchange in Japan, regulatory 
concerns and criticism that the currency is used for illegal activity.
In the most recent Boost program, for example, 700 applied to get in, up from 60 applications when the program first started. Only 4% were admitted in the last session, and most had plans related to bitcoin. 
Last week, Boost announced that its next session will be all-Bitcoin, with about 20 to 30 companies in the group.
The elder Draper believes he is getting in on the ground floor.
“I am looking at this as a great long-term opportunity,” said Tim Draper, who plans to bid for more bitcoin at an auction on Thursday. “I don’t know exactly where the bottom is, but we are probably close to it.”
Few argue with that sentiment at Boost, where Adam Draper showed up one day clad in bright orange sneakers and jeans with a black T-shirt emblazoned with the Boost logo. Mr. Draper, who wants to fund 100 bitcoin companies within three years, said he chooses applicants to join his “tribe” based on their vision and how much they can use the money.
The younger Mr. Draper, who recently raised more than $6 million from investors to fund Boost, benefits if the companies strike bitcoin gold. Boost invests $10,000 to $20,000 for a 6% stake in each company selected for the boot camp.
The participants even bunk together at a dormlike hotel, owned by Tim Draper, across the street from the Boost offices.
Catheryne Nicholson was one of the ones who made the cut. One recent Tuesday, the former naval officer and mother of two joined other Boost entrepreneurs preparing for a presentation in front of 100 potential investors.
Her company, called BlockCypher, hopes to find a niche essentially providing the picks and shovels for developers trying to build bitcoin applications. Despite bitcoin investors’ travails, she said the public ledger that tracks bitcoin transactions is “here to stay.”

Nearby, Matt Slater, 23, was listening to white noise through earbuds while reviewing the slides for his presentation about Hedgy, a company that develops financial derivatives for bitcoin so that investors can be protected against the volatility that has roiled prices in recent months.
Mr. Slater, Hedgy’s chief executive officer, shared one of the dorm rooms with Warren
Paul Anderson, who is in charge of the fledgling company’s product and design. “I’m older so I’m in the bottom bunk,” said Mr. Anderson, who entertained the group by taking pictures of those who fall asleep in the office.
Behind them sat Yusho Liu, who moved to California from Singapore to join the program, where he was developing a trading exchange for his country. 
Like other investors, Mr. Liu lost some bitcoin when a Japan exchange known as Mt. Gox collapsed earlier year. He now hopes to improve on Mt. Gox, which he said was difficult to use in addition to losing money.
The months of preparation culminated in late October on “Demo Day,” as the group boarded a bus for a 20-minute ride to meet potential investors at the Menlo Circus Country Club in Atherton, Calif.
One by one, the executives took the stage to make their four-minute pitch, most wearing brightly colored T-shirts with company names emblazoned on the chest. Some wore blazers or a suit jacket. Two were barefoot.
Peter Bodine, a managing director at Allegis Capital, was intrigued by the lineup even though he said investing in these types of companies is like “owning a high-priced stock that is all over the place.” He is hesitant to invest in bitcoin but wants to keep track of fledgling firms. “Would I put my retirement money into it? Not a chance.”

U.S. authorities have opened a new front in their investigation into bitcoin exchanges and other businesses that deal in the online currency, examining possible ties between the firms and the online drug bazaar Silk Road, according to people familiar with the matter.
The new focus of the investigation is the latest indication of how the shuttered online drug market has become linked to bitcoin, tainting the currency with associations of shady activity as its advocates stress to regulators its legitimacy. It comes after prosecutors in January criminally charged the owner of one bitcoin exchange over alleged ties to Silk road.
One of the people familiar with the matter said the investigation was at an early stage, and conclusions hadn't been reached as to whether or not the exchanges were connected with Silk Road.
Several bitcoin exchanges received subpoenas from Manhattan federal prosecutors this winter, including Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the world's most popular bitcoin exchange, according to people familiar with the matter. It wasn't clear which other bitcoin businesses have received subpoenas.

 REUTERS 
The subpoenas to Mt. Gox demanded customer-transaction logs and materials related to solicitation of investors. But prosecutors and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents are also examining whether the exchange and others like it may have processed transactions connected to Silk Road, the people said. Attorneys for Mt. Gox didn't respond to requests for comment.
Mt. Gox suspended trading on Feb. 25 and announced the disappearance of 850,000 bitcoin—about 7% of the world's total—worth more than $470 million at the time. The exchange filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in Texas in March in a bid to stop customers from targeting the cash it holds in U.S. bank accounts.
Mt. Gox's demise amplified authorities' concerns about the stability of bitcoin, which isn't backed by any central bank.
The shadow of Silk Road, where users could anonymously purchase everything from narcotics to forged passports, has long hung over bitcoin, the only form of currency Silk Road accepted.
Exchanging other currencies into bitcoin with the knowledge that the funds would be used for illegal transactions could violate money-laundering laws. Even without such direct knowledge, financial institutions are required under U.S. bank regulations to maintain robust internal controls to prevent money laundering by customers.
Prosecutors shut down Silk Road last year and charged its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht, with several counts of conspiracy and other charges. He has pleaded not guilty and denied being Silk Road's founder. A trial is scheduled for November in federal court in Manhattan. A lawyer for Mr. Ulbricht declined this week to comment.
Charles Shrem, a bitcoin evangelist and businessman, was criminally charged in January with money laundering at his company, BitInstant, which like Mt. Gox swapped dollars for bitcoin and collected a fee on the transactions. Prosecutors alleged he conspired to help customers of Silk Road convert dollars into bitcoin to use on the market.
Emails Mr. Shrem sent furthered suspicions about connections his company may have had with Silk Road, a person briefed on the investigation said.
In an email to an unnamed person in April 2012, cited in court documents filed by prosecutors, Mr. Shrem said that "[Silk Road] funds a decent percentage of the overall Bitcoin economy."
In a February 2012 email cited by prosecutors, Mr. Shrem wrote "wow, Silk Road actually works," explaining he had just received a shipment of marijuana brownies.
Mr. Shrem and his alleged accomplice pleaded not guilty last month in federal court in Manhattan. A trial is scheduled for September. 
"He's cooperated with law-enforcement agencies in the past, and he looks forward to getting this case behind him," said Marc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Mr. Shrem.
