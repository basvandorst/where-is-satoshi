Yes to all this. Never cut your losses, always pump all of your money into it. It doesn't matter if you lose because your average is lower. Right?

Yes very smart I like you. Go US and A

I don't see what's wrong with what they said though.

It's funny how you guys trust past data and charts for your analysis while completely disregarding the macroeconomic situation. It's a bit like believing in voodoo.

There's no reason why we couldn't keep up with the current banking system (which doesn't print infinite money). If you're talking about the fractional system, it is offset by inflation which is about 2% per annum.
Why do you think something has to go down? What exactly can Bitcoin solve here?
Saying that U.S stocks and bonds are both in a bubble is contradictory and shows your lack of knowledge in the financial system.

You forget that the only reason it was priced so high was because of the hype. Stupid money went in, and then out. Do you really expect them to come back in? They've moved on.
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:39:54
That's wrong. You could have said the same thing about every trend or hype ever. There's always a point where there's a popularity peak, followed by the downfall. 
People won't be coming whether it is for Segwit or the Lighting Network. They don't care. Bitcoin won't be adopted as a currency until it can bring the businesses and the public immediate exchange value that would offset, by a large enough margin, the psychological and financial costs of changing the currency of use. Since there's really not much of a problem with fiat money except that it's centralized (it could even be argued that it's not a problem), I just don't see that happening.
The money that was in Bitcoin and still is, consist almost entirely of speculative money. The common folk doesn't think of Bitcoin as a good "get rich quick" scheme anymore. They've moved on.

These issues will arise with any commercial organizations that lend money as it seeks profit. Are you suggesting Bitcoins will prohibit loans? Do you think it will prohibit investments in the stock market with its many financial instruments? The economy would stagnate.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:59:47
But I'm not talking about the potential price manipulation. I'm talking about the decentralization hype that would "take my money out of the crooks' hands".
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:35:04
You are hitting on the very issues that people don't want to think about, but that are very real. I've been trying to imagine a scenario where the adoption of the Bitcoin is not only feasible, but a good thing for society and it's economy, but to no avail.
People seem to think they'll be able to freeload on the government and the rich.
The case for a universal currency has also been observed by many economists before and there seem to be too many disadvantages, especially concerning fiscal and monetary policy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:37:03
Corrections are necessary when the market value of an asset gets too far from its book value. Bitcoin doesn't have a book value. "Corrections" in Bitcoin just show that there are more people willing to sell than to buy. They are called corrections by people who don't know what they're talking about. Nothing good.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:51:38
I would even disagree that it's a good store of value. You want a store of value to be predictive/stable, not volatile. The disadvantages of buying Bitcoin over gold or even real estate outweigh the advantages.
Bitcoin potential has always been as an alternative currency, but since using it as a currency has been proved ridiculous (high fees and high delays), people try to rationalize it by giving it another meaning.

A run up of 30% doesn't come close to making up for a downfall of 30%.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:11:38
I agree, but Bitcoin is not going to solve this problem. A change in government policy would, but that's beyond the scope of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:11:57
Imagine all the students who placed their student loans in Bitcoin, who will then blame the banks and the universities for their debts.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:33:35
How will Bitcoin overthrow banks though? I just don't see it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:54:46
I see what you mean, but what I'm referring to is the want to "decentralize money to get it out of the crooks' hands". These people seem to address tax as a problem, without realizing the potential problems of a state not collecting taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:54:27
You think people will keep their money parked in Bitcoin when the opportunity to get rich quick is gone? Personally, I don't see it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:24:54
The Bitcoin hype hold similarities with many phenomena. It's similar to the Tulip Mania in that the Tulip was scarce (relatively), didn't have any inherent value, and was the result of high speculation as anyone from the poor to the aristocracy rushed in with their savings. These people were not interested in the beauty or the function of the tulip, but by the big opportunity of quick cash.
You can also draw similarities to a pyramid scheme, or even to the 1998 Russian financial crisis. The majority of the participants in Bitcoin are only there because they predict someone else will be willing to come in after them. When doubt comes that buyers will not come to the same rate as seen before, people will cash out which will create a snowball effect. 
Now, as to why it is NOT the next tulip mania. The tulip mania was subject to pure speculation, with absolutely no value in the object. Bitcoin doesn't currently produce any value, but one could argue that it has potential value in it's technology as to eventually replace the current currency. Some would say that it is a store of value, but I find this idea idiotic for many reasons.

Then what's the point of adopting cryptocurrencies if you are to remove its last advantage, efficiency?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:26:16
By banks acting as intermediary I assume you mean commercial banks and Investment Banks on the sell side, like Goldman Sachs and Bear Sterns. These banks were greedy by collecting fees on the financial instruments they made, which were sold to them from commercial banks and bought from them from investors. 
The problem was mostly that commercial banks started to make too many loans. How would this issue not have arisen with Bitcoins? Will Bitcoins loans be prohibited? Will investing in the stock market, with its multitude of instruments, be denied? That would create many problems, a stagnant economy among them.

This is when the profit takers get separated from the bag hodlers.

The use of multiple currencies would defeat the purpose of an efficient universal currency. It just takes us back to square one. Maybe if you could give me some advantages of using multiple cryptocurrencies? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:56:14
The bailouts were done with our taxes. So your solution is to simply stop paying taxes?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:34:27
Which still doesn't address my concerns about the loans industry under a Bitcoin currency. How will you buy a car or a house with Bitcoins? Loans. Who will give you the loans? Anyone with the resources who think you are worthy of the risks (banks mainly). How will they asses the risks? Credit history. It all comes to the same, and Bitcoin didn't solve anything.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:16:43
You really think the FED takes the Bitcoin into account while taking important policy decisions? Really?
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:51:01
So you want to stop paying taxes completely? What about wealth redistribution? What about employment insurance? What if the U.S don't want you on it's land if you don't pay its taxes?
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:54:44
The only thing the futures mean is that the market cap of Bitcoin is big enough for the big banks to want a piece of the action (fees, probably not Bitcoins themselves). Doesn't mean it's legitimate.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:45:24
The stock price doesn't reflect the price of the company. Company X could be divided by 100 shares with the stock price of $1,000 for each share, while Company Y could be divided by 2,000 shares with the stock price of $100.
In this situation, Company X has a market capitalization of $100,000 while Company Y has a market capitalization of $200,000, making Company Y a bigger company albeit a lower stock price. You have to compare the companies by market cap, not stock price.
Although, I do agree that blockchain tech is overestimated by a large margin. Probably due to its buzzword property.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:31:59
But you can already move from a currency to another freely. The issues with this movement is the price changes between the currencies. Businesses want to reduce this volatility to effectively conduct business in a predictive way. 
Why would having multiple cryptocurrencies be any different than the current system? Because the government wouldn't control the supply?
This just gives place to a nation with no way to stimulate its economy.
Think the bailouts in 2008 were bad? Try to imagine the state of the economy without government intervention.
Bankruptcy of banks -&gt; no short-term financing nor insurance -&gt; bankruptcy of American corporations -&gt; spike of unemployment to extreme levels -&gt; shutdown of the economy.

What? No.. She said Bitcoin is a volatile asset, not a legal tender. You have to pay taxes on the gains from your assets.
All she did was stating the obvious. Bitcoin isn't currently a tender and plays a small roll in transactions, since very few companies allow Bitcoin as tender. This is mainly due to fees and delays.

There is inflation in fiat, but wouldn't there also be a devaluation in bitcoin as the GDP or the production worldwide increases?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:20:52
Thanks for answering,
Shady fucks usually are on the sell-side of the investment banks. I still don't see how having your fiat currency in a commercial bank removes any value from it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:26:18
Interesting read.

Gold does have an industrial value. It would never have been used as a currency without this preexisting value.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:54:49
Not in any way. Bitcoin has been almost purely speculative with to intrinsic value to back it up. It's like saying the crash of Beanie Babies crashed the stock market.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:00:21
You can more than offset it by investing in very low risk stocks like banks. Or you can offset it by putting your money in treasury bonds which are basically riskless. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:04:20
Why would central banks buy Bitcoins even if they were "secure"? There would be no point in it for them.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:25:52
You're talking like there's a net loss here. There's not. Except for the miners who very recently bought mining gear, the loss of one is offset by an equal win of someone else which makes it a zero sum game. If anything, people are going to put more money in the stock market instead of Bitcoin, as the opportunity to get rich quick has passed.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:29:02
You're not crazy, just stupid.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:49:19
That's idiotic. People started saying Bitcoin was a good store of value when they realized it was inefficient as a currency of exchange.
Gold not only has a stable past, but more importantly has an industrial value, which Bitcoin simply does not have.

You can't compare the fees of Bitcoin and the fees of credit cards. The fees paid to accept credit is for the risk of non-payment. If you want an appropriate comparison, compare the debit cards fees with Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin fees are higher than debit by the way.
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:03:26
You mean that the supply and demand aspect is irrelevant? That the psychological and financial barriers that Bitcoin need to overcome in order to become the currency of use are non-existent? 
The premise of Bitcoin is to become the new currency. Well perhaps it is important to understand why we even have our current currency, or how we got to the currency we have today, and what were the alternatives in the past. We could also look into the proper environment required to foster a new currency while dismissing the old one. But no, people don't want to understand, they just want to get rich quick.
