I'm new to Bitcoin, and I'm trying to figure out which exchange to use. I have seen Coinbase highly recommended in many places, but the Coinbase sub-reddit makes it seem like Coinbase is having some serious problems. Could someone maybe ELI5, Coinbase and its current problems?
EDIT: Same with Kraken. In some places I see it highly recommended. In others, people trash it.

What is a dollar bill's intrinsic value?
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:00:03
That's something convenient about USD, but is not intrinsic value of the dollar bill itself, which is just paper and ink.

Correct. But there is a limited supply of Bitcoin, so it has value by virtue of being finite (this does not mean it has *intrinsic* value, but people will argue the semantics). The Fed can **and does** print literally millions of new bills a day. They're not backed by anything. They manipulate the value to their own ends. They prosecute people that try to use anything else as currency (see Liberty Dollars [not that I support Liberty Dollars *at all*, but I don't support the way they were treated]).

I'm pretty new. What's a sell wall? What am I looking at, exactly? Does this mean there are a lot of sell orders that will happen when it hits $7000?

As someone new to Bitcoin, what do you do with the keys on a receipt? Like, how would I get it to my wallet? There are some ATMs near me so I'm curious.

Pfft I bought at 4600 and then it dipped to like 2900. Now it's at 5700. Hang in there. It always goes back up.

Is it normally instant? Like, when I click confirm, how long should it take to show up in my wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:39:37
Okay one se... *waaait a minute...*

Close your account and change banks. They have no authority over you. It's your money.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:59:44
Yes, you will. Price at time of purchase. So if it says 4000 when you click buy, you're paying 4000, regardless of what it's at when you receive it.

Thanks! This might be a stupid question, but how do I get a QR code of the address? I'm using GreenAddress. The address is just a long string of numbers and letters.
EDIT: Nevermind, it's right there. I had just never used it before.

Such as?
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:27:32
Agreed. It also illustrates what's *good* about Bitcoin. You don't see anyone saying, "Oh, damn, I bought a car for $300 in 1925! Today that $308 could get me *millions* of cars!" Because it can't. The value of a dollar has gone *down*, while the value of a Bitcoin has gone way, *way* up.
