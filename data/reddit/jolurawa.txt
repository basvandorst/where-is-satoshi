That's very detailed. Thanks

So not a good choice for what I'm looking for? Do you know of any better options?

So make sure I use 2 factor auth if I use coinbase? ��

Yeah, honestly I'm looking for a nice balance between convenient and secure. I'm not going to be investing a huge amount. I just want to buy some bitcoin and HODL without too much initial hassle or continued attention which is why i thought online would be a good option

What makes this better than other online wallets? Would it be better to buy the bitcoin on an exchange then send it to this wallet rather than just buying and holding on a service like blockchain?

I meant the one they say is second most secure. Using Google authenticator for example. Any thoughts on that?

On coinbase they have an option for a physical authenticator like you suggest but there's also the option of a software authenticator in an app on your phone. Is the software method of authentication also vulnerable to a SIM swapper? Why is a physical one better?

Unfortunately Robinhood doesn't seem available in the UK yet. Is it similar to Revolut?

That makes it sound like you know something better off the top of your head. Care to share?
