thank you very much for this video, very insightful
and buffet is not stupid, he is just probably wrong, he was right his whole life, he deserves a wrong call...

and you think they dont? see it as confusing i mean, that is the purpose
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:53:58
the problem is i sold a lot literally right before they blocked it, and now i cant buy again, and i don't want a sepa transfer, i want to buy again, i sold almost at the ATH, i want more coins before the price surges again

Poorly ran*
And i agree, sure there has to be problems we dont even know about but i think that coinbase should have the financial means of dealing with the problems

Dont jinx it! not yet, let it go up a few hundred more so 8k is secured more safely

i just bought my btc again, profits are even very nice, all turned out good 
coinbase, everybody can have a situation like this every now and again, just try to contain it in the future...

i can not for the life of me see how would an unbiased bitcoin user prefer to let a semi centralization happen because... why.. there is no logical conclusion to say no to segwit
Core is supported by every single person i have discussed this with, so where is all that "unlimited support"?

Thank you

The thing is i’m against any change in the bitcoin code, because it makes precedent to change the network later, in a maybe not so harmless way...

i use xapo, and it's listed under S2X company's, what does that mean? when/if the fork happens does that mean that i placed my funds in the S2X camp? if so i'll just pull all my coins

if complete government censorship ensues future substantial growth of bitcoins market cap, how big of a portion of small time miners do you think would be scared enough of the illegality of mining to give up such activities?
What if governments start "buying out" miners, offers substantial payment for the ASIC-s the people own (maybe even a 100% value payment so people can refund themselves) and simultaneously makes mining itself a state regulated or maybe even state operated activity? 
how many miners will choose to risk imprisonment, high fines etc. just to keep the original blockchain intact, and defy the system? rather then walk away penalty and loss free?
will the difficulty be able to drop back to GPU mining times to keep up with the amount of transactions and an EXTREME drop in hashrate to keep transactions cheap, secure and fast?
Very interested in developers opinion, do you think the code is flexible enough to handle such times of crisis?

Wirex just CLOSED this ticket!!! please people if you have advice that would solve this without involving my lawyer or any other cheaper way is welcome..

Not all silver ever mined is represented on the stock market
@_date: 2017-05-16 03:50:31
it's to 49.13%!!
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:37:52
the worst thing is this ticket closing, i feel like i'm talking to some guy on a forum selling gift cards, not what is suppose to be a big company..
if anybody has any alternative contact method or other way of reaching them please let me know..

it's down again
@_date: 2017-05-08 11:48:43
Where there is demand, supply will find a way, a new site would be up within days
@_date: 2017-05-16 01:21:48
this is fake, when you click "Switch to BTC" it shows it's actually down today, no need to report fake new like this when there is so many impressive stories that happen to be true...
there is a possibility of a massive single order, maybe one seller just did a deal of his life, do look into it /user/Coin-Dance ; it's getting interesting
@_date: 2017-05-04 13:22:52
im hoping a letter of intent to prosecute will be enough, the lawyer is a friend and is working for free, and i am pressed for cash, otherwise i would be more patient

they need you to know their name, promotion and the like, here is not the case
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:34:21
Back up!
@_date: 2017-05-08 13:10:04
This made my day! the guy just scored 100 points with me :)

better call morty
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:26:22
enjoy them

no, that is not unusual, if you owned a multi million dollar (billion soon) company you wouldn't want your name known if it's not necessary for your products, the thing worrying me is that they don't seem interested in proving us wrong that they are causing/allowing the ddos attacks right after/during the coin dumps by whales

just add bit infront of whatever idea you have for a normal hedge fund
