Correct. You can't bait them and then shoot them.

I mean, am I doing something wrong?

The early days of Siri could help with that.

Even as of over a week ago?

I reset my password, updated my phone number, and am on the ID verification stage but there is nowhere to continue with the process. No upload button, no instructions, no links, nada.  
Is this what they're referring to when they say "ID verification is currently degraded for some customers" ?
Edit: was on hold for 107 minutes this morning. They simply don't even know how to fix the problem. They admitted to not knowing what's going on or how to fix it and that "there's nothing we can do" to fix it. 
I call B.S. 
They then emailed me a list of four reasons why it may not work, and none of them recognized the root issue. There is no upload button, no start button, no step list, nada.

I mean, I know exactly where you're coming from and I also abide by the 12&gt;6 rule. I'm just saying, it would be a VERY shitty time in court. In my training they specifically talk about instances like that.

It's like an accord V6 coupe, but not as cool.

Does anyone know why the ID Verification on coinbase doesn't work? I can't even begin the process. There's no options for beginning the process. I've seen photos that redditors have posted of the process and every time I try to do it, it's blank. 
I can't log in whatsoever. Not on the app, not on mobile browser, and not on desktop.

I just moved to Tucson. I haven’t seen anything about BTC anywhere. Looks like my dreams of paying in BTC are not going to happen soon here. You know, with the entire populace being Medicare qualifying age and having all of their holdings in USD.
