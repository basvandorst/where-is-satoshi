People say mainstream adoption but do you think banks will adopt btc? Why would they pay for a technology, when they could just start their own crypto currency based on what has been developed? Leaving btc in the dust.
Banks don't pay for shit. They control everything. 
Let's call it bank coin. $1 = 1 coin. Now we have everyone.using our bank coin. 
Not $1 = 0.00016474 btc.

Thanks for that- the reason I posted is for insight. 
I do have to admit that perhaps the 'fud' has got to me. But it's hard when it is all I see. 
 Either way, I still don't see the banks allowing a monetary revolution- hence investing and controlling. But perhaps that is just fud, as you say. 
Though what I see happening is it getting to a point where the banks say enough is enough. The banks then paying the government a big ol lot of cash (this shit happens all the time) and the government tightening (to the point of attrition). Essentially making crypto invaluable. Sure you can argue that it may still then work in a 'black market kinda way' but then what value will it really hold in society? 
I'll be sure to check out Andreas videos.

I suppose it's more like FIAT with a digital edge. A digital edge developed in the crypto world. 
Fiat is tender that the government has made legal. Which then gains value from supply and demand in a regulated fashion (tax etc). 
Again, crypto currencies in society  aint viable in a black market sense without these regulations. I don't see the government's allowing that. Not when the banks are filling their wallet with money. 
So yes, crypto will need to become fiat in a sense. Which leads to my above point. 
I should probably stop playing the devil's advocate here. In truth, I do want crypto to rise so I make a pretty fiat.
