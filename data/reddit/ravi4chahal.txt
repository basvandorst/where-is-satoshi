Suppose Electrum wallet has multiple addresses say a1,d2,a3. And user wants to send it to trezor address T1. Can he send from multiple addresses to a single address in one transaction? If yes, please guide.

I would suggest invest 2-5 percent of your overall portfolio in one go. And then just HoDl. This would keep risk to a minimum at the same time giving exposure the crypto currency.

A trustable standard of measuring value will take away power from the cons and oligarchs who make riches off poor by printing and manipulation of money. Hyperbitcoinization will give power to a mom and pop shop owner to compete with Amazons of the world.
