I just read and Posted an article about this on one of my other "Social networks" and it seem there are Some programs out there that you might have luck with in cracking their "Btc locker" hack, just do a bit more research and I'm sure you will find an answer... aside from that TRY A Different Seller on Localbitcoins that doesn't require I.D. ... I have a Account on there but not listed to sell.. I have BTC if your in SoCal... is Absolutely right too both Do Backups next time and In person Deals Are Best! 
Don't Give those Hacker Chumps Anything if you don't have too... Either way Good Luck

Most sellers on localbitcoins require you send the cash as "Friends and Family " so you can Not request a "refund" during the transaction period. Be careful in doing so as I've been burned in the past with bad sellers.. If you make sure the Ad is "Online Buy" ad you can have the BTC put in Escrow
