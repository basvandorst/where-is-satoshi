Isn't that just a matter of semantics? Does it matter if a prediction market that functions similar to an exchange calls themselves an exchange, as long as they are transparent about their operations (i.e. no delivery of specie). People who actually want to exchange specie would not be on an "exchange" that does not provide actual delivery. Only people who want to bet would be on such a site. If you are speculating or day trading, then you are betting.
A Wall Street exchange had an order book of 2b BTC could easily become insolvent, and I would stay away if I couldn't get instant delivery of actual BTC. But if people want to speculate and place 2b btc worth of bets, it doesn't affect those of us who are actually using btc in our daily transactions. If they were labeled as a Wall Street prediction market instead of an exchange, would that change anything?

"Naked short selling is basically fraud and counterfeiting. . .
. . .They are betting sites, little more Wall Street run casinos"
There is nothing fraudulent or counterfeiting about running a betting organization. If they are open about allowing naked shorts and not delivering specie (i.e. actual bitcoin), then there is nothing fraudulent about it. A betting or prediction market can actually be a very useful thing, while you are not getting an actual price for the asset, the price of betting tends to mirror and/or predict the price.

Is there any record of transactions that are broadcast, but not included in the blockchain? If the coins were all stolen through utilizing transaction malleability, there would have been two nearly simultaneous transactions published with the same inputs and outputs. Is there a way to look for transaction pairs that meet this description? One would have made it into the blockchain, but would their be any record of the voided original transaction?
Alternatively, if there is no record of voided transactions, there should be a replicate transaction to the same address for the same amount in the following days after the recipient reported they had never received the funds and Gox would resend a new transaction. This analysis would also find completely legitimate transactions, but might give us a good idea of whether the 744,000 number is reasonable for an amount lost through transaction malleability.

Some smart property protocols use other blockchains (e.g. etherium), some use Satoshis or fractions of bitcoins on the main blockchain (e.g. colored coins). If the protocol uses another blockchain it will have zero direct effect on demand/price, if the protocol uses very small fractions of bitcoins, it will have almost zero direct effect on demand/price. 
However, I think there probably will be indirect effects on price. The use of other blockchain applications will likely help to push bitcoin itself to be more mainstream. Likely the easiest way to buy smart assets will be with bitcoins.

Think of it as the alt coin being backed by bitcoin, in much the same way that the US dollar used to be backed by gold (although it's not a perfect comparison). I can turn in X bitcoin to the alt-coin chain to receive X alt-coins (similar to proof-of-burn), but unlike proof-of-burn, the bitcoin is not destroyed it is somehow held ransom in a digital "vault". When I want to redeem my alt-coins for bitcoin, I can pay them to the "vault". This destroys the alt-coins  and my bitcoin will be released to me.

A web wallet is the best option in a number of situations. One being the case where you want to sell coins. They need to be on an exchange's account, which is effectively a web wallet. (There are potentially methods to do this where the exchange doesn't have access to the coins, but AFAIK no exchanges use these methods yet.) If you want to sell coins on an exchange, a web wallet is the only option.
Another case is when you want to have access to your coins on multiple platforms. I buy things online via my PC, but I also exchange coins in person, via my android device, so I like to have access to some coins on either platform. You need your wallet online to do that. If you are using a web wallet that uses strong encryption that is carried out on the user's side (e.g. blockchain), there is very little added security risk.

One problem with physical bitcoins is the introduction of 3rd party risk. If the mint retains the private keys printed on the coins, and is malicious, all the coins could be drained to the mint's account at a future date.

As far as wallets go I think blockchain.info is a good choice for novices and for people who value convenience. 
When choosing a bitcoin wallet there is a trade-off between security and convenience. Generally the more control you maintain, the safer you are from outside hacks and incompetence of others. While giving up some control generally tends to make it safer from your own mistakes, and more convenient to use/spend your bitcoins. Some of the most popular wallet software available, ranked from most secure to most convenient are: A physical paper wallet printed using Armory or safe paper wallet; Armory; Bitcoin-QT; Electrum; blockchain.info; coinbase.com
Your needs will help you decide which wallet software to use. For example, if you plan on saving large sums of bitcoin as a long term investment, you will want to use something very secure like a paper wallet or Armory, if you plan on spending your bitcoin at different locations using a smartphone and computer, a web wallet like blockchain.info or coinbase.com may be best.

It doesn't really look like it's just lack of transactions.

BTC hashrate hasn't dropped noticeably (yet). Over the last 14 hours, (since the fork) BTC has mined 97 blocks, or a block every 8-9 minutes. But it's a really small sample. The Bitcoin hashrate varies +/- 30% in any given day.
@_date: 2017-08-02 01:28:33
It looks like viaBTC has mined 3 of the 10 BCC blocks. They have about 7% of all of bitcoin's hashing power and would be expected to have found about 3 blocks in the last 6.5 hours since the fork (0.07 x 6 blocks/hour x 6.5 hours). Which is what we see from viaBTC. That means some unknown pool that has ~15% of the global hash rate has been turned on to the BCC chain. Looking at the [Coinbase text]( from the other blocks, you can see they all have the same format, and all include the address of the Kwong Wah Building in Hong Kong, which is a pretty nondescript apartment building with a couple storefronts on the ground level. This suggests that someone has turned on ~900 PH of miners in the Kwong Wah Building.

There are no excess coins. There was only an excess when MtGox was in bankruptcy due to the way claims were valued. Now, under Civil Rehabilitation, claims are valued in BTC, and there is no excess, there is only 15-20% of what would be required to make the creditors whole.
@_date: 2019-02-26 16:17:10
No, there are no bankruptcy payments anymore. MtGox is now under civil rehabilitation, which replaced the bankruptcy process. No bankruptcy settlement payments have been made and none will ever be made (as long as we stay in civil rehabilitation). 
Saying that there are or will be bankruptcy payments is what leads to the confusion in the OP. If there were bankruptcy payments then the creditors claims would be legally satisfied and creditors would have no basis to make a claim on the "remaining" coins. We fought hard to make sure that there were no and will never be any bankruptcy payments.
@_date: 2019-02-26 16:26:35
It was a bit murky. Their TOS claimed that they did not own creditors coins, that they still belonged to the creditors. But the way they were managed demonstrated otherwise. Since they didn't maintain segregated accounts or even full reserves, there was no way to legally recognize the coins as belonging to the creditors. Instead, the creditors have claims on the MtGox estate, and the MtGox estate has a number of assets (BTC, bank account funds, IP, domain name, etc.).  The question is whether those assets are sufficient to repay all of the creditor claims. 
Under bankruptcy: Yes, with half a billion USD left over assets for the shareholders. 
Under Civil Rehabilitation: No, there are only enough to repay the creditors \~20% of what is owed and nothing left for the shareholders.
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:54:35
"isn't creditors' claim fully satisfied already?"
If the conversion of claims from BTC to JPY was maintained, then yes, legally the repayment in fiat would fully satisfy the claims. This was the case under bankruptcy. This would not be a fair outcome because:
1. The creditors never asked for their claims to be valued in JPY.
2. This would result in a huge "surplus" paid to the shareholders of Mt.Gox, which in effect would financially reward their inability to protect their customers funds.
Moving back to civil rehabilitation gives the trustee the flexibility to revalue claims back to what they originally were: BTC claims. So the current claims (in BTC) will probably be paid back \~20% in a mix of BTC and fiat but will be valued at current exchange rates for BTC (not 2014 rates).  The trustee probably sold the chunk of coins to lock in some gains which guarantees the legal requirement that creditors should not be worse off under civil rehabilitation than they were under bankruptcy.

I don't get how he could buy back at the lower price and make a profit. It's easy enough to drive the price down with a big short sale, but are other people just panic selling at the lower price? Who else is selling as soon as the price drops a bunch? That seems like a bad strategy, to sell the dips and buy the peaks?

Partially, but one of the essential attributes of (good) money is that it is durable. That's because money also serves as a store of value. There are many good reasons to store money instead of spending it immediately. The primary one is a "hedge" against uncertainty. For example, I don't know when my car might need a new transmission so I keep a $1000 on hand. I don't know when I might lose my job, so it's a good idea to have some savings. It might be prudent to invest most of this savings, but you don't know when the market might crash. You may even prefer cash money to checking account money due to uncertainty about the safety of your money in the banks (e.g. Cyprus). 
Holding reliable, durable, stable money lets you mitigate these risks.

This seems to be a credit union, so there is no "profit", the full "X" gets returned to the depositors (less defaults, and expenses). Alternately, you could say that the depositors are also the owners, so the same people get "Y" as depositors, and "X-Y" as the owners (less defaults, and expenses).
The bigger question I have is who in there right mind would borrow bitcoin at interest? I can see someone borrowing at low interest rates when there is slight deflation (e.g. borrow at 1% "nominal interest rate", plus 2% deflation = total 3% "real interest rate"), but borrowing when it is very possible, if not likely that over the next few months the value of bitcoins will double? The borrower would end up paying a real interest rate of &gt;100%. 
It might make sense if someone is borrowing to sell on the market because they believe the value will decline, and they will be able to buy back at a lower price (i.e. short the market). But this is the only reason I could imagine someone borrowing BTC at interest.

You can only have the coins locally or on a online wallet service, not both. If they are with some online wallet service, you liable to the honesty and reliability of the service. If you have them in a wallet on your computer (which you can, and should, back up in other locations) you are liable to your own HDD failure (not a problem if you backed up) or theft if someone has access to your computer and you don't have your wallet file encrypted. 
Both methods have their distinct risks. Having a local wallet can be more safe if you go to the trouble to make it so, but remote wallet service is probably safer if you are not willing to put the work into protecting a local wallet. Personally, I split my coins between both.

If a single pool has &gt;50% of the hashing power, it is possible for the pool operator to do some nefarious stuff with the bitcoin network. Things like double spending, and preventing certain transactions from being processed.

This couldn't quite work. To be able to buy your own coins at a price higher than the market price, you would have to buy up every cheaper offer first. 
For example, assume the market price is $18, and there are people offering 10,000 bitcoins at prices ranging from 18.01 to 29.99. To be able to buy your own (or anyone else's) bitcoins at a price of $30 on MtGox, you would need to buy every one of the offers between 18.01 and 29.99. MtGox, like most organized market places, prioritizes the lowest offers, and highest bids when matching new offers and bids. Of course someone could "sell" a bunch of bitcoins at $30, or what ever price they want, to themselves or a friend through means other than MtGox, but this wouldn't affect the MtGox price.

I believe that each miner (or manager of a mining pool) will be able to set a minimum fee required to include transactions in any blocks they solve. Some miners might set their minimum fee to 0, others might set a relatively high fee. 
People sending transactions can put what ever fee they want on their transactions. If they don't include a fee (or the fee is too low), the transaction will not be included in a block (i.e. confirmed) until a miner who has no minimum solves a block. If the person sending the transaction includes a higher fee, then their transaction will be included in any block solved by any of the miners. Thus including a fee guarantee a fast processing time.

We need more (good) speculators on the market. Good speculators even out the prices on a market, and would get rid of these crazy +50% price change per day. 
A successful speculator buys low and sells high. Buying drives up the price, and selling drives down the price, thus making the lows less low and the highs less high.
Of course when speculators make mistakes (or a "cluster of errors") they create bubbles, and end up loosing their own money, but in the process, create huge swings in the market which makes life hard for anyone trying to actually use bitcoins for actual commerce, and plan ahead for pricing and expenses.

@_date: 2011-06-07 22:24:20


No this is not right. 
A person sending a transaction can attach any fee they wish. If you turn on a fee, .01 is the default in the standard bitcoin software, but this is not a fixed number. The vast majority of transactions contain no fee. Right now, there is probably no advantage to including a fee, so the only fees are from people who either are feeling generous to the miners for supporting the bitcoin network, or don't know what they are doing. Right now, the average block contains [43 transactions]( At least in my pool, the average fees collected per block is &lt;.09 BTC, this means that only 1 out of 5 transactions includes a fee (assuming all fees are .01, which may not be the case).
A miner can choose to required any fee they wish. However, this does not mean that a person sending a transaction needs to include a fee. If, eventually, miners start requiring a fee, then your transactions may take longer to go through without a fee, but it will always go through eventually. (Right now, miners make way more from newly mined coins, so there is no benefit to charging a fee.) If you don't include a fee, your transaction will not be included in blocks solved by miners who require a fee, but eventually your transaction will be included in a block by a miner who does not require a fee. When bitcoins are "mined out", as you say, I think fees will tend to be rather low, but it will be on a sliding scale. If I am in a hurry for my transaction to go through, I may include a $.20 equivalent fee or more, but if I'm in no hurry, and don't care if it takes a week to go through, I may include a $.001 equivalent fee, or no fee. In the future, when there are more transactions per block (assuming bitcoin becomes more widespread) it will likely be even easier for miners to make money with very small transaction fees.

I believe that Kevin bought about half of the coins (~260,000 of ~500,000) the rest were sold at prices above .0101, but lower than "true market value". I'm not sure how much of the remaining 240,00 BTC filled standing orders or how much was snapped up by other quick clickers. Either way, I'm sure some of those other buyers pulled their money out in the time between the flash crash and the time the market was halted. If one of my low ball standing orders got filled, and the market was acting very strange, I would have pulled my money out ASAP!
Kevin pulled out the "maximum" $1000 dollar equivalent once the price started to recover. Depending on when the other buyers made withdraws, the price may have been higher or lower, and thus they may have been able to withdraw more or less than Kevin.

I think the most likely way taxes on BTC transactions will play out as the bitcoin economy grows is that individuals will not pay any taxes (just as most people who buy/sell on ebay or craigslist for USD don't pay taxes), but larger more established businesses will charge sales tax for sales, pay income taxes on profits, and withhold personal income taxes for employees (if it ever get's to the point where employees are being paid in BTC).

Perhaps having a different colored background (maybe black) would help small transactions stand out better. 
It would also be neat to combine this price graph with a market depth graph. Your graph is great for seeing the history of what has happened, and a graph like [MtGoxLive]( is better at trying to predict what will happen (because they have the market depth). If you could combine your heatmap with a market depth it would be a really neat way to display a lot of information in an understandable way.

If either the hacker actually got away with significant BTC, or if MtGox can't "roll back" all the purchases because people were able to withdraw their BTC, then MtGox will have fewer reserves than are reported in people's accounts, and thus be a *de facto* fractional reserve bank--which is what people are worried about.

He is not talking about MtGox, he is talking about P2P bitcoin transactions. If you turn on a fee in the bitcoin client, the default fee is .01/transaction, but there is no reason to include any fee today.
@_date: 2011-06-07 23:17:05
AFAIK it will help your transaction through faster once some miners require a fee, but no miners require a fee right now, so there is nothing to gain. If half the miners require a .01 fee, and the others don't, then by including the .01 fee, on average, your transaction will take half as long to get processed. There is chance involved, if the next block is solved by a miner who requires a fee, then your transaction will not be included in the block, and you have to wait until a miner who doesn't require a fee to solve a block.

The debate over the honesty of fractional reserve banking has been going on for hundreds of years, and frankly it's irrelevant. 
The question is whether fractional reserve banking *could* be done. 
Aahzmundus and others are right that there is no technical reason why fractional reserve banking couldn't work with bitcoin, however on a practical level the question is still open for debate. There is no central organization backing up bitcoin and bitcoin banks like the Federal Reserve and the FDIC back up the dollar and dollar banks. Not having a FDIC to back up fractional bitcoin deposits would make bitcoin fractional reserve banking much riskier than dollar fractional reserve banking. So it is very possible that people defaulting on bitcoin loans, and/or the risk of a run on the bitcoin bank could make fractional reserve banking impossible on a practical level (i.e. unprofitable) My personal prediction is that fractional reserve banking could work to a limited extent, where the "fraction" is maybe closer to 1/2 compared with the dollar bank number of 1/10.

The price at which individuals obtain coins does affect how evenly spread bitcoins are.

Bitcoin could either be used to directly transfer bitcoins to people in Somalia, or, in the more likely case that they want SOS, not BTC, bitcoin could be used just to bypass the role played by US banks currently. 
There are fairly easy ways to trade USD for BTC, then BTC could be transferred to the Hawala system, which could transfer SOS to the final party. Hawala already has the SOS, the only difficulty is to get the hawala network to accept BTC.

I assume you want this card for bitcoin mining since you posted in r/bitcoin.
If your machine has the correct plug for the video card, then it should work fine. You just need to check whether your mother board has a PCIe x16 slot, and you will be in good shape. (You can use slower PCIe slots, but will need to bit of physical modification to make the plug fit.) Having a slow processor, or not very much RAM shouldn't have any significant effect on your ability to mine.
Couple other probably-not-important-things to keep in mind: 
Dual GPU cards (e.g. ATI 6990) are big, make sure they will fit in your case if you are looking at these.
Make sure your power supply has enough extra power to run your card.

The prices are the prices that people have actually made trades at on MtGox.com
So it is much like the price of an individual stock on the stock market. (less like a stock index like the Dow Jones Industrial Average--which is the number most commonly used as "the stock market"-- the DJIA is a weighted average of a bunch of stocks prices, and not an actual price itself)
When the price goes from 19.90 to 19.83, that means the last transaction on MtGox (excluding darkpool transactions) was one person trading some number of bitcoins to another at the price of 19.83.
The listed price is not so much a calculation, as a history of recent trades.

We already went over this, besides a few exceptions, bitcoin fee is zero. 
If you can get cashier's checks for free, you are doing better than I am (I've always had to pay a buck or so). But even then your transaction is slower, less secure, and less anonymous than bitcoin.


They have higher priority when a fee is included, but there is no way for a miner to prevent your transaction from eventually going through even with out a fee.
You are right about MtGox being a current weakness of the bitcoin economy. If MtGox got shut down or hacked it would be a setback for bitcoin, but I'm confident it would recover. If something happened to MtGox, overnight, the other exchanges would matter a lot. I love what MtGox has done, but I would like to see other exchanges gain popularity to give some much needed competition to MtGox.

What are you comparing bitcoins to? Compared to any other type of digital money transfer (Western Union, bank wire, Visa, etc) the control of the network and fees is incredibly distributed with bitcoin. Instead of one single centrally controlled entity overseeing, regulating, and charging for transactions, bitcoin has thousands of people. It's completely decentralized and direct, relative to every other monetary system, with the exception of using actual precious metal coins. And if you thin the miners have too much power, then join them, you too can become a fairly powerful miner without anyone's permission for an investment only in the thousands.


Some may, but it is impossible for miners to put mandatory high fees on all transactions. Unless all of the thousands of miners demand fees, without exception, transactions without the high fees will always go through.


You do need to put quite a bit of trust in MtGox if you are going to use that service, but MtGox != bitcoin. MtGox is just one exchange, there are others (although none nearly as popular). Having a good exchange like MtGox is a great help to the bitcoin comunity, but bitcoin does not need MtGox.
I read up a bit more about [transaction fees]( The explanation I gave above was a bit simplified. The default software today doesn't require a fee for sending most transactions, but there are some exceptions that I didn't realized, notably very small transactions (to prevent DoS attacks on the network), and transactions with a lot of data (because it is more work for the miners).

You are right, but in the long run it should work out, as bad day traders loose all their money and have less effect on the price, and good day traders get more money and have more effect on the price.

Unfortunately, using just the SI prefix will make things more confusing, as you could be referring to mL or mg or mm. Most of the time context would make it clear, but not always. 
That said, working in a science lab, I do often refer to units by just their SI prefix: mills=mL; mikes=µL; migs=mg; kilo=kg. So it can work, but it would be nice to have some terms that were not ambiguous.

Is there anything to prevent you from sending the change back to the paper wallet address? 
 I know it is not the default action of the software, but say you import your address with 5 BTC and spend your 1 BTC, bitcoin-qt or whatever will show you with a 4BTC balance, but it is actually in a new "change" address, correct? Could you then do another transaction where you send 4 BTC to the paper address? The software will show no change in balance, but the coins should be back on the paper wallet, right? Or am I missing something?

I was wondering about this, and don't know how a Sybil attack works. Does it cost much resources to make all these false nodes (time/bandwidth/computing power)? If it takes a bunch of resources it seems like it would negate the small advantage that a pool could get.
