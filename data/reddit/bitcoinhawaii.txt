Good stuff.
While most of the Bitcoin development chatter happens on https//bitcointalk.org, I don't like that interface much and very much welcome any development talk on myself.  Unfortunately, it looks like is a ghost town.  Maybe this can change?
Even though it may rehash parts of other pages, another document of the Blockchain raw format is most definitely useful because it pulls it all together.
This post has me reading the rest of your blog and I'm very excited to find all of the clean blockchain and address computation C++ code you've already published.  I very much like the fact that your code doesn't bring in thirdparty dependencies, especially on libs like OpenSSL and Boost.
Please, continue publishing Bitcoin documentation and code.  Seeing respected veteran programmers, such as yourself, give so much effort into Bitcoin dev give me great confidence in the future of Bitcoin.
It's not much but [here's 10mBTC]( for your efforts.

From the page: *"Mt. Gox is struggling to keep up."* -- sounds like another exchange...

I'd bet that you're technically *not* a Hawaii resident. Rules on residency requirements vary by statem, but you're likely a resident of wherever you live.

Don't forget [The Blockchain Bash]( 3 days later celebrating Bitcoin's 5th birthday.

I would love for *The Blockchain Bash* every Jan 3rd to become a 'thing'.


The other date to celebrate would be [Oct 31st, 2009, the date the original white paper was published by Satoshi](  In fact, the [Tel Aviv Meetup already celebrated that 5th anniversary]( with a party.
I like to think of The Genesis Block as the actual 'birth' of Bitcoin, as it is the spawn data upon which all else is derived from.
Either way, they're both good reasons to celebrate Bitcoin.
I encourage other Bitcoin groups world-wide to join the celebration.

Ho brah, dats a party rite dere! Why no you make it happen?
Seriuosly, I'd love to see the Blockhain Bash idea spread.
We will have a keg but I would be happy to send a six-pack or 3 of Primo, Bikini Blonde, or Longboard to make it happen and extend the aloha to the BI.

McKay from the O`ahu Hawaii meetup here.  Email sent.  Hopefully shipping to Hawaii isn't too bad (a lot of times it is).

We will have enough space.  The current room we going to use can hold 60 and in the unlikely event more show up we could accommodate at least another 100.
