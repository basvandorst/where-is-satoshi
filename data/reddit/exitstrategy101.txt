If that happened I would consider I still 'won'.  To this point I have cashed out around $170k USD. My total investment was around $38k USD. $132k gain in 5 years is respectable. If BTC carshed to zero from here I'd revert to what I have known best, HODL'ing. I would still consider myself honored to have been a part of this ride and reaped some reward.

no.  take a closer look at my post.
If I did not exit with this strategy and held until $40k and only then sold 80% of my stack, 80% of 125BTC when BTC = $40k is $4m.
With my exit strategy executed I would have pulled a total sum of $3.3M.
Remember, I'm not cashing out 100%.  I'm leaving 20% to HODL.

There are a few exchanges that I use.  It's quite easy.  The withdrawal limits can be a pain in the ass though.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:10:47
I'd be very happy with my $170k cashed out thus far with only $38k in.

My CPA did the same. Says this is how he does jt and if the IRS requests a detailed listing of trades he then sends it.

Shitty due diligence in that deal.

That’s not a Casascius physical Bitcoin. It’s a cheap copper novelty coin that can be bought on Amazon for about $10. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 21:51:33
There’s no way to prove the public address externally of the coin is not fake and there is a bogus key on the inside.  Buying physical coins is risky. 
@_date: 2019-03-24 04:53:58
Correction... $5

One need only look to the definition of vanity.

Difficulty adjustments are not dependent on number of miners, rather how quickly blocks clear. You can have the same number of or even less people mining and still see a difficulty increase.

Not quite. Don’t confuse password strength with entropy. 
A human chosen password of 10 characters such as the word Washington has roughly the same entropy as this 10 character random generated password of Ha30*wKdjL.  About 3 bits. 
Both have similar entropy but one is much stronger than the other. 
A password can be high entropy but still weak.
@_date: 2019-06-03 05:45:15
With what password?

No specific news event. Just Bitcoin being Bitcoin. Once a move started it began to liquidate shorts which cascaded into a massive BGD.

If you are running a mining operation as a business then, yes most likely.  But how about consult a CPA ?

The value is you don't have to source and cut the titanium plates yourself.  Also the two plate pack and screws with the tamper decals is pretty cool.
I think many people would rather buy a product like this than do the legwork to get all the components separately.
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:50:33
if you've got a hardware wallet (a pre-requisite of sorts with this type of product), you've already exposed your name and address.

Until one day when you may experience a brain injury and all your crypto is lost forever because you lost the ability to remember your seed.  Using your memory is just plain stupid.

Do not expose your seed words to any digital device.  Even if obfuscated. 
Titanium seed plates by ColdTi are the best!

No, if you call $500k BTC this year and it exceeds it you’d be right. 
You got it backwards.
