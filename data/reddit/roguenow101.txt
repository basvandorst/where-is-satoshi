I have read the quote and the context. Satoshi laid out a clear method for hard forks. There is nothing scary about them.

This is a blatant lie. Miners are *part* of the community. They, by your own criteria, have a say in hardforks.

It is a technical argument, but it is an inevitable aspect of Bitcoin's blockchain, and, therefore, a very poor argument. Satoshi said there would come a time when running full nodes would be relegated to server farms.


It's called Bitcoin Cash... this attempt at re-naming is just sad from your side.

No one ever wanted a hard fork to be rushed. The scaling issue has been around for years and a HF could have been implemented exactly the way Satoshi said it should have been. Instead, the core devs stalled and stalled. A HF to lift the block size the way Satoshi instructed would not have been rushed or "dangerous" like some of the devs claim with zero evidence.

google authenticator is compromised if the computer was compromised at the time the token is given, or, clearly, if the token is stored on a compromised computer.

All of your "technical" arguments amount to you not wanting bitcoin as it was designed. Refusing to scale on chain is a huge departure from Bitcoin as it is supposed to be. If all the L2 solutions are as great as you think, they should have no problem competing with on chain scaling solutions.

What the hell does peoples ability to mine have to do with the necessity of mining? For PoW to work there needs to be work. It's pretty simple.

Only without miner support a UASF doesn't work unless you have near complete support from users. USAF doesn't have anywhere near what is needed for it to be successful. Everyone running a UASF node is just cutting himself off from the network and refusing to accept what will be valid blocks to everyone else. I guess you'll all see come August 1st. This is a massively stupid move. Core should have just merged a blocksize increase ages ago. They are the ones who have been stalling. People like Luke-Jr claiming full nodes shouldn't need broadband internet and spreading FUD are the problem.

UASF will fail.

No real support. Switching a few nodes doesn't matter without any hashrate. Go read the whitepaper and stop listening to Luke-Jr. Miners do matter. You guys can claim a contentious fork is difficult and dangerous when it even has a super-majority of the hashpower and user support. Fine. There is some truth to that. However a contentious fork with no hashpower and a minority of user support isn't even dangerous. It's just pointless. There is virtually no chance of UASF being successful. If you want segwit with no base blocksize increase, you will have to fork-off your minority hash rate into an altcoin.

Ruin bitcoin by wanting on-chain scaling, the way it was meant to scale? I wager you haven't even read the whitepaper.

I want bitcoin to scale both on-chain and off-chain. I am deeply suspicious of the people who refuse to acknowledge that the 1MB limit was always supposed to be temporary or that the tech doesn't support larger blocks. Bitcoin can't be only a settlement layer, and LN has quite a few issues that make it less than ideal. Larger blocks have to happen for bitcoin to continue to be the primary crypto. I have no problem with other solutions but they must compete with bitcoin as it was meant to be. BTW, Satoshi foresaw large mining cartels. He foresaw this because it is *impossible* to prevent. The only way to prevent it would be by making bitcoin worthless.

On chain scaling works on *general purpose* broadband connections. Most of us have connections that can handle larger blocks. Sure some people, like LukeJr, don't have broadband, but that is no reason to prevent scaling. I'm all for second layer solutions, but not at the cost of on chain scaling. 1MB is a joke. Before, you talked about "where bitcoin came from". Satoshi himself said that eventually it would get to the point where most (not all) miners and nodes would be large server farms. This was expected.

Like you? I can't wait for August 1st so you will all see how moronic the UASF is.

Riiiight.... He understood that markets tend toward some level centralization. This is a simple fact and it cannot be prevented. With Bitcoin *over*centralization works against the miners' self-interest if it starts to affect the safety of Bitcoin. An equilibrium will always be found. He believed in market solutions. Small-blockers are trying to force the market to behave how they would like. They will fail.
