Just logged back in on this account so sorry for the late reply. 
Spartans Hold, and Too the Moon! memes absolutely did help Bitcoin get to where it is today.
During the 2012 / 2013 rallies it helped build a buzz and community spirit here in r/bitcoin which is now a very popular sub. 
Lost of times it helped stopped me panic selling, knowing that I wasn't the only crazy motherfucker buying what appeared to be a ridiculous ponzi scheme. 
That's not to take anything away from the serious contributors of code etc. who also made this project work. It takes more than that though.

That's at least half as big!

But everything else has failed. It's time to go Leeroy Jenkins up in this bitch

Agreed, 6 months in crypto might as well be 6 years. 
We have enemies at the gate... We can't just sit on our hands and hope something happens.

Relax, I'm playing. Thanks for the contributions. 
The community with all of its talk of moon landings and Spartans helped us to get where we are today. 
The same can be seen in the approaching competition...I browse r/ethereum for nostalgia!
 
Thanks to your efforts (and those of other coders) this project is very strong, but we are under threat of losing our position... Within months quite possibly! 
It's not very vocal, but lots of bitcoiners are switching to other coins.
How do we make progress sitting on the sidelines hoping someone else does something?

I think most of us know what Segwit is, we're not just doing something because someone wrote  
It's basically the only way we survive at this point. 
On the other side of fear is greatness.
