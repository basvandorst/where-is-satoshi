It's cut off, but it looks like he talks more about it to the right.

Gentlemen: I give you Reddit.
@_date: 2014-02-14 06:39:39
The improper grammar somehow makes this post better.

It's the Chinese variant.

Still haven't had a problem here!
Just goes to show that for every bad story, there's a hundred good ones that have been completely overshadowed.

Guys.. Take it easy on him. Everyone's got to learn. :)
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:41:18
Well, they're both blue.
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:00:16
It's also annoying as heck. Please stop.
@_date: 2014-09-11 05:06:47
Well, yeah, but how many people do you know who actually have that set up properly?
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:15:27
You can also go into the inspector and delete the html that's blocking you. :)
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:51:09
Wow, a *whole $20?*
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:27:06
This isn't a trollbox.

Contains charts. Must be elite trader. 10/10 setup.

You can reset pretty much any account if you have someone's email account.

It ended up working after six hours or so. Don't know what was up with that. :P
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:55:49
Dude, your username is "isthismyaccount2" and you've been on reddit for 22 days. Are you stupid or something? Or am I even more stupid for even asking?
@_date: 2014-03-23 03:33:31
I think it might be a joke.

I thought you were saying that BTC was the name for time zone +8. We should make that a thing...
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:09:22
Not quite.
@_date: 2014-04-22 20:04:27
That was awesome. Makes me glad I donated some BTC, even if it was just a little bit. Dorian seems like a really cool guy, and I love the fact that all of this has made him a bitcoin user!
@_date: 2014-04-15 16:47:49
Looks like we broke it. Not getting any emails from them, haha.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:30:39
How were you able to upload it? I've not been able to upload a file via their website thus far.
@_date: 2015-07-12 22:29:26
On a positive note, look at all the randomly generated passcodes! This is an excellent reason to use them.

I bought! *salutes* 
@_date: 2013-12-09 07:26:52
You made me smile, have some gold! :)
@_date: 2013-12-22 03:24:22
So... Twitter bootstrap.
@_date: 2013-12-22 03:45:02
Happy cake day.

Sounds awesome! Feel free to shoot me a message if you ever need anything. I'm always glad help a fellow Bitcoiner. If that's a word.
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:17:08
Have some gold that I bought with BTC! :D

Hey, I'm a freelance web designer. [Obligatory proof.](
What you've got here is good, in a sense of letting people know exactly what you do in a very short time frame. This is something a lot of websites lack, however it is one of the most important aspects of a website, in my opinion.
Even though the visual elements of your website are not by any means "top notch", they work just fine for you, so I wouldn't worry too much about that. Bad aesthetics are really only a problem if they get "in the way" of whatever you're trying to convey. (An example would be a design affecting legibility.)
One thing you should consider, however, is adding a page about Bitcoin. What is it? How do people get Bitcoins, so they can pay you? Why can't they just use something like, say, Paypal? And are you strict, or do you accept other payment methods? These are questions your potential customers will probably be asking. Whenever you step out of the conventional, you need to guide people as clearly as possible, or else you'll lose them somewhere along the way.
I wish you the best of luck, and hope I've helped at least a little bit!
