+1.  If you must gamble, at least play a game where you can win long term, like poker.  
It also helps you keep your mental math sharp and stimulates your mind as you get older.

Good point.  What is a 0day flaw? If I keep my bitcoins in cold storage with a computer that does not touch the internet.  Other than viruses hitching a ride on a USB stick, are there any vulnerabilities?

If the US government / German government / any government of major world economies declared the purchase, holding, and use of bitcoin illegal, then it would definitely be a major blow to the bitcoin community.  Do you disagree?

"Relatively" constant being the keyword.  If the network hashrate is increasing very rapidly, as it has been, then blocks are solved at a quicker rate since difficulty only changes every 2016 blocks.  As a result the supply is greater, supply has been about 10-15% greater than it should be, which is significant.

How is the value of bitcoin determined?  A weighted average of certain exchanges I assume?  But I have not been able to find that info, anyone know?

I would totally agree with you if they were upfront and made it clear that it was unclear how long it would take to develop, but that was NOT the case.
Instead they promised delivery dates, and then kept saying that they would begin shipping in 2 weeks, when they DEFINITELY KNEW that they would NOT.  Willfully deceiving your customers and providing false information is fraud.

You can choose a fee in Multibit, it is under preferences.

This is the number 1 thing I thought of when I saw this thread title.  This really is a huge risk since it is not immediately obvious to new users.

"there's no evidence that they'll slow down."
Umm just no, the evidence is the publicly available data about the network hash rate.  Just do some research.  First, the network's rate of increase has not been constant at all...
Second, as I stated in my original post, the network hash rate's rate of increase has slowed since the last difficulty increase:

Very cool, I like these much more than any other physical coins I have seen yet.  Great work and good luck!

The price of bitcoin is relevant.  Electricity is paid in fiat.
@_date: 2013-08-24 06:55:27
So you really have no sympathy for all the early adopters that put in pre-orders and will not achieve ROI due to the difficulty increases?
I am glad everything worked out for you, but surely you can see that the way they treated other customers is completely ridiculous and inappropriate.
@_date: 2013-09-15 23:22:24
Yes, but those 100 btc would not help secure the network... He said in the title that he is not concerned about the ROI...
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:18:35
What is this nonsense?  Do you even understand bitcoin? People can just switch pools, what are you talking about?

Awesome site, but I would change the font of the categories' titles.  Very hard to see / read.  Also a place to view all the categories would be nice.

No, that is wrong.  This is an open-ended fund.  Value must be determined, and it explicitly states that NAV is calculated every day.  My question is how that value is determined.
And yes I agree that the value is not "determined," but for an open-ended fund it must be.

Could you provide more details on this?  What is a shared wallet?
@_date: 2013-08-25 20:16:31


I assume you mean price stability?  Price stability implies that supply =~ demand.  Therefore, if as I say, that supply is lower then price should increase.  
The change from GPU -&gt; FPGA -&gt; ASIC was a radical increase in difficulty.  The question is the rate of change.  Certainly difficulty is going to continue to increase dramatically, the question is the rate of change.  And I am just talking about the short term price since the OP was about what to do now.  
Also remember that people will be powering down machines as difficulty increases as well, but it is likely a minor effect.

"Butterfly Labs has shipped more ASIC products than all competitors combined"

Absolutely false by any measure.  I must admit, they are grade A scammers.
@_date: 2013-09-16 00:12:43
Umm what?  Nothing is wrong with producing ASIC hardware and selling it for a profit.  That is not "bad behavior."  The whole point is to make it difficult / impossible for bad actors / governments to be able to conduct a 51% attack on the network.  Increasing the network hash rate is not bad behavior. 
Does it suck that we, as old school miners, can't still easily make an ROI by buying graphic cards?  Yes, it kind of does, but the for the sake of bitcoin, it is needed.  And it is not "bad behavior."

I buy them to give as gifts to give to people when I explain bitcoin.  I also buy them to help secure the blockchain.  Bitcoin is far from invincible right now.

Please do this.  Personally I never ordered, but the bitcoin community really needs to take a stand against scammers of this magnitude.  Best of luck!

Great points and well stated IMHO.  Shows exactly why big corporations like Apple and Amazon don't want to succeed.  Apple won't allow wallet apps, and Amazon is trying to create its own online currency.

Buying, holding, and spending.  It looks like since the most recent difficulty increase, the network hash rate's rate of increase is slowing.  As a result supply will be a little lower than recently, and possibly move the price up more.
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:21:27
LOL--you make no sense, "I think miners are more concerned with profits than the integrity of the network."  
How could miners possibly be profitable if the integrity of the network is compromised?!  They must mine for the long term to recover the costs of the hardware.
@_date: 2013-05-18 23:41:19
Haha, so true
@_date: 2013-08-25 07:33:40
I don't really understand why he thinks its so "sobering" in Germany.  There are many stores that accept bitcoin as payment in a concentrated area--that is a great development.
What did he expect, everyone wearing bitcoin shirts and constantly talking or singing about bitcoin?  Its a currency that is accepted in all the major shops, thats the whole point... When it is mainstream it won't really be a huge deal, its just another form of currency.
@_date: 2013-09-15 23:24:25
This is total FUD.  The very first company you mention, CoinTerra, will not be mining for themselves.  And most of those companies (I believe all) are aimed at selling chips, not mining with them.  It doesn't matter who produced them, as long as they are distributed throughout the world, it is not centralized.
@_date: 2013-08-24 06:19:05
Yes, because they are large company in the bitcoin space, and having them run their huge scam without any backlash from the community gives people a very poor impression of bitcion as currency.  We, as the community, must show that we will not tolerate scammers.
Also I can see that BFL is truly a well run scam with plenty of shills as all of my posts pointing out their scams are immediately heavily downvoted.
In before the shills reply:  That's because you are wrong and the people love BFL!

K, it seems you are just trolling me but just on the off chance you aren't, just click here and look at the network hash rate, it has slowed dramatically since the last one:
Or just look at blocks mined since the difficulty change.  And a 20% difficulty increase is much different than  35% increase...

Could you further explain "client-side encryption" and it is different than Google Authenticator.  This is great, because I am always so worried about losing / breaking my iPhone.
