That's the right way. I also get some commisions in BTC and really love it.

Guys stay confident and unite. Nothing to worry about. The best thing you can do is not to touch BCH with cammel stick. Roger game hurt all currencies. He deserves the right answer. BCH is pure PR and nothing more. Bigger blocks only goes around the problem not solve it. Wait for Lightning Network to struck and see Roger face after that. Leave BCH market and show to the world and miners that nobody can control decentralization. Buy BTC and Hodl. Now is the time for the real decentralized quest. Show the world we can be united and strong and nobody can take our true BTC

It is about people - BTC is amazing inssurance against one wrong and broken exausted system. If people decide BTC cost to be 30-40 k it is people power

In fact I can't. But if BCH is ignored we will have more miners on BTC and adequate fees.

Hodl guys, be patient. Don't use BTC blockchain for now. Don't use BCH blockchain forever. Show that Roger and Jihan are mortal and people decide. Use alternative currencies if you want to transfer value. BTC one and only

Possible solution but suck BCH. That's the way to show resistance to BCH consorcium. Keep the king, guys!

You get it wrong guys. Do not spam BTC blockchain until its work ok. Use alts for now. If you don't use BCH one miners must back to BTC. They will be hungry on BCH. :)

I believe in factom from the begining. They are serious people and work hard. They do not drop bombs to the press every day. This is the coin with huge potential and it will show all of you its value

A lot of cash is out but that scares me is the control. China has 80 of mining power, now they can control or have informatin abot volume. It is not the end but slows the acceptance and puts a lot of question on the stage. Good luck to all  investors
