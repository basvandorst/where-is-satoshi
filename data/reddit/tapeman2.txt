To be honest I don't care about hungry kids in Africa. People probably shouldn't live where there isn't food or water. Yet all the billionaires love donating millions to that type of thing. Even while the infrastructure and healthcare are fucked in the countries where they have hundreds of thousands of employees. They make billions off of the work of government-educated employees, but government teachers make $30,000/yr. Yeah our politicians are garbage, but giving the rich tax breaks isn't going to help that. Plus our politicians are garbage because of the rich. They made citizens united happen, and now everyone just bribes congress to vote no on everything, so nothing's getting fixed.

To me that's a good reason to tax the rich. The rich are going to be rich, might as well make them pay for the things they've built their empires on top of.

How does this have so many upvotes when every comment is pointing out that this is a completely moronic comparison? Bitcoin isn't a government, neither is any other currency, why are your dicks hard over bitcoin still working?

There's literally nothing indicating that this is the bottom, enjoy watching your money vanish into thin air

The big ol dip it took. Downward trends continue until there's a pattern that convinces the market to start buying again

Why does this shit get posted so much? It's blatantly a bad way to use your money. "Oh no it's going down, if I just hold on to it until it comes back up I won't lose any money!!". Fuck that, that's stupid. If it's going down, and is clearly going down more, just take you 5% loss and wait for it to start going back up. Now instead of riding it down and up, you only rode it part way down, and then rode it back up and now you have a 15% gain instead of just breaking even.

I don't think proof of works are going to stay the same in the future. It's a really good area for innovation since all current coins just waste millions of dollars of electricity to power millions of dollars worth of chips to do pointless math. The coin that has a proof of work that actually produces something useful will take off to the moon, which will leave nvidia dead in the water after they change their whole business around sha256 and shit
