I have constant trouble with Windows flagging Electrum as a virus and removing it, despite trying to except it.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:39:37
This could be interesting, huh.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:50:44
I feel this way too, but a good part of me want to just go ahead and sell to help the dump along.

As a developer, what I hear there is "this isn't ready to deploy yet."
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:01:10
Anything else we can do? I'm currently voting with my money by purchasing btc. Is it helpful to run non-mining nodes at all?
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:37:10


Same here. I always wondered if I'd really get to see Bitcoin stand strong against entrenched powers.
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:30:03
Thanks, I was mainly looking at hitbtc which is using BCC instead.
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:07:32
People who held a lot of bitcoin cashing out their bcc. I think it was maybe bittrex early to open deposits but with a 20 confirmation wait time before trading, which is a day+, and just maybe yesterday hitbtc opened deposits with a 2 confirmation wait. So people who held their own bitcoin have just through today started having those coins available to trade, and many are moving them to bitcoin, litecoin, monero, etc. expecting that bcc will crash in value over the next several days. It started out trading at around 0.2 bitcoin and it's been between 0.06 and 0.075 for hours now.

This guide is decent. It's for Electrum but the general concept still applies.
You want to move your BTC from the wallet(s) you've been holding them in to a completely new wallet with new private key (if it's Electrum you want to create a completely new wallet with a new seed phrase, not just send to a new address under the same seed phrase).
Some guides suggested sending a bit of post-fork bitcoin to your current BTC wallets before moving the full balance(s) to a new BTC wallet.
Then you can import the private key for the wallet(s) you just moved all your BTC out of into a BCH/BCC (I guess I still don't know what it's being called really) wallet and you'll have all your BCH safely separated from your BTC.
Then you can send you BCC/BCH to anywhere that's taking deposits if you want to trade it for something else. Confirmations were taking about 75 minutes each earlier but right now we're 3.5 hours since the last block mined.

I don't expect answers because I'm just some random on the internet. But as a small holder and a high bandwidth node operator I have to wonder..
Did the miners who didn't want segwit explain why they opposed that? If it was disadvantageous to them, perhaps in operating costs or rewards earned, that could be quantified. Maybe they did and you've all seen that, but if not that could help, show they were serious if that's in question, and a quantifiable cost that needs to be replaced with incentive might be more palatable to the community.
I see several posts like these around: 
But perhaps that's not a use case Bitcoin is useful for right now.
And as a last thought, if we felt like the processing of blocks wasn't being all screwed with right now, yet were still full with high fees, that might build community support between now and November. The mining pool is tomfoolery right now though and it's not helping at all.

I'm a newb so I'm probably at least half wrong here but one thing distinct about Ethereum is it's ability to execute smart contracts (not so distinct these days, but Eth has the market cap) - contracts enforced by a trustless blockchain-based system. Segwit provides a path to implement the same kind of functionality but tied to Bitcoin's blockchain instead of Ethereum's.

Bitcoin 2.0 /s
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:26:05
What if transaction fees are so high, or so much capital needs to be locked up, that it ends up not even being feasible to run a LN node as an average person?
It's hard to see where that might end up. Sounds nice, I'm a tech, I get mesh networks and scale, but we've never seen this system in action.
At least I know what was Bitcoin, until recently with over full blocks, works well.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:02:07
Welcome to Coinbase. If you try to sell, they only give you the lower amount on the dashboard.
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:47:49
Because unless you had BTC on one of just a few exchanges it was a bit of a process splitting BTC &amp; BCH safely, waiting for exchanges to accept BCH deposits, and long waits for BCH confirmations before people could trade. A lot of people started depositing to Bittrex with a 20 confirmation wait before being allowed to trade them.. that's well over a day. Everyone who waited a couple days after the fork to split and deposit to trade BCH off started being able to trade over the last 24 hours or so, and probably a lot are still waiting. I expect a good deal more dumping of BCH and buying of BTC and other alts throughout the day.

I have no side. I'm just an idiot who decided mid-June was finally the time I could and would take up a financial stake in cryptocurrency.
That may be the narrative, but I don't see Core devs saying that. In fact, there has been a lot of refreshingly level-headed, detailed conversation of late.
What I've seen Core devs saying is that a hard fork is certainly not off the table forever, but it needs to be well justified and take an abundance of care in the testing and rollout. I see them say this is a particularly bad time to rush forward. And most importantly, I see them say that agreeing to 2x and following through would be kowtowing to political pressure, allowing it to change the fundamentals of the protocol, opening an as-yet-still-closed door that violates _the_ core tenant of bitcoin that many think is not only the reason for it's appreciating value but of any value at all and its raison d'etre.
But I don't know jack. I'm just some Joe who was utterly convinced of the need for and potential of cryptocurrency and bitcoin specifically more than 5 years ago but still waited until this June to put down, and then threw all his money into the middle of this shit show. I can't even hold both sides because more than half my stake was acquired after the hard fork.

I hear Coinbase isn't very good at answer support emails, even on accounts getting locked with thousands of dollars. Maybe I should tweet them.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:03:33
I bought at $3160. Lots more bch to get sold. We're not done rallying yet.
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:23:21


But do you think both will survive? It seems like there could still be a use for the other blockchain. It mirrors some financial systems we already have today; they could use it among themselves and stay mostly in their own playground.

What meetups are these?
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:35:40
I checked your post history and you seem like an actual person so I hope you hear me out.
I was thinking about this.. what kind of transactions might they be. Spam, ok, that's possible. I thought of another common use case that might make a whole lot of small transactions with small fees - coin mixers.
Coin mixers pretty much need to be used with Bitcoin to be fungible. We've seen this year with all the dark net market busts how the government can track transactions through the Blockchain.
And now Bitcoin is going to drive up transaction fees; they're happy with $100 for a transaction. $100 a transaction. What? Lightning Network seemed cool (except for the risk of being a receiver node, and the capital needed, and the cost of closing and opening anything in the future). But $100 transaction fee really doesn't look much like Bitcoin anymore.
I'm a developer. My first instinct is to listen to something like an open-source development based groups. Centralized Chinese miners sound bad and scary. I think there's some narratives getting pushed.
Coin mixers get used a lot to keep funds private going in and out of dark markets. Blockstream wants to price coin mixer transactions out. Hmmm. Spam, I mean spam. Transactions with no economic value, right? Fungibility isn't an important aspect, nah.
Cheap, easy, anonymous, secure. That's bitcoin. Speaking of secure, lots of missing bitcoin out there, a lot of people wonder what happened to them.. Mt Gox, BTC-e, Dream, Hansa..
It's also kind of interesting how in the midst of a years long battle with massive division, high fees pricing people out, and two forks in short order, how Bitcoin just keeps going up and up and up and up. Wonder who's buying all of that? What might the price be if the community was united and aligned and scaled and smooth for the last two years?

I'm pretty busy and put it off longer than I should have. Had I been on the ball I could've traded out at the early high point. If you get on it now you can trade out at the price it's been holding since the main drop.
This guide made it very straightforward. I had mine off to an exchange with a 2 confirmation wait time in just a few minutes, despite sitting there nervously triple checking everything before clicking the next button.
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:01:28
I can't tell you what to do.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:42:53
I'm not sure that it is, I just saw it in some of the earlier discussions about splitting and thought I should mention it in case I was missing some reason why it might be necessary. I did not do that myself.

Didn't like $100M of Ethereum just get stolen from people's wallets? 2/3rd's of it by white hats who returned it, but still, someone made off with $35M+.
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:48:50




Most of the transactions on Bitcoin going to and from trading exchanges doesn't sound like a good situation for stability. Am I missing something else being implied?
I saw this exact question come up in a live stream debate tonight and it really raised my eyebrow. Richard Heart definitely acted like he might know but dodged answering: 
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:48:30




Careful what you listen to, and think about what Bitcoin is supposed to be and which fork fits those ideals better.

I'd be curious to hear if you see any potentially useful features from Nexus, or if that falls in with your opinion on the rest of altcoins. They at least take the stance that they aren't trying to replace Bitcoin but be a test bed for possible features to later be incorporated in Bitcoin proper if found useful and with acceptable trade-offs. Their feature list reads like a laundry list of things you could argue are problematic in Bitcoin, though they don't bother to discuss the trade-offs much.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:46:37
Do you even own a single Bitcoin? You've been "following" since 2008 but still under the thumb of student loans?
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:43:34
Thanks. That's kinda what I thought, but it's nerve wracking, even as a simple holder.
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:28:28
This seems like a risky position to be in during the interim if there's contention, or no? If I hold btc in electrum and they are determining I can transact on one chain, but another chain is taking over, I might be stuck until it's more settled and electrum decides (or not, and then what) to transact on the other chain?
