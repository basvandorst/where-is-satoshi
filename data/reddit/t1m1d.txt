It's listed in the specs, however from what I can see, the pictures are literally just [this open source project]( There's no room in their case for a hard drive, so they're probably just assembling the kit and throwing in an external hard drive. I wouldn't buy from them.

I believe that he's saying that the most common side effect is headaches, but he didn't get any.

Old versions of Electrum support messages with rich text. Someone set up a malicious server on the Electrum network, which sends these messages when it sees an IP trying to send.

The thieves could have shared the private key or not kept it secure.
I know it's not likely but there is now a possibility that this is a third party attempting to get the stolen coins from the original thieves.

0.00067 USD per bitcoin? You wrote the title wrong. It should be 0.00067 BTC per dollar.

It still went up a lot. I spent like 120k Dogecoin a few years ago, checked prices a few weeks ago and kinda flipped.

That white box just means the funds are unconfirmed. Don't worry, that's normal. The bitcoin client checks the blockchain to make sure the transaction is legit, usually 6 times. A new block comes out every 10 minutes, so it should take an hour or so.
Again, this is completely normal! Multibit is just being safe :)
And as far as your bonus question goes... I have no idea. Sorry, I've been looking for something like this as well.

Well, it looks like they eventually ended up in [this wallet]( after being sent around a lot. You could request a payment from the address. It seems to handle large numbers of coins.
