Raspberry Pi 2 + Cheap 0.9" OLED display. Worth mentioning that this node is in Malaysia, the owner is of slightly upper middle class socioeconomic background, with 5Mbps residential fiber internet. Also balance is fake.

Since the number given is watts/hash, different hashing algorithms I guess? And a million other variables. Just saying that reduction in transistor gate widths result in a square of that reduction in processor area. We really really like to make transistors smaller.

Nope. And I'm paying RM155(US$40) a month for it too. 20Mbps is US$70. 4G on my phone is faster.
Technically my ISP can provide gigabit, but they won't because they're a monopoly and will stiff us on bandwidth for as long as they possibly can.
[Their incompetence also broke the internet last week.](

It'll take way more than 80k to make it stick more than a few blocks.

Roughly speaking, power per area remains the same. 2.5W/(110nm^2) ~= 0.06W/(16nm^2). Gotta square those widths.

Are you a disillusioned teenager in lowyat.net? This is what I thought until I actually spent a few years living in the US. At least not to the extent I thought it was.
My suggestions: get in touch with [these folks] ( And be friends with people in bank negara and the ministry of finance.

I think there needs to be a way to anonymize the recipient address while still ensuring the person is a legit voter.

did not know that. Thanks!

I understand mining more now. Thanks! 1000 bits

At current time, you need 500 bits to get confirmation within 3 blocks. 1200 bits to confirm within 1 block.

Mine didn't crash, but I limit dbcache to 50MB.

Didn't check too often, but I got 15-20k transactions. I had the default 8 outbound, and 60 inbound connections. Maybe I don't see as many transactions because I'm in SE Asia.
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:50:35
Because they don't have enough RAM or slow CPU?

Could this be a good deterrent against SPV mining if these transactions are commonplace?

$19 Teensy 3.1, $6 2.4" 320x240 touchscreen, $3 ESP8266 wifi. I think these can work too.
