Poor fuckers?
Do you know what a 0 sum game is?

Ok.  'Loser' was not a misnomer.
You are a troll.  Die hard.  Kudos on that.  No food for you.

"Blah blah blah please bitcoins are down again blah blah buy and stop selling so my holdings go up blah blah"
"No. Just can't get as excited about the thousand grade school level pseudo-intellectual essays that get spammed to new as other people here.
Your post sucked. I think we both know that, deep down."
Trolling wrapped in BS white knighting...
If you provided a substantive argument, I might approach this all differently.  So far you haven't provided anything.

Nice sidestep.  Answers my challenge.
Carry on.

3 years ago they were at 2$... so more like 25k right now.

Lol.  Right.  Way to avoid having an opinion. 
Don't let me keep you from not making a difference somewhere else.
@_date: 2013-12-20 05:30:53
Lol, it actually looks like you've been making points lately.  I am going to live under the delusion that I got you to stop just taking pot shots and you started participating meaningfully because of me.
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:05:19
Let me take a guess...
You were a trader.  You managed to hussle up a few hundred dollars on your knees and pulled it onto an exchange thinking you were going to make BIG money.  
Then you got all emotional, pulled a bunch of money out of your husbands account, lost it all and then started blaming the world for your stupid decisions.
Now you go around railing about how unfair it all is and criticizing people that have actually &lt;gasp&gt; pulled positive ROI in bitcoin.

I await the opportunity for you to prove yourself as anything other than another worthless shitbag on the internet with nothing except criticism in the face of actual thoughts and ideas.
So far, you're as worthless as the content of your posts.  Feel free to prove me wrong with actual thoughts and actually exposing your actual beliefs in a way that they might actually be criticized.  
If not, you're a fucking loser, which you probably already know.

Not using the system would undo it.  
It(the status quo) only works because it's necessary to our normal functioning.  No one would keep money in a system that took all their money if they could see how it was taking all their money.  
It's only because of the lack of a valid alternative that it isn't more clear.  The ultra rich control the banks which control fiat and they use fiat to keep themselves the most rich.  If we have alternative medium for transferrance of wealth and we use it more, it will cause the relative value of fiat against it to fall.  Potentially if people hold value in it, it will cause the fiat currency to become massively inflationary, which would undermine it.
I don't suggest that will happen, but it's a small step on the path of dealing with problems rife in fiat in today's global oligarchy.

Oh my god are you trolling me!?!?  I'm so honored!  I mean... I'm sure that your life is so jam packed with good things that you only troll people to help remind you that not all of life is as awesome.
I sure hope I can be as great as you one day!
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:18:18
See, you make the statement 'awful post', but you don't really qualify it.  To me, that means I should disregard it and not give a fuck.  You could be talking about my grammar.  You could be talking about maybe a factual inaccuracy.  You could disagree with my opinions, but you don't really explain that.
See that's how people like you work.  If you never have an opinion besides hating my opinion, you never have to be vulnerable.  Or at least that is the appearance you hope for. 
Whatever white knight purpose you want to convey is a cover for what you really are.  A coward.

Well, thank bitcoin for your gold.  Lol.  
Most my holdings are in LTC anyway.
