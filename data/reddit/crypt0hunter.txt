what kind of messed up market is going on... ive been day trading since 3 months changed 50 usd to 12000 usd... and nw this market is shit... unpredictable as F***....
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:06:47
trust me this market is ez to flip... day traded to 300 and went all in on rpx... flipped to 1 k.... then went all in on wabi... got 4k from wabi rode the train and made it 8 k... did some simple day trading(neo) and btc shot up to 20 k
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:31:24
Bitcoin domination is breaking everyday... Its down to 36 percent... Market cap is growing but money is not pushed into bitcoin... I have a strong feeling some coin is gna dethrone btc this year...
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:15:35

I m not here to fud guys... but i own a bitcoin and i started with a v less price like less than 100 usd... i day traded my way till here... so if i loose money it doesnt matter to me....
the question is if bitcoin doesnt start to implement on lightning network things will get laggy with 1mb block and price for transaction will keep going up... the main motto of nakamoto was to have fast peer to peer transaction will less transaction fees.... but now both are breaking down... ppl see this as free money and do not focus on technology... can this lead to a CRASH(i dnt believe its a bubble).... if it goes down as a bubble do u think all cryptos are doomed like ETH, NEO, LTC, etc
