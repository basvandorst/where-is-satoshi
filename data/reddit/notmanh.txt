@_date: 2015-02-24 03:43:28
Alleged, really ? 
Mintpal was a good exchange before that guy took it over and ran it in the ground.
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:22:34
I don't get the reference.
@_date: 2015-02-08 10:55:21
Only in Canada, but it works perfectly and easily.
@_date: 2015-02-04 07:34:21
Better is quite an understatement.

Nice keyboard.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:27:23
Amaizing!  Between the Bitcoin Embassy in Montreal (unbelievable place btw), Bitcoiniacs in Vancouver and now the Bitcoin Alliance in Toronto launching, all I can say is bravo Canada!
