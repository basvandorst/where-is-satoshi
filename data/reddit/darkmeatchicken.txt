I know somebody who got a life insurance policy payout after their spouse died (about 7 years ago).  They were so upset over the grief, they just chose to make a small handful of super risky individual stock picks.  If they hit, they were going to quit their job, buy a boat, learn how to sail and sail for most of the year and do odd jobs for the rest.  If the stocks flopped, it wasn't meant to be.
Caught a multi-bagger.  Sold.  Bought the boat.  Met someone new. 
Got married.  They are about to set sail for a multi-month trip.
I'm pretty sure they're at peace about the loss now and view this new life as a final gift from their deceased partner.

And if it put in antonyms for adjectives, then the internet would just break.   Actually we should just convince disqus (et al) to do it automatically.  So many racists/sexists heads would explode when their post shows up as "Damn Obama.  What a smart white person!"

Which exchange did you use?  I'm looking to do the same.

Electric horses are dangerous so pretty much everywhere requires licensing and regulations on manufacturers and age limits and etc etc.
Not the best analogy if you are in the "completely unregulated bitcoin" camp. 
People seem to say "oops.  MtGox will happen in a free market".  What is so wrong with treating Bitcoin like a commodity - like gold?  If someone tells me they are selling me gold, take my money and never deliver - I can prosecute them... right?

There is a difference between "giving a long speech" and filibustering.  You can't filibuster a bill that isn't currently on the floor.  Technically he is filibustering the TPP (but not really even that, as it wasn't due up for a vote until 12 hours after he started).
This is a stunt.  Not a filibuster.  It has no potential to impact the vote on the renewal of the patriot act.
Important stuff for sure, but this man knows more about political grandstanding than anything resembling principle.

But did buy the Resident's tee with Bitcoin?

Cash on cash back cards is theoretically taxed.

Why are they a con?  Coal mining gives crypto a bad name.  Renewables would make a lot more sense!

Well, to be fair, it only shrinks "real world" market cap if Bitpay/Coinbase/etc is taking the coins out of circulation.  It probably doesn't count "taking them out of circulation" if the processors are hoarding them or parceling them into investment vehicles for ibanks - though they would be removed from the real world marketplace unless they are being exchanged frequently.
The reality is, the only thing that shrinks the market cap of bitcoin is lost hard drives and forgotten passwords.
But yes, this IS a way to support the bitcoin network, bitcoin accepting merchants (developers in this case), while retaining the original bitcoins, while spending fiat at a slight markup.
In many cases, I'm sure deals/prices are good enough that a BTC evangelist will happily pay the extra transaction costs to keep the network alive and kicking and prove bitcoins viability as a real currency.
I get it.  This is a way to hoard and continue spending fiat, while creating the illusion of BTC usage.  And in fact, it creates DOUBLE usage - because the coins are being bought back.

A bunch of people like this feature, but I'm confused why.
In this scenario, you spend BTC (- transaction fees), those coins buy a giftcard which buy the product, then you buy the BTC back with a bank transfer (- transaction fees)?  
So isn't this the same as buying at amazon with a bank transfer?  
I see some value here - mainly, that the BTC network is handling these transactions and perhaps that you are functionally buying stuff at amazon out of your bank account.
What am I missing?

Right, but with instant buyback of the BTC, my point was that people aren't really spending their BTC.  They are spending fiat and paying the BTC and developers transaction fees.  They are functionally keeping their BTC.
