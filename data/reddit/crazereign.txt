Serialized block number coins would be cool. Common blocks could be silver and milestone blocks could be gold. Thus, limited supply of physical coins with intrinsic value.

If Coinbase was listed on the Nasdaq their stock would be going through the roof right now.

I see your point. If each coin in tied to a block, and block creation never ends, it would be inflationary. I was just coming at it from a collectors point of view, and not so much as a medium of exchange. There would still only be one of each coin. The Genesis Block coin would be a prize to own.

annoyance leads to awareness. Google chrome is already integrating a changetip button, which will address the spam issue.

I chose a popular "beauty guru" channel video, [ to begin flooding. I chose it because of the high subscriber count, 3 million. I started it off, lets see if I get some help.

I've been solo tipping on YouTube on random videos I like. If we could coordinate our tipping efforts, perhaps, "Money bombing" a particular high view count video, I think that would have a greater impact. If its massive enough, it could generate some publicity, and more content creators would sign up for changetip as a result.

I just got done booking a hotel in the SF Bay Area using Expedia and it was pretty easy. Expedia uses Coinbase as their payment processor, and I also have a Coinbase account. When you go to checkout, you can use the pay with Coinbase option, which I did, and it was instant; within seconds I received a confirmation/itinerary email from Expedia and one from Coinbase confirming the transaction. I still expect that I may have to use my credit card when checking-in at the hotel, for the deposite, but the back-end of this transaction went smoothy.
