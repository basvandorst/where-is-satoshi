Yes but the SEC’s final deadline to approve or deny the two ProShares Bitcoin ETFs is next Thursday, August 23.... 
@_date: 2018-08-06 06:20:52
wow I like it, awesome work!
@_date: 2018-08-10 06:24:40
And use Tor, otherwise it is still not 90% private. 100% untracable, forget it. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 09:01:07
Just found your question here. Block.io is another online wallet you can use for Testnet.
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:14:58
Yep, correct
@_date: 2018-08-10 09:27:25
I know. that's why I said "90%" privacy. Always keep in mind possible backdoors or (0day) software bugs.
@_date: 2017-02-24 18:58:11
I don't think that is possible.
@_date: 2017-02-17 15:16:38
Back then, I couldn't read my tea leaves as I should have.
@_date: 2017-02-02 11:30:17
You can do it with Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:47:31
Can Europeans buy in too? Think the shares will be sold out really quick.
@_date: 2017-02-24 18:43:10
I think that isn't an import but a sweep you did. And so it takes a transaction cost. A sweep is an internal wallet transaction to another private key. As it is a transaction it has to be added to a block.
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:20:20
Wow, all these cool replies :) I love the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-02-19 19:26:56
Respect man! ;-)
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:40:02
I still need a nice sweatshirt with HODL :)
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:20:46
Didn't knew about Bitsquare, they seem to have a really great interface and it was easy to install on a mac. And Tor nodes, wow!
@_date: 2017-02-14 10:32:50
too bad, it should :-)
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:20:56
Haha, this guy really should educate himself.
@_date: 2017-02-04 15:54:31
Could this have the same outcome as ETH vs ETC?
@_date: 2019-03-27 10:58:41
Congrats! Is there a version of StegSolve for mac or another Stego tool?
@_date: 2019-03-20 14:07:03
@_date: 2019-11-12 09:41:23
And then we could put the gold specks back into the bank vault and ... ��
@_date: 2018-10-24 16:19:10
Yep, VPN and pizza to name a few.
@_date: 2017-01-09 13:41:23
Wow, maybe I should be a Cryptosteel too
@_date: 2017-01-11 09:45:35
wow, time to buy in
@_date: 2017-01-14 13:58:36
Thanks for your good post and great advice. Why didn't I think about that myself :) 
@_date: 2017-01-26 15:12:58
Certainly! I use a Nano S for multiple cryptocurrency wallets. Just added the Stratis wallet too. Love it :)
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:41:24
More news from China = more dumps (or buying opportunities)
@_date: 2016-12-07 07:51:09
Thanks, it worked after half a day :-)
@_date: 2016-12-06 09:32:01
How can I perform a rebroadcast? Can I do this via Electrum?
@_date: 2016-12-06 08:34:15
My tx is still unconfirmed since yesterday 2016-12-05 17:35:38 :( just tried the viabtc tool so crossing fingers now.
@_date: 2016-12-06 13:09:39
ok, finally confirmed :)
@_date: 2019-08-15 11:25:45
I think so. "Nikola Tesla free energy concept was patented in 1901 as an “Apparatus for the Utilization of Radiant Energy.” "
@_date: 2019-08-14 10:09:13
Forget all that. Zeropoint energy is the thing and it already is in use in the MIC.
@_date: 2019-02-07 14:34:09
I got this popup too and at the same time, it was months ago I opened this Electrum version. So at first I thought, ok, maybe I have to update but I think I recalled an earlier phishing attempt with the same MO. I just went to the official Electrum website and downloaded from there.
This is a very well made lure, never download any stuff from links in emails or popups.
@_date: 2019-02-15 07:48:19
Nope not Windows ;-)
@_date: 2019-04-04 10:02:58
Seems correct. The only time the blockchain is used is to note the status before the channel opened and after the channel closes. :)
@_date: 2017-04-11 17:24:38
That's what I think too but maybe these malware authors wanna give it a try anyway.
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:31:58
You're so kind :)
@_date: 2019-02-19 08:12:55
He forgot to add "/s"
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:58:29
Ha, that’s the CEO of bitcoin suisse. ��
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:22:26
interesting story
