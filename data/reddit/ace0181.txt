What app is that?

Just gotta zoom out. There's a ton of buy orders at lower prices. aka people willing to buy the dip.

We did it boys!

Uh what. Gdax has a 0.25% fee for getting in or out of a position. Or am I mistaken?
Edit: just read up and looks like the fees apply only if you are a taker. Market makers have no fees.

You mean 9k will be the new support. Not resistance.

But my meme is what the world had envisioned! Also, I'm telling you nicely - it is bitcoin cash, and not bcash!

Depending on the exchange, there are  a few different options.
Good till fill
Good till time xx:xx:xx
Fill or kill
See here for a detailed explanation on the ones supported by GDAX.
Edit: Generally speaking, you don't want orders close to the trading price sitting overnight on a volatile asset like BTC; since a 10-20% move can occur quite easily.

What you see here is a standard depth chart. BTC price in USD is on the X axis, and the # of cumulative orders (buy or sell) are represented on Y axis. Green represents buy orders, while red represents sell orders. The meme here is Viserion taking one for the team to get us through the wall of sell orders leading up to 10K :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:02:51
thats exactly right. the y-axis gives the # of orders outstanding at prices depicted by the x-axis.
