I've never seen someone so sure, about something they know nothing about. Do some research next time you want to spout your opinion publicly. I can obviously see which side of the bell curve you're on.

I did not find this to be the case. And really what needs to be said is this:
  
"Politically, Peterson has described himself as a classic British liberal, and has stated that he is commonly mistaken to be right wing. He is a philosophical pragmatist." -Wikipedia

This comment could not be more wrong. His work is mainly in the realm of psychology, theology, and mythology. Most people don't actually read his book "Maps of Meaning" because it's pretty heavy stuff. It runs the gamut from Lao Tzu, to Huxley, Joyce, Jung Hawking, to Tolstoy. That book alone has over 360 references... things like, "Hemisphere differences in the acquisition and use of descriptive systems" and "An enquiry into the functions of the septal-hippocampal system." The guy is a serious scholar.
He's no more alt-right than Joseph Campbell, Carl Jung, or Alan Watts. His work avoids politics for the most part. Only recently, and only online, have you seen him talking about politics, mostly because he was attacked for speaking out against government mandated speech. He is the exact opposite of Trump.

So true. This all just makes Bcash look sad. He's actually pleading with them to take his money and support his centralized coin.
And like always, Roger just keeps repeating the same talking points ad infinitum et nauseum. He should sell used cars.

But Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney is cursed...that's bad.
