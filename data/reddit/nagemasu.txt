That's confusing as fuck and deceptive too. That's what bcash is to Bitcoin.

Nah, most of us were smart enough to move our BTC off exchanges when we were told to, before the fork.  
  
Sold my BCH a few weeks ago before the price crashes at the end of this month with everyone else doing the same.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:02:56
lol, there was, is and has been a ridiculous number of posts about holding your private keys and not leaving them on exchanges for forks for this exact reason, amount others.     
There were countless "How to prepare for the hard fork" articles and posts on the web.   
    
By "Casual user" did you really mean "ignorant and/or arrogant enough not to either research the technology you're investing your money in and/or ignore all advice given to help secure your investment"?  
  
Who exactly is "casually" investing money into an emerging and highly volatile technology? There's no casual about it, and if there is, it's your own fault for being so blasé.

Only if the heirs speak up. But it would be safe to assume some of those really large wallets belong to Hal.  
  
He says his heirs are pretty tech savy, so it would be interesting if they decided to do some research themselves to find out if Hal was Sataoshi seeing as they likely have access to this PC.  
  
That being said, with the value they hold, they would be wise never speaking publicly about anything to do with btc.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:36:37


Yeah, they forked, as is allowed. But now they're trying to claim the name of the project they forked from, which is still operating. And *that* is what the issue is.  
  
No one gives a fuck Bcash exists, it's that they're trying to take over the name Bitcoin and essentially snuff the original Bitcoin out.

can't remember the name of the exchange but one of them has said they will sell all the Bcash end of dec, and coinbase have said they will release theirs to users start of Jan.   
  
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:42:02
Have you talked to him? For such a large amount he may be willing to negotiate the fee (The website also implies it's negotiable). 20% might be based on 1-2 btc. Offer him 10,000 and see how he feels.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:54:32
Should reducing use, and specifically user, fees, not be one of their top priorities?  
Coinbase aren't struggling to stay afloat, they have more than enough money to hire additional staff and pay for the additional resources to ensure updates and changes are made in a timely manner.

I have no idea why this is mentioned everytime someone talks about r/btc. It's not relevant.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:02:58
BTC won't dip just because some of them may move. Or even if they just all move to another wallet. It'd be very hard for someone to sell that much BTC though.  
  
Those coins could very much be owned. If Hal is Satoshi, there's a good chance some of those coins are waiting to be inherited.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:42:31

I'm not scared of panicking. I'm just sick of the fucking "HODL. DON' SELL" garbage in abundance here. Everything screams fundamentalist. I check this sub for news and discussion of substance, but I'm bombarded with 100 price memes and others screaming "HODL" and thinking their word of "don't panic sell" holds anymore meaning than the guy who posted it 10 minutes prior.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:05:09
no you're making assumptions. No one actually knows what would happen. But If those coins were sold it wouldn't affect the market much in terms of the coins value. It could have some change in regards to how people feel about bitcoin and therefore change the value, but it's assumptions and speculation.

The sad thing is that it's kind of needed. bcash and r/btc want to stamp out bitcoin as they believe bcash is the 'real bitcoin' and Bitcoin is a fraud. They spout false claims of ponzi schemes and spread fear all over reddit and the internet.   
  
Things like this are about separating BTC from BCH as distinctly as possible. Which I am all for.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:44:18
Panics from what? At what point do people stop calling the dips "panic sells"? The only people here panic here are people like you, over *others* selling for whatever reasons they have.

They seem to be a trustworthy company, they're not malicious in any way I believe, they just seem to have issues and bugs they need to work out - they're probably growing faster than they can handle.

@_date: 2017-12-04 07:31:31
The claims like "defies critics" and similar tones are just news hype at this point. I've never personally seen an anti bitcoin article on a new site. Usually it's just about how it's doing and then some generic financial advice from a banker/financial advisor.

Cool thanks for the reply. Look forward to hearing more about that when it happens then.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:08:01


  
This kind of thing is a turn off tbh. I almost have 1btc but knowing so many people don't, and never will makes me think I've got more to lose than other people. This doesn't instill a sense of security or faith in Bitcoin and others who use the system.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:02:51
What valid reason is there to not implement it *now*?  
  
They've had months to work on it, and there's literally no one or nothing holding them back (i.e. they have the man power and money to do it).
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:11:20
Yeah, that's actually a more concerning issue. Bitcoin dot com is 100% not an official website and is run by people who have more interest in BCH than BTC
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:29:00
"Easily" is subjective. You couldn't really do it all at once. You would do it over a course of days/weeks/months. Few exchanges let you withdraw fiat over a certain amount, and that amount is well below 1million.

hey thanks for the response. Is there somewhere I can read more on this?  
  
Also, why do we need more than 1 application (both on device and chrome apps)? Why can't it just be an an all-in-one app that can manage addresses over multiple blockchains/cryptos? for example, the way I can load my Jaxx wallet and just select between each crypto in a tab style?  
Is it just for security reasons?
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:39:01
I'm so over these posts. The people you're targeting don't visit this sub, everyone here has seen this fucking post 100 times. You're not some bitcoin guru spreading wise information.  
  
Regardless, people don't panic sell anymore. The people who're actually selling are cashing out or are traders making calls, they're the people in @_date: 2017-12-18 15:27:16


You're not. It's no differen't than bringing a bank card which has access to the same funds. They want to know if you're bringing cash in physically.

"Hey not many people worldwide are actually putting money into crypto yet. Why not jump into this highly volatile market"  
  
These claims do not instill a sense of faith and security, or encourage anyone to actually buy.  
  
Bitcoin is still a high risk investment, not only should we urge caution and research first, instead of spreading FOMO, but statements like this can be interpreted either way depending on the person.

Honestly wish they would increase the storage on them. They can only handle 3-4 wallet apps before you have to delete one for put another one. For reference, thats:  
  
BTC  
ETH  
LTC  
+ potentially one more (some times I can get another on, sometimes not).  
  
It's really annoying to delete and reinstall wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:29:44
Yeah that's a lot easier to follow, but then it would be the same people making two currencies, but US / Russia are separate entities, as are the developers/minds behind BTC and BCH.   
  
  
How about, it's like Catalonia splitting off from Spain and trying to make their own currency called the Euro Cash.   
  
Regardless, all the situations are confusing and would be simplified by taking the original name out and using a new unrelated name.  
  
  
It's literally the only issue anyone who sides with Bitcoin has with BCH - they use Bitcoin in the name and try to claim it is *the* Bitcoin while spreading fear and misinformation, whereas bcash literally do not want to co-exist.

What the fuck are you on about. Somehow something totaling $1 after fees means that the whole thing is fees? Do you under stand percentages?   
And again, are you ignoring the part where I've said:  
  


  
So if it cost me $1 to move $650, why would a $1 coffee be 100% fees? Read between the fucking lines you twit. I'm not arguing this anymore. If you don't like the current fees, feel free to create a solution or stop using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:42:26
Not really true at all. If you look at all the deleted threads in r/bitcoin and r/btc you'll find a similar level of deletion and similar content being deleted, with r/btc appearing to be slightly more heavy handed.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:29:55
That's in Ho Chi Minh City, so your cup of coffee might end up being $1 including fees. Regardless, I literally just moved 0.09btc ($650usd) and the cost was about $1 I'm pretty sure.

I'm not sure why anyone thinks anything can be done. No one here owns the sub reddit or even has access to it. The people at r/btc don't give a fuck what we think of it either.  
  
We're better off trying to clean this sub up and turn it into a more official Bitcoin sub so that when people visit they aren't instantly turned away by the endless memes and shit posts.  
  
I'm also going to take a second to point out that whoever the fuck registered bitcoin.org instead of going for the .com alternative is a fucking idiot. .org means *organisation*. How is that in line with the Bitcoin concept?

@_date: 2017-11-14 07:30:08
They believe BCH is the real Bitcoin. Right now it's not certain how they will play their hand or what they will do, but it's definitely on the cards that in future they will market BCH as just "Bitcoin".  
  
It's not that they may own pizza.com and try to sell you BigMac's, it's that they own pizza.com and may claim that their BigMac's *are* pizza. That is what is worrisome.

@_date: 2017-11-15 23:00:22

Did you see where I wrote:  
  


  
My point was simply that coffee (or food/drink in general) is so cheap in Veitnam that whatever fees you pay to purchase with BTC is insignificant to the final amount paid for what you get. Don't read into *that* statement any further than that.  
  
The "Why the shit are people still complaining about fees" is in regards to the following comments in which I have stated I paid roughly $1 or so to move $650 usd of BTC. And I find *that* insignificant.

He is being blunt yes, but he's right. The guy could have known not to use them if he had done 5 minutes of research.  
  
Just imagine if he was handling your money, you would also be this blunt. This isn't good for anyone, this is why people think BTC is a scam and people like OP who are negligent are not helping.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:42:56
Yep, but I have no doubts it will come back up at least a bit. I'm sure Ver will help with that because as soon as people see BCH sinking they will jump ship, so he will do his best. There will also be people who truely believe in BCH buying in for cheap. So it will be worth picking up a little bit even if it's not a full coin, and then sitting on it and seeing if BCH ramps up in future, or just waiting for it to level out and off loading for a bit of profit.
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:05:40
There's no right answer until after the fact. No one can predict the future, so no one can tell you if it was a smart move otherwise we would all be filthy rich by now. The only way this becomes a "not smart move" is when it goes below the price you bought in at and never bounces back.

But then exchanges are dumping end of Dec and Coinbase releases their BCH Jan 1st. Im expecting cheap coins during this time, and then shortly after I imagine Ver and the BCH community will go into a "Cheap coin and pump" frenzy causing BCH to raise before it becomes unsustainable and people sell out before the crash.

BCH doesn't even have half the transactions of BTC.   
  
Think of BCH as driving the streets at night, and BTC as driving during the day.   
At night, there's not even any peak hours so it's rare for there ever to be hold ups. In the day, things can go pretty smooth but it's still a bit busier, but you can also hit traffic in peak periods.  
  
We're still doing urban development to handle more traffic on the roads, while BCH doesn't even need to yet.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:56:13

It reflects badly on this sub and BTC when it is simply bashing. I'm all for sharing facts and discrediting false claims in defense, but being the attacker is not productive.  
  
You may not think so, as someone with a understanding of bitcoin already, but when new people come to this sub and see this it comes across very differently. It's like walking into a room where a bunch of strangers are talking shit about the guy in the next room. No one comes out looking good.

Should I be able to enter my seed phrase into any wallet that allows and the balance should match the last one?  
  
Jaxx shows I have 0.6btc, But the app crashed so I entered my phrase into mycelium  which spent about 2 hoiurs loading the wallet and then showed the balance as 0.0btc.  
  
Also my copay wallet where the original phrase came from only shows 0.03btc.

How do pass phrases work? For example, when I made my Co Pay wallet i was given a 12 word phrase (or something) that I could enter to recover the wallet should my phone fail.  
  
Right so, I installed Jaxx. Entered my phrase and now Jaxx has my bitcoin on it.  
So really my bitcoin is never on a wallet, the wallet is more like a bank app that allows me to view my coin and access it right?

It's all moved the same way, so it is a normal transaction as bitstamp/ledger are two seperate wallets. Bitstamp has no affiliation with Ledger other than an option to make it easier depositing/withdrawing.  
  
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:43:57
So I started with a CoPay wallet. I moved all my bitcoin to that and then decided I wanted a Jaxx wallet so I installed that (both iOS), and entered the pass phrase that my CoPay wallet gave me.  
  
That was probably 4 months ago now. Now when I look at my wallets they show different amounts. Why?  
CoPay shows about 0.03BTC and Jaxx is 0.5BTC  
  
They have the same transactions but the last transaction shows a different value, despite being the same day/code

I've tried mycelium and it won't recognise my seed phrase. 
  
My co pay wallet still shows .33btc and my jaxx is .65. (I bought more)

So I started with a CoPay wallet. I moved all my bitcoin to that and then decided I wanted a Jaxx wallet so I installed that (both iOS), and entered the pass phrase that my CoPay wallet gave me.  
  
That was probably 4 months ago now. Now when I look at my wallets they show different amounts. Why?  
CoPay shows about 0.03BTC and Jaxx is 0.5BTC

Hi there I was searching jaxx on the sub when I came across your profile.
I'm having an issue, my iOS jaxx app just randomly deleted my wallet the other day. I went to try and enter my seed phrase and it won't let me continue. Basically it looks like this:    
  
  
After I enter my phrase there is no button to continue, and even if I select camera it does nothing. I downloaded jaxx for desktop and recovered my wallet that way, but it looks like I'll have to switch iOS wallets.

I'm here at the moment, seen a few restaurants and hostels that say they accept bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-04-10 09:26:44
Sigh of relief? Why? What were you worried about?
@_date: 2018-04-15 04:31:41


Don't patronize someone about the security of a wallet. Some people are storing thousands of dollars on wallets, and of course that value can always go up. Security isn't something to make light of.
@_date: 2018-04-29 00:24:12
Hahaha no. This is not a valid result or answer to the theoretical position you proposed.
@_date: 2018-04-28 11:27:21


Why?  
Because they won't switch to 100% bcash...  
  
   
In what crazy world does this paragraph make any coherent point?

That's me. I've been watching bitcoin for years, I think I first told myself I should buy at $200usd. I just bought $91 worth yesterday. I'm looking at buying more but the kicker to me right now is the amount I'm being charged to actually buy it! 0.10c on the dollar to actually invest. wot.
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:37:47
I've noticed some exchanges buy/sell at vastly different rates (100usd).  
  
Whats to stop me from buying on the cheaper one, moving the BTC to the exchange with a high rate and instantly selling for more there? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:07:50
I actually did. About 5 hours before it started dropping. That's okay it's only $1000 and it will come back up, this slump means I can go buy more, for less.
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:53:35
So the other thing to go along with this that I have been wondering is then, is it better long term to be buying bitcoin in small or large amounts? or does it not matter? Is one specific amount going to be harder to move in future?  
  
Thanks for your answers! really helpful.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:08:37
Thanks for that I keep seeing references around but nowhere to understand it.  
  
So who's pushing for bigger blocks? Miners? Or is no one and it's just happening and people want to stop it?
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:38:09
Anyone want to break down this blockchain argument that is going on?  
  
All I understand so far is bigger block chains are what Satoshi wanted (The creator of bitcoin?), and the bigger/power users don't want that? I think?

Is Bitstamp not considered a wallet? Should I be moving my BTC into a wallet once the transaction is completed?  
  
 I'm getting a bit overwhelmed by how many services I'm signing up for and also the fees of buying bitcoin?  
  
@_date: 2019-05-09 06:27:40
True, I forgot US banks actually charge you money to hold your money. Still, if you're holding $100k+ then it'd be easy enough to argue for them to drop the fees if there's X amount of money there. The interest on that probably negates the fees too though

Amazon refund the same way you purchase, so if you buy on a gift card they'll just credit you account back.

My account just got verified on kraken so I went to try and fund it. How though?  
  
All the funding options are just wallet addresses so I can deposit another type of crypto currency. There doesn't seem to be anyway to deposit fiat via Credit card or bank transfer. Am I just missing it?
@_date: 2019-05-09 02:58:30
There's no reason she can't leave it in an open account in the US and pay by card/withdraw/wire smaller amounts overseas as she needs/wants it
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:13:33
It took me 7 days to get verified on Kraken. Try BitStamp if you in are in a hurry, took less than 12 hours.
@_date: 2017-06-03 10:23:01
I signed up 6 days ago and haven't been verified yet, it took Bitstamp less than 12 hours to verify me. Either they're useless or under a lot of stress from users.

Is there a "how to prepare for the fork" guide somewhere? I plan to be out of internet around the time the fork will happen so I'd like to prepare for whatever outcome prior to that.  
    
  
I understand that if the miners move to BIP148 then no one needs to do anything, however if they don't then we all want to be on the BIP148 chain, yet we *should* still also hold bitcoin on the legacy chain, so we should have bitcoin on both, right? But how?  
  
How will my wallet know I have coin on both, or how will my bitcoin be transferred to the new BIP148 chain? I use a CoPay wallet and Bitstamp exchange. (I also signed up for Kraken but it's been 5 days and they haven't verified me)  
Is the market expected to get extremely volatile around this time?
