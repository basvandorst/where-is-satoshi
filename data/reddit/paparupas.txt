Thanks. I wish I learned that lesson with a 2 digit number of loss instead of that

At this link, OP finally says:
"Looking at my account again today, the SENT transactions are all gone. Its probably a maintenance/update on their site that temporarily showed those transactions. I guess my account is OK. "
Awwww COME ON BE IT LIKE THIS WITH MY CASE TOO!
I'll come here and spend 50 bucks with you if I get the BTC back

0.09 BTC. Can't we follow the address to see wo which platform they went?

1. Νο
2. Νο. Unique strong passcode
Email authorisation never came in at this transaction!!! And I hadn't logged in since 2 days before.

Thanks for the advice but,
I mostly made this post to learn 
1 how is it possible for them to remotely login and make the transfer without email authorisation and no alarms (BTW I don't have mobile number /2 step authorisation. I just have strong password &amp; email auth)
and 
2 to get informed if someone has ever won a case or something. If I prove my account was hacked, do I have the right for a reimbursement from Blockchain?

I always fall for this but it never gets old.
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:59:35
I know it sounds silly, but I'm just a newbie and I'm not sure if there's a possibility this is a platform's glitch?
Because I see no email authorisation request the date the transaction happened (11th). And I had last logged in on 8th...
