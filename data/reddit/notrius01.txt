They have only 22k btc now (down from 73 or so), so it shouldn't affect btc that much. Bch on the other hand...

He knew power of currency lies in its distribution.

markets are a tool to move money from impatient pockets to the patient ones.

No we didn't. John Oliver being hated by every Trumpster doesn't mean he wasn't right vast majority of time.

The problem is Roger Ver a) attacks bitcoin all the time b) has full power over bch/bch mining c) is rich as fuck and positions himself as leader therefore we should have higher requirements on him (think of Charlie Lee).

well yeah english is not my first language but you understood the meaning. You can't have something planned and be it "panic" at the same time.

oh fan on T_D right?

Very good reply!

There are videos on yt discussing that with direct examples of his behaviour. I'm sure you can find it.

You don't understand trading that's all. There is a difference between trading and hodling you know.

try doug polk video on him.

Damn good that it wasn't presented as "technical analysis" as it has nothing to do with it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:34:28
pre-planned panic sell is an oxymoron that contradicts itself. You can't have something planned and be it "panic activity" at the same time. You seem not to understand the difference between trading and hodling (aka believing), traders ALWAYS calculate losses first, because everything else comes down to it (like expectancy of your trading system and so on). 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:46:44
No you don't and you apparently never traded any other (liquid) market without physical delivery. Stop Loss is the most important thing for any trader (just ask fx/futures traders). Buying with intention of hodling is investing, NOT trading.

Big whales want to buy and they need liquidity which in crypto world can be achieved ONLY via panic selling/buying.

for every paper saying that, you can find others saying the opposite, e.g TA can give you an edge on certain markets.
@_date: 2018-04-10 11:07:06
those are mostly TA wannabies. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 10:49:13
There is very little real TA in crypto market and it has nothing to do with bears. It is, as someone pointed out elsewhere on reddit, more of a stop loss hunt by margin exchanges.

The end of fiat is far far away. Don't be fooled, btc and co is awesome but we must be realistic.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:28:37
best is to wait till the dump is over and then start buying.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:05:27
That's incomparable. That's like saying you always die in a car because someone died in Daewoo Tico (look it up if you don't know what it is). Talking about "end of fiat around the world" is just a wet dream, not to mention there are some macroeconomic issues which can't be solved with crypto currencies. Cryptocurrencies are good at something but they can't replace the current financial system, yet.
