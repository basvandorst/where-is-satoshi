So like 4 years ago I bought 0.4~ bitcoin on coinbase. I then transferred it.. somewhere, but I don't remember where or what account was used then. When I go on coinbase I get a "transfer code", but it's basically just random digits and jargon that doesn't help much.
Is there a way to find out where it went? Would certainly help to get $6000 before the holidays

Yeah. It was a hassle, but I did guess it eventually.
GOOD comeback !!! 
You talk like an old woman trying her best to be snarky and 'badass' on facebook, jesus

Oh boo hoo, do you get off on the mild inconveniences of other people or something? Do you need to feel like you're impressing me and everyone else by being "Above such foolish things as forgetting an account name"? I made a $50 purchase 4 years ago and forgot the account I put it in. I have a lot of accounts, many of which I end up not using after a while for this or that reason. 
I say "Well this is unfortunate, maybe I'll see if I can rely on the kindness of strangers to help me out". And you know, I did get the kindness of some strangers giving me some genuine advice. So why do you have to be the twat sitting around saying "Wow guess you should have REMEMBERED, IDIOT" as if that's not why I'm here in the first place? Are you such a boring person in real life?

He started the attitude. I handed it back. Don't now pretend you're some defender of the innocent or whatever to cover your tail the moment someone tells you how you're acting. You just sound washed up.

Yeah no you're right, because no other websites have multitudes of recovery systems for account security and recovery. Especially not websites for systems designed to be used by mass amounts of people. It's just me and by big retard head who is at fault here. I should make sure to tattoo every financial transaction of $50 on my forehead so I don't look like a fool online years later. You are a true paragon of practical thinking and wit.

Dang. Not the most intuitive system.
