Next stop, 3 figures!

Too much breathing.  Youve caused bitcoin to fall sharply by $400.  Youre the reason foe the near sub 10k price.
(All figures accurate at time of posting)

Congrats, you just managed to increase the price of bitcoin $100
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:48:45
I correlate bitcoin dips with breathing.

Just in time for the crash to 20k

Haha I actually own 0.0012 bitcoin because someone tipped me two years ago.  Worth something like $13 now.  I just don't know how to buy / sell from New Zealand easily.
If I could hook an online wallet up to my CC I might look at throwing a grand on today!

Agree whole heartedly.
As the phenomenal rise of bitcoin to $20k, no-one would ever dare dreaming of spending it (I could pay 1 bitcoin today or half a bitcoin tomorrow).  As it comes back down, people do want to spend.  (I could pay 1 bitcoin today, or two bitcoin tomorrow).
What you really want to see is stability.  Which isn't going to happen with speculators.  However as it becomes more mainstream stability will occur and people will be content to spend rather than expecting capital gains and speculating.
I've sat on the sideline, but I'm quite tempted to buy if it goes much lower.  I believe it's still over valued though.

I don't know how you fools hold your shit.  I've got no money invested in this and I've been doing no work this afternoon intrigued as to where it will go.

I have won and lost thousands in poker.  Lost a grand in a home game once.  Won 1600 at the casino.
I understand how having money in the game changes things, I'm just finding this so intense not having cash in the game I don't see how people with thousands are riding these incredible waves.

It's not exactly up if you brought in at 1k.
It IS up however, if you brought 12 months ago.  Whether it will be up in 12 months, I don't know.  I've enjoyed coming in and reading about these crashes every few months.  Then dreaming about what would have happened if I'd dropped a grand when they were $50 like I was half tempted to do.
Just too much gambling for me, and I enjoy a bit of poker.

I wad up late (as a kiwi) watching sports last night and the price dropped from 130 to 55 and then rebounded.  I would hardly say that its a complete recovery when fluctuations like that are occuring in a 25 hour period.  Its a complete rollercoaster ride right now.

That's like saying don't like facebook use one of the alternatives no one else seriously uses.  Ad its the largest, people flock to it because of the volume of trades.  Why would I use Google plus when none of my friends do?
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:25:47
So how were those predictions of yours turning out?
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:37:59
Your balls are much bigger than mine, that's for sure haha.  Its a rush just reading about it.

Thanks for this, I've been struggling to understand bitcoins, as I only heard about them a week or two back and understood this to be an "Alternative currency".
The problem I'm seeing though, is people are buying these things, sending the price of them up, only to sell them to someone who's willing to pay more.
Who's actually spending?!?  It's just a buy/sell market at the moment, which seems incredibly pointless if theres no actual value to them :/
