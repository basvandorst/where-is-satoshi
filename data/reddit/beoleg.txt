And yet, it happens again

I wish I had that much liquid.
Nevertheless I will pay every last cent to the clients if uphold ends up stealing the money permanently.

Money laundering is converting cash to crypto.
Not the other way around...
Not to mention that our company does not transact in fiat at all!
I also care a lot about preventing money laundering, believe me!
Now based on that, would you mind if I hold on to 165 of your Bitcoins (actually more since there are more trades involved)

While I accept your position, partnerships are at the core of every business, from college to SNP500
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:20:50
We are talking about crypto transactions only here, right?
Does Blockchain.info block your Bitcoins asking for Documents?
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:40:04
Done it already... 2 years ago... that’s what’s so ridiculous about this situation.
I hold a fully verified and non-restricted account with them, with no limit on crypto transactions according to their own terms.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:41:29
This is a lie, I had and still have a business account with you, verified according to all requirements.
It was only when the 165 BTC deposit arrived that you removed my verification status claiming that ‘this is a standard procedure that occurs every year’ (despite the fact the BUSINESS account has been verified for 2 years with no problems).
To my request to provide a full list of requirements for releasing the funds there was no response whatsoever.
I will be more than happy to release the correspondence to the domain of the public, if you would be as happy as I am.
You are simply stalling!
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:09:28
Exactly as we do not! (Do fiat nor hold balances)
The trade in question was BTC to ETH!
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:48:11
This is incorrect, our use-case was by all means communicated and transparent to uphold.
We have even invited the uphold team, in writing, to our WebSummit stand.
This is the reason why when asked for clarification I stated immediately that those are customer funds and indicated the transaction ID on my system.
Of course, in Rome you must be Roman, do not expect any credit for being transparent nor for telling the truth.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:51:13
The OP had since then sent 5 emails over the course of the last 24 hours to your team, none of them got any response for you.
I have also suggested numerous times to make a phone call to clear things out and works towards a resolution, those were all ignored.
I did have a fully approved business account with Uphold, and any attempt to deny it is a blunt lie.
I have correspondences with both the support and technical personal to prove it, as well as 'official' Uphold emails confirming my verified business status.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:54:34
Our fee is 0.5% and our costs.
In case of big orders we take 0.2% as we subsidize part of the cost.
Sometimes we end up with nothing or negative margin, but I am willing to take that loss, because our long term goal is to become the first highly available and on-demand cryptocurrency A-Book Broker.
Too bad that our business partners do not share our vision as they are who are actually making money in 100% of the cases, officially up to 3% and much more by taking an interval from the market rate.  
If you review Uphold terms and conditions carefully you will see that it is stated that crypto funding and trading is unlimited.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:28:29
I also asked them to at least enable trading so I can protect my customers against market volatility, but the engineer I talked to had declined, and the actual people that froze the account (‘compliance officer’)
Is unresponsive and refuses to talk to me according to the engineer I’ve co tasted on WhatsApp!
Uphold CEO!
Show yourself!
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:16:39
I did have a business account verified, active, and used with Uphold for 2 years, with no problems.
Any attempt to deny that is a LIE.
If in your organisation the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, it is not my, neither my client's problem.
I practiced full disclosure and transparency about my business, as I do about any aspect of my life.
On the other hand, you guys, have an abnormal amount of shit floating around you in the internet, not limited to Reddit, but what can be found in Bitcoin-Yoda's references is enought by it self, if only I had found it earlier.
Uphold which waves the words 'KYC' and 'License' in fact has no license of it's own, nor ay real regulation.
Their website states that in Europe they are 'partnering' with a big FCA (UK) regulated financial institution.
However, this institution's name remains unknown.
In the USA they claim to have a FinCEN regulation, while FinCEN is in fact is an enforcing arm of the federal government, and not a regulator!
A proper regulator would be the FSA or the SEC.
It is the same as if a drug dealer would say he is regulated by the DEA!
Uphold also keeps an operation in Braga, Portugal, by a company name Uphold LDA, the ties between Uphold LDA and Uphold INC seem unclear, however none of the latter is a regulated financial institution like they claim to be!
They use the Portugese company for cheaper work force as well as for physical money remittence (receiving money in bank wires to a bank in Portugal), all without any license.
I have contracted an investigating journalist as well as a lawyer to look deeper into those matters, let's see what they can dig up.
So, to conclude, unlike what Uphold claims, I do comply with all laws and regulations of my jurisdiction, I do have an AML and KYC policy which I apply carefully to the relevant clients, and I do have the full documents of the client that had sent the money.
Regardless of this, he happens to also be in my inner circle, and I know that his capital is un-doubtfully clean.
To put all this aside, can you point out the exact BRITISH or any EUROPEAN law at all that requires crypto-only exchangers to obtain a license or have KYC done? or are you just making things up as we go?
Perhaps you would like to declare a war on Shapeshift and Chengelly as well, or even Kraken that allow crypto deposits and even Fiat withdrawals without uploading documents?
To conclude I would like to add a reference to all the threads that Bitcoin-Yoda was able to dig-up for us, so no potential victims miss those.

Just to prove that it is completly not true that we are not an 'Authorised company' or not a 'Partner' below is a screenshot of our partner channel in their own slack!
Clearly it is a case of the right hand not knowing what the left one is doing!
We provided KYC on all of the clients, still, the money is frozen.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:41:48
In our jurisdiction we do not need to do KYC if:
1. I am not custodial.
2. We do not transact in fiat.
Do changelly and shapshift do KYC? Or any non-custodial exchange for that matter?
Are they all outlaws? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:42:32
We use own reserves but this one was obviously out of our reserves so we’ve used uphold as a liquidity provider.
It was a mistake obviously.
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:59:05
How would you manage price discovery if there are no secondary markets?
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:13:52
1. Nobody got scammed.
It ain’t over till the fat lady sings.
2. Yes I did communicate my business needs to uphold both personally and via the application.
3. In the meeting with their chief of business development I offered them to place a badge on our site but they have refused.
We do still offer immediate settlement for uphold customers on orders for major pairs.
So we are obviously not hiding anything.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:56:49
Right, especially that most finds are owned by users.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:54:47
What do u mean?
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:53:51
When was the last time blockchain.info or Btc.com (e.g. decent vendor) froze your wallet for depositing large sums for crypto.
I tell you when, never, they simply do not do this shit.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:47:10
This is the form they've sent me
Clearly trying to keep the money for as long as possible.
I've completed it already once, but now they need to 'refresh it'
@_date: 2016-07-10 21:34:26
In Europe the situation is not better!
I have sent a deposit a month ago, it took them 2 weeks to track the money, after which they claimed it was returned, though they failed to provide any official document from a financial institution about this up until this day!
I have also applied for the tier 4 verification 2.5 months ago and when I asked, after a month, almost daily, what is going on, I was told that they have a huge queue due to halving and the employee working on my case got laid off and bla bla bla bla bla, however 2 days ago their employee messaged me asking me why I don't have tier4 yet, and offering me to initiate the process.
Also their platform is full of bugs and the support is obviously lacking!
So, to sum that up, what do we have until now:
40K somewhere on the way missing, nobody moves their ass to inquire.
No tier4 verefication.
Multiple loses of real and paper funds due to bugs in the platform and kraken not moving their asses.
STAY AWAY!!!
Edit: for the complete picture, let it be noted that the deposit was in USD via swift, EUR deposits and withdrawals, as well as crypto worked completely fine so far.
After 2 weeks of email paycash gracefully provided the swift tracking number, the money is at the corespondent bank, however they did hold it for no reason for 2 weeks, while not answering to emails.
My Tier4 application was just approved, however, the original forms were filled when EUR/BTC was around 360...
So no fraud here, but not much of an agreeable customer service either.
@_date: 2016-07-10 23:16:32
Wrote a direct letter to their bank anb CCed the representative  I was in touch with... 
Next step would be to file a fraud complaint with my bank... it is pretty bad...
