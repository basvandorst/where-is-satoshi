Won 1148 from 1704 bets seems fine, but you forget about the bet amount! You didn't take the bet amount into account on purpose, coz you know the bet amount has an influence on the roll. **The higher the bet, the higher the chance of losing. The lower the bet, the lower the chance of winning. This is where the trick comes in!** So it's not about the chance of winning. You know what I 'm talking about. Don't pretend it's fair anymore.  Time will tell. I'll post the detailed proof sooner.

of course you won't admit the scam. I tried with the FJC, keep doubling the bet amount won't cause the long losing streak, but the case is different once I bet with BTC.

The FJ team emailed me and didn't resolve this problem at all. 
Believe it or not, you'll lost everything if you play FJ Dice game, coz it's provably unfair.
Acorrding to thousands of rolls, I can clearly conclude the unfair trap behind the so called  "provably fair" system:
**The bet amount has an influence on the outcome. The higher the bet, more likely you lose.** 
Forward this to your family and friends, don't play on Fortunejack anymore!
The same problem happened on one of my friends.  [  This is the link to his bets history, you'll see the losing streak happened once he kept doubling the bet amount, untill he lose everything.

FJ dice game is now provably unfair!  
  I counted and ananysised the data, and the chart shows clearly that the higher you bet, the higher the chance you lose.   Data and chart link: 
To put it another way, the bet amount will influence the roll. 
I'll list some data here: I played with payout 1.5-1.6, win chance 66-61.87%. **The overall win chance of my lastest 2000 rolls is 65.3%,** well, this is fine. But the win chance decrease while the bet amount is doubled: 
**Bet amount 0.001, win chance 65.5% (&gt;65.3%)**
**Bet amount 0.002, win chance 66.8% (&gt;65.3%),**
**---here is where the trick comes in---**
**Bet amount 0.004, win chance 65.0% (&lt;65.3%),**
**Bet amount 0.008, win chance 63.4% (&lt;65.3%),**
**Bet amount 0.032, win chance 64.3% (&lt;65.3%),**
**Bet amount 0.064, win chance 55.6% (&lt;65.3%).**
See? The higher the bet, the lower the win chance! We can see clearly the trend from 2000 rolls, the trend will be more clearer if the Fortunejack team can provide all my history.
