Did you find out yet?

How on earth can this be relevant to blocksizes?
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:12:17
Interested for answers

Do you know which the cheaper options are?

I won't recommend Exodus, since it charges 4 dollar transaction fees which you have no control over.

That does sound paranoid as fuck :')
@_date: 2017-06-28 19:28:06
So 4$ is quite a lot, right?

But if I send bitcoin to my friend and he gives me a beer for it, it is impossible to track that.
Sorry but I just can't get my mind around how on earth this would be banned. I believe the whole point of bitcoin is to make it an unstoppable machine. The government probably would have "tried" to ban it years ago when everyone knew that bitcoin was only used to buy illigal drugs and weapons from Silkroad.

I totally feel you, the Exodus wallet charges 4$ dollar fee's no matter what kind of transaction.
@_date: 2017-06-28 19:43:54
It was the standard, didn't matter if you wanted to transfer 20 cents or 100 dollar.
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:43:20
What did they do and how did you find them?
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:58:19
What do you mean with your BTC-USD ability? 
You can't turn your btc into real money?

I made an account on it yesterday, but messages like this discourage me from using it.
Did you message/call their support lines?
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:14:24
How can they ban it is the first question.
