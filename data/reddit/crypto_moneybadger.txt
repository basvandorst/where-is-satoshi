Nope, I sure don't lol
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:35:15
For sure. Unless you have a good chunk it's not worth trying to catch the swings. I don't have allot, but I have an amount that it's worth it. I pay .25% of the fiat to buy or sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:54:48
All I know is it's crazy enough that I pulled out of BTC. I don't back BCH so I'm just holding in fiat for now. I am hanging on to my Monero. 
How long do you think until the South Koreans will stop pumping BCH so BTC can right again? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:32:43
Trading on the exchange is just fine, only inbound and outbound BTC xfers are affected. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:58:40
There are LOTS of us with multiple citizenships don't forget....
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:50:59
What this says. Matter of fact, in 2hrs 19mins from this post, BCH mining difficulty will increase 400%. Better buy every ounce of BTC you can right now! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:11:30
It will pick up past $8K on the 19th or 20th since Nov 20th they are starting their "tests"
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:53:41
This is so true. I support my mother overseas and my bank charges US$45 to send, then her bank charges US$25 to receive! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:17:18
As specific to the dollar amount as they predicted, I had a gut feeling something was up after 2 decades of investing. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:52:50
Screw that, people should have sold between $7,700-$7,800 when we saw it starting to happen again. BUT THE DIP! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:24:35
BTC us $10,750 USD on Golix as I type this. 
I'm going to try signing up, move BTC, sell it, and wire the fiat back into my bank account. Think it will work? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:24:32
I think you should probably read up on everything happening in the crypto world right now then make an informed decision on your own. Otherwise, you would already know the answer to this. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:26:33
The projected BTC mining adjustment is a NEGATIVE 1.93%.
Keep calm and HODL on.  
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:56:38
Not so much. I haven't read a lot of negative comments online about GDAX nearly as much as their parent product Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:00:02
Yeah, there will be a huge flood of confirmations once all the miners switch back over to BTC and the network is cleared up. Just hang tight. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:08:48
100% of every spare fiat dollar I have, but I don't have much compared to some. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:24:24
I think I figured it out. A group of miners are supporting BCH because of the scalability of blocks which will allow them centralized control through consolidation of hashing power, which only increases as the block size does. BTC restricts the blocks so decentralization among miners can still be a thing.
This is not good. The public perception is going to be like WTF and large projects like the CME may back out.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:40:56
Are you saying you're in the US then? lol. Drinking age is 18 most everywhere else. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:21:26
So if that dropped off yesterday, why is BCH still running up for a pump and dump and not started dumping yet? I know the second it does, BTC will sky rocket.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:07:16
You and me both, but I'm in on everything I have. I'll be wiped out if BTC bombs now, but I'm keeping it in an exchange with a stop-loss sell order to cover my ass. 
The variables here are BTG going live today (even tho it forked on Oct 25th I think), how longer it takes for all the miners to switch back, and how all of the backlogged transactions pan out. But hang in there. 
BTW, here is the countdown: 
Don't ever buy on someone else's advice without doing your own research to fact-check. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:59:00
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:34:22
LOL, this totally
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:46:29
WTF are you talking about? Lol.
BTC is the real Bitcoin. There is no such coin s BCC. Freakin troll.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:19:37
^^This. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:00:30
Sure, which is why the US, South Korea, and other countries regulate it as a commodity like gold. 
At the same time, as the value stabilizes and BTC is more mainstream, more places will accept it and more people will be using it as a currency. 
Other cryptos like Monero will be more used a proper currency I believe. I think BTC will be seen more as crypto gold to most. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:58:00
I use Cryptowatch and set it for the exact exchange that I use. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:33:53
The mother fu*k it will. Are you stupid or just born retarded? 
Yeah, it's a bad thing, but affect Bitcoin? I don't think you understand what's going on and how the internet works lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:25:06
Thanks but I much prefer Qubes. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:07:13
There will be a big correction, yes, but bear? No way. Simply because of the futures markets coming online, Japan making it a legal currency, etc. etc. the good news list goes on. Plus no more uncertainty with no fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:02:41
We'll see, I have to cash out Jan 1st or so to pay off a debt. I just hope it bounces back well the next month and a half like I think it will. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:24:06
I saw $7,990 on my exchange.
I'm HODL'ing tight! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:03:01
Nope, I think in the next 24hrs there will be a correction to $6,500 or lower. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:23:40
I'll sell the last of my BTC in January or so. I've moved to other cryptos where the return is significantly higher. Plus I personally just don't believe in BTC anymore. I'm all for Monero now, had some for months and am moving all my BTC into it. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:43:23
Sure; Tor, i2p, FreeNet, ZeroNet, GNUnet, etc. Take your pick. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:20:45
I have a BitPay just because it seemed like the only option to me here in the US. I haven't loaded anything onto it to use yet. I'll be curious what others recommened for US as well. 
The failing I see with BitPay is that when you transfer funds to it, they are kept in fiat so you don't get the benefit of BTC price going up, which is LAME. Makes it just another pre-paid ViSA IMO.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:35:39
HODL. We saw the low I believe at $6,420. I went ALL back in at $6,500. I believe it will only go back up at this point. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:06:02
Yeah, Goldman Sachs. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:20:48
I've read a lot of bad things about them online past week or so. Lots of users are leaving them for various issues. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:49:16
I bet $9K by Dec 1st and $10K by Dec 10th, yes. 
HODL tight my friend. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:34:57
They banned online exchanges, for now, pending regulation. Those exchanges are now trading over the counter. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:29:43
If this is true, BTC will go up 50% I bet in the 2 days of the 14th/15th prior to the fork! 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:18:25
It means it sucks. They have terrible customer service, one of the worst records of all the exchanges from what I've read everywhere for the past year or so. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:55:59
Yeah, worse than Kraken, although Kracken has been terrible just the past couple of weeks. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:27:52
Not for me at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:50:37
If you read my posts I sold at $7,800 but rebought at $6,500. Because of this fuckery I sold again at $6,399 just to bail on this crap for now. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:54:36
OP needs to just chill lol. 
It's a joke, not a dick. Don't take it so hard. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:06:17
Because I knew there would be a large crash. I wanted to lock in profits so I can better my position when the dust settles. 
While I did sell all of my BTC, I have about 1/5 of my portfolio in Monero which I've kept that I will add to as my new long-term to replace BTC. 
For the amount of money I have, BTC has gotten too valuable to outweigh the potential gain from Monero in the near-term. 
I'll buy back into BTC when I think the time is right but I'll be 50/50 BTC and Monero. I'll also be waiting for the next Monero correction before I buy more. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:41:30
I think I just figured it out. A group of miners are supporting BCH because of the scalability of blocks which will allow them centralized control through consolidation of hashing power, which only increases as the block size does. BTC restricts the blocks so decentralization among miners can still be a thing. 
This is not good. The public perception is going to be like WTF and large projects like the CME may back out. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:21:29
I plan on buying back when it corrects into the $6Ks, which I just hope it will. 
Of course it's a gamble. For all I knew, this could have been the big one and crashed into the $3K, who knows. I do what I want when I want. It's as much intuition as luck. 
You are debating as if things are predictable lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:01:51
"There is no way that the universe will allow me to cash out a millionaire"
LMFAO! It's coming but not in the next 1/2 hr lol
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:48:57
I sold all my BTC for fiat at $6,399 and just took the loss. Not sure what kind of nerd money game is being played, but there is one afoot. I'm out. 
I have a fair Monero investment I'll hang on to, but this petty "I'm the real Bitcoin" nonsense has me totally over this crap. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:15:44
OP = Captain Obvious
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:24:41
Ok but then what do you plan on doing OP? Are you going to wait for an expensive wire transfer to put the fiat back into your bank account then do another ACH into Coinbase, rinse then repeat? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:28:27
Better late than never I guess lol 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:07:58
For US users I'd suggest Gemini. Coinbase blows chunks and for a US person, there aren't any better alternatives that I know of. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:31:52
I agree and we need to have an open voice with Bitcoin.org to know what the devs have in mind. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:58:59
Lol, nice analogy 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:05:32
Heck yes
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:40:47
Considering at the beginning of the week Goldman Sachs made a prediction to their investors on BTC and we hit within only $7 of that. I'd say YES! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:06:14
Yeah, come next week I'm curious if there will be any announcements of big players like the CME backing away from BTC. That's what has me freaked out. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:39:55
Yup. The next 2-3 hours are going to be critical. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:26:44
^^This, Guess the OP has never heard of the Rothschild family lol.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:01:51
Not really, I just got lucky watching the peak live plus I had 2-day notice thanks to Goldman Sachs of what the peak would be. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:10:28
The average Joe should be!! Problem is in the West, power is more expensive so mining equipment+electrical bill makes it not profitable. That's why the Asian corporate miners own the show now. 
This brings home the point of why everyone should be running a full node and mining just for the health of the network to mitigate this in the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:19:24
What does the age of my username matter? You think it's the only one I've ever had here lol
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:46:55
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:31:57
Just wait, it will go way lower, then buy.
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:14:54
^^This. Just sit tight and we'll see. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:50:50
^^^THAT is freakin hilarious lol
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:44:05
They have turned down other futures exchanges in the US. But I would think that the CME must be working on a special framework with the SEC, otherwise, they wouldn't have announced it's coming. They would know better than to jump the gun. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:50:31
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:28:09
I think we have another 5-6 months. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:58:18
You suck at reading lol. I never said I didn't want to discuss, I asked WTF you are talking about. Like what does TreamCoin even mean? 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:44:13
Well, it went to $7,450 and will be dipping allot lower later, don't know what to tell ya. Remember, what you see on 1 exchange is a fraction of the big picture. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:16:52
Yup! Also, don't forget the BCH dump will happen over lots of mini dump and pumps. It's going to be a roller coaster. 
Also here is the link to BTG value 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:35:14
Don't forget South Korea.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:37:25
I fuckin love this crazy old bastard, seriously lol. He's the whack job that should be our US pres haha!
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:14:17
Buy like a crazy mofo until Nov 16th! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:45:42
Of course. You think AOL and Netscape still rule the internet? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:52:59
Good luck. Most like CoinDesk are biased because they are owned by companies involved with crypto-coin projects of their own. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:44:23
I used to do a lot of stock trading back after high school but totally lost my ass, $20K, my entire savings at the time. It took Bitcoin to get me back into it a bit. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:33:40
I've increased my wealth 31% since Sept 9th through today when I sold at $7,800. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:10:17
Lol, the old sheep in the headlights denial stage. I was there yesterday and all the way through last night myself. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:08:25
What? Lol. Just sell the BTC for fiat then xfer to your account. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:44:30
Hardly anyone cares about it or knows about Tether. I didn't have any and no one I know did either. Just not a big deal. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:19:10
Hell fuckin yeah, I went all back into BTC this morning. Time for the fuckin BCH pump and dump to begin Act 2. 
Here is the link for everyone 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:44:56
The low was $6,420
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:23:33
Lol, it's not to the minute. I only hope you went all in when BTC was in the $6,0xx or cheaper this morning. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:29:52
50/50 on Bitcoin and Monero
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:06:21
Literally, ALL current forms of encryption will be rendered inadequate. The only thing stopping that right now is writing the code to allow using the quantum CPU for that purpose. I suspect the US government and others formed partnerships with DWAVE, MS, etc. to work on starting this a few years ago. Huge advancements have been made the past couple years on the number of q-bits and the programming language. It's only a matter of time. We would need quantum encryption to counter this. 
BTW, what are you calling "smart grid"? IoT? Far as hacking IIoT/ICS, yeah, that's currently a thing already for the past 15 years. That's my professional field of expertise. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:23:50
Lol. Dude I see that happen like once a week on Gemini, nothing new. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:27:11
Don't know about their customer service but aside from them running out of BCH, last week, I've never had a problem. I use them to change BTC to XMR all the time. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:42:38
All of it lol.
No worries tho, with the futures markets coming online, Japan legalizing, China trading over the counter, things are looking good in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:32:40
Good stuff, right on! I put about 13,000 a year on my muscle car that's my daily driver. Wouldn't change it for the world. New cars just don't make sense to me when you can have old ones that are as reliable, efficient, and comfortable. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:43:06
I panic sold everything at $7,800 lol
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:51:47
Hell yeah, we just saw the lowest BTC value ($6,701) this morning. With CME and all the other good news in the pipeline, it's nothing but up up up. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:49:25
Hell fucking no it isn't! Buy the big dip this weekend, NOT right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:10:00
Be sure to report back, please. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:23:28
The most well-planned series of pump and dumps ever lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:42:43
Hell yeah, I sold high again and plan on buying low this weekend. Make daddy some more free money!!!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:01:47
THIS. Buy the dip then hang on. CME begins their "testing" on the 20th which is going to get more people excited. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:22:06
Nope, it will go down to $6,500 or less. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:33:02
Unless his car (which is a depreciating asset most likely) is paid off and his house too, I don't think you understand what net worth means. Fiat currency is also a depreciating. Smart people don't keep their net worth (=wealth) in depreciating assets. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:58:16
Do you have a link to this info? At what block will the fork occur? What are the technical details of the fork? 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:03:41
Spot on. I was in a meeting at work and couldn't sell until $7,700. I'll be buying this next dip again. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:10:14
You're 8 hours too late but correct. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:49:44
THE all time high of $6,910 (on the exchange I use anyway), so far anyway as of the timestamp on this post lol.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:47:39
Yeah, I bailed on BTC and took the loss while I could still afford it. At this point at least I made more than I lost. No way I'm going to buy BCH when it's such an obvious pump and dump in progress. I'm hanging onto my Monero and keeping my BTC in fiat for now. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:30:23
Been reading for 2-3 weeks about Kraken being fucked. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:27:08
Awesome, smart move! I own all mine too, I enjoy old cars that appreciate in value and that I can enjoy personally. Probably won't sell any for another 30 years. You a car guy too? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:09:22
Negative on the privacy, that's what Monero is for. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:54:42
I've mined and held  BTC since early 2013. Only in the past 4 months have I been doing some trading to take advantage of the volatility. I managed to sell all my BTC at $7,800. Just between Sept. and the ATH I increased my wealth by 31%. I started stock trading back in 1998. I have only ever been in the red in terms of capital 2 times ever in crypto. Usually it's only my gains that fluctuate. 
Funny thing is I had a limit buy order set for $5,500 last night but cancelled it, went out for a drink and missed it. I went all back in early this morning at $6,272. My fault is I ALWAYS second guess my first instinct. Should have kept the limit buy order for $5,500 and not cancelled it thinking it would go lower and that I could catch it. 
Even still, I expect to see some awesome gains the next 2-3 days. Also from my Monero that I've held since buying at $95. 
Everyone should be buying BTC and holding right this second. Its @ $6,019.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:23:07
Absolutely. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:38:22
Not true at all. If I can leverage it in a way to better my position so I own more and more coin, then it's certainly worth it. It takes more money to make more money. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:39:49
Only China at this point, Japan and South Korea opened a little while ago.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:44:12
Hardly, it was below $7,000 just this morning lol
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:09:43
I'm at work and can't watch video. Care to post a summary? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:51:38
Anything under $6K is a great buy in price IMO. I bought all back in at $6,272 after selling at $7,800.
I've been watching my Monero investment too, if it hits $150 again I'm going to sell that and move it all into BTC. Once BTC peaks on the CME and other stuff going on, I'll look to buy back into Monero at a lower price. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:23:21
Nice. I sold at $7,800 and posted several times here the day before yesterday I thought the floor would be $6,500 plus I indeed went all back in at that point. All up from here. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:27:51
Hmm, I typed BCC into LiveCoinWatch.com and nothing came up so I figured it was FUD. Thanks for the correction. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:21:03
Yes. Allot of people I imagine pumped it expecting free BT2. Now it will correct, then start another rise because of all the other great news for BTC in the pipe.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:48:24
I think you left off a zero lol.
Thanks for trollin, come again
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:07:09
Ok, we'll see haha
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:34:40
Be sure to keep more aside to buy the dip this weekend. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:08:48
MONERO FTW
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:33:51
Embrace it, sell high, rebuy low and better your position. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:18:29
Lol, yeah, still me, owning more coin than before. Even if just a small amount it was worth it getting lucky as all hell on my timing.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:53:50
Always possible, we'll see. I rebought with half of what I have at $6,750 so I'm ahead on that one. I'm still waiting to rebuy with the other half of what I have. I always try to split it up like that.......... and down she goes again haha
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:26:24
Should post there or on their Slack channel
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:34:15
Buy a GRIP low as a MoFo right now!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:50:54
What are you talking about? The BCH pump and dump is screwings things at the moment, nothing more. Just your basic market manipulation. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:22:44
Dude, max out all your credit cards to buy BTC on this weekends dip, take the cash you need, and keep the rest in to pay it all and then some when it goes back up. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:01:44
THIS. That's why I love Monero haha
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:45:19
Hell yeah, Monero is making my filthy rich haha
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:46:59
Jesus fucking Christ :facepalm:
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:02:28
2hrs and 11mins until the beginning of the dump of all dumps....
Buy your BTC NOW! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:44:20
Sure because they can make the change on the existing blockchain and not via a fork. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:38:39
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:06:39
No lol. For the record, Monero will end up second only to BTC in the coming years. Mark my words. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:56:28
2hrs 13mins until BCH block difficulty increases 400%, buy BTC strong and hang on! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:19:08
Right lol
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:58:43
I think I figured it out, I have been confused too. A group of miners are supporting BCH because of the scalability of blocks which will allow them centralized control through consolidation of hashing power, which only increases as the block size does. BTC restricts the blocks so decentralization among miners can still be a thing.
This is not good. The public perception is going to be like WTF and large projects like the CME may back out.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:21:42
This. Going to be a bumpy road, but yes it will be an uphill one. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:24:20
I don't think the OP understands the concepts of opulence and luxury. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:25:02
This guy is still alive? lol. What is he, a crypto expert now? HAHA! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:50:11
YEAH! Hope it stays there. Even my beloved Monero is kicking ass. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:21:05
They do that literally like at least once a week lol
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:51:00
I'm right there with you, I sold at $7,800 but I'm thinking it will go down to $6,500 in the next 24hrs before I re-buy.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:50:18
Negative. That's blockchain in general. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:59:20
They make their own luck. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:30:21
That sucks. A valuable lesson in OpSec for sure. I'll dox myself a bit here by saying I use Qubes OS. Look into it. Keep your wallets in sandboxed air gapped VMs that don't touch anything and stay offline. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:53:42
I can't even read it, stupid site wants me to disable my ad-blocker lol
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:22:17
Yeah, I've been there many many times myself. I'm aiming for re-buying @ $6,400 unless it keeps trending down when it gets to that point. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:48:07
Over the next 2 days while all of the pending transactions confirm, who the hell knows. I bet a lot of suckers fell for the the BCH pump and dump and have transactions pending for converting at places like ShapeShift, etc. Until their transactions confirm, they can't get out of BCH and could lose BIG time.
That said, there will be a dip, not below $5,400 I don't think, and maybe back down to $5,500 but then everything should recover.
I predict $9K by the end of the year. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:10:17
That Goldman Sachs dude called it close, I saw $7,950 on the exchange I use. They said $7,941. Like damn. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:05:25
Hell yeah, I sold high again and will buy this dip too. Ignore the HODL'ers that never improve their position, they are WAY missing out. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:50:42
Stop with the "attack" crap, embrace it, sell high and buy low. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:06:00
I would go all in this second, then bail right before the fork. Then wait a couple weeks and see where the market goes before going all back in. But at that point, I would go 50% Monero on the long term. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:58:07
I plan on it. Been watching BCH for some perspective. I'll be buying with all I have at this coming BTC low. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:46:47
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:39:27
I'd wait for all the dust to settle over the next 24-48 hours and use your educated judgement. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:04:20
I believe so. $6,420 was it. Back up now. Looks like the BCH bullshit pump and dump ran its course.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:32:33
I panic sold everything at $7,800 just in case. I'm going to sit by and watch now.
I also found it odd the price went to within $7 of the peak Goldman Sachs predicted at the beginning of the week. I had set that as my personal mark to dump everything just out of a weird feeling I had. Took me longer to log in and dump and it was down to $7,800 by the time I did.
In the long term we are fine because of all of the good news in the pipe for BTC, but who knows what it will re-correct to prior to the 1st of the futures exchanges coming online. Japan just made it a legal currency today as well. 
Meanwhile my Monero investment is seeing amazing gains finally. I'm going to buy more. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:58:01
BCH might get a pump before the mining switch, but BTC will be the one skyrocketing in the coming hours/days
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:41:47
Let the drop go further then buy in stages in case it goes even lower than what you think it will. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:07:05
Call it WTF you want lol. An up down or a ziggi wig, same effect. Sell high, buy low. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:08:54
Hard, while BCH keeps being pumped, WTF is going on.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:16:36
Don't tell her, you NEVER know what surprises life has in store, trust me. Keep building it and if you guys are still together when you decide to retire, it will be the best news she will ever hear. 
Whatever you do, stay debt free, never pay interest on anything. Don't buy stupid depreciating assets like fancy cars. To do this come clean on some good investment decisions over the decades to come but never admit to the full picture.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:39:25
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:08:36
I sure did, I bought even more! 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:58:41
I predicted $6,500 when I sold at $7,800 and I'm all back in as of then, so hopefully not much less lol
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:36:02
Same here. I sold all my BTC at $7,800 and I'm going to sit tight for 18 hours or so. 
I'm staying all in on my Monero tho, it's having a great time right now! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:48:15
Funny thing is I had a limit buy order set for $5,500K but cancelled it last night. 2hrs later I was at the bar and I saw it went that low lol. I've rebought in all the way at this point. I think in the next now to 4 hrs we are going to see the start of a huge BTC rise that will break the previous ATH. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:49:16
I personally think it was people responding immediately to the fork being cancelled because if they could buy to pump it up, then sell at the peak before the news went mainstream and all the people who pumped in for free BT2 backed out, it's a good win. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:02:21
Same here. It's like virtual crack
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:30:49
It doesn't I see them all the time lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:26:40
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:07:03
I just wish Gemini exchange would support setting a stop-loss sell point so I can sleep at night lol. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:56:53
I am in my 30s so I may have a more traditional investing outlook than most here, plus my father was an investment banker. 
1st rule; never EVER touch your investment capital. 
2nd rule; take all capital gains and put 1/2 into growing the capital and the other 1/2 into more risky ventures.
Whatever "capital" may mean to people will vary. Some will consider BTC their capital, others a fiat currency, etc. All my capital right now is in BTC, simply because I don't have as much as most. As that changes, I'll diversify my capital into something more stable than BTC which of course also means far less return, but I'll sleep better at night.
For me, a risky venture for the other 1/2 of all my capital gains is XMR. 
Also, you should always have a *stash*. Be it savings in a bond, diamonds, gold bars under your house, etc. This is your money for a rainy day that you forget about. For some, this means 2 full years of what your living expenses are. To build this stash, I'd suggest putting that 1/2 of your capital gains towards this before growing your capital. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:47:58
That's not much. I'd say all BTC. Once you have 1BTC, then you can start putting additional into an alt like Monero.
I'm 3/4 BTC and 1/4 XMR personally. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:45:59
This ^^^. I used to use Amory way back in 2013/2014 for my BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:35:52
This is such nonsense and months old, gimmie a break.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:16:50
Yes. No matter what exchange you use, it would be wise to have your coin in a wallet where you have the private keys until the 2x (18 Nov) and Bitcoin Gold (25 Oct) forks have been implemented. JMHO. Then you can use your wallet's private wallet keys to redeem for the new forks. If you leave it in an exchange, you are at their mercy to reward you with the new alt coin you are entitled to. Plus it's just bad OpSec to store coin in an exchange unless you are an active trader, and even then, only keep what you trade in there. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:33:01
You would need to have them at some point in a wallet that supported a transaction on the new fork. Most of the big wallets will add the support immediately or relatively soon after the fork. Keep in mind this may not be permanent wallet support, but just support for their users to claim their new coin using their private keys to make the transaction.
Next, you need to either move the forked coin through say ShapeShift.io to get them into a currency that your favourite exchange supports, then sell them, or move them straight to an exchange that supports the new forked coin themselves. 
Far as doing all this safely.... I use Qubes OS so I can make AppVMs that are clean, use them, then destroy them so there is no trace after using a shredder on the HD space. Also use full HD encryption, a VPN, and do it over Tor if you can. Do it over a hardwired connection. Use multiple wallet addresses, etc. With that much, I hope you have very good OpSec or a trusted professional as a friend who does. 
I also wouldn't do a damn thing until the wallet you decide to use gives their users a step by step to avoid replay. In other words, consider it NOT safe at all to do anything until you can do it and not worry about replay. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:51:51
Everything has been moving to Monero for months. Soon nobody will use Bitcoins for illegal activities. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:17:01
Well, there are 2 ways; first is to initiate a transaction on the new chain using your private keys. or second, Electrum will most likely provide an update to the wallet that will allow you to do this exact thing but it will be simplified for basic users. Exodus and most all other wallets will be doing the same. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:43:46
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:55:32
So what I tend to do is sell high and buy low with 1/4 of my BTC portfolio at a time. I don't try to predict and take huge gains, instead, I go for only about a $200 swing in BTC value. Which I get lucky on this sometimes 2 or 3 times a day, sometimes once or twice a week. 
If you do this, you are only risking 1/4 of your investment, and who cares if you have to buy back at a higher value. The fact is if you can make several hundred a week doing this, you have more buying power with your profit. 
Granted this strategy takes a fair chunk of change, like say 4BTC, that way each 1/4 you are risking is worth it to make say $160 on a small swing after buy and sell fees. 
Sometimes it's best to just HODL, other times it's smart to trade. But above all, don't try to predict large swings and be patient. The only times I have ever screwed myself was due to those 2 factors. Now I've learned to chill the fuck out lol.
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:03:28
Lol, both duh haha.
A good example is real estate. For the most part, it doesn't increase in intrinsic value, the dollar is devaluing. Sure things like a good development near your property will help it increase, but that's not the rule its the exception. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:57:28
Lol. Some company should be selling a Bitcoin magic 8 ball on Amazon or something to capitalize on this haha! 
I'd say the chances of it dropping below $6K one more time are good but that could be today, tomorrow, or the day after. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:08:01
I think it just hot bottom at 5,464 but who knows, could go down some more. I would just buy right now, even if it goes down, it will go back up. 
In a few days after the market has recovered from BTG shit is going to set new records highs in anticipation of the Nov 16th fork. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:39:28
Here comes $7K by the middle of next week haha! Buy everyone buy, with every penny you have! 
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:36:07
As of now, it looks like Exodus is not on that list so users should be safe. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:56:48
Welcome to yesterday. Thanks for the repeat thread lol
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:53:08
Ha, I check like every hour I'm awake at least. I feel like I have a slight gambling addiction at this point lol. 
I check BTC and XMR religiously, maybe because I worship them? LOL
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:37:43
Even if it does crash, so what. Sell it when it takes more of a dive than you are comfortable with. 
Everything comes to an end, everything. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:59:20
It's a BCH shill r/ far as I'm concerned. Can't stand it. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:30:13
Sounds similar to what used to be called buying on a draw in the stock market. Where say you want to buy $1,000 in stock and you borrow $500 of that on a draw. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:20:46
Nah, just do it, not a big deal if you do it right now. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:39:35
Exodus is safe for now. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:52:20
From all that I've read, DPRK has been converting allot of their stolen BTC into XMR. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:05:35
Not really, your private keys from your Electrum wallet do the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:32:21
Lol, true. But that additional value will only be able to come from speculation on the % which is zombie. Hence why I thought it was an interesting question to see what % others think. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:22:32
Hell no, it's all about MONERO - XMR haha
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:57:37
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:34:52
Gemini is absent from that list as well, very large US exchange. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:23:54
You trolling or what? lol. Of course you don't sell now, you missed that point when it was higher. Now you buy buy buy. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:19:35
Screw that, I just freakin bought more hahahaha! 
I don't see the Gold fork as a big deal at all and I'm just going to HODL. I will be selling right before the SW2x fork tho. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:45:47
This question is so ridiculous I don't even know how to respond seriously lol. You need to learn more about BTC mining.
Now an XMR miner, a little bit, only because it's made to be mined via a CPU and not require a GPU/ASIC setup. But still, you would have to infect tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of phones lol. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:25:55
That article is stupid on a number of levels. First, the FBI should be doing those sorts of investigations. Second, the FBI can use portions of the coins they confiscate in cases, run them thru a mixer, then use those for this purpose. 
Why a Sheriff's department is doing this is beyond me. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:18:48
Lol, you need way more than that. Remember, as the value increase, the more you need invested to earn a decent return. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:22:59
Bitcoin is NOT anonymous. Every single transaction ever can be traced to and from. Even if you buy it, say in person using no ID, every transaction you EVER make will be on record. 
I think you are looking for Monero lol. With Monero, the transaction hashes are obscured. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:48:10
Nope. I'm not a shareholder and of course, they won't announce accepting BTC. It's just not the place for it. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:22:11
Are you posting this 2 years later just to prove what an idiot the writer was? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:32:20
Not always true at all. I send from Gemini to ShapeShift all the time to get XMR with BTC. Never a problem. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:18:29
If you have access to your private keys. You will need those to initiate the transaction to receive your forked coins.
