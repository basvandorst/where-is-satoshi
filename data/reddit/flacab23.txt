@_date: 2018-01-11 23:14:26
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:34:22
Wait we can buy hooter coin? Lol
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:41:58
Are we really having a whole conversation on how to make your phone not rotate, so it looks like you’re not losing all of your money right now? LOL
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:43:17
Thank you
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:48:07
They are opening up to new accounts again FYI
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:21:04
You have the eyes of a milkman 
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:57:21
So bitcoin was not popular when it was cheap either and it’s still slow. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:56:20
Could say the same thing when people bought bitcoin under a dollar. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:22:53
Means up
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:05:40
Tell him to make it golf cart friendly, so I can drive over from Dunedin. Lol, oh and BTC 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:18:25
I’m going to watch the Note Book with my girl. 
She will think that I’m being romantic, but all I’m doing is adding my shitty day the proper way with a movie that makes me want to blow my brains out watching
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:25:43
Won’t it be backordered like them though?
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:54:57
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:49:38
Just like China when the stock is crashing they have a master switch that shit everything down. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:01:36
Btc says 30 mins on Coinbase. Could be longer sometimes. Always send $1 first then when sent do the rest. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:07:40
What is LN? Sorry new and reading everything I can. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:47:14
Thank you. Still trying to learn all this. How fast is it to
Transfer from wallet to bittrex etc?
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:48:10
Bitcoin is a sleeping lion right now. These other coins keep nipping at him and when he wakes he will tear apart and kill everyone around him. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:16:49
Just dipped .00000000542, never mind back.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:59
Where to keep?
@_date: 2018-09-02 16:27:21
Sell any petro you have quick lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:41:38
Dunedin causeway also. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:30
Shit, last time they did this we had a small bubble and people lost millions of dollars, because they could not sell.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:36:57
Emc2 was yesterday I believe. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:00:58
If you woke up tomorrow and it was gone would it ruin your life? Everyone says there’s going to be another correction the last one was 10% and then it shut up from 10,000 to over 13,000
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:23:34
I making a joke saying they need all that money for one loaf of bread because of inflation, like it used to be in Russia when they would take a wheel barrel of money down to the local market to get a loaf of bread
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:36:08
Turn that 90 degrees and you are right. We are rocketing a straight line between 13-14K
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:13:42
Thank you very much. And thank you for not getting upset or blasting me for asking a question being a newbie LOL. Trying to read everything that I can so I’m not out of loop
@_date: 2018-09-05 08:53:22
Looks like they are going to the store to buy bread. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:42:21
Better off searching the trash at google and Apple lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:15:22
Just had a dip. Went down .000000253, wait it’s back up. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:05:36
Oh I’m good, I’m holding. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:40:35
Where did you get those lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:29:28
It will go through a correction, but I don’t see dropping that far. Especially with the market getting involved in the next two weeks. They can’t sell futures if it takes a major dive right before that
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:03:29
I know they added a new bill, they want people to believe that before it cost $6 million to buy something and now it only cost 60. Tell me how that’s ever worked in economics. I don’t walk around with the American dollar saying there’s one dollar is now worth $1000 because I said so and have nothing to back it up. Even though the American dollar is not back by anything anymore LOL. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:37:11
I hope they turn it around, because no one should have to live like that.
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:56:12
So was the home-based personal computer. How did that work out?
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:37:24
Would you like to make a bet, that you will eat your own dick if you are wrong like McCaffrey?
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:54:39
That bad?
@_date: 2018-08-29 13:10:27
Not very smart LOL the car is the worst investment you could ever purchase.
@_date: 2018-10-05 22:12:08
Lol we will agree to disagree. Works for me and never had to format my MacBook. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:04:02
Not when it’s on the left hand. Hand doesn’t hit when you lift you wrist. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:05:25
Lol Irish. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 22:31:55
I’m left handed so knob on left is better. Don’t press when hand lifts up. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 22:38:34
I watched a video that showed benefits of this set up, been working. Thank you
@_date: 2018-10-05 23:36:55
Tuned eco-boost. Truck of a workman lol. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 20:59:28
Actually watch was free so I can spend more time looking at how much money I lost on crypto this year lol. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 21:49:24
What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-10-05 21:29:10
New faces for new Apple Watch. Stock app
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:05:04
We do have plausible thumbs LOL. It’s actually really easy to use
@_date: 2018-10-05 22:31:06
87 degrees out in Florida today. Cold front lol. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 22:33:26
I did thank you. Wasn’t upset. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 21:32:17
Company pays for it. Last year I used reward points and only paid $65 for a Apple Watch and sold for $280 last week. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:03:07
For real lol 
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:46:35
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:41:07
So I’m guessing wait till tomorrow to buy lol
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:15:18
Agree. Glad I waited. Just dropped another $100 in 5 mins. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:37:54
I bought today at 5700 and got lucky, because coin base kicked back the transaction. I guess my banking account information wasn’t up-to-date. Went down to 5250 right afterwards LOL. Good thing because I bought a whole coin
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:59:17
Get a girlfriend dude, you are ruining it for all of us lol. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:44:56
LOL are you the bad luck bear? Like when you walk in from the other room on the football game and your team throws an interception and when you leave and they better?
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:16:05
Advice taken thank you. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:48:18
I have a friend like that. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:18:51
If that’s the case, we should sell at the same time and buy back when it’s zero lol. So I’m guessing you sold all of yours?
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:34:41
Now I’m doing all the reading and thinking I might wait until tomorrow even though it’s probably a mistake. I’m guessing this hash wars are going to get a little worse tomorrow
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:44:24
More like: 6 miles, 5 miles, 5.25 miles, 4 miles....
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:15:42
No way I’m believing this is still whales selling off, because it’s not like billions of dollars disappearing at once it’s millions of little teeny hundred dollar ones that are killing us. More like a computer program telling the bots to crash everything
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:27:10
If went to $3K wtf HODL now? Sell high, buy low. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 21:50:07
Making a joke because of large correction. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:37:57
The same people that said Bitcoin was going to be $25,000 today? Stock market drop 10% after going up 6000 points. Crypto currency is 10 times more volatile than the stock market. The good news is you can make 100 to 1000 times the money. The stock market is like marrying a nice white girl that has a crazy moment every once a while. Crypto currency is like marrying a Latin woman and moving her Latin family into your house. The sex will be 10 times as good, but so are they crazy.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:46:46
I always wonder places excepting bitcoin, if they except Bitcoin‘s when they are dipping? What company wants to except something knowing tomorrow it might have gone down 20%. And not all companies can hold Bitcoin for a year, if they have to Hey there employees weekly
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:28:53
Yeah I keep doing that, but it’s not fun when you never know if it’s going to drop tomorrow down to $7600 when you thought the Lowe’s that $8500 LOL
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:39:23
I did buy more on the dip at $9800 FML.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:09:27
Please tell me we are still not dealing with futures manipulating market? If they are going to have that much affect on the market, then once a month the market is going to crash
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:32:14
@_date: 2018-02-17 00:42:40
I was charged $1015 and then reimbursed for $1015, but then had two charges for $30.45 and since I can never get a hold of Coinbase, I just called my bank and they refunded me the money. I never even made a charge of $30.45 from them they just started charging me
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:05:56
Decisions decisions to buy some, or wait until crash is lower. I hate buying a coin and then watching it drop down another $500. Any idea when we think it’ll be back in the 6000?
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:34:45
So add the 0÷4 multiply it by2 subtract 26 and then I get the answer?
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:18:35
If this keeps up we won’t be at $1 million by the end of the year and I can’t wait for John McAfee have to eat his own dick. I honestly hope that it only goes up to $999,999.98. Missing two cents is because his two cents of information was worthless
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:12:33
Maybe parents could not go to work today to invest their money, because all of their kids walked out of high school on a national walk out day.
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:41:07
And a week before that 15,000. I’m not worried, I know we will be back way about that. This is the time to build up
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:31:30
Which one to buy?
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:11:46
His multiply might have been off $27K feb and we are at $6-8K
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:25:31
Hope he didn’t take Russian mofia money. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:23:13
If this is because a few truth I really hope that one of these times they lose
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:11:19
So another crash in 3...2...1 grrrrrrrrr time to buy the dip again
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:28:58
Not sure but just got an email from Coinbase saying if you got charged, it’s not our fault. Contact your bank to get refunded. If they can’t please contact us to help. Then says again, it’s not our fault lol
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:15:02
You date a Latin and you will not worry about the dips ever again lol
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:08:36
In a perfect world yes lol. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:09:17
Hello, what’s up with my rewards?
@_date: 2018-04-14 14:00:47
Anyone got change for a 10 trillion? Just trying to buy some gum for God sake lol. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 16:01:30
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:07:37
I made a post today for the same answer. Was thinking about Ledger X preorder.
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:45:15
If you could give me the exact time it will drop, that would be great. Thank you. Lol
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:43:17
It’s going to go up and down like your girlfriend’s mood swings. The trick is to get out before you see a mood swing coming and come back when it’s over.
@_date: 2019-05-10 22:49:33
Would you guys recommend this or another hard wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-10 00:09:06
I know it’s the end of May shipping, but I saw some reports saying it was having trouble before I order one I was wondering if anybody heard anything new. Thank you
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:47:02
Sure you knew that, but didn’t know I was going to stub my big to this morning. Selective future sightings lol.
