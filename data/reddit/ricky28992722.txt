Satoshi definitely exists.  Someone sending coins from his wallet could have stolen the keys.

We need to use this stuff today.   This means businesses must feel the pain of crypto people ditching them if the don’t use crypto. This means laws written to help crypto.  Make a business and accept crypto

Large block sizes mean more transactions can fill a block.  The network speeds up but at the cost of having a small amount of large miners competing to get the next block. With less miners it is easier for govts or a bad actor to target huge mining operations.
There are pros and cons
Pro: faster, everything is on chain
Con: miners become large targets. If targeted the network can be attacked.  
No crypto is perfect

People will still be taking out loans and buying on credit.  Interest rates can’t go much lower. Money is still cheap and will be taken advantage of.  If a crypto truly takes of it will be crazy like this

You are making a huge mistake if you take this deal. You are playing in her world.  She can’t do this.   Everyone knows you value your son more than the btc.  You are teaching your son to bow to ridiculous demands.
He will not respect you for this.
