You still haven't defined spam. What's unsolicited (aren't all Bitcoin transactions unsolicited?) or misuse of network resources? And why is the rule you're giving a fair bet it isn't spam?
So far, probably all of my ~~transactions~~ coins are bought from a direct-buy exchange, and then spent to some other platform (humble bundle, reddit gold, etc.). Following you're rule, my transactions don't fall into the "can't be spam".

But that's only true if you use a channel for each entity you make transactions with. That contradicts the scalability promise of Lightning, because you need to make way more than 1 transaction per month on-chain. Moreover, you need to stash away money for each transaction and can only get it back if the other party is cooperative, or after waiting for two weeks.
You *can* mitigate this by having a few large hubs connecting to everyone (or at least create very large islands). But now you're back to square one: who will run these large hubs? Obviously someone who can afford to lock away a lot of funds with each of their clients. In other words.. banks.


As I said above, you will get the same situation with Lightning. The thing is, I already pay zero fees for each transaction I make with my bank account. On top of that, my funds (well, the banks really) is backed up by my government. So what makes Lightning more attractive than vanilla Bitcoin? It's essentially the same as my current bank (because in the last 100+ years of my bank's existence they have never failed to pay out a single penny).

Problems tend to have bottlenecks, i.e. the thing which is holding all the other components back. To see what shludvigsen2 is saying, consider the following: you are running an i5 2500K (CPU) plus R9 250 (GPU). You notice that the games you want to play aren't running smoothly. Now someone suggest upgrading your CPU to make sure you're able to run the latest games. This suggestion isn't necessarily *wrong*, but your first priority should be upgrading your GPU in this scenario NOT your CPU.
The same is true for the scaling debate in Bitcoin. libsecp256k1 is definitely needed to "play the latest games", but it does absolutely nothing if you do not increase the number of transactions Bitcoin is able to handle.

complains about the ability to vote with the same money over and over again. If you can find supporters from the other side who did the same, it would basically end up in an arms race of "who can make the most transactions per second on the blockchain". Which is a kind of proof of work, but it doesn't really work in this context.
The only way to vote with money is basically to burn it. But nobody is stupid enough to burn bitcoins in order to vote for an online poll (I hope..).

Which has a super-obvious solution: do not relay blocks containing more than X% transactions which are not in your own mempool. As long as the majority of the nodes have an up-to-date mempool the block propagates just fine. Miners including lots of fake transactions will risk their blocks not getting propagated.
@_date: 2016-04-23 12:09:12
Fair, although it's still a bad way of voting. Imagine that rich people and corporations could influence voting results to suit their own interests. That would be ludicrous and no real democracy (wait..). 
But more seriously, a list of companies / developers / mining pools agreeing or disagreeing on something is way more valuable. Not fakeable, and directly tied to the Bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2016-04-11 18:13:05
Are you for real? To quote yourself:


So you can *finally* reindex the whole blockchain a whopping eight times a day? *That's* your bottleneck?
@_date: 2016-04-02 20:53:07
I don't think so. Nodes should accept the block they deemed 'spammy' if they receive another block which is built upon this one. I.e., blocks shouldn't permanently mark a block is invalid because they happened to not have certain transactions in their mempool. So in the worst case the node is a block behind the longest chain on the network, which is totally fine. If such a node is connected to an SPV client, it shouldn't tell it received the spammy block (up until a new block was built upon that one). If miners don't cheat, the 'one-block-behind' situation should only occur if the node is not well connected.
@_date: 2016-04-01 09:18:34
But the chances are very very low that you actually need to make more than one request. Of course it's pretty likely that you miss multiple transactions, but you can just send one request to your peer. And notice that you already need roundtrips in the current situation, because you're using TCP. Less data == less ACKs.
So it may be that thinblocks isn't that necessary *right now*, because the maximum block size is 1 MB. But now imagine that the block size is 8 MB. On a 20 mbit/s connection (my current one :[), it would take 3.2 seconds to transmit a full block alone. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 17:56:54
Interesting contrast. I'm really sceptical about voting with coins, though. It basically means a few whales can manipulate the vote. 
@_date: 2016-04-01 20:23:46


Which leaves a lot of unharvested transaction fees floating around. I'm pretty confident that greed will find a way :).


Well, I don't know. The dev mailing list is a pretty toxic place, so I'm steering clear from it. 
I'm running a node right now to keep track of how many transactions are typically in its mempool when receiving a new block. Based on these numbers it should be pretty easy to argue whether it can be done. I do plan on creating a gist/small blogpost and posting it here and "the subreddit which cannot be named".

As long as it's publicly known which nodes should have the content, it's trivial for the nodes to watch each other. They might calculate a hash of random parts of the data (HASH(bit 1, bit 45, bit 398, etc.) for example) and ask another node to calculate the same hash. If they cannot, assume they don't have the file also.


True, unless there's an incentive to do so. (But even then I'm not sure you would want to use this scheme to host anything but backups for now..)

Then you might want to encrypt with a different key for each node, and store hashes of random parts of each encrypted file. In order to allow nodes besides yourself to check upon the other nodes, you might also want to handout some of the hashes. As long as you keep a few completely secret you can check all nodes yourself (and if the other nodes are honest, so can they even though they do not have the same data).

Don't take it personally. There has been a LOT of negative feedback from other subreddits (and other communities not on Reddit) which view Bitcoin as a gigantic ponzi scheme due to all the price talk. See for example:
These are the only links I could find quickly with a simple Google query, but there is a lot more out there. The point is: a large part of feels we should only discuss technical features, news and events and not focus on gambling (what is essentially what you're doing right now). Please, do not 'invest' in Bitcoin if your only use for it is making money. It's exactly the same as gambling, as you don't have any idea what you're buying.

@_date: 2014-03-31 12:17:36
Excellent question. And the answer is: nothing prevents you from trying. However, if nodes notice you're trying to double spend they will not propagate your transaction further. On top of that, well-connected nodes like the ones Blockchain.info have (which are probably the ones handling the merchant transaction), can monitor the network and detect double spends and act upon it accordingly.
So: you would have to wait until the merchant accepts the transaction (probably after 2 seconds) and then send another transaction. _But_, this transaction has a very high probability of being rejected by the network as it comes after your first one - which has already propagated through 99+% of the network.
To give you an idea of how fast the internet is (and thus how fast transactions can propagate) we can use a server in the Netherlands to ping a server in New Zealand (more or less exactly a trip around the world). [Here]( you can see which (and the amount of) routers it passes through: in this case 21. [This command]( shows the time it takes for the signal to travel back AND forth: ~280ms.
For big transactions (&gt;= 10.000€) I wouldn't trust zero-confirmations, but for groceries it is more than enough to know the network is *really* fast.

He did name a few:






These can all be considered solutions to very real problems. Maybe they're not problems to YOU, but that doesn't really matter for other people. Identity management allows most eavesdropping methods by governments (NSA) to be virtually bypassed. Same goes for censorship. Cheap international finance allow large sums of money to be shipped back and forth between the USA and China, which helps businesses immensely.
Further more, Bitcoin (the currency) allows people to actually have money in a manner comparable to having gold (*actually* having it). With all the benefits of gold, fiat AND digital networks - and none of the downsides. This is, again, a solution for what's considered to be a very real problem by a lot of people.
So again, if you have no problems with the USA (more or less) controlling the internet, the NSA spying, censorship, absurdly high (inter)national transaction fees, not being able to control your own money and not having programmable money: that's OK, then Bitcoin isn't a solution. But it can and maybe will solve these problems if intelligent people like the Bitcoin Core developers (and members of the open-source community) start working on them.

I think the relay network would continue to exist as it is, even with thinblocks deployed. edit: The reason I think this is because the fast relay network is actually bookkeeping which node has which transaction, so it can save a few round trips. This is very valuable for miners, but less so for nodes. Maybe it will become important for normal nodes as well in the future, which would be pretty easy to implement anyway.
This study tries to determine how many normal nodes would get a new block within a reasonable timeframe, given a certain block size. They chose 90% and 12 seconds as their thresholds for 'good enough', which turned out to correspond with around 4MB. With thinblocks deployed block sizes don't really matter that much as most nodes would have a majority (95%+) of the transaction already in their mempool. Not transmitting the whole blocks would make it way more easy to stay within 12 seconds (and thus the block size can be significantly raised). (Enabling `blocksonly` doesn't help and would even makes things worse. Furthermore: blocksonly disables the ability to view 0-conf transactions, so it's not comparable to thinblocks.)

I'm not 100% sure what you're asking. When a thin block propagates the network, it only contains (very small) hashed values of each transaction (plus the proof of work, of course). The receiver can use these hash values to determine if it already has the full transaction in its mempool and basically build the whole block itself. Only if it misses a transaction, it will ask the sender of the thinblock. On average, this yields a [18:1 compression ratio]( when compared to 'dumb' block propagation.

About miners spamming blocks: just include a node rule which says at least 50% (or whatever) of the transactions in a new block should be in mempool in order for it to be relayed. This significantly increases the risk of miners of having their block orphaned, thus they won't to it.
@_date: 2016-03-31 21:22:22
Only if you compare it to a 'blocksonly' configuration. A full-relaying node will have to always relay all transactions, plus the full block without thinblocks. With it, it still has to relay all transactions, but not full blocks.

Why do you think transactions with a chain longer than 10 are 'spam', 'gaming' or 'mixing'?
@_date: 2016-03-31 19:14:22




Would you care to elaborate? Thinblocks does reduce the bandwidth usage significantly, *especially* where it actually matters (block propagation). If you can't handle the normal upload rate of incoming transactions (times the number of peers you're connected to) you should consider connecting to less peers.


Not right now, because the block size is still 1MB. But that's exactly the question this paper tries to evaluate: how big can blocks get while still having reasonable propagation latencies. These propagation latencies are dominated by actually transmitting the whole block, which you wouldn't have to do with thinblocks deployed. It therefore increases the safe block size limit.
@_date: 2016-03-17 14:04:51
So in simple terms your argument is: (SPV) nodes which were wrongfully trusting the nodes could now get punished more easily for their behaviour? I fail to see any fundamental change from the current situation.

15% or 12% are numbers which keep popping up without explanation. The theory is simple: if you've got all transactions in your mempool, you don't need to transmit a mined block. Well-connected nodes can therefore expect a bandwidth reduction of up to a theoretical 50% (minus some communication overhead). The code has already been running in BitcoinXT, completely invalidating the 12/15 numbers.
But anyway, can you provide a source?

You don't have to relay the full block if you find one. Most nodes will have close to all transactions in their mempool already. I'm sure the developers can come up with something clever.

But there are so so many things you can do to reduce those bandwidth requirements!
