Man even .23 btc is over C$1k. It must have been this though.

Yea if it could just go ahead and plummet once more so I can finally invest all of my money... that'd be great.

Great job.
I've been planning to ask my parents to place a Bitcoin symbol on their front desk in order to gauge interest levels and/or spread the word.

I'm sorry, you know nothing about branding.

Because the average person still has no idea what a Bitcoin is, unfortunately.

a) Everyone already knows that Heineken **is** in fact cool :)
b) *Everyone* knows who Heineken is (they're certainly amongst the most well established brands in the market, and I'm not talking about beer drinkers - Everyone else knows who they are too.)
c) Heineken has no business being anything but true to itself. Ref: a, b, then have a look at their market share, etc. Fenominal as usual.
d) I'm not sure you really understand how marketing works.

Classic theme is so much more resource efficient!

I think it's safe to say that you take the actions made on Twitter a little too seriously. This wasn't a business meeting. There was no "bluffing".
Why would Heineken randomly mention Bitcoin in a tweet with no motive behind it? It doesn't make a lot of sense. They are clearly testing the waters in an effort to gauge the public's interest in the matter.
Large corporations don't use social media like you &amp; I do. Their updates are not made randomly, on-the-fly. They're developed as a part of their plan of action to achieve specific goals.
I'm not even sure how else you figure they would attempt to "capitalize" on this situation.
