In practice, a lot of merchants peg their prices to some currency they trust (usually US$), so the BTC price changes frequently, and convert their revenue to their preferred currency as soon as possible.

The UK BTC exchange situation is indeed frustrating. (I live in the UK but luckily I still have a bank account in the Eurozone...)
We need exchanges. We need a quality interface between the BTC economy and the British banking system (with its silly provincial currency...). But, sadly, doing that right isn't easy.
If the Bitcoin-24 drama has taught me anything, it's to always look for an indication that the exchange is on top of the legal implications of what they're doing. Bitcoin-central's (bless 'em) €250 limit for non-verified users? May be a pain in the arse, but it is reassuring.

Where do you get the 50% figure?

But what does it do?

The owner has posted scans of a number of relevant documents (in German) at  The accounts were frozen on suspicion of money laundering; this is not at all surprising considering that the site did not conduct any user verification - see this thread: 
The situation escalated when BTC-24 had been down for a day or two and the owner failed to provide any proper explanation of the situation to his customers. One, at least, ( formally filed charges of fraud.
That much we know. Everything that's happened so far appears to be completely regular and justified, what we don't know is what the prosecution will actually accuse Mr Hausdorf of. Getting the formal charges together takes time, time that a criminal could use to hide away the money.
I think Hausdorf is probably a good guy, but he's clearly careless in a way that is inexcusable when dealing with these amounts of money. I hope that all former users of BTC-24 can get their money back without having to go the legal route...

"Much better exchange rates and fees"
I doubt that. Does anybody have figures on what exchange rates the BitcoinATM uses? From watching the video that made its rounds the other day, I guessed they use (some reference rate) ± 5%.
That's a 10% loss for the traveller. Even even if they skew the rates less, you'll still be paying something of the order of 5-10% on top of the "true" fiat-to-fiat exchange rate (which is reasonably well defined). That's probably better than many bureaux de change. That *might* be better than *some* credit/debit cards, but generally, that's expensive. With my main debit card I pay less than 2% for foreign currency.
