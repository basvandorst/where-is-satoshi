I'm using it because it's requiring my iddentity infos, what do you mean ? It's not clear for me. I dont want to make profit, just want to sell my euros and buy bitcoins
@_date: 2019-11-24 23:01:57
But what about the law ? Since bitcoin is not money ? In France ? In Estonia ?

I will not reply, I'm getting out of this centralised system, say Hi to localbitcoin and bisq :p

Yes it is hard to exchange fiat on bisq. I am already in use with this software.

They can ask but then it will be difficult for them to purchase me because of the tiny amount.

Why and how ? It's a mail
@_date: 2019-11-24 23:01:12
They dont have any satoshi at this moment, they have nothing on their side.
@_date: 2019-11-24 23:11:41
I'm okay to try that so lets do not care about it and just not reply to them

I'm using bisq and localbitcoins now, I was talking about old coins got on exchanges that I want to anonymise and get on local wallet that I own

Thx mate all of my bitcoins are on my local machine, they cant do anything, but they can see that I have mixed all of them, so am I legally supposed to provide the proof (and my actual address) to theses bankers ?

Was not aware of this thank  you, what about the new exchanges who do not need it ?
