I don't know what you're trying to say.
everyone is a different chemical cocktail and responds and acts slightly differently.
While not everyone can fit in a group it's still rather easy to group men and women from their taste/choices and their actions/persona. 
While men rarely talk about feelings, women are a feeling machine and can hardly look at something objectively.
Science what?
Bill the nye the socialist guy? carbon tax!!!!!!!!!

well I heard that before; and maybe we're some sort of 5th dimensional star projection.
all interesting thoughts and is potentially possible, but few if any know the truth. everything is speculation in a sense, as in science nothing is proved true.

What about those who use magnets or electrical stimuli to turn on and off parts of the brain. In one study I recall from a JRE podcast that dr rhonda patrick was talking about; in the study I think they were trying to isolate consciousness. While the subject was reading a book they zapped a part of the brain. She stopped and starred at the scientist in the room with a blank expressionless face.
They zapped here again then she continued reading. She had no recollection of the event.
There is a whole community behind it that are experimenting on themselves. There is some work done in efforts to improve cognitive functions that involve this method and can zap on or off parts of the brain. Neal brennon (netflix comedy special/co-wrote chappelle show) talks about a therapy he went through that used magnetic pulses to treat a part of the brain associated with depression. 
Another thing to consider is Traumatic brain injury. Some fighters get so much brain damage in a fight that they come out of the ring a noticeably different person.
While I might give some credit to people being out of their bodies; there is plenty of scientific evidence showing that many traits are local and can be modified, thus exist within the brain/body.

This may be some bullshit, but I heard somewhere about reality running like frames, segmented with space in between each segment of reality something well over a trillion times a second. 
I forget how they measured this; I don't remember reading an article on it.
