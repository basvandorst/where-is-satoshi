I've got an unconfirmed transaction from several years ago that I'm hoping to see appear as my Bitcoin core wallet syncs up. If       it doesn't sync and appear, I'm sunk. I lost the sending wallet along time ago. :(
If the transaction does re-appear, I doubt the transaction fee I paid several years ago will be enough to get it confirmed in the current market. 
Does anyone know if it's possible to add miners fees from the receiving wallet after the original transaction has been sent (long ago). 
My only hope right now is that by using a Bitcoin core receiving wallet, and downloading the blockchain, I will have proof of this unconfirmed transaction. 
I always thought that transactions were irreversible and have been counting on this. What doesn't seem fair at the moment to me is that when I sent the transaction, the miners market was different than it is today. There should be more cut and dry rules regarding transactions. As it is now, the miners are making up the rules as they go along.
.When I sent this transaction, micro-payments were a thing. And miners made their money by mining coins. IMO that should have never changed. If there wasn't enough money for them to make, the whole system should have scaled back. Implementing a 72 hour time frame on transactions just screws people who aren't up on the latest rule changes. This feels a lot like dealing with a bank. :(

Can the the miners just charge a fee for their service? This whole idea that the user needs to pay a fee but no reliable info can be given regarding fee size and transaction time is ridiculous. This is what will always prevent btc from being a reliable payment system.
If I need a good or service , I ask what people are charging. This whole business of leaving a payment and then the miners decide latter if it's an appropriate amount doesn't work.

The idea that ANY currency would blacklist units is preposterous, douche nozzle. The whole point of currency is fungibility. I change user names regularly as there is no advantage to trying to establish a 'reputation' be it good or bad. Privacy is a commodity after all. Keep on trolling, you'll get better at it someday.

Baby boomers can kiss my ass. Here in Cali they got a fantastic education for free. When the graduated, they had jobs waiting for them. They then purchased real estate for a nickel. As their real estate values soared, they were expected to pay more in taxes that fund education. Instead of paying these taxes, they passes prop 13, which cut their taxes 60% and ruined the school system. If they don't get into Bitcoin, my heart bleeds chunky peanut butter for them.

The robbers are the credit card companies. They charge a larger fee for smaller transactions.

What is meant by current payment system.?The are many different payment systems currently. If you're asking if it will be the most used current payment system, that's going to take a long time, if ever. It doesn't need to ever be the most used payment system to have value. It's only 8 years old and has risen from about 1 penny per btc to over $1000 usd currently. I avoid asking market people about economics and also don't ask economists about it since the later base there opinions on theory that can't account for Bitcoin since it's something that has never existed before 8 years ago.

I don't know more. I wish I did. Seems like a complicated topic. The wallet one uses may make a difference. I use Bitcoin core and my wallet is out of sync with the blockchain. I'm hoping that a very old transaction will still be valid as my wallet syncs.

By using Electrum and not waiting days, you have an extra layer between yourself and your private keys. That layer is Electrum and      
there're probably decent people who aren't going to screw you over, but why trust anyone? By not downloading the blockchain, you're taking additional risk, however slight. Good luck to all of us.:$

The government really can't be trusted with money. They've proven this countless times. What's the national debt right now? How long have we been "at war"? I can't in good conscious support the charade. Too many people are doing the mans work for the man. Not me.

The 2 second pay that Apple and Android provide is great as long as the currency backing it is secure. The "I want it now" philosophy is what created the banking collapse in 2008. The next one is around the corner. 
What's more important convenience or sound currency?

The sender did a bad typo there. Has he contacted the miners? Some have returned in situations like this as they get good publicity. This post borders on FUD since it implies that 50 btc was charged by miners for transaction.

Govts want the money in the bank. If you give your money to someone else to "hold" for you, sooner or later they will try to steal it from you.

Yes, other situations carry their own unique particulars. The bottom line is somewhat familiar though. Countries want their population holding cash in bank accounts. By providing an option to hold digitally, the question becomes, "Why have a bank account at all". And "why not control my own wealth". This is a fascinating and potentially game changing possibility. ��

Is there a way to determine which fiat currency bills have been used for criminal activity? How about if we tested all USD for containing the presence of cocaine? All dollars that test positive for coke have been used for illicit reasons. Does your logic follow?

How about creating a decentralized, autonomous, encrypted piece of software the uses Bitcoin for payment. Something like a cross between Uber and Tinder, pairing riders with drivers and using btc for payment. Just for example. Think about the aspects of Bitcoin that you respect and implement them in a new service that needs providing.
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:00:36
Yep. If you're not familiar with localbitcoins.com, check it out. You can sell btc at slightly above market value.
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:28:29
And I understand your frustration with the processing time. I spent some time banging my head on this issue a couple years ago. It may be that btc transfers never exceed CC in speed. Though truthfully it's much faster. The only reason CC's appear to be faster is that a 3rd party "covers the bet" for them. So the consumer gets fast transaction speeds and will probably never give that up. The retailers really pay the cost for this, particularly with processing small charges. So, either the retailer needs to be won over to Bitcoin or the banks and credit card companies need to utilize Bitcoin to back their antiquated payment system. I believe that later is more likely. Have patience, Bitcoin is only 8 years old and has come quite a long way in short time. ����

Ideally, as mining difficulty increases, the coin value also increases. Thus miners reap fewer coins that are worth more.

I met 2 guys from India the other day. They're here working high tech. Having asked them about the currency manipulation they first told me it was intended to stop the blackmarket. I responded that the farmers hold cash to pay the daylaborers. They acknowledged this and said that some people would be hurt but since it effected the poor, they didn't seem to mind.

Training the cashiers is a real obstacle. These are people that are required to do more work, for no more pay. They will be hoping that no one ever pays in btc and may even be antagonistic to those that do. The arrangement is tenuous in my experience. I once spent quite a while trying convince an uninformed  cashier that our transaction had multiple conformations. He didn't understand it and had no financial incentive to understand it.
