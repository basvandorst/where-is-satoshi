Thanks for that. I'm cool with the rollercoaster, at least conceptually. I'm curious though what you mean about liquidity issues in Euro. Can you elaborate? Harsher regulations or more fees? More scrutiny?

understood, and agreed. More than anything I'm trying to understand if there's any benefits of using Bitcoin instead of a money transfer to get my money from one country to another. Maybe, to the contrary, it'll be more hassle than it's worth. I'm also interested about possibly receiving partial payment of the house and Bitcoin ,maybe that might have any tax benefits or implications since I might not cash that out to USD.

To the contrary, I understand Fiat and gov monetary policy, hence I don't see a clear path to BTC adoption as a replacement, unless there is an economy based on the use of BTC from raw good to final product.
That is not a current reality. But another post mentioned we're in the early days. So wild West. Ok, I can buy that.

My point, exactly.
@_date: 2019-06-11 05:41:40
Gotcha. Thanks

I see. So basically you're saying we're not there yet because BTC is an immature currency. That makes sense.
