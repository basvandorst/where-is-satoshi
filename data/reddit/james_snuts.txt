Today has really put me off the subreddit. I USED to see it as  THE place I got my important bitcoin related news/information. Now I don't.

I agree, volume is the only downside. Hoping this changes soon, if it does IMO it could become Europe's premier exchange.

Would centralization inhibit bitcoins development due to its decentralized mantra?

Very quick! 1 day to verify, all you need is phone number and address. I didnt even have to show proof of address or identification.

Once again, bad advice. This is how people loose a lot, rather than a little.

Of course, that'd simplify my life x 100

btc-e scares the shit out of me, but Kraken feels secure... also under the impression they wont just run away..

Good luck!

very good, and really user friendly

But who can step up to provide this service if not government? That is a lot of wealth (and trust) to put into the hands of a private company.

That's not investing 101, very bad advice, and how people turn minor losses into major losses.
