Thank you for the thoughtful answers Theymos.  This is very very helpful. Funny that you were the one to respond of all subscribers, I've seen your name many times.  Thank you for supporting Bitcoin.

Wow thank you so much for explaining. The seed function was the last main point I was having trouble wrapping my head around but now I get it. I will be able to explain Bitcoin to people so much easier now.   Is this essentially similar technology that has been used for serial number generation for decades?
Basically if I use my Trezor recovery key, as long as I have my seed I can generate a new address AND send commands to my old addresses that I've already generated. Correct?  Because each key generates the same order of addresses, every time. 
Other questions...
So if I understand correctly about the transaction data. If I checked the transaction data through different wallets that I both control. (Coinbase and Trezor for example). I can reasonably assume that the transactions are set in stone after a few confirmations correct?
Regarding firmware updates, I guess not updating isn't an option because the server could choose to not interface with my Trezor.  Also I understand it's open source right?  So people are theoretically checking these out on a regular basis. 
Thanks again for the answers.

Statements like this are destructive, and incorrect. Capitalism has birthed us everything we use every single day by inspiring everyday entrepreneurs and small business owners to provide value to their customers. 
It allows people to become specialized workers, earning more for themselves while doing things they enjoy.
Endless modern technological achievements have been acheived through capitalism.  Nearly every piece of technology we use today came from company that is given the opportunity to exist in capitalistic system. 
Crypto currency is about to transform the world into true late stage capitalism, where the market is free and open to all participants. Crypto will further decentralize the power structures incrementally over time, reducing the power of the currently corrupt.
Much of the current complaints about capitalism stem from CRONY capitalism. In other words corruption. 
Corruption is a CONSTANT force in human nature. It's important to understand this, because no matter what power structure you set up for a country. Eventually it will become corrupted, case in point the current US Congress. It's a cess pool of corruption. The major mistake there was lack of term limits. And we are paying for it dearly these days. 
To loop this back into why crypto currency will be the backbone of our new world economy.  An individual having individual control of their money is tantamount to perpetual freedom.  It also breaks us free of the chains of the debt economy.  
Everything we all want in this world is there. The pieces are set. Now it is up to us, the people.  If you really want to bring equal opportunity to the world. Get behind crypto currency with everything you have. Talk about it. Be about it. Spend it. Buy it.

The hypocrisy here is quite astounding.  Read anywhere else on reddit or even this sub and if someone posts asking for advice on what to do IF they break the law or something bad happens. 
It's always "never give up information" and "don't incriminate yourself". 
But yet in the same breath we change our position when it personally affects us.

Few people ever bring this up. Money is supposed to serve as a TRANSFER of value. Not inherently hold value over the long term. (It can of course, but that's not it's original purpose)

Why are there not more upvotes for this!
Truth.

That would make sense to me, whichever one is picked up by all the Nodes as the solution quicker?  Interesting. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:43:12
This raises an interesting question however. What happens when two miners get two different values at the same time (but they are both lower than the difficulty value)?

What a load of crap. It was not by any means "easy" to access the Silk Road. It took moderate intelligence and at least a solid day of research.

The first 75% of your post is nonsense. 
However anonymous Bitcoin money is perfect for reddit. Why?  Because anonymity is what makes reddit great. You are forced to evaluate comments based on their content. NOT who they are coming from. 
This opens up the gate to lies, lots of lies.  But it also opens up the gate to universal truths, and untold perspectives.  Which is what makes reddit beautiful.

Yes but the government bought bad debt. Which was worth much less than the face value, yet they paid face value to help the banks.

Yeah. Sure. Exponentially less demand for it as volume increases.

@_date: 2016-12-19 05:43:10
Precisely. I'm forecasting a meteoric rise to $10,000 and then a spectacular crash to $2000-$3000.  Basically the same pattern that has repeated it self during the rise of $0 to $100, then crash to $30. Then the rise from that to $1000, then crash to $200-$300.  Once we rise past the All Time High, the stage will be set for some major, dramatic Bitcoin wave of adoption. Something external from price will have to trigger this, like a major technical advancement or usability. This wave of new buyers will propel the price to the next order of magnitude = $10,000.  The crash will happen once saturation of that wave of adopters is high. The crash will be fueled by some other major event. Some other major obstacle. 
At least that's my three satoshis on it. ;]

Yes thank you!  I like the Debug one that is a good a text feed.  
Is the TCP dump just all the IP addresses (with all their meta data) coming out of the network card or something?   Is there anyway to strip this data to down to display only the IP address?  
Thanks for the good answers!  I wish their was a visualizer out there somewhere that would visualize all the transactions being broadcasted, collected, and then finally mined &amp; added to the chain.   Might have to look into making one as a hobby... ha.
@_date: 2016-12-28 08:49:45
Yup that's how I see it too. Some block "filling up" then zpapped and moved to the major stack.  Like a long snake continually eating transactions.  Or like something being poured as cement. 
Damn I really want to do this now. Haha.

Assuming you can get past the difficulty is a huge logical jump. If 90% of the miners stopped mining Bitcoin right now it would bring it to a screeching halt.

Mutual funds and hedge funds being able to buy in through a regulated vector. Like an ETF.

I would recommend just leaving your coins where they are until the drama has subsidized. Only if you control the private keys that is. The older the address the more "secure" technically. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 05:45:42
Aka lets tax Bitcoin. No thank you. Don't touch my money. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:50:18
An older address is automatically included in the recent chain splits. If you move your coins around after these forks, and the fork you choose eventually dies off, you risk not being able to recover your coins on the new chain. 
It's a small chance but technically possible with the right amount of bad luck and misunderstanding.

War is always funded against public opinion by debasing the currency and loaning the government X amount to pay for war. 
Before that, in order to fund warm the public actually had to BUY war bonds. Which mean the government was trapped for cash. In today's world the government just goes into debt with the federal reserve for no penalty since the currency isn't backed by anything. 
I hope I explained that well enough.

Tried transferring a super small amount. Went through fine. Tried transferring a larger amount right after (less than 1 coin) says its pending. Receiving Wallet doesn't show pending Transaction.

It was a challenging time. Lot of people lost a lot of money. But now everyone has made that back who has stuck around. A lot "I was right all along" mentality. Which just reinforces people's egos and beliefs. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:18:52
The miners were never truly in favor of this. They want on chain transactions so they can get a cut. 
Core never compromised. Showed almost no ability to discuss like adults, because they have no incentive too. It's a lose-lose for the miners. Even tho, people forget this, that miners are essentially what "back" the network by powering transactions. 
Bitcoin ABC is a solid backup plan and with larger block sizes will drop fees to near zero again. Hopefully it's used as leverage to increase the block size because honestly it has to go up EVENTUALLY no matter what. 
Honestly I think both coins have a chance of surviving. 
Either way we all get two copies! Lol
