I attempted to withdraw on the 4th the 3 btc I had left there and it left my account and never ended up in either of the two seperate accounts I sent the btc.  So its been 48 hours and I still do not have the btc balance in mtgox and no deposit on my offline wallet.   I did submit a support ticket but due to all the issues they are busy and haven't got a response will update when anything changes.  Just glad I only had 3 coins left in their hopefully we will all get our btc back soon.

it wasn't that significant of a rise plus i used it to buy facebook which more than doubled in value since I bought after the ipo value tanked...

nice sold my shares a year ago or I would do the same... I am headed to verizon today to purchase a droid instead.  I am also done recommending the iphone to the 211 people who ask me everyday what phone should I buy.

What you say may very well be true... Although I am not quite as cynical - My only point is that only a short sited fool would choose to rob an exchange when they could sit back and collect the recurring revenue from the trading commission.   If bitcoin explodes one day all these so called "criminals" will be sorry....

Im joking about 211 people....  Verizon has way better coverage down here in Georgia and the LTE coverage is everywhere.  Plus I have a business account with several lines so while it is slightly more expensive the coverage is supreme which is more important to me.

maybe but no point in debating with you we are not going to change each others minds...

The past 24 hours have been irresponsible to say the least and it pisses me off for multiple reasons.
1. Taking the website down completely with no warning or explanation, that is amateur hour.
2. The explanation that has appeared on the website is even worse.  Why would mtgox or anyone post a public statement this important and not give it more than five minutes of thought?
     a. "In light of recent news reports and the potential repercussions on MtGox's operations and the market" - I love how they blame their decisions on recent news reports when its obvious who is at fault.  Responsibility isn't in their vocabulary...
     b. "close all transactions" - Why not try telling the truth when its obvious? In other words MtGox has decided to shut the website down! Don't try to water it down by saying transactions have been closed when its obviously so much more...
    c.  "protect the site and our users" - Appeal to our fear and need of protection is just classic bullshit. If their goal was to protect why not limited withdraws, make a commitment to pay everyone back, and/or at least given us access to our account so we see our btc are still on deposit. 
I had some hope that mtgox could make a comeback but at this point 99 percent of that hope has faded...  The leadership of mtgox should rethink their PR and business strategy before its too late.  Every action has a reaction and the poor decisions of the past 24 hours are beyond my comprehension.
At this point I wish someone in MtGox leadership would attempt to support the bitcoin community instead of ignorantly trying to tear it down...

Stealing the money from a profitable business is always smarter than building actual wealth from a recurring revenue stream....

3 btc - hopefully i get them back one day.... I have bought 3 btc to replace them though so not the end of the world....  I hope that mtgox finds a way to make it right.  In my opinion, not worth much, it be nice if they asked everyone who has btc left in mtgox if they would invest it for 3 years for a percentage of ownership in the rebuild....  I'd do it would you?

I ended up purchasing the S4 (i have a biz plan with verizon so no nexus available) Its been 8 days and I decided to keep it yesterday.  I almost went with the htc one but I like that I can carry a spare battery and swap it easily.  I haven't had a ton of time to set it up 100 percent and am kinda annoyed I can't tie google wallet for tap and pay feature due to verizon bs but I can live with it. At least now I can enjoy freedom from the app store.

Bitcoin alone obviously doesn't provide recurring revenue; but, a business model that charges a percentage of revenue traded is the pretty much the definition of a recurring revenue.  How was MtGox business model not based primarily on recurring revenue from each trade, please explain?
From investopedia:
 
Definition of 'Recurring Revenue'
The portion of a company's revenue that is highly likely to continue in the future. This is revenue that is predictable, stable and can be counted on in the future with a high degree of certainty.

I have been thinking the exact same thing, and thats what I meant by the 211 people.  People ask me constantly what phone should I buy and I will now be recommending a different brand.   
I wonder how far the bitcoin community reach is when it comes to cell phone purchases.   Pretty sure all of us are seen as tech experts in our work and personal life...

Just wanted to post a response:  Coinbase refunded my money it took a few days and then they white listed me so my other purchases were not canceled.   While their customer service is lacking I will still buy from them.
