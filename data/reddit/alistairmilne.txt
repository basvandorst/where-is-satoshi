Changing security settings (especially removing security) should be a lot harder than logging into a site with 2FA! If it was that easy then BitGo are incompetent imo
@_date: 2016-08-17 12:14:08
Worse than not verifying properly are the words: "without BitGo realizing it"
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:16:11
I concur - an IOU which can be traded on the exchange &amp; paid back each month from earnings would likely get you the &gt;75% consent you probably need to resume trading.
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:28:23
Thanks for the lol's
You sound like a BitGo employee might sound trying to defend signing off on a 119k BTC hack.
If you think that the security of $10's of millions should rest on a single user and his 2FA device then you should consider a career in comedy
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:15:51
Could easily be wrong, but with &gt;75% agreement from those who lost coins, I believe Bitfinex could restart trading ... so the above doesn't seem too far fetched.

Yes, if you were an investigator you'd start by looking at Bitfinex staff then BitGo's. Particularly any recent (unhappy) employee departures
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:36:07
They do have this logic - even for transfers of balances a fraction of the size of a wallet. You can wait hours for a person to verify by hand.
Apparently the hacker found a huge loophole in BitGo's security algos
@_date: 2016-08-04 09:23:59
The only ways I can see BitGo claim 0 responsibility are:
a/ the cold storage key was used (Bitfinex claim this was not the case)
b/ Bitfinex directors wrote to BitGo asking for all security restrictions to be lifted, indemnifying BitGo for the consequences
c/  aliens
If BitGo gave Bitfinex an API or other form of online 'super user' access which bypassed ALL basic controls then they are absolutely negligent in my view.
I assume that Bitfinex paid for this service, therefore BitGo must share responsibility for how the client was setup ... unless, you know ... aliens.

The whole point of multi-sig with keys held by separate parties is to stop procedures and rules being easy to bypass. Otherwise, you'd just do it yourself!

When financial controls are put in place, when the banks freeze everyone's money, when your government declares a 'bail-in' for your bank, when you are forced to convert funds into a national currency that will be devalued enormously ...  then only physical cash, diamonds, gold/silver &amp; Bitcoin will function as portable and easily tradable wealth.  This is why Greeks have been withdrawing €billions from their accounts in recent days/weeks.
(Possibly) losing 50% is very attractive vs certainly losing 100% or having everything frozen for an unknown period.  Bitcoin is the most versatile unit of value ever created.

If the premium persists, there will be many new GBTC shares issued to accredited investors hoping to sell at a premium in 12 months or simply because they want to invest without the premium. This also creates buying pressure as GBTC will be forced to buy. 
Non technical investors could sell GBTC and buy the Swedish ETN (exchange traded note) that launches in a couple of weeks.
All these new investment vehicles provide an important function and will likely make up a large portion of raw BTC exchange volume in the future. 
Extremely early days, but one thing is certain: ETFs and ETNs just grow and grow over time. Bitcoin's market cap will follow.

$ETC survived with 0.5% of hashpower (albeit with a faster difficulty adjustment).  Those miners made a very good profit in the following days!
Miners will want to 'hedge' their bets in the same ways investors will.  I.e. knowing both coins will be traded on exchanges, the 'minor' chain may still have 30-40% of hashpower (but more user &amp; industry support).  They may welcome the lack of competition and be happy to invest until the difficulty readjusts or a new fork is offered (which would reset difficulty if that was an issue).
How many *minutes* do you think it would take the Core devs to fix the difficulty &amp; issue new software so 'their' chain functions?  EDIT:  they'd probably have it ready to go before the fork even happened

That is a fair critique, however Bitcoin does behave somewhat like a stock as people are speculating by investing (or panic selling, as currently seems the trend!).

Bitstamp Service Temporarily Suspended
We have reason to believe that one of Bitstamp’s operational wallets was compromised on January 4th, 2015.
As a security precaution against compromises Bitstamp only maintains a small fraction of customer bitcoins in online systems. Bitstamp maintains more than enough offline reserves to cover the compromised bitcoins.
IN THE MEANTIME, PLEASE DO NOT MAKE DEPOSITS TO PREVIOUSLY ISSUED BITCOIN DEPOSIT ADDRESSES. THEY CANNOT BE HONORED!
Customer deposits made prior to January 5th, 2015 9:00 UTC are fully covered by Bitstamp’s reserves. Deposits made to newly issued addresses provided after January 5th, 2015 9:00 UTC can be honored.
Bitstamp takes our security and soundness very seriously. In an excess of caution, we are suspending service as we continue to investigate. We will return to service and amend our security measures as appropriate.

So the winner (check my Twitter account) didn't want the coin and I instead sent a photo of the private key to him so he could sweep the balance to his own wallet.
Hence the 'speed' of the balance going to zero.
We actually waited overnight to ensure all bids confirmed and in case anyone objected to the selection of the winner.  No-one did.
He managed to get his winning bid into Blockchain.info's mempool just 4seconds before the cut off time. Impressive.

Hi, this is a new site that will launch in mid-Aug for a closed beta trial period.
Think of it a bit like Twitter, but you will earn bits for any 'likes/favourites' your posts earn. Later on, users will also earn additional payments from ad income in proportion to the ad impressions their content helps generate.
So a little like Youtube's partner program, with no minimum entry requirement or payment ... and all Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-09-10 08:35:57
Unless you are still buying, stop watching the price until at least the new year and ideally next spring.
Experienced traders are deliberately spooking amateur investors into selling ... it is a transfer from any 'weak hands' into 'strong hands'.  It is actually a necessary process if we want Bitcoin to be 100x one day.  If you liked Bitcoin at $500, you should love it at $240.
There will be a turning point in the next 6-9 months where the selling dries up in anticipation of the halving. FOMO will begin again.  I won't be boring and give target prices but SO many more people are able to easily buy Bitcoin now than in late 2013 and far more people have stopped thinking it is a fad/scam.
I can't wait for the fireworks to start.

Wall Street is putting more money behind a technology it once dismissed as a fad.
Some of the biggest companies in the financial sector have invested $30 million in Chain Inc., a San Francisco- based company that works with banks and other institutions to develop ways to trade and transfer financial assets using the system that underpins the virtual currency Bitcoin.
Investors include Visa Inc., Nasdaq Inc., Citi Ventures, Capital One Financial Corp., Fiserv Inc. and Orange SA.
A valuation for Chain wasn't disclosed as part of the fundraising round, which Chain announced on Wednesday. The company also said former American Express Co. CEO and venture capitalist Jim Robinson III has joined its board.
The investment is the latest sign of Wall Street's about-face with Bitcoin, which banks and other financial firms initially said was unlikely to transform commerce. These financial companies don't have any interest in using the actual currency. But they see the "blockchain" technology that lets Bitcoin users instantaneously make and record transactions as a potential replacement for what they say is a cumbersome, costly and less-secure process.
Vast bureaucracies exist inside banks and at third-party firms to verify and process the buying and selling of everything from foreign currencies to stocks.
The blockchain is a record of every transaction ever made using Bitcoin. But rather than being held in a central database or institution, it is spread out over a network of independent computers and verified continuously by participants in the network instead of a central authority. Other blockchains have been created unrelated to Bitcoin.
Its proponents say the technology might make it possible for a stock or other asset to change owners in the blink of an eye, instead of the roughly three days and several steps of intermediaries it takes now.
While the technology is gaining popularity among many on Wall Street, it could take years before a critical mass of financial institutions agree to throw their weight behind a new protocol for processing and clearing transactions.
There are also questions about whether blockchains can be secure enough to handle a huge influx of sensitive transactions and how easily legacy financial institutions could start making such a radical change to the way they operate.
"We believe in the power of blockchain technology to transform how financial assets are transferred, but it has to be done with the right partners to insure it gets off the ground," said Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain, in an interview.
The company is working with Nasdaq on using the technology to facilitate the trading of stakes in unlisted companies on its private market, but Nasdaq is able to set that up without cooperation from other institutions.
To change something bigger, such as how stocks or corporate bonds are transferred among investors, will require broad agreements from across the financial sector.
"The devil is in the details," said Houman Shadab, a law professor at New York Law School who studies blockchains. "There's a lot of work to do in building a consensus on how to do it and migrating existing technologies onto a new and untested platform."
Chain is among a handful of startups vying to dominate the new field of blockchain technology for Wall Street. Other contenders are New York-based Digital Asset Holdings LLC, headed by former J.P. Morgan &amp; Chase Co. executive Blythe Masters, and San Francisco-based Ripple Labs Inc.
The growing challenge in securely moving assets around the globe is reminiscent of another major event in the markets, the Paperwork Crisis of 1968, according to some industry experts.
At that time, transactions were settled with the delivery of physical certificates. But the volume of trading had risen so quickly that firms were awash in paper. The situation got so bad that the New York Stock Exchange had to reduce trading to four days a week.
To help solve the problem, brokers and exchanges helped create what is now called the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp., a central body that facilitates clearing and settlement for the financial markets. The DTCC says today it clears more than $1.6 quadrillion of transactions a year.
Many of the processes at the heart of the financial system, including some at the DTCC, were built around how to automate paper-based transactions.
"Those processes that came after the paperwork crisis were better, but there is a need now for a more elegant and better solution," said Hans Morris, a former president of Visa who runs a financial technology investment firm Nyca Partners. Nyca has agreed to make an investment in another blockchain company called Clearmatics Technologies Ltd. in the U.K.
Rob Palatnick, chief technology architect of the DTCC, said the appeal of blockchain is its use of cryptography, which he says increases security of transactions and could streamline some of the legacy systems of Wall Street.
"The technology does provide answers to some of the fundamental problems of the financial sector," he said.
The DTCC itself is exploring blockchain technologies and is planning to launch its first pilot project by the end of the year.
"It feels like everything else in the world has gone digital, except money and assets," said Mr. Ludwin of Chain. " That's changing one way or another."

It varies, depending on the card supplier. However within seconds the retailer knows with ~98% (need to check fraud rates) certainty they're getting the money via card. With Bitcoin they must wait for confirmations or talk to enough nodes on the Network to be reasonably certain ( For example, BitPay may wait 30 seconds to check node propagation.
For machine-to-machine transactions, near certainty must be achieved within milliseconds.

Hi, I'm Alistair, co-founder of Sato.sh ... feel free to AMA! :)
@_date: 2016-05-25 09:57:35
I think they've already fixed this
@_date: 2015-10-14 11:56:48
Suggest you talk to SatoshiPoint:

Easy to change, thanks for the feedback!

Wences Casares (CEO of Xapo) believes there are 10million users of Bitcoin @ end 2014 ... and expects 5x in 2015!

Not really what I meant, just a pity it won't help create demand for BTC on the exchanges yet.

Has anyone from Core been in contact? Is this a Bitcoin client coup (i.e. forcing everyone to upgrade to non-Core software)?
@_date: 2015-10-23 19:43:33
Sure, so we are currently paying 5 bits for every upvote received (minus any downvotes). We've made a conservative estimate of what we can make in ad revenue to back this up and make it a fixed amount ... although we expect to make a loss for some time until volume picks up.
We also pay bits (significantly more) for introductions/referrals by members to the site.
The plan is that active members will also receive a 'dividend' payment each month (assuming the site becomes profitable).
We give users 10 free votes per 24hrs.

Some of the outputs made their way back to another cold storage address:

The volume figures are broken - i.e. they count ETH buying with BTC volume in the ETH figure but not vice versa.
CoinMarketCap have simply said they are 'working on' fixing this.

We're not open source at this time, please feel free to contact me!

They plan to switch to PoS in a couple of years, no?

Near record levels of leveraged short positions on Bitfinex, yet the price is pretty stable and leveraged longs are flat. Any move upwards would be amplified by short closing.
Lots of existing investors are topping up at these levels.

How do we know they are not a Ponzi/fraud?

The whole "credit cards are just as bad" argument is irrelevant. Bitcoin can and should be a superior solution in *every* way if we want to see mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2015-11-19 21:16:13
I guess you didn't read the context

+1 for the covert advertising ;)

Clearly we both believe in Bitcoin, but why not improve it to be the best it can be to ensure maximum disruption of the legacy systems? I believe 21 Inc want to enable machine to machine transactions and give merchants the ultimate, instant solution (even better than cash) ... its a good thing, no?

In related news, I run a digital currency fund.
Agree, not a short squeeze ... yet.
@_date: 2015-10-24 10:51:06
We believe so, yes ... there are some significant differences. We aren't a tipping site in the conventional sense.
@_date: 2015-10-03 18:19:42
Agree wholeheartedly! Will be crowdfunding for sato.sh shortly after launch

Indeed, I stopped reading due to this fundamental inaccuracy very early on in the article :/

This is already beta testing at:

Obviously I'm wrong, and that is why the price is now &gt;$250

If ever people needed reassurance that governments are quietly enabling Bitcoin, rather than trying to stamp down on it ... here it is.

This is the beauty/consequence of a permissionless network ... you don't have to win a personality contest to participate.
