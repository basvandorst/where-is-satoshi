Good for you. This works for you because you have a low risk tolerance and good use for your money now. BUT this should not be taken as a lesson for others to sell just because they can realize gains now. The biggest gains are in the future. I accept that the right decision for you was to sell but using the same logic the right decision for me was to buy. Two fundamental concepts you talked about (risk tolerance, time of need for the money) are different for most people. I asked myself do I need the money now and the answer was no. Not for 2-4 years from now. Then my question was how much of my money can I risk losing in 2020 in fiat terms. That was the answer to how much I should invest in bitcoin. These two questions have different answer for different people. For you the answers were: I need the money now and I can tolerate losing only half of what I have invested. Hence your decision was sell while mine was to buy. Both perfectly acceptable because we have different situations.
ps: Thanks for selling because without sellers there would be no bitcoin for us buyers.

Lets keep some prespective here:

Slow: credit card and debit transactions are seconds. But yes Bitcoin is faster for cross border transactions
Energy use: second layer would not affect this. Only value of the coins mined will. 
Expensive: more expensive than debit transactions but cheaper than wire transfers.

I totally agree with you. I didn't want to give the impression that I traded All of my fiat for bitcoin. I think everyone should have a minimum of 0.001 bitcoin and that's what matters. Sadly there are people in the world who don't even own a small fraction of a bitcoin. In my opinion that's dangerous. Every one should own a bitcoin and no one should put all of his/her money in bitcoin.

This is true. People sadly don't understand that Bitcoin could have been farther ahead if there was no gridlock. Sad to see instead of attracting new people to Bitcoin we are losing major contributors.
@_date: 2016-12-14 05:29:41
It is amazing how many people here simply don't understand this. Everyday Bitcoin needs to add features instead of losing them. Instead of moving to faster confirmations, bigger block-size, less centralized mining in China, we are moving towards higher transaction costs, unconfirmed transactions, negative publicity due to network limitations and civil war. We have lost companies that invested heavily in Bitcoin and many users have walked away. We need every single user and company to stay in the ecosystem and make Bitcoin thrive.  
@_date: 2016-12-14 05:22:21
I truly disagree.... Digital currencies are complicated enough for average users to understand already. If mass adoption is our goal Bitcoin should be simple to use, easy to understand, and accommodate all users. Seems as if Bitcoin is losing features instead of gaining new ones. This is a major concern for me and a major segment of current and potential users. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 00:12:00
I second this. The frustration expressed by many companies in this ecosystem is not accidental. It is unfortunate but companies and users dropping out comes at no surprise to me. I had to hedge my bets. Many moved on. Imagine how much further ahead we could have been if there was no gridlock.

@_date: 2016-12-08 06:26:40
It hurts to see instead of progressing things have gotten worse. In 2013 Bitcoin price was over $1000. Had we made the right decisions instead of sniffling progress it should could have easily been worth $2000 to $5000.... Remember when price dropped to $220 in 2015. Thank you block size limit. Many of my friends left cryptocurrencies when they saw all that infighting. Instead if growing the network we have managed to make people leave it. Imagine if facebook purged some of its users just as it was gaining momentum. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 07:12:29
Best way to measure "user count and ease of access", conviction and engagement the said users, is by measuring demand. I wager best way to measure demand would be price since supply is pretty much known. Regardless if you find a better variable than price to measure value of anything in the eyes of the users please let me know. I keep an open mind.

Very good point. That would be a very good way of looking at it.

Isn't their job to secure transactions? Are they offering anything more?

When you send money to a merchant they immediately get your information: name, address, banking or credit information. Bitcoin is more anonymous than fiat. The bank knows all your transactions.

100,000 in a month is smaller than rounding error considering other costs of maintaining the network. Not to mention how many customers are currently priced out due to bitcoins scalability problems. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 19:47:13
I suspect that as well, but the truth is I love BTC. I invested heavily in BTC and have owned BTC for years. 
Regardless of that the cost to maintain the network is staggering. 1 million USD a day is simply too much. I am looking for intelligent comments what would give me and others new insights. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 21:43:45
I am getting tired of people saying blockchain is the next big thing. There is no blockchain without a cryptographic token of value to incentivise miners to support the network. 
I do not see anywhere anyone mentioning how would day go about implementing this grand idea without a digital currency. 
Blockchain was made for digital currency and digital currencies were made for blockchain. You can't have one without the other.

I agree with you with regards to some points, but the main thesis is that Bitcoin is not ready for prime time if hurdles to buy it are so great that someone trying to spend 750 USD worth of BTC is discouraged enough to use credit cards instead.

My response to this was to remove all my bitcoin from all online wallets and exchanges. If they decide to put restrictions on bitcoin they will start by trageting bitcoin held by commercial entities like circle, coinbase, kraken, ...

To my humble opinion increased adoption is the most important factor in for bitcoin. I also think risk of centralization is overstated.

I want everyone to know that Kim Dotcom was convicted of insider selling in Germany. He pumped some stocks while he was selling. He started false rumors about companies he had shares in, etc. He has shown time and again he has no regard for law nor does he follow any moral compass. If you plan to invest with him, make an informed decision. Now a days everyone wants to do a crowd funding using bitcoin.

It's about getting new users in ecosystem. This is not about me. It is about Bitcoin and user expectations. I think you may have missed the point. Also telling others not to use Bitcoins is no way of increasing adoption. Without increased adoption Bitcoin will die.

Would that person need 50.01% of all the coins in circulation? We all know that the moment there is evidence of double spending that coin's market value will drop to zero. Wouldn't this prevent the guy owning half the coins from double spending?

Dude today the same happened to too.
My advise was super simple. Open an account with coinbase or circle.com
If you are investing less than 10 btc just keep them in the wallet. Knowing them if I told them anything more complicated they would have not followed through. They are gonna buy some BTC this week. 
Web wallets are great for beginners with low amount of btc. They will slowly learn more. Don't give them too much to handle, it may be off putting.

In USA it costs $12 a month to have a plain bank account; costs more for extra functions. In some other countries it is free but not every where.

The ones I suggested do online commerce. The reason I suggested these was because I think adoption is easier for online retailers than old school brick and mortar retailers.

Of course this is because there is an increase in demand while supply is relatively stable. In the past few weeks I noticed demand increasing steadily to a point that it slowly sucked up the liquidity in the exchanges. Last week spread between bid and ask were increasing. At times the spread of over 1-2 usd could be seen. 
Now the question is what is driving the demand. Partially china, partially end of the acrimonious debate about block size, partly excitement about Gemini and impending reward size halfing. I believe we are going to see a bull market in 2016 and lots of volatility which may spill into 2015. 
Strap in tight, the roller coaster is getting ready for take off. We won't see stability of 2015 for a long time.

Sure, however you'd think is best. I wanted to see what the community thinks and if they support or disagree with the request. 
At the very least also it would send a message to people who always complain of censorship that there are others out there who prefer more of it to improve bitcoin.
Have a good day. In the mean time enjoy the new high price of btc.

How can one argue that it's not at currency. It was designed to be a currency and works like a currency. It has no similarity to a property. It has not physical existence.

I don't want to argue for the sake of arguing but I have not heard any acceptable from anyone that bitcoin should be considered a commodity. 
The two examples you used barter system and intellectual property are defined within their own parameters. Bitcoin doesn't fit into those. I think your examples are valid but have nothing to do with bitcoin and only convolutes the discussion.

You cannot simplify a complicated issue by blaming the government. Banks follow the same rule yet they are able to provide good customer service. Why doesn't coinbase have a customer service phone line? It's pretty basic. If you care for your customer experience you add a good customer service team.

I think there is a tipping point. Once a certain percent of a local population start using it, bitcoin will spread like wildfire. I remember before anyone started using facebook 5-10% of my university mates started using it. No one else was using it but that core 5% made most of other students join and use facebook. Then highschoolers started using it and the rest is history. With credit cards discover focused on certain cities to get that critical mass. We need high concentration of people in a segment of population or a certain geographical region to start using bitcoin to build that critical mass and reach the tipping point.
