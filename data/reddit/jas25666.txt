By that definition everything is gambling though. Is there a guarantee that you won't get into an accident the moment you step outside your door? Of course not, so by that definition leaving your house is gambling.
Following risk management guidelines (diversification, use a long-term time horizon, be informed) makes investing significantly safer than market speculation (following trends, day trading, etc) which is still safer (albeit still quite risky) compared to actual gambling.

It's not gambling though, if you are diversified and have a plan. If you go into the stock market for the long term (hint, that's the only time frame you should considering for proper investing and not speculation) you can weather such storms.
In fact with dollar cost averaging (a common investing scheme) you usually end up with more units of a stock/fund, which makes buying in such periods advantageous!
The stock markets average about 8 to 9% a year, including the effects of the Great Depression and various recessions. Additionally, a proper investment plan incorporates risk management and tapers down your risk as you get older (ex move away from growth stocks and into more secure dividend stocks, safer-but-with-less-return assets as you approach retirement).

No, proper investing in a diversified portfolio of assets is not gambling.
Investing in one specific, volatile asset (BTC or choosing one stock) and hoping the one asset hits it big is gambling.
