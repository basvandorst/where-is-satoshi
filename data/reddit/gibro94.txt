Thank god the average joe is being put off. Kids should not be saying they're genius day traders in crypto. This will shake all the week hands. Its a transfer of wealth. If average people actually understood the inherent value of only a few of the coins the market would be in the trillions. Decentralized blockchain will revolutionize the world we live in I guarantee that. Which ones will do it, I have no idea.

I think the greed of the community will probably kill Bitcoin's chance of ever being a real store of value and something else will take it's place in the long term.

Who is this 'whale'? And do they own even close to 25%? Why do they want to own 25%? Just because a bank allows people to purchase BTC does not mean adoption? The NY stock exchange is listing BTC supports my original argument. I just think the argument that many are using that BTC was once 'x' amount and is now 'x' amount and therefore it will be 'x' amount by 2025 or whenever is bad reasoning. Especially when the BTC is being opened up to institutions. They don't see BTC as anything more than a speculative asset they can play with. I don't think they seriously believe in BTC as a store of value and they're definitely not using BTC as a blockchain to severe as a financial tool.

Who is everybody? I don't think investors are as interested in Bitcoin as the Bitcoin community thinks. I think they're more interested in shorting it than using it as a financial tool.

I think OP is just saying that selling isn't always a good idea same as holding.

I wonder if Dai would be a better solution to a stable currency that's decentralized?
