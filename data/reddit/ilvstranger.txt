I think i'm more worried that i haven't seen bad news... meaning news regarding bitcoin "death" to complete the bitcoin obituaries...
That worries me more than any TA or anything else.
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:29:32
It could be also their exit scam. Like bitconnect did with its ico...
Also they got around $20 mil funds recently for "advance in  developing better technologies"... hmm

nice meme ��
@_date: 2018-08-13 15:38:28
That's why we need to spot the "no trading zone" for this kind of moments.
And for the moment it is one now.
If i understand right your afirmation regarding consistent edge, yes. That's the point where we should know where we stand. In the low, middle or higher class of traders. With that i mean, even if for us "regular traders" the market is nonsense in this moments and is no clear or consistent edge, somebody is still making money... So, TA or fundamentals in trading is working for them. Somebody wins, others are losing... you got the point.
For me is no trading zone, even if on paper trading i got 80% winning trades. But for now i just consider them lucky ones rather than good ones and still wait for some clear directions and official standings to go "live".
Also, for the moment i'm still holding my thoughts regarding next months direction meaning that:
When most will abandon the idea of bullish direction the surprise will come along with some good standings from regulations and Bakk movements. Who knows if Visa will enter now officially in the market or not... I think october 2018 - feb/march 2019 will show that.
Maybe i will make some posts on steemit too to make my thoughts be there too. It is so much like last year bs and also not in the same time.
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:08:49
lol and when we were kids were not much of this todays bs with pranks and using "child abuse" or "human rights" for every simple things that happen every day.
Also stulid words like "frustration" repeated obsesively from media or facebook addicted readers destroy kids self respect and ability to defend themselves or just to learn what is fun and what could also be dangerous for others.
Only a stupid lame journalist could cry at this kind of photos that is... bad whatever their mind will spill at that moment.
I suppose the kid was laughing there though �� and also could have some ideas for harmless pranks.
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:22:11
I think we should not encourage trollers.
Newbs and the one that are not in crypto should learn first that BTC  is depending on nobody and in the same time to all... if you understand what i mean.
Also to let them know that the main bitcoin domains are poisoned...
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:46:11
Hmmm Roger is in vacation i suppose or he lost inspiration. He should hire McAfee to pump his altcoin too... lol or make it worse... who knows ��
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:46:16
To end fair this discussion, i didn't went that far in thinking about anarchists, communists or other propaganda but again, i understand your meanings and until a reasonable point regarding the system and govs.
My comment is from the view of a simple kid who love to express through this form of art, graffiti. We all were kids and had our moments and were not part of any movement, propaganda or any other form of dissrespect. We just did what we felt without being thugs or criminals or other stupid word that today are related to so many things that are just kids related. I will never believe that a kid is good only if he do only "the right" things that ridgig grown ups think are good... 
Its all about the bondaries of thei actions that are learned only by seeing them. Here is another discussion ...
And one last thing, that overused "damaging state property" is not doing very good to healthy mind especially to kids.
In my opinion, state shoukd take in consideration the common law and stop trying to scare ordinary people to believe that they should be only obedient workers on a plantation.
We are going back to old times but with technology in their advantage (state, govs, reach people that are controling the world). 
Such discussions as we have here should be more about how we can get back our freedom  and just live life, not to be overwhelmed wit debt and consumption society.
That's why i think this kind of actions, like expressing in the public is good for ordinary people that are not living, being only "machines", to see that something else exist besides their ordinary life...
... lol u got my point too i hope  ����
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:23:05
As i said in a comment above/below (you can read it there) lot of movements today are made by bots and not by humans.
As a new traders we must learn to put SL and go to a next trade as a new one.
In this uncertain moments we should just watch and make paper trading just to learn. We should risk low % of our balance and enter when we can justify that trade.
That's the way i learn and try to get rid of sentiments. 
Usually lot of the ones that buy at certain support levels without confirmations i think are newbs. Big traders have their moves planned ahead and waiting for some good signs. They risk too but they have a proper SL and will come back to recover and make more. 
But, in this moments i think is a no trade zone for us with so many "good" news that are not affecting the price accordingly to all we saw until now.
Big investors or whales are playing around with newbs and making money in both directions up or down.
So... don't fomo at any point. Buying when is lower in small amounts it could help in long term. Or make just paper trading. It's your choice.
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:48:23
We had a drop around 3x from 20k to 6k but... we are stilalmost plus 6x from whent it was around 1k last year so it is a matter if how you look at it. We should see the overall picture though.
Regarding those 4 out of top 5 stocks that no longer exist it show us that one made it and if you respect a simple rule of investing you are not puting all your money in only one investment and also lot of people should learn to have a money management, meaning from time to time investors should take out some gains and have a chance to grow the portfolio not to tighten it to have a good risk reward.
And so on... Only holding is not the best rule, it depends on each inestors what timeframe is good for them.
For short term for most of the new peopke who enter in crypto without knowing what they do it means that they are willing to lose that money... nobody is forcing them.
Think then invest, its your money until the end.

@_date: 2018-08-04 22:11:58
We cam try to use more crypto in payments and buy it back when getting home to have same amounts.
There are not many places where we can do that but their numbers are increasing. I think its the onky way to grow this.
I'm loving for the moment using ETH because it has the quickest confirmations and low fees... but i hope will have a chance with others too soon.
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:02:40
Blood in the streets indeed, but it may not be enough "blood" so buying should be spread at the key levels also waiting for some trend confirmations. Next big key support level is 5800-6000 and is not a plac to be all in especially when we are retesting the fourth time.
Something is wrong now and the big whales want to make the newb traders that learned TA basics to have some traps because lack of experience and now all it matters is experience and real cold blood not the one you think you have.
Money management and risk reward plus your chosen timeframe should take place to the dangerous "to the moon" thinking.
Also timing is a key point.
This are the first things we should do.
Now some history is written and we are lucky to live it. It will be a shame to not be part of it and with good memories too.
@_date: 2018-08-04 21:41:48
I usually don't care about lot of news because most of them are just low speculations without real support, big media groups that have incompetent writers who are obliged to write about things that they don't know anything, big manipulative corporations like goldman sachs, coinbase, Roger Ver etc... who just need to make dumb money come or go from the market... etc.
Unfortunately actual system depends on dumb money which in crypto case come through media news almost 100%.
But it is what it is and we must learn to profit from this moments and if possible to make some profits. Or just hodl and go to med/long term with our investments.
The way this meme shows it should happen most of the time, but now history is written for crypto so we just live it and who has good choice now will eatn more in the near future.
First advice is to stay away from cnn, cnbc, sachs news and similar entities. Just wait for big trend movements.
Now it is ETF. Which for the moment is just manipulation without concrete direction. They just made some money before something will happen and lot of strange news come day by day... I think autumn is the first possible start for something or spring 2019 if they will make bs from current situation.

Short answer:
Dumb money and smart money. It will always exist those two sides. Depending on level of information you have, you will trade in your chosen range or sometimes you won't.
Other thoughts:
When you stay away there are other traders that will and so on.
The big whales knows that and will continue to make money as much as they can because almost all the time will be somebody ready to risk their money.
It's all about information you have and where you stand. 
Also, the volumes that lot of people are watching must not be taken in consideration for the regular trader, because it's just noise and so are many indicators now.
I remember of all the things i watched regarding major crisis with stocks and how the smart money have made their exit before some laws has became real and dumb money just hoped that is good to buy the "dip".... and it wasn't... ans so on.
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:56:05
well... Wish you luck!
Also, keep those BTC until you may double them or more and you'll thank yourself more then
@_date: 2018-08-02 22:51:28
From last Roger Ver "big move" when he intentionally tried to scam new people who reads on his website about bitcoin core, we can't expect to nothing else than misleading and manipulation from him.
And when i remember that at my beginning last year, i believed in that website and even in the first videos that i saw Roger ver... he even cried in one video... huh. I thought he is a true girly loving person without being mean. But in the fall i saw his real intentions with forcing payments with bcash at Bitmain and all other bs he came about.
Roger Ver is just a marketing machine and i'm starting to wonder who's puppet he is... Who controls all his cryings in the market. Because its impossible for him to do such a big move alone. He is just a good actor who just distract the people from the main market.
We should all make continuous posts here, on steemit, twitter from time to time to let new people know the real story, that bitcoin dot com is... just another altcoin already and is not representing Bitcoin anymore...
How many of you also have seen that lot of times that they release some news at exactly the weekly candle close, or monthly... and after that the price moved in the direction expressed by that news first released there... I saw that a few times this year when trading... So...
Let's spread this message often for the newbs to let them know!
Maybe make this thread sticky or as hot and ressurect it here from time to time.
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:54:14
Yes, but let's not forget about Star@ and their newly Bakk company.
This should be the biggest news of the year, more than this ETF game which follow the first kids game with futures.
Yes ikn ETF is more real because of real btc movements compared to the futures. But with Bakk it will be more spread among the regular people and should have more impact.
So, november and february are my key moments for now.
I will not be surprised to have a weird pump this fall-winter like the futures one though.

lol... they're out in the city maybe.
This s\*\*t with rumors and inside source/information are so clickbait now and are good only for just price manipulation made exactly by the ones who cries about it...
So, just watch out about all the bs spread around and put in balance technical and fundamental analysis.
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:22:12
It should be the greatest news of the year. Better than etf and any others.
But the market is almost 99% percent manipulated to have our expectations. We see the big downside in last weeks and also rising of btc dominance that killed alt pumps for now.
Somebody will make a shit ton of money really soon. Let's just hope we will be there too ☺
@_date: 2018-08-15 13:08:27
Organic adoption for crypto is not coming with major crisis... That's bs just to make sime news. Coinbase represents us gov and who knows what whales and large investors that only have their gateway to crypto through Coinbase...
In a crisis people would not want to risk their small gains to smth that they don't know. Look now when is the beginning of those crisis how many people lost money and also belief in crypto because in majority it was a wreckless investment without a money management or smth to minimize risk.
Why would they buy crypto when they will need food and money to pay the bills?
I'm pro 100% crypto, but that doesn't mean that all is in crypto... You must have a way to take profits too to live... and so on.
I just hope that lot of people that were making big mistakes until now will not leave crypto and they will take a moment to learn what they do with their money and do better in the future.
Nobody will know what will happen in a crisis time or in major moments in their life.
So, Coinbase go to lick your us dady boss hand and try to be more user friendly than just spreading bs...
Just some sats around from my side ��
@_date: 2018-08-21 14:10:55
It may be until a point. Overall seems it helps but in reality is the best way for us gov to be in crypto more easily. To have access to anything they want and also be able to lock funds etc... Such as Poloniex which is now owned by major names in banking... and so on.
It is somwhere in the middle... the truth.
You must never be 100% supporting any of these. Their support is useless... even if they received hundred of millions to do their business. I think they are worst than Bitmain in lot of things and the mass adoption should not be related to them as being the one... 
In lot of countries they do not allow to have accounts... so, HOW is that mass adoption?

I think they will wait for a drope then they will list it to gain more than this 15-20% rise ��
They learned from bcash that they must not force it too much, but i don't think they are plesed with less than 2x ��
We'll see soon. I think it will go live aug-sep this year though.
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:10:10
yes it works. If you are not to the moon type and accept your stop loss and come back with a new trade when you have trend confirmation.
Also, every trade should be justified and always take it with fresh thinking.
If you are not sure you're not justified to enter. Daily and weekly charts shows the trend not intraday or even hourly... this are just for scalping and pumps. The later ones should be avoided along with most of the signals that are all over the places.
If you analyse D1, W1 and even monthly you should see that lot of things are in their place. Also compare since its begining on charts and look for cycles.
Yes, TA is for small part of us for sure. Correlation, money management and risk reward are the most important things that matter. If a trader has not got that education yet it will go wrong.
I'm not trying to convince you about anything her, just saying that every tool has its users, otherwise it will not exist.
!!! Most important thing - nowadays, human trading is less and less eficient, bots are replacing lot of human trading. That could be a reason for lot of disappointments.
@_date: 2018-08-10 13:44:29
ups and downs + some news make too many people act wrong.
But the markets always need that. If dumb money do not exist then the other side could not make money.
It always has to be somebody to lose for others to win.
We can watch with some popcorn and enjoy the dump then the rise ��
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:19:00
nice meme, hehe
Also, we can say that Mc is the father of the pumps!
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:37:32
We can also buy BTC daily for at least $10 to make accumulation and slowly rise the interest and the price.
The picture you put there is the volume though.
The big rule is to buy constantly to have a better value in time than to buy only once. And sell only in profit, but only to have money for daily life. If the investor needs that. Otherwise, med-long term hodler is the best reward now.
Let's talk more ��
@_date: 2018-06-21 20:57:30
I thought about that, but haven't seen a record for who and why does it.

Thanks a lot

Maybe that will spread around the world to actually be implemented.
@_date: 2018-06-05 13:30:32
It will always be nice when this kind of moments come to chill down the market and make people think at what is really happening.
This way it is a filter to the ones that will lose more money from the hype and not knowing what they are doing, at least it should make them learn.

You know that unfortunately, is not possible to be without some that will be to manipulate it.
I can't wait to see what will happen after all the bitcoins will be mined. What will really happen then when miners will earn only from fees. 
I love that is a small start with steemit platform for writing. But for the moment i don't see another big project working.
We'll live and see.

After december hype, a lot of people entered in the crypto without a clue of what they do.
A chill down is good for stopping people make mistakes and learn what they do.
It is what i feel and seeing that nice picture in your post made me write this.
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:45:49
Every forum or chat is driven by market big moves. Big bad/good news means always money for media or investors (usually the big whales who control thay).
We, the small fish, need to pay attention to that moves.
The sideway movement is a dormant "pump or dump".
So, i'm not surprised by this corelation. 
Also, lot of interest decreaset on the down trend because lot of "investors" were regular people that had no clue whay they were doing. Now they just wait or are out of this market.
But with every moment like that we have few more that remain in the market and we are more.
Let's hope that way we will be able to lower the big manipulation... or just dream about it.
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:41:18
Yes, Coinbase is adding "moon", "err" and "sorry" tokens.
There was inside information that made people buy them as bcash and we'll see a big dck candle soon :-)
I'm sure the coinbase "ERR" token will be a hit!
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:49:51
And to go back where we started \(fiat\)?
It will need to belong to no state and for us to be able to use it.
I am not also a supporter to stick to only one solution. In this case one digital currency. What we do if technology is not working? If we are 100&amp; with tech we can't buy food and current needs.
I can compare with the "you should not be all in in one investment option". I feel the same here too.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:43:27
Overall, i agree with your point. Network effect is on the road and limited supply exist. Satoshi for me, is just a pseudonim for the masses. Of course there is a start point for bitcoin... eh. It is no need for that debate again.
I like your response with good arguments and the big poin is to work. I don't see a reason to not work, but we need to wsit and see.
My point regarding "all in", is if we are linked, dependent to something that work only with technology and internet, how do we buy food and daily thing if those do not work?
In no way i'm against bitcoin, it is just a reaction from todays issues when i could not pay bills because the internet was not working... being one example.
I hope you understand what i want to say and need to see that we have a chance to solve that issue too.
I will listen to what you said to hear new things.
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:40:13
What do you want when now Circle backed by  Goldman Sachs and others. Do you want them to say the truth? 
Maybe a few will have a positive solution for put them in the media and say is good...
They had a strange way to welcome new users without telling them that if they make a small test transaction the amount it will not be seen in their wallets but it will be there. No, only if you try to find on internet what others say you may find out and other things.
I know, for this exchanges it is impossible to handle so much requests. I understand that. But make some public response with this things \+ externalize the chat part. You get hundred of millions and you don't want to do that? But you go and give your data to govs \+ admit all regulations without trying to help both sides \(not only one\) and then you claim you are good...
Uhm, Poloniex and Coinbase are one from the first that will be ruled by "government".
They don't care about small people. They will only when govs will ask them to give info.

He admitted the point where he lost eye contact to the checked bills and that is the point where you don't give them back.
You make your tx with the money in front of you without any other moves. At any suspect thing you check them again. If you are not allowed, you can say goodbye.
Also, his friend should be near him not outside. That's why he was there, to help him not be scammed.
So it is a way to believe that 99&amp; of the trades made that way are a chance to be scammed.

That's facebookers mentality. The herd is doing now kind of similar things.
They just read, click and lot of them believe all the craps they see/read.
That's this era issue. It's not theirs fault because they were born in this time. Their fault it will be when they'll see real thing and they'll avoid it because if facebooker mentality of read/click/believe because it's easier than to check what they'll believe the rest of their lives.
As the movie idiocracy, we are kinda going in that direction for now.

If its nice design and made in a clean place like that one it is not offensive / polluting / damaging... 
I don't see that wall falling because the weight of the graffiti ��, or hurting smbd. Lots of places looks better with nice "redesigns"...

The tru' meaning of:
"That's what she said!"

I understand your point of view and i agree with the common sense.
But i'm not so sensible at this things because it is a bit harmless. Yes it is not ok to be on the front of the nice building or of the house. But as i see there is just an old ugly wall that looks better that way. And there are a lot of walls that are ugly asf that they will deserver a good grafity.
And passing over the bad language there, it is a reaction to lot of bad moves from the gov's. In many countries governments and big public institutions are not working for their people, they are just want to make them consumers without any rights. Today is happening more than ever.
Also, why the state is alloud to place their "graffiti" in any commercial and also on your property when they want and how they want and people are not allowed to express theirs?  
It's kind of a chain reaction.

If crypto is around that time, and it looks that will be,  i don't think selling will be an option to current payment option. Also if it will hit that bigger value from today speculations, above 500,000, other currencies will ceise to exist. Te whole economy will be completly different and it will not report to usd or other fiat.
As a way of thinking though, is a healthy one excepting sell... maybe just enjoy life if you held enough.
Cheers
