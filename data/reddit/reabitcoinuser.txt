No, I don't buy bitcoins. I accept them as payments. I don't sell bitcoins for fiat. I use them to purchase things. I can't be the only person around here doing this.


But the ones that do, boy, it's such an easy and convenient way to spend money on them.

Well, I would be in it for the cheques, except those are so laughably obsolete when we have bitcoins.

Paypal doesn't work internationally very well. You have to deal with exchange rates and wait times to get the funds in or out of paypal. I don't know if Google wallet is better, but I doubt it.

Yes, agreed! You're the kind of person I was looking for.

How about people who want to trade goods and services using bitcoins? Or settle debts using bitcoins? What's the subreddit for that?

Everyone loves freedom. Who the hell doesn't want to have freedom? Wanting freedom is not the same as whatever it is people say when they start talking about Ayn Rand or whatever other thing they call "libertarian".

Most of the servers that are ultimately holding the ledgers in banks are not internet-connected... and they are still using COBOL.

So when I go to Wikipedia and I read about libertarianism, the first thing it defines is "a skepticism of government authority." I don't have this at all. If the government wants to regulate bitcoin, go right ahead. I actually *like* paying taxes, I like the idea that we get together as a society, pool some resources, and use it to build stuff that benefits everyone. I like most things about the government. I don't think our society can function without government except at tiny scales.
I don't identify with almost anything that people mean when they say "libertarianism".
This isn't a mathematical definition, since every person means something slightly different when they say libertarianism. If just wanting to send money around without needing but not necessarily conscientously avoiding government intervention is libertarian, then I guess I am one, but I don't have anything against the government.
Hell, I want to *help* the government here, get some work off its hands.

The ATM isn't ultimately holding the ledger that says how much money there is in the bank.

Well, the advantage I see over fiat is that it's inherently internet money. I find it frustrating how clunky it is right now to use money on the internet.

No, it's a post about wanting to use bitcoin as currency. I want it to be used as currency. The IRS was right to not classify it as one, because most people are not using bitcoin as a currency, but as a commodity to speculate with.

Can't I call that fiscal anarchism or something else? I don't feel a lot of affiliation for the self-entitled antisocial egotists who call themselves libertarians.

I realise that we need speculators for now and we will always need miners (who some day in the far off future will just be called "accountants"). But I can't be the only one who is here not in it for the speculation. I'm just looking for kindred spirits who are not, right now. I can't be the only one out there.

I have bought books on Amazon with gyft, domain names, a VPS, some VPN access, an e-book, and bought a meal at a local restaurant for the novelty of it.
I have received bitcoins for giving online tutoring.

I'm here looking for people who also just want to spend and receive money and nothing else. I'm tired of the speculators. I don't identify with them.
As for coinbase and blockchain, I don't trust anyone them to take care of my money, nor do I have a need for them. Multibit and Electrum work just fine for me.

Thanks, maybe I should hang out there instead of @_date: 2014-04-07 18:45:03

What's the book about?
@_date: 2014-04-07 19:17:08
Yes! This is exactly what I want.
