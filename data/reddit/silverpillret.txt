There is a capital gains tax in Sweden, yes. 30%.

I don't quite get what you are saying. But yes, we pretty much should pay capital gains tax for everything. I could buy some USD, go on vacation to the US and then go back to Sweden. If I have any USD left and the exchange rate has gone up, I should, in theory, pay a tax on the gains I've done. No one really does this though, and there's no way for Skatteverket to know that I've made small gains like that.

30% capital gains tax. 30%-55% income tax. 25% VAT. 100% energy tax. 100% carbon dioxide tax.

Thanks. That's the only exception though.

Vad är det du tycker är oprofessionellt med Kapiton?

It's not consistent, but it is a regular phenomenon. Last week, Sunday morning to Sunday evening (US time), the price on Mt.Gox went from $298 to $217. That's a 27% dip.

I don't think we will. My gut feeling is that this will be the last spike before a $100 dip, just like the one we saw a week ago. **The good 'ol weekend dip is back.**
