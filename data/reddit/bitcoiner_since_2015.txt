Wtf?! Why you saying that here? You drank too much kool-aid!

Nonesense. There is no problem! If you want to make transactions, just use litecoin. BTW, we should support lukejr's 300kb blocks proposal. I think its a brilliant idea.

Wtf why do you want that? Its too dangerous! We should support Luke Jr instead about his 300kb block size. Its more safe and sensible.

Ouch. Obviously this merchant doesn't know anything about the current situation.

Just call them with derogatory names to provoke them. Always effective.

I first bought 1 BTC for only $300+ way back 2015. I have an old reddit account but long forgotten the password so i made a new one. What's your problem? :-)

I'm also thinking of moving to Gemini. BTW, how do we move our btc to Gemini?

Ramsay, a world renown chef, doesn't like pineapples as toppings. He literally pukes it on national TV once.

Because its just a test.
