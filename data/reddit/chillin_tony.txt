How are we gonna get bigger adoption with those fees? I am asked by friends to give them bitcoin to try and I am ashamed because I can't do it.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:57:01
No Nappa, no we're not.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:55:58
This is the one!
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:34:06
A POKEMON!

Even more likely response:"You're fired."

When people want their money, they don't really think that far.
@_date: 2015-07-03 22:10:57
Well, the main effect is that nobody accepts credit cards at the moment, with the exception of large chains. If you want groceries or gas, you have to pay with cash. Reason is, if they accept your credit card, they won't be able to restock, plus they are afraid of losing the money.
Apart from that, you can use the ATM's to get 60€ daily (which is effectively 50€ now, as the ATM's are out of 20€ notes), which is enough to cover for food. Also, tourist cards are unaffected by the measure so living in a tourist area helps!
Thanks for the tip!

I'm sure many people do exactly that.  Ypu can see the potential, but you still doubt it.

Yes, I live in Greece at the moment. I am not aware of any such gatherings, but then again I haven't really done a search.

Pm sent.
@_date: 2015-07-03 21:14:40
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-07-03 22:02:26
Wow, believe it or not, I was not aware of this!
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:52:19
Believe it or not, I think that overall they are not bad for Bitcoin. They provide free advertisement. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 10:42:18
Agreed,  thanks for the tip! 
@_date: 2015-07-04 10:44:42
Thank you! 
@_date: 2015-07-04 10:53:52
No downvote from me, I realize it can sound like one.
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:24:10
I do, but that is a little extreme. Just learned that there is a Bitcoin ATM in Athens though, so I am probably gonna use that.
@_date: 2015-07-03 22:23:23
Well, the Bitcoin economy is not yes developed enough for lots of earning opportunities to exist. But still, it is a good idea.
@_date: 2015-07-03 22:50:50
Thanks!! I'll make sure to pay this forward!
@_date: 2015-07-03 21:05:50
There will probably be a coalition goverment with the participation of all the parties, in order to try and stabilize the situation.
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:11:55
My father was never interested in it, telling me that it is an obvious pyramid. Today, he asked me for details....
@_date: 2015-07-03 20:59:47
Even if there are riots, nothing will happen. It's the way the system works, the money simply does not exist, so it can not be given.
@_date: 2015-07-03 21:19:16
I agree with that. But, there is one more aspect of Bitcoin ownership than just having it sit in a PC or mobile, and that's spending it. That really gets the market going after all.
@_date: 2015-07-03 22:54:18
Well no, things have not gone that far seeing that capital controls are active for only 5 days. However if the situation continues, I can see that happen in big cities, though I suspect it is going to be illegal to do so.
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:09:35
Awesome! Where is this located? I will be in Athens next week.
@_date: 2015-07-03 22:21:23
[Many people did]( but most believe that keeping cash under your pillow is not exactly a solution.
@_date: 2015-07-03 22:55:24
Many people do exactly that, or pay on delivery.
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:27:40
Nothing I can think of right now, but if I have an idea I'll let you know.
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:55:24
Agreed, sometimes you just have to accept your losses. Thanks for the tip, you're awesome!
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:40:55
Unfortunately, most people reject it outright as a scam or pyramid. And the shape of the price chart does not help either.
@_date: 2015-07-04 10:44:25
@_date: 2015-07-03 21:41:52
Well yes, it could very well be a method to sway the public opinion. Most people realize that, but it is still extremely effective.
@_date: 2015-07-04 10:46:04
I will,  you are awesome! 
@_date: 2015-04-22 00:13:21
Well, this must be really tiring for you.
