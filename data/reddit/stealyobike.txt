Nah...around 3am my time is when I usually see a lot of trading happening. I'll be up watching the charts like a hawk around then.

Why not publicize a list of merchants? I think that categorizing merchants by the types of products they sell and capitalizing on the fact that Shopify accepts Bitcoin would definitely benefit consumers, the merchants, and Shopify. It's a win-win-win.  I don't know about everyone else, but I'm eager to try and buy things with Bitcoin from smaller retailers and wish there was a website that would make it easy to browse different online businesses that accept it.

How convenient of that to happen when the price just dropped from ~750 to below 550 now.

Anyone know where to find a list of Shopify merchants?

The fact that they had a discounted PS4 is definitely a red flag. Definitely suspect it was a scam based on that alone.

Definitely consider bringing the public marketplace back. I looked through the Facebook page and a few pages of the blog, and honestly, I thought the content was catering more towards business strategies for for the retailers and not doing much at all to promote interest in products you can get through Shopify. There are over 70,000 merchants, so only a very small percentage of businesses are going to ever be featured through the blog or Facebook. I think that a directory for the businesses, and having a section for featured businesses would benefit everyone. I will be checking the blog out and hope there are some interesting businesses and products featured :)

Thanks for those links. The Instagram page is very useful and I already see a few things I'm interested in!
