Hm? Did something happen?
Didn't notice.

Bought .1. I now own a whole coin. :)

I have ~ .5 BTC ... feeling like I've missed out a bit. ):
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:44:47
Ah yeah, no doubt. Been there as well. It's all about the long game for me though. HODL!

Just buy. $6k will look like chump change in a few months.
Kicking myself for not buying in aggressively at ~$2k because I thought it was going to peak there. That was in June.

This crypto stuff is in its infancy. Nobody is too late at this point.
No expert, just my opinion.

All entirely possible and worth taking into consideration. Again, not an expert. I just take a simple approach - never invest more than you're willing to lose. Just be aware of the risks and act wisely.

The miners are still needed for verifying transactions, of which they receive a cut of the fees.

The expectation is that the price stabilizes at which point we should all feel more comfortable buying pizza with it. I think in the short term we are in the hoarding phase of crypto.

Bought some at $7,444. feelsbadman
