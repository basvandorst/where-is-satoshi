How about if it's not?  So if I spend the coins from computer1, do they magically still exist on computer2?  If so, doesn't that mean that by copying my wallet, I have doubled my bitcoins?
Surely this is not possible, so I'm having trouble understanding what happens to a wallet's coins as it gets duplicated.

So my next question is - why?  Why didn't you just use your normal currency?  Buying something in USD seems always to be cheaper than buying with BTC at this stage.
What are the advantages to using BTC over fiat currency for normal, legal items?

Will do

Is that also the case with computer hardware?  How about just ordering with paypal on ebay?  Doesn't that work out cheaper and easier than using BTC?
Whatever the case, it's good to hear people are actually using it as a currency.  If everyone is buying it to hoard, then it's not serving it's purpose, and will eventually crash.

That's a good idea.  Which site/hub do you access them through?  And is there an option built into the site to pay them with BTC, or it's arranged with the individuals directly?

I don't suppose you have a similar suggestion for litecoin?  So far as I can see there is no blockchain.info wallet equivalent for litecoin?  Therefore where would you send your litecoin mining rewards?  Is sending them directly to the offline wallet a bad idea?

Got it, thanks for the explanation!
