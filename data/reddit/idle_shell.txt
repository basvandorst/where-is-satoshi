No. Polk County. Bartow is the county seat. There is a state citrus dept bc citrus crop is a big deal im Florida. Hence a government agency that aids farmers and regulates the industry. 
Source: my family has grown citrus in central Florida for 50 years.

If nothing else you've done an impressive amount of research. The approach of iteratively testing and expanding resonates with me--just don't have as much land with which to work. And yes I was asking about the residential system originally but appreciate the other detail. 
Love the DIY spirit.

How'd you work out the permitting on that install at your place in SD?  It's electrical work and adding panels to a roof. In Southern California. I can hardly imagine a more restricted environment from a building ordinance perspective. Now on you farm I totally get where you're coming from. 
Somewhat related: how's your part quality from Chinese suppliers been?  I'm not trying to imply that domestic suppliers are better--I just might have more direct recourse with them if parts aren't up to spec.  I'd hardly expect a turn key solution via Alibaba. However as you said in an earlier post, nailing your parts for building at scale is key. Seems like lots of trial and error to get to workable configurations when you have to wait for a literal slow boat from China. Or am I reading too much into your remarks?
Overall, badass.

Assuming relative seismic stability and a decent water source, you sound set. Worst case you to deal with satellite internet.
Dumb question: you mentioned earlier an all DC system. So do you have inverters or converters for certain areas of your operation to support ac electronics--pc, appliances, etc?

"20' shipping container homes..."
Have you posted about that yet? Or point to some interesting links?

Good Luck!

Pardon the continued prying and my relative lack of knowledge--just fascinated by your setup. For those areas that require ac power do you run an inverter at the point of use, or something larger capacity to serve multiple points of use?
