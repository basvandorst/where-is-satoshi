If you think that is bad take a look at what Japan is doing. They make USA Seem like amateurs at money printing.  The BOJ is still buying the stock market any day it's down at the lunch break even though stocks are at 35 year highs!

"Right now it's too difficult to do those scripts, but that's an engineering problem just a few rounds of incremental innovation away" - Andreas
This is a very difficult problem to solve and if you read the Bitcoin paper it calls for "Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse".

yea I understand how smart contracts and multi-sig transactions are going to solve the problem of returning your amazon.com product, etc. but the idea I was really honing in on is transactions that have already been broadcast to the network. So if my bank account is hacked and someone does a wire transfers my money to another account (braodcast to the network). There is a good chance the financial institution can reverse that transaction. 
I understand there is a price we pay for that in terms of speed, higher transaction costs, higher fees (insurance premium). 
But when we think about the mass adoption of Bitcoin, or whatever future crypto exists, you have to understand that not everyone is going to have done the research. People who know less about the technology and security are going to be heavily punished, and I dont really see a future engineering solution to that problem.

please link me to a discussion about how a decentralized application plans to protect its holders from unauthorized (or erroneous) transactions that have already been broadcast to the network. 
I would be very curious to learn more about how people are thinking about this problem.

I'm aware of multi signature transactions being held in an "escrow" type state, but im pretty sure there is no way to reverse a transaction once it has been broadcast to the network. So if mistakes or stolen bitcoin that have already been broadcast to the network are irreversible. Correct me if im wrong on that
