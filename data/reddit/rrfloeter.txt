Hmmmm in started crashing in the late 10s/early 20s I wonder what could’ve caused that ��

The government doesn’t make money people!!  J.P. Morgan has a stake in the fed, the fed prints money, they have direct interest in fiat currency. Y’all are chumps if you think this is relevant to the discussion

Using federal reserve notes that has a board of governors full of bankers. It’s all the same people

I am skeptical as to the asset this could be to the crypto community. I say that because it seems that Rubin and Peterson are looking to go off and create there own version of Patreon - I do however think that with increased censorship on platforms such as YouTube and the residual effects it has on payment platforms such as Patreon, PayPal, etc Crypto could swoop in and be the saving grace. 
I guess we'll see though.

Sure but if they just create there own platform they might just abandon the idea of accepting crypto. A lot of high profile content creators already accept bitcoin.

No they aren’t. They aren’t even banned from Patreon they are just abandoning it to make there own platform “in the name of free speech”
It’s a cash grab and a smart one at that. You play gate keeper and leverage the platform they have that’s great.
Only Sargon of Akkahd is banned from patreon and his platform is not as big as Rubin or Peterson

It’s as good as any other marginal news of adoption but it’s not the big step we need. If we see a major player in the YouTube world get banned completely and leveraged crypto as their means of survival that would be a big change

CFA's don't do advising they do analytics.  Go with CFP's instead.

It's not make or break and it is very very possible that no progress is made this year.  I would honestly expect and kinda hope for stagnation and a lull year where prices don't fluctuate to much. Proof of stability could be the catalyst to mass adoption in 2020.
