Most of the volume isn't weed sales on that site. Weed is just the most popular of hundreds.

Yeah i2p is still not even remotely close enough to go mainstream. It's still stuck at the technical level of Linux users when it comes to this. That's easily it's biggest issue. And in fact it's why I don't use it: Lack of ease, high amount of user required input, and lack of documentation.
I'll be honest, I don't really know too much on the nitty gritty about it. What I do know is that it's WAY faster than Tor, and much more like the regular internet once you get going.
Basically, once you do get it up and running, you can create a whole new online identity that you only use with i2p and essentially be completely safe. Because unlike tor, it requires you to use a whole system wide configuration. Not only that, but URLs are much more natural. For instance OpenBazaar can be accessed at darkmarket.i2p just like any other site. It also has p2p shared storage and hosting built in, somehow.
That's literally all I know about it though. I still have no idea why it's far faster. And I still have no idea why they don't feel the need to use hashed URLs like Tor (or even why Tor requires them in the first place). All I know is that security experts recommend i2p over Tor as the future.

It's pretty spammy considering all he's doing is passing out a fraction of a cent that has very little real value.

Well you were basing your argument on weed, and I was just saying that weed isn't as big of a deal on the market. Sure, you can get weed easily on the streets, or even legally in 4 regions. But there is still a far larger market for other drugs than weed that will still use the service.

You don't have to use he/she... Seriously. This is bitcoin. We all know it's a guy. You aren't going to hurt anyone's feelings by being gender sensitive. Luckily this is still a male space where no one gets offended when you get their gender wrong.

We have a representative democracy because our founders realized its just too difficult to expect everyone to be concerned and active about everything in government when they have lives to live. So we hire someone to do it for us. For instance, most people think speed limits on the interstate are way too low. However society doesn't want to be bothered with phoning in their rep for every little thing they disagree with or want.

has the documentation. I just don't know exactly where to look for you. Sorry

Yeah, it's highly technical. But basically it's a P2P ran service which was inspired to how bitcoin works in transferring updates to the blockchain. 
I don't know how much you know about dark coin, but darkwallet works like that, just by piggy backing on the bitcoin protocoll. So it brings the features of darkcoin directly to bitcoin. 
darkcoin works by hiding transaction amounts and who and from those amounts were going to. It's hard to simply explain but basically as it is now, the blockchain records A sent 1 coin to wallet B. Wallet B now has that coin, and wallet A has one less coin. And that's all public record. With darkcoin, basically they essentially encrypt your message of how much and two whom you are sending coins to by sending every transaction going on in that moment to a central pot and then redistributing it. It essentially works like a tumbler works now, but it's built into the protocol. They keep the amounts sent and received secret through some tricky key encryption algos, that make it so the network only knows the total sum of the coins that are being transferred at the moment, and who's sending them, who's receiving them, but you don't know the exact amount each individual is sending and how much.
darkwallet essentially does the same thing with bitcoins, by allowing others who have a darkwallet to do exactly what darkcoin has built in directly. It's sort of like saying, "Hey we are going to take 100 bitcoins, but we are going to trade them separately within our network." So all the bitcoin blockchain knows is that there is 100 coins being used in this mysterious darkwallet fork. And coins are free to enter and leave this network as much as they like.
Again, it's really complicated and I wish it wasn't. I'm sure someone else could say it better. 
EDIT: Actually now that I think about it I do have a better explanation of darkwallet:
Imagine the bitcoin network as a circle. And within that circle everything is tracked. Now within that circle there is another circle, the darkwallet circle. This circle has it's own protocol that exists ontop of the bitcoin protocol. Basically the outer circle has no idea at all what's going inside this circle. Why? Think of it this way. You send money into this new protocol. And once you do, it exchanges your one bitcoin for one "darkcoin" at 1:1. Then you trade your darkcoins within this network in a hidden fashion like I said before. Then when you want to take your coins outside of the darkwallet network, the network takes your darkcoin, destroys it, and then gives you a bitcoin it's been holding onto from someone else that came into the network before you left.

No no no.  Think of it like this in very simple terms. Imagine the service has 10 chunks of code. Those 10 chunks are split up to 100 people so 10 people each have a copy of the same code. So if LE finds an owner of that one chunk of the code and take it down, no big deal since 9 others have that code. So all the traffic does is reroute around that node that was taken down and instead just uses the other 9. 
So you're not hosting, say, a single vendor on your node, your just hosting, say, 1/3 of the review protocol, or 1/100th of the encrypted storage base. Since you're just hosting a tiny slice of something bigger, you really aren't hosting anything functional at all.

OpenBazaar goes over I2P which is another, more efficient anonymous network similar to Tor but is far better (for instance, none of this hashed URL crap). The only problem is you have to do a system wide configuration, unlike Tor which can be standalone. 
So I don't see the issue here. The nodes are still anonymous, as far as we know.
Also bittorrent doesn't undermine Tor anonymity, it's just recomended not to use it because the network is already congested enough as it is, and no one wants you downloading 1gb files over a network that struggles to deliver 10kbs as it is. Just get a VPN in Iceland for that crap.

If Apple had a way to get 1/3 of the transaction, it would probably allow it. However, at the moment, BTC is not only difficult to do this with, but also not on their list as something they want to integrate into their platform.
Also, Apple does have a right to that 1/3. They developed a platform for you to sell your products/services on. At the moment, unless you expect a nearly trillion dollar corporation to bend over backwards for BTC, they aren't really doing anything wrong.

I agree... If you're in it for the long haul, no worries. However, traders need to be worried.

Would you call those that have 10,000s of BTC from mining greedy? I mean, a lot of them are making a whole lot of money now.

As of right now there is a crash happening. All the sites aren't updating after tons of BTC was being sold off. It went from 95 btc to about 86 in the matter of minutes, then MtGox probably triggered it's flash crash safety trigger. 
Edit: Now at 83.... Thank God I got out before the burst! I sold at 92.1

They are all still on backorder. Probably because BTC is so valuable right now, and they rather use them to mine, then ship them out.
