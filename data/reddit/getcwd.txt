My vote is Bittrex. They're US-based and their employees have real LinkedIn pages. The issue I heard about recently was that they froze some non-US accounts and claimed it had to do with verification.
HitBTC hides everything. They've taken funds from selected customers and only a few issues have been solved:

For 0% fees, use GDAX.com (Coinbase login):
1. Transfer $10 from bank account (1 week delay)
2. Limit buy $10 worth of BTC (nearly instant)

Add HitBTC to the Mt. Gox list. They selectively take customers' funds, make false promises, then nothing happens:

Install Google Authenticator on your phone, enable 2 factor on Coinbase, then move it to their Vault. Later you can move it to a Trezor.

It looks like HitBTC is going to be the next Mt. Gox. Never deposit or trade there! They selectively take customers' funds, make false promises, then nothing happens:
Their graphs can be referenced while trading on a trusted exchange.

For legal recourse, only trade using trusted exchanges preferably located in your home country.
Take the complaints others seriously because it could happen to you:

Please do not recommend HitBTC to anyone:

Beware of discount IOTA for BTC trades. The scam is that they trade IOTA and act like it's worth MIOTA (millions of IOTA).

This scammer tries to trade IOTA and act like it's valued as MIOTA (millions of IOTA) to get your BTC. Run away.
