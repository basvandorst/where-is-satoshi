Arbitrageurs will step in either way. Futures too high relative to spot? Sell them and buy spot? Spot too high? Sell it and buy futures.

Electricity is more volatile than BTC and there have been electricity futures for almost around two decades.

There is no horse or rider. Gemini = 16K and CFE (CBOE) = 16,200? Buy Gemini @ 16,000 and sell CFE (CBOE) futures for equal amounts Participate in the Gemini auction on the day of futures expiration as a price taker and you've locked in the arb.
The same forces are at work in the stock market. If the index futures get out of whack relative to the underlying indicies, arbitrageurs step in to bring things into line and are paid for doing so.

* CME goes down for maintenance daily from 4-5 PM central.
* CME doesn't trade every day, it's M-F only. 
* CFE (CBOE) settles against the Gemini auction price
* CME futures will settle against the BRR.
* CME futures begin on Sunday, 12/17 , not 12/18.

Ah OK understood. I didn't know if I was just missing it. Good luck with your venture. Thanks again for the gold!!

First time I've gotten reddit gold. Thanks!
Check out [this]( image. It appears the BTC character you're trying to use isn't coming across like it should. I'm using firefox. A similar thing occurs in chrome.

People will move to other exchanges because anyone with big money realizes what a joke Mt. Gox is. No other equities/futures/options exchange has regular lags like this. 
Also, the exchanges don't set the price, the participants do.

They are not a financial institution. They don't borrow from the Fed window. They are not FDIC insured. Not a financial institution.

You mean over 10K? No, there should not be a hold. At least that was the case with a business account with RBC. Also, if you wanted to be a little more clear with your wire language, I would consider the following change (your call of course)


Did you see the message earlier inquiring about where completed orders can be found?
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:44:18
You're way out of your league here, pal, trust me. Prove to me that the person who initiated the trades **BOUGHT** at 178.53999 and **SOLD** at 172.10.

Oh but it wasn't. The government views this this as manipulation. I can give several examples, [this]( is the first that comes to mind though. In this example, ICE contracts settle against NYMEX prices for natural gas, so the trader just sold a bunch of NYMEX contracts and pushed the price down, which benefited his even larger trades on ICE. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:39:21
Yeah, there is. You can't do it for an hour, but with a custom interface, you sure can.

Trader here as well. I think that is possible, but the issue is the reliability of the exchange. With 60% of the orders on Mt. Gox, the delays are simply unacceptable. I don't think you'll see any prop firms come in with substantial money until the reliability of the exchange can be addressed. The lag that you see on Mt. Gox is reminiscent of the pit.

Very profitable is relative. Interest rates suck now.

Why is the ask on the left, and the bid on the right? I understand that amateur BTC exchanges do this, but in real life, any front end trading platform lists bids on left, offers on right. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:35:06
You people kill me. Tell me how you know that it was losing money? How do you know it wasn't, I don't know, making money? The truth is, you can't know unless you a) own the account or b) are at the exchange
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:43:22
I hope you used protection! Haha.
Unless I'm missing it, I can't see a list of my completed orders.
Also, when you go to sell, the text says "Min buy price" , when it should say min sell price.

Area at the top of each page where your balance is located, states "CDN funds balance" . The rest of the site uses the ISO standard "CAD". I feel as though it should be "CAD funds balance" . My opinion though.
On the withdraw page, it states that a withdrawal of more than 10k USD will be delayed. I realize that USD is the worlds reserve currency, but it seems as though it should be in CAD, to remain consistent with the rest of the site. (Of course the difference is negligible now because they're near parity, but you get my point).
Also, I believe that you should warn people that funds will be wired in CAD, and explain that if they don't have a CAD denominated account, their bank will exchange it, and they will get raped on the exchange rate. Yes, the person requesting the wire should know this, but not everyone does.
Also, 2 weeks is a pretty steep wait. Just curious what the logic behind this is.

Agreed, price differentials be manipulation, benign market activity, or non-transparent aspects. For example, there's a reason Gox is so much more vs. the other exchanges. People arb between exchanges all the time, there is nothing wrong with that.  If I can buy gas on NYMEX and sell it on ICE for .01 more, than I've locked in profit (you still need to do a TAS transaction on NYMEX to flatten completely, but I wont' delve that far). The question is whether your activity in 1 market is benefiting your position in another, and to what degree. These $1 transactions that are referenced can be considered "painting the tape" as well.
