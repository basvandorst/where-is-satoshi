why is doge a scam?

That's precisely what I'm wondering. It's gaining popularity so fast that it may well continue increasing in value until everyone uses it. Or it could collapse brutally

What about litecoins? They're worth a pretty penny now and they coexist with btc
in a way, altcoins are like metals: gold has no value unless enough humans say otherwise. So do silver and copper etc

just wait until someone finds a way to widespread it and make it more accessible. It's like internet and computers at their beginning I think

That's why I'm not ready to do it. But I'm interested in buying some and at least start to use it a bit to see what it's like and how it all works.
But I still think this is a true revolution coming

I won't lie, when I saw how much value it gained over the years, I wished I had invested $20 in it in 2009. And so I'm interested today in investing a bit in altcoins to speculate.
But apart from that, the more I read on the subject, the more I realize how cryptocurrencies may well be the future of our financial system and what kind of cataclysm / radical change it could become for the world. I'm also afraid of security matters tho

the general public won't pay a "tax": regardless if they buy $10 worth of bitcoins or $10 worth of dogecoins, they'll still be able to use both of them to buy $10 worth of something

By hard evidence I meant good analyses based on facts (maybe articles made by people better informed than most of us idk)

What if it becomes mainstream? Then the value would surge wouldn't it? A meal at a restaurant could end up costing a few satoshis?

Is it even reliable? How much of the world's economy is currently in bitcoins? With .05% of the worlds economy in btc and 1% used for transactions, I get $185000/btc, that's crazy

I do my own research! But I can never hear too many different opinions
