What wallet did you send them too? I use Jaxx will that support the Wax tokens?

I’ve read the blog and I’m still a little confused. If both chains survive I’ll have both coins but if only one chain survives I’ll have that coin... how does a chain completely disappear? 
I really liked how the bCash stuff worked after the last fork and I fully understood the info in the blogs about that before it happened.

Thank you for posting such an informative video.

If after a few days they are following the S2x chain and BTC still exists would they give us access to move the real Bitcoin to a different wallet?

Thanks. I’m new to the ICO ether world. Did some reading as I think I got it sorted.

So you are saying leave the coins on Bread (or any wallet) alone until the dust settles and then see how the chips have fallen. I’m so confused but all the conflicting info. I’m worried I’ll end up with S2x altcoins and no access to my original bitcoins.

How is mBTC pronounced??

Where will I be able to but BTC post S2X attack safely to make sure I'm buying the correct coin? Don't feel I can trust CoinBase?

I finally sold last week for BTC... probably that’s why it’s gone up.

It comes from this drunk rambling comment on a bitcoin forum. Quirky and adopted as part of the bitcoin vocabulary. Some people say it means ‘hold on for dear life’ also.

That's the first time I've seen that list. Wow crazy quantities!
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:54:01
New to bitcoin. Could you explain this further? 
@_date: 2017-05-04 14:09:51
Yes please expand. New and this is the first I've seen this idea.

It's quite responsible to decrease your debt. If that is the right thing for you then great! Now you can slowly and responsibly build back up to where you were before without the credit card debt. I know it's deferent but I wouldn't be investing in any other emerging technology or currency if I had large debt... but that's how I play it. Others have a different risk profile and that works for them.

I'm trying to figure this out too as a new user of bitcoin. This article was helpful.
