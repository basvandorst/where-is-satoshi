LOL 25k? It'll hit way more than that. "Another correction that'll test 9k". Looks like another bs article by this site trying to cause panic so they can buy cheap coins lmao. Downvote this crap!
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:52:38
Ah, i see. Thanks! 
P.s: Do you happen to know if their quoted prices are fair compared to other exchanges? They seem to be a bit lower that livecoinwatch. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:47:59
Yes, I understand but as far as coinbase goes, has there been any steeling issues etc with coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:29:36
or you're just a short term flipper dying to get out of your boring engineering job milking people who don't understand the concept of investing correctly. I'm still up by a lot so i wouldn't speak so surely about what other can or cannot understand, dumb ass. People have committed suicide for selling businesses/investments way too early which have grown into multiples of what they cashed out at. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:01:35
Great, thanks for the help.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:43:24
Is it safe to store my btc on coinbase? and is it ok to send from one exchange directly to coinbase? (assuming that's possible) 
Also, is coinbase legit as far as quoting the right prices? It's seems to be lower by a couple hundred dollars vs livecoinwatch.

LOL so true
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:06:08
They're using bots probably lol

This guy is obviously still a slave lol poor fuck hates being interviewed and clearly shows...poor guy I feel bad for the guy lol he’s the definition of a peasant lol
@_date: 2018-08-01 07:31:52
I feel like we've become dogecoin lol
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:36:00
Indeed. =(

Are mods putting these bullshit articles on front page?
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:41:54
Knew it! Even that idiot youtuber MoVlogs has a video claiming he lost 100k in bitcoin! Funny part is in the previous video where he claimed he invested in bitcoin, he said he only invested 10k LOL. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:58:42
EXACTLY! I can't believe it isn't being done already and the fact that this post has been downvoted. Shows even the mods are in on the flipping. We need another subreddit.
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:38:12
Whoever it's from it's delaying my retirement plan god dang it.

Someone capable of organising protests against media companies/banks please do so. It's very obvious the media companies are being controlled by banks. These protests need to be organised in bank headquarters etc and media outlets to prevent them from entering their workplace. I understand they can probably operate online but it should still make a positive impact and help get the TRUTH out and stop using their services! 
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:33:15
Isn't this old news? Seems like an attempt to slow the current growth.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:53:57
Movlogs was also paid.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:08:17
China and india are a fucking disease but this is good news. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:49:36
That's the plan but the sooner I can retire the better lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:37:25
Doesn't that still promote their content? I don't care about them earning adrevenue but to try and kill their system. They wouldn't put out false content if they knew it'd hurt their viewership numbers. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:34:52
Well then fuck him. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:36:25
Their food sucks anyway lol They just want our attention
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:35:40
That's my point. They're placing these large orders to prevent a run up. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:04:13
I'll take a toyota and early retirement than lambos and bmws lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:23:58
Ebay support system sucks anyway lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:04:19
LOLL according to you and the bs articles pumped out recently at key points in time? It's called supply and demand. 
It'll rise back up as it always does, i'm not worried. Just takes a little longer.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:43:23
Can you go give the guy a wedgie?
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:41:31
Nice try lol
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:39:30
Yup, oh well. :( If we HODL long enough, a new one isn't too far! :D
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:05:13
They don't REALLY need to push anything though. They've got plenty of money so yeah it's a legitimate estimate. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:36:03
My point is they're aren't desperate so they'd avoid making unreasonable claims which could harm their image. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:26:01
2 years. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:38:27
They're probably paid as well to pump those coins and/or invested in those shitcoins themselves.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:39:17
It's dissing bitcoin indirectly by predicting another fall below 5700
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:12:14
That guy wins at life though LOL
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:48:38
The problem here is the fact that they're spreading FAKE news. Obviously paid off by banks.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:10:23
Not exactly. All the other coins fell too.
@_date: 2018-02-16 04:59:58
It's just corruption. Controlled by banks. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:38:43
Thanks, i'll check it out.

Put the joint down.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:51:40
It's not just the noobs it's also banks themselves buying and dumping huge amounts to cause sell offs. They release FUD then they dump massively in order to start a sell off.
