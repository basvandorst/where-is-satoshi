I tried this and got the same error. I'm running an older version 8.~ on bitcoin Qt, should I update first?

I made the mistake of copying all the files from my old mac to my new computer and this happens on my original mac when I try to access my BTC wallet. Really don't want to lose my BTCs :(

So I copy it to a thumbdrive then rename it to wallet.dat.new and just open that  on the new computer?

The error I screenshotted was from my old computer. I'm getting the same error on my new computer.
I did a complete copy of my old computer on to my new one when I bought it

hmm soo.. no one seems too sure about this?
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:46:41
Do I touch the peers.dat?
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:24:52
I appreciate this.
I located the wallet, do I move the wallet.dat to my new computer? I'm confused/dont want to lose my BTC

I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to anything on my actual computer.. Can you tell me how I can fix this given the information you provided? 
Thanks in advance

My new computer has these files already.. You're saying I should just overwrite them? That's scary :(
