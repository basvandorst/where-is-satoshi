Yang doesn't like free college. Look up his joe rogan podcast.


And now you just went full retard. He makes it clear that UBI is NOT welfare. Mainly because: 






UBI is a short term solution to the AI and automation problem (an equally and perhaps more crucial problem than climate change imo), a problem that NOBODY (in either politcal aisle) even seem to contemplate and take seriously (except for yang that is). If i was an american, i'd definitely vote for him.
P.S: a long term solution for AI and automation requires the breakdown of the producer-distributor-consumer economic model, which bitcoin might play a major role in.

Dunno about this sub, but May surely is desperate.
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:12:58

@_date: 2018-09-17 21:41:13

@_date: 2018-09-05 10:05:14
That's quite a dump. Good thing i reduced my exposure before that. Wait a bit till 7.5k
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:35:47
Imo the "uptrend" going towards 7.5k is low volume and doesn't look right.
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:43:59
Wtf is happening with bcd?
@_date: 2018-09-07 07:36:55
Op are you accumulating bitcoin? Brexit won't be kind to the gbp when you guys get out march next year.
@_date: 2018-08-04 10:25:47
Eh, most of the banks are starting to move their financial capital to eu cities. Now the uk government assures that there will be adequate food. The whole thing was a fucking shitshow.
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:23:47
@_date: 2018-08-04 06:56:43

Expect some freedom bombing soon.
@_date: 2018-05-05 22:26:51
The end of the weekend pump?
@_date: 2018-05-07 11:55:04

@_date: 2018-05-26 05:16:27
So that's why nobody is using NAB atms today, while everybody is flocking to commonwealth bank
@_date: 2018-05-07 12:01:07
Actually it will shot up from now (9.3k) to probably over  10k by the weekend. Accumulating now.

@_date: 2018-05-06 06:40:28
Oh look what we have here. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 11:57:41
Funny. I entered from 7k and just exited  I do admit most people can't read charts for shit.
@_date: 2019-03-12 06:40:09
Venezuela was a fucking shitshow even before the sanctions
@_date: 2018-06-04 08:02:06
And that's for the weekend dump guys
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:35:24
It's dropping like a rock....
@_date: 2018-06-16 08:54:05
At this point, 5k is the only way to go.
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:54:01
Either 7.2k or 4.8k for next support
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:32:37
Will we finally test 5.5k bois?
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:05:35
Wtf was that green dildo?
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:13:24
Because venezuela is what happens when democracy runs amok. Republics degenerate to democracies, and democracies degenerate into despotisms. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 03:58:53
Yeah right, my mistake
@_date: 2018-07-07 13:29:03


No. Inflation is, in theory, good for people with debts and bad for people with large amounts of assets.  It supposedly spurs economic activity by the fact that holding your money is a very poor investment choice.
In reality, inflation is factored into borrowing costs, and wage increases have been shown to badly lag inflation...so not as good as most would have you believe.
@_date: 2018-04-20 04:22:52
And we're back down again
@_date: 2018-04-20 04:28:10
Damn cucks!
