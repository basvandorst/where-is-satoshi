Maybe some external software could check that quickly.
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:40:10
That is indeed necessary for the latest transactions but not strictly necessary for transactions buried under (many) days of blocks and the UTXOs can be checked (for all or a subset of transactions) to fit the picture under "simplified payment verification" in the white paper (as far as I understand it).
EDIT: it could also be that you have generated the pruned blockchain yourself  and now just want to add an address (with or without  the corresponding private key) that has some bitcoins attached to it.

No? Can't you take the hash of a (UTXO) transaction and combine it with other hashes in the Merkle tree until you reach the Merkle root hash which is secured by the PoW. See the picture under "Simplified Payment Verification" in the bitcoin white paper. 
"He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it."

A few nodes can relay zero fee transactions and mining pools can mine zero (or very low) fee transactions if they are only interested in a short term gain, thereby killing the "normal" full nodes with an enormous blockchain containing basically useless transactions.

Thanks a lot. Could you answer my last question then:
At the moment I have a qt-wallet with about 20 watch only addresses (never spent) and a full node. So I could use that wallet and start bitcoin-qt in pruned mode and thereby downloading the whole blockchain again. If I, say 2 years from now, import the private key of one of the watch only addresses, bitcoin-qt will not rescan and I can happily use that address to make transactions?

Bitcoin is only money and the technology doesn't scale. The core developers know that all to well, if you haven't noticed that yet. This means high fees and only large value transactions. It's maybe hard to swallow but we'll have a hell of a job getting bitcoin to be money, which in itself would be an **enormous** achievement.
@_date: 2016-08-13 10:21:16


Checking the miners for example and enforcing the rules. Also without a blockchain your bitcoins are worthless and I don't want the blockchain stored in only about 20 places.


When it's technically possible. Any bitcoiner wants bigger blocks if possible, it would make us all rich. For now segwit plus 1MB -&gt; 2MB and see what happens is the best option. There's no reason to hurry, the competition has the same problems they usually compromise on more centralization.
In the mean time we should develop and transition to a pruned blockchain ecosystem. After that ... we will see.

The article is wrong, quantum entanglement doesn't allow communication (or influence) faster than the speed of light. It works as follows. 
When one measures the state of 2 entangled particles at station A and B, you know that the person at station B always obtains the opposite value of that at station A (independent of the distance between A and B). However, the person measuring at station A (or B) is not able to determine the outcome of his measurement. That value is given by a certain probability in quantum mechanics. Because the person at station A is not able to produce a specific outcome, he is not able to transmit any information. This is why quantum mechanics and relativity are compatible and why a measurement in quantum mechanics must be 100% given by chance otherwise relativity is broken and it is possible to transmit information faster than the speed of light.
EDIT: "It is hence impossible to wiretap, intercept or crack the information transmitted through it,” 
This is also wrong. This technique only allows you to KNOW there was someone in the middle listening because the entanglement (value at A always opposite the value at B) is broken. So when you observe: value at A not always opposite the value at B, you know someone has been listening.
@_date: 2016-08-01 13:51:25


Why would that be necessary if bitcoin-qt already knows the addresses (of the priivate keys you want to import later on) at the first blockchain download (plus puning). It can scan the addresses of which the private keys are known PLUS the addresses of which the private keys are not yet know (during the first download + pruning). Maybe it already works that way for watch only addresses right now?

Great to know it has at least some value and will improve in the future. It will get harder and harder for people to go through the whole validation process themselves especially after a block size increase.

You can put prune=550 in bitcoin.conf. The pruned blockchain will be about 2.5 GByte. **To try things out** you can download the pruned blockchain from a service I have set up recently: 
You can copy your wallet.dat to the .bitcoin directory and have a look. Because your wallet is up-to-date I think this should work just fine.
After that you **must** compile the whole pruned blockchain yourself so you don't have to trust me.

(still up) True but if enough people check random parts of that blockchain, it may be OK. The user can first check all root hashes of the Merkel tree, some random blocks and for each receiving transaction also.

Hey, thanks a lot. That worked to my surprise, I thought I had tried that too. Great! EDIT: it's also clear that it worked because now bicoin-qt also shows the "watch-only:" part.
So that means that basically what I wrote before no?
This means a pruned blockchain (of only a few GB) is independent of the wallet and can be downloaded by anyone from a trusted website, only checking the pruned blockchain randomly for a percentage of blocks. That is: checking the picture under "Simplified Payment Verification" in the Bitcoin white paper for some random blocks (and maybe checking it also for each receiving transaction).

As far as I understand it, the problem with bitcon-qt pruned wallets is that you have to download all blocks again if you want to import a private key. Would it be possible to include only the addresses of the private keys you might want to import in the future (but are in cold storage for example) and in this way you don't have to download the blocks again when you import a private key? Another way of asking this is: do you also have to redownload all blocks if you want to import the private key of a watch only address (in a pruned bitcoin-qt wallet)? How is this handled in (bitcoin-qt) HD pruned wallets?
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:31:51

There are only two intended stations A and B but someone in station C may be intercepting part of the signal or receiving the signal and then send the same information to station B. Without entanglement there is no way to know C has been listening.
The problem is if someone taps the information you don't know it. So it is a huge thing to KNOW somebody has been intercepting your signal. That's the value of the EPR entanglement used by the satellite.
@_date: 2016-08-19 08:31:43

That's not how bitcoin works. Bitcoin is worldwide and anyone who uses bitcoin will have to compete against the rest of the world. If there's inequality in the world, bitcoin can't fix it. That poor kid can never compete against a rich kid. My miner, for example, has no chance against a Chinese or even American cheap energy miner and of course bitcoin can't fix that also. 
As bitcoin doesn't scale (it's not just real time bandwidth but the time it takes to download the whole blockchain especially cpu) for now it will only be useful for higher and higher transactions. I believe we will eventually get there and be able to help that poor kid also but it will take a lot of time and effort but it  could also just as well be impossible.

You can check the chained prove of work. The hashes of the transactions have to fit into the blockchain. See the picture under "Simplified Payment Verification" in the bitcoin white paper. Also see what Satoshi has to say on this:
"He can't check the transaction for

and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it."
Otherwise, maybe we can create some tools to check a pruned blockchain quickly. Doesn't the 21computer come with a preloaded blockchain?

I always had a lot of respect for Roger Ver, but here he shows an embarrassing lack of understanding how Bitcoin works: 
1: If a "recommended" fee doesn't lead to a confirmation in a reasonable amount of time the recommendation is wrong of course.
2 You may still like bigger blocks but that should be because you think the transaction fee is too high not because a particular transaction doesn't confirm (which will always be true (a too low fee transaction won't confirm) for any block size (edit: even for an infinite block size because miners might not include the transaction or it won't relay).
@_date: 2016-04-23 15:42:51

SPV will reveal your bitcoin addresses and balances to the rest of world. Also you don't rely on third parties that (I think) will have a hell of a job to serve everybody when the block size goes up and more an more addresses have been created. With this method users only monitor their own addresses.
EDIT: I think (but I'm not sure) it's easier to cheat with SPV than with this method.
@_date: 2016-08-13 08:15:16
@_date: 2016-04-04 07:40:31
Only the first confirmation depends on the fee (usually). A lot of full nodes don't even propagate a transaction with such a low fee, although some still do. Of course it's all statistics, individual results don't really count but the difference is indeed rather large.
@_date: 2016-04-30 08:19:52
A litecoin confirmation is not equal to a bitcoin confirmation (also 3 litecoin confirmations are not equal in computer strength to 1 bitcoin confirmation) and would you consider doing 1000s of transactions for zero fee a good thing? Meaning you assume other people have nothing better to do in life than consume storage, energy and bandwidth so you can send zero fee transactions.

They should first send a little bit of bitcoin to the address and  see if the bitcoins get sent to a different address (private key still available). Then they can send the rest.

Sorry, deleted. Thanks for the reply! If I import a private key it's usually because it has bitcoins stored on it and I want to use them from that moment onwards (they typically come out of cold storage and have been watch only addresses up to that point).

Bitcoin never forked! Creating a pre-mined altcoin by copying the Bitcoin blockchain and adjusting the difficulty in the software isn't a fork of Bitcoin. Any joker can do that and it would be a meaningless definition. Only new rules that respect Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment every 2016 blocks and that create 2 independent blockchains could be called a fork of Bitcoin. Obviously that never happened (although it was tried a few times).﻿
@_date: 2016-04-30 05:51:33

Not really fast, it is usually equal to the "half hour fee" of 21.co. I never see an average of 241 bytes in my full node memorypool but usually something like 400 bytes or more on average.

Do  you have a mobile phone?
No, I don't have one.
Why not?
I don't think it's useful
**woman with bike and kid**
You are cycling and then you get a phone call!
**man (again)**
Do you think it's important to be reachable by phone everywhere?
Not even that, I'm not that important!
I have an normal phone, why do I need a mobile phone?
**man with car**
it can be useful but when my car breaks there's always a phone cell or a farmer with a phone nearby.
**woman with kid**
I have an answering machine so they can reach me at home but to get called when I'm on the road or in a train or to be able to call myself I don't find that necessary.
I wouldn't like it to be always reachable by phone.
I'm a student and I have an answering machine and that's fine.
**woman standing in shop**
We did it for years this way and I think that's just fine.
**woman sitting**
i have a buzzer for when there are problems, I don't need a beeping thing all the time.
**man on bike**
If people like to get in touch they can send a letter and when it's urgent they can call me at home
**last woman**
I know already I would leave (forget) it everywhere or it would fall out of my hands.

This is how Electrum works: 
Electrum basically checks if the transactions (they get from the Electrum servers) fit in the Merkle Branch all the way up to the root hash of a block (see the Bitcoin white paper). So Electrum only has to store the headers of blocks, not the UTXOs.

When restarting my full node, it checks 144 blocks (1 day):
That took about 45 minutes with the chainstate directory on an hard disk drive (I also use txindex=1 which is necessary to run an Electrum server). With the chainstate directory on an SSD it takes about 2 minutes.

You shouldn't believe in Bitcoin, you should understand Bitcoin and how it was implemented by Satoshi and why he later added the block size limit. Listening to an ex-convict who's only short term goal is to take revenge on his prosecutors (see his comment on Silk Road) is not a wise thing to do.

Bitcoin is but the people still need permission to pay for micro-payments in this set-up as they are using a companies' lightning node as a trusted third party (although only for a small amount of money).
@_date: 2018-09-16 08:09:24
No but you can decrease the unit (like lightning already uses millisatoshi for example) which has the same effect without changing the fraction of your wealth compared to other bitcoin owners. By the way, bitcoin is not the unit of Bitcoin, that's the satoshi. In the software, miners don't get 12.5 bitcoin but 1,250,000,000 satoshi. The "bitcoin" is just an arbitrary definition of 100 million satoshi.
@_date: 2018-09-21 07:13:07
Thanks, I'll put it as comment in my bitcoin.conf. It would be nice to know the answer for a pruning node (I do both) as well.
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:39:57
For example: 1 S9 Antminer gets you 0.00050153 BTC per day, while 5% of 12.5 x 6 x 24 = 90 bitcoin per day. So you would need: 179,450 Antminers for that. 
Or more direct: the total Bitcoin hash rate is 50,000,000 Th/s and a S9 Antminer gives you 14 Th/s. So for 5% of the total hash rate you need
50,000,000/14 x 5% = 178,571 Antminers  (about the same number).

Bitcoin defines the longest chain as the longest chain that obeys ALL the rules. In your case you haven't checks ALL the rules because you haven't checked the UTXO of your first block after which you start adding blocks and update the UTXO. The UTXO you start from could have more than 21 million bitcoins. However, I do agree that at some point we may have to accept that compromise.

What you are describing (so well) is really the worst possible situation: outsiders coming in, taking over without anyone knowing and planning a perfect attack. Even then it won't kill Bitcoin, people will lose some money but after that they will wait for a lot more confirmations.
@_date: 2015-12-31 11:33:56
It's important to realize that the first confirmation (edit: for the sender) is totally different from the second confirmation. The first confirmation may take a long time or may not even happen because you didn't pay enough fee. After the transaction got 1 confirmation the other confirmations will ALWAYS happen, on average every 10 minutes. So the first confirmation can be nerve wrecking but after that you can relax.

A question slightly related to this. Suppose the last 1000 blocks were added but you now learned they are in fact invalid (or, in other cases, corrupt).

Well, they can spend their own bitcoins, that would just create valid transactions but they can't spend the coins of other people. The only harm they can do is double spends with their own coins but that's not easy (unless they own almost 100% of the hash rate) especially if the community has been warned of what is going on.
@_date: 2015-12-31 15:57:15
Yes, it was from the point of view of someone sending bitcoin (added an edit). 
By the way: double spends are only possible if the receiver sends the product or service immediately. If he needs some time to prepare and send the product anyway, there is no need to let the sender wait for confirmations before accepting the payment. He can always decide not to send the product after being double spend. This fact is often forgotten.

You don't but don't forget you are asking a lot of nodes to store that unused money for more than 100 years for free. There is a limit to everything (and the private key could be really lost). So then: bad luck. You do need to do cold storage to cold storage after, say, 90 years.

Thanks a lot for explaining this so carefully! Indeed, if mining power suddenly goes up, a year of false data could be created in less than a year so this metric is not useful then and therefore this idea should be abandoned. I just couldn't understand what was wrong with it and why it's was never discussed but now I do, so thanks a lot.
By the way, I learned today that you created Eligius (correct?) and I'm (very modestly just for fun) mining with the Eligius pool. Eligius rocks! It is getting warmer now in the Netherlands so I'm going to shut down my S3 Antminer miner which I use to heat my home but will be back in September. I tune the frequency according to the amount of heat I need :-)

No problem. In the sequential case if you give 10 apples to your neighbour and your neighbour immediately gives (a copy of) his 10 apples to his neighbour, download and upload speeds are equal. So in a decentralized network it could be about the same. But sometimes someone needs to download the whole blockchain and then you need much higher bandwidths I would say.

If you run a full node, you can see what subversions of node software is connected to your node. A few weeks ago hundreds of bitcore:1.1.0 nodes came to life out of nowhere. Reading about them, they are supporting other versions of Bitcoin, for example, Altcoin Cash also known as Acash. They are also downloading a lot of data which your node has to upload. Basically they are an attack on Bitcoin.

If you divide bitcoin into smaller pieces, the proportion of your amount of bitcoins compared to others remains the same. The result is just a convenient smaller unit. You could start expressing bitcoins in blabla where a blabla=0.000000000000000000000000000000000001 bitcoin and nothing would change.
Bitcoin has value because computers over the whole world guarantee that there will never by more than 21 million bitcoins and that nobody can alter the transactions you make with bitcoins. Even the number of 21 million bitcoins has no real meaning:  it is just the result of how bitcoins are distributed over time to those people running the computers (starting with 50 bitcoin every 10 minutes, halving every 4 years = 50x6x24x365x4+25x6x24x265x4+etc -&gt; 21 000 000). 
The bitcoin system cannot represent other units of wealth or properties as well as the bitcoins it distributes because these units of wealth are not inherent to the blockchain and need trust outside of the blockchain as well, that's a common fallacy. Bitcoins can of course be exchanged for other units of wealth.

That way Bitcoin is harder to fork. If 25% of the miners fork Bitcoin (say with a higher block size limit) and still need 1008 blocks to mine (about 1 week for the original chain) it will take them about 4 weeks before a new difficulty is calculated for the forked chain. In the mean time, blocks will be generated only every 40 minutes on average while the original Bitcoin blockchain will still find blocks every 12.5 minutes on average.

@_date: 2015-06-20 21:46:00
True, in the sense that a full archive node that allows another full node to download the blockchain N times real time must have a bandwidth N times larger (I think that's what you mean). However, to provide a pruned node of data (with only a few days of full blocks) would require much less extra bandwidth.Right?

My children were complaining about too little bandwidth because of my (damn) full bitcoin node. So because I also use my full node as an Apache server, I made it possible for them to go to a website on my server and choose "bandwidth high" or "bandwidth low" (upload only). Of course they always forgot to put the bandwidth back to "high", so now the bandwidth will automatically go back to "high" after 3 hours :-)

Put the .bitcoin directory on an ssd and make a symbolic link to where you want to store the blocks. Like this:
    blocks -&gt; /media/fullnode/.bitcoin/blocks/
    chainstate/
    database/
blocks, chainstate and database are on a ssd. blocks is a symbolic pointing to a 1 TB external hard disk. Syncing will be MUCH faster that way.

**This is for when bitcoind has crashed**
For this example you have to install the csh (usually it's bash) for the script: warn.sh (see below)
Also install ssmtp, a mail will be sent to you every hour if bitcoind is down
Make sure the following is in /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
Put (change: some_email_address) what's below in a file, say warn.sh and after that on the command line make it executable: chmod +x warn.sh 
and then run the script in the background via the command: ./warn.sh &amp;
You can now logout, the script will continue.
while (1)
  \ps -auxww | grep bitcoind | grep -v grep &gt; /dev/null
  if ($status != 0) then
   echo "Bitcoind crashed" | /usr/sbin/ssmtp some_email_address

"Apparently a home internet connection can typically upload about 10 Mbps. Download speeds are higher, but let's take upload for a moment, since you'll want to be a good citizen and relay new blocks. At max capacity, your home internet would be able to relay a 46 megabyte block to 16 hungry peers every 10 minutes."

You need to go look at how gossip networks work; on average, you will download about the same amount of data that you upload.

Maybe 5 is a lot in the future maybe 2 of 3 is enough. For now that's necessary because the payment needs to route through connected and sufficiently funded channels otherwise Lightning doesn't work. For example, in my [case]( TRABZONSPOR cannot send me money directly because he has no satoshis on his side of the channel. If he is (only) connected to SkyeNet and has money on his side of that channel he can pay SkyeNet and SkyeNet can then pay me but not more than 3,504,012 milli-satoshis. If a payment is really big, you would still use an on-chain transaction of course.

I agree with your concerns but that's not the reason these people are posing and that was the point of my post.
However, you are right if it's your own money and I would personally never buy an ETN but this is often money that's been trusted to a third party anyway. You don't want someone to walk around with the private keys of $230 million of pension money. In that case, it's better if the bitcoins are stored by experts. It's also about more choice, which Bitcoin, as a permissionless system, must accept.

Glad I could help! The reason for the 3600 s (=1 hour) wait is that you'll only get an e-mail every hour while bitcoind is down. However, 12 hrs is too long, I don't understand that. To test the script keep bitcoind running, change in the script "grep bitcoind" into "grep lalala". The script won't find lalala and should immediately sent an e-mail to you. To stop the script already running, type on the command line: 
    ps -auxww | grep warn.sh
You will something like this: 
username 2778 0.0 0.0 5112 ... warn.sh
Now kill the script by typing (the first number)
    kill 2778
If there are more versions running kill them all. Then start the script again

Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of bitcoin, actually wondered about the same question. His solution, after some incredibly hard thinking and an incredible amount of hard work, was bitcoin the protocol, bitcoin the currency and last but not least bitcoin the software. This is one of the greatest achievements in human history. Therefore, I advice you to read everything possible about bitcoin and I'm sure you will come to the conclusion that it will be nearly impossible to improve that financial system.

Stop this nonsense. I can't wait too, it's great to decide for yourself when to spend your money. Spending is the only thing you can do with money, so don't worry it will get spent. So now leaving your bitcoins 78 years in a coffee can is indeed possible but still an unlikely thing to do.

Talking about messages in the blockchain has nothing to do with "blockchain technology". The word blockchain was used but not "blockchain technology". That crap was invented later by the banks.

Sidechains interact with bitcoins or represent an amount of bitcoins but you cannot say they are bitcoins. Sidechains, for example, can have a Turing complete script language, bitcoin by construction doesn't have that.

I used to use my Xapo debit card to buy regular things with bitcoin. I would send a little amount of bitcoin to my card and the bitcoin would be converted to euro at the time of purchase. It was as perfect as a credit card can be to buy “normal” stuff and a way to scale Bitcoin. I paid a whole vacation in Scotland only with bitcoin (including getting cash from an ATM) because it was so convenient. 
Xapo's card issuer had regulatory problems and the whole system was shut down. I don’t know of any updates and nobody in rbitcoin gives a fuck because they are only interested in price predictions and lambo’s but it was a huge blow for Bitcoin as an ecosystem.

Thanks. Sanblu convinced me he was right but I definitely prefer your conclusion! 
I would say a gossip network is just to keep up with the download speed (and everyone is downloading AND uploading) but a full archive node that allows another full node to (re)download the blockchain N times real time must have a bandwidth N times larger. However, to provide a pruned node of data (with only a few days of full blocks) would require much less extra bandwidth.Right?

I use it everyday at work to buy cappuccino and food (or parking fee). Load the chipknip with my pin upto say 25 euros with a machine at work (the machine now says it will stop working 2015)  Then I pay by saying only OK so I don't have to insert my pin each time. The great thing is that if my chipknip is empty, when I want to pay, I can still use the pin and after that recharge my chipknip. For once they introduced something perfect (with fiat).

This is all true. However, as far as I understand, after a really short amount of time (10-20 seconds even), a transaction is part of so many blocks being actively mined that it is almost impossible to take the transaction out of the system given how strong the bitcoin network has become. For $100 this is only a problem if the attacker could scam hundreds of merchants at the same time.
@_date: 2014-10-25 13:37:27
No you make a very fundamental error, you have to compare mining to just buying bitcoins. But yes, if you compare it to doing nothing at all you are absolutely right.

I gave a much better and very practival definition of property: property you would buy even if you would never be allowed to exchange it for anything else. That's why dollars and bitcoins are not property but money. Bitcoins are better money than dollars because dollars still have a value because of the paper they are made from. Pertaining to this definition of property I don't think there are any inconsistencies in my reasoning.

"All the gold I have is literal pure gold stored in a secure vault by a security company." That is what the Germans thought and now their gold is gone. Your gold: does it have your stamp and do you regularly check whether it is still there. If not then you don't own gold, period. With bitcoins in your private wallet YOU really own them.

Increasing the block size limit is a (trivial) capacity increase, not a scaling solution. A copy of the blockchain plus running a client with different rules on it (not adjusting difficulty every 2016 blocks) is a failed double spend, it has no consequences for Bitcoin at all.

You are neglecting the hardware costs (and risk) while those costs cannot be neglected. Also it is very risky/difficult/impossible to mine 20 btc compared to buying 20 btc especially over short time intervals.
EDIT: Watt/h is an acceleration of Joules :-) it's Watth. Watt already is J/s, Watth is J/s*3600s=3600J, so the unit of energy. I hate this kWh(=3600000J=3600kJ) thing, people should use kJ or J (=Nm=kgm/s^2 m=kgm^2 /s^2 ).

The unit bitcoin, and thus its price, has no special meaning. It's just a random definition of 1 bitcoin equals 100 million satoshi (the real unit used in the Bitcoin software). I, for example,  stopped using bitcoin as a unit and use Msat (MegaSatoshi about 73 dollar) which is easier if you work with the Lightning Network where everything is in satoshi.

"Both of these were verified by another people including competitors." Formaly that has to be checked for every single Trezor and especially the hardware part will be very hard to check. I still think the Trezor should be checkable externally by an independent program running on your computer. I trust Satoshilabs also but that's not the point and not in the spirit of Trezor's philosophy.

I wanted to write exactly the same thing but you wrote it better than I good have. This is absolutely essential. You can build things on top of the bitcoin protocol but it is not as “real” as bitcoin itself. So implementing things like ownership into a block chain can be useful but it doesn’t compare to bitcoin because bitcoin is not a promise but the entity. It's all there and you can't improve it.

First of all: I really appreciate your comments :-)
"This is just blatantly false." Of course you can hack your way around it, yes I can do it with Linux but we are talking where we would be in an Apple world. From your own link: "Apple, true to form, makes it simple to put media and files on your iDevice but the road really only goes one way. It can be pretty difficult to copy anything (or everything) back to your computer without a lot of trouble and sacrifice"
I remember that I tried to drag some of my music from the Ipod to my Mac. It just wouldn't do it. It wouldn't even say: Apple doesn't allow this, nothing. Do they think we are stupid, that we wouldn't find out. Wasted some time to figure this out also.
And of course in the same way jailbreaking doesn't speak for Apple it speaks for the unApples.
"iOS has never been open, Mac OSX is as open as any other desktop OS" True, Mac OSX is OK, iOS is not. I wouldn't be able to say one bad thing about our white MacBook, so I might still buy another Apple computer for my family members :-)

No, of course I assume you haven't specified another port number in bitcoin.conf (which, if present, is in .bitcoin). Also bitcoind should be running AND ready. If you type "bitcoind getinfo" on the command line you should see some internal data. 
Note: another way to know things are working well is if you see more than 8 connections.
So if you portforward to the correct ip-address where bitcoind is running and the port seems open and bitcoind is running correctly and ready then I'm out of options.
Good luck!

You're not really walking around with $1000, you got that amount on a relatively safe online-wallet so you don’t have to add bitcoins all the time. In the Netherlands I would also pay (in euro) with my ING card (and pin) but then the merchant wouldn’t know about the $1000 I have on my ING account.

This is especially true for online shops where they need some time to ship the item anyway (computer, Xbox). Why have a customer wait for confirmations? Your order should be confirmed immediately.

There is more to it than understanding how bitcoin-qt works. Theoretically immediately after you send some bitcoins your computer could break down. With my backup plan and using mulltibit that is not a problem. However, sending bitcoins with bitcoin-qt you would lose bitcoin. This is unacceptable.
Also after every send with bitcoin-qt  you have to back up your wallet as it’s almost impossible to know how many bitcoins you’re  going to lose if something goes wrong.
(basically the difference in the number of bitcoins shown by bitcoin-qt and multibit after the send). This seems even more unacceptable.

Thanks for the review and the photos! Have you checked the bitcoin to dollar conversion rate? I hear you talk about euro and dollar but not about bitcoin. The fact that the bitcoins are converted into fiat the moment you pay is vital.
XAPO: It may sound childish but I want the card to display "BITCOIN DEBIT CARD". If the card doesn't say "BITCOIN DEBIT CARD" I won't use it, make it at least an option! I want to say each time "I like to pay with bitcoins" and prove it. The fact that the bitcoins are converted into fiat is the merchant's problem.

I have signed a message on the Eligius mining pool to change some parameters. My user name on Eligius is my bitcoin address (no password). So the signing was necessary to prove I the owner of the address want to change some parameters. It worked, the message was approved by Eligius. This made me conclude that to verify a signed message only the address is needed, the public key is not needed for this. Is that true and how does it work? Again Eligius doesn't know my public key. Any information is welcome.

I doubt it, I think it's a myth. The margins in buying and selling bitcoins are really small (otherwise you buy or sell somewhere else) and they can also be unfortunate with price changes: if bitonic buys 400 btc at 1000 euro and the price falls to 500 euro they lose a lot of money (for now). Sometimes just hoarding is a better option. If they are rich it is probably because they got into bitcoins when they were really cheap.

There are currently indeed drawbacks to horizontal spending (like extra cost) and it basically only applies to people already possessing a significant amount of bitcoins. The basic difference is that the recipient is “forced” to use bitcoins, will probably also keep a fraction of the  bitcoins and not cash out everything. Of course, this should ultimately lead to a system in which local currencies become irrelevant and then “horizontal” spending of bitcoins will no longer apply. But it is also often really easier. if, for example, I want to play poker (actually my kids) on the Internet, it’s really easy to send some bitcoins to their bitcoin address, (especially in the way I described) and they can send bitcoins easily to my bitcoin address if I win and WE never need to exchange bank/credit card account details.

This worked flawlessly for me on Ubuntu 14.04 and I made a transaction on electrum and it communicated with my Trezor (inserting pin and conferming on the Trezor)
Download ZIP
On the Linux command line:
unzip electrum-master.zip
cd electrum-master
mv ~/.electrum/ ~/.electrum_backup
pyrcc4 icons.qrc -o gui/qt/icons_rc.py
Restore an existing wallet
Hardware wallet
Then choose:
Trezor wallet
EDIT: and if your trezor gets lost or stolen you can get your private keys from:

Basically there is your transaction and a scrambled version of your transaction and a public key. With the public key people can verify that the scrambled version of the transaction is the same as the transaction, proving that you own the private key (corresponding to the public key) with which you scrambled the transaction. They can also check that the public key corresponds to the bitcoin address.

A gold certificate just tells the IRS you possess gold and the gold is taxed not the certificate and the gold is the property.
See my perfect definition of property: "property you would buy even if you would never be allowed to exchange it for anything else" Bitcoin is money, it doesn’t tell the IRS you own any property. It’s because I have a sound common sense that I can really understand bitcoin and if you would really understand bitcoin you would never compare bitcoin to a gold certificate, it is far superior to it in terms of money.

So a bit is 0.00000100 BTC and a satoshi 0.01 bit.
Both a bit and a satoshi are not fundamentally the smallest units like the bit in computers. The Bitcoin software can be changed to accept much smaller units if needed.

"Please understand that Coinbase is a regulated Money Service Business under the FinCEN division of the U.S. Treasury Department and as such, we are required to review accounts in order to ensure compliance with regulations" That's a clever way to get a small government and have people pay less taxes, transfer the burden of regulation to the market.

Nobody beleaves this but you cannot jailbreak the Ipod Classic (160 GB)(or things must have changed since I tried a few years ago). The volume limit cannot be broken (and it is not just deleting a file or something that only works for the Iphone). If you have music on your Ipod and your Apple computer breaks, you can't drag your music from the Ipod to your new Apple computer. You can drag music from the computer to the Ipod but not from the Ipod to the computer. All these little things... and Linux is always the solution as is bitcoin.

LOL. Maybe it is confusing as you say. But what if we get rid of satoshi's and make uBTC the smallest unit. Then the unit bit of bitcoin would just be the smallest unit of bitcoin, like a bit is the smallest unit of a digital number. Everything would be expressed as integers. One bit would now be about 0.0005 dollar, pretty small. Please don't get angry, we are here to discuss issues. What are your feelings?

"Coins don't belong to people, but instead to anonymous addresses."
Totally confusing and even wrong: bitcoins do belong to people, namely those that possess the private key of the address.
"A combination of a precious commodity (like gold), a spendable currency (like dollars), and a speculative investment (like stocks), Bitcoins are the future of money." 
Bitcoins are a combination of a precious commodity (like gold: silver?), dollars and stocks?

Everything is so wrong, I don't know where to begin. Let me do just one point you make:
"Everyone here will trade in his/her bitcoins if offered $10,000 for 1 Bitcoin." 
What a nonsense, some will trade already at $1200, others at $100 000 and others (like me) are not interested in getting money for bitcoins but just purchase goods with it. The amount of dollars to bitcoin you possess just depends on your faith in dollars to bitcoins (and usability).

I think people should ask themselves this question: if by a stroke of genius someone would add something really new to the bitcoin protocol (which hasn't happened ) and create an even better cryptocurrency and you miss out on that one, would it bother you (because of the money)?

For creating a cold wallet where you only receive but never send bitcoins and where you destroy your usb after having generated your seed and written down many addresses (that you can use and check through blockchain.info) this is indeed safe.

First you can't say: 10 Watt is actually 10Watth, one is a unit of power (energy per second) while the other is a unit of energy (energy). 
The second sentence is true:
10 Watt = 10 Joule/s. So, leaving it on for 100 hours consumes an energy of 100x3600x10=3600000 J
1kWh=1kJ/sx3600 s=3600 kJ=3600000 J

Thanks you all! MultiBit-HD compiled this time without problems (and also multibit-hardware-develop) and all the tests went well. MultiBit recognized my Trezor, asked for the pin and asked to confirm on the Trezor after that. Then nothing showed up and also nothing if I choose "Verify Trezor". It's a start. I made a new wallet first in MultiBit and in the new wallet it asks if I want to use the Trezor. Maybe that's the reason. No time.

Cut the private key in two (overlapping) keys. Give one of the half keys to someone with a written and signed note that it should only be returned in 7 years.
For address: 1Nd5MikmANtTmzThqSn4qxuU7f2eZHiPhA
it would look like this:

It comes from the Italian word “tangibile” which means something you can touch (Che si può toccare, che si può percepire col tattoo). So what is taxed in the end is the, I agree, abstract value of “something you can touch” and the “something you can touch” is the real thing again. With bitcoin there is no real thing, that's why I consider it real money.

That wouldn't help, would it? You will still have more than 4mBTC in one address and they can trace that you put say 0.5 BTC from a larger amount. If you do that often, even with change addresses, it would be pretty obvious what your larger amount is. Right?

I'm going to pay my food at the Albert Heijn (Dutch supermarket) with a debit card even if it will cost me more. Bitcoin is in its infancy and "we" have to contribute to make it work through ideas, coding, startups, donations or paying a little extra. Consider it an ideology or a hobby if you like, which also costs money. This is phase 1. We pay with bitcoins, they will get lousy fiat. There will be many phases that should end with: we get paid in bitcoin, we pay with bitcoins, they keep their bitcoins, etc. And we will always hoard some bitcoins anyway that will make us so obviously rich that it's the least interesting thing about bitcoin.

"other companies might have that fee if someone steals your card" You can hardly blame Xapo for that. 
If someone steals your car, will the car seller have to give you a new car for free? Even if other companies have that service (to look customer friendly), other customers pay for it indirectly.

Dear Trezor team,
I own a Trezor and got it also working with electrum, have transferred all my bitcoins to the Trezor and know the 24 word seed by heart (and the pin). It's very convenient that you can use your computers without worrying to much about safety and only use your (well hidden) Trezor when needed. In one word the Trezor is excellent. Of course I trust you, however, I'm going to ASSUME you are just trying to steal my bitcoins. For that you only have to broadcast the seed in some secret way through a hidden software and hardware trick within the Trezor (don't tell me this is impossible). The question is: can we defend ourselves against this and the only real solution I could come up with is the following. We need a program running on the computer to which you connect your Trezor that intercepts all (Trezor) output from the usb port and when correct, transfers it to a browser or program like electrum. The Trezor should only output COMPLETELY known, standardized, traffic. The only unknown data should be the public key corresponding to the private key used to sign transactions. This public key can be checked by the program using the signed and unsigned transaction. In this manner we would have an independent program checking the Trezor. The Trezor team could best write the program themselves and publish it on github. Everyone could check the source code and then it would be impossible even for the Trezor team to steal our bitcoins! I know it's a headache but it would mean you (practically) solved the problem of creating a completely safe bitcoin transaction method without third party trust. Your thoughts?

In the future, with HD-wallets, you only write down the seed (say 12 words) and you're fine whatever happens. I'm already completely HD and it's so convenient.

Thanks I will. But the question is, is it 100% safe that is can we 100% interpret the traffic, I repeat 100% otherwise we can just as well trust the Trezor.

I agree that different coins have different ideologies to them but that is just not enough to justify their existence. The fact that satoshis are not spread evenly is a good thing this is true for any money or commodity, that makes you want to have them.

hash(seed + 1) = address1
hash(seed + 2) = address2
Since you cannot ifind the seed from an address (because of the hash) you cannot find address2 from address1.

Bitcoin uses cryptography for signing and not to make messages unreadable, so such a ban wouldn't apply to bitcoin.

then the money flows into bitcoin through miners buying equipment and energy which is about equal to the price of bitcoin. So it doesn't matter, I think.

Really impressive! I would say we are at the third guy now with bitcoin. 5000 bits.
@_date: 2014-12-01 08:20:19
Bitcoin is not trustless. Instead of a third party bitcoin assumes that the majority of many third parties in the system can be trusted (in terms of processing power) which also means the total amount of processing power must be high enough to withstand attacks from individuals or groups of individuals. This has profound implications, for example, it makes altcoins with less total hashing power inferior to bitcoin. 
EDIT: Trustless is not mentioned in the white paper.
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:34:51

I have not downvoted your opinion. I appreciate your opinion. I'm new to reddit so maybe I made some mistake.

Yes, that's an advantage but, whether you like it or not, in a democracy already money printing is (indirectly) 100% controlled by the people so that isn't a real difference.
@_date: 2014-08-07 16:46:56
Thanks for the reply! In general you are right but in the case of bitcoin because it is not fiat I find it relevant (and also to say it). The example of the card on the internet says "BITCOIN DEBIT CARD":
I just wanted to make clear that it is important for me and maybe also for other users.
Edit: if VISA/MC doesn't allow it then there is nothing Xapo can do and I will put it there myself as in the example card on the Internet in such a way that it can't be distinguished from a real print :-)

I've done that, but it's a pain. The truth is that dollars are psychologically meaningless to us Europeans. So the extra step of converting from dollars to euro's is annoying and you get into this buy sell misery. As an example when I tried it out: {"sell": "1.3533", "buy": "1.3644"} so there goes 0.8% out of the window. For that I much prefer BTC-e where I can trade only in euro's.
@_date: 2014-04-09 11:04:51

Hello mzt1
I really like your bitcoin client and intend to use it!
However, I have a problem and don’t know where to ask you elsewhere.
I installed the software under Ubuntu and that went fine.
The program (./bitc) starts up correctly and the block chain is loaded. I then figured out how to import a private key into wallet.cfg In menu item Wallet, I then see the correct address belonging to my private key (with the correct comment), so that seems to work fine. I know there is an amount of bitcoin belonging to that private key and checked it again with Multibit.
It also has many confirmations. But the balance keeps showing 0 BTC in green and I don’t see any transactions.
Could you please give me a hint what could be going on or tell me how to get in contact somewhere else.
Thanks in advance.

Thanks for the information. So in this way it seems possible to make a backup on paper of all private keys. But shouldn’t there be a dumpprivkey-like command within bitoin-qt for ALL private keys. This seems trivial to implement and you should want to avoid using any external software when dealing with private keys. Although I can understand there are privacy issues involved, the multibit method seems preferable to the bitcoin-qt method for all but the most advanced users.
@_date: 2014-10-25 13:43:52
Sounds really interesting, really appreciated. A final fundamental question then: could the Trezor just as well close the software and hardware to the public because everything can be checked externally?

Just transfered 0.1 btc (to my own but different address) with bitc, correct fee and both Multibit and bitcoin-qt said it worked fine!
Two minor things:
backspace in transaction at end of line should have no effect but continuous on the next line.
password should definitely be asked twice and checked for equivalence because if you make a small type error that would lead to problems.

It turns out there was a really good reason: How do I know you didn't copy your internet money and send it to someone else before you sent it to me? Meaning you used the same money twice. Well this 3,000 year old problem just got solved a few years back by some unknown genius and now we have real internet money. Soon the whole world will be using it, just like email and Google.

Great, with the correct Unix birth time it now works just fine! I thought that an early enough birth time would do the job. The nice thing about having a wallet in 'C' is that I can learn in detail how it all works and your code looks really nice. I also intend to use the wallet (carefully in the beginning). If I find any issues I will use Github.
Years ago I used "Cygwin" under Windows and had only good experiences with it. It basically gives you a full Unix environment integrated on top of windows (not next to it). People could download Cygwin and compile your program and if you also have a Windows computer you can check it out yourself.

I had that problem a few days ago. Basically you have to set on the router that you forward port 8333 to the internal ip-address (192.168. ...) of the computer running bitcoin-qt (for me it was under NAT =&gt; portforwarding). On Linux, after you start bitcoin-qt, the program is listening on port 8333 which means that after portforwarding, port 8333 should be automatically open (when a program is listening). Check using:

In my opinion the difference between a pruned blockchain (plus the last 1000 blocks with all the data) and an "archive" blockchain (containing all data) is not that big for a network based on PoW and as powerful as the bitcoin network. If that is true, then shouldn't we start moving to (semi) pruned blockchains because the burden of running an “archive node” (for free) will become too big in the future especially with larger blocks?

You can get a loan from a bank because in the end they can always print more money (these are not my words).

What does that mean?
@_date: 2014-12-30 10:33:41
It could be that I'm missing something about the Blockchain (and transactions being already included into blocks being actively mined). But this is the problem I guess we are talking about? 
I'm selling a Trezor. I generate an address and send it to someone. That person pays $100 in bitcoin. I see it appear in my wallet. I then almost immediately send the Trezor to that person. Then the only risk for me is to see the amount of bitcoin disappear from my wallet (taken out of the system), no?
@_date: 2014-10-24 22:26:40
The program described below is needed:
On an OFFLINE computer you generate many addresses with the same seed you use for the Trezor, you can print those addresses (edit: and public keys) even on paper. You transfer bitcoins to the Trezor but of course only to addresses corresponding to these offline addresses.
The user connects the Trezor to an ONLINE computer where ALL Trezor usb output is sent to a (simple) program running on that computer and the output is displayed. The user checks (possibly aided by the program) that the Trezor usb output  consist only of a bitcoin transaction (so it's impossible to output (part of) the seed) and the program waits for confirmation from the user to send the transaction to the Internet. If the paying addresses and change address correspond to the offline addresses and the receiving address is correct, the user gives the program permission to send the transaction to the Internet (myTREZOR.com). 
In this way you don't even have to trust the Trezor or any other hardware wallet!!!
EDIT: the public keys have also to be checked using the offline information.
EDIT 2: if the Trezor can be checked externally, the developers can even make the Trezor closed software and hardware which for their bussiness model is much more profitable because now they will be pushed out of the market later on with cheap copies of the Trezor. In this case ALL Trezor output should be known to the user by a protocol specification. Only the addresses and public keys should be non standard information but the user will check those. The Trezor guys can even write the program themselves and make it publicly available on GitHub.

**Thanks a lot for this excellent post.** 10% isn't huge but also not completely insignificant. If it becomes 30% or more it does become significant. Indicative or not, everybody is referring to the 21inc node count when discussing scaling while they should be referring to that count minus the number of pruning nodes. 
The reason is probably that in older versions pruning nodes weren't relaying and so didn't count. I will suggest to 21inc to correct for the number of pruning nodes.
However, great to know how to do the number of pruning nodes correction by hand.

If those miners think BU is the best way forward for Bitcoin, they should signal for BU. With BU more transactions would pay less fee. It's not clear this means more income for miners than less transactions paying more fee. Also don't forget, with BU, some miners can become a victim of other miners. They won't all benefit.

No, no, no, it has nothing to do with blocksize. The only transactions necessary are from 21inc to the webservices and even that could be done in dollars. The people in Africa get the website service not bitcoins, 21inc gets the bitcoins when a block is found. 
EDIT: or maybe I don't understand you.

Thanks for your long reply! There was a time when spam was really a big problem (also at my job). Then they changed the law in the Netherlands, where I live, and companies were forced to add the option to unsubscribe. Also e-mail servers tried hard to reduce spam for their custumers. Since then spam is much less of a problem (maybe for the famous people it still is a hard problem?). However, at the time I thought: spam can be a really hard problem that's impossible to solve unless you add a whitelist and why haven't e-mail clients the option to add a whitelist instead of all the other lousy anit-spam measures they include as options. Of course, the problem then is that nobody can ever enter that is not on the whitelist, not even some old friend that found your e-mail address on the internet or something.
Not long ago I read that the Prove-of-Work that bitcoin is based on was initially developed as an anti-spam measure. So I thought why not use bitcoin as an anti-spam measure because this is basically adding the necessity for the spammer to apply some prove of work. This, combined with my above whitelist solution and problem gave me my idea.
You have a good point I hadn't considered: locking yourself out of registering for any service, so you must be able to disable it easily if you expect such an e-mail.
Based on your comment I would say that we need an on-line service that contains and updates a list of all non-zero bitcoin addresses and returnes f(address, value)=1 if the amount of bitcoin for that address is &gt;= value otherwise 0. You could mail the sender that after an hour you will check the amount of bitcoin and will add the e-mail address automatically to the whitelist if the amount is correct. That way you wouldn't overburden the on-line service.
By the way thinking about it: another solution may be provided by 21inc. In the future you could demand some mining shares from the 21inc mining chip before you except an e-mail address that's not on your whitelist. This would also demand some prove of work from a spammer, so it would be very costly to send a lot of spam.
Anyway, it's a good example of a possible problem "e-mail spam" that bitcoin could easily stop without killing the patient!

It's not that simple. If it takes (in theory of course) only 1 miner (not even a pool) to attack the 1MB block chain, it's game over also for nodes and businesses. The total hash rate of a coin compared to the total hash rate of another coin (same hashing algorithm) does matter (otherwise mining wouldn't matter).

No, because by definition it would no longer be (my) bitcoin but an altcoin. So, or bitcoin fails (no more nodes or mining based on the 21 million including myself and gets attacked) or the maximum number of bitcoins is 21 million. Even 1 person can keep the system alive but it would be vulnerable, so then it would have basically failed. The scaling parameters are not fixed within the definition of bitcoin but the maximum amount is.

Written very quickly:
1) You are transfering the private keys necessary to move your bitcoins and that lead to the correct public keys that lead to the correct bitcoin addresses.
2) Blockchain.info is set-up in such a way that they are unable to steal your coins.
3) Like any password check, I don't know the details.
4) A bitcoin wallet shows the amount of bitcoin registered in the blockchain and helps you make a transaction IF you provide the private key or if bitcoins were sent to you to a private key (=address) generated by the wallet.
5) Transactions are broadcasted to special nodes in the network and there are only about 7000 of them. These nodes check all the transactions and if correct send the transactions to other nodes and store all the transactions on disk. They do this voluntarily and don't get rewarded for this service except that maybe they sustain their own bitcoin holdings.
6) This answer was wrong. Thanks greenthumble
7) Each miner (not node) can decide for itself how many transactions to include (up to a maximum). They can only mine empty blocks but will generally add those that pay most fees.
8) Don't understand.

It's just pool mining. To prove to the pool I'm mining FOR THEM, I send them shares (solutions with a lower difficulty). More miners are doing this and one will eventually find the real solution. After a while the pool (Eligius) will send me my bitcoins but they could just as well provide me with some Internet service (a movie) while I'm mining, so I'm basically micro paying with energy I guess Bitcoin is even bigger than Satoshi.

You are absolutely right. My post was meant for people who are "fun" mining like me. I mean mining like a hobby and to learn the game. It would be cheaper to buy bitcoins than to mine them but I'm doing that also. I want to mine 1 bitcoin and it will cost me a few hundred dollar extra but as mining bitcoins is already almost impossible for an inividual I just want to have been part of it. For those "fun" miners it is also instructive to mine on p2pool to see how that works.

Thanks, yes, then the picture I have is correct. In my opinion the difference between a pruned blockchain (plus the last 1000 blocks with all the data) and an archive blockchain is not that big for a network as powerful as the bitcoin network. If that is true then we should really start moving to (semi) pruned blockchains because the burden of running an “archive node” for free, as I do, is becoming too big in the future especially with bigger blocks.

Set a fixed internal ip address on you computer. It will be something like 192.168.2.10
Login to your router: you have to tell the router that port 8333 on 192.168.2.10 needs to be open. For me it was: advanced network NAT portforwarding.
Run bitcoin-qt but only when bitcoin-qt is running the port will be open (check here:

Buy a Trezor. Write down the 12 or 24 word seed (your cold wallet), hide the 12 or 24 words and put a pin on the Trezor. Transfer your bitcoins to the Trezor. You can use the Trezor on any computer with or without viruses or key loggers (bonus: you can use all your computers without worrying about safety or them getting stolen). Memorize the 12 or 24 words (make up a crazy story, it’s not so hard).

I had problems too (on Ubuntu 14.04 and bitcoin 0.9.1) with bitcoin-qt getting stuck because of opening and closing my computer and letting it go to sleep. Also bitcoin-qt was really slow. I switched to bitcoind and now everything is fine. I don’t really understand this because you would expect bitcoind and bitcon-qt to be practically the same but maybe because bitcoind is started as a daemon makes a difference (on the command line you start bitcoind as “bitcoind –daemon”).

Excellent question!
From this chart: 
we see that bitcoin traded on average about $500 for about a year (the other years are negligible due to the low price). 1.3 million bitcoins were created and if we assume also sold we see that: $650 million was invested. If not sold by miners it was invested in energy in that year so that doesn't make a lot of difference.
As an order of magnitude comparable but much less than the market cap.
So a bitcoin price of about $50 would still mean break even.

I shouldn't but ... It is a deep statement indeed. Newton's laws are equal to the "laws" we get when we take the statistical average of large quantum systems (this is called the "correspondence principle"). A lot of people try to interprete the axioms (laws) of quantum mechanics in terms of what they are "familiar with" but what they are "familiar with" is only the statistical average of those axioms. Axioms/laws can, of course, only be understood by deeper axioms but quantum mechanics more or less protects itself against acquiring deeper knowledge because of the uncertainty principle.

circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free."
You see, inflation free, not, transaction fee free.

I would have preferred 20 for this analysis but like you said I couldn't find that graph :-). Longer than 100 (a graph also available) would give 32% full (125,00/385,000). I have considered: (18+32)/2=25% full as a good measure but it looked too complicated for this post.
@_date: 2016-03-09 08:59:36
Great idea. Don't take the time integral (what interval?), just calculate total hash rate (gigahash/second) and multiply by the best mining chip energy consumption (joule/gigahash). This would give you the current minimum power consumption (Watt=joule/second) as the metric for the (time dependent) bitcoin value.
Edit: divide by the number of bitcoins. I get about 21 W/B (watt per bitcoin)
1,307,326,196 Gh/s
0.25 J/Gh
15,296,775 bitcoins
Edit 2: 
The total minimum power consumption is: 327 MW (1,307,326,196 x 0.25)
A human body uses about 100 W, so with 7 billion people that is: 700 GW.
So for Bitcoin security we use (the equivalent of) about: 327/700,000x100=0.05% of our food.

Absolutely, but it gets harder and harder to fully prune a node from the genesis block. It's certainly not the preferred setting but it would still be one of the most secure wallets. Also "normal' users (like me) can publish the hash of the block chain and new users can built on top of that (which is much easier).

That view is too limited: miners  can only sell their coins to exchanges or individuals because those buyers know there are many copies of the blockchain and that these bitcoins can be sold again to shops or individuals of which the smarter ones will run ... full nodes (and otherwise they are indirectly connected to a full node).

I don't get it, is it now possible to prune (edit: and use the wallet) and relay pruned and non-pruned blocks? Is that what is meant by Reduce upload traffic?
EDIT: 
Version 0.11.0 said:
For now, block pruning disables block relay. In the future, nodes with block pruning will at a minimum relay “new” blocks, meaning blocks that extend their active chain.
Block pruning is currently incompatible with running a wallet due to the fact that block data is used for rescanning the wallet and importing keys or addresses (which require a rescan.) However, running the wallet with block pruning will be supported in the near future, subject to those limitations.

This is just bitcoin moving to higher valued transactions with higher fees. Nothing to worry about, will happen for any max block size sooner or later and it's only at about $4 cents now. So it's fair to first have the fee grow by a factor of 10, after that, when the code has also improved, we can increase the block size.

Interesting, I didn't know it worked like that. Also thanks for the other explanations.
However, I was more thinking about how the debit card payments must work. I think (but I'm not sure) they send many deposited bitcoins to a special address. Then each day (or so) they have to estimate how many euros are needed for that day. Each day (or so) they convert a large chunk of bitcoins from the special address to euros to be able to pay the merchants in euro when a debit card payment is done.

Thanks for the answer, much appreciated. The user who only has btc will simply see: local fiat -&gt; btc and that will define his exchange rate. 
I would pay, for example, 16.34 euro and then observe how much of my btc were subtracted (say X). The 16.34/X would be my euro per bitcoin exchange rate, which I could compare to the Xapo exchange rate (or the Kraken exchange rate). I never have to see any dollars, just like with Xapo. If the exchange rates aren't too different, I would surely consider using the BTCC debit card also. Xapo's exchange rate is about 3% lower than Kraken's exchange rate.

Good question. It doesn't really matter. If you had X% of the total amount of bitcoins, you still have X% of the amount of coins after the split. If the total market cap (btc + btu) is the same after the hard fork (or the price of 1btc + 1btu is the same as 1btc before the hard fork), your absolute and relative total amount of wealth hasn't changed. So it's like expressing your money in btc or mbtc, it doesn't matter and it's not like printing more money which would go to a selected group of people.

I don't know if this helps you but:
I run bitcoind under Ubuntu as a full archiving and relaying node on a 24/7 computer/server. On the same machine I run bitcoin-qt in pruned mode (about 3 GB block chain, blocks only, no relay) connected only to my bitcoind daemon (only traffic: on average it receives a block every 10 minutes). When I remotely login to this computer/server via ssh, I stop bitcoin-qt and restart it (checking blocks at level 2 so it starts almost immediately) with the display variable set in such a way that I see the qt window on my local display (laptop). After I'm finished, I close the bitcoin-qt window and restart bitcoin-qt with the display variable set to the remote server again.

That's true but the median transaction size is 226 ( , so 300 bytes on average is not far from the truth. Main point is, if you take out all the shit transactions you get about 120,000 transactions per day instead of the 300,000 [claimed](

@_date: 2017-03-18 09:31:21
Basicly the LN is exchanging contracts (in the form of payments) about how many bitcoins each participant owns. As long as everybody agrees and is happy, there is no reason for a dispute and the participants continue to renew and exchange contracts. If some user tries to scam another user, all the contracts can be taken back on-chain and the Bitcoin block chain contains the perfect truth about who owns what according to the last contracts (the older contracts are obsolete)

This has no meaning because (edit: average) transaction size can change over time. Express transaction fee in dollar per byte or dollar per standard transaction (for example 226 bytes). It's now $0.32 for a 226 byte transaction.
@_date: 2016-03-29 07:49:38
That would be interesting but of course I just took the blockchain.info graph and made an estimate of the average "non-spam" transaction size, I don't have the original software. However, I think it's pretty obvious that only about 25% are "serious" transactions which gives us some indication of how problematic the full blocks really are.

Grow a dick (your own words from your comment history). lol
@_date: 2016-01-10 12:13:56
So what I get out of this:
1: bitcoin core doesn't validate signatures of transactions inside blocks up to maybe the last N blocks.
2: A "normal" fully validating and archiving SW node would still need the signatures for both the new blocks it receives and the transactions it relays (to other full nodes) and would therefore see (edit: at full capacity) a bandwidth increase of 3 to 4 times. (after N blocks the node can throw away the signatures (if 1 is correct) saving disk space).
Is this correct? Help is much appreciated.
@_date: 2016-03-28 13:05:02
Thanks for your reply, at least we see excluding a chain longer than 10 is not completely nonsensical.  It would be nice if blockchain.info would add more steps. Now they jump from 10 to 100.

I have been using watch-only addresses (in bitcoin-qt and bitcoind+bitcoin-cli) for about 2 years now, so it's possible if you use a fixed number of addresses.
In the console just use:
"importaddress" and use no rescan. After having imported all addresses, rescan to get the balances right. In the QT window the watch-only addresses will popup with their respective balances in a separate area. To see the balances after the rescan, you need to run a full node with the full block chain. If you run a pruned node you will have to reload the whole block chain again. This is not really necessary if you are not interested in historical transactions and only in the final balance because the UTXO set is enough. I made a github issue of that but it hasn't been implemented yet.

A malleability fix plus block size increase via SegWit and then wait and see for a few years how second layer solutions (plus (the SegWit) bigger blocks) turn out in practice,  is the only sensible direction for Bitcoin right now.
Bigger blocks don’t solve Bitcoin’s scalability issues in any way but completely ignores them and is just kicking the can down the road. 
On top of that, BU doesn’t even have **a** blockchain (because it depends on your individual settings) but several blockchains at the same time.

Bitcoin white paper: The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.

You need to download the entire (unpruned) blockchain before it can get pruned (**edit** but it gets pruned while downloading so you don't need more that 5 GB of disk space). That way you can check everything for yourself and don't have to trust anyone.

How easy it is to fuck up in a big way for exchanges, the core software and common people. Bitcoin at the moment needs 100% of our support. For this young, fragile and extremely difficult technology you're either 100% with us or against us.

They can only double spend (just stop doing business with China) or mine empty blocks (increased transaction times). That would be an act of war against the rest of the world  (and I personally wouldn't be very friendly to Chinese people visiting Amsterdam or the rest of the Netherlands). Won't happen.

So wallets and wallet usage (edit: or because you think fee level is too high) are the problem, not the block size. Do you want full archival nodes to drop out and reduce decentralization just because wallets can't do a proper fee calculation?

That's true but at least Bakkt can't claim to own more bitcoin than the number of bitcoins in all of their addresses (if they sign messages with the private keys belonging to the addresses to prove these addresses are really theirs). If some big holders can show with the certificates that they collectively hold more bitcoin than in all the addresses then Bakkt would be in big trouble. I agree that's still not perfect.
@_date: 2016-06-03 07:15:23
When you buy or sell, the price of bitcoin at that moment is irrelevant (because it's divisible). Also the past performance is irrelevant because you can't travel back in time. The only thing that counts is the difference in future expectations of both buyer and seller or just the need of the seller to buy stuff.
@_date: 2016-06-23 12:21:55
I am a bitcoiner, miner and full noder. I mean useless in the sense that if someone told you, you can buy bitcoins but never sell them, you wouldn't. This is not true for a house or a car, even if you can never sell them you would still want them. This is not true for bitcoin because they only serve for "delayed barter".

If 1 bit = 10^-6 bitcoin = 1 uBTC, you can't say 1 millibit equals a millibitcoin, because than you have to conclude 1 bit = 1 bitcoin. A millibitcoin = mBTC.
There is NO convention to my knowledge saying: 1 millibit (aka millibitcoin) because that would be silly.

The result would be your transaction won't be relayed to the miners and the miners wouldn't include the transaction. This would indeed make YOUR bitcoins worthless and therefore users choose a little fee because no one wants his bitcoins to become worthless let alone we ALL want our bitcoins to become worthless.

Flooding the mempool with transactions like in 2017 is a dos attack, not a regular fee problem. Actually, it showed the 1MB anti-dos/ddos measure introduced by Satoshi worked. Anyway, google Lightning Network and SegWit for some very effective measures to reduce/avoid high fees for users.

The bitcoin price is irrelevant. If you buy $50 worth of bitcoin, you get $50 worth of bitcoin. Asking for the price is already speculating. Basically you're saying: "the price is so high, it won't get higher in the future only lower" but that's not a valid conclusion.

@_date: 2016-06-25 04:45:05
Thanks for running a full node! This is really important for Bitcoin.
The most important next thing you could do is become also an Electrum server. 
Let me tell you what I find convenient:
First of all you could try to enter your computer via ssh. In this way you never have to touch your node computer again and you can get into your computer even when far away.
I make a backup of the entire blockchain once a month and store it in a safe place (at work). So if something ever goes wrong, I don't have to restart from scratch. To avoid having to copy the whole blockchain I use rsync:
rsync --delete -av .bitcoin/ /media/external/.bitcoin_backup
Because you have a computer running 24/7 it's nice to also make it an Internet server with Apache. You can easily dump some useful information via bitcoin-cli and have a look at it in a browser.
It's really really early, but you could also experiment with running a thunder node.

Is that true? When a block has been found on average it will take 10 minutes to find the next block but YOU jump in with your transaction somewhere in the middle of the two blocks being created, so on average you have to wait 5 minutes for the first new block (assuming a huge fee).

Every 2016 blocks the difficulty is recalculated. Normally that' takes about 2 weeks but if 80% suddenly stop mining it will take about 5 times longer than normal before we reach the 2016 blocks. After that the difficulty is recalculated and lowered. That's however worst case. If 80% stops mining when 1008 blocks have already been mined it will take less time before the 2016 blocks have been mined by the other miners.

Effectively you're saying that a currency that can be printed out of thin air and represents the worst of the worst altcoins could beat a currency like bitcoin: is not going to happen. 
If the price goes up all the time, people (miners) would just wait selling until the price goes down again. For that to happen the banks would have to sell some bitcoins or pay an infinite amount of fiat.

You simply can't compare a bitcoin transaction to a bank (or visa or paypal) transfer. A bank transfers a promise (based on nothing of real value) from one bank to another. Bitcoin transfers real digital cash (digital gold actually) which has value because the transfer can't be changed and the supply is limited.

I use a Xapo debit card and can send **a small part** of my bitcoins to the card and buy anything I want (exchange rate at time of purchase). So I pay with bitcoin and the fact that the merchant receives Euro's is irrelevant to me. Itś super easy except for one minor thing and you won't believe what that is .......... stay tuned.
In the Netherlands (one of the most developed countries in the world) it's not clear where you can pay (including a pin) with a Visa Credit Card. Now you would think you can look it up at a Visa website. No, doesn't exist. You can find it on the shop's website. Almost never. Ask in the shop. Well 50% of the time they say things like "I think so". And it's not easy. Just to give an example (there are many) of one of the most important supermarkets here (Albert Heijn (AH)). You cannot pay with a credit card except: the one behind the Palace on the Dam in Amsterdam and one other street in Amsterdam, the AH-to-go shops (train stations) and at Airports. In the small town where I live, I can pay in about half the shops with a credit card, including a big supermarket (but not the AH supermarket). So now I'm compiling a list of shops where it's possible to pay with a Visa Credit Card (bitcoin) myself. Great service Visa! Bottom line is: despite these minor problems, I can now buy whatever I like with bitcoin.

They don't, you have to download the whole blockchain again. It would be possible to only get the data from the UTXO set which would give you the correct balances of the addresses but not the information about the earlier transactions. I've propossed that [here]( but it hasn't been implemented yet.

You connect the Trezor (on the Internet) to MyTrezor.com. The Trezor will display 24 words that you need to write down and store in a few safe places. You can then send bitcoins to the addresses displayed on MyTrezor.com. I've connected my Trezor to my son's computer full of viruses and no problem of course. Whatever happens, if you have the 24 words (the seed) you can always get your money back.

makes bitcoin a savings pot and a transaction network for LARGER transactions. Also Xapo uses the exchange rate for bitcoin at the moment of your purchase (of stuff) and you can use VISA almost everywhere so very practical. Whether the merchant prefers fiat or bitcoin is not my concern.

@_date: 2017-01-16 17:33:16
Usually yes (called a change address) but if you want, some wallets give you the option to return the 0.9 btc to the original address. However, such an address has been spent, meaning its public key has been exposed. The original address is the hash of its public key and  immune to quantum computer attacks while the public key is not. So apart from privacy issues, it's also (a bit) less safe.

That's impressive. Believe it or not, for the time being and for small amounts, I prefer to pay via a debit card instead of directly via a wallet to reduce traffic on the Bitcoin network (less on-chain payments).

It doesn’t depend on the amount of dollars transferred but only on the transaction size in bytes.
transaction_size_in_bytes= x 148 +  x 34 + 10
fee_in_dollar = transaction_size_in_bytes x satoshi_per_byte x exchange_rate / 100,000,000
1 btc -&gt; 0.1 btc (to merchant) and 0.9 btc (back to you) -&gt; 1 input, 2 outputs -&gt; transaction_size_in_bytes = 1 x 148 + 2 x 34 + 10 = 226 bytes
[satoshi_per_byte]( = 80 (needs to be divided by 100 million to get bitcoin per byte)
exchange_rate = 825 dollar per bitcoin
fee_in_dollar = 226 x 80 x 825 / 100,000,000 = $0.15

I made that mistake in the past (and felt very foolish afterwards), it's 10 minutes on average. The fact that nothing was found after, say, 2 minutes the previous block was found gives you no information.

One reason is that when you have to import the seed into a Trezor, the Trezor asks (on the Trezor display) for the seed words in a random order. If you have a keylogger on you computer that person will know the words but not the order of the words. In that case 24 words seeds are much safer than 12 words seeds.

That's totally irrelevant because it's the miners that decide what transactions to include. So blockstream doesn't decide anything, why do you keep saying that, they just have an opinion about many of the transactions in the transaction backlog and as I've shown in my top comment I totally agree with them on that. You don't agree with their opinion and I totally respect that.

I make a backup of the Bitcoin blockchain on a separate 1 TB hard disk (that is hidden somewhere (no or empty wallet)) every month or so. The way I do that is:
Using command rsync while bitcoind is still running (this takes about 5 minutes), rsync again (takes about 30 seconds), stop bitcoind, rsync again (takes about 20 seconds), restart bitcoind.
Doing so, bitcoind needs to reconnect to all the peers. Questions:
1: is there currently a better way to do it?
2: it would be nice if bitcoind had a “backup mode” where all data is written to disk until the backup is finished and then continues without losing all connections.

It asks you to type in the seed words on a computer the Trezor is connected to in a random order. So, for example, for the first word to enter, it asks for seed word 11 on the Trezor display. The key logger wouldn't know the first word entered is actually the 11th seed word.

I would advise you to also buy a 1 or 2 TB usb hard drive (not expensive) to make a backup via the rsync command. I make a backup of the blockchain every 2 weeks and it only takes a few minutes (via rsync). If anything goes wrong you will be ready again within an hour and you don't have to burden the network downloading all the blocks again. It is maybe also a good idea to run in parallel a (non-relaying, blocks only) pruned node connected only to your own archiving and relaying full node because it just needs a few GB of disc space and hardly any bandwidth (that’s how I update [this]( automatically every 2 days)

First of all it was a copy, not a split (difficulty was lowered by a software change) but: ok:
No, it's not the same as inflation because no one owning bitcoin became richer in the sense that if you owned twice as much bitcoin than me, after the split you still owned twice as much bitcoin plus bitcoin case than me. You didn't get richer relative to me. With money printing the freshly printed money goes, for example, to me and not to you.

For a give block size this is true and how the protocol works so there is no discussion about it but if one has to decide on a new or automatic block size with all the data that has to be stored, it **unfortunately** has to be taken into account and anyone has a right to an opinion.

If those payments each have a different address (but if you're smart you would pay them to the same address) you would have many inputs and so a large fee indeed. That would be about 50 times the above example, so 50 x 0.15 = $7.5.
Another example could be if you have an adult website and want to generate a new address for each user and payment instead of the same address published on your website.

Cost per transaction (there are very large transactions) has no meaning, only satoshi per byte or cents per standard transaction. For a "standard" transaction with 2 inputs and 2 outputs (374 bytes) it is about 20 cents in 2017. Now (21inc): For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 20,340 satoshis (0.15$).

@_date: 2017-08-31 06:43:59


Does that include downloading the whole blockchain over a normal Internet connection? I have a 200Mbit/s download connection, so that should be more than enough from my side.
My 64 bit, 4MB ram ubuntu linux laptop is now running for days but I have txindex=1, so that may have something to do with it. After that I make regular backups, it's just that I had a [problem]( I also keep bitcoind running on the old blockchain, and use bitcoin-qt (-listen=0, -blocksonly=1) to build the new blockchain (on the same computer, bitcoind builds the chain on an external usb hard drive, bitcoin-qt builds the chain on the original computer hard disk). I gave bitcoin-qt 2400 MB (dbcache) and am running Bitcoin 0.14.1 (that I compiled myself).  Another thing I do is:
sudo renice -n -20 processID
sudo ionice -c 2 -n 0 -p processID
but bitcoin-qt still only uses like 7% cpu all the time which I don't understand.
Any advice to speed it up would be nice!

I think so too but then it should be written more explicitly in the documentation in my opinion because for a pruning node it's a very important difference: scanning the UTXO (probably a few seconds) versus downloading the whole blockchain.

Bitcoin has nothing to do with gold and is superior to gold as a currency for the Internet and gold is superior to bitcoin without the Internet. Gold is gold and bitcoin is bitcoin and they don't have a thing in common. You can't make earrings from bitcoins and you can't pay electronically with gold. Bitcoin is finite, gold is not. You can't make a safe physical currency with bitcoin and you always have a safe (but not electronic) physical currency with gold. Etcetera.

Of course you get 
hash(B)=hash(B^base + hash(A)), for chain A then B
and 
hash(A)=hash(A^base + hash(B)), for chain B then A
but both chains are equally valid and can be easily produced in parallel. The only thing that prevents this is the PoW which makes it computationally too hard to do.

If I understand it correctly, that would mean there are 2 types of archiving full nodes:
1: Archiving (non-pruning) full nodes that store all transactions including all witness data.
2 Archiving (non-pruning) full nodes that store all transactions and only 1 year (or so) of witness data.
For a new validating node (not bootstrapping) starting from the genesis block,  the second type of archiving node would be enough (because the older transactions are buried under many blocks and signatures don't need to be validated anymore). Except for historical reasons, the first type of archiving nodes would  no longer be needed. So, in the near future, Bitcoin Core should give the user the option to start a type 1 or type 2 archiving full node.

No, but 10 minutes on average if you pay the correct fee is.
When you compete with the rest of the world with little friction and a limited resource, it's a bit naive to think the thing will be cheap. As it is now, bitcoin is for the rich and technologically advanced. Maybe layers on top of Bitcoin can be made cheap, I don't know.

That "their money" must be something that keeps its value long before it is being sent and long after it has been sent and is not something that is only useful when it is being sent. So yes bitcoin is money but money that keeps its value like gold (so its like gold coins and not like government issued paper fiat).  So if it gets forked it is useless.

It's true because a bitcoin address in not the public key in the public/private key pair but (simply stated) the hash of the public key and hashes are quantum resistant. The public key only is and needs to be revealed when you send bitcoin from your (never used) address to another address.

I think your last drawing and remark contain the clue of how to use a single locked fund to fund multiple services! That's great. I have no time to comment (and think about it) more at the moment but will be back later.
EDIT: Thanks for the drawing. My confusion was to assume 1 independent channel for each service but it is now clear that there can be multiple services on 1 channel. So if these hubs know about each other because they track the state of the whole channel, they can track funds.

@_date: 2017-01-17 09:24:26
The mining difficulty is recalculated every (6 x 24 x 14) 2016 blocks which normally corresponds to about 2 weeks. If right after a difficulty adjustment the total mining power is halved, half the number of blocks  (1008) would be mined in those 2 weeks, so it would take 2 x 2 weeks = 1 month for the difficulty to adjust. Confirmation time would double (20 minutes on average).

The 10,000 should find means to use Bitcoin less (make more use of centralized alternatives) but in a more meaningful way per transaction or wait for improvements. If the first 5,000 are much richer than the other 5,000, they can use Bitcoin more often but that's a result of inequality of wealth that Bitcoin can't solve.

The maximum is 7 tx/s how can you get a spike? And you would only get a somewhat higher level of tx/s if they spam with transactions that have a lower number of bytes per transaction than on average.

It shouldn't be difficult to change the 95% into 75% and recompile the software. I always compile the software myself. You could also choose to not run 0.13.1.However, this value was chosen by experts to avoid activation/deactivation like  problems. 75% would already be dangerously low.

The situation with Einstein and Satoshi is exactly the same. Genius insights and an incredible amount of dedication and hard work. I'm not in the mood to elaborate but the fact that in applications of special relativity one hardly ever talks about Einstein but about Lorentz (Lorentz covariance, Lorentz invariance, inhomogeneous Lorentz group) shows that Einstein also build on top of the work of others. In general relativity all non-Euclidean geometry was already developed by Gauss and Riemann, yet Einstein combined it all with tensor calculus (for massless spin 2 fields) and connected space-time curvature and energy-momentum into the Einstein equations of gravity in a (there we go again) Lorentz covariant form. An enormous amount of Blood Sweat &amp; Tiers that took Einstein about **8 years** to complete. Stop saying things like "anyone could have done this". It was Satoshi the genius and no one else.
**Satoshi's lesson is that you need to be the next Einstein in order to change the world.**

It has nothing to do with Core but with the protocol. No one knows how to reward nodes. You could pay for bandwidth but then you still wouldn't know if they also store a complete copy of the block chain, which in my opinion is much more important than relay. It would be nice if each node could prove it has a unique copy of the block chain, people have been working on that (in the past). See:

A "normal" transaction with 2 inputs and 2 outputs is 374 bytes:
1,000,000/374x6x24=385026 transactions per day
The minimum number of bytes (1 input, 2 outputs) is 226. So that's:
1,000,000/226x6x24=637168 transactions per day
another way to get this estimate is by using the known maximum of about 7 tx/s:
7x3600x24=604800 transactions per day
Excluding long chains is only excluding the shitiest of the shitiest.

bitcoind uses sdb (irrelevant, uses the old blockchain)
bitcoin-qt uses sda: that's the one creating the new blockchain. 
Device:            tps    kB_read/s    kB_wrtn/s    kB_read    kB_wrtn
sda              94,40      8081,60        85,60      40408        428

So tps: 94,40
avg-cpu:  %user   %nice %system %iowait  %steal   %idle

As long as the software keeps on running without hiccups for a much larger block chain and we don't upgrade the block size after SegWit, I don't think total storage is really a problem for the next 10 years (if I'm not missing something, cpu or relay bandwidth problems).
It's possible to buy a 4TB external usb [hard disk]( plus a backup hard disk for about max $150 each, so that's $300. That's only a small part of the profit I already made holding bitcoin and I'm one of those poor fellows who started buying at the ATH (but continued buying). So even with a max block size of 4MB after SegWit, this is enough for 19 years: 4,000,000/(4x6x24x365). 
So as long as the software keeps on running as it has until now, storage cost is not a big problem for many people in the western world:

Bitcoin White Paper:
*The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to
assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.*
This needs to be violated first, which is very unlikely and probably not even relevant at the moment.

Blocks will have to get bigger in the future, there's no question about it. But first the core developers need to improve the software as to use the available block space.as efficient as possible. I think it will also be important to develop a method to bootstrap the block chain as safe as possible so (not all) new users running a pruning node need to check and rebuild the UTXO set from scratch or maybe they initially download it and then check it in the background (maybe only statistically).

Well this last sentence is actually not that important. My main point is that BU is out of the question so IF you want to compromise to the people that think the SegWit effective block size increase is not enough, it could only be done with a hard fork that increases the 1MB transaction data to 2MB transaction data (so twice the effective block size what we get after SegWit, so 4-8 MB) but never BU.

Your computer needs to be online 24/7, otherwise it makes no sense to run a full node (edit: unless you only run it for your own use and not to help the network). You need a 1TB hard disk and a 100 GB ssd otherwise it will take forever to sync. Download the Bitcoin binary from  Start bitcoind on the ssd for 15 minutes or so, it will create a .bitcoin directory (see .bitcoin/debug.log for info). 
Then stop bitcoind (bitcoin-cli stop). Now move the blocks directory in .bitcoin to the 1TB hard disk and make a symbolic link to that directory in .bitcoin on the ssd. Increase dbcache in bitcoin.conf depending on how much ram you have available. For more information see my [website]( If you only want to run a pruning node, everything can be done on the ssd. Don't forget to open port 8333 to get more than 8 connections.

It excludes transactions with the same money sent between addresses A1 -&gt; A2 -&gt; A3 ... -&gt; A10 all on the same day. This is unlikely for "normal" transactions and are probably strange transactions (like coin mixing or badly managed gambling sites). So for me it indicates there are more and more "normal" transactions and less and less shitty transactions because of increasing fees and more serious use cases.

Here it gets unclear. If we see cash as gold coins (more physical)  then you say:
1: The government auctions bonds to private investors
No gold coins involved here, just a piece of paper I guess.
2 Banks need to buy treasury bonds
What does "buy" here means? Giving IOUs (paper) I guess not gold coins?
3: to provide collateral to the central bank in exchange for cash 
So these paper "treasury bonds" bought with paper IOUs are collateral for gold coins?

Ok, you're right it's the number of tx/s in the mempool, I thought tx/s accepted. So if nothing is happening there, it probably means that the transactions have a lot of bytes per transaction. That's what I always see on my node. I calculate the number of bytes per transaction and when my relay fee is low there are a lot more bytes per transaction than when relay fee is high. I have now set the relay fee exceptionally high to 40 satoshi/byte and the number of bytes per transaction is a perfect 331. For lower relay values it's alway a lot higher.

Totally agree! It's indeed an amazing utility that makes Bitcoin far superior to gold.

Plus YOU pay with bitcoin (with a Xapo debit card at least) the fact that the merchant receives fiat is his problem. The LN will only make Bitcoin even more awesome.

That's debatable. New nodes (and crashed nodes) need other (archiving) nodes to sync so they are vital to the network. You can't even sync from a pruning full node. Helping the network is also helping yourself in my opinion (for example the extra continuous backups of the blockchain it provides).

The reason I and all the others choose to run a Bitcoin Core node has ZERO to do with Blockstream. That's what the miners and the exchanges realized. Their centralized hard forked shitcoin would be worthless. Anyways, you've just proven that Satoshi did the right thing to disappear and didn't feel the need to step in during the companies/miners hard fork attempt. An opinion by one now irrelevant guy wouldn't have changed that (unless he had great technical arguments).

Well you can't complain about Bitcoin then in its current form, we just had another ATH. We never needed "emergency difficulty adjustment" measures. That's why Bitcoin is Bitcoin and the others are (premined) altcoins. I have a lot of skin in the game. Life is good.

Whether you have port 8333 open or not, a pruning node relays transactions and (for the version you are running) new blocks to compatible peers.
However, it would be great if you open port 8333 so you also accept new connections (get more than 8 connections).

Because that 1 ASIC manufacturer could, for example, only sell his miners to miners who support really huge block sizes that would lead to a short period of big gains in bitcoin price, due to high tx/s, but would also lead to an unacceptable centralization because almost all full nodes would drop out. With BU it would not be possible to prevent that.

Bitcoin is a different animal than regular software development because it's scarce. In Bitcoin I only accept the world "fork" if the difficulty is not changed in the software, otherwise it's only a meaningless copy of the software and the blockchain that doesn't require any consensus. You and I can make hundreds of those copies and so the concept is meaningless. Bitcoin was designed in such a way to prevent "forks" through mining, consensus and the longest chain.
If there was a split in the community why did they have to change the difficulty "by hand"? A few guys disagreeing and wanting to be the new leader of Bitcoin is not a Bitcoin "split".

You may first try to reconnect. Port 9735 of ip 54.85.61.208 is open, which is a good sign. You should indeed wait until the node comes back online but if it takes too long then close the channel. A disconnected channel is indeed useless while it's disconnected. Temporarily disconnected channels happen all the time and are annoying but not a risk if you keep monitoring it every day.

No, SegWit really allows for [bigger blocks](

If I were Gavin and had said "until we find something better: 1MB per year max block size increase starting november 2015" , everyone would have been happy. But, hey, I'm not Gavin.
EDIT: 
20000 extra transactions per day every year for the last 3 years = 0.069 MByte per year block size increase (20000x500/3600/24*600/1000000). So 1MB is very reasonable.

I was already running a version of xt called: bitcoinxt-0.10.2A but I like the 0.11.0 more (also has pruning) and I also want to use the other versions of the core developers but only change to 8MB. So apparently this is the version with the 8MB and voting but why doesn't it just say that?

I know about the sybil problem but it's enough to know the number of full bitcoin nodes approximately. You have to know it approximately anyway to be able to value the network and to know how dangerous it is if your disk crashes. We need a best guess anyway!

Change /home/user EVERYWHERE into where you want to install Bitcoin Core.

mkdir -p build
../dist/configure --disable-shared --enable-cxx --with-pic --prefix=/home/user/db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix/build
make install
cd /home/user
wget 
tar -xvf bitcoin-0.11.0.tar.gz
cd /home/user/bitcoin-0.11.0/src/consensus
Use your favorite editor to change block size or execute the line below:
mv consensus.h consensus.h_back ; sed s/"MAX_BLOCK_SIZE = 1000000"/"MAX_BLOCK_SIZE = 8000000"/ consensus.h_back &gt; consensus.h

Bitcoin is the exact opposite of a religion.
Bitcoin never split or forked (not counting bugs), it's the only system that originates from Satoshi's Genisis block and has updated the difficulty every 2016 blocks ONLY. Copying the blockchain and applying difficulty adjustments in the software is the creation of an premined altcoin that doesn't need any level of consensus. Anyone can do that.
@_date: 2015-08-28 13:41:09
Could be true but where is it?: 
However, moving from 8 or 4 MB all the way down to 1MB can effectively be seen as an attack. I think if the minimum is chosen (in BIP100) the max block size should only ever increase but never decrease.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:18:04
Yes, but sometimes it is not clear if it is a natural back log or a spam attack. [This]( is also interesting. The number of "normal" transactions per day (addresses that haven't been used more than 10 times in a day) is only about a quarter of the number of "normal" transactions per day that fit in a 1MB block: 1,000,000/300 x 144

If they run different nodes in different counties to help the network, 4+ might make sense although they should be counted as 1 vote for consensus.

So if what you assume is correct (and it easily could be) then nothing would change by moving to XT (first case, essentially fee would not dependent on the number of nodes) and the QT guys would be happy too  (note: can't read the document now).

The fact that the bitcoin blockchain is not for buying coffee doesn't mean that the block size shouldn't be raised.

I would say it's at least a Bitcoin Core Wallet. If you don't prune the block chain and store all data on disk and relay historical blocks to other nodes, it's maybe better to call your node a super node than a full node. New nodes need super nodes to verify the block chain without relying on trust. I assumed OP is talking about a super node.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:47:26
Bitcoin scales so badly on-chain that 1x or 2x makes no fundamental difference except for people running super nodes (archiving and relaying full nodes) or electrum servers. 2x will lower the fees somewhat but it will quickly be filled by more spammy transactions. It's also unclear if the sum of 1x fees is less than the sum of 2x fees. On top of that 2x will be much more centalized, lowering the overall value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:21:55

Maybe, but there shouldn't exist even the possibility to go all the way back to 1MB once we have had 8 MB for years. So after some years you would know: that (for example) at least 2.5 MB max block size is guaranteed.

If I remember it well, I had that a long time ago. You should wait for better answers but if you don't get any, you could try to move the LOG file in the blocks directory to LOG_copy and/or the LOG file in the chain directory and see what happens. Maybe it was another one of the non-standard files in one of those directories. First wait for better answers, I'm not an expert. This is for if everything else fails. If you have enough space, first make a copy of the blockchain.

A corrupt database and I'm using c-lightning. C-lightning should only be used on testnet, especially that early. There's not much that can be done, others had similar problems. There's not a lot of money involved from my side of the channels as most of the bitcoins have already been saved (channels were closed). If they want to cheat me that's ok as long as the bitcoins don't get lost.
@_date: 2015-08-30 07:31:56
I think in your first example the new block size limit would be set to 1MB but like you I'm not sure which is ridiculous of course.However my argument is to at least consider the possibility to force a slow growth into the bitcoin protocol also because using the block size limit for scaling is not part of the original protocol (white paper) and should slowly disappear.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:40:09

@_date: 2017-11-08 12:48:35
It's a copy of the blockchain + EDAs (anyone could do that), so it's not a fork but a premined altcoin which made me (the enemy) a lot of money because it's premined. What's the problem? You can still discuss it in rcryptocurrency. We can't discuss every atcoin in rbitcoin. Bitcoin is complicated enough as it is.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:55:28
I don't use them and I don't trust them and I don't trust Xapo, they are businesses. I just appreciate Wences Casares gave up on 2x and people have the right to have a different opinion about the pace of scaling Bitcoin than me, as long as they are fair about it.This means: adding replay protection, trying to hurt the legacy system as little as possible, don't force miners to choose, don't fire up fake nodes, no EDAs and calling it btc2x or something. Oh and don't spam the legacy chain.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:56:53
Thanks, every node is important for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-10 22:20:01
But 8333 is the port number of a full node and has nothing to do with a lightning node. Two lightning nodes can connect to the same full node over port 8333. It's the lightning nodes that need different port numbers. For example in my case (c-lightning configuration file)
and the other lightning node
Nowhere do I have to specify the full node port number 8333.

@_date: 2017-11-03 15:31:15
That's why I want to see how it works out in practice. We need to have patience because on-chain scaling would lead to too much centralization (it's simple to calculate this) and it gets worse and worse over time. If the lightning network doesn't work well, we will have to use debit cards, putting only a small part of our bitcoins at risk. My Xapo Debit Card works perfectly. If you open 2 channels, they are disconnected if accepted by the Bitcoin blockchain so a double spend is impossible as far as I understand it.

I wouldn't like it also but formally it's not centralization because it's still a choice. Users/companies would still have the choice to check the whole block chain or start from a consensus UTXO set. There are many choices now also. A user can run a pruning full node or only download blocks without relaying blocks or transactions. Also, default, not all signatures are checked by Bitcoin Core.

Congratulations to you too. Is it 100% certain already? Thanks for the complement but to be honest I was panicking a lot because initially I thought all the power was with the miners who could kill the legacy chain by abandoning it (95% were signaling 2x). As you know, I was always against changing PoW or EDAs even to safe Bitcoin. But then I realized that if the result of their actions would be a Bitcoin that has lost its purpose, the miners would only hurt themselves and lose a lot of money. But that's part of the Bitcoin protocol: participants will act rationally (especially if a lot of money is involved). On top of that the miners would kill their own investments in ASICS and ...... we could always sell the 2x if it were so successful (high price) and wait for the 1x to come back. Probably didn't understand Bitcoin as well as I do now. It really is a consensus system. But, as you damn well know, let's make no mistakes: there will be other attacks on Bitcoin from every possible direction.

The advice is not obligatory and a “reasonable” fee and relay-fee advice is already part of bitcoin-qt (and wallets in general) and based on the approximate current bitcoin price. The beauty is that nothing is "fixed" (open source) but a general advice by experts is relevant and important.

EDIT: I wouldn't feel happy with only one other full node, so it's not that simple.
"which is basically the same as the XT proposal." I agree but I think it would be nice if the XT team would write down (edit: to convince the QT team) what they would (approximately) advice miners if the number of full nodes would decrease significantly. I only wanted to give an example of what that could look like.

Maybe there is a better variation possible to BIP100 than the minimum growth I suggested yesterday ( 
To get some guaranteed growth in BIP100 along with the flexibility in the  block size limit through miner votes, every 2 years we should evaluate the following:
if ((max_block_size(now) &gt; max_block_size(2 years ago)) AND
(max_block_size(2 years ago) &gt; min_max_block_size))
  min_max_block_size=max_block_size(2 years ago)
This way the bitcoin users can, in a completely dynamic way,  be sure about the minimum block size limit and that it will never be less than that.

Miners are never forced to do anything, they can create whatever block they like and announce it as a solution. In the current situation they don't have to check the transactions and so the signatures if they don't want to. Nodes check blocks and the consensus rules.

Some suggestions for BIP100:
Max block size changes according to BIP100 (most common floor (minimum) + plus 90% consensus) but can only increase
 
Max block size grows at least with 0.5MByte per year, so in 2016+n will be at least 1+nx0.5 MB (=min max)
 
Miners can decide to set the max block size higher than the minimum or in other words make the max block size grow faster than the minimum growth.
 
This has the advantage that an attack to keep the max block size at 1MB (possible for the original BIP100) will now only be able to keep the max block size at 1+nx0.5 MB (for example to a minimum 3.5MB in 2021) and also has the advantage that this minimum max block size is a guaranteed size which is vital for markets.
 
EDIT: the basic suggestion is to have a slow but guaranteed minimum growth added to BIP100, could also be something like 5% per year and the "but can only increase" could also be relaxed. This gives us sustained guaranteed slow growth plus the flexibility to react to fast advances in adoption or technology through miner votes.

Awesome! Have a question though . I have EPS working on my server (running Ubuntu) where it says "Listening for Electrum Wallet on ('0.0.0.0', 51112)" and when I run Electrum on the same server it connects and shows the correct (native SegWit Bech32) addresses and transactions.
However, when I try to connect from my (Ubuntu) laptop (instead from the server) I can't get Electrum to connect. For now I'm running with "ip_whitelist = *"
First question: I opened port  51112 on my router, so shouldn't I get "port open" on checking on the Internet when EPS is running?
Second question: should I run Electrum like this from the laptop:
Electrum --oneserver --server myIP:51112:s
Note that tor is also running on the server (and a public ElectrumX server (on a different port) I have no problem connecting to with Electrum).
Changed 5...2 to 51112 (the real port number)
For EPS (on the server):
`netstat -an | grep "LISTEN " | grep 51112`
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:51112           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
while for ElectrumX (on the server):
`netstat -an | grep "LISTEN " | grep 50512`
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:50512           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
tcp6       0      0 :::50512                :::*                    LISTEN     
it looks like the tcp6 is missing for EPS.

That's a valid concern but I think with the current block size for  the next 10 years we're fine (even though it will get tougher to sync). The UTXO set is hardly growing (less than 4 GB) which always leaves the possibility to restart  from a hash of a consensus UTXO set and with some diehards (like Blockstream, BitMex Research, Bitkoins.nl (haha), etc) checking the whole block chain and confirming the consensus UTXO set.

So after cracking the wallet encryption and obtaining the master PUBLIC key (basically the watch only addresses) all that remains is find the corresponding master PRIVATE key lol
Also, wallets didn't have a master public key in 2010 but that's a detail. On top of that, no one in his right mind would store just 100 bitcoin (10 cents or something) in 16 wallets in 2010.

Formally because using the block size limit is not part of the bitcoin protocol (=white paper) and should (slowly) disappear. What you are describing (reducing the stress on full nodes using the block size limit) is an altcoin.It only makes the argument of having a slow growth even more compelling.The block size limit was introduced against attacks to the network never as a scaling mechanism. Therefore bitcoin-XT is much more bitcoin than bitcoin-QT.

No it's not. You can send fiat to Kraken, buy bitcoin and send them to Xapo. Xapo's exchange rate is 2.5%-3% lower than Kraken. That's for fresh money. For (Trezor) stored bitcoins, you currently have had huge gains plus the advantage to spend them wherever you want. Plus Bitcoin is still young, fees will go down but so will profit.

SegWit is already (among other things) a 100% block size increase. Any reasonable person would first want to see what that does to the Bitcoin ecosystem before attempting another 100% block size increase. There is just no reasonable argument against the Core road map, not one.

I totally don't agree, uploading blocks is vital for Bitcoin and you also didn't really answer my question. The total chain is getting pretty big now and it would be great if full and pruned blocks could be uploaded by a pruning full node. It is still not clear to me if it is possible for new nodes to obtain a reliable pruned full node from other pruned nodes. Whether it is possible to stop the eternal growth of the block chain is at the moment for me the single most important question I have regarding Bitcoin and one that is not completely clear to me.

1 MB is already a burden but doable. SegWit would give us, without the need for a hard fork, an almost 100% block size increase and LN and sidechains. After that we reevaluate and increase block size if needed. The Core road map is a no-brainer.

You wish! 4MB block size even without SegWit, 2.5 minutes between blocks, no asicboost issue, scypt miners available, running without problems for a long time now, basically a copy of the Bitcoin software and SegWit soon: Litecoin is going to eat our lunch. With Litecoin the miners get exactly what they want. For the first time I'm affraid an altcoin is going to kill Bitcoin. I hope this comment will get into the Bitcoin obituaries and everybody will have a good laugh about it in the future.
EDIT: I proudly call myself a Bitcoin maximalist. I have always considered Litecoin a stupid useless copycat of Bitcoin. The centralization of Bitcoin mining manufacturing  (Bitmain) was already bad enough but now on top of that we have the activation of SegWit on basically a copy of the Bitcoin software. I'm also against altcoin discussions on r/bitcoin but here, I think, it's justified as a warning but I sure hope I'm just panicking for no reason. I've now said it once and won't start a discussion about Litecoin again because I'm not here to pump alts.
@_date: 2017-04-24 12:20:58


That's not how it works. The users need to beg the miners to signal for SegWit (this unusual situation is going on right now), the miners need to beg users/exchanges for a block size increase (they need to run the appropriate node software). Charlie can't promise a block size increase. The miners know this better than me but they do gain an immediate 4MB effective block size increase now and much more with SegWit activated. Edit: or maybe I'm missing something?

If a pool gets too big, say 25%, it's nice to know that as a user you are not helpless and can avoid that pool. Mining empty blocks will get less and less profitable over time and you can pay an extra large fee to the miners in your email list to give them an even bigger advantage.

SegWit is already (among other things) a 100% block size increase. Any reasonable person would first want to see what that does to the Bitcoin ecosystem before attempting another 100% block size increase. There is just no reasonable argument against the Core road map, not one.

It's completely safe without the possibility of a man in the middle attack so I think it's more peer-to-peer than the Internet. You may have to wait for your channel to close if the other party doesn't cooperate.

It's something like that but it's simpler because by just sending the transaction by e-mail (probably something dedicated)  the transaction doesn't have to be altered (no special coinbase address needs to be included). So instead of broadcasting  the transaction in Bitcoin Core to the Bitcoin network, you just send it via the e-mail (like) program to your list of mining pools.

Indeed that's what I mean. This guy is incredibly smart, look what he has build, it's an entire Bitcoin [empire]( So it might well be that he wants to build a sort of LN himself that is better or that he can deploy faster than everybody else. So he just wants to postpone SegWit until he's ready.

The transactions they sent you need to fit into the Merkle tree (Merkle root) of the headers you downloaded and so it's practically impossible to send you bad data. Censoring or interruption probably but I don't know about that.
The old versions of Electrum would ask you to update the software from the wrong website and you would then download a malicious walllet that can take your bitcoins but that has nothing to do with how Electrum works (except that they allowed the message). With the latest versions of Electrum that doesn't work anymore. Please let me know: were you able to select my Electrumx server "Bitkoins.nl" and did it work?

So maybe the miners really just want bigger blocks.

In .bitcoin:

Chainstate is about 3 GB and needs to be on the ssd, blocks points to an external (1TB, 500 GB) hdd via a symbolic link.
Also set dbcache as high as possible (something like half your computer memory)

Heat per serving = 25 x 226 x 4.2 = 23730 Joule
Total heat = 23730 x 1700000000 = 40341000000000 Joule/day
1 kWh = 3600000 joule
Total heat = 40341000000000 / 3600000 = 11205833 kWh/day
1 TWh = 1000000000 kWh
Total heat = 11205833/1000000000 = 0.01120 TWh/day
Taking the COP of 2 into account, energy required is half (thanks user Watada) that.
Total heat consumption = 0.00560 TWh/day
Money spent on mining bitcoin per day should be about:
6400 x 12.5 x 144 = 11520000 dollar/day
if on average 1 kWh costs $0.05
Energy per day for mining: 11520000 / 0.05 = 230400000 kWh/day = 0.23 TWh/day
So the conclusion is: 1/(0.23 / 0.00560) = 1/40th of the energy used for mining bitcoin

(tl;dr before this: bitcoin has real value) Without doubt there exists a relation between these two individuals that demands a payment in bitcoin and that has to be settled in bitcoin.

Yes, see the Bitcoin white paper:
8.Simplified Payment Verification
It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node.  A user only needs to keep
a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying
network   nodes   until   he's   convinced   he   has   the   longest   chain,   **and**   obtain   the   Merkle   branch linking   the   transaction   to   the   block   it's   timestamped   in.    He   can't   check   the   transaction   for
himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it,
and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.

Good question. With mining you point directly to a pool so there is no need to open a port. You may want to open port 8333 if you are running a full bitcoin node so peers can connect to your node.

Yeah, beginning of this year I was a tired from setting up an Electrum server and wasn't planning to start a lightning node but then I got just the right information to buy stickers from Blockstream and couldn't resist. Like you said, it isn't easy but once you've set it all up, with your own little command line tools, it's a lot of fun.  I'm a bit surprised so few people are actually interested to try it here.

The Lightning Network is a scaling improvement, not THE scaling solution. One possibility is that most people won't run their own lightning node but use a third party service to do the lightning transactions for them. Anyway, the idea that thousands of computers have to store every coffee purchase forever is too silly to even seriously consider.

If you have that much RAM **you should really** set dbcache much higher (in .bitcon/bitcoin.conf) like: dbcache = 3000 MB. That way you will sync  a hell of a lot faster (maybe it even helps with the problem but that's not likely).

That was March 2013. So, nice but nothing special. Bitcoin had been running for more that 4 years since he stopped mining and forgot about Bitcoin and left Satoshi on his own. The poor guy was very ill so I can understand that but there is nothing what makes him so special when it comes to Bitcoin.

Oops, it's down indeed. Never seen that before but there are many more available as you wrote. 
If you want to try things out with a fully synced node, you can download a pruned blockchain from a service I provide [here]( It has just uploaded the latest pruned blockchain and it should sync very quickly. Once your own full node is fully synced you can just delete everything.

For people without a Lightning Node, experience the future:
[Y'alls]( is truly amazing but it requires you to run a Bitcoin full node + Lightning node at the moment. Luckily you can now use this [service]( to check and pay the Y'alls invoice. Before and after the payment, you can check my channel balance [here]( Maximum amount: 500 satoshi per payment.

It's not perfect but we have to be realistic in that nobody knows how to scale Bitcoin in a completely decentralized way for the whole world population.

In my opinion even fiat can be seen as a second layer scaling solution for pure smaller local payments.

Ah, you have to click on the "(signature)" in your first link to get the signature and then have to put that into a signature file. That part is only explained under the Windows section of the manual but not under the Linux section. The part "Electrum-3.3.3.tar.gz (signature)" looked like one link and I only clicked on the left part which then only downloads the tar.gz file. The Linux section in the manual should explain how to get the signature file and not just say "Replace sigfile.asc ... as appropriate". And, also, I initially downloaded "Download and untar Electrum-3.3.3.tar.gz" where there is no signature while the verification works for that one also.

I even run a public Electrumx server, so I'm not that un-advanced (and doing my part).

You are absolutely right. For example, you can see my channel funding on  -&gt; channels. A few day ago someone wanted to buy from our (demonstration) shop (Products from Holland) but at that time my most liquid channel had 200 ksat (on his side) in it (now it's only 100 ksat) while the product was 250 ksat and so he could not buy the product.  In defense of lightning, these jewelries are a bit expensive for the lightning network at the moment. However, it's not possible for me to do anything about it, I can only **hope** someone will create a channel with me with a high amount of satoshi in it.
Solution: a serious merchant you should give people the option to pay via lightning or on-chain.


Well, by definition, they want to keep the money on their side of the channel for themselves, so no.


Yes, that's the only possibility I see in the future for bigger amounts and more serious merchants. Lightning will need big players together with smaller fish. I hope to become a medium to small lightning bank in the future, for example, for my own town.
@_date: 2019-01-24 08:25:19
With only $1 transaction fees (for opening a lightning channel or move a large amount of money) and (only) 10 transactions per second that's 
$1 x 10 x 3,600 x 24 x 365/1,000,000 = $315 million per year in **ASIC** processing power.

Mr. Nakamoto left so there is no "Nakamoto vision". However, we do know that Bitcoin should adjust difficulty ONLY every 2016 blocks, starting from the Genesis block  and is still the only coin to do so.

I got 12% more bitcoin because some fools used the wrong client and accepted the double spends. I get a feeling you're one of them lol

I bought a relatively cheap Antminer S9 that had a problem with the software. Down clocked the ventilators would still go full speed every 10 minutes or so making a terrible noise. I tried different Antminer S9 firmwares but the problem wouldn't go away. Finally I installed the dollemizer.com firmware from their website. I then chose the following parameters in their GUI:
    Search Frequency From: 200
    Search Voltage From: 800.00 mV 
After that it would down clock from 13.5 Th/s to 4.2 Th/s and the ventilators went pretty silent.
There still was an annoying rattle in one of the ventilaters but when I touched one of the wires to the ventilator it was gone (I have no idea why). So I fixated the wire with tape. Now the Antminer S9 is so silent that I keep it in the hall and at night or sometimes during the day we open the door to the living room to let the heat in but it always warms the rest of the house.
Note that although the hash rate is down what really matters is the J/Gh or W/(Gh/s) which will hardly change.
Good luck, hope this helps.

Very little at the moment but the Lightning Network should open bitcoin for retail payments in the near future. A great project was the Xapo Debit Card where you could pay via your credit card with conversion at moment of purchase that worked perfectly but was stopped because of some regulatory problems. So the main purpose at the moment is bitcoin as a long term untouchable store of value and larger (cross-border) payments.

With those 8 outbound connections you're also relaying blocks and transactions. See [this](

You need bitcoin to be a Lightning Network node. The more bitcoins you have, the better your LN node. However, the possibility to add a LN on top of Bitcoin was always part of Bitcoin, all SegWit did was correct a (malleability) bug. If you don't like the LN, don't use it.

It's apparently not easy not to betray Bitcoin in one way or another and start talking about altcoins, blockchain or cryptocurrency (the latest subtle attack on Bitcoin). It's hard to find such a person and when you do find one, it's almost always a Core developer or a user running a full node.

You should look in the debug file in the bitcoin directory (.bitcoin for Linux). You should find something like this:

If you message me your Tor address, I can try to create an outbound connection to your node.
I recently added 4 tor nodes to see if it would work, and it did.
For example:

    {
      "addednode": "hncffazpxbaf427j.onion",

There is no Bitcoin cash, only Altcoin cash. Altcoin cash copied the original Bitcoin blockchain and altered the consensus rules by not adjusting the difficulty every 2016 blocks but by adjusting it when convenient. Anyone do that.

@_date: 2018-02-08 23:04:10


The miners could do a thing like that, not the Electrum servers by themselves. These servers return the Merkle Tree of the transactions which must fit into the appropriate block of the longest proof-of-work chain. I know you know all these things better than me but the way you wrote it, it looks more dangerous to use an Electrum Wallet than it really is.
A personal Electrum Server only makes sense if you want to use a hard ware wallet, no?

You really need to use a ssd (syncing will only get worse)
In .bitcoin:
blocks -&gt; /media/fullnode/.bitcoin/blocks/
Chainstate is about 3 GB and needs to be on the ssd, blocks points to an external (1TB, 500 GB) hdd via a symbolic link.
Also set dbcache as high as possible (something like half your computer memory)
In the mean time you could download a pruned blockchain to play with, to make waiting for your own node to sync less hard. See

In that case you could add transactions at will but also remove old transactions at will. Mining makes it practically impossible to remove old transactions because it would destroy the chain of chained root hashes that was created by the combined computer power of all miners. On top of that mining is a way to distribute new bitcoins. So Bitcoin provides a practically immutable ledger where it is written in bitcoin how much each of the participants owns.

We need a system where the hardware wallet needs to sign the transaction and a simple program on your computer needs to sign the transaction. This way, if your hardware wallet gets hacked by one of its developers, there is still no problem. If you have a key logger on your computer, there is still no problem. The only possibility to lose your bitcoins would then be if the hardware wallet developer is also able to install a key logger on your computer, which is almost impossible.

Lol, a serious miner in the Netherlands with $0.23 euro per kWh? The year I mined my 1 bitcoin, I could buy bitcoin for about 220 dollar but I decided to mine one for about 600 dollar (miner + electricity). Funny thing is, even that bitcoin is worth much more now. I also bought (in 2015) at a record low of 148 euro per bitcoin. Currently I'm not mining but would like to. Don't be afraid, I will run a Bitcoin Core 0.15 full node soon. 
A PoW change would be the most stupid thing we could do by the way. That would give Bitmain even more power because they would be the first ones to build dedicated hardware and keep it for themselves or their close friends.

@_date: 2017-09-04 11:31:57
Hello ,
I had to rebuild the whole blockchain from scratch and because I use txindex=1, it took me a long time. The total size of the blockchain plus index information is about 157 GB. I will make a backup on another 1 TB external disk.
The good news is: I got the same sha-1 and MD5 as you
I can also tell you the total length of the bootstap.dat file: 
130669106745 bytes, so you can check that independently.
This is a great confirmation that we both have a sound blockchain. It's a shame no one else confirmed.
I plan to back up the blockchain up to a height that fits on a 128 GB USB.
@_date: 2017-09-06 10:12:58
That's correct in the sense that if I really had to choose, I would accept B2X (as a block size increase) before a code/protocol change. I hope in the coming months people will come to their senses and both can be avoided. Thanks for a great discussion!

Basically from this subreddit plus extra reading and just doing all kind of things as a hobby like running a full node, a bit of mining, using a hardware wallet, exchange, Xapo debit card, etc. I'm not a professional and haven't written any software. We are neighbours by the way :-), I'm from the Netherlands.
To be honest, I don't have much time but surely [here](  you can find almost everything you are looking for. I'm also not a big fan of the blockchain in itself but much more in relation to bitcoin. One eye opener could be to understand that bitcoin, the token, is inherent to the blockchain while external tokens are not. Still the blockchain can probably be useful for other things but I'm just not too knowledgeable about it. 
I would say, do your own research and if you can't find what you are looking for just ask it in this subreddit, there will always be some expert who will answer you. I will occasionally have a look at what you post.
Good luck with your bachelor thesis, you picked the right topic!

A decentralized Bitcoin is and probably always will be a settlement layer, that has nothing to do with Core but follows directly from a back-of-the-envelope calculation. To make Bitcoin a payment network, more centralized layers or services are necessary. Bitcoin is the best we have, it’s not perfect. Most Core developers have a lot of bitcoins so it would be in their best interest to make bitcoin better than it is today if that were trivial. To suggest that there is any advantage for them to harm Bitcoin’s development is insane.

Actually you have no positions, you only have an opinion based on nothing and a compromise based on nothing. Now especially if you have no actual data to justify your "position", it's common sense to increase the block size through a soft fork and wait and see what happens instead of a safe block size increase almost immediately followed by an unsafe hard fork. It makes no sense from an engineering point of view.

@_date: 2017-10-21 06:31:18
Wow, that's impressive. I had a [problem]( and had to download and sync the whole blockchain again and it took me about a week. That was on a laptop running Ubuntu and Core 0.14.2 with a 1 TB external usb hard drive and no SSD, so that is not unexpected. It is nice to know it can be much faster.  Maybe you also want to check the hashes of the bootstrap file.
Because my computer is not fast, I make regular backups on another 1 TB usb hard disk. There are 2 methods I can use on Linux:
1: rsync, rsync again, turn off bitcoind, rsync again and restart bitcoind
2: rsync, rsync and then use bitcoin-qt to repair for the lost data that was still in RAM. This way bitcoind keeps running.
The only question I have is if you could explain a bit more (a bit ELI5) how you use the Ryzen and the SSD. You have a desktop computer and these things are inside the computer or external devices? Would it work with Ubuntu Linux? What would it approximately cost all together? I would very much like to run an Electrum server (some day). I will try to Google all the things you wrote about the devices and try to learn.
Many thanks already!

@_date: 2017-09-06 07:07:27
There is no "we" in Bitcoin, only code. Bitcoin adjusts difficulty every 2016 blocks, hashes sha256 and started the chain in 2009. Unless there is a bug in the code, I won't accept a change just because we are all partying about price and conveniently forget about mining. If that fails, Bitcoin fails. If Bitcoins gets a severe blow then so be it, we will survive, but we can't change the algorithm/software. Nevertheless, I will keep thinking about what you wrote, so thanks.




@_date: 2018-03-04 16:09:08
Oops, you are totally correct. All my method does is separating inbound and outbound connections, not closed or open ports. I will have a look if I can change the script to really give me information about open or closed ports. Thanks a lot for this info. Very useful!
EDIT: changing the code was trivial, only perform the test on port 8333.
For example: nmap -Pn -p 8333 129.13.252.47 or more complete:
    st=$(nmap -Pn -p 8333 $next_ip | grep "open  bitcoin" | sed s/"8333\/tcp "// | sed s/"  bitcoin"//)
and $st will be equal to "open" if port 8333 is open.

It's not very sensible to ask what happens if Bitcoin drops to $0. If it drops to $0, it drops to $0. A sensible question would be why bitcoin's value would drop to 0. As long as you can't find a reason why it would drop to $0, your choice is justified at that moment, even if it does drop to 0 in the future. 
As far as I know, there are no reasons why it should drop to 0 but there are many reasons why it could suddenly drop a lot in value:  for example because of government intervention like we saw in China but maybe also because of a battle between the Core developers/users and the miners in November (segwit1x -&gt; segwit2x). Bitcoin is currently a high risk investment.

BCH is an altcoin (ACH, Altcoin Cash) because of the EDAs. The fact that they are abusing the term Bitcoin tells us enough about those criminals.

I hope you are right but I'm really afraid they (banks) are on the wrong track. What they should really talk about is micro payments (including third party trust) on top of the bitcoin network.

No, the relative wealth of you and me holding bitcoin hasn't changed after the fork (if we sell at the same time) so there is no money printing where some people get that free money and others don't:
X/Y -&gt; copy + EDA -&gt; (X+Xp)/(Y+Yp), Xp/X=Yp/Y=f -&gt; X(1+f)/Y(1+f)=X/Y
where X (Xp) is the price of my bitcoins (altcoins) in dollars and Y (Yp) is the price of your bitcoins (altcoins) in dollars.

Any version of bitcoin Core will reject 2x transactions. You probably mean disconnect btc1 nodes before the fork. For that you need bitcoin 0.15.0 or 0.15.0.1. I don't know what version update + upgrade gives you  but you can always go to bitcoin.org and download the latest version. Whatever version of Core you run (not too ancient), you made your vote!

Then were did the old spent transactions come from that you pruned? A pruned blockchain is nice for a wallet but not to support a trustless Bitcoin. For that you still need to archive and relay the whole Bitcoin blockchain. The lightning network only needs to keep the last transaction but not the layer 1 blockchain.
@_date: 2018-07-03 08:57:59


That sounds interesting because having to reindex bitcoind can be quite an obstacle for people to set-up an electrum server.

I did: no one is going to mine BitmainCoin and look at total hash rate and price of Bitcoin. Altcoin Cash had no measurable effect.
Over and out.
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:44:57
Even a miner that has 10% of the hash rate adds 9 out of 10 times blocks from other miners (and so is just like a non-mining node). After a miner creates a valid block, it will be added to the blockchain by nodes but after that the miner becomes irrelevant while the blockchain keeps its relevance forever. All people that want to power grab Bitcoin have one thing in common: they will tell you that only mining nodes (nodes of miners) matter, it is nonsense. Maybe [this]( also helps.

Last time I checked, the network was running just fine.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:56:27

If it succeeds you have your coins in B on one chain and in C on another chain.
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:27:47


That's not true because the 2MB isn't possible for technical reasons, not for political reasons. Max 8MB blocks is just too much for a decentralized coin.

Ok, I listened to it and it's mainly about altcoin cash. Who cares about altcoin cash? It's not a fork but a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain. Anyone could do this. The big question (that's avoided) is what happens if 98% of the mining power leaves the legacy chain? Well, Bitcoin stops functioning and everybody needs to follow that new chain or alter the rules of Bitcoin (through an EDA). We can handle it if 70% leaves (we just wait for the new difficulty adjustment) but not 98% or something like that. It is going to be very messy.

Most miners probably don't run full nodes, mining pools run full nodes. A pool bigger than a few per cent of total hash power should be treated as an attack on the decentralization of Bitcoin and a pool that only has 0.1% of the total hash power is 1 out of 1000 times essentially only a full node. So, reasons enough to run your own full node.

Yes, about storage space. If you don't want to introduce trust, every Bitcoin purchase has to be stored on all full nodes **forever**.

[Second]( FUD post by a 20 days old redditor.
@_date: 2015-09-07 11:17:28
Question: A transaction transmitted at a time 5:30:20 (signed by the user and assume for the moment this is part of a transaction) arrives at a miner 5 seconds later at 5:30:25. Another transaction arrives with a delay of 3 seconds. Now, of course, a malicious bitcoiner could put an invalid time in the transaction. To make such an attack expensive the miner calculates (5xfee1+3xfee2+..)/(fee1+fee2+..) as the total delay time and then divides by 2 (+...) to get the average delay time. Because on average a block is found every 10 minutes this could produce a dimensionless parameter by dividing the average delay time by 600 seconds. Would this be a good indicator for the health of the bitcoin network, for example, as an indicator of how many relaying full nodes are active on the network or how many may experience difficulties (bandwidth, ddos)? Could the block size (limit) be based on this in some way? Does something like this already exist? Miners could also calculate something like this based on the time it takes to receive a block found by another miner.

For Trezor:

sudo pip3 install btchip-python
sudo pip3 install hidapi
sudo pip3 install trezor
sudo vi /etc/udev/rules.d/51-trezor.rules put:

I agree that my statement was too strong (to call it an error). But it is not just a political argument. The percentile introduces an arbitrary parameter which the mean doesn't. The fact that it is almost impossible to choose a good value (10%, 20%, 30%, ...) is a big warning sign. That's why I called it an error but agreed that was wrong. However, I think it's hard to argue that with the BIP100 voting, the bitcoin white paper shouldn't be rewritten. So if the core developers decide to back BIP100, they should also have the courage to rewrite the bitcoin white paper and write that the original version has a flaw. What's your take on that? I really believe that without the 20% percentile value the bitcoin protocol is much less changed and rewriting the white paper is not necessary. You may consider this my last question to you so we can close the topic and of course I'm immensely grateful for all the software that's constantly being improved, let there be no mistake about that  :-)

I agree but bitcoin cannot serve the whole world (simply too many transactions). Some centralized system interacting with bitcoin for buying coffee will still be necessary.

As always you will be correct but I still don't see it. So despite the fact that if a 51%-er or a 49%-er finds a block the 49%-er will accept it but if a 49%-er finds a block the 51%-er will ignore it  (and will have to wait for a 51%-er block) the 51%-er will build a chain faster?

He then made sure it will become exactly 21 million (=50x210000x(1+1) (I think)). So it depends on the number of bitcoins you start with (50) and when you half the block reward (every 4 years).

trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.


In theory you can use payment processors (like Bitpay) for whatever reason "for most transactions" and still have the option to pay directly in bitcoin if necessary.

It's a double transaction, not yet a double spend. Only one transaction will be eventually executed inside the longest chain. Someone has to send you something of value before his wallet warns him about a double transaction spending the same money. This person should send you something within a few seconds. Real double spends are possible but nearly impossible. I have never seen a real example with someone losing money.

I’m not an expert, so much appreciated! As is often said (also by you), miners can already do whatever they like. The voting is just a way to formalize that process and make it more open.

That has no meaning. It's just 1.2MB for me, for a relay fee of 30 satoshi/byte. For lower relay fees, I see a ridiculous average number of bytes per transaction. Edit: a new block came in, it's now only 46 kB (and 330 bytes per transaction on average).
@_date: 2015-09-06 21:33:58
The "drawback" of BIP100 is also its "strength": 20% can block an increase from (for example) 1MB to 2MB but it also works the other way around, 20% can block a decrease from 2MB back to 1MB. Note that this 20% includes non-voting blocks. So BIP100 is very kind to the status quo (and possibly indifferent) minority. Basically it means: be careful to change the current block size limit because it will be very hard to reverse it.
Scenario examples:
20% 1MB
30% 2MB
50% 4MB
1MB (no change)
Conclusion: 20% keeps the block size limit to 1MB.
19% 1MB
31% 2MB
50% 4MB
1MB (current)
1.2MB (after 2 weeks)
1.44MB (after another 2 weeks)
1.728MB (after another 2 weeks)
2MB (new stable value)
Conclusion: 1% difference compared to 20% and the block size limit goes to 2MB.
20% 1MB
30% 2MB
50% 4MB
2MB (no change)
Conclusion: same preference as before (first example), but different block size limit because of history.
79% 1MB
21% 2MB
0% 4MB
2MB (no change)
Conclusion: first 20% 1MB preference was enough to keep the block size limit at 1MB, now that 79% has come to the conclusion they can only handle 1MB (based on actual experience) it will stay at 2MB because 21% wants to keep the block size at 2MB.

Interesting data. You are right, we mean pools when we talk about miners in our examples. An extra complication in these discussions is that pools are composed of miners who can change pools if they find it necessary.  Could you elaborate a bit on how important it is to run a full node for a pool?

I constantly monitor "bitcoin-cli estimatefee 2" and the average fee paid (that I can calculate using blockchain.info). The **average** fee paid is almost always exactly twice the bitcoin-cli (or 21.inc) fee. There are some people paying really high fees which shows in the average. The median fee is much lower. For a transaction with 2 inputs and 2 outputs (374 bytes) I now get 15 (bitcoin-cli 2 or 21.inc) and 28 (average) cents.

Until now I always thought it was possible to check the pruned data by reconstructing the picture under section 8 of the Bitcoin white paper. It's interesting to know how much bigger the pruned database would be if we stored the other hashes as well allowing the reconstructions of that picture (hash01, hash02). Just a thought.

@_date: 2016-10-15 11:59:25
Thanks but I don't understand. If the hash of the UTXO set at a certain height is periodically added by miners in blocks, you could download a pruned blockchain (basically the UTXO plus a few hundred blocks) check the hash and build (and relay) on top of that but always pruning (keeping a few days or a month of blocks). Existing addresses wouldn't know the history but they would know the balance from a scan of the utxo.So there is never a need to rebuild the utxo set from scratch if many blocks have been added by pruning full nodes on top thus making scaling easier.

That's a real danger indeed. However, if a miner mines a block that's bigger than any of the preference settings of any node (for example) that block won't propagate through the network at all. So, in general, big blocks will propagate slower than small blocks won't they because not many nodes will help them?

Well, the way you could use this is to quickly download the pruned blockchain and have a first look at the wallet etc. In the background you wait until your full node is ready. For me at least that would be what I want because I'm impatient (my bad). In the future I hope a system like this would be a **serious** alternative. Also don't underestimate the frustration one feels when your computer can't make it any more. I've been there trying to run an electrum server and it's not a great feeling if your computer can't make it (I sold 40% of my bitcoins after that). That's when I decided to build a least some form of an escape.

In the far future maybe but because of channel imbalances, the need for large funds in hot wallets and unreliable nodes closing too often, that won't be easy.

Yes (well done) but I think you're too optimistic. Bitcoin can't be used on a daily basis by  everyone in the World in the near future. In the most optimistic scenario it will be something like this:
1 Fiat and/or a Bitcoin debit card
2 Bitcoin on-chain (saving account)
3 Bitcoin Lightning (small, probably specific, transactions)

@_date: 2016-10-15 12:37:40
When you build the UTXO set, you are verifying the blocks. It's only that you bootstrap from a certain height, indeed believing all others (all (most) miners, companies and some people you trust publishing the same hash of the UTXO) have verified the blockchain before you (it's probably this that you don't like or accept). From that point onward you help verifying and relay blocks but you never have to start from scratch which would require a lot more bandwidth and cpu speed.

Prices of consumer goods increase also, but slower. As Bitcoin is electronic and  subject to worldwide competition, it fluctuates much faster. That's inherent to how Bitcoin works and there's nothing anyone can do about that. However, a good wallet should be able to make a good estimate. Also things like lightning network are probably more suitable for retail payments while bitcoin debit cards already are.

(very quickly pardon my Denglish) It would mean that you can fully verify all transactions and help send (pruned and non pruned) blocks and new transactions not yet in a block around the world but you would only store full blocks that are less than a year old and prune (reduce) older blocks. This way the maximum storage you need can be set to (say) 50 GB while you still use a Core wallet and contribute a full relaying node to the bitcoin network. At the moment you can prune a full node but without relay and without a wallet.

I also found the sibyl attack part the weakest point of the whole proposal. Thanks for explaining the problems it brings so clearly here. 
However, if a miner tries to send large blocks to other miners, the other miners wouldn't accept those blocks (not their preference setting) and continue to mine on top of the smaller blocks. This would be the case unless a big block is 4 blocks deep which can only happen if the majority of miners agree, no?

That is a very useful remark and finally explains to me what Satoshi wrote in the white paper:
"A user only needs to keep
a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain ..." 
"He can't check the transaction for
himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it,"
Which requires the user to store the Merkle branche of its own transactions while the receiver only has to store the chain of block headers (and his own transactions). Talking about scaling!
Question: is it (Merkle branches) still saved in the wallet.dat file?

Here I fully agree with you, that´s really not a nice characteristic of Bitcoin. The person you buy from can see part of your money. The Lightning network will solve this partially and only the nodes you open a channels with, can look into your bitcoin addresses. Still not great, that’s true. Maybe one day, when there’s more than enough space in blocks, we can implement something like what Monero has developed. For now it’s too early and scaling is (much) more important.

Formally it's a better computer. There isn't such a thing as a non-quantum computer.

Buy Monero at an exchange and they know who you are. Buy something in a shop and (if they want) they know who you are or where you live. You're never sure if you're buying coins or something illegal from an FBI guy/woman. So what I mean, privacy is overrated not because it's not important but because it's impossible anyway. Run a full node and some smart IT guy can track you down even over TOR (block arrival, activity correlation of your IP connection). Everyone who is running a lightning node right now exposes his IP address.

@_date: 2017-05-27 06:49:40
You should be OK. The 15 minutes is probably the time you get just for them to receive the transaction (without confirmations). They probably need 6 confirmations but it's not necessary to let you wait for that. They can simply ship after they've seen 6 confirmations. So: buyer has to wait 10 seconds after sending the transaction, seller sends good after (on average) an hour. They generated the address, they know now you have paid.

You want a shocking story about random numbers: 
A central station continuously shoots 3 particles to 3 observers so far apart from each other that we can exclude they can communicate during the experiment. The 3 observers can choose to measure property A with possible outcome 1 or -1 or property B with possible outcome 1 or -1.
After the experiment they compare the results and find
1 whenever, by chance, they all three chose to measure A the product of their findings is always -1
2 whenever, by chance, two of them chose B and one of them chose A the product of their findings is always +1.
Now multiply the last 3 equations and use B^2 = 1 to get
AxAxA=1 not -1.
Now for the shock: such an experiment is possible and has been performed!

Hi coinpanic-er! As you probably already know, I use your LN faucet a lot. It works great and looks beautiful. I changed my coinpanic.com, which was fake and a test, in fake.com and I see your real participation which is the only real one at the moment. That's really nice and the payout, if you win, should go smooth. Your invoice has indeed the correct expiry.
The UI part is indeed rather weak and not finished yet but t is obvious that you are a much better programmer and UI builder than I am. Now that the main parts are ready, I will concentrate on that but it's not easy for me.
Thanks for your community Jar on coinpanic.com, I use it a lot for testing.
**EDIT:**  I now see you have changed the expiry on all the invoices you create! People can now use your faucet to place a bet but I will first have to give people the possibility to choose an alias otherwise they will all be called coinpanic.com.

There are no benefits of Bitcoin, it’s unique and can’t be compared to anything that comes even close.
Bitcon allows you to send money, in your possession at home, from your home, digitally, to someone else.
You can carry it around, not in your pocket but in your head.
Just name another legacy financial system that can do that. There is none!
Or try to do that with cash. Send it with a rocket?
Don't compare a bitcoin transaction to a transfer of money that isn’t in your possession to begin with.

That's best explained with the original EPR experiment. There you find that if you measure spin up you know the other person in another galaxy will find spin down. So if it were possible for you to influence the result of a spin measurement in any way you could use it to communicate faster than the speed of light. Therefore it must be impossible in quantum mechanics to influence the outcome of a spin measurement (so it must be 100% random) and in that way quantum mechanics still respects relativity.

The first question you have to ask yourself is: if person A starts a coin and person B starts a coin, what makes coin A more evaluable than coin B, otherwise person C can also just start a new coin. In Bitcoin it's hash rate. burning real resources (the most fundamental universal physical quantity: entropy ("burning energy")) and added to that the value of the rest of the ecosystem. On top of that, Bitcoin enjoys the separation between miners and fully validating nodes checking the miners. I don't see what that would be for block lattice, it doesn't strike me as something revolutionary. However, if it's really a radically different and better approach we bitcoiners probably "won't get it" and go down with the ship :-)

I agree but if you assume the message is true that you are timestamping, simply assume the timestamp in the message is also true.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:28:49
Even if it takes 1 bit of the blockchain, it's too much because it's useless. They timestamp "something" **they** say it's "The Entire Internet" but it's just **their** version of The Entire Internet". The only thing you can timestamp that makes some sense is like a new mathematical proof, so you can proof you were the first (well the first to timestamp it actually, it could still have been stolen). Timestamping random text has no value. Only bitcoin has value because it's intrinsic to the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-05-14 17:13:26
I agree that that's the most important measure and not, for example, what the card costs. Xapo, about 3% lower compared to Kraken (euro). They need to make profit on low volume and we're pioneers. Here in the Netherlands, I see the same difference (4%-5%) in fiat prices in established supermarkets selling exactly the same product.

With the Xapo debit card YOU are paying with bitcoin, the merchant gets fiat and that's his problem. The only reason you are not really paying with bitcoin is because you don't own the private key to those bitcoins so that's not really bitcoin but for a small percentage of you money that's no big deal and you do help the system by taking a small risk in exchange for off-chain payments that takes some of the burden away from the bitcoin nodes having to store all transactions.
@_date: 2015-03-21 12:12:18

No, I like to know whether it can be made impossible to see spending the proceeds of theft in the Crypto world (as monero claims to be the case).

A Bitcoin payment should be instant if:
It takes the merchant anyway an hour or so to ship the product or he can wait for some confirmations but the one who pays doesn't have to wait that long.

That's not how it works:
At the moment my holdings in euro (displayed in the Xapo wallet) divided by my bitcoin holdings (also displayed in the Xapo wallet) gives a rate of 396.80 euro/btc. However, if I click on my debit card that is also displayed there, it tells me that the current rate used for buying stuff is: 392.83 euro/btc so it's 1% lower than what is displayed on the wallet front page.I also know that last lower rate is used when you buy stuff. They need to make some money and try to conceal it and that part I don't like too much. Xapo is about 3% lower than Kraken (euro).

Met mijn persoonlijk leven erg goed hoor (ik ben getrouwd en heb drie studerende jongens) maar ik ben de afgelopen maanden wel ongerust geweest over Bitcoin en was bang dat Litecoin ons zou inhalen. Het is een erg leuk hobby en elke dag is er wel wat te beleven maar 2017 was wel iets te veel van het goede :- ) Ik ben nog steeds ongerust over de centralisatie van mining hardware productie en vind Bitcoin op dit moment te gecentraliseerd. Ik hoop binnenkort een Lightning Hub te kunnen worden. 
 &gt; na het winnen van de Dutch Blockchain Hackathon!
Wat knap zeg, ik wist niet dat je zo'n goede programmeur was! En ook een startup met echt leuke collega’s.
Ik hoop dat je er ook wat geld aan hebt overgehouden zodat je wat extra bitcoins hebt kunnen kopen.
Als ik het goed heb zit je nu ergens in Limburg i.p.v. Leiden.
Om eerlijk te zijn is het mij niet duidelijk wat het voordeel kan zijn van een Blockchain.
Het enige dat ik mij kan voorstellen is iets van “escrow” waarbij A en B iets willen uitwisselen en C voor de transactie zorgt als er aan een conditie voldaan is maar zelf nooit het geld in bezit heeft. Maar misschien mis ik iets.
Wat wel belangrijk zou kunnen worden in de toekomst is het Lightning Netwerk implementeren bij bedrijven of zoets. Hou het in ieder geval in gedachten.
Leuk om wat van je te horen. Ik zie je in ieder geval bij de volgende halvering!

The amount of bitcoin you pay is determined by the bitcoin exchange rate so how do you mean "no bitcoin involved". The only reason you could say "no bitcoin involved" is that you don't own the private key to your bitcoins in the Xapo wallet and that means you formally don't own those bitcoins. However, if that's only a small percentage of the bitcoins you own that's an acceptable risk (which scales bitcoin).

They could be worth millions of dollars but they wouldn't be bitcoins because there is no trace of them in the Bitcoin ledger aka the Bitcoin block chain. 
What you are hinting at is what ethereum did. They created ethereum out of thin air and a lot of people were stupid enough to buy them. So they have value because people are stupid enough to buy them but they are not bitcoins.

Any sane person would activate SegWit (which includes among other things a block size increase via a soft fork) and wait and see what happens to Bitcoin. After an evaluation period we can decide on a block size increase. It's even possible we need more than a 1MB increase, it's also possible that any block size increase results in an insignificant scaling improvement. An unnecessary hard fork now is insane.

SegWit2x will activate SegWit. I watched closely how it all worked out for Litecoin and the miners did exactly what they promised to do.

This was posted by "targetpro" and as far as I can see, it is correct: 
What makes you think quantum computers will crack SHA256?
Bruce Schneier doesn't seem to think so. Applied Cryptography (pp. 157–8):
One of the consequences of the second law of thermodynamics is that a certain amount of energy is necessary to represent information. To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than kT, where T is the absolute temperature of the system and k is the Boltzman constant. (Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)
Given that k = 1.38×10-16 erg/°Kelvin, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2°Kelvin, an ideal computer running at 3.2°K would consume 4.4×10-16 ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.
Now, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21×1041 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7×1056 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured all its energy for 32 years, without any loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2192. Of course, it wouldn't have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.
But that's just one star, and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like 1051 ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.) If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.
These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.
 ...Even a mythical quantum computer won't be able to brute-force that large a keyspace.

Indeed, comparing units in an expression is often the best way to show something is  completely wrong. For example, the 1-dM can only be true if dM has no unit because you can't add/subtract a pure number (1) and a quantity (dM) that has some unit.

You may not like it but you can. I can blacklist any coin that was affected by the stolen coins. No? Suppose the coin had a (hypothetical) virus with it, you would reject any of the coins that came into contact with it.

Great comment. However, handing over private keys isn't tranferring coins to some trust but sharing coins with some trust because both parties would know the private keys. The only way to transfer (send) coins is via the blockchain. 
So saying you sent the bitcoins to a trust without a record on the blockchain is provably false.

If someone succeeds in finding private keys from public keys, your bitcoins are still safe if you never reuse a public key (use change addresses). In that (very unlikely) case, the only thing you have to do is stop making transactions and wait for a fix. Basically with an address you are revealing only a part of your public key, not the whole public key.

Would it be a good idea to multiply the output of RAND_bytes with a random array of bytes (not zero) simply generated by rand() and initialized with srand so not to be completely dependent on the SSL library? If for some reason the SSL library is compromised (on your or some computer) at least it will have the randomness of rand(). Of course random1 x random2 is more random than random1 or random2. Not sure therefore asking it here :-)

Indeed, bitcoin is a store of value but not an investment, it's a different form of money. 
1 bitcoin is only $0.65 if you start calling mbtc,  bitcoin. The market cap is more significant in that respect, it can't be changed by a redefinition of the unit.

The smart contract part was maybe interesting (although it was left out on purpose in bitcoin so it was nothing new), the actual implementation deserves the term premined shitcoin. If you have some decency and want to start a new coin,  you would announce that in 1 year time it will be introduced and anyone interested should get their mining gear ready, Also, as the captain, you don't sell 25% of your cons on the first spike.

Are you sure you want to run a full node right now? Or do you just need a wallet? For a full node, you need to put the bitcoin directory (.bitcoin for linux) on a ssd and the blocks directory on a hdd. Then make a symbolic link in the bitcoin directory (on the ssd) to the blocks directory (on the hdd). You also need to in crease the dbcache variable. Without these tricks, it's going to take forever, even if you have already downloaded the blockchain via the torrent.

There's your answer: 
@_date: 2019-05-12 05:21:29
The best thing to do is to look [here]( first and set the fee yourself if the wallet allows you to do that. If you're not in a hurry, the fee could be much lower. An average transaction size has no meaning because this is about your transaction size, which depends on the number of inputs. If you have no reason to think the number of inputs will be crazy, then a 300 bytes transaction size (relevant for the link) is a good rule of thumb but with more inputs it could easily be double that.

You have to download the full blockchain but your pruning full node will start pruning immediately. So you'll never need more disc space than about 5 GB. You can also download the blockchain directly from your own full node (running on win10) like this on your linux machine (assuming you run bitcond on the windows machine):
./bitcoin-qt -connect=192.168.178.20 -prune=550 -blocksonly=1 -listen=0 -datadir=/home/user/.bitcoin_pruned &amp;
(where 192.168.178.20 is the internal ip address pointing to your full node on the windows machine).
If you want to try things out first you can download a pruned blockchain from google drive via my [site](

That's why I wrote this some time ago: 
The idea is that you can split your funds into smaller funds each with their own 24 word derived mnemonic seed that can be inserted into a Trezor. You send bitcons to the first address of the seed (mnemonic). The master mnemonic will never go online and you can always get your funds back by regenerating the derived mnemonic seeds from the master mnemonic (offline).
I would like this to see this become an official BIP some day.

If a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain updates the difficulty faster then every 2016 blocks, it's not Bitcoin which, by definition, only updates the difficulty every 2016  blocks.

The price has been $250 for almost a year in 2015 so expressed in fiat mining was 2.5 times more profitable (yesterday) (edit: if you also bought the more efficient Antminer S5 or S7 and so the difficulty increase is negligible (thanks speakeron)). So now it's 1.25 times more profitable. 
Mining pools are too centralized but mining is not so if it drops, it will drop slowly. I still expect mining to go down in energy usage gradually but up in efficiently. 
As a home miner I have an Antminer S3 that  uses 0.75 J/GH but now there is a nice light miner (S7-LN) that's 3x more efficient (0.25 J/GH). However, there's also one (Antminer S9) that's 7.5 times more efficient. When a light miner gets on the market that also has the 7.5x more efficient chip (0.1 J/GH), I will buy one. That would mean a 7.5 times improvement in efficiency for the same energy usage.

Andreas is wrong here. As long as a cooperation between two parties is voluntary, it's not a master-slave relationship. There certainly is risk involved but that is true for any mutually beneficial relationship. I would say bitcoin (at this stage) is a marvelous invention because it make it much easier to trust banks with some of your money but not all your money. Edit: at the moment Xapo could only steal about 1 week of my regular income, that's an acceptable risk. After more time has past and Xapo doing fine, I could increase that risk to 1 month, for example.

Lol, you can say "smart contract"  as often as you like but the variables determining their execution depend on external input. "If team A wins from team B then" depends on real life events and thus on a third party who determines if A won or B (and they could be lying). The only advantage is that the third party doesn't hold the money (nice but not as revolutionary as digital gold and the third party could be (or collaborate with) A or B) and any sane person would build this on sound money like Bitcoin + SegWit.

Segwit already implements a real block size increase and it's already a pain for new nodes joining the network. I'll be more than happy if we can survive that **over time** when the blockchain grows. 
Making efficient use of every bit of the existing capacity is what we need. Scaling bitcoin requires the best experts in the world and that's exactly what's happening now with the Bitcoin Core client. Also, we don't know how to hard fork safely.

Depends, if your bitcoins have gained 50% in value it doesn't matter that much. These companies probably need to make a profit on a small volume and you do get a service in return, it's the cost of the service.
There are two supermarkets where I live where I do my daily/weekly shoppings (only 100 m apart) and the price difference between 100% equal products is often 4%. Just to put things in perspective.

The first sentence is already wrong and I stopped reading right there. 
The Bitcoin blockchain was copied but never forked. A real fork shouldn't change the (mining) difficulty in the software. Anyone can copy the blockchain, change the difficulty by hand (EDAs) and give the new currency a name like "Bitcoin Whatever". but that's not a fork. The Bitcoin client isn't even aware of that crap. All that happened when I sold my shitcoins for bitcoin is that people gave me  free bitcoin for a premined shitcoin. On top of that, there is no "split community" only scam artists. Do you see any shitcoin clients in the top 20 of [full nodes](

Mining centralisation is not great but it doesn't depend on GPUs or ASICs otherwise Vertcoin would be doing just fine. From the white paper: 
He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.

Suppose an item costs X euro and a merchant uses the Kraken exchange rate (Rk) for that item (B=X/Rk) -&gt; B bitcoin
1 sending the amount of bicoin over the blockchain costs the transaction fee. You pay: B + fee
2 paying with the Xapo debit card costs 3% more compared to Kraken: You pay: B*(1.03)
If the merchant, however, adds 1% compared to Kraken's exchange rate, it's different:
1 sending the amount of bicoin over the blockchain costs the transaction fee + difference with Kraken. You pay: B(1.01) + fee
2 paying with the Xapo debit card costs 3% more compared to Kraken: You pay: B*(1.03)

The supply of bitcoins would be effectively limitted also without the halving. The halving limits the supply faster.
Without the halving inflation in year Y would be 1/(Y-2009)x100%. So on january 2010 it would be 100% for that year, which is right. And 100 year from now (2009 actually) it would still be 1%.

Coinbase is no longer a bitcoin company, it's a cryptocurrency exchange. They will switch to whatever shitcoin is out there if they can make money out of ignorant people. And if the shitcoin fucks up in a big way, they will praise how well it performs compared to Bitcoin instead of admitting they were wrong from the start because they don't understand the fundamentals.
Bitpay, Circle, Xapo and Bitonic are bitcoin companies.

Of course, one can always recover (with or without a Trezor) from the seed. For example, I generated many addresses off-line because I use them as watch-only addresses in Bitcoin Core.

Hi autoblitz,
Welcome to the club!
1ml.com says you only have 1 channel and probably all satoshis are on your side of the channel so it's impossible to pay you. 
Furthermore, your port 9735 is closed so it's not possible to connect to you and create a channel. When I want to connect I get "Connection establishment: Connection refused". You need to open port 9735 and check with [this]( tool.
Note you can use coinpanic.com to test your node and invoices.

Yes, I'm seeing that weird behavior too. The only reason I (also) look at average fee paid, is that I have a simple (bash) script using blockchain.info data, so nothing as advanced (low level) as what you have.

What a great visualization, especially interesting to look at mining pool behavior. That helps a miner to choose the pool (behavior) he likes most. 
Remark: it would be nice to actually know the median transaction size for each block (I assume it was recalculated and different for each block)

That's true when you prune spent transactions but it is irrelevant when you prune the witness data after more than enough blocks have been build on top of it. Bitcoin Core already doesn't check all witness data (signatures).

1: you build smart contract on top of good money, you don't make good money if it includes smart contracts (the fork proved that). 2: smart contracts still need third party trust for their execution, so, very limited compared to solving the problems with fiat without third party turst (because bitcoin is intrinsic to the blockchain) 3: you don't try to solve every goddamn problem in the world in a decentralized way, the system will just collapse and/or become centralized. 4: eth doesn't solve a single problem in cryptocurrencies. 5: when looking for details the whole system is very vague and looks scammy (the creator sold 25% of his (pre-mined?) holdings on the first ATH)
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:21:57
I don't remember: are the seed words (initially) only displayed on the Trezor screen? If so then theoretically it's safer to generate a new seed because your 24  words could have been seen by a key logger (when you typed them in) although he doesn't know the order (and that should be enough). Never thought of that actually.

Xapo works here in the Netherlands. After getting verified, you can send (a small part of) your bitcoins to the debit card (then they're not your bitcoins anymore) and start spending them almost everywhere. The best part is that the bitcoins are converted to fiat at the moment of purchase. Now that I regularly use a debit card, I'm convinced gold doesn't stand a chance against bitcoin.


Absolutely because: larger amounts on-chain, small amount off-chain.

{money info, signatures of owners} -&gt; {money info}, {signatures of owners}
The "money info" alone is easier to understand and less malleable than the "money info + signatures of owners" part, solving a bug in Bitcoin that wasn't easy to solve. With the bug gone, applications on top of Bitcoin can finally be build.
After a year of adding blocks on blocks without problems, it's possible to throw away the {signatures of owners} part.

Ah, I get it. The problem I see is that in that case the spending wallet must know if the addresses that can be derived from the xpub (or something else) are already spent or not. So if these wallets are on different devices that's going to be difficult.

Better late than never :-) What you say is true and you can store the witness data also if you want. What you say applies especially to people promoting small blocks (like me). However, scaling will need compromises and removing the witness data (after a year or so) is one of the least damaging scaling measures one can think of, although it does indeed introduce some degree of trust.

Was on 2 week holiday to Scotland a few weeks ago. Paid everything and everywhere with my Xapo debit card. This includes the ferry (Netherlands-Scotland) and getting some cash (pounds).  It (including the Visa network) worked flawlessly and I enjoyed a nice discount because the bitcoin price was increasing during that time and Xapo uses the actual exchange rate.

No it's not that it's just an illustration that the extra costs are negligible compared to the gains this awesome technology brings us.  I use it to support the system, to learn, as a heater, as a hobby (which may cost a bit of money). 
By the way, one can learn more from mining than I expected. What happens in the mining scene is exactly what happens in other industries: Internationally it's impossible to compete (in the Netherlands) against other countries, the increase in scale, the specialized producers, the creations of large cooperations (pools), the race to the bottom, etc.
