@_date: 2017-11-02 19:47:09
I dont think so China is gonna start trading again.Japan is adopting BTC full force. BTC futures are gonna come into play and its gonna bring in so much cash flow.I just don't see it happening.
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:30:10

@_date: 2017-10-16 14:10:52
Im sick of all you non bitcoin investors talking shit. You are obviously intrested. If you can AFFORD to take a risk take it. Bailed out bankers got proved wrong didn't they?
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:54:54
I just got a trezor (grey) on amazon. Worked simple and smooth.

He’s definitely not Satoshi, Real Satoshi would never want himself identified ,if you look at history. I call BS.
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:00:25
Coinbase, that’s where I started. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:36:43

When bitcoin is doing good of course they will boast about it,plus it gives them views. Views = $$. But of course when it goes down god forbid they trash it like always. But yes I have definitely noticed it but read it and move on. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:09:39
Why do you think that
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:30:18
Definitely would use my own cash or equity in whatever you have.

It’s all really confusing to me atm as well. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:40:42
Well you heard the story of the guy who sold everything and moved his whole family in a tent. So I mean nothing’s stopping you so if you got the balls to do it then by all means go ahead. Scared money don’t make money.
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:29:06
No way
@_date: 2017-10-22 07:45:39

@_date: 2017-10-22 05:26:35
So you’re really comparing bitcoin to real estate�� none of that is even “innovative technology”. Stay on the sidelines bud
