I remember when I was a wee lad putting money into coinbase waaaay back in early 2017. Back then our emails were responded to within 24 hours. Now I never need to deposit money in crypto ever again :)

The "real" bitcoin is where people decide to put their money. This is a free market, stop treating these tokens as if there is some innate superiority.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:29:26
Nice meme... but if you honestly believe that bitcoin is better off without forks then you're completely missing the point.

this is why every government is a slippery slope to socialism. Because in every system there are more losers than winners.

They've made substantial progress in this area in the last 6 months.


Agreed, I really don't understand the anti-honey argument, and I'd even add non-factory chicken eggs to the list here.


I'm not certain that I can fault someone for choosing an issue to focus on. It sounds hypocritical on paper but I think it's demonstrable that eating vegetables causes overall less collective suffering on the planet.

invest the amount of money you can lose across 5 of the top coins if you want long term gains.
Invest the amount of money you can lose across 2 of the top coins and 3-5 volatile alt coins if you feel like gambling for large gains.
Do your research in either scenario.

No it doesn't. Both chains are equally "invented by Nakamoto" and, to be fair, core has adopted an intermediary called Segwit. So if anything the poster more accurately describes bch.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:30:48
If you are actually serious about Bitcoin core you shouldn't cower at the propaganda of the other side. You've legitimized their platform by tearing down their poster.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:39:36
Yes! Thank you. People are so used to the cradle that government gives you with regulated markets that is making countries go bankrupt. This is simply natural selection. It's how we figure out who deserves to survive.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:59:33
Here is an analogy to better focus on the issue being discussed: If you have a company, lets pick Samsung for example, and a second tech company comes along and calls themselves "Samsung, the Tech Company" would it be acceptable for a THIRD party to create an app called "Samsung" which sells the products of both companies but defaults to "Samsung, the Tech Company"?
In a regulated market this would be unacceptable, however the intention of Crypto Currency is to decentralize and deregulate as much as possible. This is why you need to be educated when  you get into crypto. It may take longer to get full adoption, but we're trying to build a more educated population, I think.
If I had to choose a side, I think it's acceptable for them to do as they wish with their app because if we start regulating here, then we just end up with a system that has a bunch of absurd barriers due to a few bad apples.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:38:44
You said it gives a **definition** of bitcoin. In this assertion you are incorrect if you actually read the poster. Both coins contain the letters "Bitcoin" - obviously confusion is part of the propaganda, but to ignore the facts that I've put in front of you is to be blind to the truth of the matter.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:04:01
Ehh, kinda. Initially people will think "awesome, this means bitcoin is king, i'll buy" but then you need to realize that a ton of people were buying BTC in anticipation because historically a fork have a combined value higher than the single chain. These people usually sell off right after the fork. So I'm predicting a fall in the near future.
@_date: 2019-12-25 05:47:17
Because we can check the math. It's not a closed source code.

The answer is diversification. That means stocks, bonds, and of course crypto.

No QR code? F.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:56:26


It's not. It's just as legitimate as any other crypto project, more-so than most. The problem is they have a different ideology in terms of how to scale the coin, one which they claim is more in-line with the original intent of the coin, and this split of ideologies fragments the community, thus hurting the pockets of those who wish for wealth to be concentrated in their favorite coin.
As to the actual technology, it's a reasonable idea that BCH has, though I'd argue that their scaling solution requires more on-going maintenance. The trade off is that you do not need to invoke off-chain solutions to accomplish it. It's really too early in this market to truly know which idea is better for the long term.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:27:13
This is what I call natural selection. A concept that is at the root of decentralization and deregulation. People who are too stupid to survive in this market do not earn the right to thrive in it.
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:55:58
I assume you're referring to segwit, which was locked in aug1, and not 2x which is slated for November.

The fact that he compares it to Enron....wutface.
Companies like Enron are exactly why Bitcoin is doing well. People that do not understand cryptography really should not act like they know how this whole thing works.

I'm not saying that banks won't innovate something, they very well might, but block chain is irrelevant technology to banks as we know them. The main innovation here is check verification redundancy that is provided by nodes. Banks have no reason, and no real method of implementing this sort of thing.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:30:11
You realize that in 1995 sending a picture across the internet was thought to be a difficult task to accomplish? Bitcoin is code, code can change, and Bitcoin is almost a house hold name at this point. So.. lets recap: Name brand? Check. Potential to scale? Check. I wouldn't bet against it.
@_date: 2018-07-30 15:03:04
\&gt; Bitcoin is a network and a blockchain, not just a client software implementation.
You might want to figure out who you are arguing with because it's not me. I just don't appreciate being called a shill because I recommend research and don't promote herd mentality.
Also, to your point, bitcoin is a network because it grew to be that way. A lot of coins need "training-wheels" to get where they're viable. Are you in favor of improving the technology?
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:34:27
This is such a dangerous  point of view and it is highly likely to get you burned again in the future. Forgive me if I have misread you, but based on your post it seems to me that you are making a highly emotional, and therefore irrational,  decision on this.
Let me state up front: Bitcoin is brilliant. That said, it is hardly the most innovative algorithm in an ocean of burgeoning technology. The people behind Bitcoin Cash genuinely believed that BCH is superior to Bitcoin Core, and in some ways it is. Do not stifle yourself. This market of crypto is highly volatile though highly promising.
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:43:36
I agree with this sentiment. I just wanted to promote rational thought instead of emotional tribalism. We have too much of the latter going around these days.
@_date: 2019-09-12 17:59:52
Wow. A very reasonable take from France. I think Portugal may have gone a bit too far with making crypto a tax haven, but what do I know ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

OP Says will never again fall for a counterfeit/scam referencing BCH --&gt; My Opinion: BCH is not a counterfeit nor a scam. BCH MAY be a shitcoin, BCH MAY have a poor model, these are not opinions that I am weighing in on. --&gt; I make the judgement that OP (and others) might apply emotions to future coins which may or may not be improvements and go with the "never again" mindset. --&gt; I make post cautioning this mindset.

the "Cherry Picking a definition" defense is silly.  Any definition that is "generally accepted" should quality as a valid definition. If the first definition returned by Google is not "generally accepted" then I don't know what would qualify as such.
Your definition uses the context of a "country" to define "general acceptance." I'd argue that the concept of a bounded country is draconian in the context of crypto\-currencies as these currencies are border\-less in nature. Therefore I'd extrapolate that because bitcoin has over 13 million users, a number greater than some countries, that one could make the argument that Bitcoin \*\*is\*\* generally accepted.

Frankly, none of the current chains are Bitcoin. Though for the purposes of simplicity and general marketing, I agree that the more popular chain should be allowed to carry the Bitcoin brand. These are the problems we are going to continue to face in the age of decentralized currencies, so educating yourself is the only defense.

You could say that the majority of stores in the world do not accept the Indian rupee, nor the Japanese Yen, Nor the Chinese Yuan, does that mean that these are not monies? Money is a medium of exchange that has an agreed upon value. Bitcoin is a money.

That's silly. Every currency changes in value. 1 BTC = 1 BTC. There are several services that I can purchase with bitcoin that accept the price of the service in BITCOIN, not in a converted USD to BTC value.
Edit: I do agree with the greater point that your post elucidates: That BTC is difficult to come to an agreed\-upon value because it is unstable. I think you should be more specific in your wording, however.
