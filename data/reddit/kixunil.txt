How is it better against sybil attacks? Attacker can make many TOR nodes too...
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:03:50
There are privacy tools like TOR, which can anonymise attacker. The problem is that if there is an attack vector, those tools (and honest people using them) have a problem.

Neat, can't wait to see it implemented! Now I see only 1024 bit RSA - it's a shame but better than nothing, I guess.
Thanks for info!
@_date: 2016-08-22 14:43:15
Thank you very much for detailed explanation! I'm excited to learn something knew again, so my need for knowledge is fulfilled. :)
Now I'm wondering why this technique isn't connected with https, so the user would get secure connection from the beginning, without relying on (insecure) redirect from HTTP... Maybe we could even ditch CAs...

@_date: 2016-08-08 10:07:06
I think some stupid government regulation forced them to make it less secure. So you should also be pissed of about gov.
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:52:11
If you have load of bitcoin, you probably don't tell anyone about it and you keep the keys at separate secret locations. Of course, you use multiple addresses. I can't imagine how the gov could find out about that.
If you store the keys (or at least password) in your head, then nobody can spend the coins without you providing those keys.
@_date: 2016-08-16 09:42:17
Sybil attack is creating many nodes acting like one giant network. The client must somehow receive the list of THS addresses. This list might come from an attacker. This is different from when you receive the address of THS from trusted source.
If you put the address there manually, that's a different thing...
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:24:42
Oh, thank you soooooo much for this response. This is awesome!

Seems like only ETC is decentralised. We can just wait for ETH to crash and burn...
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:23:48
Accessing localbitcoins using TOR might be enough. If someone shut it down, it could be just set up as hidden web service.
Other problem is that you might be exchanging fiat with gov agent. In this case you have a problem in either case. This can be elegantly solved using ATM. (There are some ATMs which do not require you to provide any personal information. For example, two of them are in Bratislava - Slovakia.)
@_date: 2016-08-22 07:49:56
Thank you for your answer! Didn't thought about it this way. Good luck with DNSSEC! One thing that bugs me with DNSSEC is that it operates like HTTP(S) - some are signed, some are not. How would the client know that the response should be signed? Is there a way to mitigate attack of someone discarding signed response and sending unsigned, spoofed one?

Can I somehow get the onion address of my node?
@_date: 2016-08-22 05:44:32
I fully agree. Service not being available is not huge problem. The bigger problem is that you have to trust the DNS to send you correct balance and also the network transferring it correctly. If someone MITMed you, he could send you false payment for your product/service.
Anyway, I think this is nice toy.

If you put a golden ingot on publicly visible space in your garden, it's immoral for anyone to take it from you but it's also your mistake putting it there.
Similarly, if you put it in someone else's garden who claims it to be secure along with huge pile of other ingots from other people.
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:40:38
I've read recently about hiding of coin amounts using commitments. I think it was your paper, right?
I like the idea very much but I'm concerned about the size of the transaction. 2kB seems like too much to me. Is there a way to improve this?
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:08:25
Didn't know about this. Why didn't all people switch to classic? I guess the price of it would be higher than that of hard-forked one.
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:14:12
It would be awesome if it worked with TREZOR and my own Bitcoin node.
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:06:08
I had this idea too. I was even seriously considering implementing it using CSV.
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:56:24
If you need to exchange large value you do it for a short period of time in several small chunks. That way it's improbable for you to loose the money and if you are very unlucky, you loose only one chunk.

FTFY. Your keys, your coins, their keys their coins.
@_date: 2016-08-15 14:22:37
With LN you have to periodically check until you close the channel. The period can be user-defined but it's the same as period for closing the channel uncooperatively.
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:48:21
Isn't it simpler to just show them how much you benefited?
@_date: 2016-08-18 21:18:37
There is no "average redditor" everybody is unique person with their own needs, values, desires etc.
Depends on what you want. But also, we can turn this around and see which needs Satoshi wanted to solve when he created Bitcoin and you can see if you have similar needs.
Properties of fiat money (like dollars, euros...):
* Controlled by central entity (FED, ECB...), so central entity can print as much as it wants, deny some transactions, track balances etc.
* Slow to transfer (if you pay in e-shop, the merchant knows immediately with some probability that he will be able to spend it later but he can **not** spend it immediately - it takes few days)
* Fee based on transaction volume, so it's often very high
* Government can seize the funds (like it happened on Cyprus)
The properties of Bitcoin:
* Decentralized - everybody can check network rules and reject anything that breaks them.
* First confirmation after about 10 minutes. The transaction is considered safe after one hour of waiting (6 confirmations)
* Fee is based mostly on transaction cost (how many bytes it has/how complex it is). This has nothing to do with value.
* Nobody can seize funds without private key.
Is that clear? Feel free to ask anything.
@_date: 2016-08-23 08:44:38
Thank you for detailed explanation! I didn't dig such deep into it before.
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:12:30
Which of the two methods is better? Provided that I have my own node with public IP and I want to access it from anywhere.
@_date: 2016-08-10 07:30:39
This is exactly the attack I meant.
Regarding BIP70, AFAIK Trezor supports it. I think I've seen some screenshot somewhere.
I might try it if you point me to any site implementing it. Or we could just ask @_date: 2016-08-05 16:16:55
Well, now we have good example that such walled garden is actually false sense of security.
@_date: 2016-08-18 20:54:06
You could still hide the fact that you own some Bitcoins. Or maybe with some more privacy-aware cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2016-08-25 12:36:14
Depends on purpose of your instance.
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:07:03
AFAIK qt is not required but I don't know which other wallets can import it.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:21:50
I don't think that everyone knows. How would Ethefterum hard fork work if everybody was against HF?
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:37:43
I think my comment may seemed bit extreme. I don't want to say "never ever give a penny to some exchange". I want to say "Be **very** careful when giving coins to another party."
Yeah, exchange can be trusted more than a stranger but still not ultimately. You can trade by splitting the coins into smaller chunks and sending them one chunk at a time. Keep the coins there for as little time as possible and you're fine.
Also, have you heard of bitsquare? That's much more safe, IMHO.
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:50:59
Don't forget to give them time-locked transaction!
@_date: 2016-08-19 08:37:05
They found his private key. I think it was on his laptop or server or whatever. If he had the private key encrypted and hidden somewhere, they wouldn't be able to do it. (One of the many mistakes he did.)
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:32:57
I believe it can. It's very similar to the script of payment channel. To unvault coins, you publish initiating transaction with timelock (you have to pre-create this transaction and destroy the key). The initiating transaction allows you to spend the coins after timelock expires with unvaulting key or immediately with recovery key. It may be weaker than the original suggestion but possible now.
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:17:44
The problem is that fiat transactions aren't instant.
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:39:08
Security of bitcoin isn't actually that hard:
1. Buy TREZOR (or other hw wallet **with display and physical button**)
2. Make a backup
3. Send the coins there
4. Always check carefully to whom you are sending
5. Don't send more money than you can't afford to loose. (split it in smaller parts)
Anyone can do this.
@_date: 2016-08-09 07:53:46
I guess I didn't write it clearly. I wasn't writing about responsibility (whatever that may mean). If I put my golden ingot in my garden because some random stranger **promised** you that he won't steal it and I believe him, then I have a problem.
Bitcoin was specifically designed for avoiding **believing/trusting** someone. The client is verifying all rules and requires **proof**, not a promise.
Exchange is like any other random stranger. They can claim anything they can, but unless they prove it, you shouldn't be certain. It might be **less probable** that they lie but **isn't impossible**.
@_date: 2016-08-11 06:58:34
That's just a layer above quick settlement.
@_date: 2016-08-22 16:28:30
As far as I know, one of the words is checksum and each word provides 12 bits of security (it's chosen from dictionary of 2^12 == 4096 words), which makes 12 word seed 132 bits and 24 word seed 276 bits.
Anyway, as someone else pointed out, the reason is 24!, not 2^256...
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:47:14
The correct answer is nowhere: Bitcoins don't really exist.
@_date: 2016-08-24 06:52:08
Maybe something that handles security while not being bank? Specialised security company? Or just TREZOR...
@_date: 2016-08-23 16:31:14
Of course! :)
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:41:49
Trezor was specifically designed to defend attacks on completely compromised machine. If this wasn't true, there would be no point in using it.
Of course, as long as you are always checking where (and how many of) your bitcoins go. If the malware could spoof the address, you have a problem.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:49:26
There's no way to do it because miners have to be anonymous.
@_date: 2016-04-05 10:51:04
I worry about you because blockchain.info had numerous problems. (including stolen money) It sounds to me like you are sitting on time bomb.
@_date: 2016-04-05 10:46:18
First rule of using Bitcoin: NEVER-EVER use blockchain.info as a wallet!
@_date: 2016-04-29 06:40:21
If you mean blockchain.info, that might be even worse than coinbase. They had multiple serious security problems which were obviously caused by people who were not qualified to do the job. No one knows when new security issue will cause them to go bankrupt.
Seriously, at least use some high quality wallet like Electrum, Mycelium, Bitcoin core (if you are willing to download whole blockchain), I think there is a list on bitcoin.org. At best use Trezor - hardware wallet developed by experts in this field, who care about  security.
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:16:37
Bitcoin was designed for people to be their own banks. Yes, it can have disadvantages in other ways but what is more economical, risk of your property being stolen but having slightly better usability or the other way around?
Every person must answer this question on their own. If you choose the former, Bitcoin is most probably not for you.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:55:14
If you trade Bitcoin, you have to keep it on exchange, which means you risk being Goxed. Bitcoin was designed to be trustless.
Hopefully, LN will help with this.
@_date: 2016-08-23 09:36:23
I view it more as a trick, because upgraded nodes trick non-upgraded nodes into thinking that their transactions are smaller. I'm not saying that is bad thing, it's jus an observation.
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:35:50
If you live in Europe, you might get the Trezor quickly even with cheapest option. I've got mine in three or four days (counting just delivery), if I remember correctly. But that might be because I live in neighbouring country.
Trezor was the first HW wallet that got the security right. They knew from the start that for secure payments it's necessary to use display and physical buttons. I believe they put a lot of effort into security. If you read more about it, you can see that they thought of many, many possible attacks.
I can't compare it with Ledger but all I can say is that I trust Satoshilabs.
@_date: 2016-04-26 07:48:29
Without private key, you can't spend the coins.
Many people here said that giving the key to someone else is solution. While it may be fine, thanks to bit coin being programmable, there is better way: you can give other person time-locked transaction which spends all your coins to their address(es). This way, they (or anyone who steals the transaction) can't spend your coins before certain time period during which you can cancel the transaction. In practice this means you would have to really die (or be disconnected for too long) for them to inherit your coins.
The disadvantage of this method is that you have to update the transaction every time your UTXO changes.
@_date: 2016-08-23 08:45:21
I see I remembered incorrect number.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:26:54

@_date: 2018-01-07 11:02:21
Even better: use HW wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:14:58
They can't steal your money easily, but they can break your privacy. Better upgrade it anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:23:27

Actually HW wallets are much better, because they are isolated. They completely prevent both attacks without needing any update. The fact that they don't have x86 CPU and most probably speculative execution is also interesting, although irrelevant.

So what is the problem with people who can earn a lot of money? (Assuming not by stealing.) I really don't understand why people are so envy of others. I don't care how much money other people have. It is sometimes just inspiration that if I work smart, I can have it too.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:16:45
Can't steal your money, but privacy is an issue. Upgrade anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-24 11:49:03
You are correct. I don't know about Ledger, but Trezor allows one to configure the server. Doesn't Ledger offer this feature in some settings?
AFAIK it's possible to use LN with SPV, but it might be a bit dangerous.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:59:52
Why do you think so?
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:47:24
It's a technique miners can use to gain advantage in mining approx 20% more than their competitors. (This translates to probably millions of dollars gains.) This would be fine if every miner had access to it. Problem is not everyone has the access.
Firstly the technology is patented and Bitmain has the patent, so they could leverage government to put others out of business. Secondly, ASICs with ASICboost are more difficult to design.
There are two variations of ASICboost: overt and covert. If one uses overt AB, then it's visible on the Blockchain. Covert is more difficult but not visible.
SegWit accidentally makes covert variation impossible. That's why many people believe Bitmain was against SegWit. Since BCH removed SegWit, it's expected to be controlled by Bitmain.
@_date: 2018-01-10 07:29:26

If you managed to create a "duplicate" - that is guess private key that someone else is using too, you'd find out that you are able to spend his money. This already happened in cases of broken wallets. But the chance of that happening if wallet is not broken is inexplicably small.
Using password doesn't protect you from brute force attacks in any way. It doesn't even have to. If you tried to brute force it, you'd have to spend more energy than what Sun produces during it's whole lifetime.
Password protects you from people who find your private key.

I know Lamassu better. I had even a chance to try some pentesting when the ATM came and found only a single minor issue (the victim would have to be confused). At the beginning the machine wasn't very reliable, but the owner said that customer support was good.
AFAIK these days it works pretty well. It has also a dedicated server and a connection to exchanges, so the owner doesn't risk too much.
From what I've heard it isn't making tons of money, but the owner was still surprised by the demand (the ATM isn't his main business).
The ATM is located in Bratislava.

In order to spend from paper wallet, you must put it into the computer. At that point you are vulnerable. It also has to be generated securely. HW wallet is safer.

I meant exactly the random number generator problems. What if the attack was so massive that they would not have money to refund? What if johoe was bad guy and didn't return the money?
They used javascript random() function as I've seen in the source code - bad idea.
Not checking return code of HTTP GET function - bad idea. (Did random.org provide secure connection before? If yes, why didn't they use it?)


Why didn't they use deterministic signatures?
I must admit that at least trying to mitigate flaws in Android PRNG is good thing and many developers don't even do that. But I would consider pulling randomness from sensors rather than some (potentially untrusted) web site.
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:09:28
Almost correct. It's the other way around: private key is created first and then public key is derived from private key. It's impossible to create private key from public key. If it was, anyone could do that and spend some else's coins.
Note that this was not invented by Satoshi, but existed a long time before Bitcoin was created. It secures other things too, e.g. https.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:17:31
So now people value Bitcoin, which is decentralized and impossible to be controlled by government, but a bit slow, expensive and not very private.
With LN Bitcoin will be very fast, cheap and more private. And also be able to be trustlessly exchanged with Litecoin and other cryptos.
So do you still think it will not increase value?
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:47:14
Ah, OK, that sounds reasonable.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:08:50
You don't have to run full node if you are only spending, so maybe most people will use it for spending only. My view is that not everyone has to run it - small communities (families) can share single node.

The problem with www is it's not very secure. HTTPS helps, but it's not resistant against government attacks. The point of Bitcoin is to be resistant against government attacks. The only known way to do it is probably namecoin, which unfortunately isn't popular.

AFAIK this is not the case and actually it's dependent on what response is. In other words, when a script connects to different site, the browser will allow it, but block the response if there isn't appropriate header set.

Multisig with escrow is good enough, IMHO.
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:21:40
Depends on ratio. The purpose is to verify your incoming coins. To do that you only have to download blocks from last time you ran it and then see if the payment showed up and has 6 confirmations. You can safely shut it down after you confirmed.
If you run it for shorter time than what is needed for syncing, you can't verify and then it really is pointless. If you run it long enough, it makes sense.
Actually, I've been doing this for ~6 years of using Bitcoin.

It's a network of payment channels. Payment channel is a smart contract between two people, who can transact very efficiently without possibility of one cheating another. The blockchain serves as a perfect, incorruptible judge.
Thanks to ability of forwarding payments, they can form a network. So e.g. when Alice wants to pay Carol, she pays Bob, who then forwards the payment to Carol. Again without possibility of cheating.
Of course the software will figure out a way to forward payments, so one doesn't have to do it manually.

No, you don't need full node once you received the coins. You need it only to verify that the coins you received are genuine.

Yes. You can set higher value if you want, but 550 is the minimum.

* Coercing thousands of people would be difficult
* Even if they did, those rejected transactions would route around and go through uncensored nodes. For the regulation to work, they'd have to coerce almost 100% of the network.
* Even if they somehow managed to coerce owners of nodes based on their IP addresses or whatever, people would create nodes as TOR hidden services. Since you don't need to trust node, it'd not be a problem for them, but government would be unable to identify the owners to punish.

Ah, I see now. So there are two important differences between LN and intra-exchange transfers: first, LN is still trustless, so it doesn't undermine the reason for Bitcoin existance. Second, LN works between different implementations, not just one company.

Yes, to use Bitcoin, you absolutely have to run full node. Without full node you are using "probably Bitcoin" - a token that is indistinguishable from Bitcoin most of the time, but may at some point cease to be Bitcoin (mainly in case of malicious or badly designed forks).
What you stated is correct. Most people don't run full nodes, so they are using "probably Bitcoin", not Bitcoin. Exchange users use "promise of Bitcoin". I'm not saying it's bad for them. I'm saying that they probably miss the point of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:04:30

@_date: 2018-01-03 10:58:10
I'm talking about receiving Bitcoins, not sending. Since in order to send, you must receive first, then "using bitcoin" means "receiving and sending". The definition of Bitcoin is "validated by full node". SPV nodes accept (strictly mathematically) superset of what full nodes do.
In practice it's probable that what SPV node accepted is Bitcoin. Therefore I refer to it as using "probably Bitcoin".
This is unrelated to mining.
Finally remember that SPV nodes disclose addresses the user is interested in. It's a privacy issue.

My logic is mathematical. When I say "trade all bitcoins" it means "there's no bitcoin that isn't traded". So if what you say is "trade some bitcoins" the negation is "no bitcoin is traded". That's clearly not what I said.
In simpler words: sure, trade portion of Bitcoins, if you wish. But if you trade all, you miss the important value of Bitcoin: trustlessness.

How much do you have? You don't need to store whole chain just validate it and keep the recent information, as you correctly guessed. Since validation works block-by-block, you can run full node on smaller HDD. Just set "prune=550" in the config file.

It probably wasn't from me, but I understand that anyway. Yes, there is some trust in 3rd party - just like when you trust a service provider. The interesting thing is that there is a way to do that without revealing normal transactions to the third party. So the third party monitors the blockchain and the only way they learn about the transaction is when the other end of the channel is attempting to cheat.

The section you quote talks about *on-chain* transactions. It's even outdated, since 1M limit is no longer an issue - the very same thing that enabled LN to be practical also enabled limit to double.
Also 500B transaction is quite pessimistic (I expect because of special contract). Since witnesses are discounted any special contract would have 3 times lower impact and I'd expect it to be between 300-400 bytes. The more realistic scenario would be 100M users.
Sure, that's still less than 7bln. Schnorr signatures and MAST will help. Not sure how much. And then, we can make a reasonable hardfork with consensus. The number one reason 2X HF failed is there was no consensus. I expect because of three factors: closed-door meeting, underspecified, single developer doing it part time in 6 months - LOL.

Natural absorption would only be possible if life within the state was better (which I don't believe is). Forceful absorption by coercion is a problem. What helps is the fact that overruling anarchistic society is more difficult than overruling state and the possibility that working anarchy would be example for people of neighboring states to demand more liberty.


That's exactly my point! We should change it so that owner of a land has complete control over that land. Once this is done, new experimental societies can be created and various ways of organizing society can be tried. Just as on the Internet, we can try to develop different applications and protocols and see which are good.

Sorry, I didn't wrote that clear enough, I'm not native speaker. What I meant is those other investors which can find more profitable investments can invest higher value in them and gain higher return.
What I meant is if you are unable to find anything better than holding, then just hold. Someone else will find better way, he'll increase world productivity and you gain too.


Yeah, theoretically. But let's suppose, you are going to discourage holding. How do yo do it? You have these options:
* you create an inflationary currency and force people to use it (you tall them you would take their money or throw them into jail or kill them if they won't)
* you create inflationary currency and let everybody use it
In the first case, you are being immoral. In the second case, people would be more willing use non-inflating cash because they need some sort of store of value too. If they have two currencies, one inflating, one deflating, they would go just with one deflating.

Not everyone uses KYC exchanges.


I'm sure this would lead to PoW change.


They don't. This was demonstrated several times and it's also logical implication of how verification software works. If we change the software to stop accepting blocks with old PoW and start using a new PoW, then miners can't stay mining old PoW because otherwise they would have nobody to sell the coins they mined. If they really are greedy, they will have to change the PoW too.


OK. Note that there are people working on bringing anonymity to Bitcoin too. LN will help a lot already.

Better be careful about such statements. Nobody that knows you guys even a little doubts your intentions. I also don't have any doubt about socialists not intending to destroy society, yet, they always end up doing so. See, intention != outcome. (If it did, we would probably be in a paradise.)
I think I'd be fine if the name and all associated communication clearly stated that you're just a bunch of Bitcoin supporters. I still feel uneasy about outside people eventually saying "It's an organization consisting of the best people in Bitcoin." and while such phrase would be true, it could also cause people to misunderstand. I'm not sure how to prevent it. One way I'm thinking of is for most of you to back out as official supporters and support it silently.


Some might, but I think most realize that Bitcoin withstood many attacks already. That's not a reason to not minimize the damage. And most importantly, I'm not concerned about Bitcoin. I'm concerned about you. Would be sad to lose you guys!
Regarding marketing, I see your point and I agree. Maybe separate marketing into a different organization to avoid pressure? Maybe replace "marketing" with "education" (in words, actions and intentions)?


Heh, it's clearly inside joke - but only to insiders. (Admittedly, I didn't get it at the time. I blame sickness and my brain not functioning properly. :D) That's the whole problem. Using inside jokes won't work when you want to educate noobs. (What a shame, I loooove inside jokes!)
To wrap up my response and maybe make it more constructive/positive, I want to make clear that I'm not against your effort. Actually, (just :D) do it! And do it fucking well! Do it so well, that my grandchildren will tell their grandchildren how efficiently, safely, elegantly you executed this new awesome reasonably (de)centralized operation and bring hyperbitcoinization, peace, prosperity and safety to the world years before it was supposed to happen!

By not spending, you are actually improving life of every other person because value of their coins goes up. So investors have more value to invest in.
The rule of thumb is: you should invest only if it brings you greater value, than the alternative. If you can't find anything more profitable than not spending, you are letting other people find such thing and you make them even more profitable.

Not a bad idea I think! The only obvious thing I see right now is that we would have to use an algorithm for which ASIC wasn't developed yet. Also, I'm not sure how to choose the difficulty.
It's a good point it'd have to be a separate block space, since otherwise miners would prefer paying transactions.

Inconvenient doesn't mean impossible to do. I'm programmer but quite lazy person. That's why I like Bitcoin more.
Maybe your experience is different. So I explain more differences.
When I want to pay via bank transfer, I need to do following steps:
* Open bank website in browser
* Check httpS
* type in my user ID and password (user ID is random number chosen by bank, which I can't remember, so I have to carry it with me; password can't be too secure - more than 15 chars, if I remember correctly and some chars are disabled. Paradox is that I would remember stronger password more easily.)
* open payment page
* fill in many inputs: destination account number, amount, type of payment (also called constant symbol), variable symbol, specific symbol, message for recipient (fortunately optional, but sometimes required by payee)
* confirm payment with grid card
To pay with Bitcoin I have to:
* launch Bitcoin wallet
* click "send"
* input adrress and amount
* confirm with password (no restrictions)
You still think standard banking is more convenient?

Simple: those side chains have to be mined too. There are two options: merged mining or non-merged mining. In the first case, it attracts miners to make big pools which is dangerous. In the second case, it makes sidechain weak.
Conclusion: it's insecure.
But maybe side chains can already be implemented in some similar way without changing Bictoin protocol.

Nobody criticizes trust when buying food, sending a mail or traveling by bus. Yet we criticize trust when it comes to money. Why? Because temptation to misuse this trust is too high and it was broken by government. Banks in free market used gold standard. Government destroyed gold standard.
In the whitepaper, Satoshi mentions that institutions can't avoid mediating disputes. Why wouldn't they? What would prevent someone from creating a bank and promise transaction finality? Why Satoshi didn't do just that? Government regulations.
Another proof is the message in genesis block. Another is various writings by Satoshi, that are obviously consistent with anarcho-capitalist view of the world.
Bitcoin removes the power to print money from the hands of government. That's why it's inherently anti-govenrment and it's obvious it was intended so.

This is already happening, as I mentioned above. But you must re-distribute the new key before old one expires. If you forget to send it to someone, or he didn't receive/couldn't access your message, signature becomes invalid. (because attacker could break that key)


That would require signing with old key, which becomes invalid and even if this was possible it would make expiration pointless, since attacker could change expiration date at any time.
This made me think and I found out that Bitcoin could be used also for the first key signature containing expiration date. That means, if someone has fingerprint of old key (and he knows it's correct one), he can securely find newest key. (assuming no valid revocation has been published)

You didn't research Trezor, did you?


Trezor has a display which shows user destination address and amount. Also, it requires user to press (twice) button located physically on Trezor, so application can't confirm it before user does.


It's not but it makes stealing unprofitable (attacker would spend more resources than gain).


You don't need to use exactly their algorithm. Deterministic generation of private keys based on seed and password can be done like this:
CSPRNG(SCRYPT(seed, password))
Witch is very simple using existing verified libraries.
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:17:17
Great, thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-29 22:36:30
The point of Trezor is your Bitcoins are safe even if your machine is completely compromised. The worst things virus could do is prevent you from spending or compromise your privacy.
The reasons it works are:
* private keys are generated inside Trezor
* private keys never leave Trezor (signing is done inside it)
* Trezor shows you destination address (so virus can't swap them)
* you must physically press button located on Trezor in order to confirm transaction
I've seen hardware wallets without display - those are vulnerable of course.
@_date: 2014-12-29 18:23:52
1, 2 could be solved using BTC steg:  (it doesn't use OP_RETURN and all outputs are spendable, without suspicious amounts)

Hardware switch is not needed. It could replace LED thought, but I think LED is nicer.
BUT it has to be controlled from BPU. The reason is, CPU could toggle that line so fast user wouldn't notice and he would input his password/pin into CPU application too.
The way I imagine whole process:
1. user chooses to pay in his favorite wallet
2. user enters address (scans QR code) and amount
3. user presses "Send"
4. BPU is notified through internal bus and payment information is sent to it
5. BPU switches multiplexers/de-multiplexers (and LED)
6. User checks LED and confirms amount and address
7. BPU signs transaction and sends it to CPU
8. BPU switches multiplexers/de-multiplexers back to CPU
9. CPU broadcasts the transaction

If you use Bitcoin Trezor, you can set up multiple cryptographically hidden Bitcoin wallets with plausible deniability. No one (including government) can prove that you own more of them. It works by choosing additional seed passwords. Each password unlocks different Bitcoins.
So you can have two wallets - one with let's say $20 and second with more. If someone is torturing you, you give up only first one.

For all people complaining about changetip:
Go and develop something that doesn't need so high transaction fees. Then develop browser extension which detects if user is already using Bitcoin. If he does, just send the coins to him. If not, generate new address and send him private key via private message.
While you are developing it we will use Changetip. Better something than nothing.

First few letters - bad idea. Have you heard of vanitygen?

This could be already implemented by changetip in any web e-mail like this:
* Sender installs browser extension
* When sender is trying to send e-mail, the extension parses the e-mail and checks for some magic string like 
* if string was found, extension queries changetip API and requests list of user's monikers
* extension finds amount in the text
* extension queries changetip API (httpS!!!) and requests link with secret redeem token to replace the magic string (or add it at the end of e-mail
* e-mail is sent
* receiver clicks on the link and redeems the coins (this can be automatic, if he has the extension)
* there could be one week timeout too
* e-mail addresses nor content of the e-mail is revealed to changetip - just the amount
* small transactions still free
* timeout can be implemented
* not relying on Google (or anyone else)
* users have to install the extension (which should not be a huge problem)
* it will slow down e-mail sending a little
* it's dangerous if e-mail is not sent over httpS (for this reason, extension should not allow http)
I don't mind if anyone uses my idea - I'd like it implemented but don't have time to do it myself. Maybe could do something about it?

There was a "rollback" (practically a &gt;50% attack), however this is not considered hardfork, but chain reorg. Hardfork would be something that relaxes rules (makes valid something that was previously invalid). Also, note that AFAIK no old transactions except the offending one became invalid/changed.

For small amounts Blockchain is good. For middle amounts you should use desktop client (Bitcoin core is one option, Electrum is another). For huge amounts Bitcoin Trezor is certainly good idea (it protects coins even when computer is completely compromised).
The most important thing you should understand is that using Bitcoin is not about accounts. When you install desktop client, you immediately have empty wallet set up.
In case of Bitcoin core, you can click "Receive Bitcoin", fill in description and it will create you unique address. You can have as many addresses as you want. Using different addresses can help you protect your privacy.
There are services which store Bitcoins for you but beware - they are in control of your Bitcoins! You need to trust them or don't store huge amount of Bitcoins. One of them is changetip which makes it very easy for you to send coins to other users. I have only small amount of Bitcoins stored in my changetip account for security reasons.
Good luck and feel free to ask if you have other questions!

Because we need miners to enforce correct processing of transactions. If less than 50% miners enforce it then you can't securely use the benefits of it and that makes it worthless.

If you are using N of N, you can just use k1 = random(); k2 = k XOR k1; ...
It's not actually SSSS, but better than nothing. Also to do 2 of 3, you can use this (for all ki[j]: len(ki[j]) == len(k)):
k1[0] = random(); k1[1] = random();
k2[0] = random(); k2[1] = k1[0] XOR k;
k3[0] = k1[1] XOR k; k3[1] = k2[0] XOR k;
To redeem k from k1, k2 you do k = k1[0] XOR k2[1]; and so on
Of course, this wastes space but it's easy to implement (almost fool proof). For 2 of 3 it shouldn't be huge problem.
Generally, you need length l of subkeys for any m of n: l = n!/(m!(n-m)!) * len(k)

@_date: 2017-02-19 22:54:57
The seed **is your private key**. It's in different form but still it allows you to spend coins.
Exactly how it works: seed is just a bunch of random numbers (represented as 24 words). From this, individual private keys are derived using mathematical operations. From individual private keys, individual public keys are generated and from them addresses. This is one-way process and impossible to reverse.
If you use the same seed multiple times, each time the same set of keys and addresses is generated. So backing up the seed is enough to backup all private keys. HW wallets don't show the individual keys because they are not necessary and could create confusion.
Cryptosteel contains enough letters to create all possible seeds.
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:08:30
Then we will have to use time based steganography. Slow as hell but at least something.
@_date: 2015-01-12 01:01:47
You could ask for signature of related address.
@_date: 2015-01-18 08:46:41
Because the latter is sort of possible. (I'm not sure if anyone else found out how or just me.) Sort of == for use with cryptocurrencies.
In other terms, you can have person A transfer certain file to person B if B knew it's content some time before in a way that atomically releases funds to person A and (symetric) publishes cryptographic key, allowing B to decrypt the content. (Assuming content is either public or was encrypted with B's key before encrypting by A)
Little modification is possible in order to allow transfer from A to B via C .(C is provider; A and B are cooperating, behind NAT)

@_date: 2016-03-31 08:24:08
The idea seems great, but this implementation suffers some serious problems.
First, it's costly to verify randomness of private key (you have to break the seal). It could be done more cheaply if, instead of hashing, user-provided randomness with noise it did EC addition of provided randomness with generated randomness. That way user would firstly read the point iG (i is internal randomness) then provided it with e (external randomness) and calculated that resulting public key equals eG + iG and that device knows private key.
This should be done automatically with some open-source (publicly auditable) software. This would also ensure that entropy is good (user didn't provide file full of zeros).
Another problem would be if someone colludes with the manufacturer and they create special device which is not random (all others are random). I can't imagine how to overcome this problem. (Maybe require that many people provide randomness and sign the public points?)
I think that it might be possible to achieve what they want but their current version is not secure enough.
Finally, how do we know it doesn't contain a backdoor?

@_date: 2015-01-12 19:36:47
Well, I wasn't accurate. These are differences:
* Coinbase - never accepted by other network for obvious reasons
* Transactions with input already spent on that chain
All other transactions should be valid on both chains. (I may miss some)
Suppose, attacker A wants to take advantage of fork. He creates two transactions from same UTXO to different addresses. He sends one to old version nodes and second one to new version nodes. So one gets included in one chain and second in other. Each chain rejects the other TX.
Then he spends from new version chain on exchange running new version. For money he receives, he buys coins on old chain and he can repeat this.
If old chain wins, people doing business with him on new chain loose the coins (they get invalidated). If the other chain wins, he loses only TX fees, which aren't too high.

@_date: 2015-01-18 11:17:17


In this case, Trezor is probably better. You create first password protected account and fill it wit your life savings. You create second account with **different password but same seed** and fill it with some junk coins. Then, when government tortures you to give up the password, you give up second one. They have no way to prove (or even know) you have another password.
Also, you can create 100 accounts each with different password known only by you.
BTW, I believe probability of stealing your coins by firmware is about same as probability of stealing your coins by infected computer. (even in case of Linux Live CD)

While nice in theory, there is a problem with such claims: in short, the Bitcoin miners don't just stamp history, they also verify it. They literally attack incorrect versions of history (double spendings, wrong signatures, generating coins out of nowhere). But those miners which don't merge-mine don't care about rules in other chains and that means they don't add any security. On the contrary, if less than 50% Bitcoin miners are convinced to merge-mine some other coin, that other coin is even less secure because it uses same algorithm so it's cheap for those miners to attack it (they already have the hardware). Though I must admit merge mining may be way to attract current miners.
Saying that any feature can be simply added to Bitcoin is true in theory but very ridiculous in practice - just look at block size problem.
Explanation why merge mining doesn't work against double spending attack in weaker chain:
Let's say there is merge-mining altcoin with it's own rules (e.g. Ethereum rules). This altcoin has less than 50% of Bitcoin, let's say 40% and there is attacker which has 60% of that hash power - which equals to 24% of Bitcoin hash power. Now, the attacker can't attack the Bitcoin, but he can still double-spend on alt coin and the fact that it's merge-mined won't prevent him doing so.
If he mines new block which would be considered as invalid by alt coin but it's valid Bitcoin block (those 60 % non-merge-miners see just hash in coinbase and don't care what it means) it will be happily accepted by Bitcoin network and mined upon. While full validating nodes can filter invalid blocks out, they still face one decision: if the miner mines two blocks which conflict by alt coin rules but are both valid by Bitcoin rules how do they decide which of them is valid by their rules?
They know which of them was mined sooner, so they may accept just first of them, the last or ignore that information. 
Now, accepting last one is obviously wrong.
Accepting the first seems OK at first, but then attacker could pre-mine block containing transaction to himself, keep it secret and publish just hash of alt coin block. Bitcoin network would accept that but alt coin network would be unable to validate it so it would have to reject it and continue mining on some other block. Now attacker could spend his alt coins, receive something for it and later reveal his block, which would immediately overwrite his transaction with previous one.
Finally the alt coin network can ignore ordering in Bitcoin and just calculate PoW. This effectively makes merge-mining useless in terms of security, because the Bitcoin PoW isn't actually used.

I guess you're being sarcastic. Here is schematic: 
I call Bitcoin processor BPU and standard processor CPU.
If logic 1 is supplied through Control line, BPU is disconnected AND CPU is connected AND LED shines.
There's no way to make LED NOT shine AND CPU being connected. User knows he is interacting with Bitcoin wallet when LED doesn't shine. (inverted logic would be probably better and can be achieved easily by switching BPU and CPU wires)
Similar circuit is possible for input.

Air-gaped computer as you describe should be fine. However, most people do not understand the importance of it. If the computer is compromised, no encryption will help. (Because a malware can steal the password too.)
Three decoy words per seed word means two bits of entropy. (The attacker is choosing one word from four.) For 24 words it means 2^48 == 281474976710656 combinations.
If one billion combinations can be tried per second (reasonable guess) then the seed can be guessed in 3.26 days. Not very secure...

I just realized I wrote that piece a little ambiguously. Many gun proponents argue that more guns means less violence because of self-defense. I believed this too.

There seems to be little correlation between gun ownership and violence.

From what I thought I understand signature verification algorithm had to be run for each key and generate new hash for that key because the hash was different due to containing other signatures.
Segwit separates signature data, so there is only one hash and that hash needs to be verified `m` times, where `m` is number of signatures (inputs). So if transaction is `n` bytes that would be O(n + m) but `m` is directly limited by size of transaction, so we can safely assume O(n + n) == O(2n) == O(n).
Clearly I must be missing something. What is it?

The latter. Of course, it's not as powerful as Ethereum but there's also much smaller chance of being vulnerable.
The Bitcoin transaction can perform some simple verifications like (in pseudo code):
    if signature_is_valid(signatureA) {

    } else if signature_is_valid(signatureB) and x = hash(y) {
        unlock_money()

This is very accurate description of how pools work.
One side note: to check whether the miners are actually mining and not just claiming to do so (and how much work they provide), miners also send solutions for lower difficulty/higher target. That means if network has target 100000 and pool has target 1000000, then miner send solution to pool central server if he finds hash 500000 because it's lower than 1000000 to prove to the server that he at least tried to find something.

If anybody knew it, he would be super-rich. My guess is it's a bubble now, so it will go down for some time only to rise even higher. Probably the best strategy is buying small amounts every month or so.
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:06:34
I consider it being valid concern. If I open million channels 0.01 BTC each and move value to the other side of the channel (one way to do it is to send to myself via LN), then It might be profitable for me to get 51%, publish old txs and censor punishing transactions.
I don't have a solution from top of my head but I believe such attack would be visible in network and it may force all users to close channels just in case and stop using them.
The other thing is if I had too many channels and cheat all of them, not all might be able to punish me. How many channels would I need to be profitable?
Let's assume each channel locks same amount of value, blocksize is 1MB, we have empty blocks, timeout is set to two weeks - 2016 blocks and each punishment tx has size 0.5 kB (pessimistic guess, in reality 0.3 kB might be more than enough).
That means 2016*1000000/500 == 4032000 peers will punish me, so I'd have to open twice that many channels to break even.
Suppose each channel locks value of 0.1 BTC. Then about 26 week (6 months) timeout is enough to guarantee I can't profit because I'd hit 21 million BTC cap.
The block size will be raised probably and it will make this kind of attack even harder. Consider that one person owning 10.5 million bitcoins is very unlikely, I calculated with pessimistic TX size and didn't account for Segwit and lost coins. I find this kind of attack very unlikely.
Also even if one entity controlled half of all bitcoins, some of the victims would be miners and they might artificially extend the timeout (by blocking my transactions) because it's in their interest.

When compared to software being run or PC or smartphone, the most important advantage is it's *very* simple device. Since it's simple, it's much less probable it contains an exploitable bug.
Operating systems (whether they are running on PC or smartphone) are too complex to be reliably secure (there were many vulnerabilities in them).
[Trezor]( is designed in such way that even if you have completely compromised computer, your Bitcoins will be still safe. It's because Trezor never sends private information to computer.
There are other hardware wallets for Bitcoin apart from Trezor but I believe Trezor is the best alternative. They have some extra security features, all code is open to security review and they are well established members of security and Bitcoin community.
If you are looking into purchasing, maybe it'd be better to first purchase small amount and play with it a little to learn the most important concepts. When you are confident and want to buy large amount, you should buy Trezor.
You can find some basics of Trezor usage in [my other comment]( All other details are published on [their website](

Yes and no. First let's consider only solo miners. Two solo miners always try to solve different blocks - they differ at least in coinbase transaction - the on generating bitcoins. (They are different because they determine who gets the coins.) Since they are different, a nonce which produces valid block for one miner produces invalid block for other miner.
Now let's consider mining pool. Mining pool is a group of miners which agree to mine same block and share the reward based on how much work each of them provided. The pool operator coordinates miners. Since it'd be wasteful to repeat hashing, he (automatically - using computer and appropriate software) assigns a range to mine for each miner. So for example miner  tries nonces 0-1000000, miner  tries 1000000-2000000 etc.
As we can see, they use mechanism to avoid duplication of work but they don't send a single message for each "string" they try.

Strictly speaking, they are whatever-coinbase-decides-coin users. Coincidentally, that coin is now indistinguishable from bitcoin but it may become different at any time.
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:12:20


Actually, not quite. The mining would be possible without nonce too. For example by reordering transactions in block or by re-generating keypair for coinbase transaction.
Nonce just makes it more simple. If you hash same thing two times, same hash comes out. To find hash which is lower than target you have to try many *different* inputs. The easiest thing to generate different input is just increase none by one.
The nonce is basically a number in lottery. Correct one wins 12.5 bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-01-02 09:17:36
Well, nothing is 100% safe and perfect. Bitcoin itself had some serious bugs before.

* Size of non-witness data &lt;= 1MB.
* Complies other rules...

This file contains all **private** information you need to spend the coins. You should back it up on some USB drive. (Don't give it to other people!)
Regarding creating backup every time, it depends on version of Core it was first created. I think you can check it by running Core with -usehd=1. If it refuses the argument, you have to backup regularly (every 100 keys generated). If it launches without complaints, you need only one backup.
Still I think it'd be more secure to just use Trezor if you have many coins.

@_date: 2017-01-08 13:28:31
The most recent version creates HD wallet, so you don't have to backup each time.
The core has two modes of operation. The older was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto himself. It pre-generates 100 secret (private) keys and a Bitcoin address for each one. So after you backup, you have 100 keys backed up. If you use all the keys, new 100 keys are generated, so you need to backup again.
New mode is called HD wallet (also known as BIP32). It uses clever cryptography to generate single piece of private data, from which all addresses are generated. Therefore, you need to backup just that piece, often represented as 12-24 English words. (In case of Core, it's also wallet.dat file.)

The problem is that the language allows mixing attackers and victims code in such way, so victim pays for the execution of the code which infinitely sends the money to attacker until victim is out of money. At that point, only last operation is considered failed and previous operations (transferring of funds from victim to attacker) remain performed.

Unless some soft-fork unknown to me was performed, the ordering of independent transactions within a block doesn't matter except for coinbase which must always be at the beginning.
I'm not sure about dependent transactions within block (one spends output of other). I guess it might be understandable that first transaction must go first for efficiency reason as well as simplicity of implementation. I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case.

When you keep your coins at exchange and it gets attacked, you loose the coins. Permanently. Solution: don't keep it there. If you have private keys in your computer and you get some malware, your coins are lost. Permanently. Solution: use hardware wallet (such as Trezor).

Thank you! It's funny how they think that accumulating capital causes boom/bust cycles.
However, I think it'd be quite reasonable to charge fee `q*total_outputs_size`, to internalise costs of keeping blockchain. (That's of course much, much different than trying to do zero interest.)

It'd be awesome if those were the only variables in equation. Unfortuantelly, it's not the case. :(


* Bigger blocks are more costly to process and therefore it creates pressure to create pools (where only pool operator validates and so the cost is shared between participants). This is not very huge issue in my opinion because miners are likely to disconnect from misbehaving pool (else they might find their mining equipment worthless)
* Bigger blocks increase latency, which puts smaller miners at disadvantage, because they learn about new blocks later. (The sooner the miner learns about the block the better for him - he wastes resources while he doesn't know about the new block.)
* If the cost of operating full node is too high, only few people fully verify the blockchain and so it's more vulnerable to various attacks. (It's basically the same problem as with validating bank notes - fake notes could get through few hops until their illegitimacy is discovered.)


It will take some time for people to upgrade and use SegWit, so not 7 days, but still, fees should slowly drop (unless there is a huge influx of new users)


I can't predict the future. I tired Eclair wallet.
* simple interface
* clear distinction between channels and "normal coins"
* has bugs (I couldn't open a channel)
* still uses long hexastrings
I think something usable might be out until end of this year, but I'm not sure.

Ouch, I'd probably shit myself keeping 8 BTC on anything else than Trezor. I have much less bitcoins yet I bought Trezor, just in case.
Reusing old addresses is highly discourage by most (all?) people in community. One problem with it is it can de-anonymize you. Other problem is any attacker immediately know how much coins you have and might specialize to attack you. Third is that if quantum computers ever become a thing, it'll be much easier to attack reused addresses than unused addresses. I'd personally stop using old address (and any used address).
I'm not an expert on bc.info internals but I guess they generated one private key for you a long time ago and it was only later when HD wallets became popular, so they implemented it too.
The phrase is something called seed because many addresses can be safely generated from it. It's done in such way to be infeasible to link separate addresses. Therefore if all your coins are on addresses generated from that phrase, you just need to backup that phrase.
But anyway, getting Trezor and sending everything to it would probably not be just safer but also save you hassle. It's designed to just work. It has phrase recovery too, so as long as you back it up safely, you don't need to worry about security too much. (Of course, you should still read a thing or two but it's much more simple than anything else with comparable security.)

It's not Turing complete contracts like in ETH, but you can still do interesting things.
In case of inheritance contract, the assumption is that if you don't access Internet for some time (e.g. 3 months), you are very likely dead.
So the solution is to create a chain of transaction such that if inheritor broadcasts first one, he can spend the money after some time, if nobody declines the transaction for some time (3 months). Since the only person capable of declining such transaction is dead, it will become spendable by inheritor.
@_date: 2016-06-04 16:51:05
Yeah, that could work. Also, there would have to be a way for those setting up the records to be informed about the necessity of DNSsec. I mean, if person who doesn't know that DNSsec is necessary registers domain name without the support, that would suck a lot.
Also, it would have to use stealth address, due to privacy issues and stealth addresses are not widespread enough. :(

Things that are high-quality are usually worth paying for. That being said, if you ask for cheap/free HW wallet, you probably don't have enough money for it to make sense (at most few hundreds of bucks I guess, right?)
In that case, the cheapest, while quite secure method is to download Tails OS and boot it every time you need to spend money (it has Electrum pre-installed). Take care of your seed - back it up!
When Bitcoin is worth so much you'll have thousands dollars, you can buy Trezor directly with fraction of your coins.

Bigger blocks have their costs: centralization risk, bigger resource requirements, ... If bigger blocks were strictly better, nobody would object to it in the first place.
SegWit brings 2× increase already. SegWit2x (ironically) proposes 4× increase. Also LN might cause need for block space to decrease so much that SegWit 2x will be irrelevant (but we don't know until it's tried).

The other side has two options: give a chance and wait or close the channel unilaterally (in this case waiting is involved because it might be revealed that closing is cheating). The funds can't be lost permanently.


Person B can find another way to receive the blockchain (e.g. via satellites), find offending transaction and punish A for doing that by taking all the coins from channel.
I recommend reading on it. It's actually really simple. Feel free to ask further questions.

What you wrote is correct and a very good idea.
@_date: 2017-01-14 21:46:21
For example: instead of creating digital signature, you transmit "private keys" via dubious channels every time you make transaction. You give permission to pull unspecified amount from your account to unspecified people. It scares me every time...
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:11:20
LN users will lose money only if there are too many cheating closes of channels or if users are unwilling to pay high enough fee. I believe both cases are quite unlikely in practice. Time will tell.

Nice. If you have large amount of money, you should consider buying Trezor. It's very secure and also very simple.
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:54:34
Unless you have hardware backdoor...
@_date: 2016-11-18 10:56:49
Trezor. You can check the transaction before signing, you have physical buttons to confirm, very clever pin code system and ability to password-protect the backup. It also works as U2F and has other nice features.
@_date: 2017-08-06 08:17:50
Yes, but in that case, the transaction is not considered confirmed. There's a reason people wait 6 blocks.
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:30:08
The reason to back up Trezor is the same as with other devices: if you loose Trezor and don't have backup all your coins are gone.
When you are setting up Trezor (connect first time to PC) it shows you 24 english words called seed. This seed is all you (or an attacker!) need to access all bitcoins as well as history (information about past transactions). You have to write those words down on a paper (or preferably something more durable) and store it somewhere safe, ideally at more **geographically different** locations (so if e.g. your house burns down, you have another backup).
**Never-ever enter your seed into computer unless you are doing recovery!**
It is the same thing as backing up hard drive (in principle - just copying information), but you have to do it manually - fortunately with much, much less data. :)
If you want to be more confident, you can set up an additional password so the seed alone isn't enough. If someone found your seed, he couldn't spend your money without knowing the password. On the other hand if you forget it, it's game over too. Ideally, you could write that password too and hide it *at different location*.
Also, depending on how much you trust your relatives, you might wish to tell them the location of seed and password, so if you die, they can inherit your coins. (If you don't tell them, your money will be just lost.)
If you are very paranoid, you might consider [Cryptosteel]( instead of paper.
I hope it helps. If you need some more help feel free to write.

I guess that the wallet created a new, empty address for you to increase your privacy and you just put that one there. The other address is hidden somehow. One way to find out is simply moving coins to a new address (this will cost you TX fee). The wallet might have an option to view all addresses. If it doesn't, you probably need to export private keys (or seed) and import it to different wallet which has such option. This will cost you only the time.

How do you transfer data necessary for signing? Via USB flash drives? USB flash drivers may have vulnerabilities and OS can have vulnerabilities too, because it's very complex system. On the other hand, Trezor is designed to be very simple, to avoid bugs.
I can imagine sending raw transaction over UART to well-written and analyzed parser/signer, but if you have resources to implement it, you have also resources to buy Trezor and it'll cost you less.

That text is incorrect (or imprecise). Blocks being full doesn't mean no transaction will pass through. There are *transactions* in full blocks after all.
It's only about the fees. The attempt will work only if the other party can't afford to pay high enough fee to get into block before deadline. This can be easily solved by parties having policy to never accept so much money from the other party that would make the balance of other party go below fees.
In theory, an attacker could close so many channels that not all of them would get into block. This attack is extremely difficult, because the attacker would lose huge amount of money. The attacker would have to have many bitcoins locked in channels. He would lose part of those coins and theoretically gain other coins.
In order to be profitable, an attacker would have to make traffic that is at least twice as big as blockchain throughput. If current block size allows for 3tps, the attacker would have to close (cheat) at least 6 channels per second for as long as the longest channel timeout.
If timeout is two weeks, the attacker would have to close about 3.63M channels. If each node requires at least 7BTC to be locked in the channel, then this attack is obviously impossible, because there is not enough coins in circulation.

First of all Trezor is open to public review. If you don't trust it, you verify it. (And some people did.)
Secondly, the device is purposefully very simple, so it's much easier to verify it (as opposed to very complex operating systems etc).
Thirdly, device generates new private key when you initialize it.
Finally Trezor is made by very trustworthy people. I have all reasons to believe that they do it right. They have multisig set up, so several people would have to collude to create bad firmware.
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:36:55

@_date: 2016-06-25 12:06:59
I was "pro-fee" person but after reading your post, I see lot of sense in low-cost transactions. I believe that SegWit + Lightning will help i, thought.
@_date: 2016-11-16 16:24:41
Maybe because of upcoming Bitcoin black friday?
@_date: 2016-11-02 08:24:36
Yeah, I was thinking about running it. But now I'm unsure if it's worth trying, because with SegWit it might become useless.
@_date: 2016-11-18 14:57:47
I'm very happy to see you advocating Bitcoin to stop wars, govs, corruption etc. I have similar goals and I feel hopeful, because there are people like you, who actually understand what Bitcoin is, why it was designed and take their time to educate people and help them out.
I believe that we can achieve this world without (many of) these things that make living less pleasant. I see you did lot of work already. What do you think about improving efficiency a little? I'd suggest to try to understand the people you are communicating with and try to reply "in their language".
For example, I tried to imagine how person called "moron" could feel. I think that the person might get angry and it's usually hard to reason with angry person. I certainly agree that such person is taking huge risk and I wish such person good luck realizing that before he loses anything.
Maybe saying to him something like "I think you are taking huge risk. There were many incidents when people thinking like you lost money. I believe it would be much safer for you to move your Bitcoins to your own wallet." instead of "moron" could help. What do you think?
To be clear, I don't think you're somewhat bad person or troll or whatever for writing like that. And I'm not pope/Mother Teresa/whoever to boss you, call it bad thing or whatever. I just saw you're trying to help those people and that sometimes those people have hard time to see that. So that's my suggestion to try out. Of course, you have your free will, do as you like. :)
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-01-11 20:50:52
Of course, hardware backdoors are possible. If I wanted extremely high security, I'd buy several (at least two) Trezors with different identities and try to not have them from single batch. Then I'd randomly choose half of them, take apart and analyzed. If I find backdoor, others are probably backdoored too. If not, then I'd have to be very unlucky to choose the clean ones, so I may assume, they're not. Then I could do multisig with them to increase the security further.
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:00:08


@_date: 2016-11-18 09:42:56
It doesn't mean anything. Miners just didn't upgrade yet and unless you are one of them, you can not know whether they will or won't do it.
@_date: 2016-11-18 12:02:57


bci is the worst place. They had serious security vulnerabilities several times. They are lucky that they didn't bankrupt yet.
@_date: 2016-11-21 17:20:12
That would make sense. Still, Segwit is still more efficient (it's still 1k compared to 1k^2). I don't think it'd be good idea to artificially limit size of transactions, because we might need larger transactions in the future (just as we need non-malleable transactions now).
@_date: 2016-11-22 08:33:26
Good points. I agree.
@_date: 2016-11-19 10:54:31


I don't have so much experience to know whether this is true for sure. I experienced when some people said things like "lazy", "selfish" etc to me and I couldn't admit it. Later I realized they have some point. So obviously it might work. On the other hand, how can I know what impact would other words do?
So, honestly, I don't know. I used these words many times during my lifetime and I decided to change it to see what the result would be. (Believe me, it's harder than it seems.) So far I feel it works quite well but I need more experience.
Of course, not everybody will agree with us every time and even if they will, for some people it takes much more time than for others. I believe that the environment they lived in influences it very much. For example, it took much less time for my girlfriend to become anarchist than it took for me. :)
There's one thing however, why I believe most people will understand one day. Many huge misconceptions in history were overthrown by truth at some point. Take for example flat/round Earth, or morality of slavery (if you don't include the state). So I'm hopeful this will happen again. :)
@_date: 2016-12-18 23:19:41
On the other hand, it might be considered public key when you look at it from right perspective. It's used for signature verification...
@_date: 2016-11-22 07:44:29
Ah, that makes sense and it'd probably help. The biggest question in my opinion is whether segwit will buy us enough time to implement Schnorr signatures. I yes, I'd prefer implementing it before any block size increase (decreasing storage requirements is better than increasing storage).
I don't know what the developers plan but I they thought about something similar, I can understand them.
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:28:44

Because segwit also solves O(n^2) problem. I'm all pro scaling after segwit.
@_date: 2016-11-18 12:01:44
Keeping coins outside of your wallet is bad idea. Keeping them at blockchain.info is even worse. They had serious security vulnerabilities several times. I wouldn't be surprised if they encounter another one.
@_date: 2016-11-11 12:29:05
In (hopefully) simple words: every transaction has unique identifier calculated from content of that transaction. Currently you can create two transactions with same meaning (which coins go where) and different identifiers. The problem is known as "transaction malleability" and prevents security of some contracts. After segwit, it will be possible to create non-malleable transaction. This will enable lightning network and other awesome protocols/smart contracts.
@_date: 2016-11-07 14:40:15
Miners might be also cheaper. (I've no clue whether it's true.) Also, I'm not sure about maximum temperature in case of heat pump (can it boil water?). Size might matter too. (All heat pumps I've seen so long were quite big. I can't imagine using it for making tea. But I can imagine using ASIC for this.)
In cases someone has miner already (and no heat pump) it might be interesting too.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:59:50
Alright, thanks for the link!
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:44:38
The goal fo BIP148: activate SegWit by forcing all miners to signal, beginning August 1st.
What happened: all miners were signalling SegWit, even before August 1st.
Conclusion: BIP148 supporters got what they wanted. That should be probably considered success.


This depends entirely on hash power of that chain.


I did. That means this statement isn't true.


I don't know, ETC still lives, so maybe BIP148coin would too?
@_date: 2016-12-19 07:50:20
That's true. It's just especially obvious in case of Venezuela.
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:40:16
Both Bitcoin Cash and Bcash are incorrect. IT should be called Bitmaincoin.

That would still be three chains. Which isn't different from the current situation (except that Core version would be probably better).
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:10:08
By your logic, I could convince all miners to mine 42M bitcoins.

What exactly do you mean? The bureaucracy is too high?
@_date: 2016-11-07 00:43:24
Two things to keep in mind:
Using [heat pump]( *might* be cheaper than ASIC (it's hard to predict but maybe someone has insight on this).
Sometimes there is more electricity produced than can be consumed and it's difficult to reduce it. This energy needs to be consumed somehow and ASICs might be very good way to do it.
But it might change things anyway.
@_date: 2017-01-25 08:26:32
They could ask them? Or the pool could have publicly available "kindness policy" so miners don't join the pool if they don't agree.
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:55:45
I don't. The question is, who did if not Bitmain?
@_date: 2016-11-16 00:26:39
If you have some coins already (at least 0.1B), try Bitsquare. In other cases, localbitcoins, Mycelium trading, some ATM around your place...
@_date: 2016-11-14 10:37:32
Why do you think so?
@_date: 2016-11-19 10:59:19


I agree. Unless Coinbase data is leaked, it's quite safe. On the other hand, Bitcoin was created to lessen the need for these kinds of services, because central storage of wealth is fragile.

@_date: 2017-08-01 04:49:33


They still need to "upgrade" all software


I see at least three. Miner centralization, absence of SegWit (it isn't just for LN/low fees, it has more uses!), worse developers.
@_date: 2016-11-19 10:23:43


I agree. Regarding address, how do you know to who the address belongs?






I understand what you mean. The thing is that I consider Trezor the most secure HW wallet, but it still might have bugs. So instead of putting all of my coins on other wallet than Trezor "just because I want to diversify user base" I suggest to just use more HW wallets with multisig. I believe that all coins on multisig(Trezor+Ledger+Whatever) is stronger than 1/3 coins on Trezor + 1/3 coins on Ledger+1/3 coins on Whatever.
@_date: 2016-11-16 00:21:06
OK, seems legit, thank you!

Miners could also run LN node. (It's probably profitable for someone who has Full node already.)
@_date: 2016-11-14 11:08:42

@_date: 2017-01-05 13:40:42
Blockchain.info has a history of awful security vulnerabilities. I recommend to not keep there more than small amount of coins (like $10).
@_date: 2016-11-11 12:10:39
You can already create transactions which can be included into blockchain only after some period of time. So you can have software to pre-create transactions for your relatives which, after broadcasting, will allow them to spend the money after some time.
If you are still alive and you notice the transaction in the blockchain, then you can cancel it within that time period. If you are dead, nobody will cancel it and they can use the coins then.
The way it would be represented in UI is that you'd enter address(es) of your relatives and timeout and the rest could be handled for you.
However, transaction malleability makes this setup insecure. Segwit fixes transaction malleability and thus enables this protocol to work.
BTW it can be very conveniently combined with payment channels, so your relatives could take money out of payment channels as well and this would even improve some issues. Edit: It should work with hardware wallets too (if they provide support).
Keep in mind though, that if you don't write a testament (saying that you want the money to be inherited via blockchain), one of your relatives could still use government force to sue other relative, as Pamela Morgan said to me.
@_date: 2016-11-16 13:30:35

If block reward is public knowledge, what prevents anyone from ignoring blocks with unexpected reward? Why would anyone *not* ignore such blocks?


If this was true SegWit would be activated two weeks after deployment.

The Onecoin isn't crypto currency and here are simple facts that distinguish crypto currency from scam:
* Bitcoin and other proper crypto currencies have public source code, public blockchain and stand-alone software for connecting to network and verifying that the rules of the currency weren't broken. On the other hand, Onecoin has no public source code, no blockchain and no way to verifying the numbers and rules.
* Proper currencies allow you to transact freely, without limits, boundaries and borders. Onecoin imposes maximum withdrawal limit.
* There exist multiple independent exchanges for Bitcoin and other crypto currencies. There is only single one authorized exchange for Onecoin.
Onecoin is clearly scam and that money is gone. I wish you and your family good luck not being pulled into problems.
Finally, if you want to improve communication with your father, I suggest researching "Non-violent communication" (and a book with the same name). It greatly helped me with my relationships, however it's not magic pill and it takes time. Also I find it hardest to apply it when communicating with my family. (I still struggle with it.)
@_date: 2016-11-02 10:17:44
Because the lightning channels already obfuscate transactions (they are encrypted, handled peer-to-peer, not published into blockchain). There's even TOR-like routing (planned or already developed - I'm not sure).
However, there could be a theoretical de-anonymization attack in cases when someone forcefully closes channel (to reveal hash pre-image). So I'm not sure if Joinmarket can be used for it.
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:34:24
I guess you might be on a restricted network - happened to me few times. In that case, you may install TOR (not TOR browser, but TOR itself!) and then in settings set your node to use it. It will circumvent the restrictions.
@_date: 2016-12-20 19:46:30
Of course. Unless you don't want government to hijack your connection, supply fake TLS certificates and fake money...

If you choose such PIN, you might have a bigger problem...
Trezor even allows longer PINs (I'm not sure how long, but I think that 10 digits should work), securely enforces increasing delay between pin entries.
But what's more important, you can check the amount and address on the display. The display is also used for showing you backup seed. (How do you even backup Ledger Nano?)
I don't believe Ledger Nano is or could be more secure than Trezor.

@_date: 2017-08-04 06:57:00
If you have addresses somewhere, you could make a contract with them, so they can't move them. The only problem is that you could scam them if you actually had the keys.
@_date: 2016-11-18 10:50:22
Yes. And it is still more secure because the attacker would have to create fake accounts and let people send them Bitcoins. I assume, if this ever happened, few people would lose money. And there is even upper limit on single exchange.
@_date: 2016-11-18 11:12:51
If you store low volume, then few (if any) people would be incentivized to attack you. If you store large amount, hardware wallet should be no-brainer. Hardware wallet is easy enough for anyone. Just make a backup, set strong PIN and you are done.

Good for you! I hope they won't yell at you if they buy and price suddenly falls.
About a year ago my GF told me she wants to buy Bitcoins. I was afraid that she might be angry if the price falls after that so I made very clear, explicit statement that she's buying at her own risk and made sure she's aware there's no guarantee of it rising. She accepted the risk...
Good luck!
@_date: 2016-11-16 17:05:26
I understand those people who don't get it. Inflation is hard to measure, because pieces rise quite slowly. On the other hand, numbers expressed directly are easy to compare. (Even though comparison might be actually incorrect.) Few people have interest in looking at charts of currencies and comparing inflation of different currencies.
But I have hope, that truth will come out eventually. Sooner or later more and more people will realize it, especially when the gap between them and those who use non-inflationary currencies start to get bigger.
@_date: 2016-12-20 08:36:51
Now it's 100G sw :D
It's like with gold: you have to verify that you've received gold, not something else. Or with notes: running full node is like buying and using a validator.
Of course you can rely on trust or third party but that's exactly what bitcoin was designed to avoid.

Do you know about O(n^2) problem? There is a bug in Bitcoin which causes nodes to do n^2 operations when verifying blocks of size n. That means, if we doubled block size, the cost of computation would increase four times.
This is fixed by segwit.
This is why I believe it's better to *wait* until segwit is there. Then we can increase block size.
@_date: 2016-11-16 00:29:31

Another problem is that if the network currently went from 1000 to 10000 (10 times) the maximum processing cost would increase 10^2 == 100 times. That is being fixed with Segwit (which also enables LN, so Segwit truly is the best scaling solution we have right now).

Several people already suggested thing, so I would add just my suggestions:
* Don't put all the amount on exchange at once - buy it in parts (e.g. one Bitcoin at a time)
* Each time you buy, send from exchange to **hardware waller** (this can't be stressed enough), wait for confirmations in blockchain (ideally 6, but no for sure less than 3) and only after it's confirmed you buy next part.
* If you fear that exchange could send you fake coins, you have to use full node (takes long time to sync but might be worth it).
* If you fear that exchange could run with your money, use something else (localbitcoins, bit square, etc).
@_date: 2016-11-16 13:28:23

Even if you want to debunk their claims, as Luke demonstrated, it's possible to count nodes even when they aren't listening.

That is only for altruists that want to help others. Verifying transactions doesn't require listening.

Robust architectures usually don't have values hard-coded, therefore, there should be something like `const double tax_rate = 0.2;` somewhere...

Is there really so widespread problem that renters destroy houses? (serious question)
@_date: 2016-11-18 10:46:45
I agree 100% with what you say. I can't understand why those people keeping large amount of bit coins take such risk, when they can cheaply create their own wallet.
I've read that you are experienced bitcoiner. I'd like to understand better what's your goal of writing these comments. Do you want to help others? Do you want to just vent?
If you wonder, this is serious question, I really am interested what's your need that you're trying to fulfill.

You may consider using Core anyway to validate that coins you received are entirely valid. (Just as you could use bill validator for paper bills.) The Core is actually the most secure wallet in this regard.
Of course, for small amount it's not a big deal.

Sure, wars, slavery, poverty... That's what people get in exchange for taxes.

The problem is that since difficulty doesn't change it still requires the miner to spend the same amount of electricity on mining. So no profitability change until 2016 blocks are mined.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:32:59
Sounds too risky to me though...
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:16:25
Yes, that can be used too. Having it both ways is still better because it can protect against reorg attacks too.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:47:05
We already have bigger blocks and they aren't even on full capacity!

I really like your post, as many others, I was surprised by high quality of your writing. Open-mindedness of your parents is really fascinating and extremely valuable. There are very few parents like yours.

If the machine is the same shown in the picture, then it's Lamassu machine. I personally know an owner of a Lamassu machine, so I can clarify some information, based on what he told me.
First, the newest software doesn't contain any private keys - just API key to control a server doing all the operations. In case of theft, the API key can be disabled, so the thieves have nothing.
Obviously, there's a bill acceptor with some cash inside. From information I got, there's some kind of protection that would spill some color on the bills if one attempted to open the acceptor forcibly (without the key).
So probably the only thing the thieves can do is to try to lockpick the acceptor.
TL;DR based on all information I have, the thieves really are idiots.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:26:16


There are no "private keys passing through". There's only API key in the machine supplied to it by QR code. That API key can be disabled when necessary. They could try to find bugs in the firmware but it's Open Source, if I remember correctly, so no point in stealing the machine.

How many people do you know who actually run them? Last time I said that `.bitcoin` directory takes only 181GiB with txindex enabled, people were laughing at "only". Sure, the storage cost is less than 10€, but nobody actually sees that. People see &gt;100GiB and they think it's too much.

A few months after I met my wife, she decided to buy bitcoins. The price at that time was about 200€ and her schoolmates were skeptical. She didn't buy much, but the relative gain is still nice.
2X hard fork will probably cause some fall in price but that may be good time to buy more. :)
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:27:47
As I've said, it _consumes a number `n` from stack and pushes the hash of `n`th block on the stack._
That means replay-protected transaction would contain this signing script (example given with recent block):
    OP_PUSH 493107 OP_PUSH_BLOCK_HASH OP_PUSH 000000000000000000a7a2dcb8e5c301969390de9670aadf2bf525c7123d0012 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_PUSH &lt;signature&gt; OP_PUSH &lt;pubKey&gt;
This transaction would be valid only on the chain which has block with hash`000000000000000000a7a2dcb8e5c301969390de9670aadf2bf525c7123d0012` at height 493107.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:31:55


I wouldn't call that an attack (unless they are actively attacking SPV users - that's all they can do anyway). It's more like them wasting money.


Miners can't let "market decide". They must decide to mine one chain or the other. Such situation is very risky for them because choosing the wrong side means loss.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:17:43
I wonder how one would sell such thing without being caught.
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:21:25
Yeah, somewhat more than 13-14 bitcoins every 10 minutes. Probably even more than that since miners could guess they risk POW change and also price of Bitcoin going down too much.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:17:15
The market disagrees.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:28:39
Another idea: together with friends make a transaction with &gt; 1MB base size. This is fool-proof for selling 2X coins, although not very convenient.
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:44:00
Well, I hope it will decentralize the market sooner than what other exchanges did before Gox fell.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:19:11
Maybe consider price averaging? (Buying regularly.)
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:00:52
It's absolutely not about feeling good and being altruistic. It's about validating the network for yourself, without trusting anyone else. It protects the owner from various kinds of attacks.
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:27:00
Who wants to risk so much to get that? AFAIK that machine doesn't store any fiscal information.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:46:08


Of course, it's 80% attack then! :)

Miners mining invalid blocks because of bugs in mining software, hard forks, intentional attacks (although quite unlikely). Wallet data providers lying. Also it protects privacy because it downloads all data, not just those related to one's transactions. Finally it provides independence from other services.

It's self-balancing system. Once there are too many savings and few people do business, the supply lowers, the prices rise, incentives to start business flip and people will invest again. No need to worry.

Oh, I don't meant they have to understand how it works on technical level. Just what gives it value. People understand that ability to cheaply send information over long distance gives value to network technologies. Many people buying Bitcoin don't understand that not relying on central institutions is what gives it value.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:19:35
No, because:
* the API key was disabled the moment the owner found out
* the can't open the acceptor without the key - if they do, some ink will be spilled on bills, invalidating them

Hardware wallet protect people from attackers taking their coins. Full nodes protect people from attackers sending them fake coins.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:16:44
The acceptor isn't some amateurish device but something normally used in the industry. They spent enough resources to protect that as well, don't you think?
To be more specific, according to my information, the acceptor would spill some ink on the bills if it's opened forcibly (without the key). They might attempt to lockpick it, but I don't think it'll be easy.
If the owner of the machine isn't crazy, there isn't much money inside (at most few thousands). I don't think it's worth the risk.

Hardware wallet is an electronic device specifically designed for handling private keys securely. Therefore it's significantly more secure than paper wallet. (Paper wallet needs to be generated and used on secure computer. Hardware wallet itself is a secure computer.)

This is what I was thinking about.


You mean that script versioning works only for verification script?


Why does it matter? What about relative time locks?


Well the point of it is to protect "original" Bitcoin users from replay &amp; reorg attacks, so they can dump their coins safely. This protection works even if the other chain reverts to OP_NOP. And if they do it, they cause the problem for themselves only.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:24:53
This is false. You get increased security and privacy.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:01:00
Well, there kind of is an incentive to mine old chain: 100 blocks spend limit on coinbase transactions. Miners can't spend coinbase until 100 blocks passed. So if you mine a block and now suddenly all the hash power is gone, you can't spend the coins you mined.
Making those 100 blocks e.g. 1000 blocks might help, but at the cost of making barrier of entry higher.
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:07:51

Everyone sane enough backed off way before that. Coinbase waiting for last minute shows they are incapable of detecting obviously bad ideas.


Ever heard of futures?


Coinbase is probably hurting adoption too, I guess even more. The first reason is the risk involved, so with some probability, many people will lose money and we'll see another shitstorm. The second reason is, most people store coins at Coinbase, not at their own keys. That means, they don't own actual bitcoins, but promises of bitcoins. This is no different from fiat.

@_date: 2017-11-29 20:51:38
Depends on amount of money. If you don't run a full node, someone could lie to you about your balance (seller of coins). If you buy from trusted seller, your risk is lower, but still above zero. Someone could compromise the seller or hard fork could happen. **Full** node protects against these.
The computer doesn't need to be offline - that's what Trezor is for.
I recommend you to search for tutorials to learn more. It's pretty simple though.
Some good ways to store your seed:
* write on paper and hide it somewhere
* use multiple papers and places if you can (just not too many, as you'd risk someone finding it)
* if you have a large amount consider cryptosteel or a similar project.
Do **not** ever under any circumstances write your seed into computer, smartphone, etc. The only time you should be doing it is when recovering - read the instructions before doing it, Trezor can do it safely.

Ah, OK. :)
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:08:51
Well, that doesn't change the probability of you guessing the right nonce.
That being said, tricking competitors to mine at loss gives the miner an advantage of higher purchasing power, so he can gain more % of hash power later (can outbid the competitors when buying ASICs). It also still causes difficulty to fall after 2016 blocks, so he will get higher profit then.

No fees is false: you pay by burning electricity. Faster processing is probably false too: one has to wait for confirmations too. Probably even more because of how cheap they are.

If he does so, Bitcoin will lose it's value because decentralisation is the source of it's value. People will then create a better, more robust system.

While I'm excited about this, I'd like to point out that it's not locked-in yet, so nothing is guaranteed! There has to be at least 6048 blocks mined for it to lock-in. As of writing this comment, it is just 4781. Theoretically, if enough blocks were mined without signalling, the lock in wouldn't happen.
It seems to be likely that it will activate but I'm not sure.

Of course. The key is showing the other genuine interest in their needs and in finding win-win situation to resolve the problem.
@_date: 2017-04-28 13:49:58
Use hard-fork to do it sounds like interesting idea (forget about dangers of hard for for now). My thinking is it'd be doable if both implementations were maintained for a long time with warnings when they disagree (preferring libbitcoinconsensus in decisions). Then one day, probably coupled with other hard fork (e.g. block size increase), switch those implementations.
@_date: 2017-04-28 13:59:26
It doesn't use libbitcoinconsensus, so you never know how many hidden consensus bugs are there.
On the other way it should be possible to change it to libbitcoinconsensus.
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:58:30
Thanks for explaining! If they invert the operation, one could use a block that is common to both chains.
@_date: 2017-04-28 13:33:36


That's nice, however, do we know for sure there isn't a memory safety bug? If someone wanted to search for them he would've to read all the code. In Rust, one needs to review just unsafe blocks.


Yeah, panics, consensus bugs etc. Rust strong type system might have prevented some but incompetent developers usually don't use type system. :)


I think that at this point Rust could survive on it's own. But that's just intuition.

My opinion is that he's mistaken. (But, it also might be that we are mistaken!)
@_date: 2017-04-12 13:24:20

There are really good tools for C and C++. I like sanitizers for example. It just seems that there are bugs despite the tools used or they weren't used.

Why should number of trips around Sun I do matter? Anyway, none of your guesses is accurate.


That's exactly what I wrote above. If you use `virtual` it's slow. If you don't, it isn't.


I've never seen single one of them, but I'd be interested in learning. Could you provide some examples?
Anyway, if your compiler has a problem with optimizations even when you don't use `virtual`, maybe you need a different compiler. It's not a fault of *the language*.
Now I stop defending C++ and I'm going to explain what's wrong with C++ in my opinion:
* auto-casting of integer types, even when they lose precision
* overloading
* default arguments
* standard error handling using exceptions instead of tagged unions AKA sum types AKA monads
* null pointers
* lack of traits/typeclasses (these should be added as "concepts" in C++17 I think)
* lack of build system that is simple to use
Thanks for the article! It aligns with what I know and believe in except I believe that possibly longer compile times are worth it.

Yes, this was my thinking too. The problem is it's not instant.
I was thinking that one could open a channel with someone while both funding it. The answer to possible attacks is: the other node could be unwilling to put there too much (e.g. more than what connecting node put there) and it could request a fee for this.
@_date: 2018-03-04 10:27:41
Sure, I was planning to think it through more and submit an issue, that's why I said "seem". Since you asked, here are my thoughts (think of them as drafts, please):
* Some traits take `&amp;self` and require `Sync + Send` Rustceans usually make traits take `&amp;mut self` and rely on the borrow checker to detect shared mutability. Then if someone wants to synchronize, he just puts the data type behind `Mutex`. It'd be even possible to provide blanket impl for Mutex. If some type is inherently thread safe, it can impl that trait for `&amp;T`. This is what e.g. `TcpStream` does with `Read` and `Write`. This design allows people to use traits and types in single-threaded environment without forcing them to use locks anyway.
* Futures + Tokio is becoming standard of async programming. Sure I know you wrote as few dependencies as possible. The question is where is the line? `std` is a dependency too. Futures and Tokio are maintained by the ~same people who maintain `std` and the language. But maybe there is another good reason not to use them?
* I've never seen a code that needed to use `Weak`, so something I'd like to think about is if it can be designed without it. I didn't research this yet, so I may end up concluding that current design is the best.
* Making separate crate for primitives like invoices, addresses etc, that are usable in different applications (e.g. payment gateways) might make a sense. Just like `http` crate contains primitives for working with HTTP.
I'll try to find some time and contribute. I have some other project now, but it should be close to finishing.

I understand what you are saying and I agree. The motivation to set up channel up front is the same why I setup my Internet connection up front: I don't lay Ethernet cable the moment I need to transfer a packet.

I didn't mean that it leads to deflationary currency. I meant that deflation slows down when economic growth slows down.
Example: a currency increases its value by 10% per year. People find out that no matter where they invest, they can't get 10% per year, so they just hodl. Since people stopped investing, those 10% becomes 5%. Now people might find opportunities which return 7% per year, so they stop hodling and begin to invest. This makes deflation bigger again.


Correct. I didn't intend to suggest otherwise.
Is it clear now?

I understand low-level programming better than most programmers I know. I can clearly understand what instructions the CPU will execute provided a piece of C or C++ code.
And I agree that they give you power and control. That's why they became popular.
What I'm saying is that humans are flawed. Even the best C(++) programmers screw up. There are many examples to that. C-lightning is just one of them.
I don't say the solution is to use Java or whatever high-level language is now popular. I say to use Rust, which gives you exactly as much control as C does, but helps you write correct code.

C runs faster and is smaller only if you don't understand how C++ produces the code and use inappropriate high-level techniques.

Well, to be close to safety of Rust, you'd probably need to use `shared_ptr` (no references) everywhere and not use threads. And I'm still not sure if that's enough.

Yeah, I think it mostly boils down to "gc languages don't cooperate with OS enough". Another example is when another application in the OS needs RAM, there's no way OS would trigger GC in GC application when there isn't enough RAM.
@_date: 2018-03-06 07:59:41
With huge effort and there are still bugs found in them. I advocate for using something that helps to write safe code with less effort.
@_date: 2018-03-06 07:53:52


This is not true. This code:
    class Foo {
        int add() {
            return a + b;
        }
        int a, b;
    }
Is compiled exactly same as this C code:
    struct Foo {
        int a;
        int b;
    }
    int foo(Foo *this) {
        return this-&gt;a + this-&gt;b;
    }
If you wouldn't write struct in C, you wouldn't write class in C++. If you do, than it's not problem with the language.
Edit: of course, if you use `virtual` (dynamic dispatch), then it will slow down. But same if you use function pointer in C. If you don't need it, you don't pay for it.
If you strongly believe that I'm bcash/big block shiller, then maybe look at my previous comments in r/Bitcoin. I run my own node, which has trouble with blockchain already, why would I want bigger blocks? CW is scammer.

The point isn't to optimize everything. The point is to have safe and correct code, which may need something special in certain performance-critical spots.


I've seen this in practice. I've seen code copying data three times from data structure to data structure, instead of just storing a pointer.
I've seen code like this:
    void set_foo(const string &amp;str) {
        foo = str.c_str();
    }
Being changed to copy because it was impossible to reason about lifetimes.
BTW, every time I see `strlen()` I realize the count could have been stored somewhere and not being re-computed every time. I've also recently fixed some code containing multiple `strlen()` called on same data. These things are littered all over a huge codebase because C strings were poorly designed from the beginning, so this became part of culture and coding style.

Core doesn't send transactions when not synchronized as it isn't sure if the outputs you are trying to spend are actually valid (e.g. some other instance could spend them).
This can be bypassed:
1. right click on the transaction and select copy id.
2. Open Help -&gt; Debug window
3. Select console tab
4. Type in "getrawtransaction " (without quotes) and paste the transaction Id
5. Delete "-&lt;some number&gt;" from the end of the transaction ID
6. Hit enter
7. Copy hex output
8. Google some transaction broadcasting service and paste in the raw transaction
9. Submit

Git does ensure that people have same data, provided you check hash of the HEAD.
You can download a blockchain and fuck up your local copy. Same thing. There's nothing that can magically make your disk fault-proof.

Not really. There were three classes of attacks against Trezor:
* the RF button bug
* supply chain attack
* extraction attack
The RF button is impractical and must be combined with other kind of attack. Supply chain can be executed against both. Ledger pretends to be protected against it, but due to their poor architecture, it's vulnerable anyway. Trezor doesn't offer direct protection, but you can create your own Trezor since it's Open Source. Extraction attack can be easily protected against using extra password.

I don't want to offend you, but from my experience I'd assume you are a novice. I was cocky about C too. I thought that C is great, you just need patience to write it. I found out no matter how hard I tried, there were memory bugs, which I had to chase for days. And I saw that other programmers, even the most experienced ones, have the same problem.
This is why I'm saying we need a better tool to help us spot the mistakes in our code. We have already such a tool without giving up any power C would give us. So why not use it?

1) honest marketing would have a link there explaining that it has low probability and that it did happen once. I've seen ads claiming something with asterisk and further down was clarification. The big difference is that nobody ever reversed transaction in BTC. ETH did it once. From another point of view, if I got into ETH believing that my contracts will be executed exactly as written, I'd view current ETH chain as invalid, so ETC would be real chain.
2) I was very excited to hear about more flexible smart contracts, but then realized I don't see real world use case for them. They are mainly useful if you can prove that you provided a service and atomically unlock money, but there are not many things that can be proven. I know of only a single case where this would be useful, but that specific case would be expensive even on top of ETH. I will change my mind if ETH will have AES256 or Chacha/Salsa optimized primitive(s).
3) there is no "hard developer work for crowdfunding". You just post your address and it's done. If you want kickstarter-like contract, there's an app for that: Lighthouse. If you want to issue tokens, you are better off with centralized implementation because people trust you with token value already.

One big problem with all that is that Ethereum people claim to provide "unstoppable contracts run exactly as written". It's on their website. This is outright fraud. If they wrote "almost unstoppable", I'd be fine with it.
Also nobody says that smart contracts have 0 value. Hell, LN is a smart contract! Even Satoshi built them into BTC.
The thing is I've never seen any ETH smart contract solve a real world problem that would be unsolvable in other ways.

3. Merchant/payment processor sees it's from tainted address
4. Merchant/processor acts as if the transaction didn't happen

I'm not denying it.

I don't know but I got the impression that everyone else got confused (including myself).


I counted only three well-known Core devs. Maybe that's because I don't know all of them...


Well, I agree I could express myself more clearly, I was in hurry. By "badly designed" I meant my four main pain points:
* unconditional activation without learning how SegWit affects the blockchain
* rushed hard fork
* lack of HF bit makes it more difficult to develop SPV wallet which tracks correct blockchain
* lack of replay protection


I know and I strongly believe it's very poor reason for doing so. The moment such fork activates, those clients will not become 2X clients nor Core clients. They become "most work chain" clients regardless rules. This is dangerous because one day a person might see their funds, another day they may see nothing.


That is not reason for rushed hard fork. I will not ride a car at 200km/h to recover lost time just because I had to wait 6 months to get my drivers license.

It's not "Do as we say or the network will be fractured" but "Do as we say or we won't buy your coins". Since forking the network was economically worse, miners did what users said. (The miner creating forking block would only have one group of users to sell the coins, while if he doesn't fork, he can sell it to anyone.)
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:38:44

Sure, the thing is that soft fork can scale Bitcoin as much as hard fork. It seems that the change of constant is simpler, but if that was the fact, 2x would be released already. Also LN can scale Bitcoin thousands times, block size increase only few times.
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:45:40

IDK, AFAIK just a good tax heaven.
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:58:33
Anyone can create as many addresses as he wishes. If this wasn't the case, Bitcoin would have enormous privacy issue (basically everyone seeing all past, present and future transactions and balance of anyone else).
Privacy-aware people split their amounts into multiple addresses to hide their balance. Most wallets try to do this by default too (but it's better when someone uses it consciously).
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:43:04
You can send a message to the Trezor asking it for randomness (I've successfully tried this a ~year ago), so you can analyse the randomness of your own Trezor or even use it as a hardware RNG. The downside is that it requires you to confirm it with physical press of button (this can be solved by flashing your own firmware).

What he posted is false, as other people already explained. I'm beginning to be scared of upvotes it received.
@_date: 2017-09-22 23:21:40
First both parties setup two "main" transactions: one on LTC network, another on BTC network. They prepare "backup" transactions - transactions returning original amount back in case of failure, then they commit to the "main" transactions and broadcast them to the respective networks. Finally, they finalize those two transactions in such a way that this operation requires disclosing a secret that unlocks the coins on the other chain.

@_date: 2017-10-31 07:58:51
The point is **we don't know** the relationship of people to addresses. It could mean that everyone has one address, it could mean that all people have same amount of bitcoins (some having it on one address, others having it on multiple and other having it together at single address - e.g. via exchange).

I think I wasn't clear. Are there cryptographic primitives that work just like existing ones (hashes, signatures...) while not being vulnerable to P=NP?
@_date: 2017-09-07 10:44:51
Since SegWit got activated you don't need Ethereum. Also, the OP was asking about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:15:42
Why would anyone invest, if not for belief in price rising? Why would anyone believe price will rise if not for chance of bitcoin becoming the standard?
Anyone who invests in anything either believes in it's success or is out of his mind. Therefore either bitcoin is both the currency of the future and reasonable investment vehicle or neither.

Very well!
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:30:23
You are welcome. I don't think exchanges have any reason to prefer only miners running fill nodes. One reason that comes to my mind is that they believe it's easier to change consensus rules when there are fewer nodes (which is probably true), so they would have higher power. The flip side is that Bitcoin would be weaker and that could harm profits in the long term.
I don't know if it's actually beneficial for exchanges to hold money of users,, but maybe they can do fractional reserves, see transaction history of the users and possibly some other things.
@_date: 2018-03-06 08:03:10
Yeah, I was wondering why, but it's also pretty understandable. They are probably under load while moderating and there are by big-blockers spreading misunderstandings. So they were rightly suspicious. I certainly didn't want to spread FUD. I'm actually hopeful that these issues get resolved.

I think you refer to the futures market. There are futures markets already that allow people to trade before the fork happens. (They must trust exchanges to do that.) Once it happens, the exchange will split the coins and send them to those participants.

@_date: 2017-10-30 09:47:09
That's not true. I believe most people have multiple addresses with small amounts that add up to large amounts. Addresses with large amounts may be minority because of few people ignoring privacy or using old wallets. As someone else mentioned, It's also because of exchanges and other services.
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:25:04
Maybe I misunderstood what you said. I thought that you mean bitcoins are distributed even less equally but maybe you meant the opposite?
@_date: 2017-09-26 06:37:05

A system that preserves the log of everything existed since 2005 and it's called git. Where were companies then? Nobody gave a shit about such thing before Bitcoin. And why call git a blockchain? That's completely confusing. Git is git and blockchain is blockchain.

AFAIK Trezor implements it.
@_date: 2017-10-20 10:40:28
It's for your protection. If you don't run full node, someone could sell you 2X coins (worth about 13% of Bitcoins) for price of Bitcoins and you couldn't tell the difference.

Thank you for expressing your concerns clearly and without personal attacks! It seems I didn't thought-out my communication very well. You seem like honest guy, so I believe you will be open to try to understand this better.
First, I want to explicitly and clearly express what was intent of my post:
* To inform people that LN is still experimental, so better not use it on mainnet.
* To inform people that work needs to be done, so they would knew contributing makes a huge sense
What I was afraid from the start was that people will falsely assume I'm BCH shill or whatever based on the fact that I posted something "negative" about LN. Hence the disclaimer. It seems that the disclaimer may have achieved the opposite effect, which I'm now sad about.
Next, I'd like to better describe this situation. I didn't write it completely accurately before, because I didn't want to make my post too long. So my thought processes didn't happen in span of few minutes/hours. I was looking at different implementations over long time. That one about lnd was a long time ago and I remembered that and it didn't occur to me that the situation could have changed over such long time. I admit, this was a mistake and I'll happily give it another try. Even though, it still has one interesting disadvantage over C-lightning: it requires -txindex, while C-lightning doesn't. I'll try to prepare the blockchain on a faster machine.
As I wrote somewhere else, I wanted to write this post much sooner. Unfortunately I didn't have enough time, so it happened by chance that Peter was thinking the same thing and tweeted about it before I posted. I was in no way influenced by him.
This also explains why I write about single language and didn't offer any other - just like Peter. The reason is I believe it to be the best tool for the job. I think that Go would be still better than C. (I'd actually prefer lnd over C-lightning, and had I not made a stupid mistake of not looking at lnd after while, I'd try that one first.)


Aaaah, this is a mistake in original post and I meant to write "so I wouldn't be able to receive my payment". I guess I had a bad day.
I'm not sure why you perceive that one about 5% fees a red flag. I'd be interested to know.
I'm not a native speaker so maybe the word "obsolete" doesn't mean the same thing, or our definitions of obsolete don't match. My definition is "there exists something that can do everything X can do and do it better". If I understand you correctly your definition is "not used anymore" or something similar. By your definition, C is not obsolete and I agree this is the case. By my definition C is obsoleted by Rust simply by the fact that you can do anything in `unsafe` Rust, just as in C, while having a tool to find your mistakes outside of `unsafe` blocks.


Well, I meant size-conservative if that's a more appropriate name. I don't think I've ever seen this phrase, but I'm not sure. It didn't occur to me someone would find it inappropriate.
That "Ouch" was admittedly a very inefficient response. In my view trying LN on mainnet even against recommendation to not do it from the developers is very similar to keeping coins on exchanges.
I'd love to prove you somehow that the crash logs aren't there, but it's impossible to prove, because I could have fake it if I wanted.
I believe I did my best to explain any misunderstandings that came from my post. I'm sorry if anything I wrote had negative impact on anyone. If anything is still unclear, feel free to ask.

You go into settings and set 1st passphrase (let's say "fake account"). Then send your "fake amount" to address belonging to it. Disconnect Trezor and reconnect. When asking your pass phrase, enter something else - this will be your "real account".

Computer/software. The term "full node" refers to running software which validates all the rules of the network and so is able to tell the difference between genuine Bitcoins and fake coins.

@_date: 2017-10-21 20:14:34
I just looked at my specs and it's 2.5G RAM (bitcoind is currently eating &lt;20%) but maybe it was higher during the sync.
BTW, I bought 2TB HDD, so I could be more future-proof, have txindex=1, run electrum server and maybe I'll use remaining space as NAS.

Thanks! BTW, I noticed you sometimes write very short responses without explanation, which may sometimes make it harder for people to hear what you're saying. I think your views are very valuable, so I'd be sad to see people rejecting them just because of that.
I understand that you are busy, so I'd suggest always provide just very short explanation. E.g. you saying that there were botnets already was enough for me to realise the truth in this case.

@_date: 2017-10-24 07:36:16


Yeah, unfortunately. I view that as a huge problem with Bitcoin.


Sometimes someone mines an invalid block and those who don't check whether the block is valid and start mine on top of it are wasting resources because their block will be considered invalid too.
One such event happened some time ago, when proponents of block size increase were running alternative full node, which had a bug causing mining of too large block. That block was wasted resources in the first place, but I guess, there were miners who tried to mine on top of it and all the time and electricity they spent was wasted.

Not saying that winter in Bratislava is pleasurable though. There's a strong, cold wind because of the lack of hills.

To all those of you complaining that 10 minutes is too much: micropayment channel is the solution. Unfortunately I'm not aware of any implementation.
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:26:22
There's no "out of sync" in case of different chains - they're unsyncable by definition.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:35:37
Ah, now it makes sense. In that case pruning won't help you at all. If you can't get better connection, you can try [Blockstream satellite](
Of course, one shouldn't trust the satellite alone, but the way to implement practical hybrid approach is to get transactions and block headers through satellite. And cross-check block headers from different independent sources (via P2P network, ideally including TOR). They take only 80B, so that's fine.
If there are missing transactions broadcasted over satellite, one could download them on-demand. I'm not sure if this mode is already implemented but I'm thinking about looking into this too. Maybe can clarify this.
I think there are other options like download-only mode, which doesn't relay transactions, just downloads the blocks (should be at most 2MB/10 minutes ~ 8.6GB/month).
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:09:17
Yes, 2X is effectively an alt. The problem is that it's so similar to the original Bitcoin that SPV wallets (those that don't download/verify everything - currently more widely-used than full nodes) can be easily fooled into accepting blocks from the other network.
SPV wallets could be specifically coded to distinguish those two chains but that's not easy because of the way 2X is implemented. (BCash did it much, much better.)
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:27:16
It's not volunteering. Full nodes provide higher security and privacy. That's the benefit you get for running it.
Miners should run full nodes, but unfortunately some don't. This will cost them a lot of money from time to time.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:52:26
If you have a larger stash of money, you should definitely buy a hardware wallet. Coinbase may get attacked or shut down (google "Mt. Gox") or they can sell you some other coins instead of bitcoins. (They actively support "hard fork" which will create another cryptocurrency, very similar to Bitcoin but highly probably with very low price.)
@_date: 2017-10-20 10:46:47
This statement is completely wrong. Spawning more nodes is trivial. If it wasn't, we wouldn't need mining.

I think the best way to say it is "software implements protocol". Saying software "uses" protocol is not bad though.
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:41:21
If someone flooded one of the chains so your transaction wouldn't process quickly enough, you'd lose money. That's of course very unlikely.

@_date: 2017-09-19 21:33:09
Did you read their FAQ? Their firmware is Open Source and built deterministically, so you can verify it. They analysed PRNG and it's very high quality. (Stick told me that in person.) Even if it was biased, it adds additional randomness from computer.
You either secure some secret information or you have a third party. There's no way around it. The main reason Bitcoin exists is to not need the third party. If you want third party, traditional system is probably much better.


There was never a single theft from HW wallet that I know of. There were so many exchanges attacked that I stopped counting.


Then most risks are irrelevant.


It depends on the quality of the exchange and magnitude of attack. If attacker steals too many coins, the exchange may be unable to refund it.
BTW, stealing from third party isn't the only risk. Another one is risk of funds being frozen by the third party (most probably because the government threatens the exchange with violence). This risk doesn't exist when you have private keys.

pointed out it's conservative recommendation - I believe he is correct. If you want to know more exact number based entirely on your use case, fully sync your node, shut it down for 24 hours and then measure time it takes to catch up. (Repeat few times for more reliable results.)
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:59:06

@_date: 2017-10-21 20:03:39
USB? I suppose you mean "USB flash drive", because "USB" doesn't make sense. :)
In that case, for any hardware wallet to be secure, it must have two important elements: a screen and a physical input device (button or touch screen).
Reason: if it didn't have screen, a malware could show you different transaction details than those sent to HW wallet. So you would think you are paying Alice 0.1 BTC but in reality, you'd create a transaction sending all you savings to attacker's address. In case of Trezor, you can verify the recipient and amount on the screen.
If it didn't have physical buttons, it'd be much easier for malware to brute-force PIN.

Yes, right now they aren't useful because there's no wallet support (but network can handle it).
Basically you could send coins to locked output in advance. Output can be unlocked when both you and Gyft agree on it or when it times out.
In practice you would send e.g. 100 mBTC to locked output with timeout 1 month and then, when you want to buy something for 10 mBTC using Gyft, you just create transaction spending from that output to Gyft address. Gyft wouldn't broadcast it yet. If you want to buy something else for 20 mBTC in the future, you would create spending transaction with same input as previous but with 10+20 == 30 mBTC. When end of month approaches (or Gyft decides to spend coins), Gyft broadcasts last transaction and the network accepts it. If Gyft disappears and isn't able to return your coins, you can take them after one month without interaction with Gyft.
Now I saw one problem: Gyft can't instantly convert to fiat. Maybe when volatility decreases, it will be better.

Then I bought 0.5 BTC for 4€, spent it soon.

Suppose they do know what Trezor is and how it looks like, you memorize the seed (or write it on your underwear :D), leave the Trezor in that Orwellian country and buy new one and restore from seed in the other country.
But most probably they don't have any idea what Trezor is and that gives you ability to say "device for 2 factor authentication". (You really can use it as 2FA device on some websites!) Still, you most probably want to wipe it and then restore it, just to be sure.

Assuming what you say is correct and no node except miners verifies the rules then in theory, if miners cooperated and changed the rules, nobody else would notice. And since nobody would know why wouldn't they do it? It's pure profit!
The fact is that what you claim is incorrect. I've read the actual code. The [code says]( to reject any block that doesn't pass the [`CheckBlock()`]( function and that function checks the rules.

One Subway in Bratislava accepted Bitcoin for a while, then they stopped. I felt kind of sad about it but I hoped they will start again. Nothing happened.

Actually, if you read the whitepaper, you will find out that Satoshi worked exactly as Jobs described: he started with needs: currency that can't be inflated, censored and seized by central entities. Then he worked back to solve the problem using cryptography.
GUI wan't concern for him, because he was actually solving **his** problem of not having such currency. He didn't value GUI as much as other people do because he had no problem using any GUI. (Even CLI I guess).
If we want to fulfill needs of more people than Satoshi, we need to work on GUI too.

I'd say guaranteed income (from taxes) gives them power. They have nothing to lose by doing bad things.
I'd expect anarchy to function better because of incentives. Just like bitcoin (which **is** anarchy), where it's more profitable for miners to provide service than screw with people, I believe that it's more profitable for businesses to provide service - otherwise people will not buy from them. (If a miner mines invalid block, people won't buy his block reward.)
In political system, if politician provides bad service, people won't stop paying taxes, because they don't want to go to prison.

Reasons to use Trezor:
* Trezor is 100% Open Source and therefore reviewable.
* Devs put much, much work into security. It's hard to even express how secure it is. They most probably thought of every possible threat and invented some way to prevent it.
* Devs are well-known within community and created other interesting projects (e.g. Slush poll - the first pool ever created, coinmap.or - first Bitcoin map...) They are clearly in the field not just to get rich (quickly) but they obviously value Bitcoin, security and privacy.
* I've never heard of anyone losing their coins on Trezor.
* AFAIK Trezor was reviewed by several security experts, including Andreas Antonopoulos.
* Trezor has also **very** secure password storage, SSH, GPG and Trezor login support.
* They are also very friendly and keen to help anyone
* If you find a backdoor there, you can write me PM and I'll go and beat them :D (Just kidding.)

I think you've lost context. I was saying that "not everything banks do is secure" and gave example of online payments. My point was that if you rely on what banks do, you might actually end up with something insecure.

There is a way to do soft-fork increase of block size. It's somewhat combination of side chains and current implementation of SegWit.
When I proposed it some time ago, most replies were "It's too complicated." Yet they are doing very complicated thing with SegWit already.

I like Austrian economy too. Supply and demand are OK. The problem with Bitcoin is that even if there is higher fee, it doesn't attract competitors to process more transactions because it's hard limit. Everyone has to verify.

If you want real security (most probably, if you have many bitcoins), definitely buy Trezor hardware wallet. It's the most secure device on Earth to protect your Bitcoins.

There are no (known) vulnerabilities in 0.12.1. If there were, people would be screaming on reddit already. In that case I would accept such decision without problem.


I think I wasn't clear. He might've left the package as is and only release upgrade for other versions. I mean, if I did `apt-get upgrade` nothing would happen to the package. Doing nothing is enough to achieve that result.


No, I meant something like this:
    
    zenity --warning --title="Unsupported version of Ubuntu" --text="We can no longer support this version of your system. If you want newest version of Bitcoin Core, you have to upgrade. The old (0.12.1) version will be launched now."

It should be possible because LN needs just UTXO to function. UTXO is never pruned. So as far as someone doesn't do some crazy implementation which explicitly forbids you that, you'll be able do it.

@_date: 2016-10-13 22:35:28
What references you need? It's hard to guess, maybe [this]( Or maybe the fact that each time you use your card, you have to copy secret information into doubtfully secret systems (visru, ehm, I mean Windows, browser, some weird site and their hosting...)? Or maybe it wasn't clear from my reply that I was reffering to the last two paragraphs of your text?
@_date: 2016-10-13 22:26:09
OK, so in point 1 they are equal. 2) is just another part of 1). 3) not explained how fault injection would work against Trezor and not against secure element. 4) sounds OK (no reference but whatever) but doesn't show any superiority of SE. 5) "making sure that your device has not been tampered with during production" the only way to be sure is to make everything from scratch yourself. Anything else is just relying on other factors (mostly people). Also, without details. "6" (not numbered there) appeal to authority and not just that. It's appeal to authority with very bad reputation in this field.
* States failed at security horribly several times. My favorite is national bureau of security in Slovakia having password nbusr123 (it's like if NSA had nsaus123)
* Banks still use systems that lack electronic signature. If you are making online payment you have to enter all private information. Similar thing happens with payment cards.
* Identity industry - the only identity industry I know lives from existence of state. (See the one above.)
* PayTV industry - this seems valid, but maybe they weren't compromised because nobody is bothering pirating some boring TV channels? (Compare it to stealing thousands of Bitcoins.) Or maybe because there are more simple ways to do it.
* I know several Open Source projects that are actually quite crappy (e.g. Arduino). Being Open Source is not guarantee of quality (also being closed isn't)
But in the end, I think reasoning of SatoshiLabs is quite anarchistic. They want as few authorities to trust as possible. Using general-purpose MCU is no guarantee but it's less likely that somebody invented backdoor for it, because nobody knew it would become so useful in the future. Anarchism is nature of Bitcoin, so I see it as very important.

Say I want to buy X for Y bitcoins. I send the seller Y bitcoins and wait until he gives me X. Then I double spend, so that seller must burn those Y bitcoins. There's no difference for me and I can proceed to sell X for Y bitcoins to someone else (and be careful about confirmations), while the seller basically lost Y bitcoins. Repeat this enough times and the seller is bankrupt. (Any competitor of the seller would be interested in doing so.)

@_date: 2016-10-13 21:57:53
Well, banking industry also has card payment systems, which send private "keys" in the clear. I think that's enough argument against your appeal to authority...
@_date: 2016-10-15 23:09:10
AFAIK that doesn't change with SE. If I order two devices, one of them is TREZOR and other is Ledger (or whatever) and anyone sent me fakes, I will never find out. (Unless someone invents cheap device that can inspect chips without destroying them and it's itself proven to not be backdoored.)
So from that point of view, the best thing I can do is to take random MCU, solder it on my own PCB and then flash there (reviewed) firmware. I find likelihood of someone knowing about it and targeting that specific MCU quite low.
Something that was specifically created for security applications may be more attractive for attackers...
@_date: 2016-10-15 22:55:27
I believe that attention is drawn not by what's more secure but by what's more profitable. If Breadwallet becomes widely used for storing large amounts of Bitcoin, then iPhone attacks will spread too.
But there are new interesting ways to prevent bugs in code. Take for example Rust programming language. It guarantees you that your code won't have certain types of bugs (if you do the simple basics right). It's certainly much less expensive to re-program Trezor in rust than re-program whole iOS with it's drivers and then also Breadwalled in Rust. (I guess it won't happen in next ten years.)

I disagree. They had an explicit statement on their website that in case of doubt, the machine code of contract defines what should happen. The machine code said the money belong to someone who sends recursive TX and anyone who's says otherwise is attacker. Anyone who's put money into such thing without reading the code was fooled.
By forking they committed fraud.
If you sign a contract that says all your money belong to me, it should be valid no matter if you say that you did it by mistake or not.
If this is not true, how you're gonna distinguish if someone put the bug there on purpose from genuine mistake?
The people who still use ETH (as opposed to ETC) prove only one thing: they didn't understood the point of the blockchain.

I'll be glad to explain. I understand precisely that LTS means just core Ubuntu. I understand and accept that third party refuses to make upgrade for older version. What I have problem with is not that he didn't make upgrade. He actually did fake upgrade which **removed** the binaries completely, so the application became unusable (non-existent).
This is clearly worse than doing nothing. If he did nothing, users would be still able to use older version, which is still perfectly usable and secure on a system which is still maintained, usable and secure. There was no need to make deleting package.
If he really wanted to very obviously warn users he could've added short (three lines) script in place of bitcoin-qt binary which would show some alert window and then launch the thing from other locations.
Is this more understood now?

If you mean as in privacy (not reusing same address), then it depends on wallet you are using, but most probably yes. If you mean that it is cryptographically unprovable that other address belongs to you, even if someone has seed, then there are two ways of solving it: you can use two seeds, or you can use seed+two passwords (supported by Trezor wallet)
If someone breaks one private key, then the security of other keys depends on derivation method (hardened is secure in this regard).
Does this answer your question?

That's not the point. If one uses old but still secure software it's OK. He could've left the package unupgraded and it would still work quite well.
The problem is that he instead created a package which appears as upgrade but actually **removes** the old version. So after upgrade you find out you can't access your money (until you upgrade).
If he wanted to provide some kind of warning, he should've created a new package which would launch zenith dialog before running. Putting not in change log wasn't obvious enough (upgrades are automatic).

Depends on what you mean by "the network" and "immediately". There's no sort of automation for this. But if people really wanted, they could hard-fork mining algorithm making all the investment in miners useless.
If I was a legit miner and some gov would want to buy miner from me and I knew what the gov is planning, then I would sell all my miners to gov, sponsored devs to change mining algorithm and then I would invest in developing devices mining new algo. Profit. :)

Satoshi is the paying customer. He wanted it for himself. He paid for it with his time. It's more of coincidence, that other people have such needs.
The only way he could stay anonymous and still allow us to trust the system was to make it open. It's impossible to create closed trustless system. That's why he made it open.
So when other people find it valuable, why would we want them to not use Bitcoin? I don't get it. Make it user-friendly and it will be easier for them.

The problem is, there's no way to know whether that commitment is valid until pubkey is revealed, thus it's unknown whether the fee is valid too.
One way to address this is to require the fee to be paid by QC proof signature, but that creates a chicken-egg problem.

The security of VM is only as high as security of hosting system. That means if you run Linux VM inside e.g. Windows XP you are screwed. If I couldn't afford buying Trezor, I'd probably buy Raspberry Pi and some cheap $15 display and keyboard. Of course, I'd never go online with that Pi.
Backups are necessary always.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:01:51
I'll explain it in simple terms. Imagine you used incorrect Bitcoin script and someone found out about it. He would take your coins and send them to a BTC-&gt;Monero exchange. He would exchange them for Monero immediately. When you'd look at your balance you'd find out that the coins are lost. If people forked the chain the Monero exchange would lose the money because history was rewritten.
Same with Ethereum. If he managed to sell it **before** fork then after fork the exchange wouldn't have coins.
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:51:11
I can't tell you what's the best investment but if you don't want to risk buying BIP148 coins, you probably should stay in other currency, or simply stop transacting until the fork resolves.
And yes, it's because it's a SF.

I'm not sure if that would be aligned with incentives well. The sender of a TX usually doesn't care about validating it. But the receiver is. The receiver has incentive to validate and bigger blocks increase his costs of validation.
Of course, this proposal coupled with extending payment protocol to allow receiver to ask for specific signalling would allow him to propose smaller blocks. Basically, the receiver could *indirectly* pay for smaller blocks.

If you bought from the guy who exploited the DAO, then you don't have that ETH. If you didn't, then you're OK.

You can have as many wallets as you want and therefore you can hide how much you own. You can appear like you have only few satoshis and the attacker would't know.
There is already support for this in TREZOR walled. If you enter different passphrase, different wallet is unlocked and as long as your pass phrases are secure, it's unprovable that you know some other pass phrases.

If the amount is just for playing with Bitcoin, sure but in that case there must be a warning: "Don't do it for large volumes!"

@_date: 2016-05-27 10:35:44
OK, so the security relies on power users paranoid enough to perform such test. Unfortunately, from my experience, most users are not paranoid power users, so while some attacks will be detected, others won't be. Also negative result of test is not proof of absence of MITM (Clever attacker could somehow know you are testing and pause the attack. Although, this is much harder.)
I mean, the feature is certainly useful but I wouldn't give it so much applause as most redditors do. (My subjective opinion.)

What kind of idiot is he to do such thing? I have old system, so what? The old version was still perfectly usable. Just don't release upgrade, make it fail, or whatever but this kind of change is very drastic.
Not just that I almost shitted myself when I found that the binaries are missing.  I spent one hour of figuring out how to securely install old version, I'm now long time behind (because I didn't notice that the client didn't start) and I'm hungry because I wanted to order food with Bitcoin...

He also shared one thing he does: whenever he has an idea, e.g. an analogy, he writes it down. (I think he mentioned this happens mostly in the morning, but I'm not sure if I remember correctly.)

If the answer is "no" you need to warn the newbie before he loses huge amount.
When my, at that time, girlfriend asked me that she wants to save in Bitcoin I was excited as hell but I decided to explain her that it's very dangerous.

Based on facts.


I've heard this argument before and I don't see anything different. Reorganizing the layout of blocks can't lead to vulnerabilities: it's same data, just moved around. In other words, if this attack is possible after SegWit, it was certainly possible before SegWit.


This was debunked already. When LN nodes are upgraded these days, they require closing all channels, which means appearing to be down. And even if it's true, nobody ever claimed LN is done. It's beta. I'd love to see you code some software and being it perfect at the first attempt.


No, I don't, since I run my own full node.


Decentralization isn't some ultimate goal. Trustlessness is the goal. I don't care if something is centralized if that center is physically incapable of screwing me. In LN, no node is capable of screwing someone else and that's enough. That being said, [I don't see any center here](


Because I've actually read and understood that bloody smart contract which powers it! It's the same reason I trust Bitcoin itself.

By breaching the server itself, which happened multiple times in history (from MtGox to Bitfinex...) This can be mitigated if the service uses multisig and requires your key but most services don't do it.


Of course, that's reasonable.

The main difference in the case of overflow bug is the fact that Bitcoin with that bug had literally zero value. It was such a horrible bug that rendered all coins useless. The fix was practically same as starting a new coin. Also this affected all users of Bitcoin without single exception (even the attacker had useless money at that point).
ETH bailout saved one group of people at expense of those who signed up for immutability. It's breaking the promise Ethereum made at the beginning. The "unstoppable" slogan and other things on Ethereum page are pathetic lies. They could be at least honest and put "unless community disagrees" disclaimer
I don't care about RSK, ETH or ETC until I have some useful application for it. (Well, I have one but none of them implements AES256...)
BTW, I'm considering creating some cool "DAPP" with intentional bug hidden there. Once it would gain adoption, I'd exploit that bug and then cause hard fork because "hey, community!". I could make ton of money...

The majority would have to have at least twice the hash power of minority (SegWit doubles capacity).


Why do you think so many nodes upgraded to SegWit? Because they don't want SegWit?
Nodes that don't validate fully (SPV) don't matter because they don't verify rules.


Depends on the length of the fork.


We have two possible scenarios after 1 August:
1. The fork didn't happen yet
2. The fork did happen
In case of  the rational miner may think like this: if he mines SegWit-compatible block, he won't cause the fork and all the coins he mines are pre-fork coins, so he's able to sell them on both chains (if fork occurs later). Signalling SegWit isn't much costly, so it's easier to simply signal and not risk lower value of the coins.
In case of  it's more profitable to mine more valuable chain. It's difficult to determine which will be more valuable.


They serve as bill validators. Only fully validating nodes can distinguish valid coins from counterfeit. If someone's paying you with counterfeit bill and you don't know it, you'll accept it and then be surprised once someone rejects it as invalid. How long do you think a currency would survive if nobody validated the bills?

Because if you are hosting it on VPS, the people running host machine could:
1. fake transactions (so you'd think they paid you)
2. be coerced or bribed to fake transactions
3. spy on your lookups to learn which (and how many) bitcoins you own
4. report to the government
However, if you own and physically host bigger server with multiple virtual machines, you could run full node on such thing.

No, that's not my point. If we wanted to deploy hard fork, some people would have to work a lot on it being coded and tested. If those people work on features like Shnorr and MAST it'd be better use of their time I think.
Also, maybe it'd be safer to not limit development time to 6 months. The flag day should be decided only after the code is prepared.
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:57:08


I thought you were talking about TX speed, no?


Those who don't obviously don't care. (Maybe because they don't understand the importance of running it.) I care enough about the Blockchain validity to have two nodes. Those who don't care are irrelevant.


Not in case of BIP148 **right after flag date**. The moment BIP148 enforcement begins any miner can choose to either create SegWit-valid block or invalid block. If he creates valid block, chain doesn't fork at that time. (It might later.) If he creates invalid, the chain forks and from that moment the coins will be invalid on the other chain.


ASICboost? Fear of loss of fees? Carelessness?


BIP148 makes any block not signalling invalid. They can setup border nodes and make a simple patch in getblocktemplate.


If there is a risk of chain split, they are. Just look at ETH/ETC hard fork. If the miner mines non-forking block, he can be sure that the block will be accepted in either case. If he creates forking block, he must be confident that BIP148 will fail.


Under BIP148 SegWit chain will never be orphaned (rewritten) by non-SegWit chain.


It's the opposite. Nodes fully validating the chain give incentive to nodes being honest.


Technically - yes, economically - probably not. Those 90% would become vulnerable to dishonest miners.


If the nodes are validating stricter rules, the non-upgraded nodes would see them as a part of network.
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:06:39

As if recent event in India related to fiat currency weren't terror...
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:25:25


OK. By TX speed I meant actually throughput (tps)...


From the original blockchain, yes, from SegWit blockchain never. Just as my node (and all nodes) will never-ever accept chain that mines more coins as it should, no matter how long it is.
ETH/ETC can coexist precisely because one rejects the other. If this weren't the case one would replace the other.


No. If you decided to e.g. reject all blocks that contain "42" in their coinbase, that would be similar to what BIP148 is now. If others decided to join you, the old chain would be wiped out. Else you'd be alone.
To put it in other words, the difference is that in hard fork, if one chain is 20% and the other is 80% there are two chains. If miners from more popular switch and there would be 80% for first, 20% second, both chains would still be here. However, with soft fork, if BIP148 chain is 20% and legacy chain is 80%, there are two chains. If miners switch, the old chain will be wiped-out.


**You** are the node. Miners care if they can sell you the coins or not (more profit for them if they can). If thousand people joined you then miners have 1000 more customers. There must exist a threshold where it makes difference.

That is my point. Sure, if you want less-costly device, probably the best way is this:
* buy RPi Zero
* buy SD card
* flash image
* verify image (SHA256/signature) from independent sources
* buy a keyboard if you already don't have one, buy a monitor if you don't have one
* plug-in the Pi and generate new private key, or better, a seed
* backup the seed
* maybe destroy the SD card?
To pay:
* createrawtransaction
* dump the transaction in hex
* type the hex into Pi (don't transfer via USB sticks - they could contain exploits)
* sign the transaction and get the hex
* type the hex into computer
If you have a job, you would probably earn more than what you saved during the time you would do all this steps.
Taking into account prices of Pi, SD card, (power source; though you probably already own one), keyboard monitor and much bigger convenience of HW wallets, I see HW wallets as better option.

Yes, you were lucky enough that those forked coins weren't yours. But imagine if the person who exploited the DAO contract sold you the coins from that contract. After rewrite of history, you would have nothing.
Maybe the history will repeat, maybe not. What's known is that ETC people refused to rewrite history, probably because they understand the issue and therefore will be more reluctant to rewrite history than people in ETH.

The DAO bug is not fixed in Classic specifically because such thing would invalidate immutability of the chain. This is something ETH people (those who forked) didn't consider and probably don't understand.
Think about this attack:
1. An attacker creates a contract with hidden, intentional bug or discovers the bug in existing contract
2. The attacker shorts ETH (that means he borrows ETH, sells it for some other currency in hopes he'll be able to return cheaper ETH later)
3. The attacker exploits the bug and immediately sends the coins to exchange
4. The attacker exchanges the coins for Monero (assuming it will take some time for people to realize what's happened and try to hard-fork)
5. The attacker waits for price to drop, then buys another Ether and returns it (finishing shorting). Now the attacker has all the money from the attack + money made by shorting.
6. People react and decide to hard fork. The exchange protests.
7. Hard fork rewinds history making the exchange lose the Ether and very probably bankrupt (if the amount is big enough)
8. The innocent exchange is hurt while those who are responsible for creating incorrect contract and those who blindly signed it without reading will be bailed-out
The DAO hard fork sets dangerous precedent and therefore it's very risky to operate an exchange. Possible solutions for the exchange:
* Insurance - this increases the costs and makes the service expensive
* Reject coins from non-standard/non-reviewed contracts. This makes Ethereum worthless
* The attacker is smart enough to do it (in case of DAO, nobody complained that he received coins from the attacker, so it seems like the attacker wasn't quick enough to exchange the coins or he wasn't smart enough)
* The attacker operates behind TOR.
* Monero won't hard fork soon enough or won't hard fork at all.

I wrote my first sentence in hurry. One important thing it's missing is that the guy tried it with Litecoin. And I meant "tried to test it", not "tried to send".
I'm certainly not against UASF. I might fear that specific implementations don't have enough support but I'm not against it.
Economic majority is weighted sum of all nodes (some nodes have higher weight). While technically only full nodes validate the Blockchain, SPV nodes can influence the full nodes too (e.g. a community of people using same trusted full node).
What's more important is that if full nodes reject blocks without SegWit then non-SegWit miners mine worthless coins and losing money.
It's the same principle as when full nodes reject blocks with subsidy higher than 12.5 BTC. If anyone mined block with higher subsidy, the block would be useless. (Similar thing was observed when BU mined slightly bigger block.)
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:10:28
If what you mean is so-called "day trading" then sure, what I described doesn't work. This can be changed by LN - it would allow keeping money off-exchanges while still being able to do day trading.

Bingo! There are no warnings. So why would you think that various block explorers will warn you? The most likely scenario is that nobody would notice.


I've never advocated running them in the background. I use my full node to verify whether I received valid bitcoins. I don't know what majority does (nobody knows).


If you want to trust others to validate transactions for you, fine, it's your choice to be less secure. Just stop advising other people making same choices. I'm fine with neutrally explaining why you decided as you decided.
Finally, there's another thing to think about: Bitcoin is anti-government technology and for it to make sense, it must withstand *all* government attacks - including the attempt of government to DoS it. (It's not rational for private miners to destroy bitcoin, but it is rational for government assuming bitcoin is a threat to them.) If people stop running full nodes, then there's a simple way government can DoS bitcoin: they create invalid blocks to cause confusion, so all SPV users can't use it safely anymore (or must wait ridiculous amount of confirmations). However, if one runs a full node, he can safely use Bitcoin even in such doomsday scenarios.

You should definitely make a will and put information about you giving Bitcoins in there. If you don't, your inheritors may fight over it.
When Segwit will be activated, there are better ways to make on-chain inheriting.

Depends on the amount. If you are technically capable, you can secure your coins with anything.
Consider this: AFAIK one of the authors of the Trezor had his coins stolen (before Trezor existed) and he certainly isn't technically illiterate. I don't know the details of the theft, so maybe he could clarify it.
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:33:02
If you want custodial-focused service because you don't want to manage the coins on your own, Bitcoin is not for you and you should stay in traditional banks. Bitcoin was invented for people who want to take control of their own money.

Go and find how many nodes upgraded. (And before you rant about Sybil attacks, think about how difficult would it be to spoof existing nodes **upgrading**.)


I've never claimed anything like that. I only claim that fully-validating receivers of Bitcoins are most important because they determine which blocks are valid and which are not.


They will find out once they'll see that "other chain" has faster, cheaper, more secure and more private transactions.


Difficulty adjustment will help combined with LN and with the fact that SegWit chain won't have to process TXes from legacy nodes.


They want to sell mined coins. It's more profitable for them to send coins for more money. If they mine SegWit-valid block, it will be accepted by all nodes and thus have higher chance to sell the coins.

@_date: 2016-05-24 10:22:58
Actually, when you send the Bitcoin transaction, it's **sent** instantly (let's say under a second). What really matters is **receiving** transaction.
What people consider received transaction might be different for different people. Here are some possible options:
* The receiver knows it can not be revoked
* The receiver can send the money to someone else and the other receiver will receive them
* The receiver trusts the sender not to double-emend or defraud him
* The receiver is somehow guaranteed to be able to spend the money later
(Some points may be similar or depend on each other)
So first let's examine how credit card payments work. When you send the payment, receiver is trusts the system to check for double spending and that he will be able to spend the money later. He knows immediately that with some probability (sometimes frauds and charge-backs happen) he will be able to spend the money in few days/weeks. This may be enough for many receivers to provide the product or service.
In case of bitcoin, some receivers trust the senders not to double spend and provide the product/service immediately (especially for low volume transactions double-spending might not be worth the effort). Some receivers do not trust senders and therefore wait for enough confirmations an then they provide product. In either case, the receivers may spend the coins within hour even if they are sending to not trusting receivers.
So, for receivers, bitcoin is clearly faster than traditional payments. But bitcoin will soon have another one unique feature: (thanks to lightning network) it will be instantly possible to tell that the sender is not double-spending. Because of this, bitcoin payments will soon be faster than anything else in the world, probably including cash (you don't have to count manually :)).
Conclusion: bitcoin is already faster than traditional payment systems and will be even faster. What you experience as "slow" is actually receiver-imposed delay because the receiver doesn't trust you.

I don't expect fork of small amount of money to be popular.
I think that the fact the devs had coins there combined with fear of governments influenced the hard fork. So watch out the next time Buterin will invest in some complicated contract...
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:29:23
There was an incident that someone could take money from poorly written contract. Instead of letting those who wrote the contract and invested in it suffer from mistake, the users of ETH did a hard fork which returned that money back. Sounds great right?
Well actually, if the money were transferred to someone else, who provided product/service for the money, he lost the money despite being completely innocent.
Since nobody claimed this it's probably fine right but how do we know they won't repeat the fork in the future?
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:51:25
The analogy isn't exact enough:
* There's no way to backup safe - if the attacker steals whole safe you're screwed
* There's no way to transfer money out of safe that was stolen while the attacker is trying to break in
* There's no way you could give an attacker false access to the safe
* It's much easier to transport Trezor or any hardware wallet

That's not the problem. The problem is days destroyed doesn't have any value for miners. In case of voting just by fees it's clearly better for miner to signal X and accept transactions with more fees than signal Y and accept transactions with less fees. But what makes miner to signal X and mine TXs with slightly less fees but better `fees * days destroyed` than mining Y with slightly higher fees but lower `fees * days destroyed`?

@_date: 2017-05-13 19:59:41
To be clear, I'm not trying to make everyone use it or advocating using it. I'd gladly accept anything that disables it. I'm just pointing out that it doesn't decrease security in principle.
If you claim that network is less secure due to it, you should describe exact scenario under which an attacker has it easier to attack the network with AB compared to without AB.
Currently the only scenario I know of is that the attacker has access to AB and honest nodes don't. (Interestingly, under this definition, Bitmain is an attacker. :)) However if everyone used AB attacker wouldn't have any advantage over other miners.
The network is designed to automatically adjust difficulty when it changes. Thanks to it the scenario would be the same as when people started to create ASICs. Yes, they had an advantage for a while but this stopped once others were using it too and the difficulty adjusted.
After difficulty adjustment miners would do about the same amount of operations as before AB.
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:48:12
Some guy tried to send million dollars to that "anyone can spend" address. Nobody even tried to steal it.
If majority of miners enforce SegWit, then it is safe. If majority of economy rejects SegWit-invalid blocks, miners will have to adapt. (Guess why today not even majority of miners can mine million coins in one block?)
If this is done via BIP148 and majority of economy will reject blocks that are not signaling SegWit, then other nodes will consider SegWit activated and begin enforcing the rules too.
If many nodes are enforcing the rules, it'd be expensive to even try to attack, so no sane miner will do it in the first place.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:08:29
SegWit will solve several problems, the most important is fix of malleability which prevents people from using payment channels. Using payment channels bitcoin can achieve thousands transactions per second that will be cheap, fast (no more waiting 10 minutes in many cases), more private and won't overload the Blockchain.

Why should I see it as a problem? Pure capitalism means anarchism (anarchy means "no rulers" when translated literally).
Let's suppose there is a bunch of rich people trading Bitcoin perfectly - that means they buy at lowest and sell at highest. What would that mean in practice? Two things. Firstly, their actions would affect price so it would fluctuate **less**. (Increased demand causes increased price and vice versa-) Secondly, they buy and store "excess" bitcoins which people don't need and provide something else, which people want more (e.g. USD, EUR, gold...) and conversely, they release/sell Bitcoins when people need them (so they are willing to pay more for them).
If someone is not trading perfectly (not exact lowest/highest), it's not a problem, because he still provides some value. If someone is trading wrong (buying high, selling low), he loses and will be sooner or later discouraged from doing that.
My conclusion is that I have no problem with those people who are risking their money to provide such value.

I don't claim to know everything, but I think the most plausible explanation is that they want to squeeze all possible benefits of Asicboost. That's also why they removed SegWit from their hard fork. It's probably the only way they can retain mining advantage.
In this scenario, the only miners who may want to mine BMC are those, who can use Asicboost. If it's true that Bitmain can control who may use it and who may not, then Bitmain becomes a central authority of BMC - something Bitcoin was designed to prevent.
Also, bigger blocks may lead to greater centralization even in case of AB not being used. (Mainly because of latency.) That puts BMC at great disadvantage, combined with the fact that it scales only few times (compared to BTC with LN, that can scale hundreds times).

What you wrote doesn't seem accurate to me. What do you even mean by "receive in block"? Full nodes receives whole blocks but block is not valid just because it exists. It must have valid PoW but also all other rules (e.g. no double spends, valid signatures...).


If a wallet asks for specific transactions it reveals which transactions it's interested in. Can you explain how it'd be possible to avoid receiving all transactions in order to prevent sniffing nodes from learning about private data?


Of course it does! If it didn't, Bitcoin would be doomed! It accepts only blocks which comply to specific set of rules and ignores others (malicious, accidentally bad and hardforks).
SPVs can't easily choose the chain because it skips validation of everything except PoW and merkle path.

Do you think the detection could be automated?

Segwit 2X is **guaranteed** to cause chain split 3 months after segwit activation unless 100% nodes run it. BIP148 will not cause chain split if &gt;50% miners support it.

Splitting the coins between multiple exchanges is only diversification - it actually increases the risk that *part* of your coins will be stolen.

Well it's basically kind of DoS and that is often viewed as security issue... But I understand that's not what they had in mind. My guess is that the system displayed something like "The key for your address was already registered." and they freaked out. If it displayed "API key requests for this address are blocked. Contact customer support." maybe they wouldn't? But that's just a guess.
Anyway, we have these possibilities:
* They thought it was security vulnerability by mistake. -&gt; They should state it publicly and apologize.
* They are intentionally lying. -&gt; Their reputation will be damaged if this is found. The motive for this is difficult to find.
* You are mistaken and they already got something. -&gt; They will probably publish it and the reputation of bc.i will go down.
* You are lying. -&gt; Your reputation will be damaged greatly if found out.
* The vulnerability is there, you are lying to protect users but actively working on a fix and they help you with that.
* Something else?

That's why I wrote "kinda". They pre-mined 2M coins, if I remember correctly. To operate full node (and receive the reward), you must lock 2k coins. So the first miners could easily setup 1k nodes and do Sybil attacks.

I don't know anybody who assumes that.
Running a full node isn't vote itself. Running a full node and **receiving/accepting** Bitcoins via that node is. E.g. if a miner mines more than 12.5M BTC in a block, he can't sell the block to anyone running full node, because he wouldn't accept it. Similarly, if someone mines BIP148-invalid block, he can sell mined coins to old nodes but not to BIP148 nodes. Thus, BIP148 coins have lower value. If there are enough economically important nodes, the miners must mine BIP148 if they don't want to lose money.

No, probability is normally high, but it's never sure. Making invalid block with valid PoW is easy (apart from having to spend resources for PoW). This is true especially if there is a fork - one chain is considered valid, the other not.


Even then, the nodes must download specific transactions. Although, it might be easier to do anonymously.


I think you missed or misunderstood the details how "lower threshold" is actually implemented. Go google "BIP91". (TL;DR: 80 nodes will orphan everyone who doesn't signal BIP141 thus causing BIP141 activation to be 100%.)


In the unfortunate case of SegWit2x, the wallet would have to calculate the block size (and so probably receive all transactions from specific block).

I didn't account for this in my analysis, I was thinking only about simple case where receiver is the one running full node (which is considered ideal).
I think making people pay for access would be quite easy. It doesn't even have to be trustless (because using someone else's node isn't trustless by definition).


Of course, on the other hand making block size so small that I can run bitcoin on 8 bit AVR (e.g. Arduino) would be crazy. It is important to ensure small nodes can verify but also the limit shouldn't be too low. Finding the sweet spot is the challenge.

While we could argue all days what's the best block size, I think that ignores the fact that SegWit exists and enables LN. I believe that there is still a huge potential of scaling without requiring block size increase.
Whether the block size is too large already is a very good question. Some people argue that it is. Anyway I think that it's impossible to know the answer until the effects of SegWit are fully observed.

If SW was activated, it'd enable LN which would make costs lower than with any size of blocks. (Waiting time/risk of double spend is a cost too!) The Core devs chose the best scaling alternative. Let's activate it!
@_date: 2017-07-07 08:34:10
With SW the datacenters won't be needed or won't be as costly.


This certainly isn't true. I want to use Segwit regardless of block size - even if it were infinite. Why? Because I want to buy groceries with BTC too and I don't want to wait 10 minutes when paying.

@_date: 2017-07-06 17:31:04
Maybe I wasn't clear. I'd be worse if you already have a *pruned* full node because you'd have to somehow rewind it's database so it could start from last valid block (in case of split).

I think you should read [asicboost whitepaper]( It doesn't skip any verification of blocks. It only removes Expander1 from the loop.
If everyone could use it and did use it, the miners would be equal and mining ~20% faster. Difficulty would increase appropriately. Just as it did when transitioning CPU-&gt;GPU-&gt;FPGA-&gt;ASIC.
The problem here is that not all miners can do it safely (due to patents) and it also blocks protocol upgrades.

You are welcome! I'm open to clarifying anything or provide more information if you want.
@_date: 2017-05-07 10:36:19
While your point is completely valid, there is other way to do it: assuming LN is a thing in both LTC and BTC, you can send the coins via someone else who has LTC. Even longer chains are possible. E.g. Alice sends BTC to Bob sends it to Carol who is holding both BTC and LTC and willing to exchange so he then sends LTC to David and then David sends LTC to Ellen, the one who wanted LTC for products.
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:30:14

The whitepaper isn't some kind of Bible. You should think for yourself first. Bitcoin is not only about proof of work. There's a simple way to prove that: what would happen if more than 50% of miners decided to create blocks with higher block reward? Why they don't do it?
If everyone will rely on everyone else running full node, guess how many people will run it?

@_date: 2017-07-03 20:29:22
Thank you for honest interest! I will try to answer as well as I can.
1) I don't know of any. I've read a claim that it's beneficial for miners to stay quiet about it but I don't know why. I'd be happy to know more about this.
2) I think you don't mean that actual list but set of all BIP148 miners, right? Yeah, hashrate &lt;50% is risk of a chain split but that risk itself is motivation for miners not to mine non-BIP141 blocks.
In other words, if a miner mines BIP141 block right after Aug 1, he will have coins on both chains later. If he intentionally causes the split he will have the coins only on one chain. Therefore it's less risky for miners to activate SW.
The only reason for a miner to not mine BIP141-signalling block is that he is against it so much he's willing to risk block reward (~$33000 incl. fees) to prevent it.
Assuming this, it might be even profitable to try to orphan BIP148-invalid blocks, because of increased chance of this succeeding. (But I'm not much sure about this.)
So while chain split could happen in theory, it probably won't because of the incentives. (Remember, the whole Bitcoin is built on incentives.)
3) 2) is probably false, but I'm going to provide my experience. I've heard many interesting arguments against HF. Some people consider the block size to be security parameter, others fear contention, others want income from fees to be as high as possible (so the fees would replace block reward seamlessly, without hashrate drop), etc. I can't say for all, so here's my stance:
Imagine you had a big (e.g. 1TB) raw video and you wanted to transfer it to your friend over a slow network connection, what would you try first, compressing the video or buying more bandwidth? I guess most people would try compression first.
Now, of course SW isn't actually compression, but it has similar property: it enables decreasing network burden using LN. It also paves us path toward Schnorr signatures and MAST - those are very close to actual compression. (They really do decrease TX sizes.)
Here's my statement:
If there comes a time when SegWit is activated, LN is working or definitelly proven impossible, Schnorr signatures and MAST are implemented and there are still significant transaction costs when using Bitcoin and nobody comes up with anything better, I will accept a broadly reviewed, well-tested hard fork.

I don't know what he's referring to but the worst thing that can happen due to HF is chain split and it'll be just like Bitcoin was few years ago. So what? The old chain lives on and all those people that didn't understand Bitcoin will lose in the long term.
Remember when MtGox was a thing? Many people said at that time "Don't keep your money at exchanges!" people didn't listen, they lost money. Those who made right judgement didn't lose any.

I think that any network with possibility of creating LN has better resistance than same network that differs only in not having possibility of creating LN. That's because LN channels are more difficult to censor.

Depends on pool. Slushpool allows miners to vote with their hashpower. There might be others that do so too. Some pools don't.

If many people try to move coins at that time, the Blockchain might be full and your coins won't confirm in time.
@_date: 2017-07-12 22:09:46
It certainly is sufficient. Old chain would reject it, HF chain would require it. It's practically same thing as mandatory huge block. The only difference is that it's easier to implement mining software for my suggestion and easier to verify for SPV wallets if they choose so.
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:34:52
Yes, I think. LN brings great improvements in capacity, enables practically instant transactions, improves privacy, decreases burden imposed on network and enables "streaming economy" (that is instead of paying for e.g. electricity each month, one could pay for kW each second).
Sure, there are trade-offs. The most notable is a change in threat model. Instead of relying on configurations one must rely on his ability to get specific transaction into block soon enough. That might be impossible if the network is overloaded.
This brings us back to scaling problem. But now we at least can calculate stuff. Let's say that the default timeout for channels will be two weeks. Then if there are n open channels, the network must be capable of confirming n transactions per two weeks in non-adversial scenario.
In adversial scenario, it must be more costly for the attacker to fill the blockchain than what he would gain from cheating.
So in ab extreme case when only a single transaction fits into block, we would have 1tx/10min. If there were 1M open channels, that would mean they must have timeout at least 10M minutes (~19 years). In other words, with 1tx block size, if there were 1M open channels, people would have to set timeout to ~19 years for cases where the other party is unresponsive.
I think 19 years would be too much for most people.
I guess that if all 7B people use BTC+LN and each uses 6 channels on average (so there are 7B*6/2 channels because each channel has two ends). Let's assume people are willing to wait at most 2 months. That would mean we need at least 4051tps - about 1350 times more than what we currently have. That'd translate into about 1350MB block size.
Note that this scenario is pessimistic in assuming that half people will ever want to unilaterally close all channels at once. This scenario is also optimistic in assuming those people are not attackers.
Completely pessimistic scenario would lead to block size of several gigabytes. More realistic scenario would assume that everyone unilaterally closing all channels will never happen. In that case, we could assume some average life of a channel. For average life being half year (pessimistic, IMHO) and 21B channels, we would need ~1332tps: 444MB block size.

Let's forget about forks/splits and consider just the value of the network. Compare these two chains:
Chain 
* Allows more transactions
* Allows bigger transactions (possibly exploitable to attack the network)
Chain 
* Allows more transactions
* Allows bigger transactions to some extent (and mitigates the potential exploit)
* Allows more advanced contracts including payment channels, LN, inheriting Bitcoins, atomic coin swaps....
* Makes it easier to use HW wallets
* Makes it easier to upgrade scripting language in the future
Which of the two is more valuable?

Preventing wipeouts works by making a block that is invalid on main chain and valid on new chain - 2M block rule is just that. Spending invalid TX is invalid on main chain but it could be allowed in a single block on the hardforked chain.

It's interesting how they closed it with reasoning that it's "troll issue". I think that they didn't understand the concept.
I'm sw developer myself and here's explanation: whenever something in the code says it does "X" but it actually does "Y", it's a dangerous "foot gun". Future reviewers will likely be confused by that and this will likely lead to bugs.

That's how Bitcoin is supposed to work. When spending coins, they must be split between receiver and spender. If the "paper wallet" is BIP32 seed, then you're safe.

So far, I can tell your setup may be more secure in case the encryption software xor wallet is bad (by error or backdoor) at encrypting. If they use different algorithms, you are also more secure against cryptographic attacks (attacker would have to break two ciphers, not just one).

I mean accepting nodes, of course! Not all running instances...


Segwit would be orphaned only for those 60% non-upgraded nodes. Upgraded nodes would see their own chain. That would be the real chain split. SegWit is technology desired by many. It'd be beneficial for people to switch to SegWit chain. Then the old chain would lose and it'd be wiped out. 
Performing 51% attack would be very costly and it'd expose the legacy chain to similar attacks.


That's not the actual incentive. The incentive is that any fully-validating node would reject (ignore) such a block because it'd be considered invalid. The only things you can do if you have enough PoW:
* Rewrite history
* Censor transactions
* Mine invalid (worthless) blocks

Well it's basically kind of DoS and that is often viewed as security issue... But I understand that's not what they had in mind. My guess is that the system displayed something like "The key for your address was already registered." and they freaked out. If it displayed "API key requests for this address are blocked. Contact customer support." maybe they wouldn't? But that's just a guess.
Anyway, we have these possibilities:
* They thought it was security vulnerability by mistake. -&gt; They should state it publicly and apologize.
* They are intentionally lying. -&gt; Their reputation will be damaged if this is found. The motive for this is difficult to find.
* You are mistaken and they already got something. -&gt; They will probably publish it and the reputation of bc.i will go down.
* You are lying. -&gt; Your reputation will be damaged greatly if found out.
* The vulnerability is there, you are lying to protect users but actively working on a fix and they help you with that.
* Something else?

It's a secret sequence of bits (1s and 0s) which allows you and only you to spend the bitcoins.  If you tell that to someone or someone copies it from you, that person can spend your coins.
In case of web services it often happens that the services has the keys and user don't. In that case if the service decides to stop or is attacked, users can lose the coins.
The most secure way of storing bitcoins is keeping the keys hidden from anyone else. The most convenient and secure way is bitcoin Trezor (or other well-designed hardware wallets).

It might be very similar to coinbase.

There's one thing a node can't verify without independent connection: that there doesn't exist a longer chain. If the node connects to them only they can censor longer chain.

You're actually right. Most smart contracts people invented don't make sense because they still need third party. However, there are few that don't.
* Bets/casinos - you already mentioned it
* Lightning network - it's more a technical solution, not something new, but it's still very useful
* Inheriting bitcoins - it's possible to make contract that makes some money spendable only if someone is offline for longer than e.g. two months. Being offline for too long is likely due to death, so this can be used for making coins inheritable without any testaments, attorneys, courts... (BTW to make implementation practical SegWit is needed.)
Also take a look at truthcoin/hivemind. That explores other ways when contracts are combined with game theory.
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:10:29
My point is that validating is stronger than PoW. It is the thing that determines whether miners should get the reward in the first place.
In case of fork, there might be a good reason to follow minority chain with different rules. (E.g. attempt to raise 21M inflation limit.)


I meant the hard fork part of the fork. SegWit2x makes it consensus rule that 3 months after SegWit activation there must be a block bigger than 1MB (so-called wipeout protection).
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:30:41
In that case you're using same cipher with different passwords twice (Electrum uses AES too.) It's not dangerous in any way. Single encryption is normally enough. In your case, you are in addition better protected from implementation bugs (and possibly also PRNG bias).

I did review it too. Indeed "a pile of steaming feces." is huge exaggeration. From my review:
* version number is weird
* btc1 endangers SPV wallets by refusing to use HF bit
* recent event on testnet proved that they didn't solve mining algorithm yet (that part which should fill HF block to &gt; 1M)
* they changed the policy that only they can file issues (outsiders issues are auto-closed) - it's basically another version of "development behind closed door"
But again, the code itself is nice and clean. I've seen much worse stuff in other code.

@_date: 2017-07-02 18:33:55
Because I want to *receive* transaction and the most sure way to know whether received bitcoins are genuine is to validate whole chain.
Also, I care about my privacy, I don't want other nodes to know in which transactions I'm interested.
Finally, given possibility that in one month there will be more chains and SPV wallets will follow one which has more work even if I consider it invalid, running full node is absolutely necessary.

Well, the version number wasn't updated correctly. It should be one of these:
* `0.14.3` - to indicate fully compatible fixes (no API change)
* `0.15.0` - to indicate backward-compatible changes
* `1.0.0` - to indicate incompatible changes
Based on changes this proposes, the correct version number should be `1.0.0`. Using `1.14.3` is misleading because it suggests versions `1.0.0`-`1.14.2` do exist, which obviously isn't the case here.
Edit: also, since first digit is `0`, it usually means "in development". Bumping to `1.0.0` would mean "stabilization". Therefore `0.15.0` would be also acceptable.

There are two ways people use paper wallets: single private key, seed. If your paper wallet contains 12-24 words, it's seed and you're fine (but still not much more secure than using regular wallet! Use HW wallet for large amounts of money.) If your wallet looks like single string of letters and numbers, then you have several problems (almost zero privacy, potential loss of funds).

I don't have anything against Ledger, just I'd like to point out that SatoshiLabs (company behind Trezor) might have higher reputation.
They were first to come up with HW wallets and they design them really well from the beginning. (For example, Ledger at first started making cheap HW wallets without display that are certainly less secure. Trezor had display and physical buttons from the beginning.) 
Also Trezor is Open Source including firmware and it has been reviewed by many specialists. Ledger has closed firmware.
If you are unsure, maybe buying both and doing multi-sig might be good idea.

If you put your seed into computer you've just destroyed the very reason you have HW wallet. Granted, you suggest to mix the words. This provides you 24! (24 factorial) security which is just a little bit more than 79 bits. The original security of seed is 256 bits. That doesn't mean it's three times less. It's cube root of that - very different.
All this under condition that you mix the words before putting them into computer and you used dice and some math to mix them. Most people wouldn't be capable of doing that correctly. If you can, congrats! Just please don't suggest that to random people on the Internet, or they'll end up like the OP.

Maybe better term than "bring about cetralization" would be "increases centralization".
Bitcoin stands on ability of all participants to verify all the rules and so determine if the coins they receive are valid. This ensures that even 51% miners can't change much (at worst do 51% attacks which are very obvious).
Increasing block size causes verification become more costly and it's harder for nodes to determine if the coins are valid.
Of course, too small block size causes another form of centralization - users using other services to hold their private keys.
The difficult question is: where's the sweet spot?

You seem to misunderstand security. It is completely irrelevant to which PC one connects Trezor. The private key is in Trezor (possibly encrypted) and never leaves it. Trezor does signing and only after making sure the user is authorized to do it.
Since the code of Trezor is much smaller than code of OS, it's much more simple to verify it.
Yes, using airgaped computer instead of Trezor is possible but the security is about the same (maybe even worse) for higher amount of money and huge hassle. Remember, RPi isn't enough, you need also display, keyboard, SD card and power source. All those things are easy to tamper with.

Trezor would show different transaction on display.


This would be very difficult. The firmware is signed and if you try to flash unsigned firmware the device wipes itself.


So what? You can't modify signed transaction (if you could, whole Bitcoin wouldn't work - that's the point of signatures).


You can have two wallets in Trezor and nobody can prove you have the second.


If he records the screen of Trezor, yes this is a problem. I think it'd be pretty easy to defend against this, though.

Even then, if the HW wallet is implemented correctly (at least Trezor is), the attacker must have physical access to the device while the wallet is doing a crypto operation. This is (again in case of Trezor) possible only if user entered PIN.
In other words, the attacker would have to connect a quite large and expensive device to the USB cable while the victim is using it. The victim would've to be blind to not notice that.

I see your point. The other side is that if there are two groups of developers and one group makes less mistakes/less often, then it is desirable that that group works on more critical software then the other group.
So the question boils down to: is there any alternative to Mycelium with developers who do mistakes less often? I don't have stats right now, so I don't know. I'm using Schildbach's wallet anyway because of ability to point it to my node.

Strictly speaking, &gt;50% hashrate is necessary to prevent invalid chain (containing transactions that spend without a valid SegWit signature) to become longer than the valid chain.
It's more profitable for miners to mine coins accepted by economic majority (as an example, if someone mined block that mints &gt;12.5BTC he couldn't sell those coins). If economic majority prefers SegWit, miners should switch to it and so enforce SegWit rules.

Change 1 to 2 and sighash operations change four times. Everyone has to upgrade. If single node doesn't upgrade, it's stuck. If single miner doesn't upgrade, it's a chain split.
I wouldn't call this extremely simple. Nevertheless Segwit is already there. No point in stalling it further. Almost no additional cost for activating it.
Also, for black markets Segwit is much more interesting because it allows LN which enables much higher privacy.

If the amount is low then people might not care to enforce the rules. The risk is lower if the rules are enforced by many people. It's very similar to BIP148 scenario. If many people enforce the new rules, the failure is less likely.
That is why total amount should be high - it ensures lower risk. (E.g. if total amount was 12M bitcoins, I'd be almost sure it won't fail.)

Well, the problems with money:
0. Someone can steal it
1. Someone could double-spend
2. Someone could print new
3. Someone can fake it
If you think about it, the last three are practically the same. It doesn't matter for me whether I can print new money, double spend existing money or create fake money that is indistinguishable from real (or that it'd take a long time for people to find out)
Now, it seems Opendime doesn't solve problem  (anyone with physical access can take it). Bitcoin itself (in the form of HW wallet with good backup) can help with that.
It doesn't solve  because AFAIK it can't guarantee there don't exist two devices with the same private key. Example of how I could abuse that if I had the ability to create 2 devices with same private keys, I can just send $100 to the respective address. If I do so, they'd appear to both have balance $100. If I go to two separate people and sell the devices for $100, I would have $200 now. Those two people would unknowingly hold coins that can disappear (if the other one redeems the device).
Problem  is solved by Bitcoin itself. But if I can repeat problem  at scale, what is the difference?
Regarding  one of the two dimes with identical private keys can be considered fake. Yet from what I understand there's no way to know that without having two devices with same private key (address).
@_date: 2016-07-15 15:47:18

@_date: 2017-06-30 13:56:48
If your computer is compromised, you are screwed already.
Bitcoin Core defends you agains many network attacks (fraud - invalid blocks, forks...) It also provides you highest privacy (you seem to be interested in all transactions from the point of view of attacker).
The only security issue with Core is that it doesn't support HW wallets. For maximum security, you can install your own Electrum server (which connects to Bitcoin Core) and then use Trezor with Electrum.

You can encrypt and you must use some OS to do it. OS is large, complex software and so it has huge probability of containing bugs. This is the point of HW wallets - to have small, simple and easily verifiable software. Someone could write a software just for writing seed to SSD but at that point HW wallet would be much cheaper and simpler.
I'm not saying paper wallet is the only secure way. I'm saying that using SSD defeats the purpose of having HW wallet.
I believe that for most use cases having Trezor and several paper backups is the best. For more money, you should replace the paper with crypto steel. If you have millions, you should use multiple HW wallets from different manufacturers to form a multisig, having each wallet backed-up in cryptosteel stored on different continents.

Using ad hominem won't make Opendime more valuable. :)


HW wallets are the only thing protecting Bitcoins even if the computer is compromised. Opendime can't protect against computer being compromised (hint: it doesn't have display to check destination address). Thus, if you assume the computer is safe, you can do everything with computer for zero additional price. Not to mention that if you use 5 Opendimes, you just spent one Trezor.


Paper/image on screen is less expensive, that's the point


You probably misunderstood. I was talking about specific attack vector that is possible in case the machine is compromised. A malware can swap addresses easily. HW wallets protect you from this because you can check the address on their screen and you must physically press buttons. Opendime doesn't have screen so once the computer is compromised, you don't know what you are signing.


Funny. First you claim that Opendime should not be initialised when bought, thus precluding use for off-chain transactions, now you claim it should be. Please pick one and stick to it (or admit that you picked wrong - I won't judge you, I was wrong many times too).


So what? They can't do anything with it. And even if they can, it's easy to simply not have it. Or have empty one. Actually, if you try to hide any device and you're caught, you have big problem. If you are so paranoid, you should memorise the seed anyway. Also, Opendime has no authentication mechanism, so if they seize it, they can spend it.


If you're trying to escape bad political regime, you will be happy to leave $100 behind. If you plan to return, just keep the Trezor at home.


Nobody with any sense would accept any off-chain transaction, except LN and maybe anything from good friends.


Those solutions are most probably broken.

You could say this about every technology. I myself imagine "AI wallet" which could have some algorithm to automatically manage funds in LN. So the users wouldn't have to think about it too much. I'd look much like today's wallets.


This is important concern. It can be mitigated by longer channel timeouts and lower channel amounts. Also, since you can spend all attackers money on fees, this makes it quite easy to outbid everyone. Just don't let the attacker drain his side of channel completely. (Ensure he has enough to close the channel.)


If the user has no more bitcoins he needs to refill anyway. Refilling can go through the channel (in opposite direction).
Using streaming, people could get their paycheques more often so their channels would be re-balanced. The only people who have a problem are hoarders.


Obviously the more TXses goes through the channel the cheaper it becomes. If I was running LN node I'd configure decreasing fees for each channel. So the longer you keep the channel open, the lower fees you get. This would incentivise people to not close channels too often.


I believe that having even a single channel with someone you transact often is beneficial already (think of prepaid services). Give it time and the network will get bigger.


Of course, it isn't. I'm not trying to convince you that it is. What I'm trying to say that those problems are most probably solvable. But let's just wait and see what it can do.


Sure betting everything on it would be bad idea. What do you think about playing it safe? First activate SegWit, wait if LN solves the problem and increase the limit once we find it is insufficient. If LN proves to be sufficient, just keep it as is.

Did **you** read the text? It says side-channel attacks. Do you know what side channel attacks are?
The vulnerabilities have been patched two years ago. Not just patched. Whole class of side channel attacks was mitigated by requiring PIN before any crypto operation.
And as I said, every device is vulnerable to side channel attacks. If you use good HW wallet, they are very difficult to perform. If you use a random PC or RPi, there's much higher chance of the attacks being successful.
Finally, I advise you to stop underestimating people you don't know. I use Linux and work for a security company. I've probably researched more about security than 99% of population.
To be clear: I'm not angry. This is just a friendly advice for you, because next time you might meet someone who is more likely to get angry.

I think miners should have at least a day. (While it's possible to upgrade in short time, we should account for time zones and possible troubles miners could encounter.)
The way it works now is any miner that sees support being close to 80% should upgrade immediately to avoid risk of being orphaned. this in turn means that the activation threshold  is actually less than 80%.
This is good for people who want SegWit but might be perceived as unfair for others.
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:25:15
As an additional safety measure I suggest not using Bitcoin until the situation resolves. (It might resolve prior to 1 August by activating SegWit.)
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:50:59
I don't know any link that I could recommend but here's a simple explanation: it works almost exactly like payment channels (lightning network). You commit a 2oo2 transaction with possible recovery after `n` blocks, then you create another transaction which swaps coins and allows the other party to take all your coins if you cheat, the other party makes the same. Then you can collaboratively close the channel or recover if the other party fails to cooperate.

@_date: 2018-12-10 06:44:47


Still not a reason to use cloud backup, even encrypted. Why? Because people are unable to choose good passwords - that's why we have generated seeds instead of asking people to select one. If you're able to choose good password and remember it, you might just use that one hashed as private key (or simply remember the seed).

@_date: 2017-06-09 12:18:20
This is true. I wonder how getting one confirmation for transaction compares to getting no confirmation, though. Say one pays small amount and waits only for one confirmation in Litecoin vs. using Bitcoin and not waiting for confirmation.

Corret. (BTW, running full node is irrelevant in case of sending TX. Only receiving matters.)

Anyway, I believe that SegWit will increase the value in the long run regardless of how it will be activated.
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:03:48
Yeah, I guess the block size increase will be necessary anyway. How much and when should probably be determined after we see effects of LN.
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:13:17
OK, so my commitment here: I will accept a reasonable block size increase when following conditions are met
* SegWit is activated
* LN works for at least few months or is proven failed project
* Schnorr signatures are implemented
* MAST is implemented
* TX fees are very high
* Nobody invented a better scaling idea
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:22:54

UTXO commitment in the blockchain would help. (Of course, it wouldn't guarantee full security but it could provide at least partial security while the node syncs.)
I mitigated the download problem by copying existing blockchain from my own computer to another node. If you need to do this with VPS, just check the hashes.
Edit: regarding compression: I've created an algorithm that can save up to 13% in case of simple transaction. It resulted in about 3% for whole blockchain (too many weird transactions, I guess). I didn't have much time to improve it further.
@_date: 2017-06-29 12:29:01
The problem with Ledger Nano and other display-less wallets is that they are not very secure. Since one can't easily check the amount being sent, they don't provide much more security over using just a computer.
If you don't have many coins, you don't need HW wallet. If you do have many coins, don't search for cheapest but for the most secure.

@_date: 2017-06-17 00:36:02
One way to make it work would be to just lock the coins for the time of drivechain development. The situation would look like this:
* Competent developers promise to implement OP_DRIVECHAIN_CHECK and expect deployment in at worst `n` months (the deployment should be MASF with UASF deadline, probably).
* People who wish to transfer A-&gt;B  create a special transaction that locks the coins for `n` months and after `n` months they become anyone-can-spend.
* The soft fork forbids spending those anyone-can-spend coins against the rules.
This would work just requiring soft fork. (I guess we don't need soft fork for the first part.)
The obvious problem is: what if it doesn't activate? In that case anyone who put there money is screwed. But it might be seen as an interesting trade-off for some people.
Disclaimer: I'm not endorsing it and I probably wouldn't risk putting there large stash. Just want to point out it's possible.
Edit: it'd be possible to incentivize developers by "sending" them coins via the other chain. So if they implement Drivechain they'd have the coins secured. If they don't they'd risk losing the reward.
Another thing that might be possible: many people commit to activating by sending their money to the other chain. Maybe this could be doable in Lighthouse style.

LN coincidentally solves both problems. For LN to be practical malleability needs to be fixed. SegWit is currently prepared and tested way to fix malleability. Let's activate this first and bump block size if it'll be still needed.

Developing Open Source code is trustless process - everyone can check what the code is doing. Anyone claiming otherwise either doesn't understand Open Source or doesn't understand programming, or both.

The point is the first user will load it with Bitcoins and then he'll be able to exchange it for something with someone else. There's no point in buying Opendime for personal use - classic HW wallets are better.

Spending from them yes (bigger script -&gt; bigger transaction).
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:21:02
I can see why infinite block size would cause profit to be lower. What I'm not sure is why would just little bigger block cause the profit to be lower.
Eg. if block can contain 1000 TXs and after increase it could contain 1001 TXs which would be bigger? `1000*price_before` or `1001*price_after`? Obviously, `price_before &gt; price_after`, but how big is the difference and why?
My feeling is that the result isn't same in case when blocks are bigger than what people want (as was the case until recently) as in case when people want to send more TXs than what fits into block.
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:37:16

If you're storing a key in cloud, you need to remember:
* which cloud it is
* username
* password to access cloud
* decryption password (must NOT be the same as cloud password!!!)
You could generate your username and clout password from decryption password by doing SHA256(decryption password), so that you only remember provider and password.
However, if your password isn't secure enough, it can be guessed. If your password is secure enough, you could simply remember the key itself and avoid risk of the cloud shutting down.
The only thing cloud solution achieves is bigger risk.

@_date: 2017-06-22 07:27:59
I don't see any value in that case. It's much better to do cold storage with Trezor or other HW wallet. Benefits:
* Nobody can swap destination address nor amount
* It's reusable - no need to break it
You can still give someone your address in form of QR code.
Yes, it's more secure than counterfeiting bills. I still doubt any Opendime would be opened soon as it destroys the device and so the loaded dime has higher value.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:08:38

@_date: 2017-06-22 07:34:10
Denying security vulnerability doesn't make it go away. :)
I explain this once again:
* The **manufacturer** knows how the PRNG is biased.
* He can create private keys with his own (biased) entropy.
* He can send coins to the address
* He can sell the dime and act as he's some random guy - there's no way to prove that the device you received was generated with good entropy
Of course, this applies only if Opendime is meant to be usable as cash. If not, then there's no point in using it, since HW wallets are much better.

Correct. If there are two forks (Bitmain and BIP148), there will be 3 coins.

1. I'm not sure about this but as far as I understand the discount isn't consensus rule, so if a miner disagrees, he should be able to change it. I might be wrong though. Also I believe that the discount is based on some research but I agree that it should've been linked for everyone to see and verify.
2. I think that the article is simplified for general audience. Witness data should definitely be available for some time. The thing is there is no need to keep it in RAM (whole UTXO is in RAM) but it can be stored on disk. As far as I understand, so far the witness data is in RAM because it's not segregated. After Segwit, the witness data is used for verification and then stored to disk and removed from RAM.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:17:32
Yes, in case BIP148 doesn't go well. Since Bitmain intends to drop off the legacy chain, it makes chance of activating BIP148 higher. This makes it more likely that there will be two chains: Bitmain chain and BIP148.

@_date: 2017-06-10 21:11:47
Ah, I see now. That makes sense. I should've thought more about it.
@_date: 2017-06-23 08:13:26
You must've used bad source of information. The whole point of Trezor is for private keys in any form (encrypted or not) to never ever touch PC or phone and certainly not the Internet.
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:35:58
Ah, OK, thanks for explanation!
@_date: 2015-02-08 13:35:32
It's the same now. If you are rich enough you can pay some private security company, if not, you have just the police.
Why it shouldn't be based on lottery? Bitcoin mining is based on lottery too and it works well.

Why do you think it'd be expensive? It can be in your phone, which you probably already have.
It may not be 100% reliable but it still may be pretty good. If there are multiple paths between people, you can route-around even if one channel breaks.
I already experienced debit cards not working or outright broken, so I don't see much difference.
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:10:24
I see what you did there. :)
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:52:30
Reference implementation is far from the printing press.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:17:15


Can you specifically explain why do you think it was bluff?
@_date: 2017-06-02 06:33:03
Why do you think so?
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:38:29
Even if Satoshi mined 1M coins, so what? He created a software with potential to free humanity from oppressive governments. I don't know if it'll be successful but if it will, he truly deserves to live happy, in financial freedom for the rest of his life.
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:33:50
I understand well what he explains and everything. I would like to know just one thing: Why the discount is 80%? How it was calculated? I couldn't find explanation.
I'd really love if someone pointed me at the right direction.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:43:08


Sounds more like the author bought some drugs...


They really don't get it...
I suppose it's not worth my time.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:30:46
BIP148 code is actually very short and easy to understand. SW2X would be much larger. Maintaining all versions at once might turn into nightmare.
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:23:28


This is certainly not true because the blockchain time is used instead of current time. So any chain that contains a non-signalling block between 1 August and 15 November will be rejected by BIP148 nodes.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:18:02
Did you read my comment?
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:41:07
Yeah, I've read it somewhere already. But your post gives a good idea of how it could work pretty well with Bitcoin. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:59:50


I'd disagree even with this. Attack scenario:
* Government coerces the manufacturers to create 100001 identical dimes (with same private keys). And load it with $10. (So the amount shows up on each.)
* They then spread the dimes evenly
* The government just successfully printed $1000000 worth bitcoins.
Of course, the moment someone finds two identical dimes a huge "dime run" begins - everyone will send the coins from the dime to normal address.
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:53:37
More than what terrorists, murderers, rapists and thieves get.
@_date: 2017-06-02 06:45:07
Ah, it makes more sense now. My calculation shows that if everyone on Earth used Ltc, then everyone could open or close channel once every ~18 years. I guess this will need to improve. But who knows?
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:23:11
That'd be nice if you managed to do it in verifiable way. (To all those who'd think it's not trustless anymore: you had to trust someone when downloading genesis hash and the software.)
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:42:05
Why don't you try the attack yourself and publish your results? It'd be great for your reputation to refute some hoax, don't you think?
Do you even know who Jochen Hoenicke is? Go, do some research on him. I assure you that I trust him more than some other random stranger on the Internet. But in case of doubt, I could verify that myself. (I can get TREZOR and osciloscope easily.)

days ago...
BIP91 can't prevent BIP148 split.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:54:48
This is the first time I saw this table. I think we should make it more visible.
@_date: 2016-07-17 16:54:15
Ah, thank you for explanation. I forgot about this possibility (I don't use Reddit too much - I'm just reading like two subs.)
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:55:08
Nice vid! Of course, I wasn't making claims about what happened. Was just joking. :)
@_date: 2017-06-05 12:48:45
Have you read the Peter Todd's article on the topic?
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:40:30
I doubt that the machine is smart enough to recognize a fake ID.
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:40:23


Don't worry, it won't.
@_date: 2017-06-29 15:33:07
If you want the highest possible security, use Bitcoin Core with pruning turned on. It will throw away unneeded parts of the Blockchain, so it'll consume much less disk space.
If you are OK with worse security, try Electrum.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:41:33
Ah, it totally forgot that this abbr could be applicable in this context.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:52:36
already explained it, so just let me add this: I believe that Opendime people are honest. I don't believe that government wouldn't coerce them into providing private key (and thus allowing inflation by double spending).
Maybe if the factory key was multi-signed by many people, each being in different country (so all governments would have to work together to compromise it), then it'd be quite interesting.
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:17:54


I actually think many people are that stupid. Fortunately, not all people.
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:27:27
How is Ledger very safe if you can not confirm destination address nor amount of bitcoins to pay?
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:35:06


HW wallet is more convenient with about the same cost (you need display, uncompromised keyboard, SD card and power supply too!) and security.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:38:59
You could release using Tor and receive donations in Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-06-16 08:39:27
I believe reference implementation is more like "able to control how production works".
Note that stupid changes to Core (like raising 21M limit) would be probably (hopefully) rejected by people.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:51:48
That might be good explanation too.
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:54:21
Just covert version.
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:48:03
It is implemented. That's what you get by running Bitcoin Core with -prune=x.
Unfortunately, it doesn't help scaling because the whole blocks must always be transmitted over the network and validated.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:39:31
Thinking about it again, it may be quite difficult. But maybe solvable. So the steps could be:
* Download Raspbian image and check it's hash.
* Skip configuration steps from the guide
* Download the code, verify checksum (and write down the checksum)
* Download and install required packages. Copy the packages outside the Pi.
* Compile Bitcoin Core deterministically (I think someone already solved this)
* Install Core
* shutdown Pi
* take out SD card and put it into other machine
* clean up logs and /home/pi/.bash_history
* repeat these steps (with the exception that you install the packages from external source) to create an identical image
* if image differs, find where and invent appropriate fix
* repeat until you can get deterministic images every time
* sign the image
* publish the image, signature and instructions (ideally in form of executable script) for everyone to audit the image
* publish signatures of those who did the audit
BTW I noticed the guide suggests compiling with `--disable-wallet`. This is very bad idea because such node is pointless (if you don't verify your own transactions) and does nothing to help BIP148.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:01:28
Yes it was chain split. The interesting thing is that the chain with the bug had 0 value. Literally 0. Not even 0.00000000000000000000000000000000001. It wan't politics. It wasn't bailout. It wasn't new cool feature. It was absolutely necessary for Bitcoin to mean anything.
There was zero contention because it was impossible for people to disagree with that.
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:29:02
I'm not sure how much but I agree it could get very expensive.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:02:01
I'd point Mycelium to my full node in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, it's not possible now.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:48:22
Biased PRNG is enough.
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:35:25


Any useful soft fork, yes.


It could and if the difference of hash rates is too high, it probably will. 
What's important is that people switch chains by running nodes. Going to legacy chain means downgrading the software, which is something like hard fork.
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:36:18
There is a similar one in Bratislava. It's very robust and the bill acceptor would destroy the bills if opened violently.
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:30:11
From Satoshi's paper:


the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every
transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to
issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent.
The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the
company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.
If it's decentralized, how do you think govs could regulate it?
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:26:07
Why have a limit if it's increased every time before it's hit?
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:39:51
He said before everyone accepts it and while not everyone, segwit transactions indeed look **to old nodes** like anyone can spend. (But if anyone actually tried, he would find out that such TX isn't accepted in block.)

If you want to be an expert on cryptocurrencies, study computer science, Austrian economics, cryptography, game theory.
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:50:05
In that case I consider the security good enough. Also I don't think rooting is a problem if you don't give root permissions to bad applications.
@_date: 2017-06-24 09:09:03
SegWit (bit 1) signalling is at 36% now.
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:10:58
Just mind that it's not anonymous.
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:39:47
Ah, I see, thank you for explanation! It makes a lot of sense. What I'm unsure about is whether there exists any hardfork that would be non-controversial. But I'd agree that it's at least unlikely.
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:36:09
Nobody knows and those who say they know are probably mistaken. (If they really knew, they'd be billionaires.)
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:20:19
Why is something that lessens security of financial transactions the best invention since Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:46:07
That'd be very difficult. If you're paranoid, remove microphone and all radio communicators from your laptop, bring it to the woods, outside of civilisation, wrap the TREZOR in aluminium foil. Sign the transaction, then return home and broadcast.

@_date: 2017-06-22 13:00:38
Is there a protocol for negotiating fees implemented/designed already? I wonder if it'd be possible to calculate fees based on number of transactions the other side did. (More TXs -&gt; lower fee.)
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:36:47
In that case UASF is absolutely necessary.
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:21:07


The problem with scrypt is it's costly to validate and it doesn't prevent ASICs but makes them difficult. Barriers to entry are higher -&gt; possible centralisation.
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:27:37
? I don't know why but I tend to use multiple periods often...
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:26:11
Or simply misunderstanding how Open Source works and genuinely fearing Core is harmful.
