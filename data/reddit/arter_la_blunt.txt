Can one person please articulate why if the US banned crypto that is made owning, buying or holding Bitcoin a felony offense with up to five years in jail who would buy thus making the price go up?

Right. I think that if people traded wallet to wallet it would be difficult to police. Because what exactly is illegal code? That being said, if "crypto" were illegal the feds could get warrants for Google to turn over records of all those that have downloaded crypto apps and wallets. Then they get up addresses. They get warrants for phone companies. Then a warrant for your phone. Then a warrant for your home to search for a password. 
Also, once someone tried to withdraw funds to a federally insured bank account, the feds could get subpoenas for bank accounts that receive funds from certain known crypto-related entities. 
Again, why can no one articulate why this is good for bitcoin?

It's just wrong that it's only a 1 minute read. I have more than 1 minute worth of questions.

Be as reckless as you want just dont go complaining and asking the government to pass laws against bitcoin when you go tits up.

Why wouldn't a ban work? If the feds say it is a federal felony to buy, possess,  or sell crypto, why wouldn't everyone get out?
