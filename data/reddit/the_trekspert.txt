And what, exactly, happened with Mt Gox?
From what I gleaned (and I could be way off base), Mt. Gox embezzled the BTCs from their customers. How close am I?

If I was so inclined, I can have a wallet in three different places and move my stuff between them as much as I want?

Blockchain vs Green Address.

Still kinda confused on that issue. What exactly are keys?
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:26:32
Offline wallet as in a .exe?
Will it still track price rise/fall when internet connected?
ADDENDUM: Yeah. It'll mostly be for investment purposes. Just something to make a little cash on, and maybe to use my dividend to buy more.  I'll sort of be treating it like a fancy share of stock.

Groovy biscuits.
So, no problems with them hacking into your account and such?

As in if I buy $1 of BTC, I'll only get $.85?
Or do they charge you the purchase + $0.15?

I'm just looking for something to hold my $41 worth of BTC.

So, just to make sure:
The blockchain is the big room of safety deposit boxes and you have the only key to yours, and you and the others in the vault can have a big ol' swap meet if you'd like?
Coinbase, though, holds on to your SDB key?
And can I move my BTC to someone at another wallet? Haven't found a clear answer on that either.

Anybody familiar with Bitcoin Core?
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:24:32
I have Windows 7 with a full security suite. And an iPod Touch.

15%, you mean? Or 15 mBTC?
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:30:10
The amount I'm going to buy, once I find a wallet, yes.
I toyed with $100, but since BTC is still new, it could end up like investing in Apple in 1989, or it could end up like investing in Friendster.
As I said below, it's gonna be treated like a stock, with dividend buying extra fractions. Maybe, at some point, I'll have enough dividend to turn it into a full coin. -shrug-

How much more? Like adding on another .01, or more like .4-.9?
@_date: 2014-10-20 15:07:33
Go on
@_date: 2014-10-14 21:57:29
Well, thank you, my good sir!
