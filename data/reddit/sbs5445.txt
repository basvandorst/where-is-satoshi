Sorry, some people should really stop and think about their actions.  Hope they stop DDoSing you :(

Cool, I'll check it out!  Thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:04:50
Thanks for everything!

Whoa... this is allowed here?

I'm not running a full node for personal use... It's merely my way to give a little something back to the bitcoin project as a whole.  Also, excuse my ignorance, the last time I ran a full node was back in 2011.  I have yet to even perform the full node installation on my server.  I'm sure a lot has changed.

Hey... I tip too...

What's brown and sticky? 
A stick!

Basically I have a server and I want to contribute in some way to the overall success of bitcoin, even if its just a small amount.  If you can think of a better way to use the server then I am all ears.
Edit: server is remote
@_date: 2015-07-14 18:53:24
I could use a few bits.  Thanks for everything!
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:05:51
Cool, but I've already got hardware.  I'm just looking for monitoring software to keep an eye on things remotely.
@_date: 2015-04-25 01:33:42
Thanks... You are awesome!

You should make the site more mobile friendly.  It looks like trash in Chrome on my nexus 5.

I've been distant from for awhile, but man has it gotten toxic here.  How about we let the man post his extraordinary proof and then judge whether or not it's sufficient.
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:50:45
It's OK to be skeptical, I sure am, but the personal attacks are a bit out of line.
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:58:52
Hello :)

I disagree.  It could be that he has just chosen not to (for whatever reason).  Regardless, it's comments like this that have no place in the discussion.  Let's debate the proof once it's released.

I was trying to figure out how to do this for her.  I set her up with a BitPay account last night and tonight when I get off work I am going to setup some BitPay "Buy Now" buttons for the different card sets.  Stay tuned...
@_date: 2015-02-07 01:37:22
This becomes less true the more mainstream bitcoin becomes.  Besides, I have to believe there is someone on the other end of the blockchain for everyone!
@_date: 2015-02-06 23:20:46
I was in the process of setting her up a BitPay account.  I updated the post with the BitPay link.

Very sorry, the address has been removed!
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:26:12
Thanks... not exactly sure what this is.
@_date: 2015-02-06 18:16:45
Thanks, will do :)
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:54:58
You rock!  Thanks for the tip... I'll let my wife know you liked the first one.  Better yet, I might just tell her to login to my reddit account so she can thank you all personally.
