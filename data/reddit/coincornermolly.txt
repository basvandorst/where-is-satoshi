If you use Mastercard, you can withdraw GBP funds via Card Funds Transfer with no charge applied. Funds can take up to 3 working days to appear. Unfortunately Visa do not support Card Funds Transfer relating to cryptocurrency business at present.
Limits: £1000/day.
Alternatively, you can withdraw EUR to a bank account. This typically takes between 3-5 days.


We comply with local regulation so do require KYC from all users at some point (proof of address and ID) however we do allow some UK users to buy bitcoin without verification. At the point when you are asked to provide verification documents, our compliance team aim to review all accounts within 24 hours (excluding weekends).

Hi guys! Molly here from CoinCorner ( - a Bitcoin business based on the Isle of Man.
Thanks for sharing this link - we're excited to be part of this venture by the Isle of Man Government in to the cryptocurrency industry.
CoinCorner is actually the first cryptocurrency company in the world to fall under the Proceeds of Crime Act on the Isle of Man - having the Government formally acknowledge cryptocurrency is a global first!
We're excited - we hope you are too! Molly :)

Hey! Molly here from CoinCorner - a Bitcoin exchange based on the Isle of Man. I just wanted to jump in and say that we have been working closely with the IOM Government who have been very supportive! It's nice to have a Government that welcomes Bitcoin-related businesses and wants to see the industry succeed :)

Hi u/svet_sedov! Molly from [CoinCorner]( here - a bitcoin exchange operating from the Isle of Man. 
We were actually the first cryptocurrency exchange to launch on the IOM back in July 2014 and over the last 4 years, we have worked closely with the IOM Government and the IOMFSA to help establish suitable regulation for bitcoin businesses on the island. 
With regards to the introduction of regulation and the reduced 1000 EUR limit you mention: yes, the limit is low due to the unknown/uncharted territory of the crypto industry, however the IOMFSA are monitoring it and will hopefully increase the limits in the future.
More than happy to answer any other questions you have about bitcoin and the Isle of Man :)

Hi u/owenprescott - Molly from [CoinCorner]( here. Welcome back to the wonderful world of bitcoin! :)
We are a bitcoin exchange serving the UK and Europe. We accept GBP/EUR deposits via credit/debit card (instant), bank transfer and SEPA transfer.
We have a dedicated customer support team on hand to help (should you need it, of course) and our compliance team aim to review all accounts within 24 hours (if/when your account requires verification).
I hope this helps, but if you have any questions, feel free to ask! :)

Ps. With regards to your question about holding Bitcoins securely... as a business, we obviously encourage customers to make use of all the services we offer (we are an exchange and web wallet provider), however, it is best practice to store your Bitcoins (especially large amounts) offline/in a cold wallet. Ledger, Trezor etc. are popular choices.

What's fast is registering with coincorner.com (sorry, saw the opportunity and took it ;)) but in all seriousness, there's now no KYC documents to upload!

That's exactly it [u/Guy\_Incognito97]( We're rolling out our Bitcoin debit card early next year - our customers will be able to make everyday purchases with it (like any other debit card) only it will deduct Bitcoin instantly from their [CoinCorner]( wallet instead :)
It will help adoption as it will encourage people to use Bitcoin as a means of payment (as it was intended) instead of buying it for investment :)
