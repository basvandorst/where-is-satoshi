I've never quite understood this point. Does this mean that there are 2^256 possible private keys that map to 2^160 distinct public keys? If so I presume that there are a buttload of private keys for every public key and as long as you know one of the private keys you can move the coins associated with that address?

It's probably better to point noobs towards a deterministic wallet so they don't have to worry about limited key pools

Very cool, but I think there's a problem with the base58 encoding of the private key.
eg. Using 'test' as the passphrase i get L2ZOVMYTXXQVJMMTFQEMGVCB5YMIEDAPDWSVX6RQVUWIBGUNRIHZ as the base58 private key but on bitaddress i get L2ZovMyTxxQVJmMtfQemgVcB5YmiEDapDwsvX6RqvuWibgUNRiHz.
It appears to be just a capitalisation issue.

Have you considered having one more crack to win your money back?

So what options do we have to buy BTC with a half decent exchange rate?
I'm thinking international wire to bitstamp?

This is the first time I've actually thought about spending some of my coin

You'll get a bit over it once you get scammed or lose a bunch when an exchange disappears.

So we go from 2^256 possible private key values (ignoring the fact that some of these aren't valid) and hash to a 160 bit value or 2^160 possible addresses. 
Does this mean there are on average 2^256 / 2^160 = 2^96 possible private keys associated with every bitcoin address?

Do you really get your car confiscated if your caught drink driving? If so that's pretty fucked up.

Hmm they need to update that diagram and move the total value of all bitcoins from the millions section up into the billions

If you're looking to buy coins in Australia then I would recommend [coinjar]( Depositing funds is as simple as making a BPAY payment and they offer a good exchange rate.

This is a really clever engaging way to talk to people about the benefits of bitcoin without sending them to sleep. Well done mate.

But how do you get experience if you don't trade?? I think you're better off trading for a small amounts to build experience and you can move up from there if you are feeling confident.
I did exactly the same as you though at first, lost some coin but learnt a lot.
