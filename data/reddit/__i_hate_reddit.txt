This is seriously the best news ever.

I think that is an excellent bet and if I had fiat on Gox I would've done the same.

Lots of cool things are happening in DTLV...but **DTP and Tony are not helping one bit.**
Sorry if you've drank the DTP kool-aid but you'll see in time that it's a crock of shit. It's not a "community" effort, it's the misguided vision of one douche who wants to strip DTLV of everything unique that makes it Las Vegas (particularly gaming - see Gold Spike, Bunkhouse, Western) and turn it into a second-rate San Francisco. Of course, they're not even succeeding at that since my friends at Romotive decided to [opt for the real thing](
I used to be like you, all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and ready to build a "community." But the truth is, *they don't want you.* I know it's tough to see past the Hsieh-fellating circlejerk, but DTP/Zappos/Tony are not friends to you or the neighborhood.
You've done great work so far with The D and GG. Keep it up but stay away from the Cult of Tony.

What was the spread like when it was easy to cash out with Dwolla?
