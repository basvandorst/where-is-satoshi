He's just spewing buzzwords out of his ass. If Bitcoin is to be immutable, that means there would be no more software updates forever.

People with fiat aren't holding bags since they can buy anything with it. Not so with crypto, which can only be traded to fiat, other crypto, and limited products in some markets.

You don't optimize by increasing the complexity of the overall system and introducing more points of failure. The problem more ideological than technical.

The limitation is in the current infrastructure and not in the code itself. Regardless, Blockstream had already created the real solution to the scalability problem, side chains, which are subdivisions the bitcoin blockchain. The working example of this is the Liquid Network. Too bad they've patented and commercialized this.

USD is backed by the United States. Crypto is backed by bagholders.

Blockstream already did this with the Liquid network and they've patented the tech too. The Lightning Network is its retarded cousin.

Pure, unadulterated greed.

It's sinking down the toilet.

Only Blockstream is doing the LN implementation. Blockstream is a for-profit company. 


*Blockstream is a blockchain technology company co-founded by Adam Back, Gregory Maxwell, Austin Hill and others, and led by Adam Back and Gregory Maxwell. Blockstream is one of a number of institutions that provide funding for the development of* **Bitcoin Core**, *the predominant network client software.*


Bitcoin is heading towards centralization with its private chains because that's where the money is. Communistic/anarchistic ideals don't bring food to the table.

Why did you reply to that poster then? It's one thing to support Bitcoin and another thing to shit on other payment systems. It doesn't make sense to set other payment systems to higher standards than Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is not without its disadvantages. Hundreds of millions were lost during the Mt. Gox fiasco because the transactions that went to the thief's wallet couldn't be reversed.

How's that bad? This is a necessary precaution against fraudulent transactions.


Bitcoin isn't available in all countries either.

Blockstream is Core because Blockstream is founded by Core members.

Regardless of the semantics, the purpose is the same. Satoshi didn't use the word currency because it would've obviously given him legal trouble. It's illegal to make your own currency.

From the Bitcoin whitepaper:


Cash is another word for currency.
