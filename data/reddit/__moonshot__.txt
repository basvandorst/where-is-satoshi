The fees for a bitcoin transaction are based on that size of the data needed to store the transaction—you are in essence bidding on buying space in a block. The value of the transaction (how much bitcoin) is irrelevant. Fees are generally expressed in wallets in satoshis per byte.
Every additional input transaction (UTXO) that needs to be included in your transaction to express the transfer increases the space needed to store the transaction. That is why the fees are lower for transactions with one input and higher as you add more inputs.
If you did one sweeping transaction with many inputs, and then another transaction sending the result from that output to a new output, the second one is smaller (cheaper) because each transaction only stores the previous outputs it is directly using, not the entire previous history.

Correct. You can have one or many UTXOs at the same address, and the format of the transaction references the UTXOs.
Another thing many people don’t realize is that you cannot partially spend an input—it’s all or nothing, and your net transaction is made by spending the whole input and then sending a “change” transaction back to an address in your own wallet—which depending on how you do it or how the wallet is coded, can be sent back to the same address or sent to a newly generated address. Often by default it is the latter.
This is mostly transparent to users, but can be quite confusing for things like paper wallets—users may think of it like a preloaded debut card, and not understand why even a small purchase empties the entire balance (if there was only one UTXO), unless you tell the wallet to send the change back to the same address.

The main advantage of a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor is that the private keys are protected in a hardware security module (HSM) and never really leave that module, so that at least in theory, it would be very, very hard for anyone to get direct access to your private keys.
A software based wallet will typically encrypt your keys with a passphrase, but the wallet decrypts the keys when it signs transactions, and there is no hardware module “walling off” the decrypted keys from the rest of your computer at that point. With a hardware wallet, your transactions are sent to the HSM for signing, and the HSM only returns the signed transaction.
Does that help?

Happy holidays to you as well! Things will get better. This, too, shall pass.

I was approached like this as well, but as soon as they said “my crypto is stuck and I want to send it to you”, my immediate response was to block them. It was already obvious that whatever they had in mind, I wanted no part of.

I’m with you, as CTO of Phore Blockchain I’ve provided support to hundreds of users, but as soon as the scheme started it was (fortunately) rather obvious that he was up to no good.
Even if he was being truthful (obviously he wasn’t), I would want no part of helping someone circumvent exchange restrictions.

I did reverse the perspective in the first paragraph vs. the second, to make the point that your perspective of which currency is the base matters. If you considered BTC to be the base currency against which all others are compared, then every fiat currency is already hyperinflated relative to bitcoin.

Yes. Look up Civil Asset Forfeiture. Law enforcement gets to keep some or all of the proceeds of what they confiscate.

It would be a better analogy if you posted that you have $35,000 cash in a suitcase under your bed, or in a safe behind a painting in your study.
In the kinds of criminals at least, Bitcoin has the anonymity of cash.

Oh, OK. Carry on seizing assets at will then.
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:01:13
If I told you that a currency that was once worth many thousands of dollars was now worth $0.0002857, would you say that it had hyperinflated?
Now take the other perspective, with bitcoin as the base currency for comparison. Check the value of the USD against bitcoin. 1 USD is currently trading for 0.0002857 BTC.
Edit: Added context for clarity.

It’s worse than that in the US. You can simply be driving through Texas with $10,000 cash and the police can pull you over at a checkpoint with no probable cause, decide your cash must somehow be drug money with no evidence to back that up, and confiscate it. It’s then on you to prove your innocence to get it back. Otherwise the police department gets to keep and spend it.

Buy a car, for cash.
Buy a gun, for cash at a gun show.
Deposit your daily earnings from your food truck business.
Bring home your earnings from your legal medical marijuana dispensary that most banks will not let you deposit.
You’re into Scrooge McDuck cosplay.
Why is it your business what I do with my cash?
BTW, gift cards and almost anything else of value can and have also been taken. Even houses have been confiscated, when just one person living there (often not the primary owner) is suspected of a drug related crime.

What are you trying to accomplish?
If it’s a technical “can it be done” question then yes, you can broadcast one, but if your address has no BTC balance then it would be an invalid transaction and would be immediately rejected by every node you broadcast to. It would never appear in the mempool and most nodes would never see it.
Most wallets would not broadcast an invalid transaction at all, since it would validate and reject it internally first, but you could simply send a raw transaction crafted manually and if necessary remove any code that would validate it before broadcasting. Many bitcoin code libraries would allow you to do this even without a wallet.
If you instead meant to ask could you send a transaction for an address you don’t own yourself, then the answer is also yes. That same raw transaction could be created and signed by a wallet that did have a valid balance, and they could give you the signed, valid transaction (as a raw hex string, for example) which has not yet been broadcasted, and you could broadcast it from your wallet even though you don’t own the private key. This is essentially no different than what every bitcoin node does automatically when they receive valid broadcast transactions, but you would be initiating it yourself instead of receiving it from another node.
Are either of those matching your objective?

Hitting the jackpot in Vegas might actually have a paper trail. How about if you have a food truck business, but no paperwork with you to prove it? What if you’re on your way to buy a car for cash, or just sold something for cash?
The $10,000 is just an example, it could be just $1,500 or even a pack of Amazon gift cards rubber banded together in the back seat.

Realistic or not, the Constitutional protections against search and seizure without probable cause in the Fourth Amendment should very clearly prohibit this practice—yet the practice continues.
