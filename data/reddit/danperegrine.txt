This is a question better put to the Silk Road forum. 
Bitcoin is no more 'for' money laundering than the paper money in your pocket is (which is why many countries that issue money by fiat limit the legal size of cash transactions). 
Edit - followup: If the money is already in your bank account you quite simply cannot make it disappear without anyone knowing - because the bank would know.

International money transfer (although less so FX trading) is an obvious and well established use-case for Bitcoin. The core use, imo, is its ability to allow us to un-bank - or be our own banks, as it were. The massive value proposition of that cannot really be overstated.
Such transactions are also excellent teaching moments. Property sales are intensely trust-driven to the point where escrow is sometimes mandatory - and the whole POINT of escrow is that after a certain level of transaction size we find it necessary to remove trust from the equation. The introduction of colored coins and contracts/securities to the blockchain will likely enable us (ultimately) to conduct large scale transactions without any need for third parties at all.
As an aside to that, Bitcoin's low transfer fees and the ability that all parties are effectively acting as their own banks means that Bitcoin may well find itself as a medium of inter-bank transfer (as it is more secure than the current method) and escrow - although we will need to wait until well after we've done at least a few more years of price discovery and the volatility curve has flattened out a bit.
Buying pizza is novel and fun for the sake of history - you can spend half a bitcoin to buy something someone paid 10,000 bitcoin for just 3 years ago.
I generally argue that bitcoin is too young to be useful in retail trade except for the sake of novelty. It is still a currency but I think it's strongest value is in its transfer mechanism. The only areas of retail where it really makes sense at the moment such as illicit goods and gambling only actually make sense because of changeable laws.
Why would I spend bitcoin on a game of online poker when I could spend USD? Why would I spend bitcoin on pot when I could walk down to the corner and buy it legally? I don't do either of those things anyway, but the economic argument still holds.
Even so, there *is* something to be said for novelty. Personally I wish the manufacturers of ASICs had not set a USD price at all - and required people to buy in bitcoin - just like Casacius coins are priced. Perhaps they'll get there in the end - or perhaps they're waiting for price discovery just like I am.

In that case, while you're at it, how about doing trailing stops as well.
@_date: 2013-02-10 13:21:59
The first thing we'll see as ASICs come online is a much faster blocktime until we reach the difficulty recalc. Difficulty will relatively quickly adjust to match the larger network hash rate.
Prices will only express volatility if the miners dump the coins they earn, which there's no reason to expect them to do unless they paid USD for their rigs and maybe need to pay their credit card bills.
However the negative result OP is worried about with GPUs will still come to pass - not because bitcoins are worth less but because GPUs will no longer be able to capture a significant amount of shares in a pool - and would be basically useless without a pool - to generate any amount of return.
If it's just for fun, though - and if OP has free electricity from their school or whatever - then it's probably still fine - although I doubt their independent pool will complete a block outside of blind luck.
Instead of operating a 'pool', OP+friends might consider just operating a team on an established pool that is maintaining a sufficient hash rate to complete blocks. OP has already said that the computers being used are primarily personal / gaming rigs and not miners - so if the electricity costs are negated they'll probably at least generate something from shares from a larger pool.
They don't have any equipment costs really, as this isn't the primary use of the machines in the first place and is just something they can do instead of being idle.

First I'd want to define which growth number it is we're talking about. Risks to user adoption are pretty much inverse to risks to the growth of the exchange rate. Increased use will apply upward pressure on the exchange rate. Ironically, the lack of stability in that exchange rate is IMO one of the leading pressures against more widespread adoption (at least in terms of adoption of BTC as an instrument of trade). 
I think the adoption we are seeing right now is primarily a sort of commodity adoption - people are adopting it as an investment instrument. This will only self-reinforce for so long. 
To maintain decent exchange value over the long term, btc needs to become more useful in trade. It is already useful for some niche applications but it needs to be much easier to use and much more stable in exchange rate. At the moment it is not only hard to make transactions in btc it is financially foolish to do so (unless you believe the exchange rate will collapse).
It ultimately needs to be as easy to buy something denominated in USD from an account denominated in BTC as it currently is to make such a transaction from an account denominated in Euros. The BTC denominated hybrid Mastercard idea is a good start here. 
As I've said before, I am not looking for stability until after the next halving. I think, however, that bitcoin is useful and it has a minimum point to which it could collapse (short of protocol failure). And because of that it will always have the ability to recover and return to growth. 
The risks - to return to the issue at hand - are many, but I believe that the network is resilient enough to survive such risks even if they all came to pass. Some risks to certain growth pathways are even beneficial for others. Government regulation will hurt mass adoption, however it will not impact bitcoin as a useful mechanism for payments in the black market or in international money transfer. 
Hacking is a risk - however the network has survived such issues before and would likely recover more quickly in the future. 
The real risk is that the improvement of usability won't catch up to the usefulness of it as a speculative investment. If the network fails to expand sufficiently to support the usefulness at the price then there will be a correction. I anticipate a correction - although I'm not prepared to say that we have even reached the floor to which it might fall when the correction occurs.

It really depends on your setup for how long it takes the reference client to synch up - what you're doing is volunteering to become a node on the network (joint record keeper for the blockchain). Online wallets and some desktop wallets don't require you to do all of that. If you export the wallet file itself to another wallet client you will find that the funds you sent to it are already there.

I have to wonder if a stupid joke is worth that much to someone, or if the webmaster just set the initial price at a random value because they're a genius. 
The point is that at some point a joke isn't worth it anymore. This means that at some point nobody will buy it. This means that the idiot who bought it before that point lost their money. Logically it extends that this is true of EVERYONE who paid for it without sure knowledge of the value at which someone wouldn't. Therefore if your answer to OPvs question is 'yes' '...

"You might think that, I couldn't possibly comment."
Essentially, what I was getting at I suppose is that there are more variables in the equation. "Long Term" is typically &gt;1 year for any investment. When making an investment you need to consider your goals and your acceptable level of risk (nothing you can do with money, including doing nothing, is without risk).
There is, of course, a level below cost of mining that a miner would feel forced to sell at if it precipitated a complete loss of confidence in bitcoin in general.
There is the recoverable cost of the hardware itself, either when the next gen comes out and the manufacturer offers a trade-in value or via bitmit or ebay or another market. In fact I would not be at all surprised to see first-gen ASICs popping up on markets immediately after they ship (with an additional premium) to perform some arbitrage on the value generated by the limitation of available units. 
I couldn't possibly say that if your horizon is long enough a miner isn't a bad investment. I would say that I'm not all all convinced that it IS a bad investment, and if your risk tolerance is high (your willingness to lose much or all of what it costs to make the order) I have no reason to believe that the investment wouldn't ultimately have been worth it.
The only thing I CAN say is that if you believe in the long term growth in the BTCUSD spot price then you'd be foolish to pay BTC for the rig.

Netflix manages licensing restrictions via IP address, not whatever currency you're using to pay for it.

There are a lot of resources as to what Bitcoin is... although before you show them those you might want to look up ponzi scheme - because it should be impossible to mistake bitcoin for a ponzi scheme. 
A ponzi scheme is when I promise everyone a 5% return every week on their investment and John gives me $100 because John is an idiot. The next week I give him $5, and then I do it again the next week, and the next (I can keep this up for a while) - all the while telling him that his $100 investment is safe and sound even though actually i'm just paying him back with his own money...
John tells two friends, and they tell two friends, and they tell two friends - and so on - until I've got a shitton of cash. Obviously at this point if everyone asked for their investment back, I'd be screwed... this is why it's fraud. Sometimes more intentional than other times, but always fraud. A ponzi scheme is exactly this - it is a very specific thing, not just another word for 'financial fraud'... in the same way that 'murder' isn't just another word for 'crime'.
Bitcoin is not an investment offering. Nobody is promising you any return on your bitcoin investment - just as nobody promises you that you will get some sort of return on the dollar bills / euro bills / whatever are in your wallet - they are currencies, not securities.
Bitcoin DOES have the helpful feature of being secure, of known and limited quantity, as well as many many others better listed elsewhere on the sidebar that make it superior in many ways to those currencies that have the name of your country or continent on them... but just the same, it is a floating currency - meaning its value is only what people will accept it in exchange for.

The Federal Reserve has a target of 2% inflation - this means that the organization that is responsible for managing the USD monetary supply *wants* $1 to be worth 2% less every year than it was the year before. This is why financial networks almost always make a point to distinguish between *nominal* growth and *real* growth. If you invest $10,000 in US Treasury Bonds paying 2.036% per year (current coupon) then at the end of that first year you'll have $10,203 - but the purchasing power of that money after the year is over will be $10,003 when compared to the purchasing power of money at the time you bought the bond.
If you're talking about bonds with durations of less than 10 years... let's say 2 years... the current coupon is 0.27% per year... so your $10,000 investment will after 1 year will be *nominally* worth $10,026 but if you compare it to what you could have purchased when you bought the bond it would *really* be worth **$9,826** relatively.
That's inflation.

Don't sell? BTC is volatile which means it's decent for trading - however the better practice would be to spend when the value is high (buy things in btc) and increase your BTC in dips. 
I have orders sitting at 1cent increments from my average buy price down to nothing. These are my investment orders. If I want BTC to actually buy something I use market orders and pick it up at whatever the current price is while also purchasing an equal amount for my investment to reflect that I've accepted the current market value of BTC and pull up the average fiat cost of acquisition of my investment.

I think there's still some legitimate debate about the commodity vs currency models of Bitcoin. The question is not what it is meant for but what is it 'useful' as. Bitcoin is far too volatile at present to be very useful to a person being compensated for their work in Euros to risk taking on bitcoin-denominated debt (for example). Imagine if you were having a hard time getting a loan from a bank six months ago... Instead you got that loan in bitcoin under the assumption that you could use your salary to buy bitcoin and repay the loan.
If you had taken out a 20% APY loan from a P2P lender your 1-year loan for €5 000 would cost you €500 per month to repay in that 1-year.
If you had taken out a 10% APY loan denominated in Bitcoin six months ago (10 Aug 2012, BTCUSD: €9.25) for the same EUR nominal amount, you would have borrowed about 600 BTC (including the interest). Let us allow that you made all of your payments until now on time and only owe 300 BTC on that loan. The nominal value in EUR of half of your remaining loan is about €5200.
In the long run I hope/imagine that bitcoin will become more of what it is intended to be - a medium of exchange. That said, it is somewhat irrational given the current market to actually buy anything with it unless you believe that it is seriously overvalued at this point and that a steep fall is impending - in which case you're an idiot for waiting for the peak - you should get out now and take your profits.
Until Bitcoin prices have normalized - which I'm not sure will happen for a very long time indeed (at least until some time after the next halving) - and even if you *are* somehow being paid in bitcoin directly - the only reasonable thing to do in terms of 'spending' bitcoin is to buy items denominated in your local currency where prices are somewhat established and understood and cash out only the bitcoin you needed to make that transaction - buying anything that you COULD buy for fiat with bitcoin only indicates that you believe that you can get better value from the bitcoin (ie, that it is overvalued relative to fiat).

If you want quick money learn to trade the currency and make your money on the spread. If you actually want to invest there's probably never a bad time to invest in current-gen mining tech.
If you're not running a mining operation of sufficient size to find blocks yourself then join a pool (ASIC pools will probably have the same ultimate ROI as GPU/CPU pools do now, once the mining network has fully converted). The cost of entry is going up, however that cost is being incurred by every participant and will ultimately be reflected in the spot price.
If nobody mining bitcoins is willing to sell those coins for less than it cost them to mine, then that creates some support for bitcoin exchange rates.
In the real world an investment that produces revenues equal to the invested capital once every 10 years is considered cheap. There are a lot of risks associated with bitcoin investment, so its reasonable that we would discount those risks compared to traditional market investment - even so, to discount 90% off of what would already be considered a cheap investment seems to indicate to me that you have almost zero faith in the future value of bitcoin... in which case why are you considering investing at all?

It depends. At full adoption the deflation probably wouldn't be any worse than the mortgage interest you would pay in fiat - a lot of which is to compensate the lender for time value and inflation beside just profits (subtract ~2% per year from any current foxed rate loan to see the lender's real earnings) 
You also would need to incorporate deflation into any appreciation of alternative asset value. If bitcoin were stable and deflating at single digit percentages every year (let's say 5% for no reason at all) than the opportunity cost would impact a house that might have appreciated at 7% in the current climate so that no tangible appreciation were taking place (5% hypothetical btc deflation + 2% current USD inflation). 
Investment in a bitcoin only economy would look somewhat different than investment in the fiat economy does. People would need to develop (and would develop) a practical appreciation for the difference between nominal growth and real growth. 
So the answer to your question is that the market would adjust the terms of loans for homes to make sense and while there will always be a strong motivation to save versus borrow (rather than the reverse encouraged by the current fiat system) the purchase of large durable items will still require credit and the use of credit and the terms of credit will adjust to make sense. 
Of course you're here so if you're still alive when your hypothetical situation comes to pass you'll b among the wealthiest people in the world.

A 6 month ROI is a 2:1 annual return. You're asking for something that some have by luck achieved in half a year but that is 10x what anyone in history has ever been able to do on a regular basis (20% per year for 40 years makes you Warren Buffett). 
You're already too late (most likely) to make, a 1yr 100%ROI on any mining hardware. Why are you setting your sights so insanely high?

The fastest way to "get bitcoins" as you say is to buy them from someone else. 
Probably the best way to get bitcoins is to sell some sort of service or product for them - as this increases the currency's [velocity]( which in turn will increase its value and make the coins you were paid for your product or service worth even more.

If you're US based you'll have to have to get SEC registration as a market to do fiat to fiat trades. Current markets only work because they only allow you to buy and sell BTC which is legally no different than buying and selling SLL for fiat (ie it's legally just game money albeit with generally higher than usual capital gains). 
The CBOE will fight you tooth and nail over that. And they'll win. See the recent US ban on intrade, which is a "gambling website" that the cboe successfully argued was actually an options exchange (because it was, insofar as the cboe is also a casino). 
Realistically, what would be best (at least from my perspective) is if Interactive Brokers connected to/supported the BitFloor FIX gateway. I think we're still a ways away from that though.

quick question, long answer.
One possibility: Increased media exposure has created a '[tipping point]( It would make sense that media exposure would lead to google searches and increased public discussion and that such exposure and discussion would lead to higher adoption.
At this point / growth rate I'm personally theorizing that what we're seeing is not high-level adoption by some few people or rampant speculation - but low-level adoption by more people. People aren't selling BTC because its still going up and the masses are famous for buying on rises and selling on dips.
There are more ways to spend BTC as well - which increases usage and therefore demand. 
Finally I would *like* to imagine that more people are operating as though BTC were their primary denominator. This means that when they look at prices they are looking at the Bitcoin price (not its relative USD value) - and are therefore only converting to USD when they need to make payments in that currency and don't have enough in their bank account to cover it.
Alternatively, most people who have been acquiring bitcoins up until now are aware that the supply is limited and therefore that by not selling them they are affecting a lower supply. Price is primarily demand driven, however as a lot of new people are entering the economy there is no firm understanding in the minds of new users as to the relative or real value of a bitcoin - something the community itself continues to speculate wildly about. Price discovery is still going on - and always will be - however this is a particularly volatile time as uncertainties ranging from ASIC introduction to increased public adoption and increased usefulness in commercial transactions are all happening at once.
tl;dr: the market is growing

Admittedly I've never tried to use a card from an international bank to pay for Netflix - and I'm not all that interested in testing it out; however, provided that Netflix accepts the network the card was issued through, it would be bizarre if they built that level of restriction. It would require them parsing the card number and identifying the issuing bank, that bank's location, and so forth.
Moreover it would be useless - as anyone can get a US-issued pre-paid debit card without having violated any laws (US Laws at least) - so it would be an ineffective filter even if they did implement it.
So no, I don't know it for a *fact*, it is an assumption based on the relative complexity of attempting to filter against that sort of thing and the complete lack of efficacy if they tried. Using IPs is much simpler and addresses the nature of the contract (which I have to assume doesn't care where you're from - it just cares where you ARE).

I guess it really depends on your goals. Are you buying BTC to use - or as an investment -  or as a trading instrument? 
If you want to spend it there are some options that will get you best value at any given time - although realistically, given the exchange volume, mtgox is the real value of BTC in fiat. 
Everyone else will charge a premium against gox, because that's what they're using for their offer basis. The only reason NOT to gox would be if you were uncomfortable with the I'D requirements which you're not really trading enough to worry about anyway. 
You could always lose money and OTC trade on localbitcoins or something - but you've not indicated anonymity is your primary concern. If it is, pm me and we can arrange a very secure and secret transfer that will be entirely to my advantage

That's fair. I wrote that whole post in three different sessions of attention (at work).
It actually amazes me that there isn't MORE currency day-trading going on at the moment, given the price volatility. Turning gox sound on and letting it run in the background at home is one of my favorite ways to remind myself of this. The currency is often running with 1% swings on every trade - which would blow an FX traders mind - especially seeing as the general trend is upward. 
As the trend goes up hopefully we'll get corrections here and there as some people cash out to pay their mortgage or buy a house - this will add much needed liquidity to tighten the spreads a bit.

Flattr is a great start. I expect that once brokep realizes bitcoin will never have been his idea, and accepts that, he will incorporate it into Flattr.

If you can GET an asic it would probably pay for itself in a sub 1 year window. I don't know how long it would take, but I do know that if you set it up and run it for a week or two and decide it's taking too long you can always sell it for a very nice premium to your purchase price

A little A/B testing never hurt anyone. Why not try both (listing on your own website and on BitMit) and see? There are a number of merchant solutions out there including Coinbase, Bitpay - MtGox has their own payment processing system as well... 
The bitcoin economy is still (relatively) small and what's 'best' is far from well established.

TBC, I've just got home by way of the bar - so I'm not at top form. 
My read on the proposition is that you intend to offer elements that will offer a value prop over mtgox and the other extant markets. I look forward to it - although I'm on record as saying anyone who accepts or makes a loan denominated in btc is a moron with no respect for volatility.
As you're taking angel capital I assume its your intention to provide legal protection to that capital by registering with the SEC.
The protection Gox brings is the idea of single-currency access. They do not allow you (without gaming the system) to trade directly between government regulated currencies - additionally they are located outside of primary SEC jurisdiction in Japan.
I'd also advise you to be mighty careful about advertising investment offerings (this isn't quite my specific field, IANAL, etc) prior to SEC rulefinding on the JOBS Act - although if your AL team profiles are to be believed you should know that already.
If you believe in the Bitcoin model you might want to talk to me (or someone else) about an underwriting etc on MPex or another BTC based market - as a publicly listed exchange would probably drive a lot of interest.
I get the feeling, though, that what you're looking for is a us-registered bitcoin forex exchange. There is a high hurdle to jump on that, and I wish you the best of luck. I've bookmarked you on AL - but frankly I'm not yet convinced my money isn't safer in BTC.
