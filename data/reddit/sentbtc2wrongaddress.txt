At least I didn't have a serious investment in it. To me I'd be more torn from losing my savings on the stock market or being car jacked. Fortunately I don't see either of those two happening as I don't buy stock and I live in a "everyone carries" area. Myself included.
Would've been nice to retire at 18 lol.

From what I've read, every single transaction whether a gain or loss needs to be recorded. S&gt; 1BTC @ 13K for 1LTC @ 1K, is considered a loss, but still needs to be recorded for the amount of asset and the value of trade both ways.
From a passive day trader, this screws me. For a constant day trader, I'm so sorry.

To be honest I'm not entirely sure, I merely got close to the cap they had in place with trading and USD I had on my account via coin sales I purchased from coinbase and sent there. Sorry :|

FOMO right there.

I too learned the hard way. Nearly doubled my coin count on the two alts I was dabbling in, wound up getting stuck after a dozen trades and withdrawals just before what was going to be a btc rebuy.
BTC went down, both those alts went down.
Time for bed.

Don't know, I realized my mistake and quit caring. Couple months later checked and my wallet was still empty so. Guess it went to some lucky guy.

This is when alts will take a dip, and probably rebound harder. What happens in SK has no influence on me, my planned buys or sells or *hodl*.
The market as a whole will probably have an impact, but how much of the market is owned by SKs? 
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:31:49
I mean if you're dedicated.. A phase change cooler would do it. Either prop open a freezer on max cool or salvage the components out of one and run the hot side outside. Or an indoor air conditioner if you're boring with a dehumidifier.
See about planting bushes or small trees around the hot side prior, to hide its presence.

Just giving you a comparison, if you buy 450$ there's a fee so your initial value is already a tiny bit lower. If you sell immediately after, you'll get &lt;420. Coinbase, imo, is not a trade center it's for buying and selling the big four. For your holding purpose, it'll do fine but some may recommend a private wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:14:44
I guess the only thing stopping you is yourself.
Hurry up already and buy at the high, only real ballers do that.

I'd have just shy of 7mil at this current rate.
So less than that, I don't remember the exact amount I transfered either but it was over 300. And I'm over 20 now. 
Probably wouldn't retire either, I'm not a vacation all the time type or ever really. I like building things too much and seeing physical gain from construction, welding and automotive mechanics. Have a real kick ass, do it all shop and probably operate as a business.
Any financial gain I achieve now is split between savings and car projects, plus I'm married so who knows what I would've done with that much money so young.

If BTC is 15K on coinbase, you buy one coin at that and call it a night. Next day it's at 15k, then rolls into 15,300 and you go to sell it *will always be less or equal to the buy cost, not counting their transaction fees with buying and selling*.
Plan accordingly. That applies to all coins offered by CB. And yes CB does show the gain of a single coin for each of the big four. It will also show the current value of what you have in your wallets there.

Oil is also an option, takes more dedication though.. Since I don't think many people would buy an oil covered gpu if you sold later and it'd be a pain to replace. Otherwise, a nice aftermarket diy radiator (like oil cooler on a car or power steering) with a pump that can handle it would also work.

Does it matter if they made any innovative progress or benefit to the world at the end of the day? The grouch in me says yes, but that's because I didn't make any financial gain from what they did, do or will do for the time being. The realistic part in me says no, it doesn't matter. They made decisions and reap the benefits and gains. Unless they robbed an elderly couple of their millions or murdered children who had inheritance and claimed it themselves, oh well.
Some people win, some people lose. Would you prefer communism?

Buy more GPUs. Gonna mine with titan v's because I'm no pleb. Keep my day job, it's easy enough as it is - build a massive garage with three of every tool I've ever wanted from a CNC machine to a 3D printer with a bucket of 10mm sockets. Then make some stupid engine swap, because I'm not the vacation all the time and relax - type.

Coinbase supports transactions in Australia if I remember correctly.
I also remember Kraken having a 50k limit, USD, on my account. This cute little slider bar filled up scary fast when I went all in. Never maxed it though.
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:54:23
Are you claiming it as your asset? I would assume not as you wouldn't net any gain from it either.
I believe he would be taxed on the sale or profit gains of trading.

Sounds like economics and mathematics to me.
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:22:03
I don't believe it is stuck, it either is in your wallet, is being sent or is not in your wallet. Since it's there still it's likely sending and will either be confirmed or kicked back by the network. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 02:52:09
Guess you better sell and stay out of the crypto game for good. Better yet, just send it to my wallet so you don't have to write a gain down on taxes if you're us based.

Try ramping the case fans up to the most you can tolerate if its applicable. I don't run case fans over 80%, that's just me. There may be a reason someone has but I don't. I just like that as a number as I feel 100% constantly will shorten their lifespan.

It's your money guy, if you find it tempting then by all means. But take the past into consideration, like the 19k spike in December. May happen again soon, may happen later this year, may never go up again. No one definitely knows.
I wouldnt buy unless it came to 13k or close to it, but that's based off my analysis which involves beer.
Lots and lots of beer.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:25:12
That'd be a hard battle. But I would for sure.
They probably calculated a loss on their end automatically and had someone check it out. Based the order request off the rising trend and decided its too dicey.
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:52:34
Is the gpu pulling air from inside the case? If so flip it around. One less problem. Upgrade the intake and exhaust fans, you don't need 20$+ noctua fans but if they are what came with the case I'd bet they are underperforming.
Edit, have you sped the fans up in the bios?

This is also possible. Did you call and talk with them before doing that buy? Do you typically do things like that? USAA blocked my first one because it was detected as suspicious activity. Too bad it worked out I had tried to buy at peak for some coin that wasn't worth its wallet size.
