Fed wants to "improve" the U.S. Payment System and asks for users' opinion:

Your article just confirm what I said.. because the source of your article is the study of the Cornell University for which I posted the link (the pdf paper).. ;)

Bitcoin is not a decentralized monetary system anymore. In its protocol there is the seed to make this money worst then the actual fiat money released by central banking system. Can you imagine a future where this money will become mainstream because some central authority exploited this attack to get control over the network? Are you sure that every neutral bitcoin miner will renounce to have higher revenues because this will undermine the anarchical faith on this money? Maybe the majority of people buying and mining bitcoin right now are just interested in making profit rather than to have a decentralized monetary system, the price will continue to rise even if the faith in a decentralized authority will be compromised. The result will be a new monetary world order. Seems China already understood this.. we hope United States and Europe will understand this soon and will try to start the race for the control of bitcoin network. Anarcho libertarians are the true losers on this game.

Personally I think Vitalik has a quite twisted reasoning.. I found more clear and more easy to understand the original study from the Cornell University. (

I think your article is not a debunking, it's just a point of view.. Bitcoin is not a decentralized monetary system anymore. In its protocol there is the seed to make this money worst then the actual fiat money released by central banking system.

These people are mining at actual loss.. bu they hope tomorrow the bitcoin they earned will increase considerably in value to repay the investment and make a huge profit.. 
The fact that bitcoin is not anymore decentralized doesn't mean that it will lose value in future.. maybe it's the key to make governments accept it as a legal tender...

"There is also an intuitive flaw in their reasoning: Imagine there are 4 sets of miners, each with 25% of hashing power, all pursuing the "Selfish Mining" strategy."
I think that ciclically they could get the same revenues.. 
If hashing power is not equally distributed (real case) the pool with higher hashing power win the race all rational miners start to switch on that pool and Bitcoin become a centralized system.
Maybe governments will start a race to control the system, a "cryptowar" between USA, China, Europe and Russia...

I think the only solution is to modify the protocol in order to make miners not compete with each others in the discovery of new blocks but to create a global pool that cooperates by solving each block all together. Then everyone receives a compensation in proportion of its power computation.. This incentives the computational growth and makes pools useless... The system remains decentralized because there's no need for association... Obviously this is not a backward compatible implementation. This would require a new criptocurrency.. We could call it the ShareCoin. Who wants to get in?

Vitalik has the ability to take an understandable academic paper and make a blog article understandable only by autistic Tony... ;)

That's just the opinion of Vitalik Buterin on possible miners behavior... It is not supported by any kind of data.. It's not an evidence.
