The only way i could marry anyone is if she was wealthier than me and smart with the money. However it's almost impossible to find a wealthy woman with good personality and looks. It's hard to even find a woman who has good personality and isn't some kind of attention whore.

Getting married is gonna be the biggest mistake of your life. Why would you ever make such gamble with your property and future earnings, when it has no benefits to you? You don't need to sign any contract with a woman and the state to spend your life together with her. Trust me on this, you will thank me later in life.

Yeah that's not happening in most cases. There's literally no point to make contracts and involve the state in your relationship, it costs tons of money and if you have to involve lawyers to fight over divorce, it can drain all your money and mental health. Millions of men have been divorce raped like this.
If a woman is ever pressuring a man to get married and threatening to leave if he doesn't comply, then you know it's gonna end up in divorce. Marriage is a trap for beta males.

Most women earn less than men because they work less and have easier jobs that pay less. Stupid men who get pressured into a marriage deserve to get fucked. There's a reason why half of the marriages end in divorce.
It's even worse if you have kids, she doesn't work and you get divorced. Then you are sentenced to pay her support for the rest of your life on top of losing your kids and half of your shit.

There's not gonna be a ride back up, this bubble is already insane.

Sure it can go over 10k but i'm not taking any chances. At that point (10k) i would take my last coins out and wait for the crash.

This big boom is not gonna last long, there's going to be a crash in near future. Then i can buy some more.

My friends called me an idiot and laughed when i decided to hold and buy more after it went over $1000 for the first time. After it went back down to $300 i bought even more. 
Guess what, they aren't laughing anymore. I'm now getting rid of 80% of my BTC and investing on something more stable. Gonna be holding ETH and Verge for a while, let's see if they catch up.
