I consider this just vandalism as long as there isn't any information. This way, the press will read it, think it's official and then everyone here whines again how bad the media coverage is. (A Wikipedia-admin also seems to have reverted the edit.)

Take a look at flattr.

Hey, I even wrote 'freaking', that's more than polite for reddit :)

This is standard behavior: the account is frozen throughout the case, at the end it will be decided what happens to the money.

Haha, I found the same bug and was planning on reporting it after trying to really get a code - didn't work :) They seem to be pretty cool

That entirely depends on the outcome of the whole thing. It happens pretty often that the accounts will just be 'reactivated'.

CarrierIQ was removed with iOS 5 for the iPhone... Also: that attack vector is fairly small, I'd be more scared or stuff from the Play Store on Android (apps can update themselves and get evil etc)

It was sent from support I sent him an answer  but no reaction yet either. Maybe post about your problem too? This post didn't get a lot of attention.

It seems like a lot of details are missing on the technical side. Even if it seems simple, there are quite some problems that you don't solve (Your DDoS protection, for example, is not really explained.. IRC has some other problems which can lead to partial takeover etc. and is really not a good choice for this kind of stuff.)

You are using floats when working with money. Don't.
    return self.amount * float(prices[str(self.priceClass)])    
Edit: Oh, additionally, your  runs in debug mode... Bad idea.

There were some other complaints today today... One guy said that the bank account of the limited as converted into a private account at Commerzbank Bremen (Germany)... They even found the runtastic profile of the owner... At least it appears to be shady.
(Related: They also seem to have no idea about IT security)

Could you explain why? What were you hoping for/how did you get those expectations?
