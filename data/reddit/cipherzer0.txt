I concur with this initiative :)

Thanks! Me too :) Good thing here is I don't even have to pay anything extra for it. The dynamic public IP is just a service they offer their customers on-demand. Couldn't find any info on their website about this either. I'm glad they do offer it though :)

more subtle shit post...

Yeah, that was one of my thoughts why my initial setup didn't work also... ISP blocking and messing with certain traffic. Although I think the one I'm with is actually pretty nice. 
You could also try just changing the port from the default 8333. I doubt they do L7 packet inspection to rate-limit customer traffic. Probably more likely they limit some "infamous" ports.

for the amount of value you'll be protecting by the hw wallet, $20 in shipping is practically nothing...

Hmm interesting, but where's Binance on this list?
@_date: 2019-12-04 21:58:06
Awesome! Much appreciated. Will try this! :) thanks!

Yep, kind of normal practice to hide all behind a PAT today I think.

Moon? oops instructions unclear, I went out of orbit and off course, currently plotting course to Mercury, damn... let me see if I can turn this thing around for the Moon party ����

I've seen that one, but thanks! Doesn't really say anything about a typical recommended enhanced config though... then again, maybe bitcoind is good as it is out-of-the-box :)

In the Blockfolio phone app you can set two types of price triggers.
Target price (notify at fixed price) and Price change (notify if price change X % within Y time).
TabTrader also has a fixed price alerter for if the price reach a predefined level.

I have two ledger nano s and just ordered a KeepKey and Nano X during Black Friday discount. I use one device (same seed) as backup and firmware upgrade test and store it in a separate physical location. Would recommend others to do the same.

This is a 24/7 node too (or at least I aim for it to be).
Set up a monit process to monitor the bitcoind process etc and restart it if it goes down.
Probably won't happen, but better be on the safe side.
If anyone has a good systemd config I'd be glad to check it out as I didn't get my restrictive config to work and then didn't bother to try more.

haha, damn. sorry to hear... no option to change? have my upvote at least. some fake Internet points to cheer you up!

It actually took a few days.. like a week?
Was on rpi4, 4GB RAM and a spare 3.5" SATA disk i just put in an external case. More or less default settings for bitcoind. After a while I read that in order to speed up the initial download process I could raise dbcache, so I set it to 2048 MB. 
Could've probably used my laptop with SSD to download the whole chain faster and then just copied it over to the external SATA drive. 
I also noticed that the early blocks took less CPU time to process and went quite slow, while the later ones got the temperature up to 50-60°C (before it was steady at ~40°C) and went faster towards the end. Is this a correct observation? Possibly due to code changes, validating more blocks at the same time, SegWit or other things?
