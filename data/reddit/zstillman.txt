Well it is fucking ridiculous that i am still trying to verify my account unsuccessfully over and over again 4 hours later.  
If i were able to do small transactions with an unverified account it would be great, but nope!  You can't make transactions unless your account is verified and... oh wait, you CAN'T verify accounts.  hm this seems kind of fucked right?

Oh well this would be easy enough were it fucking possible.

Everytime i try to verify the account that i was finally able to successfully create after like 40 tries, it tells me it is unable to verify my identity when i press the quiz button.  Over and over again.

I understand that it was just launched today and there will be a few kinks and bugs in the process.  However, when you have a whole sizable portion of the website which is not functioning and is probably one of the biggest uses of the site, then maybe it is a sign that it was not time just yet to release the product to the customer.
