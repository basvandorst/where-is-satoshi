Not really, you had to do your due diligence to see which proxy (exchange, wallet, whatever) service will be giving the forked coin.   I studied the basics of law, not a lawyer btw. I believe coinbase did state it was not giving forked coins initially and was going to keep them, that should've been your warning to move to another service, if a service did state you will get it, and failed to do so, you might've been in a better spot for a judgement but that in no way guarantees any sort of payment. Any lawyer can win a case, only the good ones know how to collect. Good luck!

Not even the middle class Joe can do that LOL. But, online contract mining or just simply buying and holding, do sidejobs for whatever your profession is and accept BTC as payment, or just take the fiat and buy BTC with it. There's tons of ways, mining is just one. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:33:06
I thought about it but I'm too young, don't wanna just sit here doing nothing lol.

Well, one private person does not own a trillion dollars, we will see it within 5 years with BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:18:30
It donned on me a few weeks ago, Bitcoin will be the vehicle to create the world's first trillionaire.

I always think like that, when I got my first mining payouts I thought, well that's it, going to 0 in 5 min.

@_date: 2017-11-09 01:47:04
Where I'm at we have BTC ATMs where you can QR code your BTC into the machine and it spits out fiat, albeit less that market price.

Ah, well I did want the Elio, but those dreams are long gone, I lost faith in that company years ago. I could trade my Mustang in for a GT500.

They buy a thousand dollar phone with financing cause they're ain't no fiat for it! LOL
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:02:57
Lol, downloading music and smoking pot is also illegal. yet it's being done by millions of people as I post this comment. Even if gov't wanted to affect liquidity in the BTC market they need to either buy every single BTC in existence and hodl them forever. Or simply make it illegal to trade them for fiat. If they do the latter, then you just trade for something else, then exchange what you purchased (be it gold, silver, copper, comic books, used celebrity napkins, whatever) to USD or whatever fiat you want lol. Gov't and the private citizen is like watching a Tom and Jerry episode, it's a cat and mouse game.

Why not install one with a buy AND sell option? People don't like buy only ones. Athena ones in Miami had my business til they removed the sell option. Now I use one up in west palm to sell to.

There would be tons of articles to support a 60% drop and a jump back up. There's unimaginable amounts of money just waiting to jump in. My friends brother works at a Forex firm in Canada, all they do is talk about BTC.

Block blockers. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:03:01
Yeah ATMs buy about 20% below market rate and sell over market value. Also, I have a two way rule, I only use the ones with the buy/sell option. I don't use the buy only ones as it gives off a bad impression of BTC IMO. A customer should have more choices than to just feed a machine paper money. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:12:08

I had an old boss that his brother worked for a IT firm as some "analyst" company went public, he had about 30 mil in stock, went under and couldn't sell. He now runs fiber optic wire.... :-\

His audience probably believes a bitcoin goes into a VCR. Beck's target demo is the older folks, an older population does have more money than their younger counterparts but not as tech savvy as us. I believe if they go online and look up how to bitcoin, they will be inundated with tons of info and just quit. If someone can make a (jitterbug) type BTC interface then it would be viable. (Don't ask me how I know these things, I just do.)

just watching the ticks go up and down, in slow motion, heart beating loudly (like the movies) til it was time. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:09:27
well my idea was a bit simple as I know nothing about this lol. But it would start off with a cut from Fly Me To The Moon by Sinatra.   Then have this little dude animated, getting ready, as the music playing you see the price slowly climb up from 6 cents til now (it will be a 30 second ad) then cut the verse to the bridge where the orchestra comes in. Bitcoin rocket dude takes off the charts, past price indicators. Just him flying towards the moon with the last few seconds of video the words Buy Bitcoin come out. I can think it, I can't apply it. LOL!
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:33:00
I'm not greedy, on estimate. is buying just 1 btc and holding good enough? and til when?

Bitcoin will get to a point where a coke at the gas station will be 1 Satoshi, cigs, 8 satoshi, so on and so forth and those will be the people GETTING into it in about 15 years. Cheers!

5 to 10 years would be my estimate and that all depends on the actual adaptability of society. The more that get on board faster, then the faster we get there. "Price" stabilization would happen waayyy after that. There wouldn't be a need to refer back to fiat currency to know the value of what you have. But yeah, end game would be 1 Satoshi = 1 USD 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:34:45
Oh McAfee, I hope he's right. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:59:43
Even if the market dipped by say.... 60% Do you know the amount of fiat just sitting on the sidelines waiting to be thrown into BTC? The dip would be short lived and the buyers would be delighted. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:14:04
I wouldn't be surprised. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:19:29
These people and their shitcoins, you will probably see another fork and they'll call it Bitcoin Original. or some BS to try and steal more hype.

@_date: 2017-11-09 01:28:46
Even if we replicate the gains of 2017 in 2018, it STILL would put BTC @ 80kish this time next year, scary yet?
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:55:29
I was gonna buy 1 Roman style chariot and 2 Teslas to pull it. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:12:34
If BTC behaves the exact same way (in terms of gains) in 2018 as it did in 2017 I can take a few years off and chill, I'm only 31. Kinda scary lol.
