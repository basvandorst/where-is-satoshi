Literally the first time I've ever posed this question. Sorry ...

Good call. Again, it's all speculative and no one can really tell what's going to happen unless they're directly involved in a major shorting of it. With the amount of money floating around and the volatility of the market these days that occurs with no real relation to the success of a company, "investing" might not necessarily be the best term to use. It's more like one big gambling casino. Thanks though, I appreciate your insight. Guess we'll see what happens this weekend. I might just throw $100 at it for the heck of it and see what direction the value moves before getting serious.

Haha you're right, it's sort of a foolish question. I guess the basis of it was "Are there any obvious signs that this thing has hit it's threshold value and is going to collapse in the upcoming months?" Again, that would require a crystal ball. The best answer is probably "invest what you feel comfortable investing and let it ride."

Aye, I feel like such a fool for not taking the initiative back when it was sitting at $200/coin after the $1200 highs. It's a long term investment, just thinking if it's long term that we're due for a substantial crash in the upcoming months/years that would lead to even larger gains if you have the capital to pick up the pieces. Thanks for the reassurance though, I've heard similar speculation.

Haha ok my bad for flooding the forums with redundant questions. Next time I will just scroll. Have a lovely weekend! :D

True, just seeing what happens tomorrow and will be aggressively monitoring GDAX with funds in the account ready to jump in if it dips. Saw it at $15k today but was in the middle of something. Makes me wonder if Ethereum or Lite will reach the $15k mark in a year or two. It's all speculative but the currency is so versatile.

Travel. If I was intelligent enough to have jumped in when it was worthwhile and had enough to retire at my current age (29) I'd be investing in dividend paying stocks to make a decent return and then travel.

Haha well yeah the second best time probably would have been a few months prior to now like August but it was a tough sell then. Sucks being incredibly risk adverse with the cards we've been dealt these days. I've always been a saver not a spender ;). Thanks for the advice!

It's very hard to say but based on what I've read it's very much unlikely that the cost of BTC will tank substantially or skyrocket over the weekend. The best advice is to never over-leverage yourself to the point where your normal day-to-day life is going to be so negatively impacted that you're dreading the possibility of that ... unless you're perfectly alright with facing that reality head on if shit seriously hits the fan. It would be like investing your savings in lottery tickets with the expectations that you will win big. Invest what you can afford.

Thanks for the reassuring response, it did dip again this morning actually down to as low as $14.5k. Speculative betting, always a tough one unless you're comfortable with losing what you bet.

If you believe that I'll take this completely verbatim and invest based solely on their responses then you're sorely mistaken. I was just curious on what other people's opinions were and was using it to further my interest in educating myself on the subject. Believe me, I'm incredibly risk adverse, the last thing I'll do is invest solely because I'm told to. With that said, you have to take risks either way when investing in speculative shit.
