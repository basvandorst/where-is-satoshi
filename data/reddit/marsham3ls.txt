Please call them 'other cryptos' and not alts or alr coins. Thank you. ��
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:41:59
People won't get confused at all. BTC was/ is / remain bitcoin. The rest is an alt.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:22:59
Wow 1 downvote already lol
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:39:30
Because if there is a lot of talk of btc 'crashing', a lot of people will dump, the price will tank,... rinse and repeat. All, so they can buy in more for less.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:22:58
So,... n00bz huh? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:16:15
Ik heb geexperimentreed met daytrading. Winst gemaakt, maar dat is niet te combineren met een zoontje van 3 waar ik voor zorg als huisvader ��
Dus slim inzetten en hodlen maar. Hoofdzakelijk in btc, mco, xrp, maidsafe, neo en omg. Maar ik ga wel een aantal tokens weer verkopen als dez in de plus staan voor mij. Btc, mco, maid en xrp niet, die hou ik voor lange tijd vast.

Seriously,  I had exactly the same thought!

A breather, people trying to make some sense of the strong bull run and taking stock.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:15:38
Trading on an exchange is somthing else then sending btc on the blockchain though... so that doesn't add up...

Ah, come on man. Have the hope! You can say it's probably not likely.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:04:51
To me the patern trend seems obvious. Almost looks like someone or something is controling the btc market. Lol
Just curious, are you Dutch?
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:20:00
Zeker. Mij manier van handelen is minder lucratief. Actief handelen in de crypto markt geeft een beter resultaat dan passief handelen. Echter, beleg ik niet al mijn cryptos voor 'lange' termijn. Alleen BTC. De term "lang termijn" is ook niet juist gekozen door mij. "Oportunistisch handelen" is een betere omschrijving.
Wanneer een crypto (excl. BTC) voor mij een bepaalde winst verhouding heeft verkoop ik deze. Hierna kijk of ik de posities van mijn andere cryptos moet versterken. Dit doe ik aan de hand van nieuws en trend analyse. Wanneer er te weinig lositieve signalen zijn houd ik de BTC.
Ik realiseer mij dat ik winst laat liggen. Temeer, ik het patroon van de BTC USD koersverloop (waar ik eerder over schreef) lange tijd herken en volg. Een eigen onderneming (part time), een zoontje om voor te zorgen en het huishouden ook nog doen vergt veel tijd en energie. And there's only so much of it to get stuff done in a day...
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:04:20
No, same shit when shitty bch came to play.
Btc has a serious issue that needs to be addressed though, that is it's scalability. Work is in progress though. Hang on to you btc. Wait don't be tempeted to add to this attack.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:16:53
No problem. Sometimes these messages are also a good thought experiment for myself. And it reaffirms my 'believe / expectations' in BTC.
You know what? I think your percentage will be pretty accurate, but one can only speculate, right? ��
PS: you got to love the downvoters here on reddit...
It never stops amazing me why posts like mine are downvoted. Just my opinion, trying to be helpfull and answering a question to the best of my ability...
Edit: added the PS, because it really bugs me
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:24:26
That is exactly what I see / saw too. As for the 'controling'; one can only guess and speculate.
Funny that a lot of people in crypto are so 'macro' blind. They seem to live in the 30 min or 1h charts.
Yup, and if it is your real name then we have that in common ��
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:01:03
Really? Perhaps you need to google what the .com is. It's an abbreviation of.
Please let me know if you figured it out.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:20:43
No news. Point taken. In the coming week, when the coordinated attack has failed, the number of tx in mempool will be way way lower... 
Edit: small correction and addition
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:02:53
Well, 1 btc has the same value as all other btc. So, the current value is the value of all btc. Doesn't matter what price someone paid.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:44:42
The Fork is spooning your knive.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:23:09
BTC is more then just a crypto. It's a base, a standard, a value that has been gaining in popularity, stored value, trust and recognition the world over. All the forks are just distractions an trying to high jack from BTC.
A lot of 'normies' have some BTC. As a whole they hold a decent amount. A lot of these people have no knowledge of forks, and if they do they don't know what implications each fork bring with it. Let alone what they stand for, or why (if so) they would better. Thus they will more then likely stick to old faithfull: BTC. 
It has been around the block more than a couple of times and has survived any attack this far, and is likely to survive future attack far better than any other crypto. Let alone te shear volume of money that is in it.. Institution investor are getting in. Mass adoption is on BTC's doorstep. Buy and hold

@_date: 2018-02-16 12:42:35
I think your best chances are with Monaco atm. Beta of the app is being launched very soon (probably next week) with cards soon to follow. Launch would not be far off. Presuming UK wil be seen as EU you could see your card pretty soon. 
But others are doing their best to (re)launch asap... like TenX
Nobody knows who will be first and will succeed in launching a good card. My bet is on Monaco. Disclaimer: I hold a fair amount of MCO.
Ans as always: DYOR ��

I have to say, that after the long read, I can see you have put a great deal of research, time, energy and thought in to this extensive article. The read was pleasantly readable, easy on the eyes and brain. You stayed away from most of the jargon which in my book is a huge plus.
The only thing that nags me is your title. It's too tendencious. Make it lighter and less fearfull. Just my two cents.
Keep researching and writing.
Upvote please ��

Yup, I am, but also on the beta list �� I can't wait to get the full app and card. 
My advice to you is that if you can aford the lockup then go for it. It costs you nothing and could provide yoy with a good card and app. If it's not to toyr liking the sell the tokens when they release from lock up. No harm no foul ��

@_date: 2017-09-16 17:30:16
I see a patern of big dips (or crashes if you like). They seem to be happening every 2 months (give or take a day or two). But the general curve trends stay the same only it's getting more extreme, thus appearing more elongated as a new cycle is happening. Check back from sept. 16th.. you'll likely see what I'm talking about. 
So my guess based on my interpertation is that we'll see a new ath at 5-10 november reaching up to around $7000. But that is just my 'hunch' based on alot of speculation. I'm not an analist nor do I work in the financial sector. So please take this with a metric ton of salt���� I just found it interesting enough to share it wit you...
@_date: 2017-10-12 07:14:25
It's bull. He REALLY doesn't grasp, understand (or a lack there of) the whole crypto / blockchain tech.
Also all his eggs are in gold. If he was starting to warm up to cryptos, his customers are prone to reconsider their positions in gold. And gold price would spiral downward as demand pressure lowers. If you know what I mean.

It's best, in my experience, to look at previous trends. Up to now the course of thw btc usd pair, have been pretty consistent. Lile I said it isn't a precise perdiction tool, but in general there is a lot to gain in knowledge from previous trends, movements and forms of the graph.
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:47:36

And what currency is that? USD is decoupled from the gold value since 1972... And look where they are now... 
As far as I know there a no big or influencial fiat currencies that are 'backed' by something tangible.
All to control money flows and keep the stagnant or losing  economy under cover by making more and devaluating their own currency. This is what's been going on for far to long all over the world. I could write books full to back my statement. Heck, you can read tons of books written by more clever and influencial people. The days of these practices of cat and mouse games between the banks, central banks and governments will hopfully - with the mass adoption of crypto / blockchain - come to an end. Cut out the middleman! Take your own money. Store and manage it ourselves.
Two more cents. Lol

@_date: 2017-10-12 07:39:26
Well, in my opinion - based on my crypto experience - a 'small' ammount of btc doesn't cut the mustard tbh. Btc is the main 'currency' of the crypto sphere. Thus it safe to assume that it's value keeps on rising up to mass adoption and acceptance. So 'if' you are serious about investing (prefferably financialy and ideologicaly) I would at least buy 0.5 - 1 btc. Leave it there if you are unsure about altcoins.
You see it's all about scaling. Btc will be arround for a long, long time. This is just tbe start. The 'hord' of people is still to join in.
Make of my advice what you will. Just my two cents.
