Using basic Fibonacci levels I disagree with you. Here is a [Chart]( Very rare for the 62% to not be tested. We are currently consolidating at the 50%.
Edit: I chose that level to begin with because that's the last place we held prior to the enormous rally. You can start lower if you want but I'm looking at shorter term levels.

Then you are not using it correctly. No offense taken. But i strongly disagree. 
You may want to look into harmonics.
Edit: I have seen 1,000s of setups work over the last 6 years. Now that I think about it your opinion is wrong plain and simple and it is evident your not a trader.

Thank You. It actually came down to my 62% level. Not unusual to push a bit further.   I know people are generally skeptical of Technical Analysis on Reddit but its completely unfounded. Bottom line: Bitcoin has caught the attention of Wall Street and hence price action will be significantly more technical. User/btchombre thought we would not drop below $450 but using a sensible scaling strategy we came very close. I believe the low was 452.73- but keep in mind the 62% is never tested just once. So lets say you trade 1-10 shares of bitcoin you would go long 1-2 contracts at the 62% and have more 40-50 points below that point to cost average. Turns into a very nice trade.
I'm a crude oil futures trader- same rules apply here. I know the way big money traders think. Bitcoin will easily surpass $2,000 without a doubt. Now that we have seen how high it can go we will continuously test this until we see real sellers come into play.  We need to push significantly higher and consolidate. Then and only then can we see a genuine rejection of upside levels. I see this type of stuff in crude and other futures all day. Unfortunately I have no money invested in it at the moment because my firms algo is far too good to take my money out of to divest in BTC/USD. Regardless if it went to $5000 i would still make more money with the funds algo. 
It is actually not possible that we don't test $1,000. It is not a matter of if but rather when.
