Apps for instant crypto trading will cause millions to decline in their mental health

Bitcoin has gone bust on all its early ideological promises.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:57:33
We have already seen it. Bitcoin price dropped over 30% in a few weeks. Resembles what we’re witnessing now. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:28:59
Being honest to yourself is the first step to improvement.

I hope most of those 200k investors will be fresh investors and not one's already invested. As it'll be nice to have some fresh blood thrown into the ring and cause a stir under all the current BTC sellers.

I'm kicking myself for not buying bitcoins when thy were $200 each.
And $800 each.
And $2,000 each....

Lol even the mock up screenshots showing btc prices taking a dive. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:35:09
Came for Bitcoin, stayed for the drama.

Soon you will find it in 300 range. Need regulation. Companies are changing their name to block chain and skyrocket

I feel like this is so important and not enough people in crypto realize this. The real enemy is the banks and the more we stick together, the better chance we have of freeing ourselves from the current financial system.
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:47:52
Lies, lies and lies. It seems also that the media and Blockstream are now friends so they can ruin BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:36:19
Can anybody confirm this? This seems to be the only publication mentioning it. Find it hard to believe that this wouldn't be bigger news
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:32:27
I'm looking forward to testing it myself on working btc chain. Until then I just wait.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:44:32
TL;DR - Reddit is the biggest threat to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:33:07
Why did I buy in on this? "Bitcoin Jesus?" I'm selling this shitcoin the second it sniffs a satoshi in the green for me. Might just take a loss and move on to better projects.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:10:31
Well, it might. We are moving outside the realm of crypto kiddies and into the realm of big investors. Do you think they would like to have a fragile scam coin like bch to hold their billions? I don't think so
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:33:48
Uh pretty sure you're only supposed to be thinking about aliens right now. Thanks. -the government

Coretards, we ride!
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:33:49
Oh boy. This is going to send the already-moon BTC to a moon in another galaxy.
This is also a very strong case to put a good portion of your portfolio in BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:35:22
There's helluva BTC exchanges: poloniex, bittrex, bitfinex, kraken etc
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:13:23
Crypto will never replace precious metals. Nothing will. Because Crypto is man made precious metals are not.﻿

You should feel like something is watching you! LAMBO!

It is like the Monkey''s story and all those foolish guys who have invested are going to repent 
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:56:09
God please do not introduce yet another shitcoin money grab.
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:15:08
So it seems any country with a declining currency and sanctions against them is going to be getting into crypto.
