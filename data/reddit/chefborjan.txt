Thanks for all the suggestions, but I am definitely keeping my iPhone. The benefits of staying within the ecosystem far outweighs the current annoyance of not begin able to have a Bitcoin app.
If/when Bitcoin takes off and matures, as well as importantly the legal issues/worries are sorted out, I'm confident Apple will allow the apps. Until then they are covering their own backs, and the backs of their users by blocking things.
Also, I should clarify, whilst I am more than capable of jailbreaking, I'm looking for solutions to suggest to friends and family.

Thanks, this is the kind of info I'm looking for, I'll check it out.
EDIT: Looks great, nice and simple. I'll give it a shot I think.
@_date: 2014-01-15 11:20:06
Thanks, looking for options that don't involve jailbreaking though.

Thank you! Edit complete... Let's hope the bot still picks it up!

I admit I finally took a proper look at Bitcoin because of the recent bubble and crash, but all I can think about now is trying to set up some kind of online business using Bitcoin. 
I'm not going to lie I want to obviously make a bit of money, but its more to do with the fact I can easily access a global consumer base... the problem is I don't know what to sell haha!

Unfortunately, whilst you are probably doing everything correctly,  currently mining Bitcoin with your CPU isn't worthwhile.
It is been like this for some time now, due to the fact that mining has become increasingly difficult over time. Had you done this a few years ago, you would be okay, but right now you are competing again a vast array of computational power and hence your laptop will be using up more in electricity costs that it will ever mine in bitcoins. 
Best bet is just to buy BTC, and store them in your (properly secured) wallet.

Actually, they do now have live internet access. It used to be that astronauts could request certain websites to be cached and uploaded to be view 'offline' up on the station. They do still have that remote desktop system as well, but these days I believe the bandwidth has improved so that they can have their own personal devices to access the web with. Its not going to be crazy fast of course, since they have to dedicate a lot of bandwith to more critical information. Might make downloading the blockchain a problem!
Oh and hilariously, the ISS has a direct line number. Literally, you could call them from anywhere if you knew it, but obviously they don't give that out.

Well, I'm not talking about 90% off and thus making a loss, more like 20%. Enough to make the consumers think that your business is the place to go to. With sales volumes up you could afford to have smaller profit margins...

Haha well played.

You might want to restrict it to people who are somewhat local to you, it would be a bit aggravating if a few players had extremely high ping.

Local as in your local wallet stored on your computer? In that case, I'm pretty sure all the clients will give you this information. For example, I just right click on a transaction using bitcoin QT and I get much more detailed information.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:27:16
Can you give examples of them banning bitcoin wallets?
Anyway, I agree. Mobile wallets and bitcoin have to work. Since a large number of users are on iPhones, this will eventually happen once bitcoin gets big enough, so I'm not sweating about it.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:24:00
Thanks, I'll look into it more.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:25:28
Interesting, not too much information seems to be given though... I'm hoping that as much as possible the transactions/trust to all be handled client side in the game rather than pushed out to servers. As mentioned above, all they should really be doing is determining the results of the game.
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:27:22
Also, it may take some time for your wallet to synchronise from a fresh install. Don't worry this is normal.
While we are at hit, since you are new to it all, here have some BTC to get you started.

Don't worry about tipping, but just wanted to say I thought to myself that I really hope that those who do well from believing in bitcoin early make sure others benefit as well.
So well done to you!
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:32:03
I've also got a more important question.. Have they blocked your wallet software from connecting to the network? That would be something else..
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:06:03
Here is something to incentivise you... time to get yourself a wallet! ;)

I don't even need this right now... but seems so cheap that I should just get it anyway haha.
@_date: 2013-05-30 12:10:41
Look up your transaction here. You should have a transaction ID from when you sent the BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-23 07:03:34
I hope I still can get some! 
The interface in general is extremely clean, so thats a definite plus. Looking forward to it!
@_date: 2013-05-13 15:57:47
Yes, I mean access through the web. 
But its more than that, because technically you can obviously do this now. Anything you can do with fiat now, you can do with bitcoins, at least for what I'm talking about. But bitcoins allow things to be greatly simplified, no currency exchange or middle parties for example. Of course, consumers aren't too concerned about fees for such transfers, more about ease of use and low prices. 
Also, if you have great faith in BTC you could offer substantial discounts to those that pay in BTC with the knowledge you'll make those discounts back and more when BTC rises in value.
I don't think the economy needs to really grow much more than it already has for it to be viable, you just need the right idea. Thats the million bitcoin question though of course.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:27:21
Interesting.. I hope this blows up very negatively and publicly for them.
No idea why they would do this. Where is the pressure coming from?

Here's my address
I'd love to tell you my alias but I can't find it on my page anymore!

Thanks for the ideas guys.. any more out there?
