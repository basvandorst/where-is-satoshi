The security is simply different. Casper, for example, might avoid frequent single small reorganizations, but instead it might encourage rare reorganizations of a huge number of blocks and block histories.

The way LN is currently designed, if the keys are exposed all of the money can still be stolen. The attacker simply creates a channel with the exchange, and then, using the exchange's key, the attacker forces the exchange to create and broadcast an "old" tx. Then, the attacker steals all the money in the channel.
The LN txns are normal Bitcoin txns and are not inherently more secure in any way.
Since key = control (as always), attacker can sell key to everyone else with an account at the exchange. These individuals can use the key to rob the exchange, and the exchange can't stop them. In fact, attacker can even put normal users in a "steal or be stolen from" situation. So that they have no choice but to "steal".
So in many ways it is worse. And it requires the exchange to have all of their btc tied up in hot channels.
But it does result in customers getting their own money back. But they get even more money back, and that money is ultimately stolen from somewhere.

Which is even worse... Perhaps all of the miners will do this, and transactions will only ever be included at all when one miner wins 2 (or 6) blocks in a row.
When someone receives a Bitcoin payment, they would like to know if they are *actually* getting BTC, permanently (or if, instead, the txn will later be ousted from the chain). With Bitcoin, confirmation begins when your tx is mined into a block. With NG, it really doesn't begin until B finds his block. (B needs to have all of the a's, in order to make new blocks. So it's the same thing.)


Obviously the user just creates multiple "double spend" versions of such transactions...it costs them nothing...

This universe will die a heat death, but that doesn't mean that the word "permanent" can't facilitate efficient communication. Trying desperately to frame this as a mistake (when, in practice, no serious person expects a 100 block reorg), is only going to erase your own dignity.

ELI5: You have 21 million vanilla ice cream. You invent the concept of chocolate ice cream. It's similar to vanilla, because they're both ice cream.  You use sidechain magic to turn some of your vanilla into chocolate. The total quantity of ice cream stays at 21 million.
You decide that that is too much chocolate, so you turn a little chocolate back into vanilla.
Now you can have all the flavors, but keep the 21 million ice cream limit. Sally the scammer is always inventing terrible counterfeit vanilla ice cream.

Many of the comments here are complaining the "ethics" of the NYC location.
I get it. But, at the same time, my view is that [Silicon Valley is basically "NYC + Hypocrisy"]( -- fake hippie utopianism, masking the same unenlightened selfishness. Many people are lured to SF on naive dreams, and crushed by reality, etc. etc. At least the *adults* in NYC are fully aware of what they're doing.
So, I'm not saying NYC is the greatest, but -get real- large cities are convenient meeting-places. Within-US travel is easier than cross-national travel.
Moreover, few devs have any serious training (or curiosity) in finance. I see this deficiency as resulting in [multiple]( [screwups]( and tremendous [missed opportunities]( It would be easier to entertain complaints about The Capitol of Finance, if we didn't have so many amateur hour mistakes around here.

This, like NG, relies on the "splitting" of transaction fees, such that the agent responsible for including a message does *not* get 100% of that message's tx fees.
This is not incentive compatible. The including agent (ie, the miner) can profitably respond by publishing an address in advance, and having 100% of the fees go there. The equilibrium behavior is a few entrenched miners who all do this, hence the fees which this scheme would "split" would always be zero.

Roach seems to think that it is overwhelmingly likely that the USD/BTC exchange rate will increase by at least 50%.
I would:
1. Use $420 to buy a Bitcoin.
2. Offer roach 0.1 BTC bet, against his 0.9 BTC, that "exchange rate will *not* increase by at least 30% (of today's rate). He should be happy to accept because he strongly believes that 50% or greater is nearly guaranteed.
3. Profit (because I only lose my 0.1 BTC wager in situations where my remaining 0.9 is worth at least 1.17 of today's BTC...a free %17+ guaranteed return...in fact I can only lose $ if price crashes below $221).
This is a win win win...we both win money, a market inefficiency is corrected / debate is settled, and the Bitcoin price goes up earlier rather than later.
@_date: 2016-04-15 16:17:06


That is difficult. One could look at the total transaction fees, but that is just a floor on the value...the value of the good to the sellers under perfect competition.


Each coin would be pegged 1:1 to all other BTC. The side chain would start with zero coins such that the total remains at 21 million.
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:40:33
The attacker can just become a customer first.
Let me try again. Currently, 50 users deposit 5 BTC and $6000 each. The totals are 250 BTC and $300K. The exchange is hacked and loses all 250 BTC.
If the exchange used exclusively individual channels, the exchange must open a 5 BTC + 12 BTC channel, because (assume) each $6000 can be used to buy 12 BTC. The totals collected by the exchange are $300k and 850 BTC. The exchange is hacked, customers get their 250 BTC back, but the attacker steals 600 BTC from the exchange.
In this example, I chose numbers such that the cost of "insuring" the 250 BTC is actually greater than 250 BTC. You can pick different numbers but the problem is the same.
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:48:02
You're joking, right?
If we have A and B as two different miners, and chain:
Then A only gets 40% of the fees of the a's. Instead, he can charge a lower fee (say, 90% of the total), and upgrade from 40% to 90%. This is a profitable deviation for A and for all the Users. B has every incentive to do the same thing.
At this point, the only difference between NG and Bitcoin as it exists today, is that NG is *worse* because the large A block ("[A]-a-a-a-a-a-") isn't even finished until B finds his block.
At least with Bitcoin, you get *one* confirmation when A finds his block. With NG you have zero (because A can rewrite the block as much as he likes).

Big thanks to Sergio for his review of Drivechain...I think that he groked it the fastest, by far, (and with the least help) out of anyone I've directly corresponded with.
I'm honestly as surprised as anyone else, haha, but I daresay that these wacky "sidechains" might actually end up happening. (With versionbits, they may now happen even sooner.)
Looks like it's going to be a crazy summer after all!
Edit: The "notaries" element is mostly additive, so it can't hurt. However, I am a little at a loss for how a given sidechain will pick these notaries. Each notary will have to face down (tremendous) regulatory uncertainty, and the possibility of threats of violence / hack-attempts.
@_date: 2016-04-14 21:18:31
In 2-5 days I will be starting the bitcoin-dev mailing list conversation. It does depend a little on Sergio's input.
From there, we would face a technical discussion and public debate, then a review of the BIP pull request, and then we'd need to wait for miner activation of the soft fork. Then, each new sidechain would need miners to agree to merge mine it.
Not sure how long any of that other stuff will take.

I did change "Truthcoin" to "Hivemind", back when I relabeled everything. But other than that there are no changes.


I never suggested "crowdsales", I said that the second coin type allowed the project to be monetize-able. "Equity" is different from "a way to distribute that Equity".


See, this is exactly the problem with the Augur team. If the software *depends* on "who" owns the tokens, it isn't P2P. The whitepaper explains how the software works, in painfully clear detail.
Also: what is this supposed to mean?


Are you implying that I got the idea to call it reputation from Augur? Surely not, as that is laughable...it is described in my Dec 3rd, 2013 code, and the whitepaper, as reputation. More Augur self-delusions-of-grandeur, it seems.

Regarding your other point, if I am understanding it, it is, indeed, very well thought-out and correct. A pointless-to-parasite contract was discussed heavily in the comments section, and (in my view) the conclusion of the discussion did not invalidate any of my major claims: such a service ultimately becomes centralized, and most resembles a situation where Google provides a free oracle service. Therefore, it manages to invoke oracles without sidechains (and also, without Ethereum).
@_date: 2015-12-02 04:55:05

The drawback to being clear is: sometimes you're clearly wrong.
So, do you think anything I've written is wrong?


For example, this above quote is (what I would describe as) a "mainstream view". Do you think that *you* can logically see the future? Can someone else? Can you point us to this person?


Obviously I don't have a problem with experimentation. I was pro-Ethereum back when it was an academic, experimental idea...my objection is that it was then marketed as a great investment opportunity, [replacement to Bitcoin]( great [industrial tool]( etc. Moreover, if rolled out, Eth/Root would actually harm the future of smart contracts, as is obvious to anyone who *understands* that contracts inherently limit things and are the opposite of generality and anarchy.
@_date: 2015-12-02 04:40:05
Ultimately the users (people who run Bitcoin software) decide what Bitcoin "is" (but, without miners, their decision is kind of impotent). For all of Bitcoin's history we have only had mutually-compatible soft forks, such that everyone always decided the same thing. If two large groups of users (and miners) decide different things, the network splits.

No one will be spending the 70,000 in the weeks leading up to the halving, as you say, but why would these miners *then* go ahead and -as you claim- spend the 70,000 on the very day that revenues are cut in half?

Some reading to clear your mind:


@_date: 2015-12-15 22:43:39
To avoid parasite contracts, you must prevent the Smart Contract blockchain from learning about itself, for a considerable period of time. This is impossible and anyone who says that it is possible needs to have their head examined.
Or you must censor contracts, at which point the platform is not general (which was my whole point).
Perhaps you can wow us all, and explain how it can be done? Since "the main programmers of Ethereum" "have a much better overview of the capabilities", it should be *easy* for them to articulate an ingenious response.
By the way, Vitalik agreed with me, at one point, about (at least) SPV-proof based parasite contracts. Maybe he's changed his mind since then, but your "You are the only one claiming that" comment, I suspect, reveals how little you know about what you are talking about.

But, to just respond now: it's much easier than it looks. The assassination idea is to bet on "live" so that an assassin can bet on "die" and collect a bunch of money by killing someone. But any significant amount of money on "live" means that the die shares are available almost for free..basically a much, much cheaper life insurance that anyone would buy. (Whatever you try to use markets for, they always end up just producing forecasts).
There's lots more to say than that, of course.
Edit: "If someone spends $10,000,000 creating death shares on you, you can cancel them out for almost $0."

Oh, wow, thank you very much. I show them to my friends/family and they can't make heads or tails out of any of it (they call it "the Bitcoin thing").
I am proud of the fact that my figures use colors, though. Someone brought that up once (that I didn't use the grayscale icons from MS Visio or wherever people get them these days, and the outline-format) and I said something like "I'm not trying to impress anyone or get a job interview with this...my work doesn't need to look like other people's work, it just needs to get the ideas across as quickly and painlessly as possible." Ironically it did lead to a few job interviews.

Yes, thank you for pointing it out, as that sentence was one of the most important.


Worst case scenario, perhaps something like 3-6 years from now, if nothing else can be done, I might hope that Bitcoin's owners would hard fork into Truthcoin.


It actually shouldn't matter, but I had imagined that an auction would work for the first set.


*Only* if other misbehave. If everyone behaves the distribution of VTC does not change. The total quantity of VTC never changes.


It doesn't matter if one individual owns 1 account of 3 VTC or 6 accounts of 0.5 VTC. Their influence is the same.


Participation is measured by VTC-percentage, so, again, the number of accounts is irrelevant.


The voting integrity is maintained in two ways, one is the collapse in VoteCoin value, and the other are the {Miner Veto, Audit, Miner Override} "police force".


Firstly I doubt that anyone would be interested in buying post-failure at all, even at bargain-basement prices. But, re: "sell immediately", who are you selling to there? It seems that that is the true bargain basement opportunity. re: "gaming is being suspected" the purpose of RBCR is to make it so that gaming is constantly being suspected, so that legitimate concerns and bluffs are inseparable (and, ideally, both ignored).


My opinion is that those reputation systems are useless...see a later paragraph [here](
Thank you for taking the time to look into the project and comment!

Augur is a tech startup that contacted me in November about pivoting from their earlier project (Dyffy) to Truthcoin. I gave them a lot of written/presentation materials, and a lot of advice (which included that "a protocol doesn't need a tech startup, it just needs to be built") in return I had hoped they would build Truthcoin but what they are building is too different. Roger's programmer is excellent.

Not so. In gambling, the odds are fixed, but with markets, the odds (prices) change in response to the bets as they are placed.
This might seem like a trivial difference, but the varying and publicly-available prices can have a tremendously beneficial effect on society. See [this]( or [this](

Imagine you have green cash. When the network splits, your green cash will split into red cash and blue cash. Now you have twice as much cash. It doesn't matter if blue cash is worthless.
If your green cash is on an exchange, when it splits into red cash and blue cash, the exchange might throw away one of the types of cash (as BitStamp is sorta-claiming they will). If they throw away the wrong color, the business will probably close. If the business will close, employees will probably try to steal all the colors.
Just keep both colors for yourself.

No. The new protocol ("A") could fail in either case (Eth or BTC-fork), so the relevant issue is the base layer ("B").
The project as a whole is P = A + B + Interactions(A,B). By setting B="BTC-fork", B is very safe, as are the Interactions.
Again this is just one reason among many. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:32:56
There are a lot of reasons.
One of them is that "a protocol" is "a set of rules"..to have someone change these rules is to break the old rules / admit that the old rules have failed. Then, "a protocol" would not "exist" until it had been running for, say 6-12 months, without *hard* forks (which would mean that Ethereum doesn't exist and has accumulated no legit stress-testing).
I found "advising the Augur project" to be impossible.
@_date: 2015-06-24 05:04:31
It seems that you are defining "market transparency" to be "non-anonymity". If so, then your (circular) reasoning is valid.
My point is that the manipulation that I am worried about can not be done if there is transparency, defined in the Bitcoin way, as "everyone being able to see *what* is done".
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:49:04

It's my opinion that a lot of what is called "manipulation" is either [1] complaining about something which isn't there or [2] due entirely to non-transparency. Blockchains are entirely transparent so I'm not sure what you are worried about happening. Does that make sense?

Roger Ver described it as "possibly the most important thing since Bitcoin" (Roger regularly cries tears of joy when describing Bitcoin). Survived technical review by highly skeptical Bitcoin Core Devs including Peter Tood, etc.
If you are into risk management it might be up your alley. We are currently in the process of upgrading the front end, specifically the trading interfaces. I'm paul.sztorc on Skype if you want to contact me.
If you want to help Bitcoin in general, a much smaller, much easier, and much more-generally-helpful thing to do would be to code a 2-way peg so that we can all make use of sidechains. For example, I designed [Drivechain]( but I don't have time to code it at the moment.

Counterparty has a failed design (in a lot of ways).

Maybe I do. Either the blockchain knows its own state, or it doesn't.
It is difficult to imagine Eth developers being *that* dumb, so, more likely, they simply aren't working on oracle-related problems, and aren't thinking about it.

I don't know. If I were BitStamp, I would say "We will run nodes supporting every BIP, including non-BIPed Bitcoin Core, continuously throughout the next year. We are totally agnostic to the development process and will ensure that you, the user, get to keep your money, in whatever form you'd like it to take."
My guess is that someone convinced Nejc that he had to say that, so that Bitstamp could influence users. Users should dictate to businesses, surely?

Signatures take up a lot of space in each block. However, why do we need to keep signatures for transactions that are 3 years old? We can assume they were valid.
Also, Bitcoin lets you replace a check that you signed with a different check for the same amount/destination, but this screws up people holding a check they haven't cashed (they don't know if it will be replaced). Instead, stop allowing people to replace checks.

No...these are both effects of an unmentioned cause.
Glancing at, and misinterpreting 6 slides and "the start" of the whitepaper, both of which you now admit you don't understand, isn't really the start of a "debate". I do look forward to debate, but you are not (yet) qualified to participate, by your own admission.


You are still assuming that the proceeds all go to me. Moreover, as the creator, I own 100% of them already. Before me they did not exist.

I think you are mistakenly generalizing from business owners, who must establish a brand and reputation, to technologists, who must build something that works.
For this, the author should never matter, only the idea. Moreover, I knew that I lacked the skill to remain anonymous, so what I was suppose to sign it all with?


I think I've made it very clear that I want the papers heavily scrutinized. You admit in your comments that you haven't read them...that isn't skepticism.
My track record is irrelevant. I am deliberately asking people not to trust me at all; it is inherent to the design. 


I actually do care about my own feelings more. As far as I'm concerned, its reddit's loss.


I have multi-year, full-time academic associations with those institutions. I might clarify, but I still feel that the slide is clearly talking about me and not anything else. Perhaps you are right in suggesting that I am insensitive to scams, but perhaps also these scams have driven you to paranoia.


I can't agree with your use of the word scrutinize. Also, I am not selling anything (the sidechain tech gives it all away). You don't need to own votecoins to use the prediction markets, the VTC auction exists precisely so that one doesn't need to trust the initial allocation (it only incidentally raises money) so it is all free.

@_date: 2014-11-18 15:07:22
I should really insist that you narrow this down to your top 3 points or something, but here goes anyway.


The marginal cost **of the first unit** *is* the total cost. MC = TC/Q. I only need 1 of "what I am making" (enough blocks to become the longest chain). Perhaps you want to make something else? PoW forks are usually a few blocks (via accumulation, as I describe) but there's no reason to expect that in PoS, precisely *because* there is a big payoff to a huge fork (or would be, if anyone cared about PoS coins enough for them to have a "worth it"-market cap).


I think you should [read one]( first. In point 3 I describe (very generally) why a little "subjectivity" dooms the project to certain failure.
Your next two points are addressed in the blog post itself, a few paragraphs later. It seems you've written them while you were reading.

My name is Paul Sztorc, and I have already designed such a thing, and found several sources of funding and more than one team to build it. Originally planned as a hard fork of Bitcoin, it will now likely be a sidechain (probably the first one not built by Maxwell et al). In my opinion it can replace and even improve upon Ethereum, Bitshares, and Counterparty in several ways.

I could go through your paragraphs one by one (I'm quite prepared to defend my elaborate "investigation of consensus"), but instead, why don't we just wager?
I'm prepared to bet that the single component is stronger than 5 components. This is on my assumptions about what you did, which need to be clear: instead of taking the first Score, and normalizing that (as the "NewRep", which is later smoothed with the old rep), you took the eigenvectors from SVD, normalized them to use them as weights, and multiplied the n x 5 matrix of Scores by the the 5x1 matrix of weights to get a new n x 1 matrix of "FiveScores". From there on everything proceeds as normal?

Yes.  


No it isn't. In fact the reverse: Satoshi published de-facto anonymously, continuing a long tradition set by the Enlightenment thinkers (that ideas should rise or fall based on **their** merit, and not that of their author).
Your ostensible 'skepticism' is disingenuous. I discuss all of my claims in writing on the website. You did not respond to these claims.


They clearly disagreed with the contempt I feel for reddit (and obviously thought I [or they] would benefit somehow from the exposure).


Satoshi did neither of these things, whereas many of the proprietors of the business you mention as scams did do these things. On the other hand, by mentioning the universities in connection to myself, what other meaning could I possibly be trying to convey? That I visited them once?


I haven't decided yet. No. That shouldn't really matter, and all of them.


You're welcome.


The OP is quoting the second sentence of the truthcoin.info website, which contains a hyperlinked word 'applications' which leads to a document written by me that explains this in detail. This project and Ethereum take completely different approaches to solving a problem; when that happens, typically neither solution fully replaces the other: I chose to say that the applications "**include** superior **alternatives** to...".


I always appreciate feedback from everyone, but the pitch deck was designed to leave the viewer hungry for more, and to consume as few slides and words as possible. So I would probably not act on any suggestions to add more words/slides (more info is elsewhere), but if you want to replace some words/images with other words/images then go for it.

The way things currently are, and the way they have been in the past, miners get to ratify/veto protocol upgrades.


Miners can only ratify/veto what we call "soft forks". The non-softfork rules are "meta rules", similar to how US Congress can't pass a law interfering with Freedom of the Press (etc).


I agree. Nonetheless, miners are "in a political dialogue" today. I try to explain this aberration above, and my explanation is that it is the result of a number of unexpected and simultaneous failures.

You won't find anything, because the ideas are new!
Actually, that isn't true. I buried the second idea in the appendix of my sidechain risks presentation (because it was already too long). You can find these slides beginning on [page 157 of this deck]( It isn't *that* new. Basically, it is a strong preconsensus, advising miners on how to earn more money by agreeing to a future block's hashMerkleRoot. Other benefits include safer lightning channels and a more-logical fee experience. The downside is vaguely slower confirmation. However the current 1st confirmation already takes 10-30 minutes, which is already slow, so the marginal inconvenience is very low. With LN it is a strict improvement with no downsides (that I can see). It allows miners to customize the blockspace they sell, so that it is a better fit for LN.
And the first idea I did [mention in a recent blog post]( I did refer to it as "insurance", though. It is a little hard to explain but basically miners can bet that they will *not* find a block. If they find a block, they lose the bet. If they don't find a block, they win the bet. With some hand-waving, miners can make the exact same amount of money every 10 minutes, whether they find a block or not. This is still very theoretical, but I was doing the math last week, and got some very encouraging results. It might very cheap if the idea is popular among many small miners, and the setup costs seem low. I searched for incentive-vulnerabilities but I haven't found any, yet. But it could still not work for a few reasons.
The efficiency that this combo would have over pools, is something that Ittay Eyal can explain to you, go bother him and not me.
I don't really see any reason to explain anything in more detail. If you prefer more practical stuff, with working code and unit tests, then I am also doing projects at that stage. I try to help at all stages of the R&amp;D process. These two ideas happen to be early "in the pipeline", as I say, and I will probably not have time to even work on them for a month or two.


I will assume you are speaking to I do not post here in anymore, and I try even to avoid commenting here, if I can help it. I am only commenting today because I was asked to do so.

I understand that some people are annoyed with "announcement" posts. This is mostly because scammers have used them to pump ridiculous ICO projects / Bitcoin competitors, or spook developers to try and steal mindshare. I, however, have never done either. So you can just deal with it.
Some people enjoy these posts, either to cheerlead, or to be aware of threats to their livelihood, or to avoid duplication of work or missed collaboration opportunities.


Correct! *Something* must indeed collect some money and redistribute it. While in the past, people have tried to *defend* against the mining pool, I instead try to build a more efficient version, that has other properties that we like.

Hi I'm Paul Sztorc the creator of this video.
I still agree with all of the content.
However, let me elaborate, in light of [recent events](
I believe that the Bitcoin system *requires* the miners to do whatever *they believe* is in the best interest of the BTC unit they are paid in. As I say in the video, I feel that miners are "docile". They are like a horse, or some other farm animal -- they are friendly, and want to work with the farmer so that the whole farm can be happy (unlike a polar bear, which is a vicious killing machine, or a mouse, which is just a thief and not a team player).
[i] Why then, are miners rejecting SegWit? Miners claimed they wanted 2MB, and now they are getting 2MB (with SegWit)! At first glance it seems confusing. And [ii] why are the miners making all kinds of threats?
Well, you should really ask them! But no one ever seems to be able to get ahold of them...
So I will take my best guess:
While miners are *required* to be docile, developers are not. In particular, the Devs can harm Bitcoin through their *inaction*, ie by being lazier than expected. It is as if the horse (miner) is pulling a carriage containing the horse's foals, which is being driven by the farmer (devs). They are all trying to get back to the farm -the foals are hungry or whatever- but the farmer keeps pointlessly stopping the carriage along the way (or, so the horse believes). So the horse just refuses to move at this point, until the farmer takes this 'travel business' more seriously.
Miners want X, where X is possibly some vague combination of "scalability", "larger blocks", "respect/representation", and "dominance". Some devs don't want to give miners those things. Speaking very loosely, "some people" gave miners a reason to block SegWit, but effectively saying "miners suck. miners suck. miners suck." and then, often in the same breath, saying "I can't wait for the miners to activate SegWit, SegWit is so cool".
I think miners are rejecting SegWit *because they know* that SegWit is **good**. They know that the devs like it. They want a bargaining chip against the devs.
Why do they feel they need a bargaining chip?
Well, Bitcoin *had* a process for **resolving disputes** -- the Scaling Conferences. The original motivation of these conferences, as I remember it, was the rise of BitcoinXT and resulting confusion about what to do. We rushed to meet in Montreal, and, shortly thereafter in Hong Kong, we collaborated on actionable (ie, **short**-term) proposals. The compromise was 2 MB segwit, and it was made in *early December 2015*. By the time Milan rolled around it was almost a year after that. The LargeBlockers almost-certainly expected new *actionable* solutions to be presented in Milan.
Only two people presented such solutions. And they were both buried in obscure locations in the program. Many LargeBlockers were so dismayed by the conference agenda, that they did not turn up to the conference at all. To my knowledge, most (&gt;80%) LargeBlockers that did show up, actually left the conference before they could hear either of these two proposal-presentations (as Day 1 happened to lead off with a lengthy fungibility section). The first of these was intentionally understated, for political reasons. The second (Schnorr sig-agg) was relatively medium-term, and relied on SegWit activation (which had itself already been greatly delayed, taking roughly 250% as long as had been 'promised').
While it had many impressive speakers and topics, Scaling 2016 did not facilitate the resolution of disputes. It was instead a more traditional academic conference. I will say also that many people brought their prejudices with them to the conference, and were uninterested in discarding them. In fact, those few who attempted to work "across the aisle" were labeled as disloyal and unreliable (and still are). Presentations about "process" or "community" were mocked as wasting valuable time.
Thus, miners lost their original "voice" (in the "voice vs exit" paradigm) and have now searched for a new one. And now they found a louder one.
As for [ii] the threat, it is very normal for someone who is threatened, to author a threat in response. I still think Luke's threat, to change the PoW-algo, is more persuasive than the miner's threat to try to kill a "CoreCoin". Bitcoin would probably survive, even if attacked by $100M while it's hashrate was (temporarily) low. The whole affair would, however, [a] be very embarrassing, [b] interrupt service for ~3 months, and [c] probably set the project back at least 6-12 months. (And we would need some way of convincing the next generation of miners that we would not stab them in the back unless XYZ reasons, which we don't really have.) So we should not change the PoW-algo unless we have no other choice (ie, the Chinese gov't seizes the ASIC equipment at gunpoint and tries to destroy Bitcoin with it).
I mostly stand behind the video, but I did not expect "some people" to -essentially- subvert the incentives of Bitcoin, by insulting/distressing the miners to the point where they would feel the need to retaliate against the entire developer community in this way. I was more optimistic about the dialogue between miners and developers back then (in September) than I am now.
If anyone is interested, I very recently (this week) wrote three pieces on the subject of "miner centralization":

Well, if I define it explicitly, you'll realize what the problem is, and also that you'll lose the bet. Why don't you just use whatever you want and we'll see what happens.
But, I'd hate for our audience to go home empty-handed, so I suppose we must return to the cheap tawk:


No. martinBrown did, long before Augur even existed. The fact that you hired (?) him doesn't change that. Even [your most knowledgeable team member has apparently almost no idea how the LS-LMSR works]( MB was very smart about how he wanted to contribute: he picked a totally modular part of Truthcoin that had nothing to do with the part that I had already spent months working on, and spent months on it himself. That's why he succeeded.


Great, then you should know that it produces orthogonal vectors. In other words, if you took the first five vectors, you'd measure one thing first, and then 4 things which are guaranteed to be, conceptually, entirely different from that first thing and each other.


If more than half the reporters give "not X", then "X" should (more often) be known to be the "wrong" answer, flipping your group of liars and the honest, something you would have realized if you understood the challenges of P2P-dependent reality. Measuring against some hardcoded "Jack's 'Right' Answers" is completely missing the point.


The most common *research use* for PCA **is** to obtain relationships between variables, which makes the "fraction of explained variance" of the first one or two components (as these are typically the only two which can be graphed, or discussed comprehensively) highly relevant. But, in Truthcoin's case, the fraction of explained variance is simply not relevant: TC aims to build an index of tacit-(dis)coordination, NOT to maximally re-represent the actual data-content of the VoteMatrix.


Your definition of "liars" is wrong so your analysis is meaningless.


I'm sure it must feel "pointless" to you, as you seem genuine in your dismissal of ("obliviousness to") my serious concerns. While I admire your willingness to check my work and try to improve upon it, you (and others) have tried this on more than a handful of times, and always failed. I've been working on this since 2012, the fact that you even think you can succeed in making an intellectual contribution, when last August you were struggling with the introductory question of why Truthcoin has two coins, trespasses upon the offensive.
@_date: 2017-02-17 00:30:04
Altcoin: "Alt"ernative coin to Bitcoin. Has different network, different protocol rules, different account balances, and different account histories.
Soft fork: Adds new rules to a network, and uses miners to filter out transactions that break these new rules. Old rules are preserved (although see [this]( for more details) and old nodes are (usually) unaffected. Network, account histories and balances, and old protocol rules are all the same.
Spin-off: New (different) network, new protocol rules, but same account balances and histories.
Hard fork: same network, new rules, same account balances and histories. In order to accomplish this, the entire old network must surrender to the new network. BitShares and Ethereum did this [many times]( especially early in their history when the design was unfinished.
TLDR; a spin-off where the original chain dies.

I'm afraid you've only convinced me that you don't understand how Truthcoin works. The purpose of SVD is the reporter's incentives (the "Agents" section, not the "Decisions" section), not the calculated outcomes. The backwards-causality is: [3] Outcomes caused by [2] Submitted Ballots caused by [1] RBCR incentives.
So the key is "do those individuals who submitted the modal "70" earn the most in RBCR, and do others earn more the closer they are to "70"? Otherwise you could just use *the* mode. (And, of course, this is why the SchellingCoin thought experiment isn't sophisticated enough to work).


You have again misunderstood. The problem isn't that multiple eigenvectors are used, it is the way you've used them. Adding together orthogonal vectors just re-blurs the data that SVD worked so hard to un-blur.
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:11:18


It probably is just you. Do you consider a rattlesnake's rattle to be a threat? I do. The whole point of making a threat is to say "this is mine and if you don't agree there will be trouble".

Intellisys will probably only feature bad deals (the first is Granger's buying his ~family's waste management business from ~himself, many red flags --see video). Even if the deals are good, there is no reason for Intellisys to hire Charlie, other than to use his name and personal brand to *scam Bitcoiners out of their Bitcoin*.
And even if all the deals are pristine, and work out, it is foolish for Charlie to run afoul of SEC regulations, or do anything connected to money transfers which is even remotely confusing or "innovative". This is a betrayal of everyone who supported Charlie when he was first arrested.

I'm not sure how "preferred miner" works, but one easy way would be for all pools to post a BTC address. And you send your fee to that address (and pay zero "regular fee"). Instead of manually paying one person you manually pay two people: the merchant and the miner.
This has some disadvantages...makes your transaction bigger, pools need to upgrade software to be aware of these fees.
Preferred miner seems to require you to trust that they will only share the txn with the one pool you selected. This probably won't work because of "spy mining", but it is a good first try, I guess.
@_date: 2017-02-05 03:24:29
A model is necessarily unrealistic. A good model is like a good map -- enough of the details have been removed to allow you to focus on what's important (and to allow it to be shrunk down to fit in your pocket). A model of every detail of the universe would be too complicated to be useful.
Nonetheless, my video claims that miners are not in a position to make threats, but they are sorta making threats now. So I feel it incumbent upon myself to explain why the map I created doesn't have these types of landmarks.

They are sideways pdfs (probability density functions). The graph is very pictorial, the x axis would certainly be discrete, not continuous.
I would label the Y axis as "excess returns on capital", and then there would be a Z axis coming out of the page, representing the proportion of miners at the given density level.

That's not a very good bet because Mr. Srinivasan and I had a long private twitter chat about it. I'll do the sportsmanlike thing and decline the bet.
The major point of disagreement is on the ease of getting BTC in the hands of consumers, and whether or not this inconvenience justifies an X000% markup.
I agree that LN won't be available for a while, but I think we will see it in 2016. I think Sidechains will happen even earlier.
I really didn't care about it that much, and I definitely do understand what he is proposing (see the last paragraph of [this answer]( I think people are missing that the idea, of timestamping a database of Bitcoin-account balances, isn't useful because nothing prevents individuals from timestamping an "invalid" database or several databases at once.
@_date: 2016-03-03 00:52:23


Actually, the reverse is true. Assume that the BTC exchange rate doesn't change, and imagine anyone could get an optimally-efficient chip, for free. The result would be that, after 6 weeks or so, difficulty would skyrocket, and only those people living in the cheapest-power areas would be mining. Difficulty would eventually plateau (it might fall before it does this).
Then the reward halves, and 0% of these thin-margin miners can still mine profitably. They were spending $799 in power to get **two** $400 coins...now they're spending $799 in power to get **one** $400 coin.
The more optimized the overall system, the more fragile it becomes to an external shock. It would be better if there was an ever-present, dynamic, turnover in chips to keep the waters rough.

If all the transactions are going to F2Pool, I can send one of my ASICs over there, and get their GetBlockTemplate (or whatever we call it these days...the hollow Merkle tree that is hashMerkleRoot but allows for changing the extraNonce in the leftmost part), and then I can just bring that info back to ViaBTC (or sell it to all the other pools).

Nope, haha.
It is -certainly- a very reasonable *thing to want to know*. However, it is an unreasonable *question* because it is too difficult to provide an honest answer (and too tempting to "cheat" and just guess something at random).
[Here is the roadmap]( though. It is a vague measurement of progress.
I am currently focused on Drivechain, because Hivemind first needs Drivechain in order to work (as a sidechain).
( By the way, here is [a funny link to a Bitshares forum post in May 2014]( where prediction markets (ht Fairlay) were themselves used to forecast the launch of Bitshares. These PMs nearly-perfectly guessed the true launch date of Aug 22...much to the amazement of the Bitshares community/leadership (who, of course, were chanting "soon" and "two weeks" endlessly). Currently, there are [only 3 cryptocurrency PMs]( on Fairlay that I could find, but perhaps we should persuade Martin to add some for LightningNetwork and Hivemind. That way, everyone could learn [especially me]! )

I don't understand why you would describe that as "the main point"?
Miners, as a group, can only accumulate ~25.01 BTC every 10 minutes. Even over an unreasonable length of time (say, months), this quantity can't compete with the 15 million+ coins currently in circulation.
In fact, in my view, miners don't really own Bitcoin at all. They merely own the *option* to buy ~25.01 Bitcoins at price X (where price X becomes "the" expected price of Bitcoin, every two weeks). Miners have to pay their power bill, of course. Even if the power company accepted Bitcoin, it doesn't make the bill go away.

As I already explained, if you want to filter out the liars, just take the mode of each and filter out everyone who didn't answer with the mode.


You add the scores, which are constructed by multiplying the normed data A by the loadings. The loadings are "V" from the UsV, both U and V are orthogonal eigenvector-containing matrices of AtA, AAt. The language is just very wordy. I always omit "[SVD] on the weighted covariance of A", for example, why write the whole thing? If you were referring to the fact that the sums are weighted, it matters even less. It is the same flaw: collapsing dimensions always destroys information. 


By all means, do whatever you like. I was simply asked questions, and unjustly accused of poor design work and poor testing, and am simply trying to defend my reputation.


You might understand {SVD, something, and some of Truthcoin}, I didn't imply otherwise. It is, however, presumptuous of you to think you understand TC better than me, enough to make changes like the one you're proposing. If you are going to reference my work, and list me as an adviser, people will assume that you are following my design and advice. If your software fails to operate, people will (wrongly) conclude that there was a problem with my design, which makes what you do here, unfortunately (I detest reddit) my problem.

Well you know I didn't actually check, too busy, but it would go something like:
1. **Within each 2016 cycle**, mining is a defined Poisson process.
2. So the arrival of each block will follow an exponential distribution.
3. Exponential distribution is [memoryless](
4. Assuming each miner instantly has the latest block, nothing any miner does affects the 'blocks found'/time rate of any other miner.
So, within-cycle, miners do not really "compete". Across cycles, they very clearly *do* compete...this is a problem of making it to the next cycle (after which, everything is fine).

Exchange rate volatility is a factor...if the exchange rate regularly falls by 50% (or has recently risen by a large amount, say 30%), then the halving is almost identical to a (routine) price collapse.

Finally, the highly-financed 21 startup has a very ambitious (and, to some of us, bizarre) business model.

I might be wrong, because I honestly didn't check and I do a lot of heavy drinking on Wednesday nights, but I think the proof-of-work criterion has a Memorylessness property which makes the mining cost independent of what any other miners do.
That is, within each 2016 block cycle, revenue should be independent of other miners. Someone with 1% of the hashing power should take 201600 * 10 minutes to find 2016 blocks, regardless of what anyone else does.

I haven't watched the whole thing, I only had time to skim it.
The proof of space idea is very interesting. It exploits the fact that each individual person has an incentive to invest in more space than they need, and then leave that space unused. If a block is worth $100, people will "bid" on winning-the-block until society has spent roughly a total of $100. But what *this* does is let people bid with "hard drive bucks" that are otherwise useless. Effectively it makes all storage everywhere more valuable, at exactly the same time it requires storage to "waste" some of its value.
It still falls victim to the original premise of "waste is required", I think. If China wanted to build their version of [this thing]( *and* wanted to attack Bitcoin at the same time. They could build the facility, attack Bitcoin "for free", and then reuse the equipment in their datacenter.
But perhaps not. Perhaps the 10 exabytes (or whatever) of space at the Utah data center is actually smaller than the total amount of space that people would commit to the Bitcoin network (because this space is unused, therefore otherwise un-useful).
Interestingly, if anything like Sia or Storj (or Wuala?) catches off, such that you can rent out your unused hard drive space, then Proof-of-Space will be as directly wasteful as PoW. (Because the introduction of Po-Space will not do that first step of making the hard drives more valuable, because it will already have been done.)
@_date: 2017-02-04 22:22:25


I can only speak to my own observations. Whenever I've seen Chinese miners in a scaling context, they seem frustrated, angry, bitter, etc. When I meet with people who say that *they* know the miners, these witnesses also use words like "frustrated", "annoyed", "exasperated" to describe how they think miners are feeling.
Perhaps you are asking about my opinion as to why miners might feel this way?
Of course it is a miscommunication. (But to blame conflict on miscommunication is a cop-out, I think.)
Given how little communication we see from Chinese miners here, it would not surprise me to learn that just as little goes back in that direction. Thus, mostly silence, where everyone just huddles together and confirms each other's suspicions.
In Hong Kong, there was a panel of miners. It was **very** informative, because I strongly got the impression that miners mostly don't understand the dev side. They have their own problems (power, maintenance, procurement, sales, etc). At the time, they were annoyed at being asked to weigh in! They just wanted someone to tell them what to do, so that they could go back to printing money! This is fertile soil for misunderstanding.

You may be confused due to a dual-use of the word "production". Liquid has not actually launched yet, to my knowledge, and so it is reasonable to assume that it is not "at production level", but merely "being produced".

Nope, it is doing fine. I just don't like to talk about it. Ethereum and Bitshares and Factom are all just blah blah blah. I don't want my project to be like that at all.
I realize that this reticence gives people the (false) impression that I'm not passionate about the project. Personally, I am OK with people having that impression. As we know, "most people", even in the Bitcoin community, don't have the time or expertise required to construct an informed opinion. Many of the smartest minds in all the land have praised my project (both in private and in public) as being either "the most" or "one of the most" important blockchain projects since Bitcoin.

Quite correct. That is **exactly** what this is!
If the bet is successful, we win SegWit. If unsuccessful, we lose SegWit. But if a SegWit chain is less valuable, we should *want* to lose it as quickly as possible!
Unfortunately, the present social / media conditions prevent us from objectively measuring *overall* support of SegWit (ie, it's market value). So we might as well run this experiment and get it over with.

Adam and Austin would tell you that Rootstock and Hivemind are also in production. ZeroCash, Monero, and Litecoin will almost certainly be brought over. Just another example of how out of touch you are.


You are describing "a database". No one denies that databases are great. However, unlike Satoshi's blockchain, they require an administrator. They are not P2P, and hence, these admins would need to comply with all KYC/AML rules, etc.
Why does Bitcoin *use* a database (LevelDB)? Why don't we get rid of the blockchain-stuff and just do everything in LevelDB? That would be faster and simpler. Don't you know that "in technology speed, simplicity, and reliability do matter"?

This is a description of the Lightning Network. However, his description is of a much much *worse* Lightning Network where you have to trust the summary coming from the private chain.
It is very revealing that this guy "wants to help fund" something which has already become a 'household term' in Bitcoin (and is already being funded/worked-on/the-soft-fork-it-needs-is-nearly-finished).
If he absolutely insists on adding a "private blockchain", he has simply reinvented the traditional bank, or traditional database, where, again, trust is required.

The thing is, as I tried to explain, Liquid itself hasn't even launched, despite being relatively ultra-simple and not depending on the (as yet, unfinished) two way peg.

Another excellent NI article.
Experts in X consistently notice that ETH is "fundamentally flawed" for an X reason. The X's include {cryptography, macro/micro econ, design, implementation, leadership/organization, ...}. Every expert finds a *different* fundamental flaw (and each believes theirs to be "the" deal-breaker flaw)!
This overwhelming pessimism never seems to dent Eth-enthusiasm. In fact, if anything it seems to *drive* confidence.
I think that this is due to ETH's value proposition (replacing Bitcoin, &amp; a second shot at wealth).
To best deliver on such a VP, ETH needs to find a big network. Criticism of ETH, from BTC, may help with this -- (in a very Trump-like way) it makes ETH seem "relevant" enough to "threaten" BTC. This inspires developers to flock to Eth, even if the users, investors, and elite scientists aren't there.
Because the relevant issue is not "I want to make amazing things for their own sake. Which cryptosystem is objectively good, and why?". Instead it is "I want to make a ton of money by resetting the early-adopter clock, if possible. Where would I find like-minded people?".

The comparison is fallacious.
In many obvious ways, Bitcoin is unlike gold. Gold is a physical thing with many uses (jewelry, conduction, engineering, ...). However, Bitcoin can replicate **one** use-case of gold: that of a value storage-and-transfer medium.
The non-gold use-cases of oil are [1] combustion, and [2] the creation of plastic. So, for the analogy to hold, one would have to **be able to use Ether to warm their home**! It's laughable!!
But it is very easy to be fooled, if your [secret subconscious motivation is, in fact, to replace BTC](

Is your premise is that miners should not collect any fees? If so, why would anyone hash?
Or, perhaps you are saying that, if they allow everything, since X% of everything will be valid, then miners will still collect some fees which are valid. This pushes all validation to "full nodes" (as desired), but it seems to me the situation is now even worse. If you join one network (for example, the Bitcoin network), you are actually signing up to commit an unlimited amount of bandwidth, processing, and storage. It is much more "unlimited" than Bitcoin Unlimited.
PT has some plan for a kind of permanent SPV mode where no one is a full node, which I'm afraid I still don't understand. In particular I do not understand how it prevents double spends.
It is probably best to wait for PT to make a blog post or paper about the idea.
@_date: 2016-11-07 18:24:45
It's a nice idea, but the blockchain is a broadcast medium, that exists *in* the physical internet. While physical internet is rate-limited by actual physical cables and ISPs and bill collectors, the blockchain is rate-limited by fees. In order for miners to collect these fees, they must be able to validate the txns which pay these fees.
So it would seem to encourage miners to validate everything unconditionally. This, in turn, would seem to contradict Peter's original purpose as well as contradict his stance on "mining decentralization".
I'm sure he is hard at work, writing this up somewhere. But I see an unalterable difference, wrt to the blockchain's fees, which are essential and encourage validation.

For example, in the comments section of this very link, Jack Peterson attempts to turn my statement ["Augur is a broken version of Truthcoin, please fix your mistakes"]( into some kind of "Augur is different from Truthcoin, we deserve credit for our value-add". The team never had anything-like the right technical skills, had no interest in hiring the people I recommended, and has a long history of making many basic (and fatal) technical mistakes, so Roger Ver and I decided to start over (and we've already nearly finished something much better, which Bitcoin users can use for free).

I think I know what you mean, though. If miners mine for heat, they won't care as much about the Bitcoin economy. I agree completely, but "as much" doesn't mean "at all". If the miner misbehaved (on the wrong chain), its owner would still be paying "too much" for heat (for no reason).

I do, but the conclusions are sort of obvious (one single person, who confidently knows the answer, needs to have anonymous access to a sufficiently-liquid market). Literature emphasizes the relevance of liquidity so, theoretically, it would be nice if we could get donations to be used by the automated market makers here.
In fact IIRC some experts would claim it would be best to have total donations = the total value of the information, (which we aren't going to get anywhere near, as the info is probably worth ~X million dollars).

I'm afraid it probably won't happen. Everyone is too busy with their own projects and developer time is over-scarce. And, I think, this dramatic struggle has been so bitter, that at this point both sides just want to win (for their egos) and couldn't care less about "the community" or "doing something that would work". All the correspondence I've seen has become increasingly irrational, so it looks like (as you say) we will have a contentious split, with macroeconomic instability, bad press, hurt feelings all around, and probably half the developer talent leaving for good.
Possibly a 3-5 year setback for Bitcoin, all because we relied on obsolete communication/governance technology.

OK, in gambling, the "odds" are fixed. By this I mean that, if you bet on a coin flip, the odds of you winning are 1:1 (1 for, 1 against, "evens") or 50%. This logically implies that you could NOT place a bet that would cause you to do more than double your money (1/(50%)). In a roulette wheel, individual numbers return 35x, no matter what.
But in a prediction market, the buying and selling takes place in a market. Buying a state causes its price to rise. The price represents the likelihood (or "probability", or "odds") of the event actually happening.

Markets work better with scale, no doubt of it.


If a consequence escapes the notice of the PM, then I would be reasonably confident that it would also go undetected by every other forecast mechanism (as PMs are really a meta-forecast tool).


I'm not worried about that at all. Every single forecasting tool is subject to manipulation and overconfidence/ignorance, but with PMs a group of low-information traders ("sheep") can actually attract the informed ("wolves") who might otherwise not participate at all. Similar to how elite poker players won't sit down at the same table unless there is at least one sucker.


I don't think so. Democracy is "one person, one vote", plutocracy is "one dollar, one vote", but this is "one vote for each dollar *risked*", which I would try to describe as "capitalism". Voting for A incurs the same private cost as voting for B, but risking money on A vs B is an entirely different story.

Interest in this project faded for a few reasons, an important one was that users were unwilling to trust the oracles not to collude (in general, but also specifically wrt the "exit scam").
[My own project]( eliminates the exit scam in a few ways, the chief of which is by allowing users to "sell" reputation they've accumulated.

Yes, Truthcoin (and this proposal) is designed to only make decisions and release payments after events take place. PP made a foolish mistake in releasing the funds early, and they made the mistake for no good reason (in fact, if anything, you could hit it with a "centralized" criticism).


Could I ask you to cite this? Because [1] I doubt that the odds were overwhelming, or [2] my guess is that somehow people knew that PP would (wrongly) pay out on 'Yes' early. Either way I'm interested but I couldn't find any figures with quick Googling.

That would be true of everything, though, wouldn't it? I think that markets are actually less-reflexive than conversations. George Soros shorting the pound is an example of him breaking a reflexive loop which was constantly overvaluing the pound, as the US housing crisis broke a reflexive loop that was driving up the price of real estate. So markets might be micro-reflexive (like many things) but at least they are cumulatively macro-anti-reflexive.

Even if your premise were true, I don't think your conclusion ("the op proposal can't help") would necessarily follow.

In the 8-state case (with some of the finance caveats I mention in the post), if you made both of the horizontal dimensions to be the same BTC/USD exchange rate, state 3 **is** long a USD-denominated futures contract on a 1 MB Bitcoin's BTC/USD price and state 4 is is long a USD-denominated futures contract on a &gt;1 MB Bitcoin's (and you could re-specify "&gt;1" as "8") BTC/USD price.

Actually, I'm not. Here I propose that Truthcoin be stripped down (removing all of the honesty-inducing P2P oracle stuff, economic limiting of the Decision-slots, etc.) and fixed to offer a static, predefined number of markets (maybe 15 or so maximum). Call it "The 2015 Blocksize Governance Sidechain". It would contain as little new code as possible, and rely on the "functionaries" (the individuals who manage the federated peg) to report on the outcomes (which should be almost zero work for them).
It doesn't even need to be Truthcoin stripped down, it contains so little of "what makes Truthcoin Truthcoin" (and so little in general), that it could be written from scratch.


Although you could do this, my proposal is in two parts (you're describing Part 2). Part 1 is that that you build a cool portfolio which is essentially a conditional bet on Bitcoin (for example "I want to buy Bitcoin, conditional on blocksize increasing"). Part 2 is to do that entire portfolio in the left half of the bigger 8-state market. This would price the entire bet "in BitUSD".
The "goal metric" doesn't need to be the exchange rate, however. So you could say "I want to earn USD if increasing the blocksize relatively reduces the number of full nodes".
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:38:20
It does rely on an oracle. However, because the federated 2 way sidechains peg *already* relies on (what Blockstream is calling) "functionaries", no marginal trust is required (if the functionaries are bad, the coins will be long gone by the time the oracle can mis-report).
It should not "rely" on a USD peg. The oracle should enforce the peg at time=Final, and arbitrage should enforce the peg at all earlier times.

@_date: 2016-02-03 04:16:38


You might be onto something there. Unfortunately, I think in your version, the miners will just run a full node, and claim both sets of transaction fees immediately. Maybe you can tweak it a little to improve it. The other thing is, of course, a per block proof is just much much less overhead than a per transaction proof.
@_date: 2016-02-10 21:52:40


Sorry, but: no it doesn't. It *might* make sense, if you were arguing that total tx fees must rise to offset losses in blockreward revenue, but d(total_fees)/d(quantity) can be &gt;0, 0, or &lt;0, depending on demand elasticity, and in 22 weeks I would bet that it would actually be &lt;0.


Bypassing a requirement is always easy -- we can just not require it. Yet, we do require such a threshold. You should probably look into why we have the threshold, before you write about how it should be abandoned.

Definitely centralized prediction markets, of course. BetMoose and Fairlay have the most ridiculous order books / UI, though.
You know, an entrepreneurial person could probably set it up pretty quickly, if they knew about security. The user-interface could be entirely API, or even just Google Docs, or perhaps it could be Counterparty-style OP_RETURN embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain. I'd be happy to help anyone who's interested, particularly if they can prove their trustworthiness (as this requires users trusting them not to steal the coins). I think I wouldn't get into too much trouble holding a multisig private key, so I'd do that as well.

Right, BH would probably make the protocol harder to upgrade. The Hashers will get a ROI on their time, if they spend it seeking out cheaper power / maintaining equipment / better facility design etc. But if they spend it upgrading the protocol, then the benefits are diffused (among their competitors no less).
The same indifference that (supposedly) prevented Hashers from caring about the fact that pools were blocking SegWit, would not be defeated by BH in this case. Instead, the indifference would itself block SegWit directly.

Well that would do it.
( Although I don't think this one is fundamentally impossible...the audience should know that this is far from my area of expertise, but give that q=H(H(block)) is fully random [unlike the nonce, which is only random-for-convenience], something like x = Mod( H(q), 2^32 ), and Rule = each block must have a "footer" of Hash("x-th bytes, wrapped") might work (?) )
Precomputation sounds harder to avoid, especially given a direct incentive to do so (especially as returns to hardware-tech investment being to diminish). Clearly the search-space would somehow need to become very large...two random numbers, enforced random block sizes, or something else. Guaranteeing that it is large, sounds hard to do (but probably not impossible).


That *is* narrower. You would not suggest that that internalizes the full node externality (because you knew, correctly, that it would not).


Not very well, to be sure.

You keep using the phrase, but you've never bothered to understand what it means.
As I've explained to you several times now, Schelling's focal point only applies to a game where the players [1] can *not communicate*, and [2] can meet anywhere *with equal payoff*. Since we can and do communicate, and as the payoff tomorrow is obviously different, for many reasons, than one two weeks or two months from now (either lower, in terms of likelihood of implementation bug, or higher, in that uncertainty has been resolved earlier) there is nothing against which to invoke the concept.
If anything, the opposite is the case, as the halving will be associated with heart-attack problems and greater-than-average uncertainty amid (probably) a falling hashrate, so isolated miners might set flag day to 2 years 23 weeks, the furthest possible distance from the halving.
@_date: 2016-02-11 14:28:29
I don't have time to keep explaining this to you *yet again*.
One final time: If you reject "official" definitions, consider that, if the players could communicate, or if one outcome *in the game* had the highest payoff (highest payoff net of benefits, if travel costs are part of the game), there would be absolutely **zero** need for the players to read any "salience" from the game's "poetic" features.
That's as simple as I can make it. If you still disagree, then feel free to propose "your own personal" definitions of various words and terms (aka "useless definitions"), as you regularly do, and leave it at that.
@_date: 2016-02-01 15:43:38
Not up to your usual standards.
Your counterargument relies on the inconvenience of reversing "days/weeks" worth of transactions, where we both know that anyone who was running a full node would not see any reversal whatsoever (a reversal of 0 minutes, for those of you in the audience).
So your argument relies on either [1] not a single person is running a valid node (which directly contradicts what I said) or [2] no one is connected to anyone in the original "real" network (in which case they would be unable to run a full node, also in direct contradiction to what I said). Or you are simply saying that it takes X weeks to start up a new full node -- for a time briefer than X, you are "unable" to run a node, exactly consistent with my description.
In my hypothetical reality, users would be alerted to a conflict almost immediately, at which point they would temporarily and instantly upgrade to a full node to check for themselves what was going on. It is their inability to quickly and easily do this which is (in a point so obvious as to be tautological) the source of all validation problems.
Even if you were right, the gun analogy would still stand -- one could argue (with merit) that some critical mass of citizens should be gun owning NRA zealots, lest the-powers-that-be move quickly to confiscate the entire firearm supply chain (at which point it would be 'too late', etc).
It is very revealing that, too busy though you apparently are to respond to my requests for sidechain technical review (which would bring a swift end to your political opponents, and help Bitcoin), you can apparently dedicate hours out of each day to the noble task of reviewing minutiae of this caliber. Perhaps the braying inquiry into your priorities has some merit after all, even if unintended.

If $100 worth of BTC is created every 10 minutes, total economic expenditures by _miners_ will be $100. If you suggest that miners must spend ~all of this on nodes, then payments from miners to node operators will equal $100. Currently, nodes receive $0 and there are ~5000 of them, it stands to reason that, after being paid, there would tend to me &gt;$5000.
It matters because [1] you can get paid if you run a node, and [2] because you don't have to worry (as much) about the node count falling to zero (which would make you unable to run one yourself). Currently miners are paid ~1.5 million a day...not clear how much of that would end up in the hands of each full node operator, but even if it amounted to $20 a month that would tend to un-imbalance the economics of running a full node (if miners made blocks larger and larger, nodes would have to charge miners more $ for the KNBs).
Another idea for "internalizing" this externality would be to 'constantly be trying to defraud everyone'...such that everyone would run a full node out of fear. This is a 'stick' instead of a 'carrot', but it doesn't stop the fact that miners and node operators are different people and have different incentives. People would want to run a node, but not be able to afford to.

Not necessarily, and only if used correctly.


That would indeed be overwhelmingly bizarre, because Bitcoin is a broadcast network, and miners can embed arbitrary data into coinbase transactions which no one can forge or tamper with and which they know all other miners have received. It is hard to imagine a case where Schellings point could apply less!
It is still more ridiculous, because mis-coordination is not permanent and not catastrophic..miners can just watch both versions, and see which version is getting blocks added to it. If they attempt and fail, they've only orphaned a few blocks.

The defining feature of the Focal Point is that it is chosen "in the absence of communication". It is true that it can inform bargaining choices, when communication is cheap talk, but the Core Dev's announcement of a flag day is not at all "cheap talk". Devs have fragile reputations, and can (and have) made commitments which other people expect to be enforced. That they are very conservative about what they say, and what commitments they make, doesn't change the fact that they can make them.


It decidedly *is* of that category. The actual prompt, given to residents of New Haven, CT (ie, not-NYC, so they could *not* validly meet "at their house") was "You are to meet somebody in New York City. You have not been instructed where to meet; you have no prior understanding..." and participants won if they coordinated answers, and lost if they didn't. It was not as though they won $12 if they picked Grand Central and $8 if they picked the Empire State Building.
From [the wikipedia article]( as definitional evidence: **"There is nothing that makes Grand Central Station a location with a higher payoff"**
The example did *not* include a default starting location for anyone (ie, a "house"). The students knew that the other participants were also from New Haven, and presumably, knew that other students knew that Metro North ran from New Haven Union Station to Grand Central in NYC. If the participants didn't know anything about each other, the results might have been the Statue of Liberty or the ESB.
FYI Grand Central 'Station' is a Post Office, not a train station, common misuse.

Ultimately there is an irreducible primary, in the concept of "control". Someone either controls the funds, or they don't. It is either A or not-A. In Bitcoin, "control"="knows the private key".
You are right that cold wallets are more secure, because "not controlling funds" (ie, not loading the private key into any computer) is much safer.
You are right that cyrptocurrency (Bitcoin, Bitcoin-LN, or otherwise) will need to co-vary with large societal changes: individual people will *need* to get better at computer security, if money is going to be on the line *and* helpful third parties are going to be out of the picture. It is unknown if Bitcoin will spur the changes, or they will spur each other, or nothing will happen.
My opinion is that there will be more of a hub and spoke model, at least at first, with hubs being in datacenters with armed guards and highly specialized hardware (append-only logs, self-destructing keys). These innovations are likely to occur faster if hot wallets are being targeted successfully.
So, if you were arguing "I don't want to run a hot wallet, I'm just going to open hubs, pay hub fees (which are likely to be very low, much lower than Bitcoin tx-fees), sign payments on an air-gapped computer, and never rout any payments myself." I would say that that is **certainly** the thing to do *at first*. Let the market specialize and provide security-solutions...LN does, in a sense, reset the "experimental" nature of Bitcoin to some extent. Only a foolish person would jump in LN-hot-wallet-use head-first, just as only a foolish person would jump head-first into Bitcoin in 2009-2010.

Concept of a DAO which manages the pegs is interesting, but probably not viable due to the "who watches the watchmen" concept. Maybe you can think about it more and get back to us with your ideas.

N Taleb claimed that, for Bitcoin to succeed, it must be banned by a few governments. I generally agree; the effects of a formal ban could be either good or bad.
A ban would make it more difficult for the BTC and USD economies to inter-operate. For a tiny BTC economy, it would kill BTC. However, for a BTC economy which is merely "very small", it might have the opposite effect -- a critical group (customers of DNMs, gentlemen's clubs, drug dealers, cybercriminals) might decide that USDs are no longer valuable to them. This might plant the seed of an *entire* economy (supermarkets, rent, babysitting) based exclusively around BTC.
Ie, the exclusion goes both ways. Similar to Taleb's observation that [all drinks in US supermarkets are Kosher, despite the fact that this is only relevant to &lt;0.3% of the population]( a few "dark market only" types can probably flip certain parts of a densely populated city (...and, probably the entire state of Florida...).

Yes. I think it's fair to cite the [Nakamoto Institute]( Blockstream (while each employee is unique, I think it's a safe bet to characterize them all [with this]( Bitcoin Uncensored (see [above]( [Gavin Andresen]( ("sneaky way of exceeding the 21M limit"), and many others. Some developers were "forced out" of Bitcoin for a time, only to return to BTC as soon as possible. This characterizes Warren Togami's Litecoin experience, in my opinion, and it will probably -in time- characterize Ricardo's Monero experience.
In contrast, most who speak in favor of Altcoins, have an ulterior motive. Either they own the Coin in question, or they profit in some other way (Erik's Shapeshift, or CoinTelegraph [which -allegedly- will pump a scam project if you bribe them]).


They do overwhelm, and baffle outsiders. In some ways this is helpful. But, in general, it probably prevents potential BTC-users from understanding Bitcoin's value proposition, and long term sustainability.
When people work on Altcoins, the knowledge they gain, can probably be applied to Bitcoin. But they are learning it slowly - the "hard way".

Erik Voorhees has written a 1,750 word essay response, to an opinion I voiced [in a recent interview]( Comments are locked there.
On Altcoins, Erik agrees with me, that most such ideas are "between horrible idea and outright scam...good riddance". And that I am "right to be skeptical". 
So...what else is there to say, really?
It seems Erik chiefly complains about the generality of my position. He demands that I only dismiss Altcoins individually, "upon examination of their specific attributes".
However, those familiar with my blog know that I do precisely that, with some regularity. Often, people complain that the posts are too exhaustive! I can't win, it seems!
In addition:
1. Satoshi's software is *specifically designed* to prevent more than 21M value-units from being created. The very concept of a "double-spend" only makes sense in a context of a single network.  Erik does not address this *central* point. 
2. Erik brings up privacy as an example of Altchains helping us. However, it is actually a counterexample, as one cited project [is in fact a scam]( Meanwhile, Shufflepuff and TumbleBit seem (to me) [safer and simpler than Zerocash]( Monero is alone in having, temporarily, some merit -- it is the exception, not the rule.
3. There, in fact, is a difference between the Hayekian view that "markets are complex" and a view that "no one should ever have, or express, an opinion about anything".
Finally, it is basic economics that competition is beneficial for consumers, but harmful to producers. I ardently support competition, in all things. However, if a friend of mine started a business, I would make an effort to patronize it, regardless of preference, out of sheer loyalty.
I, *I* would do that. I'm not asking anyone else to do it, but I would do it.
Similarly, if Satoshi visited my house, and asked for food, or money, or whatever. I would give it to him/her/they freely, out of gratitude. (I would hope, even, that my non-BTC friends would offer the same...perhaps, settling up with me later).
From his words, it seems that Erik would throw Satoshi onto the street, and demand that he "compete" for his food like everyone else!

My problem with this is that Monero is the *only* exception. Why even bother using the word "Altcoin"? Instead, say "we currently have a reason for Monero".


Bitcoin already competes with fiat currencies, and their payment networks. Moreover, individual BIPs are themselves in competition with each other.
I don't think innovation in BTC is really affected by Alts. Some take an interest, but most BTC experts are completely indifferent. There was, in fact, BTC innovation pre-Litecoin.

Rogoff proposes a world where money can *only* be used for "approved" purchases.
However, in my opinion, the only reason that people care about their money at all, is because they can spend it on whatever they want. (Or, because they know their trading partner can spend it on whatever (s)he wants.)
If that attribute (ability to conduct illicit transactions) is removed, I would expect people to just stop caring about money. In the limit (if "illicit transactions" were effectively suppressed, everywhere), everything would shift toward barter. Families would do favors for each other, certain individuals would wield social power equivalent to the printing press, etc.

Hello. : )


Glad you liked it!


I think, as far as 'measuring decentralization' is concerned, they are separable: a cheap/expensive network might be very centralized/decentralized. However, are far as "a good payments system" is concerned, they shouldn't be separated: we can and should trade "any excess decentralization we have" for other features, including cheap tx costs.
It's true that the only reason you would run a full node is to receive a payment (that you would later spend), but you might change your payment behavior based on your income and opportunity. For example, a poorer person might batch the payments somehow (by paying their credit card bill with Bitcoin), and someone who can afford to temporarily lose access to their money might use the LN.

Well, it's an interesting question, but my assumption was that there would be no blockreward on the sidechain at all -- only transaction fees.
Miners would ask themselves "Would this technology be good for Bitcoin? (ie, the market price of Bitcoin) " and/or "Would this technology generate transaction fees for us?" (a 'yes' for either would make miners richer), and then they would agree to begin mining it (to give it a try).

I think so, yes. The channel magnitude cannot be increased once opened, and it is preferable to have fewer hops instead of many hops. 
Personally I expect professional LN pseudobanks. You, your employer, all the local businesses are all connected to one hub, and you mostly shift the same funds back and forth.
This topology is often conflated with "centralization" by the ignorant, who mistake LN's "temporary and revokable ownership of some opt-in funds, by one hub among many competing hubs" with "the unilateral ability to print / steal / destroy any money".
One thing weakening this topology, is that the more funds in a given "hub", the greater the motivation to hack it (it will be as problematic as today's exchanges, except only the hub-owner will lose funds, not the users). This discourages larger hubs.

Good for them (?). As blockrewards fall and transactions fees rise, they will eventually stop doing that (?).


I specifically state that my opinion is that there will only ever be a very small number of sidechains. I also specifically state that if the expense isn't worth the transaction fees / value add, the sidechain *should* be axed "nicely".

* As returns from capital investments diminish, miners will compete on operating costs. Many difficulty adjustments later, operating costs will be the relevant discriminant. 
* I doubt that the "water heater" thing will happen. Why would a significant number of people overpay for water heaters?
* Volatility has indeed been high, but will decrease over time. Also, price has never outright halved in a short period of time, *except* in those cases where the price more-than-doubled just before that.
* "Seems like you small blockers [sic]" I'm not a small-blocker.
Sorry that you disagree with Gavin, bitcoin-wizards, and miners representing over 60% of Bitcoin's hashing power, who are are interested in at least discussing this problem (and who don't at all consider it a "pointless concern").

Believe it or not, you can actually bet on Bitcoin's USD exchange rate *in dollars* by going long and short at the same time. It's a little long to explain, but basically if you bought at .25 and sold for .70, the double-bet would be return (.70)/(.25) * (1-.70)/(1-.25) which actually doesn't cancel, and is 1.12 . It isn't quite .70/.25, but these values depend on the scale of the index parameters anyway (what are the max and min...or in this case the divider [600] and in my own project I use log(min) and log(max) precisely to avoid the zeros).
While the returns aren't identical, the incentives are. So people would still continue to buy until the price equals group expectation of X.

Several tech elites had problems (which were pointed out mid-presentation at Montreal in September, iirc) with the "poison transactions" concept, and said that it fails to address double-spends, because, in lieu of "traditional transaction fees", miners can simply publish a Bitcoin address, and then accept transactions "without" a "fee" if they pay to this published address.
The result is that the network appears to consist entirely of no-fee transactions. They note this at the bottom of page 7, and in their follow up. They say it is benign, but they don't seem to see that users can use this to *save* on fees (and that these fees can be paid to either the subsequent leader or the current leader). Absent the coinbase reward, miners can double-spend the microblocks whenever they want, and the poison transaction does nothing. So only the keyblocks are secure, and we're really right back where we started.
In other words, I'm sure it will be adopted by 500 Altcoins and Ethereum.

Yes, if people are using the miners for their heat, they don't really care as much about being on the heaviest chain or optimizing Bitcoin policy. I am skeptical that the miner-heater would ever see widespread adoption.

What I mean is that, within a general smart contracting platform, all participants need to run all the contracts, and any malicious contracts have to either be tolerated or manually filtered. If each smart contract is instead in its own sidechain, you can ignore those you aren't a part of.
You can't run "half a Rootstock" (or maybe you can, I don't really know). I agree it is confusing because Rootstock is both "a smart contract" and "something which allows the creation of smart contracts".

I think is more likely that the 3 pool owners would call each other, attempt to steal the coins, all of the miners who use the pool would freak out, pull out of those pools (and cancel the attack). The pool operators would effectively lose their jobs, and I wouldn't put it past the anarchist Bitcoin community to literally kill one of them a few days later.


They don't have to if they don't want to, but they can only merged-mine on the definitely-longest-(side)chain if they validate (so, they can only earn transaction fees on the sidechain if they validate). As a result, bloated, useless chains would not be well supported here (but that's a feature, not a bug).

I just want to see my ideas tried...one way of doing that would be to make myself the CEO and manage a team myself. But for a couple reasons (legal, not exactly "my style", I fully appreciate how difficult it is to manage people, it is an open proposal and I can't stop people from working on it, etc) I'm doing this slightly weirder thing where I basically outsource the work, then verify it later.
Does that make any sense? I will ultimately endorse whichever version I think is best, and I'll endorse two versions if I think they are both good (or zero if all are bad).
People don't always agree..one disagreement I have with the Augur team sometimes, concerns "the appropriate time to promote/market the ideas" and "the appropriate time to raise money". I think that both promotion and the "VoteCoin auction" should take place after the 0.1 version of the software is finished (ie after most of the work is done).
There will probably be a VoteCoin auction in both variants, which anyone can invest in...but if you only want to use the software, you could just buy Bitcoin (the use-token in both) itself. If you are thinking "How can I profit as an investor from the fact that no one really knows about this yet?", the strategy is probably just to buy Bitcoin. It feels strange to type it out loud, but I think it is clear that, we're this to succeed, it would have an impact on the Bitcoin price.

This is an asymmetric sidechain, and all of the important work-proving happens on the mainchain (both in and out). Since the withdrawals are *on* the mainchain, and only confirm on the heaviest-chain, the proof implicitly proves 100% of the mainchain's total work.


Honest voting is non-subjective because merged-mining allows miners to know what to vote for without requiring any human imput. The only subjectivity is in attacking (just like with regular SPV).
You are right, however, that the Blockstream method auto-validates the sidechain with the most proven work, whereas this one asks the work to make infrequent approvals. However, the consequence is exactly the same, because anyone who controls the work can use it "vote" in both cases.

The thing is, in this example the $600 parameter is fixed, and the market price changes. So I think it would be clearer to avoid "Bitcoin price multiplier", because that will change with the " = .5".
Its actually the case that binary options like these are *worse* (more pointless) than spot markets. As the "real" spot price moves up from &lt;$600 to &gt;$600, the prediction market prices should just flip from ~ 100% below 0% above... to 0% below 100% above.
To see why, imagine that there's no time value of money and all the contracts are priced in dollars and pay $1 if true, $0 otherwise. Say the parameter is something like $700, the current prices say 60% below and 40% above. While this implies that the current market price should be just under 700 somewhere, say that the actual market price is just $300. The strategy is to break a single dollar, and use part to buy the "over cheap" PM price, and the other part to buy or short actual Bitcoin. In this case, take a dollar and spend 60 cents on below (which should really be 100 cents) and then just spend 40 cents on actual Bitcoin itself.
What can we expect to win, if we follow this strategy? If the price is &lt;700, you won your 60 cent bet, and claimed $1 (your original investment), and you still have some money in Bitcoin. If the price is &gt;700, you lost the 60 cents, but the 40 cents you spent on Bitcoin is worth a minimum of 93.333, plus theoretically unlimited upside. But here's the kicker: you know, by definition, that &lt;700 is more likely, so the only scenario where you might *slightly* lose is necessarily less likely than a situation where you definitely win.
tl;dr Cha-CHING!

Yes, you could easily program XT such that it could morph into a mainchain if certain conditions were met, (in fact, it would cause the XT headers to shrink considerably, and the core headers would also vanish completely, so the system overall would actually be easier for lite clients). Before then, people could start new sidechains with pre-morphed XT as their mainchain, and then deprecate all of the originals.

I'm not sure what you mean. Normal transactions, double spends, and sidechain withdrawals, all have confirmations (and indifference to stolen-ness).


The 1m figure is "all Bitcoin miners". If you are assuming that the pool operator takes all of the money, then the "entire pool" has no reason to go along with the operator at all (and many reasons to go against him/her).

Um, what is the game being discussed here? You can't have a NE without a game...that's like saying "it melts at 60 degrees" without ever mentioning what "it" is. Is there a giant blog post about this graphic somewhere?
Whatever the game is, it's really weird:
Why is "switching" to a different implementation (apparently) a best response for some members of a group, but not others? If the players have a hidden distribution of heterogeneous types (which is not presented), is it just assumed that the types will reach the proportions of the final graphic? If so, why are some groups ("Unlimited") switched-to later than other groups (and what is the point of [mis]labeling a mere assumption an "equilibrium")?
Given that nodes of different implementations will ignore each other as soon as their differences become relevant, why would players care about other nodes? The logic of the graphic requires that they be aware of their node share, and/or the node share of rival implementations (as, unless there is more to the game, this is the only information available to them). Yet this is clearly not the case, because no one is willing or even able to *verify* the number of implementations running of various other nodes (because they could easily be faked, as in the case of NotBitcoinXT).
I mean, it just really, really looks like someone who had no idea what they were talking about slapped "Nash Equilibrium" on something in an embarrassingly wrong way. Or there is some genius ESS thing going on, but of course an ESS is specifically *not* a Nash.

You are describing SPV in general. All light clients, and all current sidechain proposals, including this one and Blockstream's, use SPV. In fact, regular Bitcoin confirmations are themselves just "proof of whatever a bunch of consecutive miners say".

Let me clarify.
Competition is good. It is desirable that Bitcoin be *able* to compete with, say, Litecoin. Litecoin should not have a say in Bitcoin's operations, and vice versa.
However, complexity requires interaction of many pieces. Bitcoin has many conceptual pieces (miners, users, software rules). In general, the rules rely on each other -- in some cases, if a single rule (check for double spends) were removed, all of the other rules would be useless. Moreover, rules can contradict each other. In this way, the "addition" of new rules can "remove" old rules.
So, since sidechains / "smart contracts" are an expansion of Bitcoin's rules, Bitcoin needs to have a say in these rules if it is to increase (or even retain) its usefulness.
In short, the "private owners"/administrators of Bitcoin would be more generally effective if they could "own"/control all of Bitcoin's sidechains as well. However, this "teamwork principle" does not change the principle of competition -- The owners of Litecoin should *also* have control/ownership over *their* Litecoin-sidechains.
To use your metaphor: Uber should be able to fire unwanted employees, and Taxi Companies should be able to fire *their* unwanted employees. (The ability to fire someone, makes the hiring process less risky, and helps both prospective employees and employers.) But they should not be able to fire each other's employees.

Mining costs electricity. If Bitcoin revenues won't sell for "enough to cover the electricity costs", miners won't mine.
This isn't something I just made up. Many actual miners think that this will happen, and are just hoping that the exchange rate happens to double at around the same time of the halving (as happened last time [coincidence, in my opinion]).

Well, that's certainly not true "by definition". If all miners run the mainchain software and the sidechain software, 100% of the hashrate will be on both chains. I agree that not all miners will choose to run both, however.


I've been getting this question a lot for some reason. If the fees / value-add to Bitcoin aren't worth it, the miners *should not* mine the chain. I don't have any problem at all with miners refusing to set up something useless.


I think it is clear that, it would be up to the sidechain developer to make this easy for the miners. If he does not do this, his sidechain fails to launch.

PSA: Holding coins on an exchange is always a bad idea, but it is an **even worse** idea to have coins on an exchange *during any network split*.
If you have the coins in your own wallet, you are guaranteed to (eventually) recover your money, whether your preferred fork wins or not. The reverse is true on the exchange...employees on any losing exchange might decide that the company (now) has no future, and it is time to exit scam (and steal the winning coin-types).
Instead, hold your coins on your own wallet for the duration of the split, and then you can deposit them to an exchange immediately afterward.

You're right that a spot market can't completely replace a futures market, but probably not in the way you mean. Futures markets will give you a measure of contango / backwardation, (ie the storage costs and/or convenience yield).
But "the market for Bitcoin" is indeed "a prediction market for the price of Bitcoin". I can borrow $400, use it to buy Bitcoin at the lower 400 price, use that Bitcoin to short 1 Bitcoin's worth at the higher $600 price (and use that cash to repay my loan), and at the end of year, I'll owe 1 Bitcoin and own 1 Bitcoin (which cancels).

Miners sell at today's price. They wait 100 blocks (like 16 hours) and sell immediately. And, as they sell constantly, they have a kind of free "rolling hedge" because they are probably selling an old block at around the exact same time they find the current block.


This is actually impossible. First, it assumes that the Bitcoin price, in purchasing power, will go up forever. But if that were true, miners would constantly overspend such that difficulty would increase. In steady state, "price" would be replaced with "expected price", and cancel itself out. So, in fact, price would need to constantly *accelerate*, a la Minsky-esque Ponzi finance, which is absolutely unsustainable.
A simpler way would be to just separate the accounting, and count 'investments' in Bitcoin as 'sales' to a new account. The only logically consistent way to do this would be to book the sale at the current market price, as I require.

The Ether people got to throw a giant self-gratification party financed by 16 year olds, whilst generally duping and embarrassing all "Blockchain" newbs. In contrast, Rootstock will probably not have the opportunity to throw a giant party.

Lightning is the best thing around. Massive improvements to transaction quantity, as well as transaction *quality* (namely, instant transactions instead of ~1 hour, and vastly superior privacy). Moreover, rebalances power away from miners *and* node operators (gives power to users). Increased network heterogeneity and specialization -- more decentralization, greater diffusion of liabilities.
Thunder is very similar to lightning, of course, so most of the same comments apply. It's unclear when Lightning will be ready, so it's cool to have something we can start using now.

Most of these points are discussed in the article.
One new thing to say is that the title is not clickbait. There are no ads on my blog and I'm not selling anyone anything. Also, I discussed this post's content with the relevant experts, including miners representing half of the network hashrate. Gavin above indicated that this might be a problem in the future, which is the exact thesis of the post.
Obviously I expected r/bitcoin to have a mindless, uninformed reaction to any post that isn't obviously a Bitcoin circlejerk. You are part of that mindless reaction.
Second new thing, you claim that I fail to recognize that Bitcoin has value because it is uniquely useful. It is false (you might read literally anything else on that blog), and actually the reverse: I describe a situation where people want to use Bitcoin but can't, because the block generation process is disabled. I also point out that the problem wouldn't destroy Bitcoin, as someone would reset it (at unknown but plausibly minor inconvenience) in the worst case.
So, your failure to understand the post is almost 100%.

Again, if the fees aren't worth the bandwidth, the sidechain should be deprecated. I believe that miners will deprecate peacefully, and, even if there is risk that they will not, you can AtomSwap with any willing speculators/miners (as I describe).

There is actually a good reason why I said what I said, even though it looks to defy basic 1st year calculus.
Let me explain.
If P(t) = M(t)*V(t) then dP/dt = MdV+VdM as you say.
However, [as I say on Twitter]( "dP" might be interpreted not as [a] the raw change, but perhaps as [b] the percentage change (dP/P) or [c] as a growth factor (dP+P)/P. For example, if X increases from 20 to 25, then dX/dt might be 5, or it might be +25% or it might be 125%.
For the three cases:
[a] "dP" = dP          = MdV + VdM
[b] "dP" = dP/P       = "dV" + "dM"
[c] "dP" = (dP+P)/P = "dV" * "dM" (+dMdV/VM)
The quotation marks denote that it is not really a normal "delta" but instead a modified delta.
My decision to change from the normal delta is (as other say below) a result of my trying to salvage an interpretation of what CSW did. Notice that [a] and [b] have two terms. [c] does have a third term, but Craig is attempting to do something-like comparative statics, or partial differentiation and examining the effect of one variable on P. So one might assume, with some justification, that M and V are independent and therefore that either dM or dV will be zero if the other is unilaterally varied.
Another clue is that CSW states that the money supply is inflating by "about 4%" and then appears to substitute .962 as dM, which is only possible if he uses [c] which would be something like (1 -"about 4%")/1. I really honestly don't know how to make sense of it in [a] world or [b] world.
So, [c] is really the only thing that could possibly have made any sense.
But perhaps it would have been wiser of me to just dismiss it as being total nonsense and not try to salvage it at all.

No, that is not the "given". The word "given" has a specific meaning in conditional probability. If two coins are flipped (say a red coin and a blue coin), you can calculate the probability that the blue coin will be Heads *given* that the red coin was Heads (or, conversely, given that it was Tails). The "given" event will either happen or not happen. Whether someone forces the red coin to be Heads or Tails doesn't change any of the math.


Do you also believe that stock market prices are manipulated by "advertising the means by which they change the conditions influencing the outcome"? If so, can you give us any current examples?

I considered this, but I don't think it actually helps, because the profit maximization is the same whether the reward is 50, 25, or 12.5 BTC (excluding the transactions that are included, it is all "cost minimization" ie "efficiency").
So the profit maximization drives difficulty up and up, right until the moment of the halving (at which point it is too high).

There's a security analysis in the post. Mostly, a fall in the price of Bitcoin (the currency in which they are paid, and which they are currently stealing), and the loss of trading fees on all the sidechains.
A 51% coalition of Miners can already steal 1 million in regular Bitcoin-world...they're paid more than $1 milllion US per day, I believe. So they could just keep 1 day's worth of BTC, and orchestrate a big double spend. It isn't quite the same but, for a useful sidechain, the underlying logic does converge.

Well, I admit I am surprised that you take "outsourced validation" this seriously (other than for the, haha, "permissioned ledgers"). I will look into it more, though, thanks! I *want* there to be a cost to creating a sidechain, to internalize some of the externalities (so that there are fewer for everyone to worry about), and (after the nodes, of course) the miners are the obvious place to land the costs, so I probably would have done this exact strategy anyway, even if I couldn't justify it by saying "It's required".

My pleasure. : )


"be okay with miners refusing to mine some smart contracts" is a pretty close answer. One thing which separates Drivechain from alternative proposals, is that the *Bitcoin* miners can steal from alternate sidechains (previously, if a sidechain were mined using sha3, then the sha3 miners would be the potential thieves -- Bitcoin miners could not steal without creating consensus problems). So my proposal is that "only Discussed Sidechains join the BTC network". By default everything is rejected. My ["fork futures"]( idea could help, in cases where the net benefits of a sidechain are not obvious. (But, I would suspect that they would be generally obvious, similar to the soft fork case).


Let in just [one of these]( and don't let in anything which copies it (or which is abstract enough to allow copies to be built).


Ordinarily, I wouldn't care. But it is now interfering with my work. So, if people have views about "censoring", and they want to bring those perspectives into an engineering conversation, then those views will have to be examined for their truth-content.

Are you assuming this? Because it isn't true either..difficulty would not decline until *after* miners stop mining, and they will not stop mining until the reward halves.

According to my miner friends, in order to merge-mine, one must run a full node to know that the block that one is assembling is a valid one on the heaviest chain. Since I can't imagine secure sidechains without merged mining, it seemed that, indeed, "(some) miners would need to verify the sidechain".


I allow abstention and 'downvoting', specifically to allow the coupling to be weak. Also, the infrequency of the transfers means that there is little to be gained by doing anything other than submitting a valid transfer.


Not sure what this is supposed to mean. Surely you aren't suggesting that, if one fails to pay attention to all of Blockstream's ongoing dialogue everywhere, to the extent that one can reasonably infer what it is that Blockstream would foresee and anticipate, that one has committed an offense requiring an excuse?


I should disclose that I'm almost completely indifferent to **mining** centralization, on grounds of futility...miners will do whatever they want, including delegate administration to a pool operator, and (the whole point of Bitcoin is that) no one can stop them from doing any of that. It is logically impossible for decentralized mining to be more efficient (ie "cheaper") than centralized mining, because a coordinated group can do everything an uncoordinated group can do, and more. So they'll always have motive and opportunity to centralize.
Such was the conclusion I drew, mid-sentence, when I first read about mining in 2011. To me, the secret sauce is not that "everyone is mining", but that "everyone has *the option* to start mining".


The specifics of what? What I proposed only imposes restrictions on what is currently allowed within a block (or so I intended).
Anyway I'm going to sleep but I'll see everyone tomorrow.

If he snaps at the questioner, this allows Craig to Poison The Well (a very powerful debate technique) and discredit her. Is there something *wrong* with the questioner (is she too incompetent to realize that her question is unreasonable, or is she so impolite / does she have ulterior motives such that she is not worth dealing with)?
Secondly, the tension makes people generally uncomfortable. In addition to being a very effective distraction, this context of discomfort allows CSW to conjure up some very strategic ambiguity: *Why* are CWS's claims unproven? Is it because the claims are false and can't be proven, or is it just because this guy has a quirky personality and no **clear** investigation has yet been made?
(Notice that a court wouldn't put up with this kind of misdirection, not for one second. Hence one of my favorite quotes "That's the problem with being clear...sometimes you're clearly wrong.")

I write in the post that fees *might* rise to offset the problem (at which point there'd be no exchange rate effect), however, the opposite scenario is also true, where fees fail to increase and this causes the price to crash.
Interestingly, people who want to sell their btc would only be able to sell by paying high btc fees. This might help, or it might hurt (because who would want to buy such a thing).
What really concerns me is that a speculator can profit by shorting btc, thus moving us from one equilibrium to the other.

My back of the envelope guess is that that could plausibly cost the equivalent of +$10,000,000 US. People are going to want to pass that buck, I think.
Also, someone could deliberately *exploit* this weakness. I mean short Bitcoin right before, and during, the halving. In fact, this opportunity (if indeed profitable) will attract profit-seeking traders (and become self-fulfilling).

I didn't explain it very well, but that was the point of the "automatically disabling TC" slide. It gives the attack something unique to accomplish a single time. Without such a uniqueness, nothing would prevent the attack of the miners from being interpreted as an arbitrary / unquenchable grab for power. (Because it could be repeated again and again, seemingly with no way for anyone to commit to stopping.)
If you look on the slide there is some stuff at the bottom I didn't read...oops.
Edit: I guess a second reason would be the timing. Without the PI environment, miners would have to actively consent to running some kind of (PI-esque) extension block system. The first miner who proposed this (or agreed to it) would probably suffer consequences. Again, if the miners conspired to *begin* the process (arbitrarily and umprompted), the existing community would probably have no choice but to change the hashing algorithm. 
In contrast, with PI, the "setup" of the B2's can be entirely secret, and performed by a single anonymous developer (not an identifiable miner).

"**In the near term, miners are different enough (and the exchange rate is already volatile enough) such that most will survive the halving**, and in the long term, Bitcoin might be sufficiently important such that transaction fees simply increase (in step with the higher confirmation times) to offset the problem. However, in the medium term, namely the year 2020, it is **potentially** disastrous."

I disagree. First of all, I think that the DMMS is half-apple, half-orange.
Second, if miners run upgraded Bitcoin software, and if they run a full node for the sidechain, then there is no subjectivity. The rules they follow are just as deterministic and automated as any other rules. Their software will auto-vote for them and the vote will always be for the correct choice.

We've never observed a situation where a small group of leaders had to orchestrate a hard fork in a short deadline. The factors are all very unusual. For example, the fork was mainly for popularity/social reasons. Normally the fork would fail outright, but since Eth is still very much an unfinished and currently useless project, the devs / researchers are very important.
So, even though it had been discussed, I don't think that we'd ever concluded any "lesson" which could have been learned the easy way. This situation seems highly unique to me.

It is clear that we agree, in general.
The confusion of this case stems from an ambiguous use of the word "added". In Truthcoin "adding a prediction market [to hedge BTC/USD price volatility in another prediction market]" would *only* be interpretable as "adding" another dimension (and not as referring to arithmetic "add"ition).

People keep implying that drivechain requires SegWit...it does not. But DC would be easier to use with LN, which requires SegWit. And SegWit is already polished, so it is first in line for that reason.

Another is that there is no physical location and therefore ambiguous jurisdiction. Third, it is ambiguous is BTC is even money, legally. Etc etc)
I think that you just want to prance around and tell everyone how much you know about traditional banking, and that you really have no idea what is going on in these side-to-main transfers or why the ibanker analogy os helpful to people.

I don't know about "instead" but he does support and push this, just not around here.
Who's your boss and what does (s)he support and why?

Imagine you have a MimbleWimble sidechain, Anyone who runs the MW software will be able to figure out what's going on over there. It will have a list of pending withdrawals...money moving from side-to-main. It will say something like "56 BTC to 1aXYZ, 4.3 BTC to 1aQRY, .006 BTC to 1aJHG". Each of those are "WTs", aka "withdrawal transactions", and they are all put into a big group called the WT^. If you run MimbleWimble, you will be able to see all the WTs and the current WT^. The WT^ is what goes on the MimbleWimble note.
Any miner can put any number of WT^ s on the note (although this intentionally takes up space in their coinbase transactions), but you can only "upvote" one WT^ within each sidechain. So, very quickly there will be only one real contender for this withdrawal period. This contender is what you would readily 'see' on the note...it would be right at the top of the "MimbleWimble note".
These upvotes/downvotes (or ACKs as some people prefer to call them) are done by miners, one per block.
So, to actually answer your question, if the wrong WT^ has the most ACKs, this information would go out to everyone (as a kind of out of band, semi-subjective "fraud proof"), and miners would be expected to instead upvote the correct MimbleWimble WT^. If they didn't know what to do, they could just abstain from all MimbleWimble voting, or downvote everything (these strategies would pause all the withdrawals until people could figure out what was going on). The mainchain would then regard the WT^ as a failed attempt, and the thief would not get any BTC.


Most of my questions these days are from completely uninformed lunatics who select, at random, arcane topics from the fields of economics and investment banking, and then string these together into (somehow) grammatically correct English sentences for me to decipher. So this question is quite refreshing by comparison.

Your knowledge apparently does not contain the commercial paper market. And if you knew the first thing about ibankers you would know that they greedily collect all the fees that they can.

It is possible.
But it is a little more complicated than that. People are more likely to patronize a restaurant that someone spent a lot of money to create...they know that, if the restaurant doesn't maintain a good reputation the owners will stand to lose out, bigtime.
Here is much more information:

I will post the project site [drivechain.info]( because it seems no one is aware of it (nor all of the wonderful information there).
Also, I think people do not realize that the "Drivechain" part of the code has [already been completed]( and we have even also completed [a blank sidechain "template"]( and for the past three months we've only been working on [blind merged mining]( which is also, now, nearly finished.
So, it is very competitive as far as readiness. Recall that the NYC Agreement has a 6 month timeframe...we will almost certainly be fully polished and bug-free by 6 months from now, even if we had to continue working alone. With serious interest / community participation from other helpful people [I won't hold my breath...], it could probably be ready by August 1st (which is, recall, the UASF early timeframe).

People (ETH, XCP, Dash, Ripple) want to imitate Bitcoin's success. It's understandable.
However, I think the emphasis on **features** is misguided. I don't think a coin's "new features" (anonymity, smart contracts, new crypto) contribute to its success. It really is about network-effect (first: marketcap, and second: community) and nothing more.

They can. On the other hand, when people team up (sports, politics, religion) they convince themselves that they "care" about all kinds of "really important" things.

I think that sidechains/drivechain is the most important thing. So please try to educate yourself, and voice your support if you are comfortable.
My hope is that it will direct attention away from scams and fraudsters, and make Bitcoin into more of a collaborative / "permissionless innovation" atmosphere. It would then see less infighting and less scams.
The infighting is directly counterproductive, but the scamming is also very counterproductive as it draws everyone into a zero-sum competition for attention. And many of the scammers get more attention because they [1] have large marketing budgets, [2] are willing to lie / defraud, [3] use the ICO model to create a synthetic MLM scheme, resulting in brainwashed promoters.
Unfortunately, even with drivechain the scamming (and the counter-productiveness) may continue. Which is a real shame, because the scammers are directly perpetuating human misery, around the world (mostly in the form of delayed progress), so that they can pay themselves slightly nicer salaries.

No, it could not.
In the scenario I describe, the ibankers are spending 98 of their M0 in a mainchain account to buy 100 of someone else's M0 in a sidechain account. There is no M3 because there is no loan/credit of any kind, and no fractional reserve.

An interesting thing about Bitcoin is that it give libertarians an incentive to vote anti-libertarian. Bitcoin would have low value if the federal government allowed for private banking, competing currencies, etc. In contrast, high taxes and generous welfare payments benefit smart off-the-grid Bitcoiners. It's quite ironic.

We agree that ibankers are not benevolent, are return-maximizers, and will be aware of the TVM.
However, one cannot withdraw more money from a sidechain than has been deposited into it. Hence, there is a full reserve, not a fractional reserve.

Completely agree with everything that has been said here...I am a huge supporter of RH and prediction markets and will contribute time/programming/money/BTC to help make it possible.
I have lots of ideas so I will be waiting patiently for a community that wants to develop this.
