Both this proposal and the current implementation of ring signatures in CryptoNote coins are O(N) in size (where N is the key ring size), so the overall difference in size reduction is not so substantial. There was a paper a while back that had O(N^(1/2)) ring signatures, and a 'holy grail' in the ring signature field would be O(log(N)) or O(1) sized ring signatures. Either of those seems pretty dubious, though.

As I noted in the thread, this is similar to the block sizing algorithm for Monero and other CryptoNote coins. A quadratic penalty is imposed such that block subsidy = base subsidy * ((block size / median size of last 400 blocks) - 1)^2, with the penalty being applied after you build a block larger than the median size. The maximum block size is 2*median size. Because subsidy is based around the number of coins in existence, the 'burned' subsidy is deferred to be paid out to future blocks.
Unlike Meni's proposal, burned block subsidy is simply deferred to all future miners. So far, this has worked in CryptoNote coins without issue.
I am unsure of the incentives of the rollover fee pool method -- it seems like a way to smooth out and evenly distribute fees among miners, but I'm not sure if it work exactly the way it is intended to. For instance, it may disincentivize the inclusion of some larger fee transactions because the miner will fail to immediately benefit from them, and indeed, if the miner is small and only occasionally gets blocks, may never benefit from them. In this case, fees will end up being paid to the miner out of band, thus defeating the entire fee pool mechanism.

You may want to alter your implementation a bit to add a payment ID, as Luke-Jr seems to be asking you to provide some way of showing ownership of the funds to a merchant. You should allow the user to set the payment ID to whatever they'd like, and could stick it in a tiny output as a pay to uncompressed public key output.

No, not as far as I know. When I say ByteCoin, I mean the very old and knowledgeable user on BitcoinTalk, not ByteCoin the cryptocurrency. It's possible that CryptoNote came up with similar ideas independently.

I can prove that I owned the money to the IRS (which I do; I comply with all tax laws), and prove when I spent it cryptographically. I can't prove where the money came from, but someone else can who owns that private key, and the ledger is public. On the same token, I can't prove where it was sent to, but someone else can cryptographically, and the records are all public. McDonald's can't prove that money for a cheeseburger didn't come from drugs, and frankly, they don't care. A casino likewise dispenses cash and doesn't care where it's going below a certain amount.
There's nothing you can do with Bitcoin that you can't already do, **more safely**, with gold or cash. The problem is not the medium, but helping the government and regulators to understand how cryptographic currencies work and how poorly they actually do measure up to the anonymity offered by their own anonymous currency system, cash. 
The purpose is **not** to avoid taxes, it's to avoid corporate censorship or social ostracizing because of how we spend our money. Clearly, cash has its usages and advantages, such as the privacy afforded for things like the purchase birth control, legal pornography, an abortion, how you spend a loan, escort services (where legal), gambling (where legal), tobacco, alcohol, charities, and politically/socially controversial non-profit organizations like the EFF or ACLU.

Monero (and the other CryptoNote coins) are all using denominated stealth addressing already to address privacy concerns.
The software is still in alpha state, but usable, and we are working on it constantly.  Blockchain bloat so far hasn't been a huge problem, but transactions are indeed larger than with Bitcoin.  
The issue with scanning the blockchain to discover all pubkeys corresponding to you also has not been an issue.  At the current transaction volume, scanning the entire blockchain (when stored in memory) takes &lt;15 seconds.  However, as we move to a database in later implementations (as we can't always keep the entire chain in memory), slowdowns should be expected.  I think this can likely be addressed by allowing ECDH recovery rescans to start from a certain height.  I think Bitcoin would benefit from benchmarking test cases of the usage of stealth addressing to see feasibility in most common situations, as it may not be as severe a problem as it is made out to be.

There already is solid privacy technology available through CryptoNote coins (ByteCoin, Monero, etc), which use mandatory, denominated stealth addressing to obfuscate outputs and ring signatures along with key images to obfuscate inputs.
Amusingly, these blockchains are already much more private than DarkCoin's -- it's extremely difficult to tell just from looking at the blockchain where coins are going or where they came from. Instead, the only thing that's visible is volume. This is because CryptoNote relies on different cryptographic primitives rather than centralized points of failure (like CoinJoin at the level of network selected servers) to afford privacy.
I would say CoinJoin/DarkSend is to CryptoNote what e-mail/Tor Mail is to PGP.
There was no instamine in Monero, either: 
If you want complete anonymity, ZeroCash, which obfuscates everything in the blockchain going down to the coinbase by using a really neat technology called zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge) is also going to be released soon. The downside of this approach is that it requires a large (gigabytes) size parameters set that must be generated and distributed by trusted authorities, and once the chain is operational, it's impossible to observe anything going on inside of it. You can read more about that at  .

Yes -- unless Alice spends her funds to another stealth address and it's also impossible to tell where her funds went. This is why it's somewhat nice to have mandated stealth addressing at the protocol level. I would say that stealth addressing is a kind of forward secrecy, from payer to payee.
CryptoNote coins (Monero, ByteCoin) address this in an interesting way by adding a reverse secrecy component in which all outputs on the blockchain are eligible to be part of a non-exclusionary CoinJoin-like ring signature. By non-exclusionary, I mean it's impossible for anyone to opt-out of being a part of these ring signatures. So, when Alice spends her owned output, she sends them from Bob OR Alice OR Joe OR Cindy's output. This could be included in Bitcoin as a softfork, but likely won't be available until a sidechain comes out that supports it, e.g. the one andytoshi and gmaxwell are working on. For Monero currently you're allowed to spend outputs without a ring signature if you choose to, but very shortly we will be making it mandated that all transactions require spending outputs by ring signatures to prevent the problem of someone revealing that they've spent their output.
You could maybe do this on the Bitcoin blockchain with CoinJoin -- if your CoinJoin implementation was secure. Most of the current implementations, such as SharedCoin, have been dubious. Hopefully in the future implementations will improve.

Unfortunately, it's cumbersome, clunky, and generally difficult to use so far. We had no premine/instamine and so all of our resources expended so far are our own (I myself am just volunteer, I don't get paid or anything, and never have). Thus, development is slow and the client is a long way from being useful in a mainstream sense. Unlike other altcoins that are competing, we also don't use the Bitcoin codebase, and so integration with payment services has been hard.
But, in any case, clearly the technology itself that was used was interesting, or at least, enough for it to garner attention from the Bitcoin core developers: 
So, hopefully some day not too far in the future Bitcoin itself can benefit from this technological development, as it already has from stealth addressing. That, or something more clever will come along. :)
@_date: 2014-12-29 16:12:30
With the current standard, yeah. It's not a well developed protocol atm. It would work extremely well to prevent address reuse if the bulk of users are using it.

Yes, but with the onus of security on the sender and not the receiver. As is clear from recent history, the sender has a desire to keep where their money is going private. Ownership of the address sent to is obfuscated, but the blockchain continues to work as per usual.

Transaction size scales linearly with mixin (number of inputs for Ring signatures), so it's not really an issue; if you want to have greater privacy, you pay more in fees for more space on the blockchain. In the end, you're looking at the size of a normal Bitcoin-esque blockchain multiplied by a constant factor, which isn't so bad. You already have the benefit that all addressing on the blockchain is stealth, so even with mixin = 0 you have more privacy than by default with most Bitcoin forks.
Although, I'll be honest and say there are some issues with the way fees were implemented in the first CryptoNote coin that need retooling and the core team is working on that now. The software (including Monero) is slowly moving out of alpha, and is still a bit buggy, but we're trying hard to add usability to the client and iron out bugs.
@_date: 2014-08-18 19:48:48
Looks like he used createrawtransaction with the wrong decimal position followed by signrawtransaction and then sent it to the network. In that case, any unspent funds automatically go to fees unless you specify it goes to a change address. Sucks for this party.

I'm not sure I follow. I'm certainly not suggesting anyone eschew basic accounting and not comply with applicable laws. Rather, the opposite. Accounting with cash is legal, and likewise, accounting with Bitcoin also is legal. All the circumstances described above were legal uses of cash, for which you would generate a receipt.
@_date: 2014-12-29 01:34:15
Yes. It doesn't obfuscate values sent, so it may be a good idea to denominate transactions in a standard.

Dark Wallet is still active as far as I know. I haven't heard a lot of talk about other implementations recently, but I'm sure if it became a demanded feature others would add it. There are some Bitcoin-QT forks for alts that have added it, like VertCoin's QT client, but hardly anyone using Bitcoin is using the core client anymore.
Stealth addressing is also partially incompatible with the traditional SPV-style wallets (like Electrum) because you need to scan the blockchain to uncover which outputs belong to you. You can sort of address this issue by sending the scan key to another server and having them scan for you, but the problem with this is that this server will know all future outputs belonging to you. Future clients making use of UTXO sets and receiving all tx on the network may be better suited for end use of features like stealth addressing, and are less centralized in general.
Of course, if you're running a service, you can afford to run a full node to receive your transactions too!
@_date: 2014-12-29 07:52:39
The current implementation in Dark Wallet is a little rough and a proper spec for stealth transactions over the Bitcoin blockchain likely requires more finesse. It's possible to hide the extra data inside a small output to a public key or public key hash rather than using OP_RETURN, in case for some reason there's an issue with using OP_RETURN in general.
An ideal implementation of stealth addresses would be:
(1) Indecipherable from regular tx
(2) Able to transmit some additional encrypted information that could be used to ID where the funds are coming from (e.g. you give the user a secret, they encrypt it in another output in the tx and then decrypt that and see what it is)
(3) User friendly
If that's all in place, all you'd have to use is a single address for all users, ever. Unfortunately, you're probably stuck using BIP32 until decent specifications are produced. The benefit would be that you could give users your stealth address and a one-time secret, and they'd be able to send you funds with these two keys indefinitely into the future without you having to give them anything new (as opposed to continuous address creation in BIP32 wallets).
@_date: 2014-12-28 20:30:36
In this case, the receiver doesn't even have to publish their one-time use address and the sender does not need to rely on the receiver to keep their promise to never reuse their address. Rather, the sender generates it themselves, adding more plausible deniability to the receiver, e.g. they could say "I just published my address to the whole internet and received the funds, I didn't even solicit them." As a passive technology, the receiver also doesn't need to be online and interacting with clients to receive new funds, and only needs to store 2x 32 bytes of private keys to recover funds sent to them at ANY future address.
Address reuse should never really occur, but in the case of stealth addressing, it's mandated.
One issue is how to differentiate between persons sending to the same stealth address. I think the solution to this is to likely use the exchanged secret as a key to a symmetric cipher for the sender/receiver to communicate off chain and establish which output came from them (sender sends a signature from the sending output's pubkey encrypted by the shared secret, the receiver decrypts the signature and then verifies it). Such a payment protocol will likely need research in the future to make standard and easy to use for all parties.
An interim solution would be to make an extra tiny output with money going to a non-existent public key which is actually random data, and this data is used to identify the sender by sending it to the sender by another channel. CryptoNote coins do something similar to this called "payment ID", which is an extra 32 bytes that you can fill with anything and append to a transaction, but it's not an ideal solution. This is tech that is implementable today for exchanges, etc., wallet clients just need to be able to generate these transactions using a stealth address.
@_date: 2014-12-28 20:27:07
The easiest thing you can do to protect privacy is use the stealth addressing protocol, which doesn't even require mixing and works passively. Dark Wallet is the only wallet I know of that currently supports this, but hopefully in the future others will.
I made a writeup about it here:

We have a bunch of our own code already and are constantly pushing to it, see
@_date: 2014-05-09 16:16:23
In Monero there is an extra 32-byte field for adding some hash, etc from a server to a transaction to help the recipient identify you.  It is called "payment_id".  So, for instance, if you wanted to move money onto an exchange, the server would generate some random, apparently meaningless data, give it to you to add in as a payment_id, and then when the payment came in, use that to identify that it came from you.
There are some small privacy concerns with this (linkability), and if the recipient exchange wanted to be extremely private they would set up different wallet/stealth addresses for each recipient.
@_date: 2014-12-24 17:10:46
We actually have a web wallet now:
@_date: 2014-12-28 23:01:45
If that becomes really troublesome, you have to encode the extra information in a novel way other than OP_RETURN, e.g. by sending tiny amounts of money to uncompressed public keys that appear as if they were a normal public key or public key hash but are actually the secret data. This sort of stealth send would be undetectable aside from these small valued outputs being conspicuous. Probably an even more clever scheme to avoid censorship could be thought of -- but this is a start.
Policing your transaction outputs must cost CoinBase, etc. a lot of money though, and I think as long as you give them plausible deniability that they can't tell your money went to somewhere that the banks might disagree they'll probably be happy to just leave you alone and profit from your continued business with them.
@_date: 2014-06-03 06:14:06
I've already identified that transaction privacy scales linearly in size, which would mean the blockchain would scale linearly in size compared to bitcoin. So if transactions were say, 300% larger than in Bitcoin, then the blockchain for a CryptoNote coin would be 300% larger than Bitcoin's. That means 60 GB versus 20 GB right now, which fits just fine on a hard drive.
There is no problem that this decentralized ledger system has that Bitcoin does not already also have. At least, in this regard.

ShadowCash is mostly just a reimplementation of the CryptoNote technology using different denominations. We use small, easily verifiable niZKP proofs to prevent double spending via key images for ring signatures, and mandated no-reuse keys by stealth addressing.
Andytoshi/Greg Maxwell are working on a Monero-like sidechain for Bitcoin already:
We continue to communicate with the Bitcoin core devs and cryptographers to improve our software, as they are similarly interested in privacy enhancements to Bitcoin.

So, with stealth it works like this (simplified for clarity):
You (the sender) generate a new address C from stealth address B. You then send the funds you own at A to newly generate address C with some secret information only viewable to the owner of B. The owner of B then uses the secret information to spend the funds at C. To any other observer of the blockchain, it's impossible to tell that address C actually belonged to the owner of address B! Additionally, using B, a person wishing to send funds to B can generate as many new, unique addresses as they want, e.g. D, E, F, G..., none of which can be tied back to B without knowing the private keys for B, and each of which is unique.
An example of B above is this stealth address (which you send your funds to, using the proxy address generated from it, C):
While C (generated by the sender, using the information in B) would be:
from 
**Cryptographically, it's impossible to tie C to B using only the information available on the blockchain.** The funds at A go to the address the sender created, C, but in actuality, C is owned secretly by B.

Totally different technology. ZeroCoin is a total obfuscation layer that prevents anyone from being able to tell who spent what coins that is bogged down by how to make a fast, cryptographically secure niZKP system that doesn't require a trusted (centralized) setup. Stealth transactions use a classical, well known and established cryptographic method (ECDH) to prevent someone from identifying where your money has been sent to.
Stealth addressing is available on the Bitcoin blockchain at this very moment, whereas ZeroCoin has been unable to so far overcome technological hurdles that might allow it to be integrated into Bitcoin.

Thats correct, our block size is dynamically scaled by the size of the previous blocks with no hard limit for the block size. Its been this way since the launch in early 2014. There is also a dynamic coinbase penalty above a size threshold to prevent people from making too large of blocks, too quickly. Gmaxwell and some of the other bitcore developers argued against such a design, saying that it gave too much power to miners to decide the size of the blocks.
