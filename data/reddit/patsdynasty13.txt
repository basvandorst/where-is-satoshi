I’ve always liked the Stratis team because they are trying to improve the entire ecosystem starting with King BTC.

Took me about 10 days to get a response when I initially made this post. Best of luck

Any team that is working to make BTC better is a plus imho

With the new update I'm pretty sure you will be able to hold a 3 coins from coinbase. Get an extra if you want one for a backup, but there are other ways to recover if you lose or break your trezor.

No idea how many are duplicates or fake accounts though, kinda like we don't know the actual amount of ACTIVE coins out there
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:49:05
I'd sell you mine

Be ready for mid September

I think it will go up once enough time passes for people to believe there won't be any bugs
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:42:39
I am just very confused &amp; was looking for some help
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:36:24
In my mind in the next 5-7 years 1 Bitcoin will either be worth a fortune, or something else has replaced it and will be the future of currency

Not you, one of the other commenters on your post. I just forgot to reply to his comment

The market cap would have to be just over a trillion dollars to be worth 500k. Just to make the math easier say bitcoin's is 50 billion right now you can see how far we have to go. Facebook stands at 446.54 billion (stock price - $152.13, around 2.355 billion shares) &amp; about 2 billion users.

I know, I have a trezor, but I was more talking about the smaller altcoins (pvix) as of this moment specifically

Why wouldn't you care about negative sec decision? Absolutely will have an impact on you because it will change the value of your coins. With an a negative decision as is what many people think there probably will be a little dip in the price, but if for some crazy reason it is a positive decision, then we may have a price jump unlike has been seen before. A positive sec decision is the 1st step in this entering the mainstream in America. Next would have some resemblance to what is going on in Japan right now (hopefully). At the very least there would be some legislation coming down the line which would put it in the news even more, no matter what the legislation is (hopefully it would be removing the capital gains tax). 
I'm pretty new to this stuff, but I just don't understand how you could even write that you don't care about what the decision will be? One way or another it will at the very least have a short term impact on the entire crypto market.

Sorry, I know it's off topic, bust I posted on the other subresddits &amp; ive gotten know answers &amp; here someone always answers
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:12:40
I hope you're right
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:19:06
I don't understand why classic grew so much last week? All the news the past few weeks that I've seen was in relation to Eth not classic. Is it just new $ confusing the 2 and just trying to jump on something at a lower price, hoping for a meteoric rise like we had?
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:15:02
Wondering the same thing 
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:33:41
The value of both won't be the same though, correct?
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:35:09
What is the best wallet to safely store XRP in for long term?
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:32:25
Thanks. Last week when I bought another one it was all set in a couple hours. I just got a little nervous when I googled the problem &amp; saw some of the reviews 
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:31:42
I just ran a quick google search and came up with 1.94 billion active monthly
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:21:52
I was actually more interested in the article down bottom about US inflation, raising rates &amp; the weakness of the dollar by the FED this year. More money coming into crypto if they start putting this into action next month
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:40:11
Thanks, that's what I figured, but just wanted confirmation 
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:32:36
Not $70k either
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:33:21
Definitely $ moving
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:53:24
Used to seeing 1-2 come in quick, but not out that quick
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:44:45
Wish I could consider $5-20 million a bargain price, but I get what your saying 
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:00:12
Definitely not a veteran
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:01:05
Everything just dropped like crazy
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:01:59
I understand that. Just getting ready for the bounce back up
