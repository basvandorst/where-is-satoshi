If only I had known about BTC in the early days. I'd be sitting in a mountain ad well! Now, not so much.

I used to live in Argentina and I've never seen or heard if such a thing. Why would the Argentine people need to buy dollars? Hardly anyone ever accepted them! It's been a while so maybe things have changed dramatically.

Thank you!

Late 90s/early 2000s when you could still exchange about 1 to 1. It was rare that I could spend USD and people often looked at me like I was a moron if I asked.

I finally get what the hell MtGox stands for! Magic the Gathering online exchange!

I guess this makes more sense. I lived there when the peso was a lot stronger.

I did with my most recent purchase of gold. I also pay my VPN with BTC but you didn't ask that.

OP, you alive?

6 hours later and there are still just barely over 500 comments? That doesn't seem right.

What's going on in here?

Had a similar experience at a food truck. I was excited to use bitcoin out in the world but the app didn't work for whatever reason. Fortunately I haven't had any bad experiences paying for things online with bitcoin.

Good to see Sean's Outpost still on this list.

Couldn't tip here but I sent a bit to said address. I've been meaning to donate for a long time but I guess it takes Santa to get your butt in gear.

I wanted to go by this morning because I was going to be in the area but they don't open until 4! Everything in Austin opens and closes and stupid times.

I've only recently started coming around to the idea of having Bitcoins as an alternate currency instead of purely a investment to hold on to. We'll see where this goes though.

We're you buying and selling? Right now I've just been buying and Wellsfargo hasn't said anything to me but I have more than my own account to worry about there. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:08:19
What makes you say that Bitcoins will have a future value if millions? Genuinely curious.

50/50 split?
Sorry, n00b here.

OP, I don't think a lot of people realize what you mean by, "remember to pay the tax-man". Could you please explain what you meant by this, 'cause it seems a lot of people here are advocating jail time.

It's it possible that Bitcoin will usher in the era of the trillionaire?
@_date: 2013-10-30 01:03:37
If you're in the US may I suggest cashintocoins.com. I used them recently and I was very happy with their speed and customer service. Great, now I sound like a bot. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:59:44
If they don't like it, I'll take one!

Maybe don't think of it as missing a train. The $200 exchange rate is a bit daunting. Hell, I bought my first mBTC when the price was $140. If you're looking for an alternative in an effort to get rich, try Litecoin but don't see Bitcoin as a means to get rich anymore, see it as an alternative currency.
You might not get rich but the value of the currency will keep growing, in my humble opinion, as businesses start adopting the platform. It could lead to a shift in how we do business across the globe. Bitcoin is still young and getting in now is still getting in fairly early. Like others have said, you'll probably be saying the same thing about price next year. 
Lastly, Bitcoin is still volatile so invest only what you can afford to lose. I've seen people suggest that people should invest their life savings. That's nuts. Even if they come out as millionaires in the end, it was a pretty big gamble to begin with. 
Have fun and come join the rollercoaster even if you're only investing $20. That's how many of us started.

I can see this turning into, "Random Acts of Beer!"
Wait, can I buy the hottest lady in the bar a beer? Or even the most down on his luck guy? Is this place even open right now?

Those are still around?
