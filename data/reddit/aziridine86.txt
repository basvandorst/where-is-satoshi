For someone with little cryptography experience, can you give us an idea of what would be required to crack this? 
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:57:18
Oh I was thinking the difficulty would decrease by 2^4 for some stupid reason. Whereas it actually decreases by (char set size)^3 IIRC
@_date: 2014-03-22 19:06:11
Yeah. The technology exists to actually tell you the strength of the pill in a portable format as well, its just not cost effective.

Well there will always be slang. But for MDMA, there are slang with different meanings, e.g. Molly and Ecstasy are both slang but mean different things. 
Its kind of equivalent to this: I could say I have oxycodone for sale, but that could mean a lot of things, Percocet pills (5 mg oxycodone + 325 mg acetominophen) or Oxycontin (20, 40, or 80 mg sizes, among others), or even OxyNorm oxycodone solution for injection or pure oxycodone hydrochloride powder. So drug dealers and users need terms (usually slang like 'roxies' or 'OC', etc) to differentiate these products, even though they all contain the same active ingredient.

If the pass phrase decreases in length by three characters, the search space decreases by char set cubed. Are you going to try to say that's not true?
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:11:22
Lol. I was gonna say, I knew all the things he said, but I never knew it actually had the world 'unreliable' in the name of the protocol.

If you go from one character to two characters, the number of possible combinations is increased by a factor equal to the size of the character size, right?
A 2 digit numeric code has 10 times as many possibilities (and 10 times the time to solve by brute force) as a single digit.
Going from 1 character to 4 characters increases the possibilities by 10 x 10 x 10 (from 10 possibilities to 10,000 possibilities). Thus the number of combinations increases by the cube of the character set size when you increase the length of the password by 3 characters.
My point was that even a single UTF-8 character (allowing all 1.1 million possible "characters") would still take more than a day to brute force if cdm9002 is correct that 7 tries/second is a reasonable rate for BIP 0038 on decent hardware.

The US Dollar has a serial number, and that doesn't stop anyone from using it buy their cocaine or child prostitutes.
But I have no idea if such a blacklist is implementable.

Well if they did file reports and are conducting an investigation, then they need to say so, and not just say "were going out of business, sorry".

Depends entirely on the state of the connections/pathways between you and the other computer. Sometimes it will be perfect (data is only going a few 'hops' over good connections/routers that aren't overloaded) sometimes it will be poor (e.g. if you try to send data from the US to China over congested links).

Yes. Why don't they force a minimum transaction fee by default? This video is seriously bad PR.

He's not wrong. Even for the best artists, they have to pay-to-play if they want major rotation on the radio, even though its illegal AFAIK.

Well MDMA is a compound, but when you buy Ecstasy pills, you can get many things. 
For example, if I get a pill that has 80 mg MDMA, 20 mg MDA, and 10 mg ephedrine, did I take MDMA? Yes but I took other things too, and of course I don't actually know what I took unless I get the pill tested, so I think it is easier to just call it 'Ecstasy'. 
If all Ecstasy pills were just MDMA, we wouldn't really need the term Ecstasy or the term 'Molly'. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:49:52
Right, so a 4 digit UTF-8 character passphrase has (1,112,064)^3 more combinations than a 1 digit UTF-8 character passphrase, right?
Maybe I wasn't very clear, but that was my original point. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 23:00:22
I see.

Others indicated that the coins were linked to him earlier today.
Does seem likely it could be a troll attempt but perhaps still worth spending a day or two on just in case (and helps build better cracking skills for those involved).
If the coins aren't gone in a week or two its safe to say he lied about the password. Or maybe everyone will just give up first.
But the search space isn't all that huge really, depending on the definition of 'recent'

Looks amazing.
"i must say i had a great experience with these bitcoins."
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:07:39
The question wasn't how many more possibilities are there (which is charsize^4 minus charsize^1), it was the factor by which the search space increased/decreased, which is charsize^4 divided by charsize^1 which equals charsize^3.
But maybe it's my fault for not making that clear upthread

Basically. Ecstasy are pills that you buy that when a dealer says "these are Ecstasy". You hope they contain MDMA or MDA, but they could contain nothing at all or a mix of things (e.g. caffeine, ephedrine, methamphetamine, ketamine, TMFPP, BZP). 
I guess if the pill contained just meth or caffeine, it wouldn't be 'Ecstasy', it would be 'Fake Ecstasy', but I think a pill that contains 100 mg of MDMA and 20 mg of methamphetamine would still be considered Ecstasy, whereas MDMA is just MDMA, if that makes any sense.

Often behind the counter but mine has it out in the open. It prints a secure ticket that you take to the teller in order to deposit or get cash. 
But if its behind the counter you don't have to worry about fraud.

Still, if he just wants to pull out say a few hundred BTC every couple of weeks (which is still a ton of money), would that be feasible?

Excellent point. People wonder how the Titanic happened, there were lots of factors (with hubris and selfishness being involved to some degree as well) that combined together. 
Also, the Titanic was something of a black box to passengers, AFAIK they didn't know that they were going too fast or taking a dangerous route or that the rivets were poorly made or that the water tight compartments weren't really watertight. They believed the promises that were made to them about the safety of the ship.

That depends on what definition you use to quantify risk.
Maybe you are into risk management, but the average person doesn't visualize risk as a probability of something occurring, they consider 'risk' to be the probability of loss times the degree or size of the loss. 
If you asked most English-speaking Americans "is storing 1 million dollar in my mattress more risky than storing 1 dollar?", they would say "Yes". (Aside from the fact that more money draws more attention)

Or have a fee included by default (or even forced). I think they would be better off forcing fees then losing customers to the bad PR this creates.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:27:58
Ok thanks. I guess OP needs to use a smaller character set. I take it that even a single Unicode character would be uncrackable if it works like I think it does (7/16 quadrillion years?). 
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:34:02
Others on the thread suggested that you could potentially use an unassigned code point as your 'character', perhaps that's not true, I don't know. I know people tried to get OP to clarify if the passphrase was restricted to ASCII or to Unicode or what, but he refused. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 11:41:16
Perhaps found in a ditch with evidence of torture? If he really had access to that kind of money, that would make him quite the target I would think.
