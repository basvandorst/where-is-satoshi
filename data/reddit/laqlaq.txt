A sandwich has intrinsic value. It can feed you. Currency has value because governments have promised they will accept it as currency. Stocks have value because they are shares in companies that generate actual economic value. 
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. At all. It has nothing to back it up, at all. 


You are buying literally nothing.

Rebound based on what? bitcoin has nothing to back up it's value. Nothing at all besides what the next dude down the line will pay for it. 
Company stocks have actual earnings and revenue to drive a rebound. Fiat currencies have the backing of governments and financial policies to help them rebound. Bitcoin has the hope of people who put money in it.
