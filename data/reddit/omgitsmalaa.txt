It's phishing, and possibly one of the biggest scams ever. Their app advertises as a "BTC wallet" but Bcash is enabled by default, and when you want to send your coins, it uses Bcash unless you click on a small icon (will reset if you restart app). Those are the facts. Roger Ver should be in jail for defrauding people. He's already committed crimes, so he'll do it again and again.

It dropped by $500, but recovered somewhat

Isn't our goal to decentralize value and make it as easily accessible as possible? Given a statistical population, there will always be a certain % that will be misled. We shouldn't allow that.

You have to realize that it's no longer nerd money. As more non-tech people get bitcoin they'll have no idea about the different forks/scams going on. We shouldn't allow this obvious scam happen.
You don't have to understand how an engine works to buy a car -- in the same fashion,  you don't have to understand how BTC works to buy it. But now it's like we're having a counterfeit dealership in front of the legit one, which, unless you know about cars, have no idea about!

Your private keys are your keys to your coins, and you don't own them if you're on an exchange. If they get hacked, RIP your coins (has happened). If you have &gt;$1000 in BTC, get a hardware wallet (ledger/trezor) and print your 24 word seed (aka your keys) and lock them up in a fireproof safe, and another copy in a bank vault. You can also setup multisig for even more security in case someone gets your keys.
Then have smaller sums ie &lt; 1000 in a mobile wallet for convenience. Check out the sidebar &amp; research which option would suit you best.

BCH wallets created by default but uses "Bitcoin Wallet" in title! It's misleading! We shouldn't allow an alt coin steal property of BTC.

You're missing the point. Bitcoin != Bitcoin Cash. We shouldn't allow a fork to mislead people.

Water isn't trademarked either, but if you tried selling alcohol as water, you would be in big trouble. 
Apple will realize what's going on and remove the app.

Just contact apple. With enough attention they'll remove it immediately. (see link in my other comment here)

Inflation != harm. Central banks have an inflation target to keep the money rolling in the economy. That's why the deflationary bitcoin has a majority of hodlers, because why would they spend their coins if they'll be worth more tomorrow? Deflationary policies actually harm economic growth by reducing the overall amount of investment and activity. This is what happened in Japan - people stopped buying stuff. A centralized bank can also provide stability through its foreign currency reserves: a crypto like volatility would be devastating for international trade.
Unless a BIP comes through with a solution to how easy it is to lose your wallet, cryptos can only be a "supplement" instead of going mainstream.

You clearly missed the point. Let me clarify it for you: you can lose your wealth immediately for a variety of reasons and not get it back.  Neither did I suggest a solution - just putting things into perspective given the recent "banks are scams" circlejerk. Your average joe doesn't use 2 factor authentification through an authenticator app (not SMS codes!) with backup codes printed, not screenshot. Even if he does use SMS codes, it's easy - even for kids - to call AT&amp;T with cryingbaby.mp3 in background and requesting a new SIM card copy which he can then proceed to access all your stuff. Your average Joe is going to google bitcoin and see "AD: blockchain.wow" and get his wallet/coinbase phished.

This is just absurd - truly they can't convert my BTC to B2X? I don't get how they can force the alt down everyone's throat without getting sued (class action)? How come there isn't a greater outrage &amp; campaign about this?
