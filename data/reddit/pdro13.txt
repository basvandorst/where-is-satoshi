What could have caused today's small spike??

This time you could take that guess but the previous events didn't involve bitcoin as long as I'm concerned.
@_date: 2014-12-03 05:29:35
Are you seriously comparing the market to a control system? I've been trying to look at it from that perspective for months but just can't make the whole analogy fit in. I'd like to hear more
@_date: 2014-12-25 19:31:48

You read my mind XD

There are much much less black engineers in the world... For some reason
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:42:32
I've been thinking about this for months!
Consider this additional scenario, what if you're kidnapped and forced to give them your keys?

@_date: 2015-03-09 18:43:31
I didn't trust him, had to try it, no luck :(
@_date: 2015-03-04 01:59:24
Can't find it funny, I can't pay attention to the subtitles cause I understand spanish :(
@_date: 2016-05-12 16:02:44

@_date: 2015-10-12 17:36:59
Mexican here. That's cool but I'm sure not even 0.001% of the people who would buy from FAMSA know what bitcoin is, or even worse, how to use a computer :/
@_date: 2015-11-25 18:34:52
