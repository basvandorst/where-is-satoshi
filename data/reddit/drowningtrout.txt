Everyday my friend. 
I didn't mean to insinuate they don't enjoy it, I wish good teachers earned more, it's an investment in all of our futures.
From my anecdotal experience, the public education system in the US is atrocious. Essentially daycare for the working class. If we paid them more maybe we'd get better educators/results.
Edit: I encourage everyone to do what they enjoy and I admire those who enjoy education. But the no child left behind and problem kids hurt everyone.

Hey just wanted to say yes, gifts are tax free (as the reciever) , but if the gifted asset appreciates by the time you sell you still owe capital gains on that amount.

Do yourself a favor and pay the taxes. I don't agree with the allocation of government funds either, but it is what it is. You'll end up paying more trying to avoid it.

It is based on the cost of energy, so yes it does have intrinsic value. But the current value exceeds the mining costs, but that doesn't mean the valuation is wrong.

That's sucks, bad travel experiences are never fun. But it sounds like your negative experience was due to airbnb not buying gift cards with bitcoin.
That said, personally I love airbnb. I've  never seen an airbnb that isn't much less than a comparable hotel.
I've had one issue with an airbnb host but was able to book another one immediately within the city.
Also vrbo is a great option.
All anecdotal experiences on my part, but there's many discounted giftcards/services that can advantage of by arbitraging bitcoin.
Best of luck and safe travels going forward!

The tweaker at my door didn't have a gun, just uninhibited drug fueled rage while talking nonsense. Pretty scary at the time, I've also been "robbed" at gun point on my way home from a bar.
The USA and Australia do not have the same culture, surely you know that.
@_date: 2018-10-19 15:06:01
You're right, I was mistakenly looking at gun murder rates in Hawaii which is 0.5/100,000 with 45% gun ownership.
Still I think the comparison between USA and Norway is unfair.
To start the USA has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Almost 10x that of of  Norway and more than 70 percent of freed inmates are re-arrested within five years.
Prisons conditions in the US are borderline inhumane compared to Norwegian prisons (or in general). Their focus is not on rehabilitation or reintegrating people back into society. Very hard for anyone with a record to get a decent job, so back to crime and prison it is.
The FBI in 2014 stated that there were some 33,000 gangs in the US compared to Norways, 5?
The US is known to have one of the worst drug problems in the world with the highest demand. Over 10% abuse prescription drugs alone. Heroine has become an epidemic in recent years and other hard drugs are steadily increasing.
US demographics are diverse, cultural melting pot with polarized religious and political beliefs. Huge socioeconomic divides.
The education and healthcare systems are broken and pathetic. Medical bills are the biggest cause of bankruptcy.
Also tons of veterans coming back from pointless wars with PTSD and other mental issues, many who end up on the streets.
In my opinion comparing the US and Norway is like apples and oranges.
Let's focus on the underlying issues instead of taking honest people's guns. Personally, I felt better having my gun in hand while a tweaker tried to break down my door at 2am.
@_date: 2018-10-20 08:48:09
Haha that's not how the castle doctrine works.

@_date: 2018-10-19 09:24:45
Of course there's still crime, guns aren't meant to eliminate all crime.
A firearm is simply a tool to defend you and your family.
The USA does have some sates such as Hawaii that have high gun ownership and similar murders rates to Norway.
Texas has a much higher population than Norway and is in a large geographically dangerous area by bordering Mexico. Drugs and gang related violence account for most murders in the USA. The USA has a very different culture compared to Norway, murder rates go way beyond simple gun ownership.

If you still haven't figured it out, send me a message. 
Download electrum wallet, click open wallet from file. 
I can talk you through it in the phone if  need be. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-08-19 12:18:29
You don't understand.
The *****.dat file is your wallet backup, only you control this. That's all you need to access your funds.
Coinbase and bitbargain have no control over it.
You may have bought from bitbargain, but once it was transferred to your personal wallet they have no control.
Listen, all you need to do is go to electrum.org download the wallet, run it, it will ask for your ******.dat file. Bam that's its. Quit messing with bitbargain and coinbase.
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:51:50
Yes, just send to the trezor address. Make sure to write down your backup mnemonic seed whenever you setup your new trezor.
Did you successfully recover?
@_date: 2019-08-18 17:52:04
That's why I included instructions to recover.
Have you restored your wallet?
If you're worried about scammers, don't give anyone your wallet.dat file or download unofficial software. Once its restored you'll be able to see your mnemonic seed (12-24 random words) this is your private key, don't tell anyone what it is. Obviously don't send anyone your funds.  These are the only things you need to worry about.
To recover from wallet.dat is extremely easy, download electrum wallet from official site. Select restore from file when prompted. 
Let us know how it goes.

@_date: 2019-10-16 21:06:13
This is close, I'd say leave instructions in your will to locate the seeds for your crypto wallets. 
The crucial part is to split your mnemonic seed up into 2 or 3 parts. Keep each piece in a safety deposit box at different banks, preferably in multiple jurisdictions. 
Although this could be overkill and a little costly to keep subscriptions to 4-6 safety deposit boxes all over the place.

@_date: 2019-08-19 20:30:32
Yes you do, don't listen to these idiots. 
For small purchases you're probably fine, slip through the cracks. Technically in the USA you owe capital gains on all gains. It's exactly the same process for buying/selling gold, stocks or anything else.
Say you buy $1000 worth of bitcoin and it jumps up to $3000. You'll owe capital gains on the $2000 gain, 15% capital gains tax bracket for most people, you'd owe $300 for taxes.

Your both wrong, although depends on the wind turbines. 10 years is about right for utility scale installation.
The real reason is due to multiple electric providers in Texas and being able to leverage thst to have very cheap electricity in non-peak hours. Can switch back and forth, depending who has cheaper electric.
Miners dont need to be air conditioned just ventilated.
Also Texas is doing more solar now (cheaper/consistent), there's still tons of wind turbines but many future wind projects are moving offshore. See  general electric haliade-x turbines

Your right, I don't literally think all yang fans have zero economic knowledge. I just can't phathom how any economists would approve of his policies.
Specifically UBI, $1k/month for every adult would cost $3 trillion annually.
Yes, I understand it would replace the existing welfare programs, which we currently spend $1.4 trillion on. He will add at 10% VAT tax to raise $600 billion.  That leaves us with $1 trillion deficit...every year. 
For some people $1000 a month isn't enough to substitute all the welfare programs they're receiving. (Food stamps, hospice, medications, treatments, housing) 
His plan would devalue the dollar and hurt the very people he's trying to help.
@_date: 2019-09-05 01:51:23

No dude... I don't play bi-partisan games I'm a conspiracy/BTC nut. In general I tend to support leftish social policies and rightish fiscal policies. 
I don't agree with all subsidies (oil), and definitely think that agriculture subsidies could be reduced. Renewables are tapering off. It doesn't have to be one extreme or the other. Some subsidies are a good thing. I did give a reason, subsidies stabilize the markets (commodities/futures), which benefits everyone. 
I also think BTC will take over, but you must not understand subsidies if you don't realize they would be unaffected.
@_date: 2019-09-18 07:39:44
It didn't deviate from the white paper tho, satoshi specifically said second layer solutions may be needed.
Anyone can develop for bitcoin, it's on github. It's getting consensus that is the hard part, and why we ended up with so many bitcoin forks.

I also have an economics degree and don't rely on the appeals of authority fallacy to make decisions. (Wouldnt have been an early crypto adopter if I did)
I've already seen those videos and familiar with his plan. 10% VAT tax would bring around 700 billion annually. (I actually like VATS for other reasons/circumstances)
Yes, he wants to consolidate existing  welfare plans, which currently total to 1.4 trillion a year. His UBI and healthcare plan would be 3 additional trillion a year.
Please specifically tell me what faulty assumptions I'm basing this on.
@_date: 2019-09-15 19:15:58

Yang's UBI would cost 3 trillion, plus at least an additional 1.5 trillion for healthcare. 4.5 trillion for those two things, federal revenue is only 3.4 trillion. 
Yang's plans would decimate the dollar. Bad for the dollar, but good for BTC.

Yes, there's a bipartisan effort to devalue the dollar 15-20% over the next 5 years. If you check my post history I've been saying that 2 weeks ago.
Subsidies are not welfare queens, agriculture and energy subsidies are very important for economic security. People who say farmers are welfare queens have no clue.
I shouldn't have said devalue, I meant destroy. Because the dollar is already planned to be devalued, but yang's plans would destroy the dollar within 10 years.
Edit: and what about people where $1000 a month isn't enough to cover their medical expenses, food stamps, subsidized housing?

Hardware wallet is a great idea, keep your coins on there whenever your not actively trading. You want to minimize the amount of time your coins are sitting on an exchange. Also be careful which exchanges you use, many are not trustworthy.
@_date: 2019-05-30 20:44:51
Yeah kinda. 
When you keep coins on coinbase you're trusting them as an custodian with your funds. If you don't have the keys its technically not yours. Which kinda defeats the whole point of bitcoin, to be trustless (not rely on custodians).
Although for practical purposes and for low amounts coinbase is the best custodian to choose if you must do so.
Also the coins arent stored on your harddrive , the coins are on the blockchain, your keys let you access them. If you have your keys written on paper you can always recover your coins.

Most privacy coins are pre-mined pump and dumps.
Swap (xwp) has no pre-mine or dev fund

Paxful and localbitcoins.
I recommend paxful.

Ok, so I'm the only one going to do this... let me defend the SEC as someone who's be in frequent contact with them regarding STOs. 
I have to give the SEC credit, they've been way more receptive to crypto than I ever imagined they would be. (Old school hodlers back me up)
This is still the wild west and crypto falls outside the usual formula for ETFs. It is coming but have some patience, they have a process.
You should all know, government agencies move at a snail's pace. Anyone who works in the sector can attest to this.
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:02:39
Its usually a bad idea to use bitcoin ATMs they have terrible fees due to overhead. They still require KYC. 
Much better off using cash app then transferring coins to a personal wallet that you alone control.
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:31:43
You're literally the only person who doesn't acknowledge bitcoins decentralization. And I'm the ignorant one?
Pretty arrogant for you to think you know better than everyone else.
Please do give up and stop posting in cryptocurrency threads about a topic you don't understand. Spreading misinformation nonsense.
@_date: 2019-05-30 19:51:10
Rule number 1 of crypto (you'll see this posted a lot)
"Not your keys, not your coin"

Should be fine, cant think of reason it would add any risk.
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:37:19
No no and no. "Such a simple concept" and you still fail to understand it.
Bitcoin is a decentralized protocol.
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:39:53
I thought all BTC ATMs are required to have KYC, in the USA.

You really don't need much in your 20s, assuming no kids, no mortgages, minimum car payments, possibly parents insurance, Splitting rent/bills with some roommates.
You can and most people do rough it through their 20s.
I've held BTC through most of my 20s and haven't really touched it, and believe me the temptation was there to sell my bags and ball out. Seriously I put up with some nasty shit. Now that I'm settling down with a girl and looking at houses life gets a lot more expensive around 30.

As others have said there's no way of knowing if the wallet it came from was a one-time-use wallet or a custodial wallet for an exchange. The best course of action would be to post and wait for someone to come forward who could sign a message linking the address confirming it was them who sent it.
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:04:01
Dont be surprised, we're hella up from a few weeks ago.

You obviously don't keep up with geopolitics.

Use Cash app to purchase bitcoin (I believe the lowest fees?)  then transfer to hardware wallet/cold storage or use a DEX if you plan on trading.

Decentralised system
A decentralised system in systems theory is a system in which lower level components operate on local information to accomplish global goals.
Yes very different. Protocol, in computer science, a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices, such as computers. In order for computers to exchange information, there must be a preexisting agreement as to how the information will be structured and how each side will send and receive it. (Ex. Http how you're reading this)
The terms people are throwing around are computer science terms.
By your definition of decentralized, it would be impossible for any cryptocurrency (protocol) to be decentralized, because all protocols (computer science) require rules on how to exhange infromation.
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:29:00
In computer science terminology bitcoin is decentralized. Meaning the integrity of the blockchain is not upheld by a single entity or central authority, the only rules are the rules of the protocol. 
Before blockchain, ledgers/databases were vulnerable being hosted on small systems. (Malacious hacks or accidents)
Miners all over the world, verifying the integrity of the genesis blockchain is what makes bitcoin decentralized in computer science terms.
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:32:27
A consensus is not a single entity.
A single entity does not control bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:53:48
I'm always open to learning new things, but you have nothing to teach. Yes, I will side with everyone else by saying bitcoin is decentralized.
Yes, I do think I know better than you. As I've been involved in computer science my whole life, an early adopter of bitcoin and soley do this for a living.
Disagreeing with one individual is not as arrogant as challenging everyone elses beliefs.
Take your own advice and learn what decentralization really is.
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:57:59
As someone who felt like they had very little 7 years ago... I highly recommend holding. My only regret is not holding more for longer, never selling again. I'll take out CDPs when I need the physical cash and repay when BTC appreciates.
Best of luck my friend.
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:36:10
Thanks for the thoughtful response. :)
Edit: I suggest you consider what Israel wants, which holds more weight than the Russians.
@_date: 2018-12-20 18:57:15
No it isn't. 
Do you know what an entity is?
Your definition of decentralization is also incorrect.
@_date: 2018-12-19 22:29:38
A single entity does not control Bitcoin. How do you not get this?
What do you mean create a bitcoin? You can't just create bitcoin at all, its only from block rewards for solving a block. You wouldn't be kicked out and thats not how hard forks work.
The protocol is open source and decentralized. Please read more to understand how computer protocols work, as this is obviously not your area of expertise.
Edit: "There is no single entity that tells all the different currencies how to generate and allocate their numbers in currencies as a whole."
By your logic: All currencies follow Math rules therefore they are centralized.
@_date: 2018-12-19 18:44:01
The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology.
Bitcoin is a blockchain system that cannot be altered by any one entity (decentralized). It also runs as a peer-to-peer network of independent computers spread across the globe (distributed).
@_date: 2018-12-19 19:43:11
In a centralized system, control is exerted by just one entity (a person or an enterprise, for example). In a decentralized system, there is no single controlling entity. Instead, control is shared among several independent entities.

At $550 million it probably had a ton of inputs. More inputs = higher fees.
You can send a BTC transaction for a few cents at the moment. (Low priority)
@_date: 2019-05-31 22:38:22
Use a different wallet and set fee as 1sat/byte.
You can currently send a transaction for a few cents, it will take about a day.
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:45:58
"Currencies as a whole are decentralized, as every one of them has it's own rules. But each one must be centralized, as otherwise it would not be a currency. If I can just make Bitcoin using whatever rules I want, and you can make Bitcoin using different rules, that you choose, then there is no single currency. No single Bitcoin system. Which is why I said that folks who call Bitcoin centralized are confused, and probably are thinking about the fact that Bitcoin is public, global, and anyone who has the resources and interest can participate in helping run the game, as opposed to games run by private corporations and national governments, where only hired or elected individuals are allowed to run"
I have no idea what you're trying to say here. They all have their own rules?  Make bitcoin with whatever rules? What rules are you talking about? Thats not how it works.
People are confused that bitcoin is centralized? I don't think so. Typo?
Yes, bitcoin is an open source, distrubted decentralized protocol.

It's a way for people to circumvent embargos/tariffs/trade wars.
Why do you think North Korea owns so many?
No authority can stop you from transacting and you dont need to trust any intermediaries.
