15 - Who is your favorite author?
Roger - Without a doubt, Murray Rothbard. I remember reading his books in my youth and feeling afraid to continue because of the irrefutable logic being laid out that would forever change the way I viewed the individual’s relationship to governments.
War is mass murder.
The draft is the moral equivalent of kidnapping and slavery.
Taxation is theft on a grand scale.
I implore anyone who wants to understand the world more clearly to read his books.
16 - Do you get hassled when travelling through U.S. airports?
Roger - Everyone gets hassled in the USA, on the way in, and way out.
As I type this, I’m on a flight from NYC to HK.
On the way into the USA, the first person I met was a stranger with a gun on their hip, threatening myself and everyone else to show them ID. If you aren’t convinced that they are threatening you, the next time you see them, try ignoring them and walking through to your destination and the threat will become very clear.
To depart the USA this morning, I had to deal with numerous security checks. I had to strip off a substantial portion of my clothing, and most invasively of all, there were strangers with guns waiting on the boarding ramp to the airplane threatening everyone to show them their ID, and tell them how much money they had with them.
Most people don’t travel internationally so they don’t know, but the USA is one of the very few countries where the customs agents are so militarized that they actually carry guns with them.
In Japan for example, the customs agents wear little white gloves, and use the most polite Japanese they know when dealing with the people traversing the border.
It’s extremely rare that any of my belongings are searched when entering the country, but on one occasion the customs agent girl asked if she could search my bag.
In response, I asked her if I could search her first. With genuine sincerity in her voice, she explained to me that she didn’t have a bag with her that I could search, and I felt like a bit of a jerk for asking.
I can only imagine how rude a customs agent in the USA would be if I asked them the same question.
Another example is Hong Kong. If you enter more than three times in a single year, you can apply for a frequent visitor sticker in your passport. Once you have that, you can go in and out of the country via a fully automated system without ever having to deal with another human. America may claim to be the land of the free, but in practice, that is no longer the case.
17 - Did you ever hear back from the Bernie Sanders team regarding your patriotism debate challenge?
Roger - Nope. I’m still waiting. If he was sincere about all the things he said, you would think $250,000 USD to help the charity of his choice for two hours of his time would be something he would scramble to do right away.
Perhaps he hasn’t accepted because he knows that Adam Kokesh would easily point out that government programs aren’t compassion, they are death threats. Everything governments do is ultimately backed up at the point of a gun, and they will gladly kill you for disobeying. Anything that you personally wouldn’t be willing to kill another human being over shouldn’t be a law.
18 - What led you to the discovery of voluntaryism?
Roger - I started out believing in the religion of statism just like everyone else around me. I said the pledge of allegiance every single day in school for somewhere around a decade.
I thought Americans should only drive American cars, should only buy American made products, that the minimum wage actually helped poor people, and that government was actually a great thing for society.
Then I started to study economics. I began reading Adam Smith, Ludwig Von Mises, Milton Friedman, Henry Hazlitt, Leonard Reed, Murray Rothbard, and more. I learned how free trade, combined with comparative advantage, and the division of labor, indisputably make the world a better place. I learned that the minimum wage doesn’t guarantee that low-skilled workers will have a job, it simply guarantees that anyone with skills worth less than the minimum wage won’t have any job at all. I began to feel embarrassed for the economically ignorant policies I had been in favor of previously. The more economics I studied, the more I realized that peaceful human interaction, free of the coercion of the state, is the best way to achieve the desired economic prosperity. These utilitarian arguments are what brought me most of the way to being a voluntaryist. Around this same time I also started studying some of the philosophical ideas related to individual rights.
I was persuaded by many of the arguments put forth by John Locke explaining that each man owns his own labor, and when he mixes his labor with something in nature that was previously unowned, that product becomes his own property.
Chattel slavery is wrong because you are stealing another man’s labor. Theft of physical property is wrong because you are stealing another man’s labor. They are actually two sides of the same coin.
Much much later in my life, I came across the ideas of Michael Huemer and Larken Rose. They pointed out ever so clearly that “authority” of the political kind, does not, and can not exist. It is just imagined by the majority of society. The guns, police, buildings, and violence are all real, but the authority itself is just imagined. For example, none of us individually have the right to lock our neighbor in a cage for smoking a plant, or tell someone else who he can or can’t do business with, so how can we as individuals delegate rights that none of us have to our “representatives” in government? How could a “representative” possibly have more authority than those he “represents”? The whole thing is madness if one takes the time to think about it.
19 - Do you believe BTC will become the world’s default currency?
Roger - My thoughts went something like this:
2011: I thought there was a small chance of this, but had to try.
2012: I thought there was a better chance of this, so I had to try even harder.
2013: It’s happening! It’s time to really pick up the pace!
2014: This is amazing! The whole world is starting to notice Bitcoin!
2015: Wow! So many people are using Bitcoin that the blocks are starting to get very full! We better do what any sensible businessman would do, and what Satoshi recommended. Expand Bitcoin to continue to provide a good level of service to people who want to use it.
2016: Oh no! A bunch of people with no business sense have taken control of the current Bitcoin software implementation and are forcing every major business who would have been interested in Bitcoin to look for other solutions. Oh no! All the people who are mining Bitcoin don’t have any long-term vision for the goal of Bitcoin and aren’t doing the sensible thing at the moment. I suppose I should:
Do something to allow Bitcoin to scale to allow new users.
Mining pool to influence the debate.
Set up a competing development team and make sure they have people who understand economics and business to help guide them.
Fork Bitcoin to allow it to accept new users.
Look for a competing cryptocurrency that actually has better properties than Bitcoin to be used as money. Z.cash is one that is very high on my list of things to keep an eye on.
20 - What’s one thing very few people know about you?
Roger - I'm not sure how many people know it or not, but I have a few:
I didn’t choose the name Bitcoin Jesus for myself, other people started calling me that because of my efforts to spread the good word of Bitcoin. I’m not a fan of the name myself.
Some people on the Internet try to dismiss me as some fool who got lucky by buying bitcoin early. In reality, I was a semi-retired self-made millionaire, who had built a substantial business long before Bitcoin had ever been invented. When I became the first person in the world to start funding Bitcoin startups, almost all of that money was earned by my previous tech business, not from the price of Bitcoin increasing.
I actually don’t enjoy traveling, dealing with crowds, or public speaking. I would much rather spend time home alone with my computer or a book. Bitcoin is exciting and important enough that it motivates me to do the former.

1 - How would you describe yourself in one sentence?
Roger - I’m someone who believes that all human interactions should be on a consensual basis, or not at all.
2 - Other than digital currency, what blockchain technologies are you most excited about?
Roger - I’m also very excited about prediction markets like Bitcoinhivemind.com
3 - Do you expect Bitcoin to outperform gold, silver and the stock market in 2017?
Roger - The Bitcoin network is already at maximum capacity, so if the current team of developers don’t allow it to scale quickly enough to meet the demand, the future for Bitcoin is bleak.
I’m sure the current core developers are talented programmers, but most of them are clueless when it comes to basic economics, and providing an incentive for people to use Bitcoin.
Recently at a Silicon Valley Bitcoin meet-up I hosted, one of the current Bitcoin developers was literally telling people that they should use credit cards instead of Bitcoin.
I think that is a ridiculous thing to say, since I specifically got involved to build a currency that can rival the Dollar, the Euro, and the Yen. Telling people to use credit cards won’t accomplish that goal.
I’m currently exploring options including starting my own mining pool, hiring a competing full-time dev team, or even hard forking Bitcoin to stay in line with Satoshi’s original vision of P2P cash.
If my group of like-minded supporters do hard fork Bitcoin, we will also likely change the proof of work to something that is most suited to general purpose CPUs rather than GPUs or ASICs.
I suspect that will be a real wakeup call to the current Bitcoin miners and hardware manufacturers that the market clearly needs and wants Bitcoin to be allowed to scale.
4 - Which is your favorite Bitcoin wallet for daily transactions?
Roger - I have many different wallets. In fact, I have nearly all of the major ones installed on my systems, and keep my coins spread between many of them.
On mobile and desktop I use Blockchain.info the most.
Second place would be KryptoKit / JAXX.
5 - Do you still get harassed by hackers?
Roger - Unfortunately I’m a high profile target for hackers, so almost daily I have malicious files emailed to me, or see notifications about someone trying to reset one of my online passwords.
I think I have most everything locked down pretty tight at the moment.
A few years ago, a hacker was able to gain access to an old email address, and started gaining additional access from there.
It was a real wake-up call that I need to take security even more seriously.
I then launched a website called BitcoinBountyHunter.com to help deter would-be hackers and thieves.
6 - Do you own a major credit card?
Roger - Sure.
7 - What do you think about the 21 Inc Bitcoin computer and the 21 Inc vision of a “machine Internet” and economy?
Roger - It is only a matter of time until machine intelligence exceeds human intelligence, and around that same time machine commerce will exceed human commerce.
Bitcoin seems like the perfect basis for this coming economy.
8 - How long have you been training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu?
Roger - About eight-and-a-half years total now. I’ve been a purple belt for the last four-and-a-half years, but my training pace has slowed down as I became so busy with Bitcoin things.
I’ve been dealing with a lot of injuries over the last two years as well, but hope to stay healthy, win some big tournaments, and get my brown belt in 2017.
Most people don’t know it, but there are actually more Jiu Jitsu videos of me on Youtube than Bitcoin videos.
Aside from Bitcoin, BJJ is truly one of my passions in life.
9 - What is the biggest difference between living in Japan and America?
Roger - I think the quality of the food, the attention to detail, and the quality of customer service are all much higher in Japan than in the USA.
The weather was certainly much better in California where I grew up, though.

10 - What was the price of the first Bitcoin that you owned?
Roger - I received my first portion of a Bitcoin from Gavin Andresen’s faucet. At the time I’m sure it was well under a dollar per Bitcoin.
I would guess it was in the $0.25 to $0.50 range at that time. I bought my first Bitcoins when they were about $1 each.
Sadly, this is another example of just how little business sense the current development team have.
The vast majority of Bitcoin users previously received their first Bitcoin from a faucet. I remember receiving mine that way and feeling the excitement of the technological magic that had just happened before my eyes. Imagine how many other people could experience that joy of using Bitcoin for the first time if Bitcoin had been allowed to scale.
Today, with transaction fees consistently about $0.10 and often much more, Bitcoin faucets are no longer feasible, and the Bitcoin community is missing out on this amazing tool to recruit new Bitcoin users.
11 - Do you think censorship of minority opinions will affect Steemit.com the same way it is affecting Reddit?
Roger - I haven’t used Steemit myself yet, so I don’t know enough about how it works to have an opinion.
I do know that the disallowing of any dissenting opinions by Theymos on has turned what was previously a heated discussion online, into an entire Bitcoin ecosystem that is now filled with anger, vitriol, and personal attacks. This is a direct result of Theymos’ actions, and he should be ashamed.
All of us should be speaking out against his policy, and apply social pressure to the owners of Reddit to appoint a moderator who actually allows people to discuss Bitcoin.
Theymos can then go find a new job with the propaganda ministry of some government. He would fit right in.
12 - What do you think about Steemit’s concept?
Roger - I’ll need to read more about it since I know almost nothing.
13 - Do you believe we will solve the block size issue in 2016? What will happen if we don’t?
Roger - I’m less and less confident of this. In my entire involvement with Bitcoin, I’ve never sold a single one due to not being optimistic about the future.
After talking with many of the Bitcoin miners from China over the last few days, and hearing that they currently are not willing to do the smart thing and allow Bitcoin to scale in a timely manner, I’m on the very verge of selling some of my Bitcoins. Perhaps one day very soon I will be devoting all of my attention to a hard fork of Bitcoin that actually allows scaling in a timely manner.
The underlying economic code of Bitcoin is just as important to its success as the software code. You need both to be correct, or the whole thing is broken.
The current path that the small blockers are taking has the wrong economic code and will likely end in failure if Bitcoin isn’t allowed to scale soon.
14 - What’s your biggest Pet Peeve?
Roger - No shoes allowed inside the house!

might want to retrain HR to use same practices as car dealerships, boat dealerships, etc etc. When verifying apps for a sale they use various public and private services to verify applicants address. (And they never accept P.O. boxes as an address) If person has not lived at current address for at least such and such a time they dig even further. Some also require paystubs from previous employers along with voice confirmation. Another thing they do is verify references using the same techniques as I described above. Also consider using a skip-tracer first (they can pull credit reports,etc) before eventually bringing in a private detective. It will save you a lot of money. I know this seems extreme but probably worth it considering all the money lost to the thieves. Thanks for be so open.

Oh the irony in this statement.
@_date: 2016-04-01 11:51:38
Bitcoinland is abuzz with speculation Craig Steven Wright will out himself as Satoshi Nakamoto, the cryptocurrency’s pseudonymous creator, within the next two weeks and that he is looking for backing in his verification from some of the industry’s biggest players.
Wright, a self-declared cyber security expert who claims to hold a theology PhD, was originally identified as Satoshi in December 2015 following the publication by Wired and Gizmodo of supposedly leaked emails and documents purporting to prove Wright and a colleague, Dave Kleinman (now deceased), were the co-inventors of bitcoin. The source of the document leak was never identified.
Wright has never publicly confirmed or denied the allegations. Nor has he made any public statements or appearances since the story came out. To the contrary, most of Wright’s social media and web presence was deleted shortly after the story went public.
Adding to the intrigue, Wright’s Sydney home was raided by Australian federal police in connection to a Australian Tax Office investigation on the same day of the story’s release. It is understood, however, that Wright and his family had by then already upped and moved to London.
Now, after nearly four months of silence — and a bitcoin community mostly resigned to the notion that the story was an elaborate hoax — conditional approaches are being made to media and other institutions in connection to an upcoming “big reveal” of Wright as Satoshi Nakamoto.
The narrative being pitched is that on a pre-agreed date — ranging from April 7 to April 14 — Wright will publicly perform a cryptographic miracle which proves his identity once and for all. Those institutions being offered the inside scoop on his life story, meanwhile, are supposedly being asked by those claiming to be Wright’s legal representatives to abide by strict embargoes, timed to pre-empt the stage-managed revelations and the public press conference to follow.
The attempt at media management, however, echoes a familiar pattern.
The dossier of leaked emails used by Wired and Gizmodo as the source for their story was also heavily circulated to rival media outlets by anonymous parties weeks ahead of its ultimate publication.
Notable authority figures from the bitcoin community are alleged to have been impressed by the processes Wright is using to prove his identity and are standing ready to endorse Wright’s identity as Satoshi or are on the verge of doing so in the not to distant future.
One name referenced in that regard is Jon Matonis, a founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation. Asked for comment he told FT Alphaville: “I have been contacted by a private group and I am under a strict NDA [non-disclosure agreement] and press embargo during due diligence phase.”
With respect to the technical processes which Wright would have to perform to prove his identity, Bitcoin developer, Gavin Andresen, told FT Alphaville the following in an emailed statement over the weekend:
I’d want to see:
A message signed with the same PGP key Satoshi used back in 2010. (…but his computer could have been hacked)
A message signed with keys from early Bitcoin blocks (…but his wallet could have been stolen).
Email or private forum posts he sent to me in 2010 (… but email could have been hacked).
A conversation about technical stuff, ideally via email, so I can see if it feels like the same person I communicated with in 2010.
Irrespective of whether Wright convinces the bitcoin community he is or is not Satoshi, as long as a reasonable doubt exists in the minds of many his views could end up influencing matters in the current blocksize debate — a community schism over bitcoin’s development and scaling, a split now threatening the entire bitcoin system.
Will Craig Wright be the one to shepherd his flock to consensus and safety? Only the community can decide.
What we do know is that Wright’s self-cited credentials, as pulled from Linkedin before his profile was deleted, suggest an affinity with matters schismatic and biblical:

He hopped on the 2X train so he was willing to implement Segwit for that. He's a piece of shit who is mad because bitcoiners wouldn't allow Coinbase to exteranlise their costs on to the network.

Here's the other one

shaddup or I'll unfollow you on Twitter. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:54:29
They are high because companies like Bitpay, Coinbase Blockchain and Keepkey haven't implemented Segwit, don't batch and pay 20x more than what is needed, so others then have to outbid them to get into the block.

Can you allay our fears of mining centralization? Such as that the majority of mining farms are in China, the majority of pools are owned by Chinese, and the majority of asics are manufactured in China. Such as that majority of businesses, wallets and users want segregated witness but miners are refusing to signal for it.

@_date: 2017-02-25 21:56:53
Don't go all conspirtard on me. I asked the other subreddit to name a single Bitcoin expert who supported Bitcoin Unlimited while at the same time stating that I could list probably 50 who support Core's roadmap and or segregated Witness. After two or three days they could name only one. Gavin, which is true but he also supports segregated Witness, and they challenged me to list the 50 Bitcoin experts.
 I tried to discuss how we should agree on what constitutes a Bitcoin expert, with me suggesting someone who has worked with the Bitcoin code or who has previously worked on the Bitcoin code for at least 2 years. They declined so I'm not going to bother.
@_date: 2017-02-17 21:44:27
Well two can play at that game because Roger and his cabal just got back from China on a whirlwind trip convincing minors to adopt Bitcoin unlimited by admittedly bribing them, but he won't call it a bribe.

Bitcoin unlimited wants to change that delicate balance. They want to give more power to the miners. That's a problem.
@_date: 2017-02-15 23:20:59
Probably 95% of the technical community thinks that Bitcoin Unlimited is a danger to the Bitcoin Network so how do you explain the behavior of the mostly Chinese miners?

The only thing I had done was compliment flibbr on a few calls and threw him some changtip bits for those calls. Maybe I accidentally got caught up in his 'block on twitter' net.

Some of us believe Jihan is behind all these new mining pools where he's trying to hide the fact that all of the hash comes from him. Chinese miners want to be able to censor transactions they do not want fungibility or privacy at the protocol level and quite frankly won't allow it.

@_date: 2016-01-31 00:46:05


I notice you added that sentence w/o disclosing the edit.
I trust core devs with their experience, knowledge and commitment. Classic sprang up out of thin air. They act like amateurs. Companies were backing them publicly with very little knowledge of what they were getting. It was embarrassing and enlightening at the same time. I am not against a 1 mb bump if it is safe and non-contentious. But here's the thing, my opinion doesn't really count, yours does, and pretending to have no bias while obviously having one is dishonest. So thanks for finally clarifying.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:53:59

@_date: 2017-03-25 17:27:46
It was *never* meant to be a *vote* it is meant to be a *signal*. You know, to signal readiness for new features. Once you understand Bitcoin come back and we'll talk, mmkay?

It was Gavin's idea and he pushed hard for it and won. Other devs didn't really like it or didn't care.

You guys remind me of unions in the USA. I used to back the unions. Who wouldn't support good pay and safe working conditions for the workers? Then the Union's overplayed their hands bigly and demanded more and more and more  until they had to be busted up. Now the miners have to be busted because they overplayed their hand. Deal with it.

I'm on mobile so I can't help you with links, but check Alex's tweets from the last day or two. He showed the month of February stats and I believe a couple hundred thousand transactions that could have been mined were not mined because of Antpools partial and empty blocks.

You may be mistaken as Jihan is a major investor in RSK and Chain Labs 'wings' which while they work w/o segwit, they work much, much better with segwit. Something is not adding up. Unless they think BU can implement segwit? dunno.

Alex of bitFury had the data for the month of February on Twitter. The empty and partial blocks from Antpool alone was worth I think a couple hundred thousand transactions that could have been mined but weren't. I'll go look for the info so check back in a bit and I'll edit my comment.

Then you have this comment from Jihan after the exchanges made their announcement: 
"All the exchanges who signed are not world class level. They think they're clever, but didn't figure out the most basic logic. The situation is more complex but the result is clear. The big pools will win and the rest can't survive".
"These stupid cunts are going to be caught unprepared for the complex circumstances in which the fork is going to occur."

First of all he's not a Bitcoin developer. Secondly, do you even bother to read read all the responses to his original post? They clearly explained why you can't just say things like "man this is crazy" or "I don't think you know how this works". The mailing list isn't Reddit!

Perhaps the problem is Jihad Wu has been holding SegWit hostage but will eventually need a soft fork of Bitcoin for Rootstock and actually expects to get it. LMFAO!
@_date: 2017-02-15 22:39:29
Mining is not highly decentralized when probably over 75% of the hash rate belong to Chinese miners living under communist rule, not to mention probably over 75% of the pools are Chinese owned and probably 80% of Asic manufacturers are Chinese owned.

There are many in the other subreddit that also support segregated Witness. Please get a clue and pay attention.
Jihan broke the rules by splitting up his hash rate between several different mining pools and trying to hide it. Miners do not own the Bitcoin project. You really need to understand that.

The problem with that is Antpool's Jihan probably owns Viabtc. Antpool is mining many empty blocks and many blocks with few trxs so the accelerator is not having any effect. They pretend to be altruistic when in reality they are not. Just my opinion.

You should know that Roger Ver and rbtc *do* censor. Me and many, many, many people are forced to wait 10 minutes in between comments there. This has been brought up to Roger on numerous occasions by numerous people and he *does nothing*. I suggest you speak with him about this, and don't let him tell you he has no control and that it is a Reddit-wide policy. He can over-ride this policy if he really cares about censorship.

Segwit has a number of non-ideal warts at the consensus protocol level, mostly stuff another few months of development time and review could have ironed out (or resulted in a lot of arguments about bikesheds).
There’s a few “close calls” in the consensus-critical implementation that could lead to bugs later, but don’t appear to be actual issues right now.
Having said that, there doesn’t seem to be anything seriously wrong with the current consensus implementation or protocol design; at worst we’ve added a bit of technical debt, in exchange for getting critically needed functionality out the door.
There does appear to be a nuisance problem with the non-consensus transaction propagation part of the P2P protocol, though fixing it may require a rethink of how transaction invs work.
We haven’t actually fixed the O(n²) signature hashing problem yet, although we’re fairly confident that we can, and there’s a open pull-req implementing the cache that we need.

The problem with this is Rodger does not have the qualifications to pick a Bitcoin development team.

You've been bamboozled. Once you kill Bitcoin Core with those miners help they will abandon 2x and mine 100% bcash. That will kill CorpCoin. At this point it should be a competition between Core and Cash. Mark my words...

"scaling side is pro segwit" 
and 
" SegWit will never ever be activated. It’s not about the 95% threshold. Even in 75% or 51% scenarios it will not be alive. Why? I am a miner, a member of the mining pools. I invested millions of real wealth into the mining business. Got an issue? Show me your money."
**EVER HEARD THE SAYING 'TALKING OUT OF BOTH SIDES OF YOUR MOUTH?'**
"will be dominated by big players"   Will be domintated by big miners.
"They wanted to brag about the workload" A megalomaniac and a dick too!
"What if he’s wrong?" What if you're wrong and BU and you miners break the network? What makes you think millions of us want BU devs in charge of and responsible for the Bitcoin code? What makes you more important than us?
"Core’s daddy BS is the standard maker of LN?" Blockstream will not profit from LN. Didn't know that, did ya? 
"“who’s-your-daddy” Core" You are a total asshole.
" What is the consequence of Core breaking Bitcoin the big toy? Leave." I'd bet most Core devs have been around longer than you.

speaking of Charlie Lee, he seems to be muddying up the waters over at other sub. 
"First of all, let me clarify. I'm Director of Engineering at Coinbase. My views about how best for Bitcoin to scale differs from Brian. And that's ok and encouraged because scaling Bitcoin, though very important, is tangential to Coinbase's mission, which is to make Bitcoin easy to use.
My view is that I agree with Core that we need to be more conservative with the block size increase. But I don't agree that SegWit should come before a hardfork. I think we should do a 2mb hard fork ASAP and add SegWit, IBLT, and other improvements afterwards. Yet, I think having everyone switching over to Classic today is not a good solution either. I respect Gavin and Garzik a lot, but we shouldn't alienate the Core devs. So I'm hoping the threat of Classic and this letter will convince the Core devs to compromise and work together to come up with a scaling plan that most people will be on board with. If this last ditch attempt doesn't work, then our only option is the nuclear option of overthrowing Core with Classic."

@_date: 2017-04-28 20:31:26
Roger is on a smear campaign. Just yesterday he made a post on his subreddit that accused Blockstream of keeping most of their money in fiat instead of bitcoin because they don't believe in Bitcoin. I've seen Adam explain the reason they have to do that has to do with legalities. He also constantly says Blockstream and Core devs are purposely trying to destroy Bitcoin. Where are you when Roger does these things?

" I think the UASF proposal is kind of foolish for requiring the bit be set in all blocks to trigger non-UASF proposals, and I also think it is overly hasty though I understand the motives. I hope this proposal will moot the need for the shalinfry proposal."

Spoke too soon: The consequences of using scrypt mean that there has not been as much of an 'arms race' in litecoin (and other scrypt currencies), because there is (so far) no ASIC technology available for this algorithm. However, this is soon to change, thanks to companies like Alpha Technologies, which is now taking preorders.

@_date: 2017-04-06 01:52:11
Which begs the question of why Poon et al intentionally broke SegWit on the main chain if it's trivial to keep it there. the plot thickens. If you weren't in on it, did Jihan tell you he refuses code from Core and wants then fired, and since you want Lighting so badly you agreed to work around Core? I'd prefer you were bamboozled than evil. Come clean and tell us the real reason you were willing to throw away a years worth of work Core devs put into SegWit. This whole ordeal doesn't pass the sniff test.

I had a revelation about 40 minutes ago. I'm posting my response to Gavin's tweet and I suggest you unblock me just long enough to read it or use incognito.
The fact is you CEO's have gone about this all wrong. The mailing list which Jeff claims is open is actually not. I've asked him at least 2 or 3 times to add me to the list and he either refuses or has me muted. 
Your btc1 slack was originally private. It's now open but there are rumors you guys simply opened another private slack to replace it. Correct me if the rumors are wrong. Did you delete any conversations in the slack before you opened it up to the public?
You CEO's are discussing the project via private emails instead of public IRC logs. Are they being archived?
Bitcoin is supposed to be open source but by all accounts btc1 is not. You are communicating and making decisions in private, not to mention you all have insider knowledge.
I envision some lawsuits against you all personally and also your companies. There was a right way to do this and a wrong way and you CEO's and your companies chose the wrong way.
Edit to add "instead of public IRC logs."
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:00:42

I never said CSW wants to patent bcash. I said he wants to insert patented code into bcash and then charge others to use that patented code. Someone posted his tweet in this thread where he says exactly that. And from what I've read if you're using the MIT license like bcash is, they cannot charge anyone to use their code. IANAL but here's the MIT terms.  and here's FOSS definiton

Hi theymos....Not sure if you read nchain's latest blog post on the supposed legal pitfalls of SegWit but was having a convo with one of CSW's lapdogs, JVP, and he said this: "SegWit, ,by economically encouraging pruning, and by sending even more data than simple block size scaling, is a move toward centralization." And this "Legal costs if any at all from SegWit pruning, are a centralizing factor.
Smaller players can't afford to play the legal game." What are your thoughts on his statement? Thanks in advance.

I agree. I called out Cobra a week ago on Twitter for saying the Bitcoin white paper needs to be changed.

If bcash inserts code from one of nChain's patents can you still use that code freely like in Bitcoin? I would imagine if nChain doesn't want anyone using the patent they will insist bcash become closed source. CSW keeps saying he's going to let bcash use his patents and not allow others or maybe charge others. It will be interesting to see what happens.

Matt is one of the top Core devs and Belshe is co-founder of Bitgo. You don't realize how many miners and businesses are freaking terrified of the btc1 code. This HF nonsense was just a game of chicken with the Core devs and the devs didn't flinch but some NYA signatories are.

Some people work on it full-time, some part-time. Many cogs in the wheel. Computer scientists, cryptographers, engineers, etc. Hundreds of people around the world work on it since it's open source software. There are the main contributors known as Core devs that do most of the work. Some of their work is sponsored by MIT, some devs work for companies that sponsor their work, but most are volunteers. You can start here for some info: 
@_date: 2016-05-21 22:52:22
There is another post about this and also check out Coinbase Community where I just found this: "Admittedly I am new to bitcoin but apparently someone hacked into my computer yesterday (?!?!?!!!) and made 3 withdrawls/transactions that I did NOT authorize. can anything be done about this or am I just screwed?

"Let's be honest, by July 2018 bitcoin's network effects and confidence will be lost"
I'm not fully on board with BIP148 but it's getting really bad out there with high fees and confirmation times.
I told you before you should get on Twitter. You can follow some Bitcoiners and get a feel for what's going on outside of Reddit. Just make up a fake handle. You don't even have to tell anyone, do it anon.

I think you're being unrealistic if you think everyone will wait 4 years for a HF. It' just not based in reality. Core being right doesn't mean they win the argument.

AFAIK no Core devs were part of this agreement.

Don't pools have a say? Also, I've heard miners don't care about SegWit or BU, they just want to make money and most don't pay attention to this battle.

Please read the whole article. A lot of insight in to the Chinese mining community.

I've never seen Brian act humble. As a matter of fact quite the opposite. Can you post links of some examples?
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:01:23
How do you reconcile? 
@_date: 2016-07-19 16:00:41
Doesn't really matter...

Once segwit activates various data from that needs to be studied to decide a hard Fork plan.

I didn't say p2xtpool invented it, but they are a p2pool.

He didn't *realize* it, it was pointed out to him.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:02:30
I read a tweet about them switching to ckpool and how ckpool has segwit as a default and GBminers may just not have switched it yet. Something to that fact. That was someone's guess.

Also bigger and bigger blocks which will push out smaller miners making mining even more centralized.
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:22:42
Because they don't want Core to be the reference client any longer.

Someone suggested Deadalinix wrote the blog post.

Dude, you've gone full retard and done a complete 180 from 6 months ago. I see the crap you spew on the other sub. Get lost.

I've been over there quite a bit today and haven't seen a single lawyer comment. I've seen a few crypto/bitcoin lawyers on Twitter who seem very supportive of this action by Blockstream. I can give you links if you like.

I count 100. Is that average?

But they're being replay attacked. It's all over Twitter. Presumably that's why they halted trading and withdraws of ETH at least on GDAX.

Many agree with BIP 148 but some do not.

p2xtpool is a p2pool for mining XT and Classic according to their Twitter.

I post this  in a thread he started about his 'Blockade' article. Shocking thing is, it not only didn't get deleted, it got upvoted. One of my very few upvoted comments over there. :P

I think Bitmain's blog post yesterday made the other miners see the light.

No on picked them, it's a meritocracy and they are volunteers with a few who are sponsored by Bitcoin companies. You vote by buying or selling bitcoin or vote by which software you run.

Would have loved to see the look on their faces if you showed up to that conference. Priceless.

Hi BashCo, There's some confusion on Twitter about segwit2x. Will the segwit part be soft forked in or hard forked? Thanks in advance.

Control over direction of Bitcoin. No fungibility or privacy upgrades for one thing, probably.

The miners released a letter saying they will signal NYA in the coinbase starting Monday. That's a start. They don't want a split so I think they'll deploy on time.

My personal opinion is people are most upset about them going above and beyond the requirements for KYC/AML. I'm guessing the second factor has to do with his constantly pushing for a contentious HF. Thirdly, he acts like a pompous dick.

Oh yeah. The 4 or so logs he posted show your comments are auto-deleted because of your negative karma. I probably have about 500 negative karma so curious how many of my comments get deleted.
