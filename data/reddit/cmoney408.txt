i hate all these answers where people just say "use circle, buy it, duh"....
its actually very convoluted for someone who has NEVER done it before.
i signed up for circle. entered my debit card info. and added the max of $300 dollars to the account. (very easy to increase limits, click your name, then settings then limits).
i then clicked on my name in the top right corner. clicked currency and converted from US dollar to bitcoin.
to note, converting does NOT count towards any transfer limits. 
the part the confuses me is what is the best way to "cash out"
for instance i now have a whole whopping 1 bitcoin in my account balance. whats the best way to cash out?
do you sell it, or just convert to cash?
for instance if i wanted to take out any "interest" over where i started at. lets say yesterday i bought a single BTC for $700. but today its worth $705.
it seems like the best way is to convert back to cash. take out the $5 bucks, then convert back to BTC. so i would still have my single BTC.
but i am not sure what the limitations are on this method. are their fees or transfer limits if i did this?
what are the pros/cons of this vs:
having 1 BTC valued at $705 (but yesterday it was at $700) so i sell off a potion of the btc so that now i am back to 700 in my account ($5 dollars that i sold off is now in my bank account). but now i only have .995 BTC (or something near that).
the 2nd method seems like i would then have to pay fees and it would take time?
