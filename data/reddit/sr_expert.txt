I read the complaint a few times, especially the part where they first caught Sadler's packages. Apparently he was mailing packages every day and going around to different post offices with his girlfriend. On one particular day, according to the complaint, a dog was alerted to heroin on two different packages which were hand-addressed. When the inspectors realized they were in a similar handwriting and both packages alerted for traces of heroin, they obtained warrants and opened them. one of the packages contained no heroin but $3500 cash (probably to exchange for bitcoins or launder or something, since the person the cash was mailed to was living in Beverly Hills).
It looks like parallel construction. I would have to say it's more likely that there was some tip off before they caught the packages in the complaint. Two possibilities I thought of would be 1) The person receiving the $3500 cash in the mail (where he used his real return address) was a government informant or a g-man or 2) customs in another country tipped off the NSA/FBI/DEA to this guy since he was ordering drugs from Pakistan (they probably open every package over there). Once they had the info from the NSA/wherever, they then tailed him without a warrant, since he used a return address on the cash which tied him back to the UPS store. Also it's very suspicious at this time that he didn't pick up his last package from Pakistan named in the complaint. So he must have had something seized by the government and realized it wasn't safe. That package seized before was what led the government to tail him. 
During the time they found him through the UPS store packages (before the time in the complaint), they didn't have probably cause at this point. They knew who it was by tailing him  and when they saw him make a mailing later on on the date in the complaint, they brought dogs into the USPS mail center for "probable cause".
