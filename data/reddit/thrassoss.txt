I am an outsider in this.  I like Bitcoin and I vaguely follow news about it.  I don't give a shit if block size is increased or not. Fuck it, shrink block sizes for all I know about the subject.  I don't have a technical understanding of it.  But the faction who seems to delete posts and insinuates anyone who wants to increase block size are deranged fanatics seems like douchebags.  
I get that maybe being knowledgeable about cryptocurrency (and thus being a good candidate for being a mod here) might not have a strong correlation with political acumen but if you want feedback that is it. You vaguely seem like douchebags.

The part I really take issue with is the battle against him in public opinion.  He was a murder on trail for running a drug ring according to most press I see on the matter.

You know I actually hadn't seen a defense of it.  I'll honestly consider what you you said.

The fact that sophisticated investors are saying that the best return on their investment is cash isn't troubling to you?

Wow that's something alright.  So self-regulating banking in the UK lasted through 2 world wars but some scandal in 1984-85 caused a demand for action?  I'm vaguely curious about what scandal that was.

1st Amendment.  Information transmittal is speech.  Just because someone wishes to purchase my speech for for US Dollars and other parties set set up markets to make buying and sell speech easy does not mean it suddenly becomes 'not speech'.
IIRC Limiting speech requires [Strict Scrutiny]( on the part of the government.  This is a pretty high hurdle.

I suspect there is something somewhere in the code base that is a thing other than a security flaw.  Thusly your statement is false.
There is some utility for both consumer and enterprise, as you can google "where to spend bitcoins" and get actionable results.  Thusly your statement is false.
I really don't feel like googling for a link but there are major businesses eying the profit of a 'cashless society'.  So it might not be a post-apocalypse that see's a huge reduction in the use of physical currency.

If 3.9 Trillion gets added to the money supply and inflation is virtually 4%, yes that is problematic.

More than 2 committed crimes.  Read a bit more about the likelihood of how the State figured out who he was.  Sorry but computer crime is computer crime.

If the court thinks he attempted to have someone murdered why don't they try him for murder?

I didn't realize the hard work and dedication of the Federal Reserve was the reason the American economy is strong.  See I thought it might be primarily from people exchanging goods and services for money.  You know, not the people who run the presses that print the money.

From the [San Fransico Federal Reserve Board]( website:


It doesn't appear counterfeit money protection has much value over fiat.

An economy has existed longer than humans.  Trade almost certainly existed in various proto-human tribes.  It has been observed in rats under laboratory conditions.
The only condition under which trade can vanish is one where there is no want.  At all.  Anywhere.
@_date: 2019-03-17 20:52:16


Again trade has existed longer than humans. So long as 'want' exists then so will trade.
If every desire that the human mind can conjure is fulfilled I don't think joblessness will seem quite as bad.

I'm pretty sure in most jurisdictions an arrest warrant and a search warrant are 2 different things.

It's hard to point to a causal relationship but I tend notice a lot of stuff from the default subs in mainstream media shortly afterwards.  Yes other social mediums do effect this but it really seems like Reddit is a big hunk of this feedback loop.
  Just to give something more concrete, iirc for Obama's AMA it was mentioned some of his staff are redditors and pitched the idea.  Which implies the people who get the presidents coffee also saw that cute cat picture on the front page.  They also probably saw an interesting avenue of attack on his political opponents on r/politics. 
Directly though I don't think much negative will happen.  Wild guess 2 days of revenue to reddit.  The longer term might be more traffic to competitors but maybe not.  I'd be interested to see a graph in a few months showing traffic to Reddit and various clones over this time period.
@_date: 2015-07-05 04:50:32
While I vaguely share your sentiment, Reddit is a fairly substantial epicenter of numerous subcultures.  While the vast majority of these are trivial at most some stuff is very substantial.

Incorrect. 
What it is is a large business can bully small business in any way they like.  Then you can add on post-facto legitimacy to make it seem like the small business is immoral.
If your correct google doesn't index any criticisms of google.  Ford doesn't want to sell my business a car if I show up on the lot with one of those 'calvin peeing on a car logo' stickers.  
Literally the only businesses that behave this way are ones in monopolistic environments.
They are the same companies that shit on costumers and get caught laughing about it.  Paypal, Comcast, EA.

Just curious, is this witnessed during all cycles of Bitcoins value or just when it's flat or increasing value?

The kind of people that would argue that if the USSR had just spent more while meddling in the economy it would have produced a Utopia.
They believe there is no problem too small to fix with vast bureaucracies and government spending.  These are people that think the US dollar being the worlds reserve currency is as immutable as the law of gravity.  
Never mind improving Sino-Russian relations.  Never mind factors that will lead to balkanization of our biggest trade partners. Geopolitics be damned with them debt=good.

I get that if you only focus on the second part of the transaction, your sale of the phone, the yes that part would be free less the normal issues of government in the marketplace.
But I hesitate to strip these into 2 wholly separate transactions for the purpose of thinking of it to discern morality.  I understand if your modeling this in a trustless cryptographically secure environment that it might be necessary to organize it that way.
@_date: 2015-02-18 22:58:02
By this same definition it would seem all markets are inherently free.  If you label any method of negotiation as an abstraction to the process of exchange of goods or services then beating someone with a rake and stealing their wallet is almost no different than mowing their yard for $5.

It sounds more like she told him multiple times that the children she teaches should adhere to 1950's sensibility.  
That the children need to seem normal to fit into the kind of culture that gets good manufacturing jobs down at the plant where every other respectable person works.
Not like anyone could earn a living on those fancy computer do-dads.  They are just for video games.
