Good point but not 100% true.  Big banks like costly regulations because it means people like me and you could never start a bank up as we are incapable of complying with those regulations.  The regulations are a barrier to entry.  A protectionist system for banks.

something VERY complicated can go "mainstream" overnight if the financial benefit is there.  
for example, say something posted a private key housing 100 btc.  now, most people have no idea how to take that 100 btc but given the incentive we KNOW it will be gone by tomorrow.

LOL.  We have to be more like India and China? 
BTW, we didn't have KYC regulations for the vast majority of American legal history.  Thanks though statist.

i think andreas messed up by RUSHING to transfer his coins somewhere.  he could have messed something up in the rush.  that was probably a bigger risk than hacking.  maybe andreas can get by doing that because he is an expert but for n00bs out there, you would strongly be advised to TAKE YOUR TIME when moving big amounts around

Please consider donating to the EMP task force.  We WILL be hit by an EMP at some point.  Either by a malicious actor, such as North Korea (who already has the ability to do it), Iran, or someone else.  Or, we will get hit by a solar storm, which happen regularly every few decades.
When we get hit with an EMP, our electrical grid will be destroyed.  This infrastructure, such as hundred ton transformers which America doesn't even build anymore, is very tough to rebuild.  Without electricity, fridges will stop working, gas stations won't pump gas, farming will break down.  In short, our civilization could end.
The American military, and a Congressional EMP task force has investigated this, and admits the risks are real.  Help harden our electric grid.  When an EMP happens, god forbid, you could be responsible for saving millions of American lives.  Please feel free to ask me for further resources, ask any questions, or I can even put you in touch with patriotic and highly qualified Americans who have dedicated their life to this issue.  
PS.  no electricity, no bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-26 22:57:03
how on earth would it be sarcastic? and why do you think men are committing suicide so much? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:04:26
woops i couldnt understand your post because of how insane it must be for a man to work on male suicide and then express shock at mens rights.  i would rather light my money on fire than give it to you.  i did however donate some more to A Voice for Men.  cheers mate.

the idea that humanity will die in a nuclear apocalypse is a myth that soviets propagated to scare americans.
in a nuclear war, massive numbers of people will die, but civilization will continue, even if quite damaged.

divorce court destroys men.  do not subject your assets to divorce court.  plus, 99% of people have absolutely no ability to handle money nor sanely handle bitcoin.  all of my friends, smart people, are going totally degen on crypto currencies now.
if you have to ask, do NOT tell her about the money.  or, as someone suggested, let her know about 15 btc and see how that goes.

So after the court proceedings, Karpeles is gonna get like 150k bitcoins right? He seems to be saying that with taxes and debts he's going to lose some of that.  Okay fine, so he has 100,000 bitcoins coming his way soon.  Could someone please parse through this bullshit and tell me what he is gonna do with that now?

Indians have a real use case for bitcoin.  Their govt/society is insane.  Expect Indian usage to continuously grow.
