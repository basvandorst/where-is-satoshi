Bitstamp works quickly and effectively in my experience.

Thanks for the responses generally I am going to seriously look into it. 
Firstly I do sell completely internationally - I ship to anywhere in the world which is why BTC is of significant interest to me. 
I agree that the main issue would be the risk of losing my account - not worth it at all however I will endeavour to brave the ebay support channels to find someone with the authority and knowledge to OK it or at least to confirm there might be a risk to my account. There are certainly multiple aspects that would need further thought but I would love to be part of the process of getting BTC to a wider audience and even encourage sellers larger than me to do something similar.

Also what sort of groups on the web are the best to alert if I did start accepting BTC as a method of payment on a webstore. With currently 300,000 books available and aiming for near 5 million by the end of the year and in turn hopefully an efficient method for retailing ebooks it could be quite a good starting point for this aspect of BTC market but I have no idea of the customer base and where a large proportion of the community could be made aware of it.

I do run my own webstore separately however due to the quite competitive nature of physical media most of my sales are generated on marketplace venues.
Could certainly be a good way to get sales on my website and avoid the damn 10% commission.
