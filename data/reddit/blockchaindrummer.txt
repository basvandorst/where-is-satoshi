Why on earth would you need to move it again once it’s already on a hardware wallet. By the time I need to in 2019, the fees issues would be fixed.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:17:17
With network consensus, yes. It’s just decimal point

What are these high fees you all talk about. I just moved 0.1 BTC from gdax to my wallet for zero fees. Gdax paid it and in 10 min have 1 confirmation already.

It’s just a couple of dozen words. Surely you are smart enough to see why bitcoin is he future 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:37:19
We are waiting for you to sell so bitcoin can bottom 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:26:03
And if you think fees are high now, you will have a heart attack when bitcoin is at 100K and fees are like 300 bucks 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:15:10
A lot of us already cashed out “x”% of our fiat based savings (savings account, cds, equities, bonds) TO bitcoins, where x is a function of your own comfort level. For me that’s about 10-15% today and growing 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:11:29
One never really owns bitcoins. One simply may have the private key that signs a particular transaction which is then confirmed by the network
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:24:49
The fees are high because a LOT of people are using it despite the high fees

Well written. Absolutely agree

You mean where the central bank consciously devalues it by 2-3% at minimum every year, the so called inflation target, so they can steal about a third or more of your dollar savings every 10 years and give it to the banks and other debtors. Funny how compounding works for stealing too.
Pretty good ponzi scheme the Federal Reserves been at the last 50 years or so

What crash? It was a barely a dip
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:50:50
It’s a scam. You are better off buying the same in actual coins directly. If you mine yourself you may have a shot based on your costs 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:10:17
Can’t believe you are falling for this fud. Doesn’t deserve any response or attention. It’s just fud

Peter Schiff being Peter Schiff. He’s not wrong on the dollar, just mentally unhinged and closed to anything other than a block of gold as a true hedge to the dollar.
Move over grandpa. We don’t care

What I worry more now is: what’s the value of my dollar assets in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:15:42
For now sure
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:34:44
Are you really this naive? They use inflation so the debtors can reissue their debt and pay back the savers in inflated dollars all the while high fiving while savers won’t even know they are getting fucked 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:50:41
Hehe yep

The only people who are rich today are ones who put every single penny into bitcoins before this run up. Rest are just sour grapes

He’s probably going to get a divorce or something  when wife finds out in the monthly credit card statement 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:10:51
Yep that’s just at least they have stolen that much. In reality probably many times over with all the banking sector bailouts. Stick the bill to our kids and grand kids

50 bucks every month since 2013. Today over 100K... invested so I can quit my day job some day soon. Mt Gox blowing up
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:36:11
Buy slowly and consistently, like x amount per week, where x could be whatever you are comfortable with, e.g. 50-100 bucks. It all adds up
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:05:59
What a time to be alive!

Seems like sour grapes
