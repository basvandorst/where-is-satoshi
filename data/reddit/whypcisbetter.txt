So wouldn't they profit from bitcoin users, even if they were just "in it for the money", nonetheless?

A lot of verification needed there, I think, or am I wrong?
@_date: 2014-04-05 01:56:59
Does this only work if I am in the US? I actually live in Europe. Do you know any similar methods that I can use here?
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:45:23
I mean like China, stopping Bitcoin to spread out. This kind of thing can kill Bitcoin if other countries follow suit.

It would probably not be worthless then, just not as useful as it could be.

What are the implications of this for the future of Bitcoin? I also always thought about this imbalance  and what it might lead to. I think this is the biggest problem for Bitcoin right now by far, uneven spread.

So is this not true?
@_date: 2014-04-05 01:32:57
Anything for Europe?
@_date: 2014-04-06 21:59:36
How so?
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:44:12
What do you mean? China is doing it.

wow, amazing answer! I would very much like to see something like a worldwide cryptocurrency that also wouldn't be subject to inflation or any governmental control besides establishing it as a 1:1 transport from other currencies and never touching it again. Unfortunately, I can't see this happening so soon either.

Sorry, see my edit above
@_date: 2014-04-06 21:50:29
They could sell it immediately

lol, that's what I thought, thanks for saving my dumb ass. How do you guys get your hands on bitcoins? I pretty much live in the middle of nowhere and she was the only one who showed up on localbitcoins in my area, turns out she's not even there anymore. I hoped to meet her and buy some bitcoins for cash, but it seems I'm not going to find anyone. What's the safest way to buy bitcoins that's left for me?
@_date: 2014-04-05 01:10:52
What program or website can do this kind of thing?
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:21:45
I don't believe it either, I'm just asking if it's possible and what would the government stand to gain from it?
@_date: 2014-04-07 15:22:04
The problem is also that it isn't obvious how we could make a new cryptocurrency without this problem. All of the coins suffer from this same imbalance.  
Maybe today's money will eventually become digital and more like Bitcoin without losing it's value. That's what I hope for at least. I also haven't bought any Bitcoins yet, although it's really tempting. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 21:50:39
Thanks for the reply. Isn't SEPA highly traceable though? 
@_date: 2014-04-07 15:29:10
Could today's money become more and more digital and eventually end up where Bitcoin is today without losing it's value? Could the dollar merge with euro and yen etc and become a universal world cryptocurrency, circumventing the banks?
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:52:08
I'm talking about banning the spread, like completely regulating it into the underground, which would make it pretty much worthless, or only used for criminal activity.
