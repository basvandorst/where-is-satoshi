I would really like if you can take a look at educatelanka.org
It's a non-profit organization registered in the US which helps underprivileged kids in Sri Lanka with financial difficulties for education.
I am currently supporting 3 kids but it would be really awesome if you can donate even a small amount to the foundation.

Can someone please explain how the plausible deniability work along with the passphrase? Thanks!
I couldn't quite understand the article. Thanks!

Thanks for the explanation. How does the passphrase come in to play in this scenario ? I see that I can create a temporary passphrase or attach it to a PIN. What does that do?

Go buy from Gemini if they are supported. I used coinbase earlier as well but the fees are just crazy! Gemini is only 0.25%.

While you are at it, you might want to check out Dexie.js as well :) It's a IndexedDB wrapper and I think it'll make your life easier

You didn't know that picture sizes were measured by milligrams? It's roughly 100x100 pixels per gram

IndexedDB would be your ideal choice :)

Don't be disheartened if this takes time. My colleagues have been waiting for about 2 weeks for verification. When one of them opened a support request, he was told that there's a huge backlog of verifications
