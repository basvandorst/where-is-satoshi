Pokerstars, Full Tilt Poker, and Party Poker were all located, operated, and licensed in countries that were not the United States, and they were all forced out of US operations regardless with each of their executives and principals being targeted by the DOJ all the same. 
It's just not as simple as that, unfortunately.

How many people are going to sell a bike, a car, a computer, a service for BTC when they can't exchange it into USD? BTC is a huge magnitude of mainstream popularity away from being usable for more than purchases from fringe e-retailers right now. 
If you couldn't exchange BTC into fiat you probably couldn't even buy guns and drugs with it, let alone anything else. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:17:36
What they did with poker was just target the payment processors and specifically the actual humans who were officers in the payment processors. 
Pretty much everyone (payment processors, e-wallets, and poker sites) except for Full Tilt got the fuck out of the US online poker market within a month because their executives feared having a warrant for their personal arrest being issued, which is significant since many of them, whether international companies or not, were US residents. And then there's all the countries with extradition treaties. You run out of good places to run.
Fortunately with BTC this kind of event is still relevantly far away (3+ months at least) and may not even happen.
What's best about it is as soon as they start making moves like this, the first few attempts are always quashed by public resistance or resistance within the House/Senate and the corresponding effect of trying to do so will be that BTC quickly gains attention and publicity. 
It's several months after the first one or two failures that you really are in danger of them actually getting such a bill through.

It's really not that easy to "declare bitcoin illegal". It's even harder to declare it illegal because in order to garner public support for doing so, the MSM will have to bring huge, huge attention to BTC while attacking it. 
As they attack it, people will do analysis as they question: "Is BTC legit? What's the real story?" What they'll find is that it's a currency and a currency is not a problem in and of itself, saving for that it may threaten the bottom line of certain ruling interests who spend several MM/year lobbying Senators/Reps. 
In turn, those people who investigate will write, as counter point, in defense of the BTC system. As they do, a ton of people all over the world will take real note of BTC and begin accepting in it as currency or speculating in the currency. 
Thusly, if they do seek to eliminate BTC what they'll do is much dirtier and more effective than challenge BTC in the public and serving as free advertising for an uncontrolled currency.

Yeah but you're talking 10+ weeks just on Avalon producing and shipping the chips. Afterwards, they have to be distributed. Then the manufacturers have to assemble a working product. 
If it turns out there's a problem in the design or that in practice it comes out too slow/too hot/too much power/not reliable etc (there's almost 0% chance there will be no problems on an open source board design that's never been tested in practice), you're looking at even more time. 
If your board breaks/lemons/isn't done right you're relying on the warranty of your assembler to fix it for you, and you'll never get the opportunity cost back as difficulty increases while your board is out for repair for 2-6 weeks. 
It's just not so simple unfortunately.

Because there's only 4 places you're getting an ASIC probably before 2014. 
1. Avalon (May as well be vapourware like BFL. Preorders forever and have barely shipped any units);
2. BFL (lol scammed);
3. Asic Miner blade/USB (expensive, but literally the only way to get an ASIC today);
4. Group buy Avalon chips into group buy Klondike assembly (10+ weeks from group buy order to receiving chips minimum. More weeks for assembly and shipping. Have to not get ripped off by both the group buy organizer and the assemblers). 
None of those options short of winning the lottery of being one of the 10-20 preorders Avalon decides to actually give a product to every month count as "just around the corner". 
@_date: 2013-05-06 06:21:31
It went down to 79 amidst a huge market sell order, so you wouldn't have been able to catch it unless you had anticipated it anyway. It sprung from 86 after the big dip back into the high 90s in less than an hour.

People would not have built this amount of computing power for an endeavor besides Bitcoin, so the argument is moot imo. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:51:37
Those people who have put hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, either as individuals, or cumulatively, into ASICS, and before that, GPU farms, certainly wouldn't have been spending that money on computing hardware for a "greater" purpose. 
It would be locked away in an investment, or converted to real estate, or blown on cars and parties. People got into it because they believed in the Bitcoin system/idea and saw that they could make money in the process of establishing the network. 
I fail to see the problem. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 21:02:46
I agree that FPGAs are a really, really bad investment right now. It's about as bad of an investment as building GPU rigs to mine anything but LTC. 
My point was mostly that Avalon chip orders being usable ASICs for anyone who isn't Asic Miner or who didn't win the Avalon batch 1/2 lottery is probably a realistic minimum 4 months out. 
That being said, they're the only half decent ASIC investment that exists right now.
@_date: 2013-05-23 17:19:32
People with a hardon for Asic Miner shares should take note of this. 
Asic Miner is a mining company located in China. It was even mentioned during the CCP Propaganda Ministry's hype of Bitcoin in the last few weeks. Realize clearly that this means they have the favour of Party bosses at this time. 
However, should they lose that favour, or should a rival or another Party boss decide to go after them, all of it can be gone overnight.

You can't do anything with BTC in your Bitcoin-QT wallet when you can't exchange those BTC for goods and services. Goods and services all require real-world resources. Time, skill, and materials don't come for free, out of nowhere. Right now you can more or less only trade fiat currency for real world materials. People are only trading BTC for goods and services because they can exchange those BTC for fiat. 
This isn't hard to figure out. What are even drug dealers going to do with BTC and its protocol if they can't exchange it for cash? 
Dealer buys a pound of weed for $1,200 and sells it for 16 BTC. It works because he can trade 16 BTC for ~$1,800. If he can't, he's not going to go to a grower and get another pound in exchange for the 16 BTC number showing on his wallet when the grower requires thousands and thousands of dollars worth of equipment, time, and risk to produce weed.

Getting crushed by huge DDOS is not necessarily trivial to deal with. 
Think about how many buys per day Gox runs, and then realize they're raking 0.6% (or less, with volume discounts) on each buy, and then understand why it's definitely in their best interest to have trading open as much as possible. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 22:33:54
That's pretty much like saying people who are buying 2MM+ worth of BTC aren't entitled to sell them at their leisure and then rebuy again at the deflated price. 
If anything needs to change it's that Gox needs to get their shit together regarding their servers so that there isn't 6m+ trade engine lag every time someone holding a large amount of coins/fiat executes a large buy/sell.

Because you think of the Chinese Communist Party as if it's a normal government in a normal country. It's not. It's a mafia that seized control of a country by using political rhetoric as a front. To understand what it's up to, you have to understand that difference. 
There are many factions within the Party, and that's even more true at lower levels. One operates against another for self interest while they all know the Party's rule can collapse at any time. Nobody has any ideology or loyalty to anyone else, not the country, not future generations, not the neighbours, it's all about self interest.

If you're going to buy you're only going to be able to buy ~4 BTC at present prices. This is fine, but you have to think about how high the price needs to rise for you to have meaningful profit. 
For you to double your money the price would have to approach the zenith of the last bubble, and you still won't really double because of Gox and payment processor fees. 
So for someone like you, you're either investing $500 into BTC for a long term investment or you're okay with a very, very narrow profit margin in short term, small ball trading. 
Since you mentioned being able to live on tips in between cheques I would advise that your $500 is worth more in your pocket if you aren't buying BTC for a serious long term investment.

ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit. Application Specific meaning they're designed from the ground up to only do one thing. All they do is hash the SHA256 algorithm Bitcoin uses. They are totally useless for all other purposes. 
This computing power that's being created and used for this wouldn't have been created and used for anything else. You can't Fold and you can't SETI with them. 
Also, what this mining hardware is, _is_ the Bitcoin network. The miners process all of the transactions on the network. What this investment into Bitcoin mining really is is investment into the infrastructure of a huge global Internet currency.

You can either buy 
1. GPUs
2. FPGAs
3. ASICs
GPUs are absolutely worthless to buy now for BTC mining. You'd have to mine LTC and trade them for BTC. You can expect to bring in like $500/m worth of LTC/BTC at current prices/difficulty for a $2.5k investment. 
FPGAs aren't easy to get, aren't easy to set up, and they aren't cheap. They also usually aren't faster than GPUs. Their main advantage is that they use way less power than GPUs. They'll be obsolete in 2-3-4 months as mass amounts of ASICs come online. 
ASICs are almost impossible to obtain right now. You can pick up a Blade from Asic Miner for ~$6,500 at current BTC prices, which will probably never recover 100% of its BTC cost. You can try to bid on the BFL Jalapenos that are for sale on Bitcointalk but they're already 25BTC/each and cap at 5.5GH. The rest is waiting on Avalon/BFL to actually ship (forget it if you don't have a preorder from 2012 minimum) or buying Avalon chips in a group buy and trying to get them assembled in another group buy. 
BTC mining is in a very bad place for the common person right now. Your friend is going to lose a lot of money, but if he doesn't listen to reason, that burden is all his.

When you put in the 1,000B buy order at market, all of the orders in the order book up to 1,000B are filled until the order is complete. 
So this means that there can be dozens or hundreds of transactions processed across different accounts as the order is filled, which is why whenever a market order comes down there's serious lag.
Those huge lag numbers you see are just the API releasing an erroneous trade engine lag figure while its under peak load.

Don't kid yourselves. The way they'll quash Bitcoin is to make it illegal for financial institutions to process transactions from companies dealing in bitcoin. (see: Unlawful Internet Gaming Enforcement Act in the US, targeting online poker, passed through as a rider to a port security bill guaranteed to pass because the guy taking bribes from lobbyists had the power to do that on very short notice)
Makes no difference how secure or cloud-based the BTC system is. If you can't exchange it for fiat it's worthless because you can't pay rent or buy food with BTC pretty much anywhere.

I want to tip on subreddits besides this one because it promotes Bitcoin, but I don't want to pay the writer of the bot 0.15B to do it.

Group buy on 0-day account that refuses to use escrow = scam 100%. Period.
