I've used okpay to fund my ibwt.co.uk exchange account, you should have no problem getting your funds back

I'm from the US and recently found ibwt (ibwt.co.uk). You can get USD in through the different okpay methods

The 'drug war' is a crime against humanity, millions have died in the name of corrupt greed, you people with your pro prisons and using the drug war to demonize generations of youth so you can keep them impoverished and push your prescription killer drugs (which now kill more people than 'illegal' drugs), you make me sick. 
Ross has a clear understanding of the realities,  either you're a dumb smuck or you're one of the damn evil sociopaths pushing legal highs and/or addictive prescription drugs onto a suffering population.
End the war! End the tyranny!  End the greed &amp; corruption! Education, not demonization! Free the children and the next generations!

Same shit going on in the UK and has been for a while, no one gives a crap, the ibwt exchange has found numerous ways past retarded banking blockades.
