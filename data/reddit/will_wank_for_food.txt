it may be a good time to keep a close eye on the exchanges

that is fair, but BTC is still traded on a market. i'd assume the majority of people who currently own or utilize BTC have a better understanding of its current position. it may deter new players from entering, but like you said - with time.

in short, purchasing btc directly. 
although your points are valid, per se, I still highly recommend you continue to educate yourself about bitcoin before getting ahead of yourself. based on your statements it's clear you have a misunderstanding, or at least a lack of knowledge on bitcoin. that's not a knock either. just read up!

if you're trying to time a market, you're going to have a bad time.

The way I see it? You requested to purchased a "product" form a vendor, who never provided you with said product. What's stopping you from putting a fraud claim in with your bank?

As a Bitcoin NOOB, can someone please explain the following to me: What is stopping someone from purchasing Bitcoins on Mt Gox, transferring it to their given wallet, and then transferring it to another exchange (e.g. Bitstamp) and selling for a pretty sweet premium? Excuse me if I'm just completely ignorant to the situation!
