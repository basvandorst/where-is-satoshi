If you keep 99% of your money in something that has been used as money for 6-7 years, quite frankly you deserve to lose 99%.
Basic risk management required here.

No, you don't get it - mass adoption will happen for whatever can be anonymous without "enough effort", but effortlessly.
Monero is this coin and not Bitcoin.

No, because Satoshi is likely the FBI/CIA.
But humor me this, how come we do know who was behind Silk Road...
And see this:  
  
  
...and this:  
Bitcoin - Anonymous... think again!

Why make "a little effort" - which actually is more than just a little, when a better way is available out of the box - **Monero.**  
  
Also, let's not underestimate the other advantages of Monero over Bitcoin:
**1. Adaptive block size. (Bitcoin is unable to solve this for over a year now)  
2. Gradual difficulty increase - better for DECENTRALIZED mining.  
3. Decentralized ASIC-ressitent mining, which means that ANYONE can mine and not just the large company miners, which have centralized and usurped the mining (and to an extend the ownership) of bitcoin.  
4. Easy forking**  
----------- all of the above are CURRENT features  
5. OPEN and DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITY / unlike the now DOGMATIC community over at Bitcoin.  
6. RingCT (probably released this year)  
7. Some other things in the pipeline that are potential future features - even smart contracts if there is a market for that - look at the Monero dev. roadmap.

**You actually do need it when it comes to mass adoption of MONEY.**  
While it is true that most people use the Internet without a VPN, and do not think twice, they would **NOT be willing to do the same with a wallet, THE BALANCE OF WHICH IS VISIBLE TO THE WHOLE WORLD.**   
...and that is what Bitcoin is, in essence.  
  
Also since most people do use the Internet without a VPN it will not be hard to connect each balance to an IP and therefore a geographical location and a **NAME.**  
  
This for the moment is the proposition that Bitcoin represents.  
  
**With Monero they can rest assured that nobody they do not specifically authorize could possibly know the balance of their wallet.**
