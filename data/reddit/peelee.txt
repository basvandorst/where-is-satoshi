Yeah it took me like 15 minutes after I walked back from the bank. Fairly quick.

Thanks again - I'll be giving it a shot.

I was going to try this tomorrow during lunch. Could you list the steps in your process? And are there any fees using the BoA deposit? Much appreciated.

As an Earthling, I find this comment confusing.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:40:38
And definitely don't listen to financial advice from people who've just read the article on Yahoo or wherever about Bitcoins. 
Roommate comes up to me and goes: "You're doing Bitcoins? It's so volatile why are you doing it? I heard it went from like thousands of dollars to like 1 cent."
Thanks for the info you pulled out of your ass, ha.

Go for it. No one really knows the answer whether to buy now or buy later - if we did we'd all be rich. Either you're in or you're out.

I am Nostradamus. I predicted someone would make the connection to the Tulip mania again after other fellow Redditors have been doing so for awhile.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:43:40
You can try BTC-E.com. The BTC price is a little lower on there and there's also ability to trade into other currencies like Litecoin. I used Bitinstant to get money on there rather quickly. Just a quick suggestion. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 18:17:14
I like getting: "So Bitcoin is backed by just trust..."
And then me saying: "Just like other currencies.."
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:34:53
I was right! I predicted someone would said they warned everyone and annoy people about it! If they were wrong nothing would happen, and if they were right they could tell everyone he/she was right! I knew it!

Oh I don't have a problem with any of this. You seem like an angry man for swearing at another individual over the internet. It's okay to pin your own emotions on to somebody else to make yourself feel superior. 
Work is letting out. I will see you on the other side.
@_date: 2013-08-01 15:03:22
Very simple. To them it's a "low risk, high reward" situation. If they bash it and tell you it's stupid, and it ends up crashing they will have their "reward", which is being able to say "TOLD YOU SO." If Bitcoin coins becomes big, then can just shrug it off and say it's still stupid.
They should say nothing. I'm putting MY money into it. Are you my financial advisor? No. I'm smart with my money. I'm not putting my life savings into it. I already placed that money aside and assume I'm going to lose it. If goes up, good for me. If it doesn't, guess what? I planned for it.
The worst is when people try to talk you out of it and have literally NO idea what it is based on some news article title they read. People will believe anything with minimal amounts of knowledge.
I've had people tell me: "WHAT'S BACKING IT?" We are. Just like regular currency. Just because government says it's "not" yet doesn't mean anything. The worst is I had a roommate come up to me and say "Why are you buying it? It's so volatile. I heard it went up to like $1,000 and dropped down to like pennies." You clearly heard wrong, and I'm not going to even bother to argue with you.
People have to be right. They don't take risks, they want to be/stay mediocre. They want everything to be steady. It's human nature to not want to reach out, and just sit there and be lazy (me included).

Thanks! Do they allow you to print out a form and you just follow the instructions? Sorry I'm at work and can't access this information right now.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:35:42
Lol it was done on purpose to show the troll-ness of your comment.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:26:42
Oh interesting. Thanks that's useful information. I'll give it a go tomorrow.

Coinbase may be slow, but I enjoy their service. They can't take in that many orders because their service is the most convenient and safest and people want to use it. I bought 1 BTC at $200 and when it dropped by the time I received it, I still only received 1. I contacted Customer Service and they reimbursed me for the BTC I would've got at the current market price ($65~). I tried buying right before the bubble and it wouldn't let me and I was so frustrated, afraid it would keep going up. 
So technically, by waiting Coinbase saved me from losing a bunch of money and I ended up still getting my BTC. Ty, Coinbase.

What I've learned on this subreddit:
* Use as much money as you're willing to lose
* Bitcoin could be $0, $200, or $10000 tomorrow

What method did you use to transfer? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:49:39
Because people want to be in the Bitcoin "bubble" or "revolution" so they don't need a Negative Nancy telling them how to spend their money. If you don't have a stake in this, leave your voice out of this. I understand you want the satisfaction of exclaiming you were right if it bursts, but please no one wants to hear it now (or then).
And by the way, saying something is true really doesn't make it true. Obama is a woman. It is "fucking true". Aw damn I'm somehow wrong.

Changes the name back to "The Facebook" and then makes it exclusive only to people who row.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:20:08
I'd like to find out this answer too. I thought after I was verified (today) I could pay now and then follow their **"Note! We've exceeded our normal buy limits for today. If you would still like to purchase you will receive the market price of bitcoin on Apr xx, 2013 at xx:xx EDT after your funds have arrived"** rule. But then the error comes about the 24 hour limit, which kind of contradicts? 
Could someone help us with an answer?
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:42:12
It's my money, and I do what I want. I want a chance at gaining more money (or lose it all, but it's okay because I only invest the amount I'm willing to lose)!
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:45:00
I'm not really understand the shares thing. It says dividends are per share, that I get. But on Bitfunder it has like 5 shares for 1.6BTC and then someone selling 1 share for 1.6BTC. If it's the same, why no buy the 5? Can someone just clarify?
Appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:28:58
Coinbase might take awhile. I suggest another method like Bitfloor.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:41:33
No problem! 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:39:40
1. Withdraw Paypal money by check
2. Cash check into bank
3. Have money in hand
4. Go to Bitfloor and do BoA deposit
5. Take money and deposit into BoA 
6. Boom. 
7. Bitcoin

I'm having the same issue. 
First off I started with Coinbase - finally got verified today, but they have limits and a long period to wait because they have so many orders. Mine won't even go through so I might just use it as a small wallet for the future (if I ever want to move money into this account and sell it to withdraw).
Around the same time I tried BitInstant at CVS to BTC-E.com (only tried $20 in case anything happened) and it worked. It's a nice option because there are other currencies to explore on their as well (like Litecoin). 
Tomorrow I'm going to try the Cash Deposit at Bank of America into a Bitfloor account. I can't keep waiting on Coinbase and I'm scared to use Bitinstant after hearing some of the issues. By the time I get a BTC on Coinbase I'll be retired. 
Hope this helps!
*PS to anyone reading this who's tried the Cash Deposit: how does Bitfloor know which account to put the money into once they receive it in their BoA account? I'm at work so some sites are blocked.*
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:21:41
Coinbase does not need verification to sell/withdraw. The only verification you need is the verification of your bank account.
Downside is you won't be able to buy quickly because they have limits.
