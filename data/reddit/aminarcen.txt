I linked a bank account, and they made their deposits. When I went to verify, however, I was told "Incorrect Deposit Amount." I know that I was putting in the correct amounts.
I decided to wait a day and give it another shot. Also, they had withdrawn the original deposit amounts from my account, which according to their website:
"Once you verify your bank account, Circle will withdraw those two small amounts from your bank account."
However, when I signed back into my account, there was still no bank account, and no verify link anymore. I emailed their support team, and received an auto "We'll get back to you soon..." reply. Shortly afterwards, I received an email reminding me to verify my account... Still nothing there, and still no reply from the support team.
I linked a credit card and tried to buy, but it was denied twice. I called my bank and the bank said "the vendor keeps sending charges through for 0.00, that's why they're getting denied."
I just sent another email asking them to close my account. Hopefully they actually respond this time... My experiment with them is drawing to a pointless close.

I did. I tried it both ways, with and without the preceding zero.  I can't do anything else at this point, as my bank account doesn't even show up anymore.  I'd just like some confirmation from them regarding what happened before I try to relink it, or just cancel my account and walk away.

Not good so far. I emailed them (support two days ago regarding my bank account disappearing from my Circle account, and I've received no response at all beyond ***Thanks for contacting Circle!***

I did, yes.  I entered them every way possible.  What's funny to me, is that what you said worked for you is the exact opposite of what said worked for him.  I'd just like a reply back from Circle at this point.
