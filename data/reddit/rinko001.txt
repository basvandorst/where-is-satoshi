I think these are two completely different things. BIP47 seems okay for a public donation address, but does not work for basic shopping. 
https is required anyway for secure web surfing and shopping, and I'm not aware of any alternative. Certificate pinning and similar techniques help reduce dependency on registrars, but I dont see how there is any viable alternative to that today.
BIP 70 allows us to receive a "receipt" for shopping: a list of what we plan to buy, how much it costs, etc, which is signed up to the same level of security as the website itself is. It also formalizes a method to inform the server where we would like any refund sent if necessary. (rather than leaving refunds/cancellation open to attack). This would allow a hardware wallet to review what it is planning to sign independently of the user's computer, among other things.
BIP47 does not do those things. 
I love samourai wallet, and you guys do have a great philosophy. But honestly: cert authorities are already involved in online shopping, and bip47 does not change that. Adding all the complexity of bip47 to shopping doesnt really add anything, since you would receive the public address from the https site anyway, and you wouldnt have a standardized receipt or refund address. In fact, the two are orthogonal: you could do bip47 over bip70 just fine.
Is there anything you think I am missing in the specification on bip70 that makes it evil? I dislike that the refund address goes unsigned, seems open to a MiM. Other than that, I dont see how it compromises privacy, or adds any new crypto other than what was already present in the online shopping experience. And Bip47 is simply for an entirely different purpose.
In any case, thanks for the reply

of doing so.
They should


support(usually via openssl) which have a large attack surface and
poor track record when it comes to vulnerabilities.
The same as https; and if that is violated you would be getting a fake destination address anyway. The pki parts can be isolated to a separate process, such as "curl", if you are concerned about attack surface. 


that which handles TLS greatly increases the possibility of keys being
leaked due to vulnerabilities in TLS libraries such as
openssl(heartbleed etc).
Once again, this can be isolated from the wallet core, and should be. And without a secure https client, there is no hope anyway. 


to the merchant increases fees and uses more block space than sending
directly since it is often not feasible for users to fully migrate
funds to a BIP70 compatible wallet.
So support the protocol and dont make users do this.


requires manual non-user-friendly workarounds such as
So, support bip 70

I dont see how that is possible, its a single mutlisig coin which must at somepoint be destroyed (be spent). The actual lightning is off-chain, within the bounds set by the channel coin.
to change that original mutlisig transaction would have to be on-chain.
Logically, this is why most lighting will go through very large channels in the centre of the network, effectively keeping things in balance.

BIP70 doesn introduce PKI per se; every single secure web transaction is already using pki + https.
If BIP70 has a flaw its that the response messages are not signed... but otherwise its just a formalized way to perform a bitcoin transaciton that doesnt have to be any less anonymous that a normal direct address send. You get to assign a refund address, which is a nice thing all sites should do anyway.
I think samourai should consider adding it. Its a nice protocol, and doesnt really have the downsides they suspect.

If overstock was presenting a universal crypto payment page, that might make sense. but they are not.
The api integration pre-dated bcashes existence. It makes no sense for a new currency they did not ask for to look like a valid payment. The user was not even presented with a bcash address, and the bitcoin network has no way to detect a bcash payment, litecoin payment, or any alt payment.
This is a clear cut case of coinbase being in the wrong. They changed the rules and went out of their way in an attempt to push bcash at their customer's expense.

Capitalist banks haven't existed since the 1700's. Even then they were a dying breed.
Profit is not exclusive to capitalist; profit is anything we do for perceived benefit. All human action is profit motivated, full stop. Trying to make profit a bad word is like trying to make suicide a good word.
Socialist banks act, like most socialists, to steal from the public rather than to serve them.
Socialist is the opposite capitalism; In socialist all transactions are theft and force, while in capitalism all transactions are voluntary and mutual. Banks today fall under socialism, they operate by force. They have little concern for mere monetary profit, and instead pursue a different profit: control.


Abolishing money would amount to such a massive economic blow that no such system could long survive. Pure communists tried this and it failed so hard no-one will ever be so foolish again. If you still maintain an anti-money position, you should first look to abolish computers, electricity, transportation, mathematics, and all other modern technologies. Perhaps run around naked in the woods with spears; this hasnt been viable since the stone age.
Modern socialists accept money, but twist and pervert it into another tool of oppression. They are not stupid, merely evil.


If everyone had money corresponding to their work/productivity, then money would be worth much more!
Money and simple savings would replace most all other forms of investment. 
Everyone having money is a capitalist nirvana, one we hope to achieve using crypto-currency.
The Banks and state socialists are the primary opposition: they wish to retain an elite ruling class and keep billions of people impoverished. The dollar, and similar socialist currencies, are the primary weapon of oppression.
I sincerely hope you realize this and stop supporting socialism.

* Its new, and some investors are scared to death of new things. 
Even a 10 year history is not nearly long enough to make some people comfortable.
* They think in dollars
Most investors are dollar blind. Dollars are money, they are the measure of everything, and they have never had to challenge or question the idea of what a dollar is.  When presented with something that challenges the very idea of how money and valuation works, they dont have the mental tools to deal with it, and cognitive dissonance is painful. 
Having to realize that the US dollar is a particularly bad pyramid scheme is not something they are ready to internalize.
* Mountains of Keynesian propaganda
So many investors go through their entire lives being indoctrinated in Keynesian ideals, and the entire previous couple of generations did as well. They are puffed up with misinformation, ideas that they have trouble overcoming because they received them from trusted authority figures. 
They think that inflation is good for the economy, while deflation bad. They think that consumer credit is a necessary part of the economy. They think that the value of money has something to do with taxes. They think that GDP is a real measure of something, and that the government reported inflation numbers are roughly correct. 
In short, nearly everything they think they know is wrong.
* Because Gold has failed
This is the most valid reason to be skeptical.
Gold, and "gold backed" currencies have failed. The CME and other bankers have neutralized gold, while the people have slowly come to see to see it as less valuable. Keynesians think that if sound money were viable, then gold should perform better than any stock. This has a kernel of truth; if gold was not so inconvenient,  and people were less willing to accept paper gold, then gold would likely outperform any stock due to its history of being "money". The dollar would be unsuitable for pricing because of its constant drop vs gold, so all prices would be in grains or grams of gold. Obviously this did not happen; gold has faded to a minor fringe asset most people dont bother with.
Bitcoin is truly a gold 2.0. If bitcoin follows in the foot steps of metal gold, it will end its run as a minor asset for decorrelated diversification.  If bitcoin can succeed where gold has failed, then it will change everything we know about finance, investing, and more.
* Ideology
The people in r/investing want horse races, they dont want someone ripping down the horse track.
They want some asset they can buy or sell, long or short, then end up with more dollars than they had before. 
They dont want ideology. They dont want an asset with political implications. They dont want a movement That could make the entire stock market cease to exist; That could make all their 10 and 20 years plans go off the rails. 
Bitcoin is like Orban's cannon perched outside their castle - it could batter down all the walls and towers they call home today.
* Scope
Bitcoin's claims are broad. what sound money would claim to do for humanity is nearly unprecedented. Its heralded as an invention that could stand shoulder to shoulder with Agriculture, Iron Smelting, The Wheel, etc.
Its much easier to dismiss fantastical claims as simply some kind of scheme or sham than to really expect that something so big is upon us.
Noone expects world changing events in advance. 
The crux of the matter for us is: will bitcoin be *the* sound money or not.

More like half-opening - assuming there is enough balance inside the total space of the channel to perform the trade. Increasing the total size of a channel would require a close and reopen. 
For example, if you opened a channel for (1BTC you, 0BTC PeerA) spent 1BTC and your channel is no longer able to send, the only way to replenishing the balance would be to reverse the direction of funds flow.
So If you send a normal transaction for up to 1BTC to PeerA, then Peer A will happily get you back to your 1BTC balance in your lighting node. 
But if you wanted to get your spendable balance up to 2BTC, then you would need to close the existing channel and open a new one.
A realistic spending hot wallet model would be to load up the wallet with a couple weeks, or a month (or longer) worth of spending money, then perform a single transaction to replenish it from cold storage This could take down the total number of transaction fees paid to one per month, for example, for thousands of transactions. 
As long as the total amount moved in either direction doesnt exceed the channel capacity, then you can reuse the lighting channel for as long as the peer is willing.

Its actually super encouraging, because alts are a risk to the whole ecosystem. 
The natural state of a successful crypto currency revolution is a single blockchain, with various valued added features built on top of it. 
If the world cannot settle on a single chain, then there will be no security, and the system will always be vulnerable to attacks.
Luckily, the network effect strongly supports the correct outcome, and is helping to kill off the altcoins, and their features are being re-created as extensions on top of the one true blockchain.

I agree that taxes cannot be easily resisted on an individual level, but




The key part is savings; if you keep savings in dollar form, bonds, treasuries, and brokerage held stocks, then you are enabling the system.
If you hold bitcoin, physical gold, or similar assets, then you are opting out of the dollar system, and removing your support from warfare, to the extent that you safely can as an individual.
If you only hold dollars long enough to handle payments, then that has a minimal impact.
Debt and real estate are more complicated. If you hold dollar debt, but you are willing to default on it, then that defies the war machine. If you would sell all your sound assets in order to service debt, then that helps and supports the war machine.
In theory, if everyone took out the largest loan they could, bought bitcoin, then defaulted on the loan and refused to pay it back, the dollar would be broken overnight.

If you read the whitepaper, look for the assumptions about participation. In short; if participation is not near 100%, then the algorithm fails to meet its primary objective. Security falls off geometrically with participation, and approaches zero before falling to 50% 
For example; if 10 separate blockchains exist, they will not each have 10% of the security; they will have zero security because the incentive model shifts to benefit cheaters over honest participants. 
Various failed tricks, such as asic resistance and alternative PoW schemes have been tried, but all have been shown to exacerbate the problem and not solve it. In short; if we do not converge on one overwhelming consensus version of "the blockchain" then there will be no working blockchain that can provide meaningful security of consensus.

True; programming modern C++ with lambdas, auto types, loop semantics, etc makes code vastly simpler, while move semantics makes it faster. 
Its nearly a testament to the unanimous nature of these changes that they are accepted as "C++" rather than being excluded for forked to fork away from the main name. Much like bitcoin core development.
One noteworthy thing still missing from C++ is some core asynchronous continuation semantics. Imagine having async/await with C++ continuations; the power of C with the expressiveness of JS.

The byzantine generals problem; as applied to finance would be "settlement".
Knowing that a payment is valid, the correct amount, and fully and irrevocable settled is something current finance systems do not handle well, requiring huge trust overheads. Fiat money also has trouble traveling over borders or over the internet in any but very small amounts.

Then you have done more to oppose war than any 100,000 voters ever could.


fair warning: the nature of crypto currency is such that there can only be one that is successful. Rather than working with multiple coins, I would recommend you choose the one that you think is most likely to be successful, and consider that the others will be total losses.


Voting is not a fair way to decide things; inherent in voting is the idea that the people who got less votes are forced to accept the will of the people who got more. 
Instead voting, money is more fair; you can never force someone to buy or sell against their free will. If they dont want to sell their house, they wont no matter how much money you can offer.  But with a simple vote, you can steal their house. 
Hopefully, money will replace voting. Think of bitcoin as a way to defeat not just the dollar, but the system of majority voting as well. Its freedom money.

Maybe you move the problem to distributors; make them solve it themselves if they want new supply. Maybe they ask larger repeat customers to get btc for them. Maybe they hire some random people with clean records to buy X thousand BTC through various normal exchanges or systems with their real identity, in exchange for a percentage.

Good post. The difference between people who do an do not understand money is like to the differene between the sleeping and the awake.


The network effect of money is amazingly powerful; it reinforces itself until the origin of value is lost. the dollar has value, because other people accept it as having value, because other people accept it as having value, and so on. 
It maintains its value despite the massive amounts of fraud and graft, despite the simple and obvious unfairness. Some people have the power to print dollars at will, while you do not have that power.
But it is not invulnerable. The shock; the shock that will wake people up, is when someone refuses their dollars in trade. When something they want is for sale, but dollars will not be accepted, there appears a crack in their understanding of the world. At first they will react with anger and disbelief. There must surely be something wrong with that person, they will think. 
Then they will notice; from the corner of their eyes, the dollar steadily draining away, steadily losing its trade value in a visible way. I do not know how far away hyperbitcoinization is. But I know the clock is ticking.

There is a problem with the word "democracy" in this sentence. By your usage, democracy is undemocratic.
Democracy, as in "two wolfs and a lamb", voting, elective representatives, etc, is one meaning. Its a bad thing.
Democracy as in, "No kings or rulers, power spread out to the people" is a completely different thing.  A better name would be "liberty" or "anarchy" or "free market", because there is no voting so its technically not a democracy.
Bitcoin is very much the latter, but not the former. 
Bitcoin does not care about your votes; only economic activity matters.  Its an anarchic free market; pure liberty and capitalism.

Leverage. A loan is like shorting the dollar, but using other people's money to do it. 
Imagine going to vegas, and being able to gamble on credit. If you win, you get to keep what you won. If you lose, you declare bankruptcy and pay nothing. There is really no downside. 
If more people catch on the dollar wont last long.  Of course; it only matters if the imaginary dollars are used to buy actual bitcoin. if he leaves the BTC on an exchange, well, then it doesnt matter at all because he doesnt really have any bitcoin. 
Buying fake bitcoin (on an exchange) with fake dollars (loaned) works out to nothing much. Since there is no such thing as "real" dollars, that is the best case scenario for the dollar. But if you buy hard BTC (in a wallet you control) with dollars then it causes an upward pressure on the price of btc vs the dollar.

Bitcoin is not deflationary per se; its stationary. Its the economy itself which grows or shrinks, causing a reflective action on the money. 
the natural deflation you get in periods of economic growth and expansion helps to slow down and even out growth, and discourages malinvestment. 
The natural inflation you get in a decline helps encourage rebuilding and more radical investments.

Is charging interest on money even needed in a bitcoin economy?
Given two assumptions:
* The economy is growing and productivity increasing
* The growth is reflected in steady deflation of bitcoin prices (2%-4% per year)
Then any loan denominated in bitcoin would have "interest" baked in, without increasing the quantity of satoshi owed or charging any overt interest rates, the real cost to replace the borrowed bitcoin would naturally increase over time.
Edit ~ the answer is yes; even with deflation there is still a need for interest and loans

Money is ideally a signaling method for trading goods and services, but good and services are not necessarily a signal for money valuation.
Money is largely affected by its fungibility, durability, velocity, quantity, etc. It is not an end in itself, but a means of communication. Noone particularly wants an arbitaty amount of money; they want the goods and services that money could buy.
Money is ideally not "distributed" or "allocated" but traded. 


All value decisions are externalities, and externalities impact value decisions. the key point is that there is no universally correct value decision. Drawing a line and saying "these things didnt impact this particular value decision" is arbitary, and will always describe the majority of the universe. so the concept of externalities is largely useless.

That is utterly unimportant... And it has a huge upside for compatibility short term.
Looking forward long term, signatures will like be massively combined, such as with schnorr or mimblewimble; so eventually they would be separated out anyway for huge efficiency savings.
also, you can still serialize a transaction and its signatures into a single message for transmission/sharing/etc.

Its not just bitcoin, also stocks, real estate, and similar things. Stocks are behaving strangely of late however, perhaps due to QE, perhaps due to the rise of index funds; they seem historically overpriced to me right now. 
Real estate is always good when you are smart; but i think the average person does not possess the skills and political connections needed to become a real estate magnate.

Its mostly market behavior; combined with the fact that most of the big fees are overpaid by services that rather than waiting or batching continue to fight fees uphill.
Non-critical transactions that could be batched/delayed until fees cool down a bit would help to reduce volume. More aggressively lowering fee's by replying upon corrections such as RBF/CPFP can be used to test the water with lower fees.  But these are not deployed by the systems which generate most transactions. Really the only people who respond quickly to fee pressure are regular users who might delay personal spending.
In short; be it a spam pump, or media blitx causing a frenzy, a miner pullback, or any sort of instigating event, the ecosystem reacts slowly. So once the fee market is white hot, it takes a while to cool down.

Wouldnt you see the two as mutually incompatible? It will be hard to mint new dollars if their value plummets so fast that they contain no trust value.
There can still be lending of bitcoin, just not fractional lending of it I suspect.
Lines of credit, old school ones like bar tabs or informal IOU's have always worked in absence of money creation. Something like a credit card could still work; and much closer its original purpose. Credit is still a good concept; imagine credit cards just like today, with similar guarantees and fees, and similar settlement times, but denominated directly in crypto (once it is more stable than fiat) 
I think the addiction to centralized money creation can end, without causing adverse effects on the economy.

You cannot stop people from signing things they have the ability to sign. And until a transaction is immortalized in a block, then all signed transactions are equal.
The reason why we separate the signature from the thing being signed, is because *any* valid signature serves the same purpose, and the details of the random data included in the signature are not important.
When the signature itself can change the identity of the thing being signed, then you have introduced malleability. When you try to build things which depend on the identity not changing, then it fails. 
For bitcoin, this meant that for years you could not spend unconfirmed change easily. It also mean building complex contracts was impossible. With segwit we have LN and atomic swaps out of the gate, and who knows what else.
Its not amazing; its just basic. It means we no longer have to suffer for a mistake that even a first year cryptography student wouldnt make.

True, you are absolutely correct. To avoid the religious ban on interest, there might have to be an origination fee, or some other quid pro quo to motivate the lender in the first place. Perhaps it would be a share in the profits of a venture. It does boil down to interest defacto. 
Expected deflation would perhaps allow for a lower real rate of interest, but that is perhaps offset by the fact that you cannot loan imaginary money and so the losses are always realized fully.

It seems like a terrible trade still; A college degree is just about the most overpriced thing on the market, and unless you need to get into a very specific field its a bad deal. Most people would be better served with a trade school or community college.
Furthermore, student loans are readily available. Its never wise to buy with cash what you can buy with leverage, because future dollars are always cheaper than present ones. 
So trading away hard btc for soft fiat in a rigid 529 saving account, for the purposes of spending on one of the most overpriced things fiat can be spent on, and for which debt creation is over-abundantly available, seems.... like the opposite of everything money is about.
So while its nice that this person "reached their moon", imo this is not the moon at all. Its more like departing from the moon and going back down.
Especially the closing comment:


Bitcoin is not about the rising price, or capturing a bubble and dumping. Its not some vegasy thing. 
Bitcoin is about savings, and long term control of your wealth, and ending the destructive cycle of debt. fiat is about leveraging debt to concentrate wealth to your self. Selling bitcoin early, and holding fiat early in order to spend it later, is a double opposite; swimming upstream and against the wind at the same time. 
The paths to wealth are saving bitcoin (or other deflationary assets) for later spending, while borrowing fiat for later earning. 
When people do the opposite i feel sad for them; because spending hard earned wealth early and ending up with a pricey 4-year degree which is increasingly of questionable value and guarantees nothing... is not the path to wealth imo.
If risk tolerance is the thing; then selling most of the crypto in exchange for a basket of stocks is better; and planning to use the most cost effective  (i.e. cheap) education combined with student loans with the best interest rates makes for the best overall risk exposure. By the time the student debt is being paid, salaries will be significantly higher while the traditional investment will nearly certainly outpace the debt. And if even a tiny fraction of bitcoin is left it may outpace all of the above; by holding parity value vs world productivity growth. (while all altcoins go to zero)

But the economy doesnt always smoothly grow; sometimes there are natural disasters, floods, etc. In those periods, people who might normally save would instead spend; and this would amount to bitcoin inflation because the increased money velocity and decreased amount of goods and services effect inflation. In such a time, holding bitcoin would be less attractive than investing in some form of disaster relief project.
So it is not correct to say that bitcoin is deflationary; its more accurate to say that economic growth causes bitcoin to deflate.

Im not sure I would agree with that definition; mainly because there can be no universal arbiter of what is "right", and money itself is subject to market forces; it is not a quantum of anything.
The economy consists of goods and services which are traded. Money is simply a communications system layered on top of that. fiat currencies, stocks, bonds, and similar instruments are not as good as bitcoin is; and it may make all of them obsolete, and in the process free up tremendous amounts of wasted effort.

Why ? Being on-chain or off chain isnt useful at all; What makes a loan secure is some ability to enforce terms in case of default. For example, if the loan is to finance a warehouse purchase for a business; then what matters is getting agreement from the local law jurisdiction to enforce terms for repossession of the property in case the loan payments are not made.
You dont particularly need on chain crypto for that; because it cannot be machine enforced so what is the point. The actual loan and payments however can be.
This is the main mental breakdown of the Eth crowd, aside from the whole turing complete nonsense which continues to embarrass them.
If you are talking about an electronic property (which somehow calls for a loan) and machine enforcement, you could have a contract language; but it would be off the main chain or sure; and most definitely not in a turing complete language.

Sure; people who value what money can buy trade it away to people who have plenty of stuff but want to store value for the future. 
You could say that about any currency; and thats exactly what early banks did; they made for convenient settlement of large transactions.
Lets not conflate this with speculators seeking an investment; or even with businesses seeking to optimize inventory with leverage. Those are services built on top of banking.


A transaction can just as easily be a loan. When you lend a friend your loan mower the only difference from giving him the mower is the agreement that he will return it at some point.
This is of course irrelevant; borrowing and lending are radically overused in todays society because of instant money printing. If a loan required hard reserves it wouldnt be done so haphazardly. 
I think ending the damaging credit cycle with its booms and busts will be quite beneficial to the economy overall. Bitcoin works with natural inflation and deflation to moderate the economy through growth and natural disaster recovery phases both.

Money is a shared illusion. But dont forget that applies equally to fiat currencies as to any other money as well, new or old.

Chartalism is fairly weak theoretically and historically. fiat money is not created by tax demand, but generally by debt issuance.

To be fair, the same question would baffle even more people if the subject was the dollar.

And that banks have generally not given out loans to people or organizations who plan to create large capital investments or to hire or build out staff. 
Instead, venture capitalists have largely footed that bill where it is done meaning no inflation. I presume that the banking cartels have learned that lending leads to loss of control, so they have decided to keep lending in control in order to not have a financial "event".
At the same time; this gives them a new power. they can target inflation sector by sector. So you can inflate real estate, college education, retirement funds, pension funds, and stocks/bonds without inflating oil or wheat. 
the Fed's long standing policy learning, unemployment, can also be effectively targeted; the fed and the government together can ensure that employment remains high regardless of the real productivity of that work. (since the goal is control and not growth per se) 
the final result is a nice and neat extraction of all real wealth creation due to productivity growth, without losing control of the system. The technique is fine tuned, stable, and shows no signs of any shock event being imminent or even on the distant horizon.




What will cause a "next time around" ? Why would they get money into smallfolk's hands, when the new meaning of helicopter money is now dumping money directly into securities markets ?

Prison is the ideal socialist society: free housing food and healthcare (all the essentials make a perfect safety net) Stringent controls on weapons, guns, speech, and other risky things (for inmate safety) Work is for extra spending money from the highly regulated commissary. (regulated to protect you) The warden and guards form the government, and they are fully trusted to protect society, so they get all power. Also, you are not allowed to leave, for your own good.

Open a spend channel to any popular node containing the amount you wish to spend over time, in order to save on fees. If you spend 10 btc / month, open a channel for that.


Open large channels with various nodes, charge fees on interchange

I suspect in the end, due to future signature combining schemes, it would have eventually happened anyway.

There is only so much that can be done; 
Legal USD to BTC exchanges require copious amounts of unfriendliness and are required to hassle you by law. Furthermore, due to the nature of the regulations, coinbase has established a defacto regulatory capture, and can elbow competitors out of the market (good bye circle)
So, what we have is an abusive government granted monopoly (coinbase) which is collaborating with ver-b-trash scammers to essentially kill and coopt the market they are extracting rents off of.

Its a security vulnerability to send funds to a single address more than once.
the modern way to do a paperwallet is to generate a bip44 compatible mnemonic with dice, a trezor, or any compatible wallet client (12 or 24 words) print out a QR code for the first 10 or 20 addresses, and use each a maximum of one time.

Primarily is is a privacy problem yes. But, it can easily lead to loss or compromise of funds. A  a good number of basic cryptographic strengths are lost, such as quantum resistance. If you were around in the early days, many people would load a paper wallet up, spend from it, then expect it kept the change value - which the wallet software would have sent elsewhere without the user really understanding.

The hope for an ETF is that it would allow a faster and more direct fiat leak than cash nnetworks, ACH type networks, wire transfer, and credit card type networks have allowed so far. 
Brokerage networks routinely work with far larger amounts than any of the above, and also they have access to pools of fiat which are otherwise inaccessible.
If you visualize the dollar as a dam, holding back a great big volume of "value", then an ETF tradable on brokerages would be a great big gaping hole in that dam. The existing holes are smaller, and rate limited, so the end result is the same without the great big hole, it will just take longer.
Eventually, all the value will leak out of fiat, and the excitement for an ETF is that it would speed things up. In the long run , exchangablity to dollar instruments becomes pointless.

Furthermore you are pretending like stockes arent correlated.

All human chosen passwords are negative. Its a security risk because it can leak information, it is unstructured, and it is non-mnemonic so they can be easily forgotten.

Absolutely. 
When you withdraw bitcoin to your own control that is the very first instant in which you really own it, and the first instant in which you contribute to real demand. 
Since price is a function of supply and demand, withdrawal from an exchange is the only way to cause upward price pressure.
Conversely, when you deposit to an exchange, those coins are immediately available to shorters and rehypothecators, so depositing to an exchange pushes the price down, whether you actually trade or not.

The fed prints arse tons of money, which is used to buy us treasuries and mortgage backed securities. Banks and investment firms then move their port folios over to stocks, and continue to provide real estate/auto loans but do not lend broadly into small businesses/startups/projects/lines of credit which would leak inflation into the broader market.
Asset prices serve as collateral for credit, and underlie the value of stocks while they remain listed on balance sheets. Strong asset prices allows the debt cycle to continue mounting rather than to crash. A weakness in assets quickly translates into an inability to continue credit, an inability to spend, a loss of income, an inability to pay existing debts, forces liquidation of others assets, and leads to a massive orgy of deflation. 
Across the economy, deflation is when everyone rushes to convert everything they own into dollars, and then to destroy those dollars.  QE fights deflation by pushing up asset prices and thus prevent the crash from starting. 
 
QE is when Wile.E.Coyote runs off the edge of cliff but does not fall, because he does not realize he is off the cliff.  It buys time for debt restructuring, income redistribution, and slow inflation.... in other words, it buys time for Wile.E.Coyote to get somewhere safe before he falls.

No, its really not ideal and they aren't designed for it.
If you do this, you will face subtle bugs such as synchronization issues, double use of addresses, and possible failures like double spend attempts.
These arent going to lose your money on their own, but they could cost you money in concert with shitty web services like bitpay, if you are attempting to pay for something and it causes a timeout.
It may also cause you to need to do some coin control and cleanup if things go wrong, or if you dont know how to do that, to reinstall your wallet software.
Overall, the best bet is dont do it.
If you want to share funds, perhaps create two wallets, then share a master public key with each other (zpub). That way the two separate wallets can function normally, but you can both see each other's transactions.

So there will always be demand for Layer 1, and always be sufficient role for the miners. Anyone who has read the whitepaper sober has had this realization right away. Bitcoin is a strong trustless settlement layer which relies on a rich ecosystem of L2/L3 layers for scale.
The leaders of the "everything on the L1" bcasher crowd seems to be strictly non-technical types, who are clearly not qualified to make engineering calls.

Volume traded on its own has very little meaning.  It all depends on what prices the trades happen at, and what the willingness to buy and/or sell is at each price level. 
For example; if most of the market is centered around 6500, with very little sell support around that, then 400m could move the price up to 8K (assuming yale has a taste to buy at 8k)
While if there is a lot of new sell volume that comes online above 6500, it might not move the price at all.

They are not; they can be double spent. In theory, if anyone every used bcash, it could have congestion. In theory, if it wasnt centrally mined, you could have zero fee transactions. 
RBF allows a variety of fee replacement techniques, such as automatic rebatching for busy wallets.  Its a very nice feature for real blockchains.


You are a technology newbie if you think so. bcash doesnt even have segwit; its miles behind in pretty much every way possible. If you have any basic coding skills why dont you take a peek at their repsective github repositories and see whats going on.
And even if you use bcash for transactions, be very careful about holding it until the fate of bitmain is clear over the next 6 months. If they are foced to liquidate bcash it could collapse to near zero value.

For people with the option to get direct deposit; that works better for them, and they can buy BTC with far lower fees.
However; there is a reason why people use this service. Its one of the ways you can get paid even for US work even if you cannot get a US bank account and the employer is not willing or able to send to you directly via inernational wire. Of course, it would be far more optimal all around if the employer was willing to buy BTC themselves and send it to the employee - but very few employers are prepared to do that.

TDLR: the merkle tree that proves the structure of a block is intact includes "leaf treenodes" which are individual transactions, and "inner treenodes" which are not transactions just hashes of other transactions id's. 
If you can make a specially crafted individual transaction such that it looks like a normal leaf transaction to full client, but can misinterpreted as an inner node by spv-client, then you can extend a tree of fake payments underneath it and SPV clients can be fooled into accepting them as part of the block.
Doing this however, requires and lots lots of mining and hash grinding so is not particularly likely to ever happen. also, only SPV clients can be fooled.

Various reasons; if the harddrive is taken out or attacked separately, with a hardware wallet its separated. If there is an obscure vulnerability, such as a side channel timing attack, then the hardware wallet being physically disconnected and powered off most of the time help.  
SPECTERE and MELTDOWN, which are constant sources of new exploits also require constant vigilance, so having a separated ARM chip which is immune to those attacks is a nice extra layer. 
To have comparable security to a hardware wallet with computers only you would need a snearkernet between two computers. A snearket to a cold wallet + trezor is still viable, even then.
TL;DR a hardware wallet still adds some layer of security, but it pales into comparison with using linux.
For very small amounts of money (say less than 0.1 BTC) a hardware wallet or cell phone wallet might be good enough, but for anything more you have to start with a linux.

Exactly right; directly performing payments is really the least important thing about btc. So long as people use it for savings, its working as intended
Even with BTC denominated payments being outright banned, you could have apps that convert the fiat price instantly to a satoshi amount, and make the payment without ever needing to touch real Đong.
It would be like doing an instant fiat buy, coupled with an instant fiat sell on the other side. For example: 
* I want to buy something that cost 10K VND from you
* you give me the the product, and now I owe you 10k VND
* You then buy 10K satoshi from me using the 10K VND that I owe you
* I give you the 10K satoshi, and the debt is settlẹd
The only problem would be that event VND is falling so fast that prices become unstable.

Maybe not; that is your opinion. But for the people like satoshi, the people who push for sound money, they certainly think its going to solve those problems. 
Maybe you think this whole movement is pointless or overblown,  but at least recognize that the people at its core, and a great number of people who are joining and understanding its potential, see things differently.
They do believe that sound money is the answer to the major problems of our day.
There are problems from the past; transportation, communication, famine, plagues, etc which have been solved with technologies of the past. The biggest problems of today are the ones I listed before. Perhaps once we can get past the problems of today as a species, humanity will be free to move on to future problems, such as fusion energy, exploring the cosmos, or overcoming the limits of FTL travel or communications
IMO, sound money is the required technological next step to move forward as a species. That means bitcoin, for us, is potentially the most important development, and the most crucial technology to develop, assuming it can be sound money.
So you may not share our expectations or enthusiasm, but at least you can understand why people are so optimistic about bitcoin and it potential.

Asking once is enough. Buying and selling things in bitcoin is a second step, its not nearly important as savings. Hodling bitcoin will make the revolution come, and it is the only crucial factor in whether bitcoin succeeds or fails. 
I know some altcoiners are extremely focused on transactions and commerce, but that gives a coin zero staying power. Its just not important in the grand scheme of things. How you store value over time matters; that is the source of value to a currency. That is the source of moneyness.
The most important person to convince is really yourself: you hold the key to making the change more so than others, and your personal actions can have an outsized impact. Have you converted your cash savings to bitcoin? 
Personal risk levels mater; and I would not suggest for someone who is afraid to take risk to convert more of their wealth into bitcoin than they are comfortable with. And learning how to safely hold BTC becomes more and more important with the amount you hold. And holding on an exchange counts for nothing, so never do that.
But if you are ready, replacing some or all of your investments and savings is a great start. Everytime you get rid of stocks, bonds real estate, CD's and idle cash in banks and money market accounts, you shift the balance of power.  I would only suggest keeping your emergency fund in whatever form is most stable for covering a few months expenses. 
Someone who holds as much of their long term savings and personal wealth in bitcoin is an agent of change - they are the ones who will bring on a new freedom in our times. Asking stores to take it, in the big picture, doesnt matter than much. When the time comes, you wont have to ask.

"Democracy" leads to elitism. Its that same corrupt goverment you cite one sentence back.
The awakening that bitcoin brings is that "your vote doesnt matter, only your actions". 
Youve heard of "vote with your wallet", right? Unlike ballots, monetary votes actually cost something and impact your life - they have meaning. So you wont waste your votes on topics you dont really care about or ones that do not really affect you. Thats why capitalism is superior to democracy.
When people can vote on things they are not well informed of or directly affected by, then use the force of death to coerce others to honor those vote, then you can easily see how it an be manipulated into a crony system we have today. 
When you vote with your wallet, people who disagree with you are not affected at all! Its a voluntary system.

No; it was never a "payment system" the likes of visa or paypal or LN. Bitcoin is first and foremost a money, and Satoshi understood that perfectly well. an L1 payment would actually be called a "settlement" in fiat terms, and is closer to a wire transfer than anything you would call a payment system in fiat.


The real risk is getting stuck with paper fiat. The true magic of fiat are legal tender laws; if you advertise a price in VND, its very difficult to say no to actual paper VND, then you get stuck with that shit. An electronic payment system which secretly uses loaned fake fiat and is settled later cannot be blocked; you would also have to block credit cards which work exactly like that.

Yes, this would be the only way to ensure you have maximum privacy. Even without it, its not as bad for privacy as scanning a full wallet, since you are just checking one address that you dont even own.

Those two points are actually just one point.


Imo, that is demand-side keynesian misinformation. Printing money does not spur the economy; it distorts it. Think of any decision you make in normal daily life: would you do it better with a gun to your head?
Bitcion/sound money and inflating fiat are fundamentally at odds: you cannot have both in one economy for long because it is not a stable equilibrium. 
To have inflation; you need a central power who can rig the game. When central control reigns, Gresham's law prevails. If people have a way to opt out of inflation, they do it, and Thier's laws reigns. There really is no middle ground, except for transitional periods like the state we are in now. 


This is a misunderstanding of how "backing" works; backing was just a way to steal to fund wars or corruption. It was a way to take people's trust of gold and "print" more gold without earning it. 
During the US civil war and even the revolutionary war, the government would confiscate assets it wanted to use for the war. They would issue "gold backed" currency in return, because they didnt have the actual sound metal to give. It is a band-aid over theft, and over the decades it has changed from a once-in a while theft to a constant continuous drain on the economy. 
Inflation is the biggest economic retardant possible; The reason it can persist is because the people who benefit from it tend to be the people with the most power and influence, so they have a huge vested interest in propagating it forward.

I wonder if you realize this, but the IRS will want your ass on a plate if they find out about this plan.

you could also end up bagholding dollars here, and bitoin is not required to drop again.


Once again bagholding USD is not a smart plan. Dollars are guaranteed to drop, sometimes slowly like the past 20 years, but sometimes very very fast. 
If you are going with legacy financial instruments, you should do something more traditional like a normal investment account.
If you plan to get into BTC, its far safer to just hold that first btc indefinitely and slowly accumulate more from your income. This is both safer from a risk and tax risk point of view.

There are not really any good fiat transfer methods for the US. Fiat is too centralized here so fiat exchanges have to be. 
Cash used to work okay, but random local law enforcement started harassing lbc traders.  They did the same thing with gold: tons of personal info needed to buy/trade it, and getting caught with even a small amount gets it confiscated without a trial or even honest records kept. In the US the police are essentially allowed to confiscate any bearer instruments they come across with impunity. (cash, jewels, crypto, metals, etc)
the best way to use bitcoin in the US is to never involve fiat at all. Earn small amounts of btc, and spend btc directly, never exchange for dollars. 
This is going to slow down bitcoin adoption outside of the official registered KYC exchanges. I suspect that is the intention: to make sure bitcoin holders can be identified for phase two.

Blockchain is not just a word; there is a meaning there. Libra doesnt meet the definition; First off there are no blocks. They dont really need blocks for anything, because:  second, there is no consensus algorithm. Their proof of stake algorithm isnt even implemented or defined.

The dollar itself is a shell containing the dollar. That is the whole point of the thesis: a dollar is a shell of a dollar, so another shell does not change its essential nature. 
The dollar is an empty box containing a promise for another empty box. IOW: there is no there there.


Normal US dollar bank money can only exist in a few specially blessed mainframes. There are actually shockingly few of them. 
Your cell phone cannot hold a real bank dollar. Your home PC cannot hold it. You cannot build an independent clearing house for the dollar. 
But al of those things can hold real USDT, and without any special permissions.
CASH is a similar thing; it is less centralized, but it cannot move over the internet at all, so it doesnt even factor as a competitor. It only works on sneakernet.
If you wanted to setup an online exchange that traded BTC &lt;-&gt; USDT, you could do it right now. you could even do it informally, using your cell phone. But if you wanted to trade USD for BTC, you would need a bank to give you access to the special blessed mainframes. 
So in that sense, USDT is actually superior to USD.

Just by decoding the transaction there is absolutely nothing you can be sure of. There are a million ways to leak private keys via nonce selection, and they are completely indistinguishable from a legitimate signature.
You can start by avoiding MS windows, and instead use a mainstream popular wallet on a linux computer, for example a trezor. This takes you 99.9% of the way to safe.

Are you asking how to move data out of airgapped computer?  I assume you mean the airgapped computer is your starting point, and you are going try to export the needed data from it. 
You could export all the MPKs with
* A printer
* CDRW
* USB drive
* MicroSD card
* Hand copy (Laborious)


There is no reason not to put them on the same paper. Once you have printed the QR codes onto a sheet of paper, which is the same for everyone, you could hand write one of the mnemonics onto the same paper.  since the MPKs are much less sensitive, you could make more backup copies of those too, and if any one loses their copy they could get it from any of the other participants. 
If you fail to share MPK's then remember that you need 100% of the private keys to recover, and if you lose one then the coins are lost forever. Also, unless they know how to generate the MPK's, they will have to share the private keys together, basically making it a single key system and ruining the multisig aspect of it all. 
I think the MPK sharing is far smarter. They can have various digital and paper forms available and use whatever is convenient. And you only need N signers to cooperate to get the coins recovered. 


Fair warning electrum uses funky non-standard mnemonics and wallet paths, but sometimes it will look like bip39 to trick you. You might have to fight it a bit to get a standards compliant bip84 wallet. 
I highly recommend sticking to the most standard wallet format, because who knows what wallet the people who try to recover later will have handy, so maximize the changes of success. 
Good luck.

So two parties traded either a huge block of options OTC for a slightly higher fee in exchange for privacy so we cannot see what is happening.
If this was a short sale, then someone would be allowing a large block of BTC that doesnt really exist to be sold on the exchanges - which would be a massive downward price pressure from a secret source. I doubt this is the case.
But if it is a short option, its just a private side bet with no real impact on the BTC price  - no more than a bet on a horse race changes the speed of the horses. this seems more likely because it is a closed ecosystem.
Since this is all secret, we have no idea which is happening.

it absolutely does. 
If you move bitcoin from a smart join/tumble wallet over to a "normal" one, your tumbling is pretty much undone instantly, before you even make a transaction.
More than half of the deanonimyzations of joinmarket users come from their sweep-outs. This is due to the fact that joinmarket is not a daily use wallet, so you have to sweep out to spend.

That's quite an exaggeration. there are plenty of national currencies with far worse fluctuation.  That said, there are stable currencies and commodities, which does have a value for day-to day working capital. The problem is that there can be a large barrier to conversion to use them. 


There is also a time delay, tax rate, and risk of account freeze. There are lots of barriers to fiat conversion which discourage it. 


Its certainly not limited to illegal operations, as those tend to avoid bitcoin in general especially if they are large scale its too risky. Large scale illegal operations invariably involve a bank.


Tax compliance is a complex topic; some places tend to have very low compliance, so this is a non-concern for them. 
The universal concern is paying your suppliers and employees. If you can settle wages and suppliers in bitcoin, then you never need to convert to fiat. The profit that remains can easily stay in bitcoin, especially because that is the safest form of savings anyway.
Increased stability of exchange rate would go a long way towards widening the areas of the import/export chain can be settled in btc. Right now it tends to be very short hops, especially between nations without good fiat banking infrastructure, with unstable currencies, or those which have low tax compliance/enforcement.

right; someone who will hold BTC, ideally in a 2/3 multisig address so they cannot abscond with the funds, and they can choose to finalize the payment or refund it. 
Its not terribly hard to find; but the trick is finding someone who will be trustworthy.  The only real proof of trustworthyness is reputation; so ideally you would find someone who has a known name or public reputation as being a fair escrow person.
Considering that at best it takes them a few minutes to figure out how to sign a transaction, and at worst they have to spend a couple hours sorting out a disgareement, it seems like $10-$20 is the cheapest realistic price I could imagine someone offering this service for, perhaps with a surcharge for dispute resolution of $75 ?
Reputation networks of this type are still being worked on; and as far as I know none are as of yet perfect.  You might be able to get it done with someone's social media reputation; such as their reddit username. But if they decide to go rouge they dont lose much ; that said its marginally better than nothing.
You could do the whole sale here on reddit.
1. find an interested buyer, and an escrow person, perhaps on reddit
2. Offer proof of control: buying makes up a random number and you post that number on your channel; including the intent to sell to the buyer, and perhaps a destination for the security deposit, and the name of the escrow person
3. Security deposit: the buyer pays a small fee to prove they are interested, say $25 worth of bitcoin; this can be seen publicly. Privately, buyer signs a message with instructions for how to transfer control, perhaps a gpg key
4. Create a HD multisig wallet 2/3, each person provides one zpub, confirm that the addresses match for all 3 users. confirm that the buyer's first non-msig refund address and the sellers first non-msig receive address match the same zpubs.
5. buyer sends money to the first address in the multisig wallet. all parties confirms the funds are in escrow with 6 confirmations
6. Seller transfers control of the channel to the buyer. 
7. Buyer confirms control and tells escrow agent to release the funds or
7b. dispute process begins; escrow agent examines proof and makes a decision where to send funds and what his fee amount will be.
8. funds are moved by the ecrow agent to the final payment destination

Name something you think is better for someone's life savings? Many of those "bitbois" only have a meaningful life savings because of bitcoin in the first place. 
Nothing in life is completely without risk. But bitcoin seems to be exceptionally good and safe as an investment commodity compared to just about everything else around. The only way to lose money with bitcoin is to panic sell in a correction.  
When we talk about real estate, we tell people to hold for at least 7 years. When we advise on stock market investments, we suggest at least 5 years. If you bought either of those today, I would advise double those horizons because the market is extremely overpriced for both, and the expected returns are at a historic low.

that is a risk. A few of the major exchanges try to watch transactions before and after deposits/withdraws. Sometimes is a straight hopcount, sometimes a more sophisticated ownership check of some type.
In short; anytime you deposit with them, there is a risk of quarantine funds confiscation or hold. They can pretty much do it for any reason or no reason at all.
The solution, is to never deposit with a shitty exchange like coinbase. 
Regarding coinjoins in specific; yes they may be able to detect a high likely hood of coinjoin participation, simple because the "wallet membership" of an address gets large.  Its not a perfect test, and its certainly not proof of anything. But so long as the percentage of UTXO's which are used in coinjoins is low, and most utxo's belong to "wallets" with what seems to be a reasonable number of other members, then its a technique they can use to "reduce their risk".
For bad players like coinbase, "reducing their risk" of course means impounding or even stealing your funds.
Always remember: not your keys, not your coins. When trading with someone, trust and reputation are important. When you deal with a known scammer like coinbase, you have no right to be surprised when they decide to steal from you. 
In short; its smartest to limit your dealing to counterparties with an untarnished reputation.

Could all be one piece of paper quite easily.


I dont see how that changes anything. If you use non-HD seeds instead then yes you can backup the public keys on the blockchain, but that wont help you at all for NofM HD keys. you still need a zpub for each participant, you still need to use a computer to compute the deposit addresses, you still need to give out the same number of artifacts.

Oh, no, I meant a simply wallet on your phone, like a normal personal wallet. 
you can safely install a xpub from your cold storage or trezor into a wallet such as mycelium, then each time you accept funds it goes directly to your cold storage and cannot be spent from your phone.
For example; lets assume your prices are all quoted in fiat. With mycelium; you can input a Fiat amount you want to receive, and it will generate a QR code with the right BTC amount to pay which is supported by nearly 100% of phone wallets. 
You dont need coinbase at all at this point, certainly not on your phone or tablet. 
When you go back to your office, then you can deposit what you need to your exchange of choice and convert it to the currency type you need to cover costs and expenses.  Of course, never leave anything on the exchange, just deposit what you need to convert and withdraw 100% as soon as possible.
This will maximise your privacy and your customer's privacy, as opposed to putting a middle man between each transaction.
That said; mycelium is not the 100% best for privacy, but there is no practical alternative right now that I have found to replace it. And if you need cashiers or other people to handle transaction for you, its better to integrate into your current PoS system than to trust them to use their personal phones.

The late bronze age showed a lot of empire collapses in the middle east, but certainly not all of them. And it wasnt even a noteworthy period in Chinese history. I think the boundary line is not very significant; its called out as an archeological age mainly because it changes the types of artifacts that an archeologist is likely to find laying around, not because primitive ironworking was a transformational technology. 
If anything, iron was a very slowly developing technology ; it took over a few thousands years for us to master it, and it was not a significant inflection point, imo.
In comparison, the internet and bitcoin will be a much more sudden change - within a human lifetime or two. The internet has already achieved a global transformation of society; I would argue the advent of the world network has been far more profound than that of iron working was. 
Bitcoin has the potential to be something even larger, imo. Its hard to relate what that is like... if you remember clifford stolls famous mocking essay the internet - or the ridiculous nature of startup companies during the first internet bubble, the problem was that people werent really ready to understand the impact even if you could clearly describe it to them, and even if they were technologically astute.
Even if you were knee deep in network technology at the time, you might not have predicted that the internet would become so all-consuming that people would carry around a computer/video camera/tracking device/VCR/walkman/calculator/etc/etc all day every where they went, and essentially ignore people in public places in favor of communicating over the ever-present internet instead. You might not have predicted that the average person would document their private lives in hideous detail for all to see, while porn became free as people desperate competed to show amateur porn in exchange for nothing. You might not have predicted the slow death of the shopping mall and retail outlet, in favor of all mail-order all the time.
You might have predicted "virtual reality", "3d hologram TV", or "automated highways" or hundred of things which never came about.
Bitcoin is at that point now; its going to change society in ways that even the most clued in people cannot foresee. Things we have taken for granted for hundred of years may shift.

I somewhat agree; A pure consumer might choose a reversible payment system; even assuming they were exposed to the real costs of that feature and were able to make a choice. Its nice to be able to buy from a low trust vendor online and reserve the option to pull their funds back. 
That said I feel like reversibility is a low-priority feature when repeat purchasing from a trusted vendor, most people would choose to take a discount and not pay for the purchase insurance. 
Plus, a modern reversible system would probably have more fair arbitration, rather than the current visa style challenge system which moves the losses to the party least able to pursue legal action.
Also, a modern reversible payment system would probably allow the consumer to release the payment early, rather than forcing the merchant to wait 30 to 90 days for true settlement. 
Consumer purchasing is also a small part of the market; international shipping and large container purchases would benefit greatly from bitcoin as a settlement system; rather than having to build out a large trust based mutual foreign reserves system, you could simply settle in bitcoin.
The modern banking protocols are very old, and very primitive. So I expect over the next few decades they will face rising competition from payment rails built on bitcoin.

It is used pretty heavily for portside trade, especially in asia. That still does not mean it can move electronically; it is a physical object after all.


they are not; they are on the omni network


Since by definition, it is supposed to be 1:1 for USD; then "value" is linked. That is the same for any dollar bank. that is about the only problem they share automatically.


I was clarifying; you seemed to equate physical cash printouts with USD; they are very much not the same.


By definition, every tether is outside the banking system. No official USD exist on the omni network, and no official tethers exist on the legacy mainframes.  The only link is individual people being willing to treat them identically. 
Its the same for USD cash; so long as I am willing to trade the paper notes 1:1 for bank balances, the link is maintained. Many people do not take both forms; and generally only legacy banks will convert between them safely. (anyone else offering to convert cash to bank money is at very high risk of arrest)


They did "yoink the stones". What do you think that billion dollar seizure was about? They yoinked the stones and it had no effect; the gauntlet kept working. 
Because fundamentally, at the root level, a fully unbacked tether is no different than the fully unbacked dollar. There are no "real" dollars on the omni network, or any comparable network, to compete with tethers. 
When you look at a bank balance on bank of america vs one on chase bank, you consider them to be the same. Tether is just another bank to add to that list, and its dollars are just as good as the others, and just as unbacked.

And bitcoin need a network over which to send packets. Layers, now you are getting it. Just as there is one IP layer, there is one financial settlement layer with moneyness properties.


Its was and in some cases is still used as the defacto settlement currency between nations for thousands of years. Not silver, not palladium, not uranium, just gold. It was a natural network effect. 
That moneyness is now being lost to BTC, which is taking over that role, and in our lifetimes may start to unravel fiat networks, probably starting from the weaker ones. 
If you study what money is and how money works you will realize that is is just another layer like IP.

Thats excellent. Please remember that BTC held at an exchange doesnt really belong to you. The saying "not your keys, not your coins" means that until you try to withdraw, you can never be sure if those btc are real or not. Its always best to keep your BTC under your control, and never to leave any balance on an exchange that you are not willing to risk losing.


Yes! If you accept BTC directly, such as with btcpayserver, then sell it as needed using an exchange like coinbase/kraken/etc, then you can improve your customer's privacy.
Right now, coinbase receives a lot of details about your customers and the amounts they purchase. If you instead accept BTC directly without coinbase in the loop, then your sales income will arrive directly on your phone or your trezor cold storage/etc which you control. 
At the end of a business day you can convert the amount you need into GBP to cover your costs/expenses/etc. 
This way your exchange only gets to see what they need to know, and they dont get to spy on all your sales.
 This would also mean you are less dependent upon coinbase, and you are free to switch to whatever exchange offers you the best rates.
Lastly, you can be confident that you really own the bitcoin, and that coinbase is not running a fractional reserve at your risk for their own benefit.
Anyway, just some things for you to be aware of.

They are verified the same way normal bitcoin transactions are.
Each transaction contains the sum of all money in the channel, and how it would be divided up if the channel was closed. The transactions are designed such that they could be posted to the blockchain directly even. 
In general, so long as both parties want to keep the channel open, they dont post them and instead they continue to make off block chain transactions because they are faster and cheaper. If one of the parties wants out of the channel, then close it by posting a final transaction which separates the channel funds to the two sides.

Ill try to spell it out for you:


Bitcoin transactions are valued in bitcoin. So if either demand for transaction space or value of bitcoin go down, transactions become cheaper. It cannot be both expensive and unpopular by definition. Likewise, whatever altcoin you assume people would switch to would have the equal and opposite problem. No altcoin has a better scaling plan than bitcoin; none.
Why would anyone transact with bitcion when they could use a credit card? Any transaction fee even zero cant beat rewards, plus insurance, plus sub second confirmation. If you think txfees are a deathblow then you havent really thought it out. 


Bitcoin is not an interchange service competing to offer the lowest fees per sale. It is not in competition with credit cards at all. It is a currency; a money system, and not a payment network. There are certain overlaps, but a 10 minute confirmation time would never fly with a payment network apriori. 
Bitcoins value does not flow from capturing transaction volume. It flows from demand to save; and it offers a method of transmitting value to the future self. Todays payment networks and clearance systems work better than bitcoin at the job of moving money, but they do not offer any good way to save it. Fiat currency is missing a key aspect of money. 
The future will hold integration of bitcoin into L2 payment networks; so that in addition to savings it can be a "checkings" type of money. The same thing as what happened for the dollar; debit credit and similar networks allowed faster and more convenience transmission of the currency.

A "deflationary crisis" that mysteriously never happened when the world was run on gold and silver. 
Without a bubble of artificial inflation there must invariable be a return to normal which happens when all the debt money evaporates. Since everyone has become dependent upon the bubble, you call it a "deflationary crisis" even though it is nothing more than a return to normal.
Without getting into the precarious situation of a bubble in the first place, there can be no crisis. You dont have to return to normal when you stay at it.

of course you do have to expect a certain drop off when you have fewer payment options. Some people just arent willing to do any extra work other than what they are already used to.
However, if your products are compelling, you may be able to get people to make the jump.
(1) Detailed Instructions and Guidance. This is a cheap option, and is super common on bitcoin only merchants. It can be hard to strike a balance between convenience and price however. The most convenient options (ATM's) are often charging very high premiums like 10% to 20%, while the exchanges with lower fees 2% to 5% like major exchanges, have brutal KYC steps and other signup hassles. You may also have to recommend wallet software.
(2) A first time incentive for their first bitcoin payment. This may be expensive, but if it is something compelling, you may be able to get people willing to go through the trouble.
the root cause for your problems all comes back to the same thing: those payment providers who dont want your business to survive. They work closely with regulators to make it hard for you to have any alternative, and to make it difficult and inconvenient for average people to buy and spend BTC. They want to have a monopoly on payments, and use that monopoly to control what people are allowed to do.

Gold is so inconvenient, that the risk of FRB-IOU systems is seen as less expensive than carrying real metals around. Bitcoin lacks that cost; so the real risk of bitcoin-FRB-IOU's is exposed.

While it would surely give the big financial players considerable leverage to control the price of bitcoin by artificial shorting, and possible dangerous fractional reservation, it still works out as a fiat leak.
One the whole, the amount of USD which will have access to BTC will be far higher at major brokerages, where it has a very limited availability on specialized markets.  So the pool of trapped USD which has access to BTC goes up by a large amount. 
Also, rehypothercation works for USD far better than it does for BTC.  One brokerage is not going to automatically trust another one for a deposit of BTC unless their storage provider see the actual BTC change hands. 
So realistically, any brokerage which tries to play fractional reserve games could be at a serious risk of insolvency should their timing be off. 
Lastly, individuals and storefronts wont accept BTC via brokerage, and instead require real L2 or L1 coins. So even if BTC is price inflated on the markets, real street prices in places were btc is used for commerce will pull the price upwards - and we already see that in places with an arb gap.

Dollars as we know them dont exist without it. they are the fractional reserve replacement for gold.
Gold bullion and gold coins are extremely inconvenient. That is what allow the FRB greenback to come into existence. 
Bitcoin, however, does not share the same features as gold. 
When you buy shares in a gold ETF or gold bullion, you know and expect that withdrawal of the real article will be either impossible, or else extremely expensive and cumbersome when possible. With bitcoin it is none of the above.
Any banker, such as robinhood, which does not offer real withdrawal, will suffer from mistrust. Any merchant, who can more easily accept real bitcoin not via a banker, will prefer it.
Therefore, it will not be easy to fractionally reserve bitcoin.

There is nothing handwavey about it. If you see the credit cycle/business cycle you have to admit not all credit extended investments turn out to be 100% prescient. The ghosts of Pets.com and a thousand hare brained investments would have a word with you.
Whenever you print money just to satisfy demand, you short circuit the decision making process. Its anti-market, because money printing denies the market a chance to calculate price. You are socializing the cost of the investment across the whole monetary base involuntarily, rather than waiting until someone chooses to invest with actual money voluntarily. 
This would be like creating a new product, the printing money to buy it before even making it available to the public. While you are off celebrating your profits and vacationing, your product may or may not ever be actually sold, and it might not even make it to market. Imagine if all goods and services were sold that way; it would be essentially communism with bankers serving as commissars. *forget price signals and supply/demand, lets just decide for people*
It should not be possible for the economy to "catch a cold" or simply stop working for no apparent reason. Creating a giant involuntary debt bubble against the future income of highly risky and non-market investments is clearly the major downside of inflationary currency. that is malinvestment.

I do agree that for everyday commerce there should be payment networks which have very low fees; its just that they do not belong on mainnet.

Because dollars are a very high overhead and inconvenient system. They are subject to countless laws and restrictions, complex taxes, multiple-day time delays, and all sorts of legal risks. 
It will never be possible to fluidly exchange dollars to bitcoin, because dollars have extremely high friction of transfer. Simply giving dollar change over long distances requires state and federal licensing which takes years of waiting and costs thousands of dollars, and in some states could require millions of dollars in bonds. 
Dollars should be avoided whenever possible.


there is the problem; since the store's suppliers are limited to the dollar ecosystem, you cannot avoid its overhead.

Over the longer term, dollar market crashes are absolutely inevitable. There has been, and always be, at least a mild crash once every 10-20 years. And a very major crash at least once every ~75-90 years. 
Its baked into the credit cycle, and its completely unavoidable so long as we continue to use the fractional reserve dollar.
Its not guaranteed that BTC will replace the dollar, but the dollar economy will have crashes regardless of BTC. When the stock market bottoms hard, that has been a wonderful opportunity to drop dollars and buy stocks. 
Anyway who was cash flush in 2009, and bought stocks then has had remarkable returns. Bitcoin wasnt well known then and wasnt an option for most people. The next crash will be different; noone knows how bitcoin will react. It will certainly drop a little at first, as the dollar deflates hard. What happens next is anyone's guess, but its surely going to be one heck of a ride.

Its trivial to make a bicycle for fish too, but its hard to make fish use it.
Bitcoin is trival to verify. This property makes it effectively impossible to fractionally reserve; how can you run a reserve if noone is honoring your notes?
Unlike gold with its cost and other barriers to validation, and unlike the dollar with its total lack of verification, bitcoin can be easily and instantly verified as real. 
This means for nations, corporation, banks, and even small businesses, its much safer for them to accept real BTC rather than BTC IOU's.  Especially for larger trades. They can eliminate counterparty risk at no cost.
Imagine how early paper currency would have failed if you could summon the backing gold instantly, verify it, the dismiss it to your private storage or any other bank. It would have been impossible to run a factional reserve of anything other than nearly 100%, because you reserves are constantly being plumbed.
So the point it not that its possible to write unbacked bitcoin IOUs the challenge is getting people to accept them for long terms in large amounts, and to use them in trade without verifying their existence. 
Fractional reserve is likely to be  impossible for BTC.

The best way to think of it is that the present earth has borrowed from the future one. Its a shell game, where we pretend that we can have our cake and eat it too.
When you spend next years salary by taking out a loan, say using it to buy a car, you create money and a matching debt. the money you spent is real to the people who made and sold the car, and it pays their salary.  It all sounds fine, you eventually earn the money back and pay back the debt. except in the case when you cannot pay it back because you lost your income. Maybe you cut back on some of your other spending while you job hunt, and the people who would normally profit for your spending now get nothing. Maybe the lender who counted your debt as an asset can afford to write off one bad loan.
Now image that default happening to lots of people at once, its like a nuclear chain reaction. One persons lost income results incutbacks in spending. cutbacks in spending are the next persons income loss, and so on. The people who own the debt see its value drop as more and more people default on loans. Suddenly, their income is also threatened too, and they cut back on spending. It spreads like wildfire, and the larger the debt load is the hotter it burns.
Suddenly there is noone working and noone can afford to live. Prices shoot through the roof and now you have a worldwide venezuela. 
Thats why debt matters; because everyones work and income comes from that debt, but its unsustainable and much eventually be paid back.

Its perfectly fair to them. Savers are at the tail end of deflation propagation; innovators benefit first and most. Innovators who improve market productivity are in fact the sole source of deflation, and at its leading edge they gain the most benefit. Deflation, just like inflation, propagates in waves as is not instantaneous.


False; the benefit received by savers comes precisely from the increased quantity of goods and services on the market. Its definitional; capitalism rewards those who work to improve society. Of course, if society did not improve then they would not have been rewarded in the first place. 
Unlike theft and government redistribution, the aim of capitalism is not to extract wealth strictly at the expense of everyone else in society; it is to serve society and **earn** profits in return. that service is the wonderful "free ride" that is issued to savers. 
Savers are very important, because without savings there can be no innovation or investment. 
Those who benefit the least are those who spend away all they earn and never save; they still benefit a little; as the market grows the value of their labor does as well. 
Sounds money complements capitalism perfectly; it allows the altruistic system to raise all boats in the correct proportions to award those who serve others the most. 
On the contrary; inflation money essentially awards cronyism and political privilege. Its exploits those who work, lavishes riches on those who direct the money/debt system, while offering lukewarm returns to those who understand the nature of debt over productive assets and have at least middling access to credit. It retards capitalism, and is only efficient in producing engines of war.

There isnt a second application for blockchains except crypto currencies, because all the other applications shown for altcoins so far work better without the actual coin itself. Due to the nature of money, there is a worldwide market for exactly one decentralized money.  So, if you had to guess, which one do you think will win out?
Bitcoin is:
* First to market, most entrenched
* Most developers
* Largest ecosystem and economy
* Best technology
* Most focus on the real use cases for blockchain
* Has a working layer2

Transaction count is proportional to population, its not that hard to see. Older forms of sound money, gold and silver, seem to have had little trouble dealing with population increases.

You are mischaracterizing both sound money and keynesian money.

Fiat money is extremely hard to use. It doesnt even really exist outside of its home territory. Its not a realistic option unless the government allows it and assists in importing the curerncy, and i dont see cuba doing that.

Bitcoin is the unspoken variable here. 
Bitcoin has no interest rate, it cannot be devalued via printing, and serves as an escape valve of last resort. 
Bitcoin makes negative fiat interest rates extremely risky and ineffective, because people who are stuck between the usual pre-recession rock and a hard place: Low or Negative yield bonds, CDs, and bank accounts vs assets (stocks/real estate) which are poised for a rapid loss of price valuation, now have a third option which is neither of the above. 
Instead of being able to dump the penalty for a decade of malinvestment on those who work and save, the fiat currency itself falls to hyperbitcoinization.

Perfect! if the average business venture is returning &gt; 5% with nearly zero risk, but yours only 4%, then your inferior venture is well below market before even doing a risk analysis. You should definitely not waste your resources and impose dis-economies on the market (such as people who will inevitably lose their jobs after the correction)
Deflation in a sound money environment can only be driven by growth - so if its as high as 5% the economy clearly does not need your inferior project. By saving your money, you contribute to those real innovators by removing your money from the market and thus indirectly investing in their ventures. Hoarding is the second best thing you can do, and it is nicely encouraged.


It is wonderful, and reduces false growth, slows down over-optimistic markets, and prevents market crashes.

It was always the plan to make a new fork/split after bcash killed the main chain. That was how it was sold internally; a way to keep treadmilling the bitcoin community into investing into new chains. A pump-dump cycle that would allow the organizers to essentially print money indefinitely. They had carved up the pie, and expected to rake in billions. 
It failed, and the bcash team was in recover. But craig's faction got tired of waiting for the next payday.  The BABblers knew it was too soon to run another scam, but the BSVers needed to see some returns. They got too greedy and jumped the gun. Until bitmain could deleverage its existing stockpile of bcash, there was no way they could risk it.  So the camps split. BSV predictably failed, because it simply didnt have the support of the parasitic corporations, nor the deep pockets of bitmain.
There is still a concerted effort to recover all or at least some of the market value. Working directly with conbase, gemini, bitpay, and other parasitic organizations they are attempting to shoehorn the BAB off onto the community, while continuing to fund astroturf. They have managed another artificial pump up from 0.03 back to the 0.06 range, but it already shows signs of decay, so yet more capital is trapped in the doomed asset. 
Until bitmain and the parasitic bitcoin companies go bankrupt, we are not out of the woods. But signs do look good for an ultimate death of the bcash scam sideshow.

Extensive growth is a self-regulating problem because the space humans can easily colonize is limited. The increased quantity of production caused by new members of a population is matched by their increased consumption of goods and services.
So even with a fixed monetary base, the necessary increase in velocity by having more buyers and spenders results in a stable equilibrium for price levels. 
There is no "something for nothing" to be had by waiting on your bum for new people to do work. Yes, those new people will flood the market with new products and services, but they will likewise consume products and services as well. 
This leaves your savings with no appreciation other than that caused by intensive growth.

Luckily that L1 limit doesn't matter at all... 




Even if you assume that velocity is fixed or fictional, and thus that extensive growth must drive down prices, deflation in a sound money environment tends to stabilize because money is not being destroyed and there is no deleveraging. Production adjusts to match the spending and prices, causing the very motive for reduced spending to moderate. 
Without intensive growth, there is negligible gain possible. Speculation on extensive growth is futile.


Compared to what? Even if that was the case, its clearly its not as pathological as granting a oligarchy the privilege to print themselves free money. Malinvestment to avoid inflation losses is far more pathological. You at least have to have a reasonable alternative before you call a fair system "pathological".

Dont let the dollar price distact you; nothing has changed. 
When the dollar goes into deflation, like it is now, you will see the bitcoin price fall rapidly. That's because assets like stocks and equities which are pumped up by dollar creation are the first to fall during dollar deflation. 
So until the government starts printing money again or lowers interest rates, btc prices will likely stay depressed. And that is okay; ultimately we are still small and its really more of an exaggerated change in the value of the dollar than a real change in the utility of bitcoin. 
Long term, as the dollar cycles through grows and contraction over and over again, bitcoin will continue to rise over it in value, as the dollar *must* eventually be printed in mass quantities. 
Worst case for bitcoin; the dollar is bound to gold or such, becomes a sound currency with a 100% reserve requirement. If that were to happen, bitcoin and the dollar would reach a stable equilibrium and it would be a fistfight. But I suspect that is impossible; there is no way the fed could retain any meaning if it set a 100% reserve requirement, and it would destroy the governments ability to tax and spend.

But this is not the kind of windfall a responsible person uses for cars and vacations imo. 
I mean its your life, and you only live once though; but please realize it is a small windfall and not a life changing amount. and the IRS will take half of it. 
what youve got if you sell today is half of a modest single family home. Its not the lottery.

you are not wrong; you can stubbornly mine empty blocks, or small blocks with legacy tx's only and no segwit commitment. However that attack is mitigated as more of the minable transaction fees more to segwit.

Even an old laptop is probably better than a new raspbipi..  Your problem may have had more to do with network speed than with the hardware.
If you had trouble getting your node synced up, investigate your networking situation first. You can shortcut the process by downloading a torrent of a blockchain snapshot - that often helps get past several years of old bock data fast.
If you are building a node just for statistics or read only purposes, the cheapest option is just to run a cloud hosted node. 
If I was building a new node from scratch for a hot wallet, I prefer self-hosted. My first choice is always leftover old hardware. If you dont have any, a raspberry pi is a nice choice because of price and electricity consumption. 
While I like the pre-built solutions, I prefer to build &amp; install the software myself.

Sure; attempting the apply tainting rules to coins is bad. but that (1) has nothing to do with bip70 in specific, (2) can be and is done with raw address payments.
Making bip70 mandatory is logic and good. (the spec could be improved imo, but its already far better than raw payments) I dont know of any good alternative that provides what it does. And it has nothing to do with coin taint at all.


I am responding to that. In particular this is false:


Have you never implemented a wallet yourself ? You can easily quarantine any coin with a taint  measurement. There is no way to prevent that other than not shopping with that merchant.  If anything bip70 helps to prevent that: with bip 70 you could sue for damages and actually have proof of what you purchased. Without bip70, you have no recourse, and you cannot prove that the destination you sent coin to even belongs to the merchant.

It doesnt work that way. Mining farms are built in response to the availability of electricity. Someone doesnt open up a mining farm and wait for a power plant to be built.


GPU's are not used for bitcoin mining. And bitcoin miners are invariably colocated with power. Which means conversion of existing electricity to bitcoin usage saves massive amount of transmission loss; because it is not transmitted very far. 
You are also ignoring what the shift of energy comes from. Electricity used for bitcoin is not being used for its old purpose. Whatever use the electricity would have gone to without bitcoin would likely have been worse. What you are failing to see is that bitcoin is a more efficient method of organizing the economy; after the last vestiges of the dollar and fiat currencies are wiped out then the total amount of energy wasted will be vastly reduced.

When the dollar supply contracts the dollar prices of *ALL* assets start to fall, including bitcoin. 
This is known as "deflation", and it means that massive numbers of dollars are being destroyed.
part of it is intentional; the Fed is increasing interest rates which slows down dollar printing. 
Part of it is simply due to debt service; when the economy and spending slows down, people still have to pay their debts. When debts were made, more dollars circulated in the economy. As more debts are paid, fewer dollars exist, and thus the ones left are worth more. 
Most of the excess dollars showed up in equities markets; so most of the loss shows up there, but it will slowly spread out to other things.
Bitcoin is not exempt from that- the dollar price of bitcoin should go down in this case because the dollar is stronger. It will likely be exaggerated in btc, because bitcoin is a small market with lots of weak hands.

Be the change you want to see.
The single most important thing: hodl. Change some of your long term savings to BTC cold storage. If you are earning money, slowly save more btc each month.
Always withdraw from exchanges: not your keys not your coins. Never ever leave a balance on an exchange longer than necessary to withdraw.
Privacy: Try to avoid buying from KYC exchanges. If you have no alternatives, then use something like wasabi wallet to do some tumbles before you stash your savings. 
Everything is derivative from these actions. 
Secondary importance: shop with BTC if it is beneficial to you - for example if there is a discount. But never use bitpay, if you see bitpay back out. This is far less important than hodling.

We are certainly indoctrinated; our public schooling pushes the same leftism and historical revisionism seen in europe. Even in the most solidly conservative areas, the teaching staff are usually low paid leftist intelligensia who are pushing a pro-government anti-freedom message.
Any american who break free of that message is escaping their indoctrination. Perhaps it is easier for americans to do it, because there is a much larger pro-freedom movement here than elsewhere. And the USA hasnt yet achieved the level of police state that europeans have.


I find that is the case for europe. any sort of philosophical variation is allowed so long as it does not cross the socialist core. Its like getting to pick your preferred color style for you handcuffs - you can whatever fashion you want. But in reality, very few europeans come out against self-slavery via government, and they risk jail time for it. So there is no meaningful political discourse in europe.
If the liberty minded people claim all leftists are alike, thats because the differences in pinko philosophies are so small they arent with recognizing.

This is an example of "QE pooling" 
QE is money printing, but it does not cause widespread inflation as the new money leaks out into the economy. 
It gets trapped into sub-markets, or, "liquidity pools". so the price of securities is kept up, but this doesn't turn into a price change for food or commodities directly.  In the USA, the prices for securities, real estate, and equities remain high despite overall consumer prices remaining low. This is a selective inflation; the value of the monetary unit is changing at a non-uniform rate across segments of the market. 
QE cannot go on indefinitely; at some point the government will run out of things to buy as it ends up owning all of everything. 
Also, its entirely possible that the isolated pools spring a leak -' that someone holding a large amount of printed money will spend it in the broader economy on anything - goods, services, or even commodities such as bitcoin. 
As soon as the new money starts circulating out into the broader economy, prices will react and even more liquidity will free up, causing rapid inflation.

I would expect the trezor wallet is just too slow for high speed signatures like liquid would want. Its more optimized for low volume personal individual transactions, and is quite slow at producing signatures. 
For higher value stuff like liquid, i would consider perhaps a dedicated server environment perhaps 


Many shitcoin scammers actually offer bounties for this stuff. So that makes it very cost effective as the cost of development is essentially subsidized. And since nearly noone actually uses shitcoins, there is very low support burden. I think it comes down to cost/return and marketing concerns. 
I think they are wrong overall; so i agree with you. its pretty stupid to pollute their core bitcoin infrastucture with shitcoin flotsam.

Ethereum failed because it was a bad idea top to bottom. 
Its turns out that design is not just taking an alphabet soup of random buzzwords and mish-mashing them together.  
The one and only goal of eth was the print a bunch of money and award it to the developers of the project, and in that sense it was very successful. A few others made smaller money on the scam, but most people lost big. 
And it has no long game, no light at the end of the tunnel, no ray of hope for a turn-around; become long term fundamentals come into play and eth has none. Its an empty bubble of pure hype and shite code.

Be specific; what blockchain solves is transaction re-ordering. Thats not "hacking" per se. Its a probem for ledger systems. 
PoW is the only known solution to that problem, but it requires are strong majority participation to work. 
So by definition, it only works for one global blockchain at a time. 
so if you want decentralized protection from re-ordering for a ledger system, you have to build on top of bitcoin. There is no other choice.

This is false; it requires multiple simultaneous mining of different sub-optimal blocks and an empty block. Normal mining only works towards the optimal block. ASIC boost is not just about fairness: its strictly a bug which rewards sub-optimal behavior.


If the market as a whole sees it as a benefit; it can be done. Like UASF; the hard to quantify economic majority may be able to act to cause it to happen. However, if enough key players decide to perform the switch, a flag day announced sufficiently far in advance can make it a reality.


I see no reason why a bugfix should allow opting out.  Soft forks are perfect and optimal for this type of change.

The article mentions joinmarket, and while it was good a few years ago, its fairly unable to provide security today. 
The problem with their yield generator side is obvious- its about making money and not privacy so the tradeoff are wrong.  Arguably thats okay, because you are primarily trying to earn and not tumble there.
The client side has some crucial flaws as well. When you enter into a tumbling pass as a client, the startup and tear down phases are very recognizable. The way the wallet layers coins is recognizable. The way the joins are performed is very easy to analyze, and you can link change over the pass to effectively untumble the process. Joinmarket passes often miz different levels of segwit, and that is a dead giveaway. And nearly all users move their coins after joinmarket in a way that is very easy to recognize.
So if you use joinmarket, unless you are very adept it is nearly impossible to get any security improvements. The fact that it is not a daily use wallet combined with a tumbler is a big limitation. 
The right time to tumble your coins is *always*. You wallets should never be out of joinmode.

Ive done coinjoin sudoku at a hobby level - I guarantee you it is not only done, but I would be surprised if many joinmarket transactions have been able to survive analysis. There are no shortage of professionals in this space, and nearly every wallet leave fingerprints. I guarantee you the stonewall in samourai isnt fooling anyone. 
One main design problem is the limit of one change output. Another is the fact that change output is also not equal sized, or made a polynomial of the root join amount. Another weakness is that input size polynomials are not considered in the joining process. 
I do think the Wasabi join protocol is better, and improves many of these problems. I think the fact that there is not a public opensource join coordinator p2p network is a major problem there. At least joinmarket lets you shop around. It also lacks a market incentive for anyone other than the coordinator.
I wouldnt mine to work on an opensource zerolink p2p coordination network, and possibly even an enhanced zerolink protocol. To be meaningful, the project would need to include at least one wallet, and would need to do as much spends via joins as possible, and to isolate tracers and other attacks. To facilitate that happening in a reasonable time, there would have to be a market incentive not just for the coordinator, but also for makers.
In short; taking the best of joinmarket and the best of wasabi and coming up with a join network designed for real time activity.

So it is strictly better.
Case (1) you do not get credit for the purchase, and bitpay has your money which they may or may not ever refund. You have no proof the address even belong to bitpay. You have zero legal recourse, and they can freely rob you now.
Case (2) Bitpay tells you they are not going to accept the transaction. You still have your coins and are not out anything. You can still post the transaction to the blockchain directly if you want to get back into case1, but you will be able to prove what you were buying and that the address belongs to bitpay (if you wanted to sue, for example). Alternatively you could join/tumble/anon your coins and remove the taint and repeat the same purchase.
Case 2 is strictly better in everyway. You get more information and more proof in any alternative, and you get more choices to boot. BIP70 is excellent. You are also less vulnerable to hacks and scams at every step.
Plus, with tumblebit, confidential transactions, and various other enhancements coming down the pike, tracking coins and blockchain forensics is going to die out. Bitcoin is and always will be fungible.

50 doesnt mean they have 50 doors to knock on; it just means they have 50 leads that could all be dead-ends. 
Of course, if you go an use one of the 50 to buy something from amazon to your home address, then sure, thats a door they can knock on, and it might be the only one of the 50.
The issue with deanonymyzation is whenever you tie a bitcoin address to a real world identity. 
For most people, that means when you buy BTC from an AML KYC exchange. 
But that is not all - anytime you make a purchase with BTC you are also tying it to a real world identity - forever. 
This is also the weak point of most tumbling implementations, since a single spend could reset your wallet to 0.  Spending of any kind should also be done as part of a join, ideally, however that often conflicts with the short time limits on sales many merchants have. 
A continuously tumbled pool, which does fake-o tricks like stonewall to help bridge spends, might be a good enough compromise to keep bitcoin clean.

Agreed, it does help... especially against causal forensics. Anyone who is not tracking funds movement in real time simply misses out on information which there is no way to recover. Unlike L1, where the blockchain is forever, LN channels are ephemeral and individual transactions are forgotten after settlement.
But unless it happens over Tor like networks and gets a *lot* more volume, I dont think LN adds very much to privacy right now. Someone who invests heavily in highly linked low fee sybil nodes might be able to build a decent picture of overall funds flows. And unless all major governments and spy agencies go away, its safest to assume someone is doing their best to keep a full record of everything that happens on LN.
So there is still a need for some tumbling to ensure a LN trade is anonymous, because LN cannot provide any such guarantee in the same way.
It would be interesting to see something like the wasabi/zerolink protocol used over LN contracts, in which a LN channel spend can be used to fund a completely uncorrelated participation into a join, into which the LN provider has no idea what outputs he is funding, and the join pool sees an input which is completely uncorrelated with the actual join participant, and any change does not even belong to the joining party. 
But even then, zerolink is providing most of the guaranteed security, and the LN link only provides a "maybe" level of security, which comes with a bunch of assumptions about how the routing went down.

i hate bitpay as much as the next person, but I dont see the evil in bip70.
People can always ignore your transactions if they choose to. Simply displaying an address is *not enough* for a proper payment transaction, and more really is needed.
Making sure you are not getting MitM's is a start; your wallet can check that the displayed receipt matches the real website, and no phisher, or virus or address swapper is trying to steal your funds. Next it actually establishes PROOF for you the customer that you paid for a given order. Without this, you just fired off bitcoin into the unknown and have to hope they honor the agreement.  
Lastly, with simple raw addresses, there is no way to safely establish a refund/return mechanism. When your original purchase set the rules for returns then you can be sure you are refunding the right person in the right place. 
Bitpay is evil and stupid, but I dont see any good alternatives for bip70 out there.

Im rejecting the transaction by not accepting it. I cannot control your ballistic send of coins andymore than I can stop people from sending dust tracers to past addresses. but my wallet can note that the coin you sent me is "bad" and I can not credit you for the purchase quite easily. And if it is a raw bitcoin send, you have no receipt, of proof of purchase, nor even any way to prove the destination you sent to even belongs to me. 
So yes, I have rejected the transaction, and you are out your money.
Now: In case you are finally getting it: bip70 cannot prevent you from ballistically sending money to addresses you got from me. Unlike raw transactions which require you to blindly send, in bip70 you at least get some indication of whether I would accept it, and even a proof that the address belongs to me and what you are sending the money for the purpose of. I cannot stop you from posting the transaction straight to the blockchain; but at least you have control.

Without that deception it is unlikely to attract enough market value to sustain any level of mining; thus it is most likely that the chain will freeze permanently and stop issuing blocks.

That doesnt change the fact that it is socialism's natural enemy. Only good ideas and voluntary systems can cooexist with a bitcoin economy, and socialism is neither. Bitcoin may come sooner than you expect. 


You underestimate how many people will choose not to participate in that system when they have control, when their money cannot easily be monitored and taken from them. Its easy to say you like the system when you have no real choice or control.
Socialists are idiots who are stealing and wasting other people's money and pretending it is somehow noble when it is the exact opposite. But almost none of them are so foolish as to pay in to the government run ponzi scheme when they know that others have the freedom to opt-out.

Its quite the opposite. a sense of responsibility and safety and a joy for life. When someone is angry or yelling at you, its easy to be the one to deescalate even if you are not in the wrong. When someone says nasty insults, or tries to provoke you, you are not bothered and you can walk away without feeling any loss of pride. And of course, you are never the person to start a fight, to get angry, or to provoke others.

I get what they want to achieve: any construction, no matter how limited or useless, that they can claim "quantum supremacy" from.
Yes, the universe appears to have quantum states, and yes parts of reality are hard to simulate with a Turing machine. 
That still doesn't mean that anything useful will come from quantum computing, even if a relatively impractical and constrainted form of "supremacy is found, (and for which pseudo random number generators are quite good enough for any practical problem) 
This form of "technically correct" that they are chasing will certainly do wonders for their funding situation, and will lead to government and private donors continuing to sponsor quantum computing for decades.  that is of course the real goal.
This is so far away from bitcoin and cryptography that there really is no need to even discuss it here. It does not prove that practical quantum cryptanalysis will ever happen.

Its not even monetary inflation imo. 100% of bitcoins monetary inflation happened at the genesis block when ~21M bitcoin were defined to exist. 
Since the amount is precise, permanent, and unalterable, its not accurate to call the block reward new issuance. A block the same as any other transaction that moves value. If you pay XYZ for binance to send you XZY bitcoin, then you also pay XYZ hashes for the block reward to send you XZY bitcoin. The block reward is paid out by a virtual exchange who has a very well known balance to sell.
You could say 'Eth' has inflation, because that shitcoin has a truly open and unpredictable outlay ahead of it.

It worked for gold just fine.
Steep unbacked short selling helps to break up momentum, and keep sentiment low. You mitigate the risk by selling in dollars, which you can print in unlimited quantities. This is only the first half of the equation.
the second step is to fractionally reserve the asset.  "paper gold" is anytime gold is bought and settled without real physical delivery. Gold is particularly vulnerable to this because it is so expensive to deliver physically. Bitcoin is much more practical to deliver.
That said; its not going to stop them from trying. With the futures market to prevent break away price appreciation, and cooperation from exchanges to sell "fake" btc to customers who dont seem likely to withdraw, the total market for btc can be kept small.

ignoring numismatic value; no.
Silver simply hasnt held value well. If you look at a hundred year chart of dollar value vs silver value; just to hold even at 1:1 silver should be $600 an ounce just to stay at water level. But silver has fallen just about as fast as the dollar.
There are many reason; the decline in the consideration of silver as money. Improvements in technology for mining and recycling. The growth in "paper silver" investments and etfs which pulls its price down to manufacturing value. And the general storage/trade difficulties.
although it is a very short trend, and the future is unpredictable, the ability of bitcoin to hold value is unprecedented; neither gold nor silver have been able to match its staying power vs inflation.

One way to read this prediction is that bitcoin might not break 20K again until 2024. IOW its very broad in its claims, so it will take a long time to be proven false.
As with all predictions and TA however, this one makes the same assumptions that the past price data can be used to predict future price. 
I dont find that likely because the market environment for bitcoin is changing in fundamental ways compared to previous years. Every economic actor, ever service built on top of Bitcoin, and every imposition of law or burdensome regulations changes the flow of trade.
Many once-great companies like bitpay have become festering cespits. Many growing markets have become grey or black markets (vietnam, thailand) And markets where bitcoin coin in theory do the most good (venezuela, cuba) and places where it is forbidden/oppressed by government or simple lack of infrastructure.
These are all moderating factors which stand opposed to the positive factors of ever growing longevity and awareness. Its not clear how they will impact bitcoin's s-curve, and whether or not they can prevent bitcoin from entering the steep phase of its growth curve or not.
While it seems obvious that bitcoin will continue to rise, and eventually overcome all the roadblocks and attacks, what is not clear is how long it will take or what path it will follow. Past price history is not a good source of hints, imo, because the conditions were simply too different.

That should not be surprising; if some lender wanted to invest in bitcoin they dont need your involvement. Its generally fairly difficult to get a large loan without the lender having a tight fist over how you use the money.  If it was easy to get Fiat credit to buy bitcoin, then btc would moon instantly while fiat would pop like a balloon.
It is still possible to do what you are trying to do: So long as you are displacing some other cost or expense with newly minted credit money, you can find a way to free up your existing funds or flows for bitcoin purchasing.
if you own or some property or asset, you can mortgage it.  (this can be nearly anything; a house, a car sometimes, a stock portfolio or retirement account) A HELOC might be usable, depending on the terms and conditions. A steady income is crucial here; as failure to make payments could cost your assets.
If you own a business, generic lines of credit could be used. This could be quite challenging for tax purposes, depending on the structure of your business. You might also be able to accept bitcoin as payment, depending on who your customers are and if they are willing to pay with BTC.
The ideal situation would be a personal loan with no collateral held, and a decent interest rate. Much like financing a vacation or other luxury spending, these can be difficult to obtain or carry punitive interest rates. If you have a steady and stable income, it may be possible however.

It actually used to matter: Older coins and larger coins were given a higher priority, and could get by with lower fees for the same TX size.

Why? Consumption largely follows production. One person's reduced consumption is an opportunity for others to consume more or to invest. Productivity has gone up since the beginning of time, and that has not been hampered by a lack of consumption. 
The truth is that consumption is infinite, and will adapt to whatever level of production exists. The only time a given producer halts is when he is at a competitive disadvantage vs a better producer.

Only because of legal tender laws, which prevent a fair market valuation. 
People are forced to accept the lower quality fiat at face value vs gold/silver notes etc. (the original dollar) 
So If you were owed 1 golden dollar, and someone gave you a lower value fiat dollar instead, you would have no legal recourse. 
That said, bitcoin doesnt play this game. There are no "bitcoin dollars" or such, since it doesnt need reservation. so cash vs bitcoin is always fairly priced vs the market; which may be all it takes to break the dollar.
At some point the government will try to find a way to fix the leak; perhaps with some new targeted legislation. But the old methods will not work.

I'll take that bet happily; you hold as much of your national fiat as you can, while I will hold as much bitcoin as I can. You will be investing in an inflationary  centrally planned currency, taxation, social services, gun control, socialism, and basically everything bitcoin opposes. I'll be on the other side. Good luck. See you in ten years. Tell me which national fiat you are investing in. I'll be in as many satoshis as I can earn. Your stash will be backed up by the full faith and credit of the most corrupt and self serving people in your country, while mine will be backed up by as many guns and friends with guns I can put together.

National fiat - too centralized, a free market for competing private currencies would allow a superior currency to emerge.
Fractional reserve banking causes economic downturns. It would be better to remove support for fractional reserve banking, and thus allow it to die naturally. 
All laws regarding money transmission/ money laundering / BSA / AML/ KYC must be abolished. 
But most importantly of all; the Fed of course must be abolished.

They pay fees if they actually get used. And only the part that gets used has to pay, because thats all that goes in the blockchain.
So you have can a n/m script with 2/1 billion possible co-signers, but never need to show more than 2, and never need to waste blockchain space with the other 999,999,998 unused cosigners.
so it will save space, and allow super large scripts so long as they pay a fair fee what what they actually use. IMO, its rather brilliant.

Technology improves, and productivity improves. Every year we get better at what we do.


It can require fewer employees who earn more individually, and overall cost less but do more. this is the trend.
This has always been the trend; it may have been exceedingly slow in the medieval, but it happens within a lifetime in the present.


Because the economy and technology are not static but improve and increase. 
The excess labor freed up find new products and services to provide. That is progress.
There will come a day where you may do the majority of your earning in the first 5-10 years of your career, then live off your savings for the rest. Things may move so fast that you would need retraining to be productive after that.
For this to be a reality, inflation needs to stop.

Being able to impose an asymmetric burden. Spammers, having no real need to make transactions, were the smartest people in the ecosystem, and could spend a small amount of money to cause others to spend a large amount.
It was possible to thus "spam" the bitcoin network in the past because the ecosystem was weak. Fee predictors were very aggressive, and would turn a small traffic jam in to a long and sustained one.
Many economic participants were paying a huge fee multiple because they were essentially designed to ignore the whole confirmation process and just wanted to treat L1 like a payment network. So they would set fees brutally high, which of course sets the bar for everyone else, who reacts by then raising another huge jump.
Many actors were treating all transactions as equal priority, even when there are plenty that do not need priority particularly. Someone just trying to consolidate their wallet with no plans to spend didnt need a fixed 10K or 100K satoshi fee as usd to be common practice in nearly all wallets.
Many online service and wallets now let you select a priority level and advertise the cost, rather than assuming you want "deadly emergency at any price" treatment. They also commonly aggregate or batch lower priority transactions, because that is more efficient. (tons of needless change outputs are eliminated, and the overall size and overhead reduced)
Most importantly, people have written much smarter fee estimators, which can aggressively seek a low fee, and dont have to choose a super high confidence interval because they can adjust the fee upwards with RBF later.  This means you can target a 50% confidence of confirmation within your desired timeline, and bump the fee up if it dips below a low water mark. So by choosing a lower fee, you signal to others that a lower fee is going to work, and they reciprocate by also choosing a lower fee, and thus the market functions without the needed arms race. 
CPFP is also used in a similar way; when a counterparty sends you funds which are not arriving, you can selectively speed them up. With this tool, you have recourse other than complaining about their low fee setting. 
To spam the bitcoin network today, you actually have to pay for it at a fair market rate; IOW, it would no longer be spam but a legitimate purchase of space.
To visualize this, imagine this metaphor: 
* The old bitcoin highway used to be full of nearly-blind road raging single-passenger ambulances who would constantly swerve between lanes and didnt care who or what their passenger was, and whether or not they were even in a rush. All lanes were fast lanes.
* Judas Ver used to sit on the overpass giggling and throwing rocks at the ambulances, to cause traffic jams.
* The new bitcoin highway has buses with many passengers, freight trucks, limos, and polite cab drivers. It has fast and slow lanes, and a smooth way to change lanes from slow to fast if needed. Ambulances are rare, and other drives just let them pass, without trying to become ambulances themselves.
* Judas pebble are ignored, and to cause a traffic jam now, he would have to buy and deploy a real fleet of cars.

In short; a small group of the largest banks can create and destroy US dollars at will.

You have to be daft to think bitcoin is less fungible than cash. Very small amounts of cash, in tiny $20 denominations are widely accepted in the USA only, but each bit of cash has a unique serial number, an unchangeable denomination,  and a  physical manifestation which has to be lugged around. 
Large amounts of cash are near completely non-negotiable, triggering confiscation or account freezes automatically.
Cash is the least fungible form of dollars around, and very trackable/traceable in any non-trivial amount.
Bitcoin can be moved all around the world with zero effort and can be converted into new forms with no relation to old forms without much effort at all. It can also be completely removed from the physical world and brought back later

The main value of an insider in the binance hack would have been to gain intelligence on the design of the system, and learn details about what secret traps and limits were in place. It would have ruined their plans if there was a hot wallet freeze that they accidentally tripped. 
I have little doubt that an insider at the very least helped to coordinate the theft, but probably did not operationally participate for obvious reasons. 
The big question is about how they were able to gain 2fa credentials. Its possible they simply reset or added 2fa to the users. Its possible they were able to intercept or redirect SMS messages. Maybe they even got the shared secrets from OTP.  Somehow they were able to gain full control of user accounts, and that is really the interesting part of this whole picture.

Gold itself has elastic supply; so if it was all the world money, there would be incredible advances in gold mining, space mining, etc. Plus, the current governments could not survive on a gold standard even if the wanted to; and even if they somehow could, a gold standard is still inferior to a cryptographic one.

Dollars are always being created and destroyed; and they dont flow smoothly or equally to all markets. In particular, lots of dollars were created for stocks and real estate, and those markets will be the ones to feel dollar destruction the most acutely.
The dollar is still overall inflating. If you looks at the prices of everyday things you will see they are continuing the usual and customary slow creep upwards. This is necessary; even a tiny bit of deflation would rapidly decimate the entire dollar ecosystem; that is its inherent nature. 
When you look at bitcoin, yes there is still some new minting going on via block rewards. The question is really how well does the market anticipate it. In a perfect information market, everyone would know exactly how much bitcoin remains to be created, and would thus price it in.  I suspect that is not the reality, since peoples understanding and models of the flow of BTC are not perfect; so most likely some amount of block reward does represent real inflation.  That said, its probably nothing compared to dollar inflation. Bitcoin is already strongly deflationary compared to the dollar, even despite the bear market trend.
We are approaching a crossroads where the Fed will need to decide how to act. The interest rate ramp up has caused asset markets to stumble; if they do not show signs of strength the fed may need to lower rates or possibly return to a new QE regime.
In summary; the best outcome for the Fed is if somehow we all gain so much productivity that we can overcome the market debt bubble it owes to itself, and keep the dollar machine running for another decade.

You would only write it down if you memory cannot handle a passphrase, or you need it to be readable by people other than yourself.
And the minimum size secure passphrase is a 12 word mnemonic, which if you cannot memorize that then there is no secure method that can store your key.

Thats such a strange sentiment to me. What is your basis for believing in alts?
Did you read the whitepaper, and understand all the math? Did you review the source code? Did you chat with their lead devs in the mailing lists, and check their backgrounds? Did you find out who the investors were, and what their goal and reputations are ? 
I have, and I have to tell you there are zero viable alts. None have the creds of the bitcoin team, the quality of pace of development, or the level of technology. Bitcoin is the only show in town. 
ICO's and altcoins are just "me too" projects hoping to catch suckers and blind investors. They want to capitalize on the hype, so they can end up with more bitcoin in the end. They market hard and constantly, have paid posters, pay people for fake adoption (did you see the babcash 1.25mm from judas?) 
I wont hold back if there is a viable alt that seems like real competition. But the truth is there is nothing even close. Buying into alts is feckless, and its going to burn you.

You cannot always tell what is change, so thats already a wild guess.
And it is accounting for batching in the sense that it is going to show a high number of "payments" if the average number of payment goes up due to more outputs per tx.
and if the change guesser was anything close to accurate, you would have already been discarding change outpus pre-batching.
Which means, assuming the change guesser is good, the chart is accounting for batching just fine, and its not showing an artificially lower line just because more is done in fewer txs.

Most of the complexity is bullshit. Economics is a field mostly filled with smoke and mirrors, because the ground truths are so simple they cannot be used for pretext.  "Laissez-faire" has been well known since the 6th century BC and hasnt been improved upon. Sure, we now have game theory and better understanding of why things are, but all of these things point back to free markets without government being the best possible solution to all things economic. 
So why add in all the smoke and mirrors, and fancy terminology? They ever changing tunes of keynsians and mmt? Its all a cover story for why the rulers should be able to steal from the people, and nothing more.
Markets are not anthropomorphic giants who catch colds and need caretakers. Markets are just people, and the various instruments of monetary policy and fiscal policy are just parasites on the people. None of them are necessary, none of them are positive, and all of them are simply overhead stolen from our present and future to subsidize the political class in their indolent luxury.

Economic whataboutism. 
Things should be getting cheaper, and salaries should be getting higher *both*. People are more productive, and products are getting easier to manufacture. 
The fact that the numbers have shifted upwards is bad. Raises arent automatic. Savings still get depleted by inflation, forcing you over to the stock market. People who get freshly printed dollars extract wealth from those last in line.
Without economic intervention and mass scale theft by the Fed, prices should be slowly falling as salaries creep upwards.

Usually much much more. With just 3 its actually unlikely to be a batched transaction. 


not always


Identifying which output is change is non-trivial. The only foolproof way is for each user to tell you. some wallets dont do a very good job of obscuring it, and with strong forensics you can impugn it sometimes. But I highly data you are using premium forensics for this chart.
Anyway, like I said, assuming your change guess was an is good, you are in fact handling batch transactions correctly, assuming no other bugs exist.

I expect it could still be done with a very good broadband connection, and a good computer 100% dedicated to the task. It seems common for the process to fail and hang, but if you are lucky it gets done within weeks or a month or so.

Bitcoin needs a flea collar.
Its funny how there are almost always smaller signs for alts tacked on to any "We accept Bitcoin" sign. Its like fleas or other parasites that attach themselves to bigger animals. Yet you rarely see the symbiotic ones, like "Lighting" or "Tumblebit" or "ZeroLink" etc, the ones that would be actually welcome.
We need to shake off the scammers and parasite coins, who really just want to print money and pay it to themselves, and instead focus on value additions to the main bitcoin core protocol.
Being able to take payments over Lightning network has great speed benefits and super low cost. While paying over a chaumian coinjoin over tor costs a bit more, but is the best security possible in the cryptocurrency space (not government owned honeypots like monero)

The "taint" lives in someone else's mind or opinion. The coin's satoshi value and exact digital state is completely unaffected. 
Unless you go about putting your personal identity into websites and allowing them to track you, taint has no meaning at all.

I recommend making them a normal paper wallet then: write out the 12 bip39 words for a standard compliant wallet, and they can restore it when they want.
Plenty of wallets are bip84 compatible now, and they should have no trouble being used for paper wallet purposes.
You can make it just like normal bitcoin cash paper by including the public key in a QR code on the front, then hiding the recovery words on the back or behind a fold.

If there was no risk, there would be no upside. They go hand in hand. 
If someone could guarantee the future of bitcoin, it would moon now. 
Personally, I think bitcoin is massively undervalued, and has no real competition.

Giving Judas grounds to sue you is not smart business. He is a professional scammer, I'm sure he knows how to get a tight contract written. 
the problem is that your name is mud for taking bcash so its not worth that amount of money to be just another shitcoin startup.

Thats easy: bitcoin 100%, shitcoins n/a %
so far, no alt has proven to have any real value at all. Using a fakable metric like market cap is just silliness. There is a real market for one cryptocurrency, and alts shoudlnt even be in the same category. 
I dont care if there is a wacky market cap site for alts; jsut dont mix bitcoin in with that nonsense.

I see the big banks as dinosaurs which barely recognize bitcoin's existence.
The bad guys are the shitcoiners.

yes, it must be. Not one single socialist policy can be enacted without a strong centralized government. Its simply impossible to enact socialism without it. Without strong central government, there is no way to prevent capitalism from happening.


They had socialist policies, and socialist programs, had a strong central government, expropriated property, regulated heavily, called themselves socialists, and were socialist in every way. Thinking they were not socialist is insane. All socialists are nazis at the core, with minor variations at most.

I dont care who is in charge of the fan club, nor do i care about sucking in "investors".  There is a natrual market for one crypto currency, and mockery of all second place coins is natural. I dont particularly care which coin happens to be first place. Its completely apolitical.

You can, if thats what you were actually doing. This thread is not that. You werent responding to a technology comment, but a market sentiment comment, and you latched on to my deprecation of shitcoins.

It cant be capitalism is government is involved, this is pretty simple.
Corporations are a result of goverment interfering the economy. If you look at history, socialists have always used big corporations to achieve their ends. The national socialists used Volkswagen. Krupp, IBM, and other large corporations as instruments of state.
Mega-coporation = socialism. Visa is Socialism.
