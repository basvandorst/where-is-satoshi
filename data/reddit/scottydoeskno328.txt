Fucking miners. There only good for dumping the price. Bitcoin should fork off ASICS. Bring the mining ecosystem back to the people, back to GPUs. Won’t help with the dumping be at least we control our fate instead of these shady ASIC manufacturers.

Wtf did I just watch.

60% of the time it works every time.

"Keep $1.8 miilion in a high yield savings account."
Lol, that's not what you do with $1.8 million.

I don't get why people are so paranoid about this. What can anyone possibly do with that information. Try and hack my Reddit account for my password and then access my email. If you're smart your crypto is in cold storage so they won't be able to get at it regardless.
@_date: 2019-10-01 03:15:59
Huh, so this is how you make money mining crypto. Arson mixed with insurance fraud.
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:07:19
She's an idiot and the plan is idiotic.
@_date: 2019-02-11 05:47:01
Who? Mcafee? Anybody with a brain isn't saying such nonsense. $200k? Ya maybe in 10 years. 
@_date: 2019-06-01 17:27:37
If your going to use android. I like coinomi also Ethos has a nice interface. I wouldn't keep your hodl Bitcoin on a phone though. Get a Trezor or Nano or a dedicated computer that you only use for crypto.
@_date: 2019-02-27 08:16:59
Is this vulnerability in the mobile wallet as well or just desktop?
@_date: 2019-02-09 01:18:19
Ya that's still way to early to be 100% confident here. This looks perfectly like a dead cat.

Who says the "bubble" is over. What makes you think this bear market is over because it isn't yet. 
@_date: 2019-10-01 03:17:39
It has literally no effect on price of Bitcoin. Only positive could be this mining operation can’t dump their Bitcoin for electric bills now.
@_date: 2019-10-01 12:33:45
You don’t think their shit is insured?
@_date: 2019-02-10 23:48:57
$200k. Let's get back to ATHs first guy. Then shoot for $50k
@_date: 2019-02-10 16:26:25
If you try and trade Bitcoin you're going to be destroyed. It's idiotic. Just dollar cost average in. You will not make money trading. No one makes money trading and the guys selling trading courses don't make money trading themselves, otherwise they would just trade and not need to sell courses to make money. It's simple logic. Why are they selling courses because they don't make money trading. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 05:50:15
Attacked? Okay snowflake. Let's move you over to the safe space Reddit. There, that's attacking you. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 16:17:07
Mining cost means absolutely dick. Why don't people get this. Price dictates mining. Mining does not control price.
@_date: 2019-06-01 20:08:55
No I was referring to people that admittedly say to censor how much Bitcoin you have. I mean, yes you shouldn't disclose your wealth usually ever but if you mention you have over 10 Bitcoin or whatever who cares. As long as you take the proper precautions.
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:52:28
Literally the best advice is what you don't want to hear. Do not trade. If trading was easy everyone would be rich.
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:57:42
He's correct at that assumption because the price of Bitcoin fluctuates. Govt can't have you claiming losses on $19,000 Bitcoin when today it's worth only $4,000. So they say you can only claim loss at what you bought it for. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 16:20:08
So you purchased speculative shit coins with zero hope in trying to make money off them....oooook guy. 
@_date: 2019-06-01 17:24:55
If your talking about investing $5 a week. Then what does it matter if Bitcoin dips $1-2k. The difference is insignificant. If you want to invest a little every week. That's great as your averaging into Bitcoin, instead of trying to time the market and missing opportunities.
@_date: 2019-04-20 12:42:38
Everyone knows you never go full retard.
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:21:31
Here's your answer. Nobody will know until after it already happened. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:23:00
In Bitcoin? Nothing. In USD? A fuck ton. I've been hodling since September of 2017.

I literally LOL'd at this comment. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:20:14
Yes let's ponder stuff that we won't have to worry about in our lifetimes. Meanwhile Bitcoin is crashing and the world as we know it is coming to an end. 
@_date: 2019-05-04 23:43:05
If you have 1 Bitcoin you ain't rich. Even if your one Bitcoin goes to $250,000. You still ain't "rich". 
No one can reasonably retire on one $250k Bitcoin. 
Now if you can reach the 2.1 million club, that's another story.
@_date: 2019-05-21 12:24:53
No. They don't actually accept Bitcoin. An App just converts it. You can't actually go into these places and pull out your regular Bitcoin wallet on your phone and pay in real Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-24 01:23:03
That's one way to piss off everyone around you lol. 
@_date: 2019-05-01 07:14:57
How the fuck do you correlate arrogance of Bitcoin maximalists to Nazis and white supremacists. Now you just sound stupid.
@_date: 2019-05-21 12:35:10
They cutoff the pizza guy to fit their narrative and make him look stupid, that really annoyed me. After they asked him about today's prices of the 10,000 BTC it looked like he was about to say something. But instead they just cut him off saying thinking like that is not healthy for me. There was most definitely a "but" coming after that sentence. Something like but it was a necessary thing to do, to see if Bitcoin could actually be used and spent in the real world and I would do it again in a heartbeat.
@_date: 2018-12-09 01:26:50
I was reading your past comments thieflar. And I must say it really is incredible what you have written in the past. I would greatly appreciate your insight and opinion on where you believe Bitcoin is heading towards. When do you believe we will make ATH's again. Will we have to wait for the next halvening or do you foresee it coming sooner?
@_date: 2018-12-22 18:22:48
This is hilarious. I wish I could show this to someone but I'm the only "Bitcoin guy" in my circle of friends and family lol. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 04:27:44
Million subs. What bear market?
@_date: 2019-05-01 23:02:36
....You sound like a liberal nut. Spewing "white supremacists" "Nazis"and now "not offended by your comment".
@_date: 2018-12-09 03:12:31
Wow again really an amazing take on the possible variables. A lot of which you said I never even thought about. I follow a whole slew of crypto youtubers and no one even mentions half the things you pointed out. I love that you're a straight shooter and no fluff sort of person. I really appreciate you taking the time in writing this out. If I can just poke your brain a bit more please lol. Where do you see Bitcoin and crypto going? Do you see this actually being a revolution, an Internet 2.0 sort of deal? Do you believe this could be a world wide currency or are you more in line with this being a store of value, like gold, sort of play?

Would rather dip down to $5k and then shoot past $9k for the last time ever. So we can get one more final Vegeta meme.
