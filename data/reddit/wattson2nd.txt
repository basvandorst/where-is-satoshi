Then do I maintain bitcoin style ownership (control of private keys) or do I maintain court enforced property rights?
The former is just storage and not a credit creator and therefore not a bank and not very useful to me.  The latter seems little improvement over today's system.
What am I missing?

Really?  Why not? It would seem that the problems with fractional reserve arise from "banks" becoming derivative casinos with unlimited entropy creation due to direct access to the BIS lenders of last resort.  
Fractional reserve just makes use of the same facts that go into that we dont all use the hospital (or roads or internet, or airports, or base money...) all at the same time, yes?  In today's universe the fractional reserve system acts to compound the perversions of fiat, and derivative "wealth".  
But in the First Bitcoin Liberty Bank of Panama, that is transparent and passes muster by external DROs....  I wonder what deposit interest rate bitcoin depositors might assent to in the context of an openly auditable institution, with minute over minute transparency, and say 1:5 fractional reserve held in parts in say equal parts bitcoin and bullion.  Why not create credit, bitcoin-credits?  That can be spent in the community, even printed notes! 
This of course assumes an environment of non-suppressed interest rates, widespread commercial acceptance of bitcoin and widespread acceptance of bitcoin-credits.  So maybe by July or so...
I have lurked reddit for at least a year and only felt prompted to write this! Maybe if I liked my ex-wife's cat, I would have more to contribute.
