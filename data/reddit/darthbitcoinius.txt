Instability makes a lot of big players withdrawal substantial amounts, and it settles in between 1500-2000 before climbing back up fairly quickly.

Floor is $2200-$2300 right now. If it hits $2300, I suggest buying hard for the short-term.
For the long-term, fuck if I know with all of the bullshit* being slung around at the moment.

Below the headline:
"The attacks were 'denial-of-service' in nature and did not affect clients' funds."

As a prescriptivist, I feel compelled to repeat myself. That is not what that word means.
Also, it makes you sound like a sorority pledge.

Not so much in bad taste as lazily photoshopped and horribly jpeg'd.

No house. Just an apartment, some clothes, and my bones. And this laptop. And a watch. Not a great watch. It's a Skagen.

Me neither. Come to think of it, I haven't seen anyone use any kind of currency on the internet. It's like they're all using it privately, without my knowledge or something.

*looks at bitcoin price from a few years ago*
hey its me ur brother

But some significant percentage of those who cashed out must have then re-invested a substantial amount back into bitcoin, considering how much it had returned to them already.
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:25:12
Most of the world heard about bitcoin years ago, and most of the world still did not even put a dollar into it.
There is certainly no need to feel regret for some mistake you made in the past involving bitcoin. Why would you have randomly thrown real money at a pipe dream? Unless you had real technical expertise, bitcoin was merely a confusing new technology that was a gimmick until it started exponentially increasing in value. 
There's still uncertainty surrounding it, obviously, but if you can spare a few hundred dollars, there are certainly worse ways to spend that money at the moment than dumping it into bitcoin and hoping that the ride continues. Invest what you can, forget your regret, enjoy the ride.

Wow, and he deleted everything immediately. What a joke.

It's not like I wanted to be the guy to point it out. Also you need another comma before like. I'm sorry.

$24 for a generic brand t-shirt with text on the front. How did this get 130 upvotes...

Floor is $2200-$2300 in the short-term.
Long-term, I like turtles.

Well, cuz...shit...
@_date: 2017-06-22 01:38:10
I know. It's just pure pandering for a quick buck. Take a subreddit joke, add some quick 'n shitty Photoshop work, and boom, 100 people willing to buy a $5 t-shirt for $24. Magic.

Roughly how many DMs did you get asking for free bitcoin after posting this?
@_date: 2017-06-20 02:14:21
But seriously, where are the people who randomly held onto bitcoins from the early days? They became millionaires in 5 years. There must be, like, a hundred of those guys (girls?). I'm legitimately curious to hear how they feel now, at what point they cashed out, and whether they still have a substantial investment in btc.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:28:32
99% of crypto market analysts must be new to the game, then.
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:39:17
Yeah, like the IRS would be desperate enough to ask an employee to use Reddit to gauge how much people are hiding in bitcoin on a Monday night after they told him that this extra work could secure him a promotion in the future. Like that would happen.
