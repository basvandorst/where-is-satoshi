You're probably reading a bit more into that than intended (at min. your distorted understanding removes context provided from other scripture and also expands that particular verse beyond its intended scope) and also you've isolated that one verse from everything else in scripture. How does that interact with Prov 31? Or the command for husbands to submit to wives? Or Christians to submit to one another? Or for husbands to go so far as to sacrifice themselves for their wives as to such a degree as to be complete denial of one's own interest/position for the other? Or the idea of "equalness" before God? Or knowing Wisdom as "she"?
There *is* more to the gender story...your personal hangups not withstanding.
In any case, my daughters are being raised in a far more capable manner than probably most of the 20-something males on Reddit. 
This year, at age 5&amp;6:
- they both participated in controlling the burn of a small field; 
- Planted and maintained their own garden;
- My oldest (age 6) operated the tractor recently while her mother and I hung a fence ( I needed her to operate the tension the tractor pulled on the fence while we hung it);
- Both are driving. The oldest can pretty much drive by herself, but can barely reach a peddle
- Both can/do harvest fruit and food and preserve it. Recently they harvested figs for preserves, elderberries for syrup
- The younger one is interested in electricity, electronics and robotics (we build robots together)
They won't be taught to "be obedient to men" as you put it. I don't find anything like that in scripture.

Wow that is such a great gift, I am so impressed and I'm happy to see another person teaching a child about money and the right relationships between money and God.
I have sent your niece .01 btc. Happy birthday!
My daughters are 5 &amp; 6. My oldest turns 7 this weekend. I routinely teach her about money and "real" money, in the tradition of the Austrians. She is well-versed on how real silver/gold is better than paper money, and why.
With that knowledge, I also then teach her how the Truth and His word is even more valuable than all money. 
    Pro 3:13  Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding, 
    Pro 3:14  for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold. 
    Pro 8:10  Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold, 
    Pro 8:11  for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her. 
    Pro 8:18  Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and righteousness. 
    Pro 8:19  My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my yield than choice silver. 
When I first taught her about how the scripture can grant wisdom and understanding (earlier this year) and how that is even more valuable than gold and silver and jewels (keeping in mind how I've taught, and am continuing to teach, her about the economy of money) then it really made an impact about how important the Word is. When I first got that through, her eyes got big like saucers and she just asked if she could read my Bible and wanted to read Proverbs. She spent the night in bed doing that.
So, this weekend I'll be giving her first "real" Bible. I plan to present it along with some currency and a stack of silver. First, I'll ask her which is more valuable, the money or the silver real-money. Then I'll ask her which is more valuable the silver or the Word. 
When she gets the answers (which she will...this is easy for us) she'll receive all the gifts as blessings.
Incidentally, along with these lessons and her learning about using money to buy things, we've also been recently talking now about how having money isn't really being "rich". How having money only provides you with things that are temporary and will decay but will never provide salvation, joy or even contentment. That only God can make you rich in spirit and about how that is what counts.
    Pro 11:28  Whoever trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf. 
Peace, Brother.

the initial pmt would be considered ordinary taxable income. That is, whenever the person received the good (e.g. Today).
If it had been received months ago the difference between taxable gain back then and what you sell it for now (or since) is taxed at capital gains, a beneficial rate change from ordinary income.

I see the relationship. I would posit that gold is more similar though, in that you must labor hard to get  gold, it does cause inflation wherein the new gold holder now has some "value" extracted from all gold holders, in a sense. And that exact same thing happens in Crypto as well - miner labors (via electricity) and receives a portion of the total wealth of the network in exchange for contributing to the function of the monetary network.

You and I both clearly support the long-term idea that is bitcoin/cryptocurrency.
I, for one, do not perceive the weakness. I see the HF as a strength. Namely, when a central authority arises and the monetary system begins to form a favored class, then it is time to shift. I think that is what is happening now. The monetary authority is starting to make decisions that appear to disproportionately benefit a seeming select few (e.g. LN) at the cost of the furtherance of the currency around the globe and among merchents, which is what I support.
I simply do not think the cryptocurrency concept is so easily broken as by a simple fork. There should eventually be lots of currencies anyway - we NEED a monetary free market, imo. We are still in the genesis of this whole thing. We may end up with two currencies here and it will be fine. Maybe that's as it should be.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:13:30
To do what with, that's my question.
LN is, if I understand, essentially a private network in which pre-established trust essentially allows for faster transactions, where small items are a prime use case.
Which is fine. But why do the operators of LN need the BTC network/currency at all, other than as a form of payment to be accepted to "fund" your account?

Sure is. I'm barely a bystander. I've decided, though, that the BU approach best represents the original intent that captured my interest - namely that if I do not like the developing monetary authority, I can hard fork the software away and then wait and see if everyone agrees.
So I decided to jump into BU development. I don't get all the hostility though...I envision one day there will be all kinds of currencies and it will be common for people to have multiple currencies in their wallets on their person. A real free-market monetary system.

It's not unreasonable per se, but in an environment in which teleporters are now available, it might be seen as silly by those who are aware of teleporters' availability.
Making the same claim before the teleporters came around is just advertising and would hardly garner any attention.
Same for paypal. No one did the "parody" thing until this particular commercial and for the particular reason that paypal is claiming to be "new money". In an environment in which we actually have some "new money", that now seems a bit silly.
Silly, and worthy of making fun of, in a sort of social commentary sort of way. 
Basically, Paypal is nothing more than a victim of the times. They are selling horse carriages in the new age of the automobile. Some folks pointed that out and they, in traditional big corp fashion, are going to suppress that idea as long as possible. Shareholders and all...
Edit2 (sorry..at work): I should point out there is probably some additional motivation b/c of the particular role money plays in our society (vs transportation). Many people think conventional monetary systems are pretty bad for society and feel strongly so,  so it's not too much a surprise that a company seen to be part of the "established money" and which appears to be attempting to take advantage of the *idea* of bitcoin is parodied directly in the context of the same advertising campaign in which they are attempting to benefit from the idea of "digital money" which they did not actually contribute to creating.
Remember, before today Paypal was just a payment service thing for online payments. Not much different than my bank's web UI. That's not anything like actually "being" money, academically. So...you know, it's pretty common for people/business to get flack (like parody) when they make grand self-promoting gestures like this.

This doesn't make much sense other than parody. Bitcoin isn't a company. No one is advertising anything.
Paypal is a company that provides a service. It is (opinion) ridiculous they would claim to BE new money. Evidently others feel the same and made a parody of the fact.
It wouldn't be a parody if it was entirely new material. It's "funny" because it's true...

I'd like to investigate that comment about being disingenuous. It's an odd human trait that we tend to perceive someone with a different opinion as being "not serious."
My comments here are around the idea that Bitcoin isn't a *thing* with it's own will or profit motive, even as we consider a corporations to be so.
Bitcoin is a particular implementation of, and in this case arguably represents the general case of, alternative types of money. 
Paypal isn't even in the "money" business, at least as I understand the service of "money" having studied economics both academically and individually as well as my education in accounting (I've got a macc).
Processing money, processing payments, escrow services, etc. all that is relevant to money, but it isn't the money itself, like Bitcoin. 
If the exact same thing was done for...I don't know, some other payment clearing *service* then fine. 
Saying bitcoin is a competitor to paypal is like saying the dollar is a competitor to paypal.
We might imagine someone invented a teleporter that is freely available to anyone. If you want, you can push a button and get/make your own teleporter with little effort.
Ford comes along and makes an advertisement that their new car is so special it's like having a new means of transportation.
Then someone takes that ad and makes a parody that effectively is sending the message of "Why don't you just go get the teleporter, you can do that now. It really IS a different means of transportation."

You don't really understand inflation. Inflation is a mechanism whereby wealth is transferred out of the pockets of money-holders into the hands of usually the monetary authority - i.e. banks. Banks a precisely the initial beneficiary of inflation.
"Rising prices" is not inflation. Inflation is correctly defined as an expansion of the money supply and may *appropriately* considered as an expansion that exceeds the value of actual work done to inflate the currency - which in the case of modern money is close to zero effort (one of the benefits of crypto is that the inflation is at least *backed* by some outpouring of effort by the beneficiary of the inflation).
"Rising prices" is just a consequence of inflation, and to the degree that it *helps* some poor slob who doesn't know he built the walls of his own debt-prison I'm not sure can be counted as an actual positive contribution to society.

"bitcoin becomes massive settlement layer"
On the big block side, you also have at least 1 long-time computer scientist and programmer who also spent &gt;20 years casually studying economics from an austrian persepctive, who later earned a master of accountancy and CPA and who thinks "big blocks" is the "right" and "best" way to have a free-market money that best serves individuals.

This was my impression of the core team over a year ago and why i decided to get involved as a developer.
My perspective was that I got into Bitcoin in the very beginning but I was also in grad school and couldn't spend the time on it. I think I even mined but I remember thinking that even if Bitcoin actually became worth something, the probability of me "keeping up" with the keys was pretty close to zero. 
So I just kinda went away. When I got back there was this 1M actual cap (I don't mean like before, when 1M was effectively "no cap") and once I spent enough time reading and things, I eventually I discovered Reddit-Bitcoin and the small block/big block debate. And I'm thinking "this is a debate?". And blockchain and banks and investors....and you know what I think is that now the core group is essentially infested with money interests.
Then, yeah all the "store of value" talk, it seemed pretty clear to me the focus had changed to one in which the most immediate concern was asset value (i.e. bitcoin price) rather than focusing on making some functional money that will help people.
And that was before I had ever heard of Jihan Wu or Roger or BU and certainly before BCH. 
A "fork" does not mean that one is the original and the other is not. It means there are now two copies of the original, neither of which is exactly like the original.

One of the main problems with your argument, strictly speaking from my own pov (I do not mean to dispute the veracity of your thinking) is that I have an independently differnet opinion.
For me, its way beyond "do your own research". What research should I do? I am building code here daily. I understand the software more and more every day. I have studied CS, econ, accounting (I am a macc and cpa), I spent my entire career almost working in IT - databases, software, infosec (former cissp)/network sec.
And like I said, I sincerely have studied economics both in school and as a life-long personal endeavor.
And in my opinion the block size limit was preventing growth, plain and simple. And in my opinion BCH has more utility both philosophically and practically.
I mean, that's just me. But the main point of all this post is to offer testimony from ONE that not everyone who supports BCH or who thinks it better represents the original philosophy just "got it from Reddit/Roger/Jihan".
Roger Ver is entertaining but he's not really qualified enough that I would allow his opinion to much influence my own. Why would I?
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:21:26
I'm conveying a story, take it or leave it.
When I started, it was not much more than an interesting computer science experiment and as a cs and econ minor (having made past years a hobby of studying monetary policy and economics from an austrian pov) it was really interesting - but  I worked full time and was in school for round 2.
Anyway, that meant I didn't stay connected to the community or latest developments (e.g. reddit/asics). When I got back to the community, it wasn't what I recognized.
When I decided to pursue the technology, the BU community had the same sense of purpose that I remember. From my perspective, knowing that a name is only a name, the branch of the fork (both software and philisophical) that most seemed to retain the same/similar sense of purpose that I remember in those early days was/is BU/BCH. imo.
