Lmfao, you ain't a hero nor a moron, you are a grade a troll xD
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:35:32
We are not hopeless, we make money on people who have no idea what they are doing. Sounds harsh but that's how markets work.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:38:18
Sorry but you are a complete moron.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:58:03
Lol the same mentality right now as it was during the dot com bubble.  
Makes you wonder.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:20:20
Just click log on your chart with monthly candles.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:00:34
You forgot to say HODL.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:00:23
Hey, sheep will sheep, what can ya do.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:37:52
In a month the title should be "If you are HODLing and are completely rekt... raise your hand"
Go downvote me to the ground lmfao
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:24:24
With that logic you will never cash BTC.. lmfao
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:45:50
I mean if it was her dream why not?
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:39:11
Check this video what I was talking about couple of days ago:
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:50:12
Can someone sell me BCH with a discount?
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:54:51
xD.. okay
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:22:33
Why are you hating on her?
@_date: 2018-05-08 00:31:08
Brian Kelly talking about it here:
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:20:45
I wouldn't be that optimistic.. I don't think BTC will keep going on for another year like this, maybe couple of months..  
It is very good to start being careful at these times.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:18:33
By the mods or me?
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:39:04
Shameless self promotion, basically looking at charts and trading the patterns, wave recognition and market psychology:  
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:17:27
Yes, I explain whats happening right now with the markets here, some really good info here:  
   
  
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:18:59
If you want help I would wait until I invest. Like wait a year.  
Yes many people will disagree with me and downvote this into oblivion because we all are going to be rich, driving lambos on some exotic beaches.  
If you are interested listening to a different side of the picture I am more than glad to talk about it.  
  
And before you assume, I am not talking how bitcoin is a scam, no, I love the tech and think its revolutionary, it will hit prices around 60k in the future but not now.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:00:37
Oh trust me, I know what is coming, but not now.  
  
This bubble will pop, try to remember what I just said. Bitcoin HAS to cool off before it goes for prices like 20k.. Hell I even think it will go to 100k but that will happen in 10 years or so, but it cant keep going up forever..  
  
I am browsing this subreddit and everyone is just so euphoric, when (Its a matter of when, not if) the bubble pops people will most likely keep on holding and reassuring everyone to continue holding but in the end sell at the bottom because they cant stand the psychological stress of seeing their investments at 60% loss. It is all market psychology and repeats every time over and over again.  
  
What I think is we will reach prices at around 10k or 11k at around Xmas and then we will start seeing a market crash, complacency and 2013 will relive once more. People have to LOSE money for other to make, and everyone who is entering now will probably get rekt unless they hold longerm (Years).  
  
I even might get downvoted for what I said, everyone thinks they are the smartest people in the world for investing practically at the top.  
  
Just my 2 cents.
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:43:38
Oh BTW, I am curious, how long have you been in the crypto world?  
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:17:04
A disclaimer due to a very unwanted and unpopular subject:  
I am not predicting a dip right now, I am not saying short the market. This is an overview of the whole market and explanation on market cycles and crowd behaviour. Take it however you want, time will show in the end.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:13:48
I see 2 scenarios for you.. You will keep your word and keep holding or just sell at a 60% loss when this thing pops..  
I know its an unpopular opinion but if you are interested I could go in more detail.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:13:20
More like next year taking a 60% loss.. Its a bubble people, its going to pop in a month or two..
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:38:05
When did you hear about Bitcoin btw?
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:56:05
Oh sorry for the confusion, I remember reading a comment when someone said in 2 years you would get 300%, I was just quoting that comment.. From the video "People gonna say just hold and in 2 years you will get your investments back and you will be in profit".  
  
But yes, I think people who buy now and actually have the nerves of steel to hold for 10ish years they will be in profit again and might multiply the account. Problem is how the market cycles and human psychology work and how, as I said, it is a psychological torture holding to your investment with 60% loss, at some point you will say "Ah fuck it, let me just get out of here."  
  
Thanks for having an open mind! :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:17:26
This comment perfectly describes what I have been discussing last day..  
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:36:20
lol....   
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:32:58
I am taking traditional markets as an example sure, but also mainly comparing it to previous market cycles of bitcoin like 2013 and some altcoins. I am not new to the scene, just a quiet lurker who has been trading since the beginning of the year and am getting more careful the higher prices we see.  
One thing is for sure, you cant really guess the top of a bubble.  
  
As for my strategy, when the bubble bursts I will cash out into FIAT in complacency but NOT until I see some signs of a bear market.  
  
P.S.  
Thanks for being open minded, really surprised me you can have a normal, civil conversation here! Maybe I will be posting more in the future! :D
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:08:49
Take a step back and look at the chart of bitcoin. Take a good look at the 2013 area and compare it with the current price. Yes bitcoin is revolutionary, yes it will reach 50k at some points but there is a thing called market cycles and crowd behavior.  
Just take a look at this video and before you downvote watch until the end, it is an objective look at the current state of the market:
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:14:37
I was talking about people selling their cars and going into bitcoin a day ago... &gt;.&lt;  
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:18:01
Id buy it in a year, you will see why. lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:31:59
Checkout my post history for a link to a youtube video, puts things into perspective. Don't listen to people telling you to buy.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:04:59
Dont really have any opinion on that to be honest.. Its still way too early to tell..
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:30:29
Check this video out, puts things in perspective:  
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:24:26
Oooh I see, fair enough ^^
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:11:55
They will have a serious grudge when BTC crashes, it will happen soon.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:32:38
You will just get downvoted, I feel euphoric people cant accept anything but "it will go up" and "we will be rich". Curious about the dot com bubble tho, would like to ask you about that because I think after this pops other bubble will be as big as the dot com one if not bigger.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:23:26
Sell the bottom and buy the top.. Ofc..
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:54:47
Yeap, you pretty much are the mainstream sucker who bought the top..
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:57:21
If you asked that question 2 months ago you would get burned alive by the mob who was so delusional.. 
Check out the video I made 2 months ago saying BTC is going to crash and read the comments, then go ahead and check out my latest video, nobody to be seen around.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:39:59
Hmm?
