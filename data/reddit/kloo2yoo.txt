why not?
I downloaded two, linux dvd images at about 1gb each, earlier today.  It took about an hour each time, but it wasn't *really* inconvenient.

wait.  I thought fear leads to anger.  I'm so confused.

Sorry, I thought we were already discussing people who could afford a $200 graphics card, or at least the international equivalent to $40 - $60 USD in order to afford bitcoins.
