This is the main argument in [Cryptoassets]( even if you don't like Bitcoin it actually will help a portfolio get better returns with lower volatility. Though, the author was pushing for a 1% investment in Bitcoin for all portfolios.

Please dump to $950. I’ll buy way more BTC at that price.

Very cool, thanks man

Long term capital gains is just 15%. Just HODL or pay your taxes. No reason to commit fraud and risk ending up in jail.

Thanks, man!

I withdrew some today and it confirmed really fast. It was the fastest I’ve ever experienced.

This is hilarious. Just played it with my daughter.
My only gripe is that I still saw ads after paying to have them removed when I used my 1UP. I feel like you should pull all the ads if we pay .25mBTC for the game.
Back to the pump and dump!

4x the block speed (2.5min target rather than 10min)

Same here. There’s a possibility it was Szabo + Hal, but he has to be at least part of Satoshi.

He can move one BTC to his wallet from Satoshi’s and prove it once and for all. But he won’t because he isn’t.
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:55:30
That would be the greatest moment in crypto.

The lawyer who wrote this letter still hedges on whether "Dr Wright" is Satoshi Nakamoto. 


Such BS, he just needs to move 1 BTC from Satoshi's horde to prove that he's Satoshi. But he can't do that because he isn't.

You're right. I'm going to have to edit some of my comments. But it's still incredibly damaging to Wright in this case and in his other lawsuits. 
One of the allegations in the Complaint is that: 


It doesn't look good when you forge exhibits in a case about whether you forged contracts.

This is in the Southern District of Florida, a Federal Court with really smart judges. The people being sued will be able to oppose the motion to withdraw that email and will absolutely use it against Craig Wright. 
This is going to get introduced into his other lawsuits, but it's particularly damaging in this case. Here's one of the allegations from the Complaint: 


Dave’s assets to Craig and/or companies controlled by him. **Craig backdated
these contracts** and forged Dave’s signature on them.
It's going to be hard for his lawyers to withdraw this motion. It's pretty important to find out if he's forging exhibits in a case about whether he forged contracts. 
His lawyers had to file this motion, but that doesn't mean the Court will allow it.

Haha, moving some of Satoshi's horde would be near indisputable proof.
@_date: 2019-04-30 21:48:56
He could be found in contempt of court which could get him jail time. He's royally screwed.
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:06:55
Ya, I admitted you were right and edited my comment. I got this case confused with the score of other cases where Craig Wright is the plaintiff.
@_date: 2019-04-12 20:36:18
I honestly have no clue. It's such a strange thing for him to argue about whether he's Satoshi when there are cryptographic ways for him to prove his identity. 
Does he expect us to believe that the creator of bitcoin lost his key? That he doesn't have access to any his Satoshi addresses? 
If he honestly turns out to be Satoshi, I feel like the bluster and suing people is like a reverse false flag to make us think he's a fraud. There are so many things that show he isn't Satoshi it's not just bad luck.
@_date: 2019-04-14 03:55:20
You may be right, that's not something I've ever dug into. 
But, if they aren't all Satoshi's, wouldn't that increase the chances that Wright would have access to some? 
The fact that he can't/won't move some of the earliest coins is pretty strong evidence that he isn't Satoshi.

Use a Coinbase Pro (formerly GDAX) account, move the money there before you sell to get the best rates
