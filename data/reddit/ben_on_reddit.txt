While I'd love to agree just for the conviction and the joy of mining, I think that this is maybe a bit too enthusiastic? Difficulty will rise over time, maybe the miner conks out, things like that.
Eventually, mining almost never is profitable on spot, but if you consider mining altcoins and selling them later you can almost always do a good deal. Of course, there are gazillions of possibilities, and if it isn't profitable for someone, at least he learns about blockchains and IT, so that's a plus as well.

Just sayin', that's roughly 1200 USD per month which accounts to a solid sidejob in Berlin, Germany, seemingly first world country.

And in lots of other places. I have the feeling that many people in US, Germany etc severely underestimate how well they’re doing. And man, Warsaw is beautiful.

Nope - if it was for free, it would have no value, wouldn't it? ;-)

Man I'm in the same boat and have the feeling that we have to earn our medals by trial, error, asking, repeat

Well it's a bit philosophical here probably, but one of the value propositions of proof-of-work-algorithms would seem to me that by converting energy and effort (cost, hardware, time building it etc) into blocks on a blockchain (that validate a network, that keep a blockchain alive, that process transactions, ...) you create value.

I agree - I just thought it's a solid example for an unexpected comparison, since Berlin is (or was) a place-to-be. I know from friends in media that the average monthly salary might well be around 1200€ (after taxes) just because the city is so popular. Electricity bill might equate to roughly 100€ per month if you are sporting a rig that makes close to 900€ in 30 days with a solid PSU.
