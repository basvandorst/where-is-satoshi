Yes. It must have been like this. Otherwise it would as well have to display a volume of maybe some billions of dollars.

Yes, true. I just wondered why the opening of bakkt futures trading as well as crossing a volume of 1000+ BTC today came along with remarkable price drops.
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:19:48
And what about the coinbase drop to $0.06? Does someone remember what happened there? Or was this just kind of a messed chart display?
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:27:11
I guess, no one wants to dump BTC back to 6¢ (That conjecturally happened on coinbase, on Apr 13 2017, had nothing to do with Bakkt).
But I think it could happen for the same reason, why someone trades short at all.
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:31:48
Alright. So, rather percepetible than remarkable.

No. This way of thinking is FOMO. Otherwise, you can buy at any price and wait 4 years to make profit (this did not fail up to now since BTC exists).

I fourth this.

So that means,- let me calculate.... that Bitcoin MUST finally be higher than $20k by December 2021. Or the theory proves to be wrong :-)

Bitcoin is not (and never was) anonymous. Transactions happen on a *pseudonymous* base (meaning that one can possibly link your wallet addresses to your personal ID just by carefully analyzing Metadata on the blockchain).   
But there are alternative cryptocurrencies with a main focus on privacy (including anonymous TAs), like Monero, Dash or Z-Cash.
@_date: 2019-05-05 15:45:56
Exactly. Privacy coins are just more simple with transacting anonymously.
@_date: 2019-05-05 20:01:00
Well, very kindly I advise you considering *why* most exchanges ask for an age verification... Maybe - just wait a bit?
@_date: 2019-05-03 09:13:12
Where? On Bitfinex? That's just because so many ppl trying to quickly sell their USDT off for BTC...
@_date: 2019-05-05 21:02:04
I cautiously assume that reward halving could last longer than the American election system.... uh. And on top of that bitcoin is a worldwide matter.
