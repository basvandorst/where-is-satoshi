 - get a smart current account and use it to send money to kraken.com (who use the same bank to receive). This works well and the fees are low - £2.49 sepa fee and the GBP to EUR conversion happens more or less at spot.
localbitcoins.com also works pretty well.. with premiums usually under 5% and with the benefit of instant delivery.
bitbargain.co.uk works the same as localbitcoins, but their premiums are much higher.. on the other hand the process is even faster and usually doesn't require ID.
there are also some sites that take visa/mastercard;

The funds you will receive are already in your payment channel with your immediate upstream.. if he signs a payment to you then you have them and your upstream can't get them back from you even if somehow the sender could get them back from him.. but since your upstream would only release funds to you once his upstream (whether the original sender or some other intermediary) pays him there's no way that could happen either.
There's no issue with doublespends on the lightning network, and if things go well they can confirm instantly. If parties along the path are uncooperative it can take a long time to confirm.. like basically if they say they'll relay a payment and then don't you have to wait for timeouts and attempt sending via someone else.. but there's no way anyone can steal.. this possibility to dos the network by advertising a route and then failing to relay does mean that there will probably be a tendency to prefer reputable intermediaries rather than anonymous unknown ones and that may have some centralisation effects.
