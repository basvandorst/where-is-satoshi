Refer back to my comment. Someone can be right and a scammer at the same time. Theres people who knlw hes a scammer and are also able to use their brains to pick apart the useful info from the bullshit

Scammers scam people that are not as smart as the scammer

Well what would you consider a 'valid technical analysis'? Also I'm down to buy more bitcoin. Made $100 yesterday trading using a crystal ball and dowsing rods. 
Funny now tho how you're admitting he was right just for the sake to keep arguing. Good work ;)

That makes no sense. They're still getting scammed even if they don't think they are. Because the scammer is smarter and scammed them. 
I guess you're just commenting irrelevant shit either way

What reality is that? I don't think you really understood my comment, did you

This has nothing to do with the analogy in OP.  Also "analogies sound cool"? Are you 15. Also, if ya wanna take it back to the analpgy, the analogy refers to the accumulation stage of Finance markets/Technical Analysis which has been used since before crypto was a thing. So yes, it "sounds cool" lol and is also correct. Cue the "TA is useless pseudoscience!!" comments even tho people make money using it
