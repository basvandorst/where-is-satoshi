But hasn't this always been true even long before Bitcoin? Pre-FDIC banks, and more recently in Europe when the government (of Greece?) took funds directly from accounts of private citizens and businesses to help recover the country from financial ruins.

The "no tips and competitive wages" part has no bearing on whether Bitcoin would be helpful here. The "no cash" is just to discourage cash, not completely deny it. Bitcoin would be just as good anywhere else as here. Just because a company is doing something different doesn't mean they are somehow the perfect Bitcoin acceptor.

Without the block chain downloaded your client will not be aware of your BTC balance and will therefore be unable to send since you don't have anything to send, as far as the client is concerned.  This is, of course, if you're downloading the chain from scratch.

You can use an online wallet to store your BTC, so you don't need to install anything on your computer. All you need is a method of transferring cash to a BTC exchange, like Mt Gox. Places like Silk Road have sellers who will allow you to convert gift cards or other prepaid cash cards to BTC.

When i first got into BTC i created a TC volume and put it on Dropbox. I found this to be ineffective since (I think) due to the nature of TC volumes being pre-allocated, Dropbox didn't detect changes in the data, meaning any new addresses created were not synced, rendering Dropbox useless. Sounds like an encrypted archive is easiest and effective.

The last thing I'd want to do is encrypt confidential information using a web service run by someone I don't know.  Who's to say messages aren't being funneled back to the provider and stored?
EDIT: It says nothing is transferred, and I'm sure someone can inspect the JavaScript to verify, however, that could change instantly, and unless you're auditing the code EVERY time before you encrypt a message, you can never be 100% sure you're safe.

Yes, but someone will make an argument about tracking ammo sales (like they do with pseudo-ephedrine sales, to prevent meth production), and then the Internet will come up, and Bitcoin will be targeted as a tool to enable criminals to obtain weapons and ammunition (which you can already do, but it'll just come into the spotlight).

To properly become anonymous one would cash out BTC to a new address in their wallet rather than the one they funded their Mt Gox account with.

The problem is that Bitcoin doesn't have any value outside of the conversion to local currency.  Establishing a trustworthy and accessible (and low tech-knowledge required) exchange is key to allow Bitcoin to work in 3rd world countries.

It says that data is backed up once a day.  That would be fine if this were user-generated data that could be recreated in the event of a data loss, however, considering that if an address is created, receives coins, and then is lost due to a failure/data loss all before the nightly backup, any BC sent to the new address will be permanently lost.
A better solution would be to provide a much more frequent backup and/or replication configuration to significantly reduce the time frame that is open to such a loss.
@_date: 2011-06-23 18:24:28
This would require coordination between exchanges!  Bitcoin doesn't give any inherent value to BTC, that  value is assigned by users trading in exchanges.  Therefore, to cause trading to halt, all exchanges would need to be involved.

Really people, we're going to sit here and complain about how the banks are making all of this money off of doing nothing, but Bitcoin is so much better because banks don't get the fees? Someone calculated about $500 million was paid to miners in 2013, and that is based off of a mere fraction of the amount of money processed by the banks we're complaining about. Apples to apples, if Bitcoin processed the same dollar amount as the banks, what would be paid to miners? If the banks made $1.7 trillion on the equivalent of miner fees, that's about 3400 times what miners made in 2013 (according to the other poster). I would be surprised to find that the banks processed only 3400 times more transactions than Bitcoin that year; I'm guessing it's much greater than that. So yes, with Bitcoin it's decentralizing  those fees, but as it is now the banks are the ones doing the "work" of running the network, so they get all the fees. I don't see this in particular as being an issue. 
All in all, I love and support Bitcoin, but I think the fee argument is a non-issue, as it would appear Bitcoin is more expensive and disliking banks for keeping fees earned for a system they designed and run is just silly. 
Edit: This [article]( states that in the US there was about $4 trillion of transaction volume by credit cards in 2014. The article in the OP is talking about revenue from all banking transaction processing worldwide, not just credit cards. It doesn't mention what the transaction volume was to create that fee revenue, but I would imagine we're talking about 10s to 100s of trillions of dollars, at least. As I said below in another comment, it's difficult to predict what Bitcoin would look like at the equivalent volume, but I don't think the result would be nearly as impressive if we looked at a 1-to-1 comparison. 
Edit 2: I read another article a little while ago suggesting that the total transaction value of all transactions the OP is talking about was approximately $630 trillion in 2014. The numbers following are rough estimates, so take them with a grain of salt. $1.7T is 0.27% of $630T. According to [this]( chart the mining percentage of the value of transactions processed is roughly 2.3% over the last year (I'm on mobile so I have limited access to specific historical data). This is approximately 850% greater than the fees charged by traditional payment processors. The equivalent would be $14.45T.
Like I said, none of these totals are concrete, but I am pretty sure that the banking industry is charging a lot less per-transaction than miners are making.

It's not inefficient, it's a business model they've chosen to operate with. I'm positive costs could be lowered if they chose to, but until they have real competition there is no incentive.

This sucks.  I understand why they've done this, but I'm cashing out my BTC from Tradehill.  I'll be damned if I'll pay $5 or possibly $25 to transfer USD back to my bank account.  That'll eat even further into the already minimal profit (or possible loss) that I see on my BTC trade.
@_date: 2011-06-22 18:38:29
You don't even need two wallets, I don't think.  You can send from one address to another, both of which are contained in a single wallet.dat file.
@_date: 2016-05-15 14:02:51
If you remove the mining reward and are left with only transaction fees, and then scale the network to process the same amount of transactions as the banking systems, what would the revenue amount be? I don't think anyone can say at the moment, but I think when the dust settles, if we ever do reach that point, the difference will be much less impressive than the article suggests. 
@_date: 2013-06-01 19:09:31

That seems plausible.  Absolutely no reason to suspect that a modded kill screen from ICE w/ the SR logo is legit.  Most likely the server is still up and running, albeit with everything disabled.

I agree with you about the user funds, though; I'm not sure how they could automate the flow of BTC without saving a key or manually entering it.

I highly doubt it's a hoax, for all of the reasons you've said.  Others have suggested that the SR logo and "hidden service" text might have been part of the self-destruct code that SR had programmed in, and that the server may not actually be controlled by the feds (which is different than them obtaining an image of a server in the summer, as the document said).
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:03:49

Before I read through the whole report, I thought he had solicited a hitman from SR to do the deed, but the report says FriendlyChemist was blackmailing DPR because he owed his distributor money, DPR told FriendlyChemist basically "put your distributor on the phone", and the next day, another guy, redandwhite, messaged DPR saying "I'm the distributor; what's up?".  And at that point DPR says "I need you to kill this guy".  If that's actually how the whole thing went down, then wow, just wow...

If you're suggesting that someone buy and sell in such huge quantities that they could be considered a maker, there's a reason no one hasn't already, and that's because people with that much capital have not deemed it a good investment as of present. That's why a 3rd party (you) saying that someone should step up and do it is pointless.
