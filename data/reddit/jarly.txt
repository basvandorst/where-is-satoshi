Well, for one thing, it makes mining more difficult, and buying more easy. Higher demand = sellers selling at higher prices, right?

* Set host to mtred.com
* Set port to 8337
* Set username to your rpc username
* Set password to your rpc password

There'll be an impact but probably less than 1 mhash/s, well worth it.
@_date: 2011-05-07 15:02:10
Gold will still be valuable when the last oz of gold is found. Blocks will still be used as transaction logs. And I'm pretty sure that Bitcoins will have a higher value when they're all found.
@_date: 2011-05-15 03:21:07
In the long term, bitcoin will remain really profitable.

How do I use Kiv's GUIMiner with this?
@_date: 2011-06-06 00:52:07
Well, if my GPU is stronger than your GPU, then I can double-spend as much as I like.
@_date: 2011-05-10 21:08:14
Use Eligius: no fees, plus you'd get paid more per payout ;)
@_date: 2011-06-04 08:32:31
You think that's high? Look at it now.
@_date: 2011-05-12 05:28:32
Those are for solo mining.
@_date: 2011-06-08 15:03:03
Hashing is an integer operation, not a floating point operation. You can't measure oranges in terms of lemons.
@_date: 2011-05-11 03:08:09
Alright I'm definitely joining this pool.
@_date: 2011-05-14 04:55:44
You're like 10% of the pool :D
@_date: 2011-05-12 05:11:10
You have to make a worker on mtred.com and then use that info with poclbm
@_date: 2011-06-06 19:51:14
I used  once and it worked smoothly and quickly.
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:06:49
Good, but you should tell the user whether or not their password was salted. If it's salted (starts with $1$) then it should be secure, for now. If it doesn't, it's already been cracked.

I would just get a cheap ATi card; my 5750 I bought a year or two ago for $115 gets me 130mhash/s at stock clocks.
What I really can't wait for is the next version of the ATi Folding client; it's only a year and a bit after it was expected to release, lol.
@_date: 2011-06-06 01:37:30
Yes, and their shares will each decrease. So people, trying to satiate their lust for Bitcoins are going to start buying them.
@_date: 2011-05-17 02:57:02
@_date: 2011-05-12 13:41:36
No man, "generate coins" isn't a good idea. If you're using a CPU to mine, you'll probably spend more on electricty than you will get back in bitcoins. [Mine with your graphics card]( and [join a pool](
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:21:46
Damn, just realized that the salt is RIGHT NEXT to the hash. All of the passwords are gonna be cracked.
@_date: 2011-06-29 16:21:01
It's a good idea, however, it's another thing in the system I can see hacked. Keep your tables secure!
@_date: 2011-05-14 20:16:53
I think even 75 is pushing it, running them 24/7. But hey, if they're paid for  by the mining (which they will be soon enough), then go for it.
@_date: 2011-05-02 02:08:43
I'm not sure, but adding "-f60" as a flag might help you with that.
@_date: 2011-05-10 02:51:29
Thanks for explaining that.
@_date: 2011-05-22 15:04:03
Hashing is an integer function, not a floating point function. But if it were, I think we'd be several times the power of Folding
@_date: 2011-06-09 18:45:00
As well as there probably not being a place that accepts Bitcoins, you do have to factor in the transaction time, so that's at least 10 minutes, or for a really nitpicky merchant, an hour. Just my 2c.
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:21:21
I sent the data to a google employee.
@_date: 2011-06-06 02:45:34
I think that would explain the accelerating prices, at least.
@_date: 2011-05-05 23:27:02
It helped a lot for me.
@_date: 2011-05-05 22:00:30
Make it like Eligius except without the 1 btc threshold :D
@_date: 2011-05-01 15:12:57
How many mhash/s?
@_date: 2011-05-11 00:06:29
Thanks :)
@_date: 2011-05-10 03:52:40
Looks like some buyer spent 40,000 dollars at $4.98
@_date: 2011-05-01 17:44:26
So jealous... Also, where did you get a 5780 (do you mean 5870?) for that price?
@_date: 2011-07-02 00:04:12
@_date: 2011-05-03 05:15:10
I feel like something 'clicked' about preventing doublespending when I read the part about how the artist can proclaim that he only made one edition. Also, are you Kiba on the bitcoin forums?
@_date: 2011-05-18 00:12:10
 might help
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:37:51
Yeah I'm sure. Like, look at user number 1, jed:
$1$E1xAsgR1$vPt0d/L3f81Ys3SxJ7rIh/ is the total string. Between the $1$ and the next $, the salt is E1xAsgR1 and the hash is vPt0d/L3f81Ys3SxJ7rIh/, encoded some way we yet have to find out.
@_date: 2011-06-02 04:40:36
Send them to me, of course!
@_date: 2011-05-05 14:45:56
I know that the bitcoins will eventually end up in your client.
Bitcoin calculator says:
Probability	Time
Average	8 days, 6 hours, 14 minutes
50%	5 days, 17 hours, 24 minutes
95%	24 days, 17 hours, 53 minutes
For 1 bitcoin
edit: you're gonna want to turn your memory clocks all the way down to ~400MHz because they don't help with mining.
edit2: for 1 block, or 50 bitcoins
edit3: my temps went down 20 degrees doing this :D
@_date: 2011-05-05 14:47:35
Turn your memory clocks down as far as you can as long as it remains stable.
@_date: 2011-05-01 17:48:46
I think it has to do with ATi's OpenCL API vs nVidia's. A bit of googling also led to this: 




It also does look like you can set up ATi Stream for Adobe Premiere, but I haven't tried.
@_date: 2011-05-11 05:19:26
Hash/s rate? Sounds awesome, dude.
