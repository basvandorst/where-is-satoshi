I'm a complete newbie, I thought that mining wasn't viable because at the end of the day the electric bill would be bigger than the amount of bitcoins that I can mine

My reasoning is this: if this were just some pyramid scheme I wouldn't be bothered, but since it's probably straight up theft I think he's damaging the app I'm using. I mean... He is not even interested in learning languages, he just uses it to steal money from innocent people. And I like the app, and use it for free.

Millions?? Believe it or not this is the first time I receive a scam attempt from an actual human being

He says "Create a bitcoin wallet account 
To go your playstore on your phone and download  luno bitcoin"

Yes I just wanted to be sure

For example he says the following:
"through my own antminer it makes my own mining and yours faster it also increases the harsh rate of the miner making me and you earn more and I also earn 5% of their mining monthly so I earn and you earn it's a win situation for us."

I know nothing about bitcoins, but this element alone made me guess it's probably a scam. Probably this means I'm a bad person

At this point what should I do? Do I ask him for details and report him to some kind of authority?

So you say it's not even a Ponzi scheme... it's just straight up theft !

I added his messages to my OP, I know it's a scam because investing doesn't work like this, I'm just curious about what kind of scam this might be
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:18:32
Ok I'll edit all the messages he sent me on my OP
@_date: 2019-09-03 10:41:23
So what are you saying exactly? That this one is not a scammer?
