Sia’s partner r/rendertoken will eventually be working on a proof of effort algorithm, using the heavy workload of GPU ray tracing as a basis to secure a network. It is unclear if such Proof of Render is even possible, but the company behind the project has the most knowledge about ray tracing in the industry.
ASIC’s for ray tracing are magnitudes harder to build as you require basically a full GPU where you add a RT engine to it. This has not been achieved until today (as there was no real market for it) and it is cerainly outside the crypto hardware manufacurers‘ near term capabilities.
Last but not least will the eventual rise of RT ASIC‘s not destroy the RNDR market because it is not a limited block reward that is shared among all miners online. Instead it is paid work and a scheduler distributing the work. The total amount of revenue is constantly growing with demand for CGI. The more power is available the more complex and bigger the jobs eventually become. The largest thing we can imagine today is room size light field renders or real-time ray tracing when latency problems while streaming are solved.

Minor question: what‘s the business model of that company?
