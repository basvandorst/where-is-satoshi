Well after today's big drop. I doubt that banks and big money investors would like to invest in bitcoins. We had a test to keep the price high. We failed.

I sent $2000 usd through wire transfer about 10 days ago and nothing. I keep sending them support tickets and they dont answer. After a couple of hours my support ticket turns from green to red and they never answer even though it says open. About 2 days ago I payed Bank of America $25 to try got my money back and they called their bank to get my money back and according to Bank of America they're saying that they dont know what money I'm talking about when I even have the confirmation that the transfer was done.

I'm Cuban but live in the US. Citizens in Cuban dont even have access to internet in Cuba, only one's that do work for the government and not all of them just the high ranked one's. So no hope. I'll say that 70% of their population doesn't even know how to turn on a computer. Also who ever said private enterprises are legal now. Well that's a lie, you have to be approved by the government which gives them the right to shut you down when ever they want. Plus they control everything and cannot sell any products that were not Made in Cuba.
