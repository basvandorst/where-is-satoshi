You guys seriously just close your eyes and swing for the fences. Do you understand how shakey this market is right now?
Sure, buy what you can if you have a lot of disposable income. But I can't imagine bitcoin going back to $20k anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-07-15 16:56:00
Lol I see shit like this and it’s a buy signal. I bought 10 more ETH yesterday at around $210. People are way too emotional and I’m gonna use that to my advantage. Buy when there is blood.
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:37:30
You’re terrible at getting your point across.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:56:07
She sounds kind of cold. How about "Hey thank you so much for buying me that bitcoin back in 2013, that was so sweet of you. I want to use to to re-do my kitchen. Could you help show me how to sell it into dollars?"
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:17:43
Did you get fucked by buying the top, then panic sold the bottom? I bet you did.
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:16:25
LOL thats why the high prices are there? To get "media attention?" Jesus Christ.
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:13:49
I just ask them what criminals used before BTC. They will usually say "the dollar." Then I say, did you know the FBI prefers criminals use BTC for criminal activity because every single transaction is documented on a public ledger? With cash, that isn't possible. Their heads start to spin because they realize they have no idea WTF they're talking about.
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:01:11
The day the CBOE launched futures trading, bitcoin skyrocketed.
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:15:23
WTF are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-07-13 18:06:03
I see it as a way to invest in the company and also get discounts on goods or services affiliated with it. Almost like a stock and currency in one. Who knows though.
@_date: 2019-07-15 20:13:58
Alright bud relax
@_date: 2018-09-09 03:43:59
LOL oh man...
@_date: 2018-08-23 21:05:58
The really shitty thing though is that when all these ETFs are officially announced to be disapproved, the market will crash again even though we already know it’s not gonna go thru. I am seriously considering selling temporarily.
@_date: 2019-03-23 19:19:58
How do you figure that 
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:15:34
@_date: 2018-10-04 14:50:41
Are people automatically “libs” if they don’t want to blow the president like you?
@_date: 2018-10-23 17:44:13
Uh.... wtf? Yeah they have colleges in Kenya. Go back to r/the_donald
@_date: 2018-10-12 15:19:23
Sad thing is at my ATH return last year I could have bought a Lambo. I HODL’d like an idiot and that Lambo has turned into a nice new Honda Accord.
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:04:31
Lol grow up
@_date: 2018-10-09 15:54:40
Did you type that up when you were drunk?
@_date: 2018-10-31 20:45:09
Didn’t the price crash pretty hard after he bad mouthed it? I’m a bitcoin fan, but we have to be objective. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 09:30:16
So you are so thickheaded that you can’t fathom the possibility of someone being objective enough to be able to look at each of the issues you’ve listed above, even come to the same conclusions as you have, but at the same time, dislike Trump?
Are you slow? Seriously. What is wrong with you Trump fanatics? This is cult-like thinking. This may come as a shock to you, but people are perfectly capable of wanting strong borders, being pro-gun, and agreeing that there are only two genders, and STILL dislike the slime-ball narcissistic idiot that is Donald Trump. 
Seriously you need to reflect on how limited your view of the world is and maybe consider that you’ve become extremely biased. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:36:14
Maybe the grammar issues all throughout your post confused me.
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:07:56
Lol exactly how did I get “rekt?” That could be anyone’s buy orders and your username is hobbit bro. You’ve rekted yourself your entire life. Are you still a virgin? Genuinely curious.
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:44:01
Oh you gonna cry? You love trumpy right?
@_date: 2019-08-03 02:08:34
What exactly did you want me to tell you at this point? Do you want the internet points? You won this argument bud. Go do a victory lap. You got me good.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:48:56
Nah, we are way up since 3k still bud. Sorry
@_date: 2019-08-02 23:11:15
LOL really bud? Ok i'll spell it out for your dumbass: Gab (the entire fucking subject of this thread) is an alt-right affiliated echo chamber for idiots like you (subs of stupid shit like r/the_donald where you can all suck each other off and spout off stupid shit like "fake news" and post inaccurate memes about your messiah. Also, I can promise you when it comes to morons, you'd have me beat in that category based on this conversation alone. You're likely a sad goofy white dude that lives with roommates in a shitty condo/apartment or you live with your parents. Either way, you attempted to deflect away from the fact that you're a Trump dick-rider, when in reality, you're balls deep in that shit.
@_date: 2019-08-03 02:03:23
unusual interest in objects. need for sameness. great variation in abilities. under or over reaction to one or more of the five senses: sight, touch, taste, smell, or hearing.
@_date: 2019-08-03 01:55:43
That’s retarded as fuck. I didn’t say every single person that goes on the app is that. I will say the majority of regular users very likely are interested moderate to far right ideologies. You dummies are too stupid to debate me.
@_date: 2019-08-03 00:20:15
Good bait man. Can’t stand liberals or republicans. Be independent and research your own shit
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:04:46
Lol your name is hobbit bro. I hope to god you’re a teenager. I also love how triggered you are right now my guy. Post some pics of your goofy face now. Are you an incel too? Hahaha
@_date: 2019-08-02 23:05:26
Stand up for your ideals next time bud. Don’t be afraid to back up your thoughts
@_date: 2019-08-02 23:48:19
Is that all? A semi pro piece on a non-factor candidate that essentially made headlines recently for attacking other Dems in debates? Of course Gab wants to push her. She can divide the Dems
@_date: 2019-08-02 20:47:22
lol I would be. That means you’re still up 33% on your $3k purchase. There are way too many of you no coiners that don’t understand the tech, blockchain, or the long term implications that bitcoin can and will have on the global economy. It’s getting ridiculous and likely many of you just are extremely angry that you’ve lost money on your buys back in 2017. Likely panic sold and rebought higher, etc.
If shit talking investments you don’t hold was a paying job, some of you would be making some decent money. Unfortunately for you guys it’s not. Now for you to respond claiming you still hold crypto, just not “shitcoin.” Etc. Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:59:52
Avoiding the question I see. that is a common trait of someone that knows their opinions could lead people down the rabbit hole of how you really feel.
So I’ll ask again: are you a trump fan?
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:49:36
Cool bud.
@_date: 2019-08-03 00:03:18
Dude that was not a pro dem story are you kidding? Come on man you know how many examples I can show of their members and users being toxic and or tied to hate speech?
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:03:35
Where’s the year big doggy? Lol. Why haven’t you sold by the way? Also that’s prob not even yours
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:19:23
Wait are you really upset? Are you gonna be ok bud? Yess give me the internet “L.” I’m so embarrassed what am I gonna do? My reddit street cred and rep are absolutely fucked! All the subreddits I follow are gonna know about this and I’m gonna be laughed at for at least an hour! Yes sir, you got me good. You won this internet argument and you should feel extremely vindicated. Also, let’s both admit you’re likely a virgin or at the very least, very bad with girls.
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:58:32
See what I mean? You’re claiming you hold bitcoin and bought at $4k, yet you are over here shit talking and hoping for massive drops. You’re full of shit.
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:52:18
Doubtful. Go ahead and post a screenshot of your buys
@_date: 2019-08-03 02:03:44
Go get some fresh air bud
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:14:31
Buddy it’s gonna be ok. You’ll find true love one day. It might be a mail order bride or a cyborg of some kind. Maybe even VR will come along. Hang on to your scraps of bitcoin and maybe one day you’ll get there. Just don’t get so triggered next time and thank your buddy for sharing his buy order screenshots
@_date: 2019-08-03 02:57:24
Lol of course I do.  It’s ok bud you can just shout fake news and run along. No need to actually use logic and reasoning. You have Fox News, and your circle jerk sub Reddit’s to keep you locked up in your beliefs.
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:53:48
You are so cute man. So you’re now saying you have a higher net worth and have had sex with more women? Now I know you’re full of shit. This is so cute though and entertaining as fuck. So how many girls you been with man?
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:33:01
Dude GTFO of here with that BS. You know what these clowns are about and who is drawn to them.
@_date: 2019-08-02 23:16:06
Trump and Gab go hand in hand. It was to see if any of these clowns that rep Gab and it’s ideals would admit they also are hardcore Trump fanatics. Just like them, they avoid the topic because they know deep down that their beliefs and ideals are seen as toxic and ridiculous to most people. It’s their playbook, just like fake news excuses are as well.
@_date: 2019-08-02 23:35:35
Send links let’s see the dem support from them
@_date: 2019-08-02 23:28:42
Nah it’s cool just be real. Don’t fucking hide your ideals when it’s uncomfortable
@_date: 2019-08-02 21:54:26
Lol of course you don’t wanna do that because you didn’t buy any bitcoin at $4000. No one comes on here and talks a bunch of shit on an investment their up 100% on and say the shit you’re saying. You’re just an angry dude that missed the boat. And I’d be happy to bet you a bitcoin you didn’t buy at $4k. If only smart contract betting was mainstream. It’s coming though, little guy.
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:33:37
Lol high alt right lover
@_date: 2019-08-02 23:37:55
I’ve been on gab bud
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:31:25
Nah this is entertaining while I get my tires changed. So let’s talk about your inability to land girls. When did that start for ya? Have you tried looks maxing?
@_date: 2019-08-02 23:00:53
Lol oh wait, you’re a literal subscriber of the r/the_donald sub. Also known as a circle jerk of alt right bullshit
Ok yeah you’re a fucking retard. Got it.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:48:10
It’s a store a value right now. Gold 2.0
There are other cryptos that are more suited for daily transaction right now. Maybe lightning network will change this, but bitcoin is gonna keep going up as a store of value. Now cry more.
@_date: 2019-08-03 00:23:39
If twitter had an absolute massive majority of a set group that represented that said groups ideals, then yes, 100%
You’re not debating with an idiot, man. I’m not going to be tricked into thinking Gab is just some independent platform that just so happens to have a shit load of alt right fanatics that post on it.
@_date: 2019-08-03 02:07:03
Lol I’m self employed
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:02:40
Annnnd it’s down
@_date: 2019-08-02 23:02:28
Don’t be afraid to broadcast who you are. This is a common trait I run into with hardcore trump fans. They never seem to want to admit it until they’re in their echo chambers. Don’t be a little bitch and stand up for your ideals next time.
@_date: 2019-08-02 22:52:20
So are you a trump fan? Just curious big doggy. Let’s see if you dodge the question rather than stand proud
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:24:47
ooof this sub is so cringe.
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:26:28
lol that is terrible advice right now and a great way for them to lose a majority of their money.
Leave it in bitcoin for now.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:34:28
He has .3 bitcoin big dog. Do you wanna maybe relax? I've never seen someone flip out so hard over a reddit comment. Dare I say that it was almost autistic like.
Seriously though, lets play a game. He has .3 bitcoin. How should he split up that money with alt-coins? We can have a look at how he has done after a month then.
By the way, i'm heavily diversified among about 10 different cyrptos. If I would have had it all in bitcoin the last few months, i'd be way more up. Relax little guy. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:55:50
I suggest you watch the YouTube video 10 Million Dollar Bitcoin. Judging current tech and assuming it’s going to stay that way is like judging the internet on its 1995 look. Bitcoin has the most talent behind it and it’s pretty obvious they will address the fees and transaction speeds over time. Right now this is all speculative.
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:52:00
Considering the thread is about him being in college and being proud of the .3 bitcoin he has accrued, I am going to go out on a limb and assume this is the max amount he is currently looking to invest in crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:51:44
I wonder how many people that post on here actually have even one coin. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:23:40
lol so you’re a Bcash shill right? Regardless of how you feel about BTC, you have to realize that BCH is quite the joke. If you’re looking for quicker transaction coins, there are much better choices than that, that aren’t linked to some of the scummiest individuals in crypto. Don’t be a hypocrite. Find the cleanest, easiest and smoothest transaction coin and support it. BCH isn’t it my man,
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:11:34
Spoken like someone that holds hardly any bitcoin and is angry about it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:37:24
BTC is mostly a store of value as of now. If you hate it, move on.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:10:09
I am just a man who knows how to feel.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:04:16
Gotta love the guys username. Sounds like a reasonable and thoughtful individual.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:38:32
It’s possible it never goes mainstream bud 
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:52:08
Lol keep dreaming 
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:58:49
If it drops below $4k people will laugh at these posts and remember this price as “the good times.” 
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:40:56
If all your money is in bitcoin then you are an absolute moron. You lost 25% of your net worth in a week.
@_date: 2018-11-12 03:46:01
Feel shame, huh? You’re delusional. Go get some air.
@_date: 2018-11-17 21:55:29
I just don't see a massive run up again anytime soon. Unfortunately the dumb money from the public poured in all at once and they panic sold all the way down. Its not gonna break through above $6.5k this year. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 08:55:24
Leftist term, huh? If I had a dollar for every time I called out Trump, and the Trump fanatic says “what about Hillary or Obama,” I’d be doing ok financially. You sir are a good example of someone seeing the world through rose colored glasses. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 19:10:08
Oh is that why you gave zero specific examples of Trump fucking up and intentionally then diverted to specifics with Obama? Again, you’re delusional and retarded.
@_date: 2018-11-01 01:05:05
98% of people holding bitcoin unfortunately care a shit ton about the price.
@_date: 2018-11-09 08:56:42
Aaaannnd of course you’re an r/the_donald subscriber. It’s too easy. You guys are so obvious it’s hilarious. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:50:00
It’s just very unlikely. They already make a killing doing what they primarily do. It doesn’t make sense for Starbucks to now allow people to buy bitcoins. The strange media coverage alone would probably be a concern for stock holders as bitcoin has been getting destroyed by media outlets lately due to the drop and huge amount of people losing money.
It is about as likely as Burger King selling Teslas.
@_date: 2018-11-11 13:55:10
Yeah because “Trump is a bad President” is literally the only negative thing people have to complain about Trump......
You’re delusional.
@_date: 2018-11-12 04:36:30
Lol wtf are you even talking about bud? Time to move on with your life.
@_date: 2018-11-11 14:08:26
lol he’s not fucked, the guy is set for life. Are you kidding me with this comment? You don’t think he sold a lot of his coins to dollars and isn’t a multi-millionaire, you’re crazy. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 01:48:21
I’m good. Go watch some infowars
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:13:37
Sure but it’s not worth investing to the point that you need to take out a loan to invest on dips. Come on sir.
@_date: 2018-07-17 13:08:17
You have to be a special kind of loser to waste your time in a subreddit pining for attention from random strangers. Get some air. Maybe find a hobby.

I am kind of in that category you talk about in your last paragraph lol. I know I should probably jump out now, but I hate how much I could have made.
@_date: 2018-07-06 18:25:36
IT still hurts knowing I didn't sell
@_date: 2018-07-17 12:59:34
You guys are so damn quick to jinx any positive momentum with these memes. Premature ejaculation type shit.
@_date: 2018-07-23 08:41:34
Jesus Christ, you along with everyone else has no idea where it’s gonna go.
@_date: 2018-07-11 15:15:01
The problem is the volume is super low now and public interest (dumb money) isn’t coming back in unless we see another crazy bullrun. Unfortunately so many people got burned that I’m not sure we see anything like the 2017 surge again anytime soon. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:57:31

You don’t even have 1 btc. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 04:49:24
Lol he could have sold and bought in again and had more. Not selling is stupid 
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:13:38
You make a whole lot of assumptions. You could have sold at damn near anytime, just one time last year, and rebought right now for more bitcoins. No need to day-trade and call every single top and bottom. Also, you were very sure I didn’t buy and sell, now you’re 100% certain you’ve done better than me, a total stranger. Obviously you are extremely butt hurt about how things have worked out for you and this bear market. It’s written all over your angry and whiny responses. You’re a little bitch. I’m 100% certain of it. And if you’d like, we can post our buys and sells. You’re up buttercup.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:25:39
Bitcoin didn’t come anywhere close to the amount of press and hype it got in 2017. That’s the major difference. Also going from $19,000 to $4000 a coin (even though the percentages are similar to previous dips) is going to kill the dumb money confidence. Of which we never had dumb money like we saw in 2017.
I hope I’m wrong, but this feels very bleak for the HODLERS
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:45:55
[proof for the bitch]( 
@_date: 2018-12-24 09:00:30
Planes being made illegal? You’re an idiot. Goodbye.
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:56:00
It really very likely is different. Extremely likely. This kind of silly mentality to refuse to look at the market variables as a whole as well as HODLing, has cost a lot of people a lot of money.
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:27:01
See ya later man. It’s been fun.
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:52:54
I don’t see crypto recovering above $8k anytime soon. The entire reason we got above $5k so rapidly was hype and extremely dumb money flooding into the space. That hype is all but dead and another rapid ascent is going to take some major bullish news and fomo. It’s not happening for a long long time in my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:48:17
You’re broke bud. I guarantee it 
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:02:02
Let’s see it pussy
@_date: 2018-12-06 03:28:45
News absolutely affects the market. If you don’t think so, you’re absolutely nuts. I’d be happy to provide you numerous examples that pumped and dumped the market last year.
@_date: 2018-12-06 03:56:52
I know you’re probably the type of guy that was reuses to be wrong but I’m sorry but you’re flat out wrong. Work on that. 
In the mean time, here is a website that lists several incidents of news heavily affecting price.
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:57:30
And this has done nothing to the price. In 2017 this news would have pumped us.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:02:34
I think the worst part is people actually type in “what is a” instead of just searching for the subject.
@_date: 2018-12-25 17:57:22
Damn you must have lost a LOT of money. Merry Christmas, little guy. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 03:58:54
Dude shut up. You’re an idiot. Go to the website I just linked and read it. You didn’t even look.
Rumors and news affect price. Now fuck off.
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:01:22
Lol of course they pull this shit during the height of a bear market.
@_date: 2018-12-25 17:25:44
Sold at several points in 2018. Bought in 2016. Did you think that was impossible? Are you autistic?
@_date: 2018-12-02 05:07:23
Leverage how much 
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:23:17
If the US Gov made bitcoin illegal to own and sell, it would KILL the price. Stop being ignorant and naive about this stuff. I understand that bitcoin isn’t governed or owned by anyone, and how the network works, but if the US wanted it dead, it would be nearly dead.
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:49:13
Crypto daily steals all of his memes and intros from reddit and it drives me nuts. People on YouTube actually think he comes up with it all and he doesn’t say a word.
@_date: 2018-12-24 08:51:30
Doesn’t matter what your think or your rationale. If the US gov wanted bitcoin illegal and nearly dead, it would be dead simple for them to do. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:29:03
How can you speak on ethereum when you don’t even understand what litecoin is?
@_date: 2018-12-06 03:40:43
Here’s one of many. Come on man, you can’t seriously think that news doesn’t affect this highly speculative market 
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:34:41
You’re the king of assumptions and you’re more emotional than any girl I’ve ever met. You claim that selling and buying in later for more bitcoins is damn near impossible as well as day trading being unlikely for any random individual. Obviously, with all your statements being made, and your account only being under a year old, it is easy to assume that you’ve lost a SHITLOAD of fiat value on your bitcoins. If you even hold a bitcoin. 
You have a terrible poker face and you’re a whiny baby. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:21:25
You’re one of those that always has to try and be right. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 04:02:12
Lol so you’re going to blatantly avoid the website I posted and the multiple examples of news heavily affecting price. 
Yet again: you’re an idiot. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:20:35
Dude shut the fuck up. You’re a fraud. I see you begging for tiny amounts of bitcoin cash in your comments. You’re broke as shit. Go do something with your life instead of begging.
