Don't take OP personally. You are free to charge whatever your morals and market will bear. 
However, OPs point stands: Bitcoin is expensive to get into if you are Joe Fiat and have heard promises that Bitcoin is less expensive to use than banks. 
So, Joe Fiat buys some Bitcoins from localbitcoins then uses BTC to buy something from say TigerDirect. He will have lost money compared to buying with a credit card (and would have forfeited some consumer protection too offered by CCs). 
Where's the Bitcoin advantage for Joe Fiat?

I am also very skeptical of the evidence presented. 
I did not see any hard evidence besides his name. Is it so hard to assume that out of all Satoshi Nakamotos in existance some would be smart with interest in money and freedom and technology?
Otherwise, he seems, just your regular reasonably smart, aging geek of Japanese ancestry. There is no smoking gun.
This is like the search for DB Cooper, people found tons of people who matched his general description.
I would be more likely to believe this is the real Satoshi:
1. BTC Satoshi code samples were compared with this Satoshi. As it is, Newsweek does not even show proof that he is a hard core programmer.
2. His writing style compared
3. Hmm, some research on his UK knowledge.
4. I don't know, anything else. As it is, it seems this Satoshi was quoted out of context and rest was just pure speculation.
This is very very shoddy journalism. 
It almost seems like a deadline was looming, or the journalist was at a dead end and was just told to wing it.

Well, that is not going to win many converts beyond the ones already on the boat. This is about the same as saying that one should stock up on gold, because one will be able to buy more bread with it in the future.
We are talking about mass adoption. 
I too feel that there are massive challenges to BTC achieving mass adoption.

Faster transaction confirmation times.
~10mins is very inconvenient for small day to day tasks. And of course you want multiple confirmations..
This IMHO is going to be a big hurdle for Bitcoin to overcome, if it ever aspires to become usable as a daily currency. 
I realize that faster confirmation would increase the load on network which along with increased use would bring its own share of problems.
Damned if you do, damned if you don't.

Why would anyone work for 0.04$/hr ??? 
That seems like a big FU rate, only people who would accept that would have to be bored teenagers.

I agree, there may be places in some rural areas where people do not make a lot of cash, although they do barter quite a bit more. In fact, if you frequent you will find people who do just fine in US for less than $10k a year.
I still believe, 0.04$/hr is an unreasonable amount for online work no matter what country. I would be curious to know if one actually gets much work done at that $0.04 rate. 
If there are people willing to work for that laughable rate, then they must be getting something else in return. By that I mean, people often work for free when they feel the project is a worthwhile one (think volunteering at a childrens hospital, open source software, etc.). So this might be the case, that the tiny monetary rewards are of secondary value.
You have to keep in mind, even the shittiest jobs available to international workers on Amazon Mturk come out to about $1 an hour. That is an absolute bottom of the barrel.

Nice analysis, but why are  you grouping Askers/Buyers as one and Bidders/Sellers as one ?
Ask is Sell and Bid is Buy:
You covered supply(selling/asking) side pretty well.
However, the problem may lay with demand. A more detailed analysis would be most welcome.
Who is going to keep buying up these coins?
Let's discount pure speculators, since as you said it is a wash, they just provide liquidity(which is nice).
Every day, roughly 7200(actually more) new BTC enter the world.
Let's be generous and assume that 2200 of those coins are hoarded by small time miners (like myself), who do not need to sell to make back their hardware costs (although many small miners do sell immediately).
Big time miners are going to be selling (if they wanted to hoard they would have bought coins themselves). 
So every day 5000 BTC have to be sold. 
If there is 50,000 USD for them then price falls to $10/BTC, if there is only 10,000USD for them, the price falls to $2/BTC.
One last thing: **It doesn't really matter if many miners go out of business the daily pie stays roughly the same.**
Every day those excess coins have to sold. Who will buy them, if not new blood?

Falkvinge makes a good second point about invested people. That is there quite a few of us, who are heavily invested monetarily (also emotionally). This ensures that Bitcoin will not completely die no matter what adversity befalls it. You may say it is "too big to fail"(ack) already. That is if many casuals lose interest, there will be a core of people who will keep it going.
However, his first point about Investment Instruments is a little bit weak. For one 600T turnover in derivatives doesn't mean there is actual 600T available to invest... If you and me churn some security worth 1Mil back and forth 1million times, we can generate 1T turnover but that doesn't we have more than 1Mil to invest.
As an investment for the big boys, Bitcoin still has a long way to go.
@_date: 2011-06-15 13:30:39
Agreed, established may be too strong a word. It's been, what two weeks in that range?
However, think about this, if someone bought in at $30, they are not going to sell at $25 unless they have some sort of huge emergency. My assumption is that people who are actually buying most of BTC for USD are buying them for the long haul ala Richard Falkvinge.
At current prices miners will be selling (some recent, some oldtimers) at $10+, less than that and they may consider hoarding. 
As for $30+ upper limit, as prices approach new highs, most daytraders will be tempted to take profits, once again enforcing this range. And some long term investors may also sell part of their holdings.
Once again, while there is no real external demand, BTC prices will tend to fluctuate (favorite quote of JP Morgan) in this range ($10-30).
In the absence of real demand, another factor which could drive the prices up would be the arrival of fresh speculators (aka greater fools) on the market. That may happen, but I wouldn't count on it.

I hadn't checked that Trade page for about 6 months and it has gotten much longer, that is good.
The bad: I randomly picked 3 vendors and got rather disappointing results:
Some VPN vendor: "not accepting Bitcoin until a new reliable API is implemented"
Some Beef Jerky vendor: e-mail us if you want to pay with Bitcoin...
Some Arcade Machine guy: Shopping cart is only in dollars, even though he helpfully explains what bitcoin is on his sidebar. How the heck do I pay in BTC for it?
Meanwhile, any warm enough body with a credit card can pay through Paypal(most Joe Average User do not care on how evil Paypal can be).
Someone show me an easy to pay with Bitcoins site:
Difficulty: BTC premium over regular currency not much higher than 10%, but I'll settle for any site which makes it ridiculously easy to use Bitcoin.
Any takers?

Point of currency without intrinsic value(which I consider bitcoin to be, alongside USD, Euros, etc)  is not "saving", point of currency is to act as "machine oil" to encourage trading of goods and services.
Just imagine if everyone saves 100% of their currency(Bitcoins, USD, Euros,whatever), economy basically is reduced to barter then.
This is the possible problem with bitcoin with the guaranteed deflation, people will have no incentive to use it, besides using it for bare necessities.
With inflationary currency, you have to do something with that money, else it loses value, you can't just burrow it in your backyard.

One answer is that the cost of mining will stop being profitable for those places where the cost of electricity is higher than average. Those miners will close up shops and mining rigs will migrate to low cost places.

EDIT2: not that anyone will see this post but I think I found a hard to beat winner (2 years ago):

Reason I asked this question is that I sort of vaguely remember hearing about a Bitcoin about a year ago or even before that.

USD is quite a bit(pardon the pun) more stable currency than BTC.
That said, I wouldn't want to hold $1000 under my mattress for 10 years, because with virtual certainty $1000 will buy me less in 10 years than now, while I wouldn't mind holding 50BTC encrypted in a few backups for  10 years.
Then again, the above tendency is precisely the problem with BTC, so far there is very little incentive to use BTC as a currency as opposed as investment/speculation.
@_date: 2011-06-07 12:09:07
There is no such thing as a sure thing. Currently, speculators are snapping up bitcoins being produced faster than they can be mined, thus the run up in price. However, we are still far away from mass acceptance of bitcoins for transactions.
Also, about that 140 year thing, that might be technically correct, BUT:
We'll have another 6.5 million bitcoins by 2015, and up to a total of 19million by 2021, the remaining 2 million will take a while, true. :)

This is the problem, at $0.20/KWH(what I am paying) you would be making hardly any money.
You would be pushing that max power draw of your card + CPU and peripherals, so figure at least 300W but more like 400W, most likely giving a net loss.

Think about this, who is going to buy bitcoin at $30+ ?
There is now an established trading range of let's say $10-30, where traders/speculators may operate.
However, to break the upper limit, you actually need some external demand.
External demand means,we need some service or good, which people would PREFER to buy with BTC not equivalent USD/Euro/gold.
Thus all these conversion services (BTC to Newegg, etc) do not count, because using BTC is worse deal, unless someone is already sitting on BTC.
Are there any services on  where using BTC is cheaper than say USD, provided you have neither but are holding Euros? Maybe some programmer is willing to work for 1BTC/h but the usual rate is $50/h? Maybe someone is selling Tshirts for $10 but only 0.25 BTC ? Those kind of things would drive BTC up.
The other option which could drive BTC growth would be providers which only deal with BTC, such as SilkRoad, and possibly some virtual gaming places (MMORPG, poker, etc).

You usually buy stocks in amounts evenly divisible by 100 (called *a lot*).
Odd-lotters (people who buy stocks in smaller amounts) usually pay a higher comission and it is harder to unload odd-lots.
A friend of mine recently got screwed when his 100 shares became 10 shares in a reverse stock split(Citibank), now it is much more expensive to sell them.

Hmm, 0.65% on each trade by MtGox, in the long run this should be a losing game, as more competing algorithms enter the market.
Pretty sure, regular HFA guys colocating near exchanges pay nowhere near 0.65% on each transaction (they have high fixed costs sure).

They actually do mean that old Radeon 7000 series, meaning that is truly a horrid graphics card.
The good news is that underlaying XCS3S4000 (which is 4miliion gate - 62208 logic element chip) shouldn't really be that expensive, various versions on Digikey are around $60-100, thus the finished board really could cost $200.
Only problem that they are all out of stock, but perhaps in China these rather old FPGA are freely available.
If they can really squeeze 300Mh/s out of these babies, then it might be an option for those of us, who pay for our own electricity.

Just wanted to add that gyft worked great for buying some amazon gift cards (which you can add to your Amazon account immediately). Gyft seems serious about Bitcoin, they actually read this subreddit.
If there is a negative to Gyft it is a philosophical one. They are using bitpay to process their payments. I am sure that is convenient, but you end up using three layers of indirection when you buy something on Amazon with BTC.

A few months ago when I checked some common CPU and M/Bs, bitcoinstore was more expensive than Amazon and Newegg, now I see their prices are quite competitive and often lower.
If you could figure out a way to ship out internationally, inexpensively, your sales would skyrocket. There is nothing close to Newegg in Europe.

We need to reach the stage where we do not have to worry about the constantly converting(mentally or actually)  BTC to say Euro or USD. 
Euro/USD fluctuate against each other, but the prices for the goods at the locale do not.
Currently, the goods that are priced in BTC are too tied down to regular currencies. 
For example, you want to buy a VPS hosting using BTC, the price in BTC will fluctuate, because the service provider needs to pay for the electricity, hardware, support in USD or Euro. We need to reach a stage where one could conceivable stay in BTC economy forever (just like people do with real money, if they do not travel).
