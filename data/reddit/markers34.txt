If you already have a channel open, transactions are instant no matter the amount. For a transaction to "happen" it doesn't need to settle on the blockchain. Since you can't cheat out of paying your part, once you get it on LN you can be sure it's payment done. Also moving small transactions to LN (along with a blocksize increase) will mean there is much less congestion. Less unconfirmed tx, smaller fees and faster on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:11:40
No, I meant transaction speed is what made it a problem for steam. Volatility is not a problem as long as transactions go through fast enough. When transactions started getting stuck, that's when it became a problem for steam because people were suddenly either not paying enough or paying too much by the time transaction went through. Of course, volatility is not desirable for something that is designed as a currency, but it's expected when it's this small. Volatility will decrease as tech/market matures and market cap grows.

What's the incentive to run a full bitcoin node? It's [too easy]( to run a lightning node, so competition will be very high. Most of the businesses will be running hubs as well, as they do full nodes, and likely won't charge much, if any, fees to make sure cheap routes are always available to and from their business.

You gotta pump up those numbers, those are rookie numbers!
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:01:29
Potential mischief is very costly for bad nodes. Nodes require a certain "deposit" locked up to work, and if a node tries to any type of fraud against you, you not only claim your own balance but also the node's deposit. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:24:46
Routing is still being worked out, but pretty much, yes. A very small amount of money, likely. But you don't need to do anything except having a small deposit locked up and being online, so it's safe to say we'll end up with more than enough nodes.

Thanks for the link. I didn't consider underpayment possibility, which is a real concern. But it wouldn't be a problem if transaction clears in time, so it's an indirect problem, not the root cause.

You don't understand. The tech is not the point. The censorship resistance is. Decentralization is. And you don't have decentralization if you rollback a transaction. You don't have decentralization if you have 21 BPs that represent the whole. Only Bitcoin is and have been truly decentralized until now. That's the whole point.

Technically has nothing to do with bitcoin, but other cryptocurrencies will be suitable for in-game transactions, both while providing value for the developer and the gamers. For example Kin has something called Kin Rewards Engine. They partnered with Unity, so game developers can easily integrate it into their game. Lets say gamers will earn and transact with Kins in their game. Depending on the transactional volume the game generates, the developer will get daily payouts from KRE.

USB key is not vulnerable to usb attacks since you only have it plugged in when Tails OS is in use. And even if it did, data is encrypted, with a decent password it takes 15+ years to crack. If they cracked the persistent volume and accessed data, you should have your wallet data encrypted with electrum as well, so add another 15 years for that. Bios malware can't do anything since private keys aren't exposed to outside world. You sign your transactions offline and memory is wiped when you shut down Tails OS. Nothing gets out.

Well, you did succeed at making me laugh.
What bitcoin has is one of the best communities (developer and supporter wise) and the most secure network in the world. If you don't want to pay 50-120 sat/byte as currently is, wait a couple months for developers to do their work, or just don't use it ever. Go use monero, litecoin or dying bcash like you said. (Don't know how exactly anyone uses bcash at this moment, but not my problem).  
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:45:07
Basically if someone (or a government) spends billions of dollars acquiring necessary ASICs to launch an attack on bitcoin network we would fire them, leaving them with unusable ASICs that are worth exactly 0$. Maybe the government can mine bcash if it survives that far :D We would also make history, since this would go down as one of the most stupid and expensive attempts at censorship.
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:09:31
Bitcoin is a revolutionary piece of tech with hundreds of developers behind it. You expected world domination from get-go where everything works and scales perfectly? I'm a programmer and it's clear you have no idea what you are talking about. If you don't like the speed of this revolution, go use bcash, dogecoin, paypal or whatever else. No one is expecting you to be part.  
Also, transactions with 120 sat/byte are going through just fine (in the next block) at the moment. Taking data from during 1-2 days of spam attacks and talking about it like it's usual case of bitcoin is not only retarded, it's dishonest and misleading.

Why are you so easily manipulated? By the way the quotes I've made aren't hyperlinked anywhere. They're just delusions of a random guy. Just think for a second. Segwit enables confidential transaction capabilities. If anything, if someone wants to spy on users they would be supporting big blocks. Can you not see simple things like this?

Not really. Having a lot of open channels doesn't give the company any extra control. r/btc FUD usually goes like this ".. and then banks will ask you for KYC..." which is retarded. If anyone asks you for kyc to go through their channel, you'll just close it and get your money back. After that, no one will use that channel, it's really simple.

No. The RSK platform uses Bitcoin as its native currency. A 2-Way Peg between Bitcoin blockchain and RSK blockchain ensures a fixed conversion between BTC and SBTC. (1 SBTC = 1 BTC).

Jokes on you, I have bitcoin since $400, I already recouped my investment, everything is profit to me now. I'm not some newcomer who sees the price increase. I'm an engineer, I see software. And software is eating the world.


Are you not reading my message? Transaction count is artificially limited. It couldn't have gone up because the limit has been reached more than 6 months ago. We're in process of fixing that.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:23:08


What makes you think this is supposed to be true? Base layer fees will remain affordable, and inside channel fees will be much much cheaper. Miners don't need to be paid 20 bitcoins per block when bitcoin is $100k or $1m. They will have to do with 1 btc per block, for example.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:56:18


Or, you know, you can wait a couple hours and open as much channels as you want. Also blocksize will eventually be increased, so no need to panic for nothing.

Segwit alone only causes a mild increase in transaction output. Also activation is at 14% currently, so you can't expect huge effect right off the bat. Why is segwit + 2nd layer better than big blocks? It's simple. Big blocks don't work. I can explain this to you in lenght, but someone already did it better so i'll [refer you there]( Watch the first 5 minutes, and tell me, which solution has the potential to make bitcoin dominate the world?

Because of network effect that supports the value, biggest of money always wins. Just like USD is winning right now. Other coins are irrelevant, because without the user base they're at significant disadvantage and difference gets bigger and bigger.  


It appears you haven't been following the scene and technical improvements bitcoin is going through. In that time frame daily transaction count couldn't have gone up, because there is some limits in the code that limits transactions that can go through to about 4 transactions per second. This limit has been reached quite a while ago, but we're about to deploy second layer solutions which means instant and free transactions, and pretty much unlimited scalability. Let's see how many transactions really happen when artificial limits aren't a barrier.

That site tells you to overpay all the time. I suggest [this]( As a thumb of rule a block clears 2000 transactions, so whichever fee bracket that has less than 2000 tx in total will be cleared. For example get your mouse at the end of the graph and you'll see there is 1.6k 30+ sat/byte tx, it means anything paying over 30 will be cleared in the next block. (Unless a sudden rush of transactions come in, you can overpay a bit to be safe)
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:23:34
So idiots exist. $350k is just a number for comparison. $1m bitcoin would put market cap at $21T. Total worth of all money is $90T IIRC. So is $1m bitcoin possible? Who the fuck knows. For the technology and what it enables, is $125bn undervalued? I'm a computer scientist, and in my opinion, yes.

Some people do that, yes. But people speculate on everything including rice prices, so that's not a huge suprise. Bitcoin is more like a gold 2.0 in that sense. There is a limited amount, it's easily transferable, easy to store, impossible to seize and it won't inflate. It's so easy and cheap to transfer you can use it like cash. It's limited in number so you can use it to store your wealth. When you buy some bitcoins it gives you the ability to send those bitcoins anywhere in the world for a very small fee. (For example one of the biggest transactions on the network was moving $150m worth of bitcoins. Sender paid zero fee. Free.) You can spend it, send it to your family across the world, or just keep it as hedge against inflationary nature of fiat currencies. Also because of properties of money, more people that use it, more valuable it is. And exponentially increasing number of people are using it, so people who believe it will be part of future financial system in a big way, buy/mine it, use it and keep it. Bitcoin's promise is not that its value will increase. Its promise is being a borderless value transfer system without any third parties. Open to everyone. Can't be censored. Value increase is just a side effect of more people realizing the benefits and starting to use it. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:33:04

Fees won't become too high because bitcoin price is increasing. People won't magically start paying 10x fees just because USD value went up, fee market is dynamic, people would just adjust 10x less satoshis and pay the same usd fee.

There can't really be super nodes. Keeping a channel open for a long time won't require too many coins, definitely not so much that only banks or rich people can do it. How LN keeps decentralization is there will be many hubs and many routes for any single transaction. A hub can't really ask you to go through KYC. The system is still pseudonymous. You can't ask a bitcoin address to identify itself. If you somehow try to match addresses from exchanges or such, simply no one will use your hub. You aren't sitting in the middle of transactions. There are many alternative ways around you, so if you try to KYC people or blacklist transactions, people will just tell you to go fuck yourself and not use your hub. Once a transaction is going through your hub, if you ask people for identification or other bullshit, that's fraud in LN. That person will not only get his money back, but also hub's own money because they tried to defraud him. It's better explained [here](

No. That's the whole point. Base layer will still be relatively cheap, because most transactions will happen on other layers. Also blocksize won't stay 1 MB forever, we'll expand it enough so everyone can open and close channels without paying insane fees. Last months 5-10 sat/byte fees have gone through regularly, so your concern about fees being too expensive to use isn't reasonable. It won't be so.

It's easy to create lightning nodes/hubs, so there will be many of them. Also lightning is mostly designed for small transactions. Would you really give enough fucks to care if someone asked you for kyc while trying to buy coffee? No, you would just say fuck off and use another route. It's so stupid, I don't even know where this kyc bullshit came from, but it makes literally no sense for anyone to try something like this. If a country starts requiring kyc for transactions on lightning hubs (makes no sense, there is no point tracking coffee purchases), people would just set up and use lightning hubs in other countries.

I've been following this situation develop for a while. Here is my 2 cents:  
* It's most likely that there is no wrongdoing about Tethers. Bitfinex is a huge ass, profitable company. They have over $1.3bn worth of bitcoin in their cold storage right now. If they decided to do fraud, they would simply steal the assets. If they are defrauding people by creating fake usd tokens, that's a shitload of added crimes and a lot of people will go to jail. Tether's [whitepaper]( clearly explains how it works. 
* Tether is **not** specifically used to pump bitcoin prices. There is no proof of this what-so-ever. Tether is traded against most major cryptocurrencies. Issuance of tethers both coincide with drops and increases in bitcoin price. If it was fake money that was going straight into the market to buy btc, we would see green candles every single time, which is not the case.
* Tether's market cap is pretty small, about $600m at the time of writing this. Last 24h trading volume of BTC was $3.2bn, $200m of them being against USDT. (6.25% of daily volume)  
  
There has been a single person that was spreading most of the FUD around bitfinex and tether (Someone that goes by the nick Bitfinex'd) and he's been going around with this stuff for months. I can only assume there is a malicious intent here, most likely scaring the bitcoin investors into switching to altcoins. I only assume this because FUD is never just about tether and bitfinex, but also about how it's used to keep BTC price high, which is obscene. Tether has $600m market cap and bitcoin market cap increased by $35bn in the last months alone. It's simply impossible to effect the price this much, even if you assume all tethers are fradulent and has no real value.  
Edit: I made [a post]( pointing out with numbers why price of bitcoin is not artificially inflated. Upvotes are appreciated for visibility!

Actual functional utility of the currency is what will win the day.  
Bitcoin isn't myspace.

You can say bitcoin started as myspace and it's becoming facebook if you want to use that metaphor.  


Network effect has nothing to do with speculators. Why exactly are people speculating on bitcoin? Because more and more people are using it, CME is planning on launching a futures market in it, and it has actual use as an emerging asset class. This isn't baseball cards, and you simply don't realize the value of this asset. Other people do. Stay on the sidelines and watch.

A few big shorts won't cut it when daily volume exceeds $8bn at times. You seem to be assuming bitcoin has no real value. Governments are way past "trivial to kill it" phase. So much is built on bitcoin you lose companies that are worth billions and others that will be worth billions if you over-regulate. Did you see what happened with Bitlicense in NY? Governments have no winning play here. They could have killed it, but it's too late now to make that move. It would hurt more than it would help. Maybe I'm too optimistic because I never paid for any bitcoins. Just a bit of freelance work years ago and good trades on the market. We'll see how it ends up, I have nothing to lose and a lot to gain.

Btc is btc wherever it is. If it's $11k worth tomorrow, it won't matter if it's on coinbase or your own wallet. If you mean trading, I don't recommend that. You can easily lose much more than you can win. If coinbase is holding your keys for you (keeping btc in coinbase wallet) there are many bad things that can happen. They can get hacked, they can go bankrupt, your account can get hacked, somehow regulatory changes make you unable to withdraw etc. A lot of cases where you lose your btc, and unlikely as it may seem, it happened many times to huge exchanges before. So it's the best to keep it in your own wallet.

A hardfork that broke consensus rules.

Breadwallet is good for mobile. Electrum on Android is also good. You would need to withdraw from your coinbase to your wallet. It's really easy, you'll get a receiving address once you have the wallet set up on your phone. You'll make a withdraw request from coinbase to that address, and you'll have full custody of your bitcoins in no time! They won't be on coinbase anymore, they will be on your phone. If you buy more on coinbase, you'll make more withdrawals to your wallet. Remember to properly back up seed phrase on a piece of paper. If your phone is broken or otherwise lost, you'll use those words to recover your wallet. Anyone who has the words can steal your funds, so never type them on a computer and never show/share them with anyone. Not stupid questions at all :)

Also do you realize ebay, amazon and many successful companies came out of the dot-com bubble? There is a small bubble around shitcoins that are copying bitcoin (or that otherwise have inflated valuations), but trust me, the valuation of bitcoin itself is just at the starting phase at $70bn.

You are thinking of centralized servers, where transactions are only processed once. On the blockchain, each and every transaction has to be processed by all nodes in the network. They are also saved in the immutable ledger, which keeps growing. Processing 4471 tx requires a 1.57 GB blocksize, that is created and propogated through all nodes, every 10 minutes. Technical limitations are clear. Without any 2nd layer solutions, bitcoin can't scale like this. It might be possible if we let specialized hardware become nodes, but this puts an end to decentralized and trustless nature of bitcoin. Just imagine government seizing all running bitcoin nodes at the same time, for example. I would suggest you do some reading on technical aspects of bitcoin, as you seem to be out of the loop.

simply doesn't understand variance in utility of these tokens. How that works is company creates a token and initial distribution of the token is used to further fund the project. Without an initial pricing, token value will be essentially zero at the beginning, so the project wouldn't take off because no one will want the token. Lets say you start dropbox competitor using blockchain. (Siacoin and Storj currently). You want to pay people who provide storage service with a coin. If the coin doesn't have any initial value, who will provide the space? No one. Because no one provides space, no one can buy space, so project is dead. Now imagine tokens are sold at 10 cents at the beginning. This gives the company enough funds to start operating and further develop the project. If project takes off, people will start using the project and therefore use the tokens. Because tokens are scarce (Only a limited number available, and can be verified with blockchain) more demand means a higher price for each token. You can say why do we need tokens for each project, then, why not just use eth or btc? Well, I agree there. If only use of token is to pay for the service, I would say token shouldn't exist at all. If you check out the best projects, the tokens always have another utility that makes it valuable. In case of ethereum, you need ether to run smart contracts on ethereum blockchain. In case of 0x (ZRX), tokens are used for governance of the open protocol and for people to pay fees to relayers. A lot of uses can exist for tokens that are beneficial to everyone involved.

Trezor doesn't send back the signal back to the computer. Hardware button press means trezor will sign the transaction and send back the signed transaction back to the trezor bridge, from where it's broadcasted to the internet. The device is expecting a hardware signal and only a hardware signal at that point. Without pushing a custom firmware, you can't emulate that signal. It would be quite a bit of work doing that on random hardware that runs on untrusted software, it's basically impossible doing it on a secure chip that only runs signed firmware that is designed to be airgapped.

Well, don't commit tax fraud, then. What does that have anything to do with bitcoins usability?
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:59:37
Depends on the device. For most efficient devices like Antminer S9? Yes. It is profitable *today*. If it keeps being profitable until you break even, you will make profit. If the price falls, difficulty increases or a combination of these two make it that your device becomes not efficient enough to be profitable, then you either wait until it's profitable again (might be impossible because new devices will always be more efficient if you don't upgrade) or you sell your device. As you see, it's a risk. Is it worth it? I would say not. Buying and holding bitcoin is much safer in the long run.

We'll think about it when it becomes a problem, that is the mindset that codes in EDA. How is it working out?


And if there isn't enough demand bitcoin becomes insecure and likely dies. Good plan.


An efficient market needs an amount of supply we will decide with hard forks. Or a supply that arbitrarily increases. You serious? All your points are moot.

They can mine that all they want now, but S2X is dead in the water. It isn't needed anyway, transactions are already cheap and fast, and will only get better thanks to segwit.

@_date: 2018-03-09 22:16:24
Well, think about this. Your monitor has a basic hardware button that once you press, it turns on, right? It's very simple. Now think how could you possibly turn the monitor on without pressing that button. Unless there is an interface in the software that allows you, it would be very hard to fake that signal. Now imagine how everything is specifically designed that only way to turn on the monitor is through the hardware. The software is literally is designed that there is nothing that interfaces to that function. On trezor, only way private keys are used are for signing transactions, and only way to sign a transaction goes through that button. If you want to send a "fake signal", the only way you can even come close to doing that is by modifying firmware that runs on the device, which is very tightly controlled against any modifications. Hardware wallets are by no means 100% secure. But it's secure enough that attempting attacks are very time consuming and are very limited (most require physical access to the device and a lot of time). When 99% of coins are stored on hot wallets, it becomes impractical to attack.

You can't use your bitcoin before updating, dead addresses don't need to upgrade since the coins are destroyed. Long-term-cold-storage addresses can update whenever they want. There is no urgency for upgrading. Yes, changing addresses would be big, but compared to bitcoin dying, it's not an issue.

My solution does address destroyed coins issue. Legacy private keys can only sign a transaction that send the coins to new upgraded address, nowhere else. So satoshi's bitcoins can be sent to his new, upgraded public address ONLY. Still only satoshi can access it, albeit with his new private key, that will be derived from his legacy private key. This may never become an issue, and if it does, it won't end bitcoin. You're just concerned over nothing, when we have more pressing issues. What is the point?

No, difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, usually 2 weeks with 10 minutes of average blocktime. Because the lost hashrate will slow block production rate, it will take more time for difficulty to adjust. Lets say adjustment just happened, and 50% of hashrate instantly goes offline. It would take 20 minutes for average block to come out, and adjustment would take 4 weeks. Lets say we're halfway to adjustment, and 50% of hashrate goes offline. Hashrate was supposed to adjust in a week (1008 more blocks, 1 week) but because blocks are produced slower, it would take 2 weeks to adjust. When it adjusts, however, blocks were in average produced every 15 minutes for the last 2016 blocks, so it would adjust downwards 50% (You need 100% downward adjustment if 50% of hashrate is gone), and adjust more after 2016 blocks.

Those limitations are easily overcome if you have the resources (a botnet to make requests, for example) and time.

Quite easy, because they have hundreds of requests every day, it happens all the time! See [this]( for some more explanation

Small blocks mean increased fees, BUT it's a small block, so transactions you can include are limited. Big blocks lower the average fee, but you include tons of transactions and make more profit. This is until LN and 2nd layer moves most small tx off-chain, requiring only on-chain settlement. Now that means the tx fee miners would have requested is gone. You just bought coffee and paid 0 fee with instant settlement thanks to segwit, if we didn't have segwit you HAD TO pay to the miners. This is why bitmain came up with Bitcoin ABC (original name of bitcoin cash), and tried to block segwit with all they have. They wanted every single transaction to go through them, to reap the benefits. Only UASF stopped that, before UASF they didn't agree to Segwit2x. After it was apparent they can't block segwit, they changed narrative to say "Segwit2x saved the day" which isn't true at all. Reality is, 2x is a rushed hard fork and we may not need it at all depending on how segwit adoption goes.

Support is 20% for Segwit2x, 15% against, [currently]( Do you seriously argue this is enough to move on with an important protocol change, one that will split the network, create confusion and possibly inflict irrecoverable damage to users trust?
@_date: 2017-09-30 14:46:32
They're saying they're working on the original chain only, and haven't yet decided to implement S2X. If they do implement S2X, it will be as an altcoin support, not replacing the original chain. The wording is weird, but "In case we support it" and "the ones not accepting it, *the fork*, will be able to use the wallet" alone are enough.

I'm not against a blocksize increase, but it is simply not needed right now while we see effects of segwit adoption. 1 MB blocksize also gives incentive for people to use and adopt segwit and 2nd layer solutions. If we gave people enough room to settle on-chain for everything, then this could become an endless cycle where we keep postponing the 2nd layer solutions, leading to an endless growing blockchain. With actors working to their own benefit (miners) indefinitely trying to delay these solutions, this would go on forever. UASF stopped just that, an endless attack by the miners to stop 2nd layer scaling. Thank god we did, it might have been too late if they were given even a bit of leeway. They have connections and billion dollars in cash, and they still have failed. This shows bitcoin's resilience to censorship and central entities trying to control the direction it goes.

Miners already do cash out to fiat. They're big business, gotta pay the bills. Chinese miners are definitely not 80% of network. The thing is people who would sell at a miner ban already sold at the exchange ban. I'm not saying an immediate increase (in short term a small correction downwards might happen) buy in the long term banning of Chinese miners brings more much needed decentralization to mining, which is good. I have no clue either, no one does, really. We're just speculating based on experience with the markets. It's just physology, after all.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:15:25


Nope. If miners decided what bitcoin is, would we have segwit? They don't have power for shit. Economic consensus decides what real bitcoin is. Users, businesses, and miners all together. Not whoever is rich enough to buy a lot of hardware.

Well, as long as there are people willing to pay a fee yes, those fees will be collected by the miners. Free market decides the fees, not the miners, so if everyone simply stopped paying fees or there was enough space in blocks to do so, you could send free transactions. I didn't pay fee for most of my transactions when I first got into bitcoin, for example.

Big blocks are more profitable for miners. Small blocks usually mean increased fees (If you don't have segwit and 2nd layer, which we are adopting) but the increase in fees is nothing compared to having big blocks so everything is on-chain. Bitcoin cash (Originally named Bitcoin ABC) is a project by billion dollar mining company, Bitmain. They somehow pushed their own agenda as "Satoshi's original vision" and some people appear to have eaten it up. All they want is more profits. They wanted more profits on the original bitcoin, but when their tactics have failed to block segwit, they made the contentious hard fork of bitcoin cash, in an attempt to take over with the rules they wish (The rules that make them more profit).

Blockchain like data structure didn't exist before blockchain, no one solved byzantine fault tolerance problem so a trustless distributed database simply didn't exist.

1- Corporations don't work that way  
2- Google doesn't have ASICs, anything but ASICs is peanuts in this hash rate war  
3- Hash rate doesn't mean adoption. Just because a coin has more hash rate doesn't make it bitcoin. Economical consensus (users, businesses and miners all together) define what bitcoin is. Just because you forked off and had enough money to throw hash rate on your coin doesn't mean anyone will use it, you will simply waste a lot of electricity before shutting down because you can't pay the power bill.

It also reduces supply at exchanges. What kind of logic is this?
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:21:01
Obviously, yes, but not to an amount where it effects centralization. Or an amount that requires datacenters to run a node. With lightning network we get best of the both worlds. For small transactions (buying coffee for example) send a LN transaction. Instant and free. For big amounts, go for direct on-chain settlement. 10 minute confirmation, and still extremely cheap compared to legacy banking system. Win-win.

I agree some tokens are useless, but obviously not all of them like you claim. Let me give you an example. In 0x project, a decentralized protocol for exchanging ERC-20 tokens are being built. It's open source and free to use. ZRX is used by people to pay fees to relayers (Decentralized exchanges built on 0x protocol) AND governance of the protocol. As more relayers are built, protocol needs to be upgraded but how can you do this without a central control when a lot of things will be built on it in the coming years, and not every interest will be aligned with each upgrade? The answer: ZRX token. Now tell me how they could achieve this if they didn't have a token at all?

Except that didn't stop online gambling, it just moved the money flow to somewhere they can't control and tax. For example, bitcoin. If what you said happens US would lose all of its ability to control and tax bitcoin. China did exactly that, closing down all exchanges. People moved to OTC buying and selling, no one stopped using bitcoin. Venezuela tried outlawing bitcoin, and in turn, usage increased. If you try to stop bitcoin it hurts you the most. Even if US somehow stopped their citizens from buying and selling bitcoin, that hardly effects bitcoin. 1 year before China ban %80 something of BTC trades were happening over CNY. What happened after the ban? After a small slump price hit ATH after ATH, market mostly moving to JPY. You see, it can't really be stopped.

You import your public key in your regular, internet connected OS, on electrum. This let's you see your wallet, create receiving addresses and receive money, but doesn't let you send anything because priva key isn't here. What you do is you create a transaction, save is to an usb file, boot up the tails, sign the transaction offline, copy it back to usb and broadcast it online when you go back to your regular OS. Yes, a lot of work, but if you are in need of cold storage that also can also send transactions, pretty much only option besides HW.

No, brute forcing a private key of a specific address would take millions of years. If it was possible, bitcoin would be broken and worthless. Only so many combinations are available when you alter the private key, so it is not safe. If you alter every character, with no pattern, I guess it could work, but what's the point then?

Well, wonder no more. Trezor is safe because it doesn't let you export your private key. Unless you decide to write your seed words on a computer (never do that), your private keys will never touch the internet. When you sign a transaction, the transaction moves to your hardware wallet, it requires a physical confirmation before signing the transaction and signed transaction moves back to the computer and broadcasted to the internet.

@_date: 2017-09-07 19:22:07
They will not. Once you give the miners ability to chose, they will always chose profits over benefit of the network in the long term. Why would they ever implement 2nd layer, when just keep increasing the blocksize = more profits? Who cares you don't have instant transactions or can't pay coffee with your bitcoin, they will be printing money. This is basically the idea of BCH. Miners make the profit, miners don't care about bitcoin. They don't give a shit about your ability to make micro payments, or that bitcoin will become centralized, they are making money and that's all that matters to them.

@_date: 2017-10-26 14:34:29
Hello there! Good questions, they're similar concerns I had once I started researching more about bitcoin. Let me address them.  
1- This isn't a big issue, because of some reasons. First, bitcoin is not anonymous, it's pseudonymous. It's actually much more trackable than cash because all transactions are recorded on the public ledger and once your identity is tied to your address, a lot of your transactions can be tied to your identity. This is how they caught a lot of dealers on Silk Road. To obtain large sums of bitcoin, you'll need to go through exchanges, which all have identity checking before they let you transact. About federal reserve banning bitcoin once it becomes mainstream: It's already mainstream. People have millions and some have billions stored as wealth in bitcoin. Also, how do you exactly make bitcoin illegal? It's not and can't possibly be made illegal to memorize some words, which is basically what a bitcoin wallet is. Just a private key. Owning bitcoin can't possibly be made illegal for this very reason, and if they tried, they couldn't enforce such a ban. Another reason is, bitcoin isn't just a currency. With bitcoin comes innovation, new companies, cash flow and disruption of industries. This is what Silicon Valley is all about, and what made California one of the biggest economies in the world. If you ban bitcoin, or restrict it's use with strict laws, one thing will happen. Innovation leaves your country. Companies that were built on your country, that was generating tax for you and jobs for your citizens, gone to never be back again. Look at what happened with [Bitlicense in New York]( New york was on it's way to become one of the hottest blockchain start up hubs, and with one swift move (Too much regulation), everything is gone. Companies worth billions packed their bags and went somewhere where they are free to innovate. Is this what countries want to become? If not, they won't ban bitcoin. And if they do, other countries will be waiting with open arms.  
2- I am a computer engineer. The amazing thing about blockchain is, you don't need to trust it. Incentive system of bitcoin is set up such in a way that you need billions of dollars in hardware to attack the system, and if you ended up doing that, all you would be able to do is reverse some of the payments you made. If you're in that situation, you would do much better playing honest and securing the network, which pays you to do so. Development-wise, soft forks can only tighten the rules, not other way around. No soft fork can create rules that will hurt bitcoin economy in any way. Any hard fork that can hurt bitcoin economy will be ignored by the community, making it a non issue. You're saying what would happen if more than %50 of the bitcoin economy came together to hurt bitcoin? Why would anyone that is part of bitcoin economy would want to do that, let alone 50%? And even then, how exactly can they do it? There is really not much they can do. Best they can do is hard fork away with their 50% and divide the community, which would hurt them most. You can't wake up one morning and find blockchain gone. It doesn't rely on anyone to exist, as long as there is a miner, blockchain will go on. And if there is no miners left, you start mining, and it still goes on. But what if tomorrow you wake up and we're in the middle of another economic crisis because of banks fuck up? Which one is more likely? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:28:01
You can't mine 1 BTC. Current block reward is 12.5 BTC, so you can mine that plus transaction fees for that block. The probability is incredibly low though because of competition, which is why you join mining pools where reward is shared when a block is found. That machine mines around $10 of btc/day currently, if I remember correctly.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:01:48

Exchange volume doesn't mean much, besides that people like to gamble. On chain transaction count shows actual usage, which for bch, is almost non existent. No one is using it. To give you an idea, on bch chain, between blocks [493930]( and [493931]( there is 9 minutes. Only 54 transactions happened during this time frame. Main chain blocks average at 2000 transactions on same 10 minute time frame. Bch has roughly 0.27% on chain transactions (usage) of bitcoin.

That's not how bitcoin works. Consensus rules are enforced by full nodes, not miners. If they don't follow the rules, their blocks will be orphaned and they will have wasted electricity on nothing. And yes, even after having 51% of the hash rate this doesn't change.

That's the whole point of cryptos. If a government creates a cryptocurrency it's no different than fiat, since they will be controlling the money supply. (E.g. print whatever they want). A big bank can't create a cryptocurrency, that would be very illegal, as they would be basically printing money. Which government would allow that? Here comes the decentralization. Permisionless innovation, everyone can use it but no one is responsible. Completely transparent and fair. I suggest you check out [this talk]( transparent and trustless systems take a lot of power away from governments.

We're well on track for his vision, and i'm proud to be part of it by explaining it to people like you.

Oh yeah, the infamous altcoin trap. It took me a couple months to realize the same thing, you need very strong reasons to think an altcoin will outperform btc if you are buying. Nothing is cheap if you're buying with bitcoins. Ever since then I've been doing my research like crazy, skipping almost everything. I've been staying away from BCH like plague because it has no use.

Utility tokens increase in value because of network effect, so even though legally it's not an investment, you can expect returns if project takes off. I'm not arguing most ICOs are vaporware or outright scam, but tokens are becoming a new asset class, and arguing *all* of them are scam and useless is absurd.

Holding bitcoin enables you to make worldwide money transfers (almost instantly), p2p and in a trustless fashion for a fraction of the cost of going through the legacy banking system.

You bet there is. You see this shit? This is with 3-4 tx/sec. Bitcoin is pretty much unusable at the moment for payment purposes. 2017 was a big year for bitcoin, because of segwit. Segwit fixes transaction malleability, making lightning network and other 2nd layer solutions possible. Lightning network means bitcoin becoming almost infinitely scalable. Instant transactions. No fees. Cross atomic swaps with other blockchains that will make away with centralized exchanges and enable trustless trading. Micro transactions, making payments on the order of 1/10 of a cent possible. IOT devices paying each other, people using bitcoin every day to buy coffee or a house. Big retailers and tech companies implementing bitcoin (think amazon, google) because they finally can. Future is bright.

There is no hash power yet because HF didn't happen. Simply some miners are "signaling" support for S2X with the blocks they mine. This doesn't mean they will instantly switch and stay with S2X chain. Some bitcoin cash pools are signaling NYA, goes to show it doesn't mean much, really.

If your bank account password is stolen, your money will be gone in split second as well. Credit card number is more similar to public key in that sense. The fact that it's immutable means you don't need to worry about such situation. That is exactly what immutable means. Buyer protection can be implemented by regular escrow systems. The most inefficient part of current payment systems is the transfer of money. Do you know how wide spread credit card fraud is? The reality is, most sellers get fucked repeatedly by credit card fraud, with no recourse. With bitcoin, seller doesn't need to be worried about fraud, which enables him to lower costs (lower fees and no middleman) and transact globally. Lower costs will drive up the competition and buyers will have cheaper prices to chose from. It enables unbanked people to become part of the economy and create value. This is the value of blockchain.

Yep. Also if you were to use a mining algo that is also used for other stuff (say, ai training) that opens a new pool of hashrate that might be used to take over the network at any time. A big enough company with enough computing power or a government might halt regular operations and use the extra hashrate to take over the network. This is also why ASICs actually improve the security of the network. GPUs are still useful and can be sold for their cost after a 51% attack. SHA-256 ASICs become a literal brick if trust in bitcoin network is destroyed.

1 - This is risky for the buyer, seller can just swipe the account after selling it.

Blockchain powers bitcoin but also has many other uses

It's open source. Thousands of eyes are looking at it (me included). If that's not secure enough for you, nothing is.
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:52:14
If it comes to that, I'll run 100 mining nodes spread around the world myself.  I can imagine a lot of people will follow suit.

That would be dreaming. It's insane he got as lucky as he was.
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:34:47
I think what he meant was they can take half the computational power used for search to mine bitcoin and spread out the rest. In theory this could result in %100 slower searches.

Hahah no, these are bitcoin debit card companies that are better than Xapo.

Have you ever seen a trezor numpad? Location of the keys are only visible on the trezor screen, and they're randomized each time. Computers screen only shows dots instead of actual numbers, so there is no way screen cap allows the attacker to see the pin.

Yeah absolutely. Who uses ethereum platform except for ICOs at the moment? Literally no one. It's experimental software and shouldn't be used for mission critical apps anyway, the developers said as much. $31bn for experimental software? Too much IMO.

Wasn't him. Someone compromised his email by re-registering it when it expired, and reset the password to the forum account that way.

If fee was the only concern, there are shitloads of cryptos with zero fees.

Depends. If you bought something that does nothing, you get nothing. If you bought a utility token that will be used on their network, you get that. When VC firms are throwing hundreds of millions to grab some of these tokens, saying all of them are worthless scams is a bit ridiculous.

The thing over there is they become kind of delusional. They support 2X because they want bitcoin disrupted and failed. For some reason they think bch will get most hash rate after 2x fork, for which there is literally no possible explanation. It's kind of sad.

Having no privacy is, indeed, easy. Go ahead, post your name and bitcoin address for everyone to see. Nobody else wants that, though.

It would get liquidated the moment he can't cover the position. The amount you need to post as collateral depends on your leverage, for example if you short with 10x leverage you're effected by price moves 10x. You can have $100 in your account and short/long margin upwards of $100x10 = $1000, but the moment market moves up/down %10 against you, you will be liquidated. You can post $200 collateral and leverage at 5x, in that case you wouldn't get liquidated before it moves 20%. You can keep adding money to your account to avoid liquidation (before it happens) but you'll keep losing if the market doesn't turn around. How does this affect the market? Well, if there is a difference between different markets (even futures) people will arbitrage the difference and the gap will close. If bitmex futures price suddenly goes up $1000, people and bots will instantly start buying on other exchanges (and some shorting in bitmex) and the difference is their profit.

You can get liquidated before the contract expires. Your contract will pass on to the new owner.

Yep, they lost $10m divided by whatever leverage they used.

%12? That's absurd. Stop using them and start using localbitcoins.com IMO. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 20:41:27


That would be extremely illegal. I don't know why this is such a common myth, I've seen it repeated for several exchanges so far.

You don't need confirmations.
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:30:38
That makes no sense. There is no need to find excuses for our congested network, there is need to find and apply solutions. Bitcoin isn't here to compete with some aspects of traditional banking, it's here to completely crush it.

Hahah of course. You can invest in 1 USD cents in btc if you wanted to (Not advisable because of network fees, though)

I laughed. You don't understand bitcoin. It's okay, for a long time people didn't understand internet either. All in due time.

Cmon, this is too obvious. He threw people off the track, because he knew eventually people will dig in and look for him. He did everything to be anonymous, but slips his initials? Makes zero sense.
