This sucks 
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:30:58
Or an UAHF in this case:p

Should really use Bech32 adresses if you want cheaper fees, they start with bc1

And maybe at the same time a variabel min_blocksize_limit should be put in to stop miners mining empty and small blocks.. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:45:19
What about an variable blocksize limit? That increase and decrease the blocksize after the size of mempool or amount of transactions in the last Block, or increasing it if none of the last 30blocks had any capacity left..? 
@_date: 2018-04-17 03:07:32
An easy example why is if one of each hundred blocks are empty fees will effectively be 1% higher than with full blocks..

Can signal for an UASF any miner can..
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:00:42
Has each node a different mempool? Is not the mempool the pool of unconfirmed transactions? 
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:06:20
But ok then it can look at the last 10-20 or so transactions and if all of them where 1000 of 1000 kb full, it raises the blocksize too 1200kb and if the next blocks still are full (1200/1200kb) it raises it furter too 1400kb Blocks(and so on) and when the network is less congested it lower the limit again in the same matter just smaller blocksizes.. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 09:58:06
That will not be an issue if both upper and lower limits are variable and set after certain requirements. Mempool size or unconfirmed transactions, if it is going down towards 0 the minimum goes to 0 if it goes up towards full blocks they expand..
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:18:03
Yes, but the min_blocksize_limit doesnt have too be a full Block, but at least 100kb or something fitting. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:52:29
And somehow stopping mining because it is No transactions isnt that bad of a idea that it sound like.. If you think about it ;) of course it would never be that way.. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:42:43
Still not that far a twat yet
@_date: 2018-04-17 03:38:01
Wow:) That could turn out to have a great effect for New people accepting Bitcoin!  
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:20:13
At this time of writing it is, but when the price doubles, 1btc are Split into twice as many transactions than before it doubles since it will be the same value, but same amount of btc and twice the amount of data.. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:31:56
We just need the majority of miners with us.. How do you think protocol changes are done to the network if not like this? 
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:50:35
It would need to be an Algorythm that meassure how much congestion is on the network and raise and limit the blocksize limits to protect the network from flooding as well as empty blocks..
Or it can be raised at a certain fee / byte or something like this.. Please come with better solutions so we can start implenting and develop them..
