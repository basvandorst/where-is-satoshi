Are you 100% sure about that? If their bank never responds (even if it takes months), isn't my money technically gone for good?
Thanks for the info!

I assumed they were trustworthy because I have a few friends who used them successfully. Had my money gone through, I would've quadrupled my investment (on Litecoins).
Guess I got f*$k3d???

LOL you're really funny man! Haha great joke!

No idea buddy, but good luck and keep me posted! I will too - hopefully they come through for us.

Dumb reply in so many ways. You make a moron look like a genius next to you.
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:23:37
Thank you peanut gallery.

Thousands of people are using OKPay with no problem. My friend used them and made about $100K profit so far. The only thing worthy of a Derp is you posting on my thread.

do you have a site with okpay horror stories? I have one for you if so.

Well said.
For all he knows, my house is paid and I drive a pretty nice car, and just work to keep up with regular expenses. 
Not only is Josh a bit naive and dumb, but it's none of his business what I do with my money anyways!

You're right - it's not ridiculous to assume. But you still shouldn't assume, because you seriously sound like an idiot. One reason why you're pathetic is because you saw this thread as an opportunity to pass judgement on someone as opposed to adding anything of value to the community. Think about that and hopefully it'll help you smarten up.

Of course people care. It may save someone the time &amp; pain of dealing with OKPay. Some of us care to share our misfortunes with the hope of helping others. That's one of the good things about the internet. One of the bad things is bored people posting very unhelpful replies like yours (and THAT'S what no one cares about).
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:26:23
I never said I was "suprised". Do you have any helpful questions or are you just bored?

Has anyone ever successfully gotten their money back from OKPay?
