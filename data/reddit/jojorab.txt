I don't understand the point of CoolWallet. People use hardware wallets because they think that their PC or smartphone can get compromised by malwares.
But if your mobile or PC is compromised, this product is totally useless! Malware just need to change the destination address and amount before sending the signing request to the CoolWallet. User will tap tap, transaction will be signed and boom bye bye your bitcoins.
False sense of security can bring catastrophic consequences. People will load their CoolWallet with hundreds of bitcoins, and malware will specifically target this product because of its high yield results.
I'm totally baffled by this epic fail of a "security product".

This is worst than I thought. 
I mean, this is not a school project right? You are actually selling yourself as Bitcoin and security specialists. How in the world can you write something like this? In public? The day you announce your product?

Well in this case, it was another epic fail.
Anyway, I guess it's a young team, a community project, and they are here to learn, so you are right I should show more patience than if it was a business venture.

You obviously haven't any idea of what you are doing. Your OTP doesn't make any sense in your process (why not just a button?).
You shouldn't be in the business of mission critical engineering. This can only end very badly.
At least consider hiring a security specialist. You may be good in hardware design, but security is a real science, not something you can improvise on the go.

Well, if your CEO can't even deal with PR directly at your stage this doesn't smell good. I can't believe one second you'd delegate such important work, especially on a crucial day like this one.
