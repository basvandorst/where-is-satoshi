People feel a need to rationalize and justify their bad decisions. By saying that its just a gamble and you got lucky, they are trying to convince themselves that they were right in not investing as well.

There is no risk. Just use bitpay. Accept bitcoins that get turned into dollars instantly upon purchase of item. If a return is needed, just refund the dollars or the equivalent in bitcoin if the customer prefers. Any fluctuation in the price of bitcoin in the meantime is not a risk to anyone but bitpay who is holding the bitcoins. If the customer gets less btc back because the price of bitcoin dropped, it's obviously not your fault. They can take the refund in dollars just as well.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:42:29
Something similar happened to me this morning. I tried to withdraw my bitcoins to bitfloor and the withdraw seemed to go though just like my previous withdraws. But as time passed, it never made it to the block chain. Half a day later, my MtGox balance still says zero, the withdrawal transaction is not in the blockchain, and the only evidence of the withdrawal is in my MtGox Account history. I emailed support but they will probably make me wait days before I get my bitcoins back. Definitely never using MtGox again, no matter what.
@_date: 2013-07-05 16:59:16
Because its too hard to buy right now. Bitinstant doesn't work and coinbase takes a week.

Nope. It's saying that grandma's investment was good. And I don't know of any bad ones. So based on what I know about grandma, she is a smart investor. Obviously more data would improve my confidence in my opinion of grandma. It's more fair to call this a good investment than to compare it to a winning lottery ticket. Lotteries are based on random chance. The price of bitcoin is not.

All this is assuming the price of BTC stays at $122.10/BTC, which will not happen. At just $130/BTC it's profitable by January, at $140/BTC, profitable by December, at $150/BTC, profitable by November, and so forth. If you are projecting difficulty increase, then it seems fair to also project price increase.
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:33:57
It is normal for people to rationalize their behavior. These people do not own bitcoin, so they are rationalizing it by bashing bitcoin despite not knowing anything about it. Don't stress over this. Don't try to convince these kinds of people. You can't force someone to be open-minded.

Millions of people are not tech-savvy enough to handle a service like coinbase with 2 factor authentication. These people would trust a bank to store their coins and perhaps have a kind of debit card to spend them. Again, these services would not be for people like us who clearly do not need them. Grandparents will want to use bitcoin. People who do not own a computer will want to own bitcoin. People who do not own a separate device to carry out 2 factor authentication will want to use bitcoin. And yes, I do know what banks do. In this scenario I describe, they would offer a contractual guarantee of security for bitcoins. Banks will not disappear. People will always need loans to buy things like houses and cars. Your view of bitcoin users is too narrow.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:43:49
That is correct. If you generated a private key to a wallet with btc in it, you would be able to spend it.

Currency is [something that is used as money]( Money is [something (such as coins or bills) used as a way to pay for goods and services and to pay people for their work]( Bitcoin is currency. Bitcoin is money. OP's opinion of how difficult it is to use Bitcoin does not change (or have anything to do with) the definition of currency.

The technologically literate will not use these services, but rather the people who want to participate in the bitcoin economy while still putting their trust and security concerns in an institution like a bank. Some people trust banks more than websites and wallet programs. Banks might offer insurance in case of theft up to a certain amount, for example.

MT.Gox screwed up a btc withdrawal I made this morning that never made it into the blockchain. They made my balance zero and added the transaction to my account history, but it never made it to the blockchain, so I don't have access to my bitcoins until they decide to give them back. Never using MT.Gox again.

Maybe. I think perhaps by then, these computations will be done faster and will not require such expensive machines or that much power consumption, so transaction fees become more significant since miners won't have such high costs.

Amazon would never "consult your firm" precisely to avoid people doing what you are pretending to do. Come on dude, Amazon can buy as many lawyers as they want.

These services would not be aimed at people like us. We are early adopters. We are technologically literate. Believe it or not, there are hundreds of millions of people on earth who are not as technologically literate as us, and their bitcoins would be in greater risk in their computers than in a bank.
