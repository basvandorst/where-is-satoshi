As someone who is also looking forward to being back at zero after 8 years of student debt - I'm really pleased for you! I'm just trying to imagine how much relief you feel :) 45 BTC would be enough to change my life and I feel a glimmer of excitement with each 0.1 BTC I achieve. Please make the most of it &amp; do the soul searching you always promised yourself!

I've had this happen with camera equipment. Even if they have withdrawn the cash, PayPal can still give you the money back, then their account will be in negative instead of yours. If you have proof of delivery with signature to the PayPal address then keep contacting PayPal to get it resolved. It's super frustrating but keep calm, give all the details you can &amp; be persistent. 
Remember the whole point of using a third party service like PayPal is for these type of situations. Good luck!

I would probably ask her how Bitcoin ( a currency) is not age appropriate. If you had written about earning dollars from washing the car that would have been accepted. 
The 0% represents her understanding of Bitcoin not your knowledge or effort.
I'm going to share your guide with my nephew. :)
I think everyone has a moment when they realise that teachers &amp; grades aren't what learning is all about. 
Mine was writing up an article on the printing press &amp; Johannes Gutenberg. I started with illuminated letters and I slowly transitioned to a standard type face to show the move towards movable metal type. 
I just got it back with a giant red tick all across it, that's when I realised I cared more than the teacher did. From then on I learned for enjoyment not grades.
