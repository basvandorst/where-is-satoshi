Seemingly everything is like it should be. bitcoin-cli running okay and I am on testnet. I will ask the eclair guys. Thank you very much for taking the time to help :)

Hi there, got pretty far with it but I am now facing another problem.
All commands starting with "eclair-cli" return the following error message:
 "curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8080: Connection refused"
The only reference to port8080 I found was in the /home/bitcoin/bin/eclair-cli file. URL='
I still don't quite know what to do with this. Any hint is appreciated
Additional info:
sudo systemctl status eclair.service returns the following:

Unfortunately I was not as lucky as TheGreatMuffin.
usernames and passwords match, checked them 10 times. 
I don't have the "" in bitcoin.conf, but in eclair.conf just like TheGreatMuffin.
restartet multiple times, waited but still no joy.
eclair.log states:
fatal error: could not connect to bitcoind using json-rpc

There are also a few altcoin TAs on my channel
Edit: just added "LineRider on BitcoinHistory" on my channel

Thank you everyone for the positive feedback. As a thankyou, I just uploaded "LineRider on Bitcoin Hisotry". Hope you enjoy.
