For those that haven't seen it there is a negative [NY Times article]( about Bitfinex, Tether and the recent subpoena.

One point I never see mentioned in the comparisons with gold. If you have a gold bar, you can easily cut small bits off it and pass them to someone else to buy something - even if there is no electricity / internet etc. All you need is to be able to weigh it.
In that way it is a store of value that is inherent to the object and robust to complete shutdown. Bitcoin doesn't seem like that to me at all. Although I know the blockchain is distributed, still it is a sort of centralised record. So you can only transact by getting it logged on the single distributed ledger. Two people in a cabin in the mountains with no power and no comms cannot exchange bitcoin, but they can exchange gold. Either power out *or* internet out would be enough to render bitcoin unexchangeable. 
Anyway, thats why they seem to me quite different.
