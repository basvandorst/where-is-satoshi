I have amazon digital gift card and apple store gift card. Do those work?
@_date: 2018-10-06 18:00:24
Im all for bitcoin but let someone say something negative and everyone shits on him/her.
That is the only thing that bothers me about reddit
@_date: 2018-10-06 21:00:54
Yeah im not really a fan of paper wallets. Had a few and pain in the ass.
Electrum is mobile?
I would love a mobile wallet. Much more convenient. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 01:07:07
I keep hearing and seeing localbitcoin but im a little suspicious.
Seems like there is no guarantee and if you lose money, oh well.
@_date: 2018-10-06 20:20:10
Wow...no sense of humor i see. Typical reddit-terian
@_date: 2018-10-09 02:15:39

Hello, 
I know i will probably get roasted for this because reddit community is so awesome and will ask why i have my bitcoin on an exchange.
I have some bitcoin that i would like to store on a desktop wallet or paper wallet.
What is the best option right now (fastest sync time, safest one from all These options with some
Knock offs)?
EDIT: r/bitcoin
@_date: 2018-10-07 01:26:10
So not custodial correct?
@_date: 2018-10-06 21:13:58
Thanks. Very helpful. 
When i got into crypto, all the articles I read mentioned seed and private key so i understand the importance of it and it is implanted in my brain forever.
@_date: 2018-10-06 20:20:48
I meant this sub. My bad.
@_date: 2018-10-06 23:31:57
Small amount
Is bread wallet custodial or non?
