This is awesome.
Can you share what the flyer looked like? (the outer envelope and the contents, sans private key)
Is the artwork available so others can re-use at other air drops?

Picture of government id, picture of you, cell phone that they text you a code, then you're good to buy bitcoins. I have used that one several times. 
They always charge 5% more than current market.
Initially, they would spit out a receipt for every transaction. Now they don't.
Every mall should have one. :-)

There are at least 2 bitcoin ATMs in Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington. Probably a few more... they're slowly helping to build the strata ecosystem that is required to get cryptocurrencies off the ground.

They (s5's) are also louder than the prior generations. I used to have some s3's in the living room and didn't have a problem with the fan noise. However, I have some s5's in a bedroom and I can hear it across the house.
