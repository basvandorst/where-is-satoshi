Your analogy is flawed. This is more like "The scammer is impersonating the bank teller inside the bank, but the bank is not doing anything about it"
This is a security issue on Coinbase side and they must fix to their website to prevent potential theft for other Coinbase customers. 
Cryptsy was at least proactive in fixing to this serious security issue by **displaying the generated Bitcoin address in TEXT FORMAT under the generated address so user can verify it before sending funds to it.**

Huge Apple fan here, but I actually never met anyone who used Apple Pay.
Bitcoin on the other hand is used by tons of people everyday... **[Over 100,000 Bitcoin transactions a day]( to be exact.

Upon further investigation, it looks like it was a chrome extension for BTC price that changed the address displayed on my Coinbase account.
I informed Coinbase support, but they still don't care. I'm pretty sure lot of people will lose lot of money because of this lack of security on Coinbase.

You're only thinking from a consumer perspective.
From a merchant perspective; MasterCard has 3% fees, Bitcoin has 0% fees.
The capitalistic greed of merchants will eventually boost Bitcoin acceptance through discounted prices for Bitcoin shoppers.

r/Bitcoin is my last hope to share the grievance of my story, hopefully Coinbase listens...

Discounted prices for Bitcoin shoppers is a much bigger incentive to people than all those Visa &amp; MC incentives you mentioned.
The capitalistic greed of merchants looking to avoid Visa &amp; MC's 3% fees, will eventually boost Bitcoin acceptance.

This is the address that was on my Coinbase account:
The screen that has my receive addresses shows other addresses, but not his one.

I sent the 10 BTC to the SAME EXACT address on my Coinbase account, you can compare yourself here:
Edit: I use 2FA on my Coinbase account.

Most merchants take Bitcoin to avoid Visa/MC 3% fees, not because customers demand Bitcoin.
Circle &amp; Coinbase are far from devilishly complicated contraptions.
Most people will use Bitcoin to get that 2% discount on a $2000 laptop or flat screen TV. Would you leave $40 on the table ?

I meant a image format or whatever Cryptsy is using. It's kinda like a Captcha verification. It's very simple, yet it's very effective.
Everybody uses browser extensions, so Coinbase must address this security issue on their site since they claim to have "Bank Level" security... I'm out of 10 BTC mainly because of this lack of security on their side.

It's not hard to see... Bitcoin makes international shopping safer, which means more shipping for UPS.
Until more US merchants accepts Bitcoin, I use  which is a package forwarding service that accepts Bitcoin. Viabox gives you a free US mailbox to shop at any US store, then they use shipping carriers like UPS, Fedex, DHL, etc... to forward packages to customers in other countries.
