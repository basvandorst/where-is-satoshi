That sounds a bit biased to me. Bitcoin also has the "downside" of being untraceable, which makes it easy to use for fraudulent purposes, like cash. And cash is actually being modified for this exact reason (printing more of the small bills and less of the big ones). So why wouldn't politics go against bitcoin for the same reason?
I'm not trying to stir up a debate here but just making a point: it seems to me that there is political instability coming worldwide (Trump in the USA, several countries might leave the EU, no one really knows what Russia and China are up to...). So the political aspect of bitcoin might play a big role in its advent or demise.

Sorry, not sure what you mean. "Back flip" as in going back downwards?
@_date: 2017-02-16 21:45:23
so.... no idea? :-)

Yeah but that's kind of my point. Media frenzy =&gt; many people buy =&gt; over inflation of the price =&gt; crash.

Exactly what I was just telling my friend. But if the media goes nuts over the "new record value of bitcoin", more people are going to buy. Though, this won't change the actual usability / political value of the currency, so it will have to revert to a lower (more realistic) value.

Srsly though. I'm new to the sub but I do hodl bitcoins. Is there something I don't know about implied units? Is that 5BTC? 5M$?
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:28:01
5 what?
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:41:56
5 who?
