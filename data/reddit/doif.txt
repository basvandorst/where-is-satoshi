If this is your honest opinion I really don't understand why you would want to be involved in cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:08:41
Please don't give people props for being a good scam artist
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:18:39
No they can't. They would have to convince the rest of the network of to be able to do this. Where the hell do you get this information.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:15:10
Oh do you need to do it every week? Are you sure?
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:38:49
Why do you think that
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:44:33
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:07:34
How can you even say that? What is this irrational hate between ETH and BTC?
EDIT: Thank you for downvoting this comment of me asking you a question.

You really need to read the PoC for Meltdown and Spectre. These exploits allow for exactly that what makes it so dangerous.
There are a few ways which can keep us safer like site isolation but that only narrows down a specific entry point. If this were to be combined with for instance Atom Bombing for Windows we are in a whole world of pain.
The ONLY safe way to store your coins for now it seems is to use a hardware wallet since the keys never leave the device.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:51:55
OH BOY!
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:23:39
I prefer people actually using their Bitcoin due to lower fees with Segwit to my personal financial gain tbh.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:30:52
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:41:32
I respectfully disagree
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:15:40
It's hilarious how you think you are right but you actually are really not.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:29:55
And I think you need to explain yourself, because your statement does absolutely nothing to prove your point.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:33:02
Bailing out the rich with money from the middle and lower-class is socialism?
Please try harder.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:27:49
Because in the long run bigger blocks won't cut it when adoption really starts to set in. Andreas did a very good video about this not too long ago. If we want to use Bitcoin for multiple daily transactions we would need bigger than 1TB blocks. Not only do these blocks need to be stored on all nodes to keep the network decentralized but the blocks jeed to be propagated throught the network every 10 minutes. This leads to the problem were many people simply won't run full nodes anymore not only due to storage problems but also bandwidth data caps from their ISPs. What you end up with is a network run by a select group of people who can still afford to run the nodes, aka a centralized network. 
Now on the other hand bigger blocks are not as evil as some people make it out to be. However the way a certain group of people who tried to force bigger block sizes with the Segwit2X fork wanted to do so without proper testing and are literally risking breaking the network. This actually happened to the Segwit2X testnet due to a miscalculation of the blocknumber activation.
TLDR; For massive adoption where people worldwide use Bitcoin as their primary payment system we need such big blocks that the network will become centralized due to only people with enough money being able to run full nodes.
Also I will try to find that Andreas video for you so you don't have to take my word for it.

I understand the analogy, but when we look at the actual content of his tweet it doesn't really apply.
He is making an observation, no more than that. Why would he not post this on the clearweb?

I dunno man. The first guy who did it was cool because he was original.
This is just lame, trying to earn coins fast, lazy and unoriginally.

Tell me why
@_date: 2015-05-17 16:23:19
Let's just agree to disagree. We have a different understanding of what the banking system is for and how it is used.
@_date: 2015-05-16 18:01:43
It's also the de-facto medium of exchange for a lot of people to make end meet.
Imo illicit activities are not enough reason to ban cash entirely. This will also not end these illicit activities because people will find another medium of exchange.
So what will happen is that you make people give away even more control over their money, make it harder for a lot of people to get the money they need to survive and hardly make a dent into organized crime.
Dunno man, doesn't really seem worth it. Unless of course when you are a bank.
@_date: 2015-05-17 01:14:20
I live in the Netherlands and I too have most of my money in the bank. I am talking about other people who do not have this luxury.
It's nice to be able to think about other people and their situation, gives you perspective.
@_date: 2015-05-17 00:15:05
Why do you think the effect will be neutral for law abiding citizens? Not just criminals need cash, a lot of non-criminal activities require cash money at this time.
Also, what do you think will happen if everybody's wealth is located on the servers of a few major banks. Do you think this is a good or bad thing for citizens?
@_date: 2019-03-13 15:06:38
When people counterfeit money they intend to use it to trade for other things of value. By giving another person worthless paper in exchange for valuable goods (or money) they are stealing value from that other person.

Please, use some interpunction.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:56:48
If you are talking about regular everyday citizens then I can see your point. If you are referring to governments, the Fed, and banks, then hell no.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:49:56
Under the radar? lol
@_date: 2016-11-15 02:16:44
It seems unlikely a central bank would allow others to run around with an uncontrollable currency. These moves are to be anticipated.
@_date: 2016-12-12 00:19:20
Have you seen what people on your site are trying to sell?
"Bitcoin hacks - make 0.1 BTC every 10 minutes",
"Free bitcoins!".
Are you kidding me? I think some moderation is in order. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 11:54:33
You seem educated.
@_date: 2018-06-08 12:04:28
Well well well..
@_date: 2016-11-13 12:05:21
I understand what you're saying, it was a mere comment on the way you expressed it.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:34:28
ITT: Hindsight 20/20.
A lot of people here are talking about how smart an investment it was, and they're not wrong. However, please do not forget that no one here had the foresight of this happening. No one here could have predicted the steep price increase of bitcoin.
So when your friends said to not borrow money to invest in bitcoin, they were right. So I would like to urge to keep this in mind when making future investments, not only related to bitcoin.
Just my 2cents.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:18:33
Although I agree with you, let's try to educate people instead of shunning them away.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:40:16
I believe in the technology, and I recognize it's potential value. However with all the politics, greed, governments and big banks there is still a lot of uncertainty about where Bitcoin will go. So no, you didn't have the foresight back in 2013 that you would have made this much money in 2017 using Bitcoin.
Unless you have that one magic eightball that does work.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:50:56
Until your ISP decides they are going to cap specific traffic like the BTC network. Net Neutrality will prevent that.
Please don't act like Net Neutrality isn't a big deal, because it is.

Interesting read, however the conclusion seems to be "We don't know therefore it can be A or B".
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:34:11
Why are you not concerned about the fact that they would print USDT out of nothing and for instance purchasing other crypto with it driving up the price? Would we still evaluate Bitcoin at the same price?
I'm genuinely asking, because I'm having a hard time people not seeing this as a problem. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:22:04
of course you can compare different lifestyles, you compare to point out differences.
@_date: 2018-02-19 00:37:57
Thank you for an honest reply, that's more than I can say of most people stepping into a discussion in this market.
One dollar for 10 tether would still be an substantial decrease in value I assume, seeing how much USDT volume is traded daily on a lot of big exhanges. I guess we can only speculate at this point.
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:28:28
Although I agree with the statement that this is not an acceptable standard being used by Bitpay, one could argue that not using Bitpay would be a fairly "easy" countermeasure.
I still rank Tether as a bigger posing problem to Bitcoin and other crypto at this time.
