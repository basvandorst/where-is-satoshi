I believe they see the future of hope and change and hold until it does or invest what they can in their own way. Changing the world one new wallet at a time.
@_date: 2015-06-17 04:25:15
Yes indeed. Think of it n like a stock for the time being. The market for which is anyone who uses money.

@_date: 2015-05-03 22:17:11
is this a trick question? Dollars are backed by printers and promises. Bitcoin is backed by Computers and Community.

Have you looked at BitMex they have some tools for trading BTC on Volume now. Maybe this new volume will be a useful resource to check volatility as well.
@_date: 2015-05-13 05:04:36
BTC is going strong. it is just a matter of time and human innovation.
@_date: 2015-05-16 04:27:34
If there is a system I would try it

I think they believe with the meshnet the total hash combined might make it a feasible miner... 
@_date: 2015-05-04 04:12:55
I simply try to explain it is cheaper by eliminating the middle man.  Businesses understand that.
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:23:39

Found one!
@_date: 2015-05-21 04:34:33

Checking that out for the 240 acres I help manage up north for feed plots and shared hunting and photography 
@_date: 2015-05-03 22:09:00
it is if you are a developer looking to make some alt coin that makes you Bitcoin. about 320 satoshi per POT at the moment. Thus 255k POT is about 2 Bitcoin ish
@_date: 2015-05-04 04:14:49
I did that too when I started.

@_date: 2015-05-20 21:00:23
yeah I think I may go to my local seed guys where I had bought feed for the hobby farm when I was a child. See if they have a honey bee mix to add to the already sown in white clover. Also only 3.5 acres were tilled for planting.

I bought my friends work shoes through purse.io and paid in POT coin through Shapeshift. It was very simple. Shoes arrived 3 days later. I then released the escrow.
@_date: 2015-05-18 08:28:11
Completely False
@_date: 2015-05-04 06:22:20
@_date: 2015-05-11 17:33:40
I love using Purse.io and You can use ALT coins as well. I bought some shoes for a friend for 66.5k POT coin the other week doing just that and received the shoes already to boot.

ETF? What mean this?
I've been watching the price now for 10 days and its become a strange obsession. 
So far I feel like alot of illegitimate made bitcoin is being dumped.
2nd large private investors are bailing if they bought at 400-700+ 
Lots of pre-mined and hoarded coins are being sold of as well simply as part of the panic.
Price is stabilizing but we may see 170$ yet.
Just a theory from a guy who is hardly sleeping. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:22:15
Thank you again for yet more wonderful innovation. I hope the community continues to support you. +100 Internet love points and ponies.

I think these are valid and positive points and will help the overall image of The World Wide Ledger, Block-Chain, and Bitcoin Trio.
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:02:31
I would love to see a seemless wallet that had a gif of the change tip hat tipping the hat when the transaction is sent :)

@_date: 2016-01-15 16:32:29
Feeling the same way especially watching global markets bleeding
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:41:34
I've been on Cex.io its chaos. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 20:49:51
This is what I have been doing too. I was super lucky to start hedging some extra money towards it after buying in at 177$ for 200$. 
Bought about 10 tacos sick at differing prices and stopped at 250$ 
as I have other tacos to purchase elsewhere and have seen my BTC investments grow about 30% across the board. I'm very happy right now. 
I bought coins I liked and trust. Now I see others due too.
I believe there will be a new kind of exchange here in the next 60 days.
A better bigger "shiny" thing to suck up all the others low trading posts. Prices will continue to rise and if you hold what you have for your intended goals I think this Crypto Revolution may have a real winning shot at "Changing the world".
but what do I know I'm just HotHighAir after all.
@_date: 2015-01-18 09:39:04
Thank goodness!!! BTC FTW!
@_date: 2015-01-28 05:13:04
I would say as a savings and fun adventure. Adding the wallets and experimenting with faucets and give aways would be your best bet. Buying with currency is likely yet out of the equation.  Do actions and be rewarded in coin.
@_date: 2015-05-06 02:05:08
This is really promising for ALT coins with communities to "Prove" it and buy a 100 
@_date: 2015-01-28 04:01:54
Your again too kind. I've sent through the new changetip over 4000 bits to folks but waiting for them to accept is frustrating.
@_date: 2015-01-28 05:19:33

This is right on. I have the same difficulty transferring my checks. cashing. etc... if I had a digital transaction receipt would it not be the same as a verification from my bank, *that my funds were transferred successfully?
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:25:08
agreed! Banks are seeing the end of the mule that has been making them the fees that pay their salaries. Fiat and the printer can't keep up the Quantitative Easing forever and they know it!

Yup Bits to Win
@_date: 2015-05-20 04:41:56
Very much so. It is the World Wide Ledger. Value is being understood Globally. Bitcoin is like a Jelly fish in the sea of Finance and it is dragging Alt Coins with it snagging fiat from the sea. The Jelly Fish still could be crushed but it is stinging the fish all the same and many are willingly giving the Jellyfish lots of free food. * It lets you invest in anything anywhere they have an address...

Trezors make it pretty simple to create accounts for savings, car, etc.... I've made 25+ accounts for rainyday etc... You write down a key at the beginning and update firmware then poof your ready to start.

just buy 100 bucks of top 100 alts and you have created a hedge if BTC falls. Easy relax. Fiat is still dying.
@_date: 2015-01-28 04:05:40
I would love to give my time to market the coin

We need to get along to craft the better financial public song so all may enjoy each a note of freedom through the tempest of life that is or human ball dance and compelled ballad.
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:38:27
So far for the good. I helped wiki leaks way back and always felt it was a good thing. I got back into Bitcoin this January again and have not looked back to saving in Fiat. 
I work for the fiat but I hope in Bitcoin for the future of money and value. I want to see the world and think it will be best done through btc to local fiat atm or straight btc exchanges. 
We needed this kind of financial disruption to set this world on track towards resource management instead of exploitation. Bitcoin demands a positive economy for growth. Thus a symbiotic relationship between those who use it and exchange for services and goods will always seek to have more product and resources available at a sustainable rate or what they earn will not be worth much in the future... maybe that argument needs more work. But the fact remains Bitcoin is here to stay due to the nature of the Block Chain and open ledger ideaology it has birthed.
@_date: 2016-01-08 22:59:44
governments of each country secures their own % of the chain is fine as long as the whole thing doesn't become centralized.

@_date: 2016-06-14 09:37:01
yes sir
@_date: 2017-01-28 04:21:02
I have similar results and have lost more than I have earned. It has been sad but I believed in people but often folks want handouts and never return. It is mostly my fault when I made the investment but I was hoping at least to be a bit positive instead of 20% + in the negative.
@_date: 2016-01-16 05:08:06
it is yet to find bloom and it is winter so the spring will bring growth and added adoption as folks use such apps as Gyft to conduct regular shopping adventures
@_date: 2016-06-14 08:59:19

Gold is heading to 770
@_date: 2015-08-06 19:45:27
it has been around forever and there is lots unaccounted for. Mystery money is detrimental to trust. Trust in transacting across borders and from one peer to the next is "digital cash" and gold simply cannot be traded and divided without substantial cost if you had true settlement from one transaction to the next.
@_date: 2015-08-07 00:02:20
Gut feeling and my own logic seeing current innovation trends
@_date: 2015-08-13 19:15:35

what if a device comes out that can draw trace gold from any and everything like a magnet. You go for a jog and have .001 grams collected... it adds up.

so can I use this on steam?
@_date: 2015-07-22 23:23:59
yeah I really want to buy it but truly if I do I won't keep working on what generates me more BTC/USD thus I'm going to have to wait to make the inevitable investment.
@_date: 2015-07-20 01:48:16
Yes indeed
@_date: 2015-07-29 08:57:41
taxes are ok in theory but in current practice are true waste
@_date: 2015-07-13 22:06:37
what if the publicity drives investors abroad to snap up the dump? 
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:50:22
coinkite + Nightly or weekly (timed) Fiat or choice like Bitwage/Bitreserve integration salary payments etc... are then paid out respectively by choice. keep a 1% growing balance for everything until you have a "safe" balance as you see fit.
@_date: 2015-07-07 22:37:58
I would have a "Money Making Fund" 2x the normal volume of the night in ready to spend or send cash. thus at the end of each night you collect the checks to be deposited. you buy the check value of bitcoin from the deposits that cleared the day before. send your cash out to fiat in 97.9% and save coin in case volatility?
@_date: 2015-07-28 04:52:43
That is pretty dang sweet I want that in the USA
@_date: 2015-07-23 08:15:30
It is beyond a step in the right direction.
@_date: 2015-07-13 22:27:18
I'm just far too hopeful then I guess. I see the light at the end of the financial collapse that has begun and I want to rush right on to the finish line.
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:50:59
seriously crypto is doing just that. I'm on that mental boat sailor.
@_date: 2015-07-23 08:16:32

Humanity can be corrupt and in the twist of selfishness we dig into the weakness of out friends and those most vulnerable sometimes. We learn though from it and wind up a better people. Tools we craft create the next generation of tools like the auto then car or bow then gun. Internet then Bitcoin. We learn to adapt and roll with the punches but ultimately we drop the bullshit and grasp the reality of what truly works. This XBT Spiff simply works and thus trust is built.

I've talked with a local restaurant whom is willing to do this with me soon :) So I'm glad that is a good thing to do. My rent is less than 400$ a month in central MN. Thus working as a waiter at a 20$+ plate place 3-4 days a week + having tiping on my QR in each bill placement as an option too may help. I'll always accept what the establishment does though without qualm or question though. But I'll be able to inform those whom ask. I'm not hired yet but should be by the end of the month or as soon as my other chef friend is back from Colorado visiting family for Easter.

Funny thing I was in Wells FArgo in St.Cloud the other day and was offered the ability to have a debit card attached to the value of my Bitcoin on the exchange they would set internally. He went and explained what I just said to his superior and after 20 minutes he returned and said they were aware of Bitcoin but were unable to at this time offer such a service. I was disappointed but it was what it was I guess. 
The only reason I went in was as backup for my gal as she was hoping to be able to set up a secondary account under her primary to deposit XYZ money for rent and bills and Sh**. Long story short it would cost 5$ a month for a new account to do such a thing. 
Point is Bitcoin makes it all manageable to YOU.

Similar story I had today. I went to the St.Cloud mall and asked about 20 merchants if they accepted Bitcoin.
I had a 7 of those 20 confirm they have plans to do some kind of app or they were actively seeking a solution to be able to accept it. 
the other 13 simply had not heard of it which led into an explanation and ended mostly with "huh I'm going to look into it" and 2 straight up "NOPE NEVER GONNA HAPPEN".
After my couple hours at the mall today I went then to 2 of the branches of my local bank in St.Cloud and gave the personal banker I talked with "The Age of Crypto.... the one from Amazon" and asked them to pass the book along to their managers but were free to page through it until the day's end themselves. (both were incredibly intrigued and very young people too)
The last stop I made though was to my financial adviser who manages a lot of my family member's portfolios. 
I happen to get really lucky as I was only planning to drop the same Age of Crypto book off as I said I would in our e-mails earlier in the week. He was leaving for the weekend early and I was able to tell him about the other books and merchants I talked to as we made the quick exchange and he went WHITE. As if he was now behind the curve of money and financial innovation.
Something to keep in mind I am very striking as a person and "look like a geek" (I was in slacks and a button up with my long hair in a pony) 
He after our brief exchange without a word went straight back into his office with the book. Either now trying to avoid me on the elevator or now reading I have no clue. I just have never seen him go stark white before. 
Anyway that is my story.

@_date: 2015-02-13 05:54:47
Buy into the coins with the most market cap. top 20. Don't fear and doubt. if this is a sales thing go hop in a lake of fire. 
Bitcoin is the king yet but DRK is rising above LTC
DGB is a great "Linkedin" kind of coin
PPC is simply top knotch and will continue with the market cap
There is a YBC coin for china that is bringing competition
and UNB on Cryptsy is on fire because of the rarity and security
Simply put don't buy junk buy the trusted coins and you won't lose out in the long haul. Enjoy and never put more than what you can lose at this point into the market.
Its going up as it has stabilized a lot this week but there may yet be road bumps.
