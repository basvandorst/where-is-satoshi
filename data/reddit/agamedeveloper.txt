Well I put my bigger BTC savings away on a Keepkey. And while half a BTC is a lot of money its not like I am going to lose out on everything. But this would suck though. I have to admit.

The government should create its own Bitcoin where transactions automatically account for paying taxes. If the system was done right they can get rid of most of the IRS.

Yeah anything is possible. Will be really sad if I cant buy from or trust Coinbase anymore. I read that sometimes it takes 3 days after it says it will arrive... At this rate shipping me a harddrive FedEx would be faster lol
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:30:19
I had an experience where I paid for 0.51 BTC and it stated that it "Arrives today" for close to 3 weeks. I tried to ask what was going on and got an email where it asked me to send an email. I created maybe 3 or 4 tickets and got NOTHING.
SO once I started to feel like they were basically going to rip me off I went to my bank to throw them under the buss. Suddenly the transaction goes through magically that same night.
Luckily I was able to cancel the charge back. But what the fuck kind of place will keep your money for half a month with no explanation and not even respond when you ask WTF is going on?
@_date: 2016-08-18 18:48:58


That's a solid argument actually, thank you for this.
@_date: 2016-08-21 22:12:06
Well they need to improve on this a bit more. I tried to buy Bitcoin recently and my bank flagged it as a fraudulent charge and rejected the process. I went to my bank and straightened things out. Banks sometimes do this kind of stuff so I didn't think much of it.
Once the problem was fixed with my bank I found out that Coinbase has 100% rejected my card forever and there is nothing I can do. All because my stupid bank potentially decided that they dont like me buy bitcoin.
I contact costumer support and nearly a week and a half later I get a message that due to the fact my bank did that my card is forever blocked from their service. They literally told me I need to get a new card.

Give the average person a tangible advantage to having the coins and suddenly it will be on the list. Right now bitcoin don't seem like a good thing to the average person.

Never, EVER attempt to buy something with BTC you have sitting on an exchange. Not only are exchanges super slow but they sometimes take a small cut of the transaction as a fee.
I made the mistake of spending BTC to buy a game on steam and quickly learned the hard way that money on an exchange is almost as useless as money in cold storage.

You mean you would have gained 80% in your savings account and your debt would be the same as it was before it went up. 
Trying to standardize a crypto in the same way you standardize fiat is probably impossible. You have to literally think of owning Bitcoin like owning gold bars or silver.

It would make it harder for people to work in larger teams to accomplish larger goals. For example, the internet would have taken a lot longer to grow in a world with consistently deflating currency value...
But then on that same coin I am often afraid to spend my bitcoins because I know in 5 years that same BTC will likely be worth a lot more... Like that guy who bought a pizza for ten thousand bitcoins...

However, based on the current trends BCH is about to explode. And it may end up staying above 2k after this next fiasco.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:41:39
Not doing something for 36 months when you have a small nimble team who knows what they are doing falls easily under negligence.
Its very safe to assume they simply don't want faster / cheaper transactions. That's a very long time.
I kind of think that BTC doesn't actually care or want to solve the problem. And it makes sense that a ragtag bunch of semi idiots with scrupulous intents would possibly grab the torch and change the one line of code.
This is bad optics all around.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:34:12
Ok first off, the centralization thing you are talking about isn't even really centralization, its just harder to mine larger blocks. But anyone can do it if they decide to try. its not really centralization by any means.
Anyway, decentralization is nice but MOST PEOPLE dont care about it. Normies feel more comfortable using centralized platforms, because that is what they use all of the time. Decentralization may not matter in the grand scheme of things for every coin. Some coins can be centralized, some can be decentralized.
If a bit of centralization speeds things up then most people wont care. In fact, the kind of centralization we are talking about is just as true for BTC as it is for BCH. BTC is designed to become more centralized over time as each halving increases mining difficulty.
So not only does it not really determine the value of the coin. Your original point is bullshit anyway. Did someone tell you to say this?
And second of all


Not really, because a major strength of crypto currency is that it can be integrated into all kinds of potential systems. Its much harder, nearly impossible to make a system like Steemit for example with something other than a crypto currency.
Crypto isn't just about dodging taxes people, its a technology with many uses.

Because bringing up someones reputation is a signal that he is not a moral person who most people will not view him as trust worthy. Otherwise the entire point of making him out to be a liability wouldn't make sense. An untrustworthy person is an immoral person.
Him being a liability based on if you think people should trust him is not contingent on how effective his campaign can be. In other words both sides of this debate are not to be trusted and neither side is less effective for it.

If it touches 4k though its time jump ship 
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:39:44
Bitcoin only looks bigger because its value is higher.
You will be looking at a drop in gains due to lower adoption. Now keep in mind I am not saying BTC is going to die. It will eventually reach 10000 +. But its going to slow down. Once you leave the Goldilocks scenario where the vast majority of newcomers cant afford a single coin adoption will soft cap off.
BCH only needs to go up 400 (2000 total USD) and it will have reached 10000 dollars. So while Bitcoin reaches 10k BCH only needs to reach 2k to keep up. If BCH reaches higher than 2k before BTC reaches 10k then its obvious that BTC is not as good of a coin for new comers.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:42:27
Wait is this a fork that is being done to hobble the coin in a clear and obvious way?
That would backfire as the coin would be dumped by most people and force the price of BCH up. Although, interestingly enough, you could possibly hit BCH with an infinite pump attack as well.
All forks can cause infinite pump scenarios. BTC has gold and silver coming up...
This is a fucking mess!
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:20:50
The people who hold the coin have a vested interest to keep its value as high as possible. The only ones capable of dropping the price like that would be the ones holding the most coin. There is also incentive to constantly inflate its value to game the system as well.
This isn't tulips, its a self correcting system with incentives to game it as much as possible. And rather than some form of degenerative strategy the coin is designed in such a way where the most optimal methods of self gain are going to raise the value for all holders.
Its not a bubble, its a value virus. Humans have created money Tribbles.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:01:00
Some bubbles last long enough that it doesn't matter if its a bubble or not. BTC is in a bubble where something very specific has to happen to ruin it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:14:13
BCH is going to decline if BTC keeps moving up. BTC is going to hit 8k which means BCH is going sub 1k. Don't panic, if that buy wall is what I think it is then its the starting point of the infinite pump and dump.

In January ETH was 7.00 bucks a pop right?
BTC was about 1000-1500 each right?
So lets say you are regular joe with about a 1000 USD in January of 2017.
If regular Joe bought a little less 1 btc he would have had a decent investment.
If regular Joe picked up 1000 USD worth of ETH in January he would be sitting on massive gains.
I constantly am seeing people come in here with 100-1000 bucks asking about when its a good time to get into BTC. The honest truth BTC train left awhile back for normal people.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:55:03
Crypto currency is a value virus. It tugs on all of the key aspects of human emotion, even addiction.
The only reason I see a bubble is when the coin is more valued than its actual functionality. The Bitcoin derivatives are first pass vanilla proof of concept coins. Pay close attention to the 2nd and third generation coins. The go to will be when the coin has some sort of feature or gimmick. Steem being a social network platform. ETH / EOS are back ends for greater functionality.
Nobody has noticed or cared about the other coins yet. BTC is slower and more expensive as well.
I can name 5 other coins off the top of my head that should be pushing 10k instead of BTC. It is a bubble. Its obviously a bubble.

Its the same thing happening all over again. See a bunch of computer software execs laugh in unison over the idea of some peripheral called a "mouse". But in a lot of ways I can take your points and use them against electric cars, solar panels. 
It even makes sense to have push back against the automobile vs horses.


How many places have you been? The second you leave America you wont be using USD very much. You will end up usually having to go through exchanges for local currency. At that bitcoin is probably slightly BETTER as you wont have to deal with any bullshit if you do manage to find places that accept it.
On that same note, its really not that hard to convert BTC to USD. Coinbase has made it almost too easy. I have been enjoying it quite a bit over the last few months. I use a blogging page called Steemit to talk about a game I am working on and the page rewords a crupto currency that is easily exchanged for BTC. I predict that in a few years you will begin earning some kind of crypto currency simply for doing things on the internet. A web browser called Brave apparently allows people to tip you.
Its entirely possible one day your kharma on reddit will be converted to BTC. At that point if you decide to not take the "free money" that's your problem.
I don't even see the issue with exchanging it really. Once you get used to it you don't even really have to think about it.
Your strongest counter arguments to crypto currency is government crackdown and the other is Quantum computing.
Government crackdown would have to be VERY extensive to be possible and would likely be about as successful as the war on drugs. The coins would become MORE popular probably...
Quantum computing my very well make all password protection completely worthless. In light of that it may be able to completely take apart the block chain. But in that case it will have already just ravaged everything else in the process. Your fiat currency located in your bank account is more ill prepared again Quantum computers.
So you don't care about buying crypto much today, thats completely understandable. Your going to end up using it eventually anyway. Most alt media already uses the blockchain and bitcoin tipping will slowly become the norm. Your kids are going to laugh at you one day for spending time on a page that didn't reward you with money for posting content.

The problem with your entire post is that you are not realizing that he can and probably will gain from this attack. The last attack was a profit for him. You can bet your ass the next 5 will also be a profit as well. all he has to do is keep a steady flow of attacks and he will tank BTC while blowing up BCH value.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:00:34
That's still not an excuse to refuse to change the one variable from 1 to 8 to avoid having a life sucking BCH leech that may eventually cause a schism in the entire Bitcoin community.


Its a solution for right now. If not for any other reason than to have nipped the BCH situation politically.
I honestly feel like they are refusing to do it. Because they are bought out and they are being bribed by the big banks to make sure the coin is slow and shitty. Because there is no reason not to do it and its changing one variable.
This conspiracy theory has to be put to rest or it WILL fester.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:39:52
A lot and a large number of them are crap. Its a gamble but your long term payoff is much higher with smaller investments. Where with BTC you are guaranteed at least a small payoff, but for long term an alt may provide a much larger payoff.
Some of these coins are worth less than a penny each. Some are worth mere dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:08:23
I completely agree especially on the religion thing. I have said the same thing many times myself.
Only thing I will push back on is that in politics perception almost always trumps reality. The new feature, being faster and cheaper. A lot of this is a psychological battle.
Perhaps people on the BTC side of things can work harder on pointing out that BCH wont actually be faster and cheaper. That it will end up being roughly the same. I don't think anyone is going to buy that though. This has become an anti-establishment ideological battle against what seemingly looks like a bunch of cultist / theists who are bad at debating. (Not you)
The perception of the shiny new coins being the way forward is inevitable.

9 years is a long time but we have many much better coins (Not even talking about BCH) out right now.
Did you know that steem is 30 second transfer with zero fee? LTC is better hands down than BTC and BCH, it could frankly replace both tomorrow.
In the technological world, functionality is king. Faster and cheaper always wins long term. BTC is going to be fine for a long time but long term its not going to last unless the coin changes to compete.


Not anymore, you can make more dumping 500 bucks on an alt than you can on BTC today. Look at EOS right now.


That network has no loyalty


No it means BTC is being artificially propped up by factors other than its technology. And that is a bubble.

This entire debate is because of this problem.


They promise that they will get something in place in more than a year from now. Literally every other major alt coin already functions better and brings more to the table.


The devs have failed, the only solution is to fire them and replace Bitcoin with almost literally any other coin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:23:46
I was wrong on how far down it would go. The drop lasted a very small amount of time. I was expecting it to float in the mid 6000s for a week.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:30:11
Well at that point you can do anything. Even fiat currency for the heck of it.
It still feels really convoluted though. Why not just use LTC for everything? The coin is not exactly going down in value. And I wouldn't need some extra system on the side.

16 hour shift hardcore.
Too be clear, my assertion on this is that this is the start of an unlimited pump and dump by using BCH and BTC against each other. The coins behave in such a way where its super predictable if one goes down the other goes up.

This is going to be normal, the cats out of the bag. I will be doing the same in a bit.
Good luck on future profits. 
Also I seriously doubt this will kill either coin. I think both coins will eventually reach roughly the same value though. No FUD here just pump pump pump pump
Holy shit the graphs are carbon copies of each other. Just one is up and the other is down lol

It already is for me. Though I have been more effected by Steemit than bitcoin directly. My worry is that if the last few days are an indication of the kind of things we can expect from the future.
Cryptocurrency my very well end up being insanely toxic, not from an asset standpoint but from a propaganda standpoint. I never realized how true this can become until I am seeing a battle between two forked coins.
holy shit, is this really how things are going to be?

@_date: 2017-11-06 02:35:32
I agree! It will also keep a lot of smaller countries in check. Anyone world leader that spirals its currency into the ground will simply learn that people stopped using the currency altogether. It might keep them in check as well.
The coins can also be integrated easily into new systems and ideas. Imagine a world where almost everything you do rewards some kind of coin. Looking at videos on Youtube earns you google coins! Walking down the street gets you sweat coins! clicking an advertisement gets you advertisement coins!
Decentralized privatized socialism.

@_date: 2017-11-15 12:44:31
If you see a pump that is not indicative of normal growth. always be prepared for the dump after. But this time might be different as it looks like there is huge resistance to preventing the dump from going too low. Might be an extra fuck you to the BCH side of things.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:28:39
Is Bitcoin considered real money all of a sudden? Funny how that works. When you talk about it its fake money. But when someone wants it. Real money again!

The main argument is that you should use fiat instead. BTC is not meant to be used for stuff like coffee. And if you believe otherwise its because you are Korean Hitler. :X
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:50:59


Its objectively true. Name one ground breaking feature BTC has that market will care about that beats faster and cheaper OTHER THAN a bubble. The bubble is the main feature BTC has to offer.

Punish the honest ones and let the dishonest people run free...
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:40:40


Sure, but in a technology space like this. Its a massive risk to back the horse and buggy. Either BTC gets cheaper and faster or it loses. This isn't console wars where the differences are negligible. One sucks and the other doesn't. And if the one that sucks doesn't up its game soon this entire situation will fester. And if you think things have permanence you risk being in for a rude awakening. 
I see a lot of problems on the pro BTC in terms of how their arguments work. Its either ad hom or the lie that 8 mb will suddenly cause centralization. That is what concerns me most. Every time I have one of these discussions I am seeing the kind of desperation visible from any group who is clearly going to lose long term. Its making me very cautious when thinking of stay in the BTC side of things.
BCH doesnt need to be worth the same right now to accomplish what is needed. It just needs to slow things down and fuck with things a bit. All it has to do is be a Monkey on BTC's back pulling it down to cause major problems. And if Roger begins doing pump and dumps when BTC is doing it scheduled ATH runs then its GG. Moral is very much at risk.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:08:14
Now is a good time to have an equal number of both coins.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:58:53
That's what I would have said before this happened like 4 times in the last year and change. Seriously, just look at how its already been going. Its like predicting old faithful at this point.
The best part will be how literally everyone will act like "this is it this time! The end of bitcoin!" and you will see a whole bunch of "This has never happened before!!"
edit: My favorite will be the people posting pictures of a graph where BTC suddenly drops off by a large amount again. Then there will be a bunch of in fighting and talking about what coin will take BTC's place.
And there will be those poor saps that make the "OH no, I just bought in at $7500 super sad face!!"
Its not a question of IF this will happen its a question of when and at what point. People seem to like whole numbers so 7000-7500-8000 thats my guess.

Bitcoin is the technical response to that problem.

@_date: 2017-11-19 06:59:57
Being in charge of git doesn't denote centralization. Otherwise Core would be doing the same thing.
On that note community consensus would have been to vote against making BCH a coin that can cause trouble for BTC.

You will get a bigger pay off if you do this with alts. The problem with that is picking a good alt to go with and not panicking the second it goes down 20% 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:33:49
Transaction fees average 3-5 dollars every time you use the coin. You will often be forced to pay upwards of 20 dollars even if you only wanted to move 5 dollars worth of BTC.

@_date: 2017-11-02 12:26:11
on the bright side, Quantum computers also make all or most passwords pretty worthless as well so.... That will pretty much fuck us anyway so to hear its even possible that BTC can potentially survive is amazing. My bank account with fiat probably couldn't pull that off.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:56:06
The only thing that might kill BTC is quantum computers or the government. So on one hand we have some sad ass scifi B movie shit going on that might actually happen. On the other we have a coin going up by a few thousand percent based on supply and demand. At least one is based on something tangible.

Only if BTC gets improvements. Otherwise this fiasco may continue potentially forever.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:23:52


I like this argument but, they had 36 months right?
Core did nothing in 36 months to solve the problem. If I was in charge of a team of talented people and someone came up with a major problem with scaling I would be working on a solution within the first month. We would have meetings and discuss it publicly.
36 months. Core is responsible for this problem, 36 months is far more than enough time to address the most important issue your product has. Even if BCH is a total flop, even if the people are kind of idiots (Honestly they kind of are)
It doesn't matter. This is negligence on Core's part. Core created this scenario. The responsibility is on THEM.

From ideological perspective a virus can be viewed as form of inoculation sure.
Bitcoin causes its host to gain value to a point where the coin is harder to spend than it is to hold. As its value continues to increase the virus spreads to others. in turn those people find it difficult to spend the coins as well and thus hold them. This causes the value to increase more causing more attention toward the coin spreads the virus further.
Imagine Gollum from Lord of the rings holding his precious bitcoins. The eventual landscape will be thousands and thousands of Gollums who are multimillionaires afraid to spend a single dime of their coin.
I believe that Bitcoin is a well constructed Value virus that exploits the shit out of human nature to generate wealth.

This is a pump, hold steady, the coin is going to drop back to 6k~ once it reaches just under or just above 7k
After that it will recover and steady out then slowly move above 7k.
edit: Its going to be slightly annoying to see people use this as an argument that "Bitcoin just may not be able to go any higher. Like it just couldn't make it to 7k, cry and whine about it like this has never happened before.

Sure but a very big aspect is the adoption and the the number of general transactions that are around fixed prices. Right now all we have is whales barons and bots running performing war on each other and nothing else.
I don't think crypto has a shot at being stable until its used for almost everything by a much larger number of people.
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:14:04
There is a BTC difficulty adjustment coming up and it will lock in place for 2 weeks. So the BCH people are armed and ready to wreck BTC during a time when it cannot react.
Personally, hearing shit like this just makes me glad I diversified. Cuz fuck man...

Sounds like Siacoin actually 
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:22:18
This is just false narrative. The 8 mb block is not enough to cause centralization. The argument is that if the block was increased to 32 or 128 then it would cause this problem.
Its a false argument to say 8mb is going to cause this problem. Its a slippery slope fallacy. Its like if someone suggests raising the block size to 2 mb then imediatly people respond with "Oh why don't we just make it a million block size!"
Its a dumb argument stop using it.
With that said, there are other coins that are just as decentralized and far better feature wise than BTC or BCH. I do not recommend we walk down the path of comparing BCH to LTC because LTC is also a lot better than BTC as well.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:45:52
Its getting some resistance. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:45:46
This is the correct answer.
But to ad to that, debate is the second most important vector.
BTC needs to become faster and cheaper or it will lose the debate long term.

Red flag, ANY time you see arguments that paint one side as 2d caricatures its propaganda. This is almost NEVER the case. Also 8 mb wont centralize anything. 32 mb or 128 would be another story.
You have been lied to.

Yep. Also doing a spiraling pump would be very profitable for the ones that started it.

6500 and it will go back up fast. Same thing happened last time.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:05:11
There is actually a gambit of terrible things people have to go through to become true crypto users.
Wrong address or wrong wallet, feeling fud and fomo when you don't even know what those terms are and that first time you learn day trading is not something you can casually do.
Welcome to the future asshole.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:31:25
Yeah but if you can create a predictable environment in a situation where personal gain is possible then its just a real world money exploit. Like in video games where people figure out how to get unlimited lives.

50 sat might as well be free. Ill look into this some more though. The promissory note aspect makes nervous because it sounds a lot like fiat.

Your call is as good as mine on that. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:13:20
It looks like it doesn't matter either way. The plan will be to make both coins worth roughly the same. so go ahead and sell. what will happen is one coin will increase in value while the other goes down.
Hold the coin going up dump the coin going down. If enough people do it, that would spiral the market uncontrollably.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:06:28
BCH is pumping atm..
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:16:15
So what exactly would determine my transaction fee? Would there be a fee at all?
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:56:45


Yeah it does. You are full of shit, I'm calling you out on this. From a logical perspective. Money matters to you. And time is money.

Shit is happening FAST!!!
Its kind of like people are pumping BTC with BCH for an extended amount of time. Hmm :D
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:30:09




None of this fucking matters. Either you have the better coin or YOU LOSE. It doesn't matter who Ver is it doesn't matter what he did in the past. If his coin was better then that's all that matters. Nobody should give a shit about that guy.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:54:40


The bubble is the feature and I dont believe that BCH would have said feature. All that will happen is that the both coins will tear each other down in an infinite pump and dump.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:10:35
Yeah I plan to get out of this when they get close to each other. I am mostly sure we will be fine if they meet in the middle. But this will be going on for days I suspect. Maybe weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:26:52
I feel like this is a little too close to home when looking at things like the .com bubble. People just stopped caring and bought everything because everything was going up in value anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:36:55


Its not its own thing. It came from BTC and everyone got the same number of coins. Its part of the BTC eco system.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:23:09
Explain to me how that statement was a straw man. By itself even out of context it still holds true. I am pointing out that claiming that poor leadership is a liability based on ideological differences do not directly hinge on how effective their campaign can be. 
You should be very worried about a very real threat to the "establishmnet" .. BTC's close ties to big banks and its current monopoly are also liability. The idea that they arerefusing to change the block size because they are bought and paid for and they refuse to address the problem is a liability.
Very lucrative liabilities I might add. Go go 7000! But a liability nonetheless.
Stop throwing stones man. You are better off not taking a moral high ground because you will lose that fight.
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:46:44
Bitcoin itself is in a bubble, but its not the kind of bubble that is likely to pop on its own. BCH could cause problems.
But the Bitcoin bubble is simply that the coin by itself, is not the best coin out there. Its slow, its more expensive. There are other coins that just out do it. If people were to catch wind of this factor it then a mass switcing to a better coin could just up heave the entire situation.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:12:17
But I cant use gold to pay for my coffee!! :O
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:23:01
Welp that means BCH is toast. I wonder if there will be at least one more pump or if suddenly BCH will also get LN now. :X
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:57:56
Very little will actually change.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:09:31


To use litecoin instead!
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:20:04
It actually means a lot of leaders infighting with each other constantly and not doing simple things like increasing block size.

But "muh morals! Roger Ver is a BAD PERSON!!!!"
Its dumb, this whole thing is stupid.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:07:37


I think a lot of people get stuck in this mindset like it really matters. What matters is, which coin will be worth more. Which coin will win. Talking about the people and the tactics is nothing more than propaganda. Even if its all true, it doesn't matter if BCH reaches and stays above 2-3k the coin will have won as being a viable investment.
And if it keeps going up like BTC then. Why do we care about any of this shit. Because "muh morals"?
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:21:57
I bailed mostly from both coins during this event. That way I know when to buy back in.
But dragon slayer is going to be a 2 week attack. This is a marathon not a sprint.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:32:31
Actually, the only way for the price to stabalize is if people start using the coin for goods and services. Without that, its up 2k down 2k every 2 weeks.
And the BCH stuff is hardly over.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:23:31
Honestly, I worry about litecoin because BTC will likely end up getting the lightning network functionality of its own down the road. Dash and Steem are already faster. I highly suggest you look at cheaper coins and see what they are about. 
Make sure to ask questions like :
"What is this coins track record so far?"
"Will I personally like or use these features?"
"Can I use these features now or is it way off pie in the sky stuff?"
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:46:27

Normally yes. In this case, literally Hitler can walk into the room and say, "Core is bought out by big banks that's why they refuse to change the block size."
Repeat the message over and over again and it WILL cause problems. I cite his reputation as irrelevant. And if the guy has any charisma, I haven't heard him speak yet, we will be looking at a schism in BTC and it WILL effect things.
Perception trumps reality 100% of the time on any political stage.

It doesn't matter. Core looks guilty right now.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:59:45
yep, all major movement with the two coins go together.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:44:13
The fiat looks like its being pumped into BTC right now to keep the price above 7k. And there is an awful lot of cheap BCH right now. all it would take right now is one solid push ... and boom. Spiral spiral spiral
If someone is keeping the price above 7k BTC then you could exploit the shit out of that right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:00:56
This is a good argument. But I am not yet convinced I wont get hit with the high fees of the transaction. So if I do a transaction it auto switches to another coin (Of my choice?) and does it with that coin?
That sounds great, but I would still need to use BTC to buy that coin right?
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:25:47
I am actually :D
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:56:14
Just read the article again and replace bitcoin with gold or silver.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:50:19
It doesn't matter, this attack is because people realized that BTC and BCH are part of the same eco system. If BTC goes up BCH goes down. If BCH goes up BTC goes down.
People milking this right now. I bet you this isnt even Roger Ver its just ANYONE WITH A BRAIN AND MONEY. Unlimited pump and dump. If you don't believe me look at the charts yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:42:02

@_date: 2017-11-22 00:09:34
The only thing I see right now is a bunch of super freaked out butt hurt partisans on a fear crusade. This makes me think there is an active campaign to curtail the impending rise in BCH value.
Everyone who is anyone knows Roger is a jackass. But opinion talks and money walks.
You are not doing BTC's value any good by doing this.

Cyrpto currency has a huge ecosystem, Bitcoin is just in a bubble. (A long lasting probably not going to pop any time soon bubble) 
Any business that has already implemented Bitcoin and understands how it did it can simply add more wallets at a moments notice.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:31:44
I still feel like this moment it went up way to fast. I'm still calling a dump soon. Either that or this is people being butthurt over BCH and this is some kind of value war. Which I completely did not expect.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:44:14
I request that you add a current trajectory variable. so aggregate the current trajectory to show how long until it reaches the following amounts.
So the 7500 would have a in "30 days at current trajectory"
Then if you really want bonus points, allow people to input how many coins they have. So if someone has 5 coins it shows everything based on that instead.
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:03:21
Why do people keep thinking this? There is a point where people who want to invest will have more to gain from a coin that starts at 1 dollar and goes to 2 dollars than if they buy a tiny fraction of 1 coin that may go above 10k early next year.
BTC is being out performed to hell and back right now for the average Joe. BTC IS GOING TO SLOW DOWN. Not everyone has an extra 10 grand floating around for a marginal gain.
10 grand in almost any other major alt coin is likely to pay off a lot more.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:59:34
We may be looking at a lot of insanity with BTC and BCH. Once people realize you can dump in one coin to cause a rise in the other its like infinite coins to whoever sets it into motion. if you do buy in right now be mindful that things have a potential to go insane.
This isnt FUD because if you watch for this and if it actually does begin you wont have to worry as you can just ride it with everyone else.
If you don't believe me, look at the exchanges. when one coin dives or rises the other does the opposite. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:37:03
during peak times you will often have to wait hours for a transaction to go through then. It can even take 24 hours.
Bitcoin is a microtransaction shitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-17 05:47:45
ah I see, if you get salty enough a "fuck you" hard fork would be an effective tool though. No lie.
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:16:03
I was wrong when. Take a look at 2:30 AM last night. Compare that between BTC and BCH. Perfect correlation.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:08:01


Here is the counter argument to this point.
BTC is even worse than BCH when compared to other coins. You are unwittingly making the argument that BTC DOES need to be replaced with another coin. 
This entire point takes the whole debate and says : "BTC kind of sucks, wouldn't it be better from a technology perspective if etherium or Dash or lightcoin where the dominant coin?"
One problem with that though. A lot more people already have BTC and subsequently BCH.
BCH is the better of the two coins that is currently held by everyone who has ever owned BTC. BCH is the only other option that wouldn't destroy the crypto economy.
Do you have any idea how unfair it would be to rip the rug out from under EVERYONE just in the name establishing a coin that actually deserves to be the dominant choice?
Stop using this argument.

ha! it will be deflated to hell and back within 1 week.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:05:47
I don't know if you can consider something a bubble unless you know the actual value of the good. We wont know the final value of the coin until we observe it reach peak adoption. At that point it will be possible to determine if its above or below its actual value.
My personal guess is highly under valued right now to a point that people will hark back to when it was below 10k like that was super cheap.
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:47:36
Woah such an amazing deal!
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:46:43
Whatever, as it is right now, the high fees and slow speed are pressing matters that need to be addressed. Otherwise we will be stuck in this cycle forever.
If you think its bad now wait for BTG to jump into the mess as "the one and only bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:55:52
BTC is not going to die, this is just the next episode of "muh Money!" stay tuned for it recover back to 9k a week later.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:39:45
Also if you hold BCH and pretend it doesn't exist it slows down the pump and dump prospects.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:08:23
Its going to hit somewhere between 7000-8000 and then something super spooky is going to happen again which will drive the price back down to 5k ~
Then it will push back up to around 10k before it happens again. Its getting pretty predictable at this point. The reason I say this is because its happened over and over and over again.
What will be interesting is what will cause the dip that will happen. We already did the big bank guy calling bitcoin a fraud. China is getting fucking old, they are irrelevant as far as I can tell. My guess is the plot this time will be a potential US government might pass super spooky legislation!!
The price will drop to 5k and it will bring out a bunch of "I told you bitcoin was fake" people. Then it will climb up to 9k in a few months after that.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:09:43
I'm talking about principles. You can do what you want to muddy the waters but cheaper and faster is always better. Its never worse.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:50:42


This argument can and probably has been used on every major branch of technological advancement. When I read this I am reading argument against the internet. I am reading an argument against the selling of or ownership of digital goods. I am reading an argument about how its bad to take power away from the legacy media.
"Photographs taken with digital cameras are not real photography. If you cant hold the photo in your hands then you cant really have ownership of it. And thus it has no real value."
I get what a lot of you guys with these counter arguments are doing. You are properly question a new idea. However, I strongly suggest you keep in mind that this is not a new phenomenon.

@_date: 2017-11-13 00:14:44
BTC transaction takes an hour +
BCH has taken about 5 minutes tops.
You are saying that the larger block size has no influence on this?
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:00:36
BCH is rising. BTC will stay leveled out or it will go down.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:00:40


Yeah, everyone knows the morality of your leader determines who comes out on top every time.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:41:19
Yo homie, your brain ain't working if you think slow and expensive is better than what LTC or many other alt coins can provide. Objectively speaking BTC's main feature set is its bubble, the technology is lagging behind on every other front.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:50:44
Right, I believe that we are entering an age of high stress propaganda campaigns. Its going to be like an election cycle every day.

We have to get the next generation into bitcoin. To do this we need to make it easy for kids to get their hands on crypto currency and be able to use it to buy games on Steam. We need them to get addicted to having a wallet and spending the coins. Then "it" will begin.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:30:10
I hope I will still be on here. I might be ditching reddit for steemit by then.
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:59:13


It needs to be tied to the technology or you willfully admit your sitting on a bubble. The brand is meaningless if it gets called into question. Its a double edge sword.
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:16:17
And gold too.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:23:30
Also, while larger blocks are harder to mine. The Halving has the same effect. BTC is also designed to have centrality. Which isn't really centrality. Its just harder to mine. Anyone can still do it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:49:37
Higher the price the bigger the crash I think is what he's talking about. The first attack was a pump and dump to get a huge amount of btc. The price of BTC rises as BCH falls them boom.
Welcome to the wrold of unlimited pump!
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:29:33
For years
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:50:29


Its interesting that with all of this money. All of these people invested. Not one of them was willing to change a variable from 1 to 8 to modify the block size thus preventing this entire situation from happening.
I mean, if this was a shareholder meeting. Some heads would be rolling right now. There would be some nice lawsuits.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:40:26
The dip is over as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:26:17
BCH may have also forced someone to prototype the lightning network today rather than have all of us wait 18 months from now.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:09:49
When selling BTC for BCH the difference was super noticeable. BCH is way faster and WAY cheaper.
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:53:47
Actually, its going to take a bit longer this pump. BTC is going to slow down until BCH is stomped. There will be at least one more huge spike pump and slower and slower recoveries. 
Sorry Vegeta, maybe not even next month. I say 9k in January and it will be like climbing a mountain.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:28:59
I don't think it will drop as low as 60k from 100k, but yeah, this is pretty much it.
I feel a lot like this is manipulation because of how predictable it is. Think about it from the perspective of what Elon Musk often says. You are most likely to get what you most incentivise. 
Right now the incentive is to constantly inflate with mini pump and dumps. This process can go for a decade before it gets interrupted. This is WHY its so predictable right now. People figured out the pattern to game the system.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:57:10
this sounds like it could cause more panic if it happened during a chaotic event.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:58:04
Sometimes you have to make moves for political reasons.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:34:51
I have to agree, this is another situation.
I feel like both coins are going to be in constant battle with each other.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:53:19
Probably because you didn't notice when it happened. At least EA asks you first.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:52:14
I don't think the attack is going to go away until BCH is rendered inferior in terms of its feature set. That is pretty much it. I think this is going to keep going until something solid is actually done.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:01:27
Just look at the first BCH attack and compare the times. 
Notice that the dip and the spike are nearly identical. That is a vector of attack.
If someone uses enough of one coin that person can cause a dip in the other.
70 million dollar buy wall is now up by Roger Ver.
This will cause a massive unlimited pump on BCH that will cause a crash in BTC which is dependent on the value of BTC.
Honestly, I don't think most people even realize the severity of the situation. And who knows maybe I am just crazy. But that 70m buy wall might as well be infinite money because all it has to do is be enough to recoup losses reload and repeat.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:20:21
Well, my problem is people like you providing weak "faster and cheaper doesn't matter" arguments into an ideological battle.
Do you realize that in a debate, bringing a weak argument like that to the table is basically identical to being a proponent of the other side? I keep seeing these weak ass arguments in favor of BTC. Its either "being able to use the coin doesnt matter" or "R.ver might be out for his own interests GASP!!" It gives me so little faith in the future of the coin.
You might as well sell all of your btc for BCH now if the best you can do is that "cheaper and faster is irrelevant."
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:02:11
Early next year. And BCH will be what slows it down. 10k will be even slower.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:40:13
something fun to pay attention to is that BCH does the opposite of bitcoin. One goes up the other goes down.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:58:46
I have to say that, if you are working with small amounts like 100-1000 dollars you should be looking at an alt coin for long term HODL. Bitcoin will be out performed by alts most of the time when you are getting in with such small amounts. 
I understand BTC has a lot of value but if you put in 100 bucks now you are not going to make very much in a year vs 100 bucks in something else where you are able to garner a larger amount with a small investment.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:31:58
Oh cool we got the Wall Street Journal defending BTC now too?...
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:26:17
hmm a USD coin forked off of something would be kinda interesting and .. Rest in peace whatever coin it was forked from.

First off, unless you know what you are doing this can be super high risk. Just wait for an attack like the last one then gobble up the coins when its low then dump before everyone else does rinse and repeat.
But who knows maybe I am just crazy. The thing is, it all adds up. I think this is going to be how it goes down. If the fork gave everyone an equal number of coins, and the exchanges force everyone to buy and sell with BTC / BCH then its a feedback loop.
If you want to deal with this kind of thing then holy crap now is a good time to buy. Thing is I am seeing some strange stuff going on already.

So, is that big green wall part of the down trend? hahaha
Also the double standards right now. I remember when BTC was at 1500~ and everyone was like "To the moon!" but when BCH out performs BTC dramatically its like "BCH is dead!"
I honestly thought BCH was dead after I saw the lightning wallet thing. That was my tap out.
But umm
Its fucking not, and this will be disruptive for BTC.

Keep in mind that at around 6950 its going to drop again. This happens every time.

I'm not associated with either side. I just find this situation really fascinating. The infinite pump and dump would be the most amazing ride ever.
I want it to happen. I want to make all of that free money and hop off both coins to something else if I so desire. The only losers right now will be the partisan hacks.

You need two things. You need higher adoption values. The more people who have and use the coin the less it will fluctuate.
The more people who are aware of mini pump and dumps that go on will make it less profitable for fewer and fewer people. Right now its basically free money, and the more people realize how to get in on the action the smaller the profits will be. It will be essentially "Ruined by normies" as they say.

Is it? I see a ton of alt coins more deserving of the crown right now in terms of technical development. Everyone says LTC is the better version BCH use LTC instead. Well, LTC is kinda better than BTC too.
Ill tell you why they block size wasn't raised. Arrogance. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:42:13
Makes sense outside of the fact that we might be looking at BTC down in the 6ks again tonight.

Even before it went up 50% you would have been on like 40 grand right? Some big ass number for a 1000 USD investment.
Even if you just look at BCH right now. If you dumped all of your BTC for BCH at 300 bucks a pop. BTC would would be complete joke in gains compared to BTC.

I have observed this pattern since I got into bitcoin like 3 years ago. Its a cycle that has been on repeat ever since the first big crash. The first big crash when it went from 1300 to 100~ was the only time the pattern was not in place yet.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:17:42

I am seeing a lot more indications now that we can expect the ultimate pump spiral in crypto history. A lot of people who are dumping down the value of BTC are unwittingly providing cheaper and cheaper ammo to blow BTC up with. If the price gets even lower, like 800 or so then the next pump will be insane.

What is suspicious to me right now is that I got -40 down votes for saying something that is highly likely to occur. I don't think BTC is going to reach 9k "soon" and its because of this kind of stuff going on right now.
BTC will either stay where it is right now or it will go down. And I was downvoted.
THAT is suspicious, that is really suspicious.

@_date: 2017-11-05 23:26:31
the growth will stop when adoption reaches its peak. Due to the fact that the coin is still very niche then adoption will continue to grow. The price will get more attention, which causes more adoption, which causes the value to go up. 
Its a value virus.

You unwittingly walked into an ideological battle and went to the red team (Bitcoin) and asked a blue team (BCH) question.
r/BTC is more likely to answer question if nobody does here. If I knew the answer I would have answered.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:27:39
Its not the big thing you should be looking at.
BCH is officially a ball and chain on BTC. BTC has to work harder and harder to keep going up. While BCH gets to ride its coat tails on easy mode. ANd the moment you get any actual FUD about the coin, which always happens eventually, BTC will fall a little further each time and each time it will be just a little bit tougher to recover as well.
And at any moment someone can grab that ball and chain and throw it too. lol
Its all contingent on the value of BCH, the more it goes up the slower and more lethargic BTC will be.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:26:41
Yeah I used to think this, last weekend is an example of why free forked coins should just sit there. Add their value to your BTC value to make it look like you already went above 10k
@_date: 2017-04-20 01:22:36




No, You need to hold the employer responsible. They need to create a special wallet and the wallet automatically functions as it is meant to. It simply takes out the percentage when anyone places money into the wallet. In this case every pay check. The Employee can then empty the wallet to a private wallet and they can then do everything as they wish with it as normal.


Not only that but people doing contract work and even those who are self employed can look forward to tax returns every year rather than having to pay a huge sum. If you funnel all earnings through this wallet then everything will be handled automatically.
FOR ANYONE WHO HAS EVER DEALT WITH THE HELL OF SELF EMPLOYMENT OR CONTRACT WORK... This probably sounds like it add years to your life. I would do this in a damn heartbeat...

I say this all the time, the strongest aspect of crypto currency is how it can easily be integrated with bigger systems. Rewarding people with tokens that hold monetary value like gold has a ton of potential.
A fiat crypto can be very useful as it allows the state to dynamically integrate socialized programs that do not meddle with the free market. For example, paying people to do things like clean the streets. Its also possibly the best vector for a government mandated UBI.
We should have state or government crypto currencies. As long as they don't meddle with other crypto currency the idea is welcome in my opinion.

Oh no doubt that this is the case. But if they continue to do this over and over again then it will cause the coin to continue to increase in value over time. It will also cause more trust in the market as people are a lot more likely to want in if they see the big boys using the currency.
HODLers will benefit over the long term. And if enough people mimic JP morgans actions it will cause a stabilizing effect as adoption continues to increase.
I don't get what the problem is exactly? Were you living in some kind of fantasy universe where the big banks would not at least attempt to grow with the times?

One thing I can say is look at some hardware wallets like Keepkey and a few others. These wallets make the entire experience a lot easier to understand and your wallet can be on a physical object that will likely have instructions on how to do everything.

Its not confidence. Just look at the current trends right now. Is understanding Moore's law an act of confidence? What about the internet becoming popular? Did I have a vision into the future back in the 90s like I was some kind of super genius for expecting the internet to continue to grow?
The coin has been around since 2008. If it was going to be hit by hacking the shit would have happened by now.
I don't see this as confidence.


Ok you are back tracking I think now. You are framing this discussion as though we are talking about what has already transpired. 
I am talking about the future, the coin will be worth more than 5k in the next 6 months. I am about as certain as I am that hard drives available to the market will be larger in 6 months and the internet will continue to grow as well. The only thing that will slow or reverse the coins value will be adoption rates. If more people keep jumping on that means higher demand which means higher value.

@_date: 2017-10-13 04:43:16
Actually for fun, let me tell you something that I think does require confidence. We can come back to this post in a few months. 
The coin is going to continue to rise to a point where it starts to slow down a bit. This will be around 7000-8000 MAYBE 9000 but I am pretty sure its going to be in the 7000-8000 range. 
Within the next few months. Once it starts to slow down something super *spooky controversy* will happen! "Oh knows, super high up executive of super important thing will say super important scary information!"
The coin will drop back down to 3000-5000 range and sit there for a few weeks. "It will be the end of the coin forever!" Fire and brimstone for sure this time guys
Then it will climb past 10k... You want to know why I know this?
Because its happened like 8 fucking times ... and each time the end result is the damn coin climbs even higher. The above will play out exactly the same damn way. Its because people have figured out how to game the value of the coin. People with a ton of the coin can manipulate its value, probably until the end of time using this technique.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:15:04

To clarify, I mean the kinds of bubbles that cause nationwide destruction of capital. In the case of crypto currency you might get a bubble but the thousands of alt coins out there ease the chances of extreme excess. 
I don't even believe that bitcoin is a bubble. Bitcoins value is built to sit at around 1 million per coin.

@_date: 2017-10-12 06:50:04
Actually yeah, I could go into more detail but this very topic has had me pondering if I should take the risk to do this. I know what it would take to make a good game. I would need to figure out a way where the game's market would not become a pay to win model. So its highly likely that I would need to think out of the box.
But I do not know how hard it would be to make a new coin and integrated it into a game. I don't know how expensive it would be to hire X number of people who will know how to handle the creation and management of a new crypto currency.
But the game would be a Pay you to play model. I would likely follow a simple game design such as combining Realm of the mad god with Marble Madness. It would be top down and low system requirements. Its likely that it would focused on multiplayer PVE. You mine coins by playing the game. All transactions with NPCs would require these coins. I would also have a secondary progress gating system such as levels to prevent people with a lot of spare money to simply buy their way to being number one with no personal skill.
Realm of the mad god is permadeath. This means that players who die will likely drop their money in some way.
But yes, I fully intend to explore this in the future, if I can get my feet on the ground as an indie dev in the next month expect to see me exploring ideas around the "pay you to play" style gaming.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:19:47
Didn't help with a bunch of big wigs decided to slander the coin so they can buy in themselves. Well, I guess in a way that did kind of help, once it was obvious they were buying in themselves at the lower price a lot of people took that as a sign they should as well.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:36:20


Its more complex than this. Bitcoin is a technology that can be integrated into new systems that can become a decentralized form of basic income.

If I recall correctly, JP Morgan seems to have purchased a hundred thousand bitcoins recently. If it wasn't Jp Morgan it was someone with a lot of money sitting around.
With that said, bitcoin should be thought of as the automation of the banking establishment. We could theoretically simply stop using banks entirely right now using the technology. That's a lot of jobs that will be cut.

I wish this was the first response rather than "You guys come off desperate".
The value of crypto currency is very much an example of occultism. However, this can be said for the value of gold and silver as well. The idea that value is driven purely by supply and demand is not always accurate because it is often the IDEA that something is worth something that also drives its value. 
If Fort Knox where to dump its gold within a short period not only would it devalue the ore greatly it would likely take a long time as the demand for that much gold is probably not high enough.

I disagree completely with this assessment. This example is easily debunked. No it wasn't. 
Diablo 3 was a 60 dollar game that was setup in such a way where it encouraged / forced people to use the auction house which required real world money. That completely destroyed the entire core purpose of the game in the first place. They made it so one of the most important aspects of franchise was greatly reduced, that is, organically obtaining cool loot in regular intervals. That removed the very dopamine drip that made the entire series so addicting and replaced it with a real money auction house for micro transactions. It was a horrible design and poorly implemented concept that tugged at the very strings that made the game fun in the first place.
If a game is designed this way, it has to be designed carefully. You cant slap a system into an already existing game that undermines the entire games core focus. World of Warcraft is another example of this actually, its only common sense that by adding in a feature like this you would tether the value of in game currency to the USD. Which means the average player would only be making a few pennies an hour.
But if the game is designed in a way where it is a meritocracy and the top players are the ones rewarded the most then botting will become a lot harder to accomplish. The game NEEDs to be designed from the ground up with this concept at its core. You cannot slap this kind of design into an existing game without tethering in game currency to the USD.

If the number of people using the coin continues to grow then the value will also continue to grow. So it will definitely be worth more in 6 months. It will definitely be worth more in 5-10 years.
It has to reach peak adoption before we can safely see the value start to steady out.

Imagine a world where paying taxes simply was part of the currency algorithm. No more IRS, just use this currency and you are good to go. Man this would remove so many fucking headaches.
edit: Actually, why not just have government mandated wallets? The wallet can be associated with you and any pay checks or things that would normally be taxed are sent to this wallet. It can then withhold the correct amount automatically, then during tax season figure out how much I get back.
Hell all of the important information needed for my taxes could be part of the wallet itself. Holy fuck I would instantly take this over the nightmare that was being a self employed/contractor. That made my taxes a huge nightmare.

Yeah I was just looking at this after reading the last response. Pretty fucking awesome actually. In fact I half feel like the day when I dont even bother to have a bank account for keeping my money safe is getting to be a reality. 
Using a hardware wallet like this combined with a fireproof safe seems very secure. Keeping my passcode in a safe location isnt impossible either.
I might start looking into getting a fireproof safe and a wallet this week. How come I am just learning about this now.

I feel like the cat is out of the bag right now and people are all intensely waiting for the price to drop so they can buy more... It never had a chance to drop.
I was personally getting ready to buy after the halving because I was expect a huge price drop... I guess EVERYONE  was. Now all of these alt coins are gaining value too.
@_date: 2016-07-11 14:54:55
Are we seeing this happen right now with Brexit? If I understand, the value of the pound is going down, thus anyone with Bitcoin will in a sense be seeing a large increase on their return. Provided the decrease in value is influencing the cost of living.
@_date: 2016-07-27 20:47:31
I kind of feel like alt coins have completely sucked the wind out of a spike in value with Bitcoin after the halving. Since Alt coins are easier to mine than Bitcoin right now all you have to do is mine alt coins instead and use them to buy bitcoin and its like the halving never happened.
@_date: 2016-07-18 17:00:43


That's pretty cool! I want a debit card I can use everywhere that is backed by bitcoin! How do I set that up actually?

@_date: 2017-06-20 17:43:55
I was thinking about this some more. If you use the fact that a game item doesn't technically belong to the user because the devs can delete the item at any time you run into a weird loophole.
I believe Ethereum currently has functionality where the owners can delete / Invalidate coins if they believe the coins are fake. All it would take is the existence of the functionality to control the coins to make them basically identical to game assets. Game assets are also almost never deleted either but the functionality usually does exist to delete or modify them at any time.
On that same coin, if a developer creates an item worth a lot of real world money the devs are able to profit off that item if they so wish. So the devs might need to be held accountable for the digital assets they create.

Actually, The main thing going on here is complete and total ignorance of the topic. (not you but the powers that be)
Crypto is ultra complicated and confusing. A lot of the oligarchs right now appear to be absolutely confused how the internet works let alone how something like crypto works. 


By then it will already be too late. The way to make new currency is open source. everyone has access to it. There is no ownership of the technology in terms of its functionality. The value of a coin will be tied inextricably to its open source nature. Touch that and the coin becomes worthless and some new coin takes its place.
I seriously believe that the powers that be right now simply dont grasp what is really happening.
Technology acts as a type ideological enforcement that people will adopt without understanding the overall effects. Imagine the borg from Star Trek, now imagine the borg as being an intangible entity promoting a host of concepts all of which act as invisible hand. 
When someone makes a Facebook account they have added their identity to the collective. Can you imagine a world without Twitter or youtube at this point? How about reddit? Take each technology that is being worked on right now and view it through the lense of ideology. You will see capitalism, libertarian, anarchy, socialism inextricably thrown into the mix.
If they understood any of this on any level at all they would have made damn sure to heavily regulate ISPs back in the 90s. If there really is an Illuminati they have already signed their own fate. I never really believed in that kind of stuff. The powers that be are just as much a part of the collective as the rest of us.

I view it as the first steps toward making real life work like a video game. I know it sounds strange but its really the case. We have coins being heavily integrated into systems like Steemit for example. 
Its reward systems, for posting on social networking. Its rewarding people for mining coins or gambling. Its rewarding people for watching the market and buying low and selling high. Its rewarding people for recognizing who the whales are.
Everyone talks about the future utopia where automation turns our lives into a existence of leisure. But I know the truth. We have an open world PVP centric political system where everything goes. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:48:24
I think that gaming profit models that work a lot like Steemit will eventually become a thing. So instead of pay to play or Free to play, the game itself will pay you to play it. Then the devs simply have access a stockpile of the currency and maybe a way to collect more through in game transactions. This amazing concept could be completely ruined by forcing the players to have to report earnings to the government. 
On top of that, Money in Steemit is tied up in steam power, does that count as taxable income? Also I can break the tos on a video game but if the devs simply don't enforce it then that creates a tax haven. So make a pay you to play game then put in the tos that its against the tos to sell the currency for real money. That technically means I can still sell it for BTC but goes around the tax law.
Crypto is not really a taxable asset. It can potentially drop to zero value as I am reporting it to the government and end up owing money I don't have. I honestly think the only way to handle this fairly is for the IRS to hand out wallets And the IRS would then need a completely new system to handle how to take taxes out.
Or we can just do the smart thing and only tax when crypto is converted to USD. It might mean the government will have less taxes to work with though but its the only moral way to handle the situation. Once you start going down this path of regulating the unregulatable its going to lead to bloodshed.

They need to be careful about this. Its perfectly logical that if you cash out then you will pay taxes on that amount. But if people start to thinking of cashing out as just losing 30% of your money then it will mean fewer people will cash out. When in reality its the most ideal way to handle the situation.
However, if the IRS begins having fits and punishing the honest people who cash out then cashing out wont just be viewed as losing 30% but also putting yourself at great personal risk. If people start to refuse to cash out in fear then it will spiral into literally not cashing out as a form of self preservation simply nobody will mingle with fiat anymore.
I am going to have to start seriously thinking about deleting my posts on this topic XD

The letter of the law might say this but in this case its not a good idea to take action even if they have the ability to do so. It would be extremely short sighted to attempt to enforce this. For starters it would simply make people not report anything unless they absolutely have to and its also not enforceable anyway.

Do you have a Steemit account? you should probably post this over there. Ill give you an upvote.
edit: On that note I think that it might be wise that anyone who has done work on a crypto currency or has contributed to the community be extra careful. The reason is that my gut says that when they find out that they cant control the technology they will start breaking the legs of the humans who created it.

@_date: 2017-06-23 20:32:46


Ultimately, we will have to answer a question about how different bitcoin really is from gold in World of Warcraft. We are more than training ourselves, we are setting up for a great debate on what taxable income will have to include when it comes to digital goods. 
Do you owe taxes on those likes you got on a Facebook post?
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:58:55


That's not how digital game assets work. If I obtain an item by slaying so MOB in a video game that item belongs to me and holds innate value. That value can at any time be traded for real money. What if that item IS crypto currency? How do you define the difference between one digital good vs another? And how do you define exactly what qualifies random number generation? So its ok for me to give a bitcoin to someone if its through random number generation?
Once people start to see a crackdown the government will have blown its wad, its going to basically be a crackdown on all digital goods, all applications, all digital services.
