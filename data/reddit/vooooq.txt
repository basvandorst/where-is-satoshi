You have few hundreds from zillions of dollars in your pocket.
I have few hundreds from 21 millions of bitcoins in my wallet.
Both of us enjoy this. :)))

Wait! What about "Bitcoin is a fast, cheap payment system"?
I payed 60 cents for a 8kb transaction 2 hours ago, and still 0 confirmations.
What will be if billions of people would like to use bitcoin?
Waiting for days, and 100-200$ fees?
