Here's my stab at 
* 1) Teach some one you know (friend/relative) about bitcoin and tip them their first bitcoin 
* 2) Get a musical artist/band to accept bitcoin as payment for their music
* 3) Run a bitcoin node to support the network
* 4) Make a visual graphic explaining bitcoin in the most simplest terms you can think of 
* 5) Get a local store/vendor to accept bitcoin by taking time and teaching them the in's and out's 
* 6) Host a local bitcoin introduction class/seminar 
* 7) Hand out bitcoin flyers at a local University
* 8) Get a charity to accept bitcoin for donations 
* 9) Make a song/video/parody about bitcoin
* 10) Try and live entirely off only using bitcoin to purchase things for a week

What about a service like Gyft? If I send some bitcoin to someone in Greece or Argentina cant they use Gyft to convert and use at over 200 retailers? You can basically buy anything that way (food, clothing, etc..)

Yea, looks like your right, I just dug this up myself: 
(R20) NACHA Definition:
The ACH entry destined for a non-transaction account, as defined in Regulation D, would include either an account against which transactions are prohibited or limited or a pass-through where the entry is for a credit union or thrift organization and Regulation E descriptive requirements cannot be met.
What it Means:
The bank account you entered cannot be used for ACH Payments.
What to Do:
Contact your customer to obtain authorization to charge a different bank account. (Be certain that your customer confirms the account is enabled for ACH transactions.) Or, ask for a different form of payment.

Since I don't currently have a bank account I got a Amex BlueBird card, which acts like a checking account, even providing a routing number. I'm waiting on that verification to go through, hopefully it works. Could benefit a lot of people without accounts. Do you need a credit card if your banking was verified? Or can you still purchase without one? 
I am also in the same boat, I have a MasterCard and they only take Visa right now, hopefully they will add other cards by the spring/summer.

Hi xx ,
Unfortunately, it looks like we couldn't verify your bank account. Please see the reason we received from your bank below:
Bank Account:	 *********2565
Routing Number:	xxxxxx
Failure Reason:	Non Transaction Account (R20)
You may want to double check the account number and routing number, and try again. For now, we've removed this bank from your account.
Best of luck and thank you for using Coinbase.
Kind regards,

They do look similar. I saw that site after I had already purchased mine. They are also based in Canada. I was a little worried at first and even emailed them to see if they shipped it and they got back to me pretty quickly. It came a week after. The only thing I wouldn't buy is the cold storage card. I don't believe anyone has a secure method at this point when it comes to cards.

So anything with dedicated and passionate followers are considered "cult members" now? 
I understand you may not like Bitcoin or the people who promote it, but you just can't expect to go into a Bitcoin forum and talk mostly negatively about it and think people will take it kindly. Most of the people here are fans. Try and go to an apple or android subreddit and express negative views, I'm sure you would get the same outcome. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 02:58:52

@_date: 2014-01-08 03:34:23
The reason I used BlueBird was because of the fact they offered a routing number. Not sure if any other cards do. 
The credit card is the only thing I have left to verify. I have a MasterCard, which hopefully they will accept soon.

I don't see why they would. You have to preload all these accounts with money, so there's really no risk of a scam for them. 
This is only my opinion, hopefully they don't. This could help a lot of new users come into the market.

They really need to make cold storage easier to do. The process for one to do it themselves is a little too complicated.

I wonder which NFL team will be the first to accept bitcoin for tickets and merch? 
Being a Giants fan and from NY, I hope it's them. Doubt it though. I can see a team like San Francisco or San Diego being one of the first.

"There are several ways to get Bitcoins, but the easiest is to exchange them for currency at your bank or a Bitcoin exchange." 
That has got to be changed. Banks will not convert your money to Bitcoin.

I'm actually trying to get my cousin who is in Argentina into Bitcoin. Does anyone know of a "How to" or "Bitcoin Guide" but in spanish? 
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:44:42
Mind blown. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 18:05:00
I would def be interested! 
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:05:15
I would love to have this app. If I can track more crypto than btc, even better. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 06:31:00
You won't need to sell them at $10K, you'll be able to use it anywhere at that point. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 23:31:38
Yea, his tracks are wav files that he edits in protools. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 23:10:17
Thank you for clearing that up! 
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:18:28
We will only see with time. If consensus adopts the BTC Classic fork it will be a good step in the right direction. Hearn did shed light on topics that are important and should not just be brushed aside as only said out of anger, there is some truth to his parting words. One thing is for sure, no one can claim bitcoin is done or failed, that's the great thing about bitcoin, its not just about one person.  
@_date: 2016-03-10 20:39:54
So basically, a book about making money off shitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 23:01:07
seems legit. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:43:17
One does not simply go full bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-26 00:02:59
Its pretty simple lol 
@_date: 2016-01-23 03:45:45
I recommend getting a Trezor  
It's cheap and a trusted hardware wallet. Only downside is its Cold Storage, not Cool. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:52:52
They aren't taking over bitcoin, they are just going to create their own private blockchains. 
@_date: 2016-03-10 21:58:39
I'm not saying all coins are "shitcoins" but the majority sadly are. I've been trading altcoins for a bit now and have even worked alongside doing graphics for people creating coins, unfortunately most is just hype to get people to buy and dump on. There are a few exceptions for me though, I do like what Counterparty and Bitshares are doing. Maybe I've heard the "great devs, great community, this coin will change things!" one too many times. However, I will agree that yes, you can make money trading the right "shitcoins". 
@_date: 2016-03-28 18:04:33
I was trying to make a decision on which to use over the weekend. 
It was either buy instant using a debit card with Circle but at a $5 hike against the current price of BTC or use Coinbase and buy at current price with a .20 cent fee but wait 6 days to receive my BTC. 
I ended up not using either and just holding off buying. I'm hoping Coinbase will let more users use the instant buy feature with a debit card (something I emailed them about and was told certain accounts are slowly getting this feature.)

Edit: I uploaded this picture now into Deep Dream. I'm curious to see what happens. Dream within a dream?

I feel like a lot of this could be put to rest if Satoshi joined the conversation. I would be curious to see how much his opinion would have impact on others. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:15:20
If a big player in the space scoops them up it could be good news...which will make the price tank.

Primecoin ((XPM)) 
@_date: 2013-12-30 03:36:40
I've recently starting using CryptoThrift.com and have had no problems. They could use a site re-design, but they have a pretty good system and low fees.
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:24:49
Merry Christmas to you too! 
 made that :) 
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:28:42
Andreas is so full of information and easy to listen to and understand. A truly genius guy and leader in the Bitcoin Community! 
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:14:21
If you are going to be keeping a large amount on the exchange I would suggest also having an offline wallet, in case of hacks or security breaches. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:26:07
Bitcoin has recently been at $500-$800 range. A month ago it was at $1200. 
whoa...irony. The  almost match. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 23:06:01
How can we make this game without breaking any copyright laws? This would actually be fun to play online against people, maybe wager real btc against opponents. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:37:24
Cool, I'll try it out and post my iphone on there. 5% seems a bit high though on their end no? 
@_date: 2013-12-27 05:38:58
I wish they took Karma Koin cards, I'm stuck with $50 worth :/

Well, I work a 9-5 (decent), went to school for Audio Engineering, so mixing/mastering and making music is a love/hobby of mine. 
But recently I've found more inspiration and passion in crypto. 
Maybe start a Crypto Band? call ourselves "Bitallica?"
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:59:47
I would stick with Coinbase or find a trusted local dealer.
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:23:29
Also if your making profits, consider looking up your states tax requirements on Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:07:36
We'll yea, I hope that ideal world becomes reality! 
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:29:57
I know :) I cant even afford one BTC! I wish! 
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:18:26
Thanks! :) 
@_date: 2013-12-23 01:13:59
I didn't even know about that OTC site, thanks! 
Can't you just go to like 711 or CVS and get the prepaid card? Or are you trying to purchase one with BTC? Cause technically, if I buy one with cash, then send you the cc  how would I ever be tied to the cc, if I am buying it at a store with cash and never using it myself? 
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:34:28
That is true, I used "exchange" incorrectly. I feel its the safest place to start buying Bitcoin. Hopefully they add other crypto in the near future. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 18:03:14
Just whipped this one up, used ms paint and photoshop! 
Is there more then 1 entry allowed?

I believe I've heard Andreas Antonopoulos mention 6 billion are without bank accounts. He says it's his personal motto for Bitcoin, "The other 6 billion." 
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:14:04
Argentina is a prime example of a country that can make this happen. They're in financial turmoil, have access to 24 hr electricity, and have the current means of mobile access/use/network. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:08:28
Do they charge more than 2-3%? That's what my local seller is currently charging me. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:57:19
Andreas is the man! 
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:05:40
Awesome gift! 
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:25:58
It's not that I don't care, it's just all of my family is like old school Spanish and it's hard for me to really explain. I've been trying though, I'm trying to help out my cousin in Argentina, getting info about it that I can find that's translated to him, the money situation is terrible there. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:39:06
hahaha sometimes I feel like it does it on purpose, just to fuck with me!

Have you tried cryptothrift? 
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:03:31
Subscribed. Guys got a great thing going on over there! Thanks for the BTC as well! &lt;3 
Go sign up guys! 
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:24:36
I was just asking because most people that are into Bitcoin also are into other altcoins. My bad! 
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:35:36
They could buy the Bitcoin from local sellers or miners. This article explains more:

Hope everyone has a great day and gets lots of presents! 
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:13:45

@_date: 2013-12-23 03:45:56
Cryptothrift says they charge 1% for escrow, does that mean, they take 1% off the final sale? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:46:40
Awesome, I'm working on one right now but drawing it, I'm better with my hands! 
@_date: 2013-12-29 19:07:55
Oh Paul...
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:16:46
It crashed almost 50% in value. It's just now recovering back to $800. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:07:45
Also, have any of you guys thought about using the AMEX BlueBird as a "bank account?" They provide a routing number and everything. Going to try it out myself tonight after work. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:07:36
This is great guys! Good job! Def will be using this! 
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:03:11
I'm guessing the problem would be trusting the seller to send the merch and the buyer to send the BTC....
Cryptothirft claims to act as a middle man holding the BTC, but can you trust that they will keep your BTC free of attacks or just wont take off with them? 
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:57:38
Yup 
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:25:05
I would would say your friend could make a wallet on his PC and then you send him his share, or you create another wallet on your pc and send his share to that one. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:15:48
Umm...I'll take Bitcoin as a gift. If anyone ever gives you Bitcoins, disown them, then send them to me. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:27:31
Also my cousin mailed me this Koin card from Florida, I tried to explain it a bit to her over the phone because she's younger and bi-lingual. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:37:42
Yea, I was thinking a simple solution for the moment...
There's no scripts or anything out there that does this for pools? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:28:58
I've been on others but r/Bitcoin is by far the best.
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:18:17
You could always find someone willing to go out and buy a prepaid card and then send you the info? I would be willing to do for BTC but I would need to make sure you were legit as fuck first! 
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:09:38
 Is the only exchange I feel comfortable trading on. Being US based and they recently got a $25M investment cant hurt...
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:43:16
whats a bitocoin? lol 
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:25:49
Yea, makes sense to I guess. I already have xpm too so, might as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:09:10
Primecoin is a sub of Peercoin no? SunnyKing?
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:50:59
Just tried out just-dice.com pretty thrilling I must say! 
Are there any sites that do Bitcoin Roulette?
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:20:24
no problem! 
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:57:02
I mean, keep most in your offline wallet and keep a small amount on the exchanges. In case of a security breach you don't lose all your coins. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:36:27
Whelp, there goes my Christmas! 
Will be working on this today! 
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:46:26
I wish I could take this obsession and put it to good use! 
I've been spreading the word about BTC, sold some stuff on Cryptothrift, bought a flight to FL in BTC, and do random Bitcoin/Altcoin graphics for fun. 
I'm just excited and passionate about this new technology!
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:16:30
Its pretty safe to use, but I would follow the steps on their site to make sure your keys &amp; wallet are 100% secure. Offline printing, etc...
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:14:33
so would that mean the price for 1 would go up if its added? its currently at around $32. So I could get 1 coin.
@_date: 2013-12-26 17:52:38
I'm going to try it out with Blue Bird. 
To answer your question, I don't currently have a bank account because xbox live was charging me every month without my consent and it overdrafts my account by $75, by the time I was done fighting it and payed the fee to avoid collections, they had closed my account. I haven't gotten another one because I'm sure I would come up in a history check at another bank. I have a friend at Citi who said they could help me out but I heard about Blue Bird and their $0 fees and no minimum monthly balance. Also with the stories I'm hearing about accounts being frozen because of Bitcoin purchases, I figure Blue Bird might be less likely to do so. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 00:57:12
I have bought Bitcoin before by purchasing a visa debit card, adding the funds to google wallet and then sending payment to a trusted local vender. 
I'm a legit human (non-scammer) so I wouldn't mind, but I would need at least a license picture with name/address or something to verify you wont scam me lol 
pretty much a circle jerk. Though I have offered to skype with people and stuff if they feel more comfortable and secure that way. Just throwing some ideas out there! 
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:56:06
I would imagine that if I held so much money in Bitcoin that instead of cashing out, I would just buy everything with Bitcoin. That's the ideal goal of Bitcoin no? 
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:07:57
I currently have $1.07 in Bitcoin (lol) 6.5 Primecoin and 0 Litecoin
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:19:14
So then put the $50 towards BTC then huh? I figure I can put some towards getting 1 coin whenever I have some spare $ :/
@_date: 2013-12-24 15:06:44
Most likely will sell it for btc or cash. I'm not giving anyone Btc, it would just be a lot of explaining and weird looks. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:27:25
I'm selling special custom Bitcoin sacks to put the money in if you do! 
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:03:22
people actually tip? 
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:09:59
I like all the good things I've read about Primecoin, and they broke like 4 world records?
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:23:03
Its really all up to the IRS
Thats a good article explaining it. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:29:28
Hopefully they have good deals for customers paying with BTC 
@_date: 2013-12-24 07:02:38
Just wanted to wish everyone in the community a safe and Merry Christmas! Enjoy guys!
