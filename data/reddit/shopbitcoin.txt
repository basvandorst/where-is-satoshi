I had a Gox account but never got around to bothering with the laborious process required to fund with fiat to be able to trade. Hopefully SecondMarket will be an easier interface. On the other hand it turns out, in hindisght, that laborious Gox process saved me some money.

Good observation !
But it is from the article ..
@_date: 2014-09-17 21:32:20
Who is John Carley, is that you ? Why do emails to him not get actioned ?
@_date: 2014-04-22 01:43:12
Daily Mail is carrying it in the UK Tuesday .. 
Eat less, think more.
@_date: 2014-09-18 11:41:58
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:50:57
and eat them too ..
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:37:21
NY Post could regulate it .. or maybe the NSA ?
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:05:30
Will be there !
@_date: 2014-09-17 23:48:40
yes, and I've emailed this mysterious and evasive 'John Carley' .. each time I do I get a response saying "A representative will follow-up with you as soon as possible" ..
Since August 28 I've been waiting for 'a representative' to 'follow up' with me 'as soon as possible'
Bitcoin Trader is starting to stink up the joint, IMHO
@_date: 2014-02-16 00:38:12
$580 million... *$35 million. They sold it for $35 million ... you are right, even worse than I 'generously' painted it.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:36:12
we don't have that one .. 
if someone can send me an "I GOT GOXED" logo I will get some made up for you pronto !
btw we have a bunch of other cool ones @ 
@_date: 2014-03-16 12:23:27
you have a good point here .. one can imagine some of the VC funds pouring into Bitcoin will develop some transactional device that will speed up the process
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:53:31
Before you downvote this, read the full article .. and then upvote it .. do it.

When you or your parents bought the home you live in, was the mortgage provided in wheelbarrows of cash ?
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:30:44
Bitcoin is all about having skin in the game, it is not a spectator sport. So, buy some bitcoin. Feel it, live it. 
You will write authoritatively from that vantage.
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:01:47
Yeouch !
@_date: 2014-03-02 03:15:59
yes, seems fair, thanks
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:48:18
It's the weekend after a pretty rough Bitcoin week .. a bit of light-hearted fun, is all .. help spread the words Bitcoin is here to stay !
@_date: 2014-09-16 00:30:28
Are you with Bitcoin Trader ?
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:52:00
good answers here, including yours (&amp;mine) but you mention it can be used for much more that just payments .. what are you thinking about here ?
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:46:58
I was there last week .. impressive!
@_date: 2014-04-19 20:39:44
Unbelievable and shocking tale .. a cautionary one .. but shocking nonetheless ..
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:05:12
will work on that, thanks for the feedback
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:51:33
I wonder if there are funeral homes accepting Bitcoin yet ..
@_date: 2014-09-17 23:45:24
doubled in 3 months ? while the price of Bitcoin was falling ?
Maybe Bitcoin Trader is a Ponzi scheme where the early adopters cash out with unrealistic profits and the rest of us are left holding the bag !
My 'investment' is relatively nominal .. but what if there are 10,000 of accounts like mine stuck in 'Bitcoin Trader' hell ?
Is this the next Mt. Gox debacle ??
@_date: 2014-09-15 11:11:41
Try not to muddy the waters. There was no 'technical glitch or the like'. I simply want to cash out and I've been trying to do so for a month. Impossible. And my queries requesting this be done no longer get answered.
Maybe I've now lost what I 'invested' at Bitcoin Trader and I am reluctantly willing to chalk it up to the experience of learning the pros and cons of the Bitcoin environment.
Hence, a cautionary tale to others.
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:12:02
I'll accept it !
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:20:35
Time to pay it forward !
@_date: 2014-03-16 11:54:21
I spent a few extra moments behind a guy at the grocery checkout who insisted on fishing 93 cents out of his pockets to settle up on the nose. He even dumped his whole wallet out in front of us all and the 3 or 4 of us behind him waiting to pay had to wait for him to play out his ridiculour charade.
@_date: 2014-09-18 11:04:21
sorry to hear .. Gox, NeoBee .. and now Bitcoin Trader ?
@_date: 2014-09-18 01:08:19
Haven't been rude with BT at all, just been ignored .. and they seem to have stiffed me for both my principal and my profit, which is pretty rude, don't you think .. and the point of this thread.
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:10:08
good point .. but it shows it is in the mix at least 
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:09:13
CafePress doesn't, but I am happy to accept Bitcoin and do the conversion on this end .. figure out a fair conversion and let's do it !

A rapid disintermediated international transmittal technology unencumbered by geographic distances
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:57:37
interesting hypothesis .. not sure why anyone would downvote this thread, tho
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:06:54
as long as they don't eat bitcoiners .. like Gox seems to be doing ..  :)
@_date: 2014-03-16 12:05:11
In one fell swoop you are dismissing the global digital economy and the international monetary system, all of which is paperless. Who peed in your Corn Flakes this morning ?
@_date: 2014-09-18 00:42:59
nope, good try, but bullshit answer .. maybe you're with Bitcoin Trader 
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:14:08
Apologies, btcnr .. noob here .. that one didn't go up right away .. thought it was lost to the gods of reddit .. so posted here instead. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:49:36
Holy cow !
@_date: 2014-04-22 01:42:08
just checked  .. working fine for me right now
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:08:44
Wow, that's more than a quarter billion dollars .. how many pizza slices will that buy ?
@_date: 2014-05-03 16:44:38
Meh ..
@_date: 2014-09-18 00:02:57
why would you wait till the price moves up when you inexplicably doubled your money when the price moved down ?

I like it !
Stocks, I get .. but what do you mean by 'smart property and digital assets' ?

Looks like the Kraken are trying to drag this posting down into the abyss
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:03:25
Tell that to The Daily Mail .. it's their headline .. that's why I posted it here ..
@_date: 2014-02-16 00:40:08
And isn't Rupert Murdoch's company involved in that nasty 'phone hacking' mess in the UK ??
