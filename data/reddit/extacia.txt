At some point or another the money will be repatriated.  Transactions, i.e. bank deposits, in excess of $10,000 are reported to the IRS.  Sales transactions over $10,000 must be reported too -- in case someone was thinking about skirting reporting obligations by using Bitcoin to purchase gold bullion from Apmex or something.

To survive summary judgment there must be a genuine dispute as to a material fact. If there weren't, the case would be tossed without going to trial. No jury, no judge, out. The judge is just saying the case will survive summary judgment, i.e. there is a basis for the suit.

TBH it largely depends on the climate in which you live. Here in the Northeast, maybe you'll have a few days in the autumn and spring where you won't need heat because of the miners. And it will add to the net heat in the winter, but it will have the same effect in the summer too and will 
require more cooling. Small if not negligible gain IMO but depends on the climate.

Thank you. It's like typing up an e-mail, printing it out, stuffing the paper in an envelope, and dropping it in a mailbox. Completely defeats the purpose.

Actually, loaned is the past tense of loan. Lent is the past tense of lend. Loaned is proper here because Zhinkk borrowed a sum of money from his father.

To make it easy he could go with a payment processor? He never touches the Bitcoin and gets paid in USD. Easy.

Also that's a state taxation issue. Not every state has a sales tax. This is a federal issue.

The real issue is people abusing the returns. It's when the market takes a hit and people return the refrigerator they paid 1 BTC for and get 3 BTC back.

Structuring? There's something illegal about anonymizing your bitcoin? I'm seriously wondering what your question is. Are you asking whether using bitcoin tumblers is a separate offense aside from the crime someone committed?

"Wall Street" is referring to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This guy is trying to create a peer-to-peer securities exchange. Therefore making the NYSE obsolete.

Unfortunately, this will likely not offend the Dormant Commerce Clause because 1: Congress has not yet regulated in this area, and 2: This does not appear to unduly burden interstate commerce (the test which a court would use in this situation). The regulations appear to have a mostly intrastate effect, i.e. regulating NY businesses.

I see that you offer three types of mead. There's no info about any of them on the website. Can you tell us the difference between the three and about the brewing process?

It's quite possible that tumbling bitcoins would serve as evidence of money laundering. But tumbling seems legal if you simply want "clean" coin.

I used to use them before BTC spiked in value, never had a problem with them. Always paid fully and promptly (within a day). I hope it gets figured out!

Under the Commerce Clause, the federal government also has the ability to regulate home-grown marijuana for personal use that never enters the stream of commerce. But more importantly with interstate shipment, the other state (not CO) is going to be interested in that package.

It's technically 2FA but it isn't secure. A key logger that steals your Cryptsy password will also steal your email password, trust me. You need 2FA that utilizes an authentication process that will never touch your computer.

Don't incorporate, create an LLC instead. The corporate structure can be an absolute nightmare for a smaller operation, trust me. With an LLC, you can create pretty much any structure you can envision. Also, I'd suggest you enlist the help of a lawyer to draft an operating agreement. An attorney will also be able to help you with your other questions. What I assume you're getting at is whether this is legal in the USA. An attorney could answer that.
Edit: Along with indemnification (as you pointed out) there are other important considerations when deciding which entity to create. Taxation is probably second most important after indemnification.

If you're planning on using bitcoin as an investment vehicle you shouldn't. It's clear you know absolutely nothing about investing if you bought bitcoin one night and sold at 4am the next day when there was a market downswing. Stay away from bitcoin.

Corporations are legal constructions, and therefore you need to incorporate in some jurisdiction. You can "play" corporation and pretend you made one, but only you will be obligated to recognize the existence of the corporation.

Coinbase charges 1% fees. So it isn't any cheaper to buy every 14 days than daily. It isn't like a trading site that costs about $7 per trade. In that scenario it's most cost effective to bundle trades as much as possible. However, I don't fully understand Coinbase's "bank fee" but I think that's percentage-based too.

I'm glad I was able to go home for the holiday yesterday, it was the perfect opportunity to tell my family about bitcoin. Sometimes I spend too much time around here and forget that many people haven't heard about it. It's always fun spreading knowledge and talking about something that makes me sound tech savvy haha! I hope you had a great Thanksgiving and thanks for doing this for the community.

Can confirm, Capital One 360 worked just fine. The transaction even came across as Coinbase/BTC. Pretty obviously Bitcoin related. No fuss, funds were sent as I directed.
