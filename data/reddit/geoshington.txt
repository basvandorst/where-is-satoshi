Bitten by the Heroku outage -- see  CoinWorker was definitely unreachable for about 2 hours, then up-and-down for a bit. I can reach it now and new work is happening and old earnings are catching up, but it may still be choppy for a bit... Heroku hasn't yet given a definitive 'all clear'. 
You can follow  for official updates (even after this thread goes cold).

Please *don't* do anything that artificially makes yourself look like more than one worker. The task-providers want independent, good-faith answers from a variety of contributors. Repeating tasks subverts that goal.

The system is tuned for bulk jobs, not one-off bounties. But that's another good idea for a bitcoin-based service. (Escrow your reward, specify when/how it would be released.)

[CoinWorker.com]( registrations are open!

I've made this new service where anyone can earn bitcoin in a web browser. 
You enter your payment address, perform analytic tasks that a paying company needs completed, and receive bitcoin as a reward soon afterward. (In minutes, when all is working.)
You could think of it as mining with your own mind, rather than a specialized GPU.
Let me know what you think!

The tasks come via crowdsourcing company CrowdFlower, which does have an API for submitting tasks. See:

Unfortunately I have no way to predict arrival of future tasks, because so many different projects insert them on their own schedules. 
I have one slight indication that there may currently be a seasonal lull in overall volume/variety, so on the timeframe of months (rather than days) there's hope there will usually be more than recently.

Right. To create/hand-out tasks for others to do, you can work with CrowdFlower (see the link at the CoinWorker 'questions/help/faq' page). They're not bitcoin-specific, and can help scale tasks that will be sent to CoinWorker (and if you'd like other communities as well). 
But your poll idea has me thinking: maybe I should use the CrowdFlower API to inject some tasks for CoinWorker's own workers, polling them about future possibilities. "A penny for your thoughts..."

I've seen this too, and reported it via the top-right dropdown 'Help' -&gt; 'Give Feedback' link that appears while working on a task. Any sort of glitches like that inside task content can be reported that way, and if you include your 'Contributor ID' it will help that team investigate.

Because this comment sits atop the thread sorted by new, and gives a misleading impression, I should note that:
There have been plenty of tasks at CoinWorker for most of the past two months. Also, while some tasks occasionally have flaky assessment/qualification/training,  other tasks (or fixed versions of flaky tasks) are constantly arriving. A diligent contributor will usually find things to do.

At the beginning of the week, there was a task "Predict the Academy Awards". You could only do it once, and it promised small bonuses if the predictions turned out to be correct. 
So yes, polls are definitely a possibility!

The tasks displayed can vary by region. That's probably explains any differences in what's visible. Over time I expect more tasks to become available for non-US areas (and even non-English speakers).

That's been a common request and I'm considering a few options. 
One possibility is a global default threshold for quick payment.  Below that threshold, a balance would have to be 12-24 hours old to be paid. Above that threshold, it'd be paid immediately. 
Would that help, if it were something like 0.2 or 0.5 btc? 
The other option would be per-address preferences, which are a little tricky to implement with my no-registration system, but should be possible with some reasonable assumptions. Even with preferences, I would probably avoid holding balances more than 1-2 days. 
(The transaction fees aren't too bad because many workers' payments can be batched into the same transaction... but some workers seem to prefer fewer larger payments to keep their own mental model of their workflow less complicated.)

I agree it's odd that there's not a clearer indication when one task unit has finished -- that's a part of the tasks back-end I don't control. I'd guess it's been optimized for the expert worker, who just wants to keep moving forward. 
Tasks come via the crowdsourcing company CrowdFlower, and I believe the expertise of individual workers is tracked, allowing special offers to workers with reliable histories. See here for more details:
