The charlatans failed and only made money by breaking laws and causing unnecessary market churn.
In the end though, those people will be caught and put to justice.

I've kinda been transacting as usual myself. I sold my ETH for BTC, bought some things I wanted for myself with BTC so I could support some folks who entertain me, and I have about $5 left now. I've always had a tiny amount of BTC, numbering in Satoshis and I always have had faith in them. 
This network attack is nothing but a bunch of stupid entitled miners throwing a fit. The network backlog is just a mild inconvenience and a signal to HODL tight and wait for the rally back up in my view. Sucks, but that's how it goes. I've never paid a fee higher than 100sat/b ever and don't plan on starting to, I actually have paitence to wait for honest miners to "Get around to it". 
I really wish people would realize how much better BTC really is, and I respect all the HODLers myself. I do enjoy Dogecoin and Ethereum too though. But Only because I know them to be honest coins with an honest core to their community. While I may only gamble with Satoshis I can eke from a faucet, I'm no less a part of this. I do have lots of faith and look forward to a time when I can easily buy my BTC and use it proudly.

I'm already seeing that miners are spinning back up on BTC. Transactions are beginning to confirm and the graphs on  are starting to reflect this as things are slowly turning back. 
Hopefully these weak-minded miner operations have learned something about trying to capitalize on poorly thought out forks. Namely that BTC is king and to remain profitable they need to stick with us alone, not try to waste energy trying to improve something that's been deliberately balanced out and has been developed, tried and true over the years.

I feel like miners should never have left. I resisted this pump and I always have resisted high fees by refusing to pay them and using BTC and waiting until transactions do eventually confirm. 
In the end, they cannot eternally reject a transaction as long as you provide some *reasonable fee.* But I've always scaled my fees based on tx value, not size...mostly because I don't like losing a chunk of my value because the block reward is too small.

Blockchain, Y U NO come up sooner?
@_date: 2012-05-02 18:28:46
Blockchain is back up now, you should probably hop on there and export your unencrypted keys if you can't figure out the password to your *.aes.json files. (Just be sure to shred/delete the unencrypted file once you've finished with it, or encrypt it in a zip file or something)

I'm in america and I'm still having trouble accessing blockchain.info 
According to [their twitter feed]( they've been going up and down.
Currently they're [UP](

The bitcoins I do have in my wallet retained their monetary value overall as compared to when I first bought them. I actually scraped a few bitcents more off of free bitcoin sites and bought a month of reddit gold with the BTC I had leftover. 79 bitcents bought me a month. I've still got a bitcent left. I could scrape bitcents from various survey taking websites and make another month of gold if I wanted to. BiTCoin is doing well enough there.

What I do is use a TrueCrypt file. This file is an encrypted partition and within it I have my bitcoin client installed. (Meaning one has to know the password to the vault and start up bitcoin properly using the shortcut inside the folder it's housed in. 
I do this by specifying the data directory where it stores the block chains and all.
`&lt;drive letter of encrypted volume&gt;:\Bitcoin\bitcoin-qt.exe -datadir=&lt;drive letter of encrypted volume&gt;:\Bitcoin\data`
The main part you need to run is `bitcoin-qt.exe -datadir=&lt;directory where your wallet.dat file is stored, securely?&gt;`

I have a unique definition of laundering, because I have a unique definition of "Dirty" money. Money that isn't actively going to fund unnecessary wars/violence/violent crimes isn't dirty; and I understand my opinion of what is right and wrong will differ from one person to the next.
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:02:38


I'll agree with this part of your statement, but I do have a unique idea of what laundering is. 
Laundering Money is considered laundering money when you do it for the following reasons: 
To EXCESSIVELY evade duly collectable taxes, to the extent that the amount is a capital gain and reasonably reoccurs in an amount that EXCESSIVELY EXCEEDS (~2+x) the amount needed to subsist on that income solely for a month or so. 
To assist in criminal enterprise where harm is being done to another human. Excludes grey/dark market of pharmaceutical goods/marijuana/harmless illicit substances where seller does not happen to be funding violence against any human or humanity.
To allow the exchange of funds tied up in transactions related/relating to violence against humans. (Includes dangerous weapons, not purchased with pure intent of self-defense to defend ones life/home/family)

Your mistake was using something that can be cataloged into a password dictionary.
