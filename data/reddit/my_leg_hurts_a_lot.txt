Real estate is heavily inflated right now because of low new housing starts, coupled with the stiffer lending requirements enacted after the recession.   
China is barely a blip in the factors pushing up housing prices.  They are high because supply of houses, and access credit to buy those houses, are both extremely low compared to historical norms.  The new "normal" of housing starts is equal to the bottom end of housing starts from basically 1950-2008 recession.  And that's in raw numbers, not even as a % of population.  We are building less houses for a larger population, and making it harder to get a loan for that house.  
China... fucking lol no.

Most places banned murder a long ass time ago but that still happens.  These analogies between what has and hasn't been banned and crypto are empty circle jerking.

Yeah I did engage.  Because you lead with this ridiculous premise and obviously false statement.  A statement that is clearly not made in good faith, but in an attempt to shit on the left, own some libs, whatever the kids are calling it these days.  Take that elsewhere.

Doubtful  


Yes we know you pull things out of your ass and pass it off as a legitimate argument.  I already said you were arguing in ideology not reality, thank you for backing me up.  Despite whatever you think you're saying, your argument comes across as left bad, right good, dems bad, republican good, liberal bad, conservative good, etc.  
PS - soybeans are one of the largest cash crops in the US, we sell more soybeans than any other nation.  Well at least we did until those tariffs came in.  You know... from the red states folks.  Get real man.

Ha, unless I go ask somebody else this argument is void, what a chickenshit way to get out of your own dumb words.  You're here to shit on the left, fuck off with it.

The $20B/year in ag subsidies can be paid using only 4.5% of Cali's federal taxes.  Ag is such a small slice of the federal budget, and is in no way the main reason those tax dollars are moving to red states.  
Nations have been trading for food for thousands of years.  If somehow the US split between red and blue states, like you want, the blue states would not starve.  
Your entire argument is based on ideology and not reality.  Please try again.

I'm a hypocrite for not asking some other random person about what they said?  That's the best you can come up with?   Get bent dumbass.

Yeah let's fuck up the soybean market but make hemp legal but don't give farmers enough time or notice to switch before we fuck up the soybean market, better give em an additional $12B so they can make it through one year.  If it was planned to replace soybeans with hemp the execution failed miserably.  Again, the reality vs ideology issue comes up.  You want to own the libs and will perform whatever mental gymnastics are necessary to be correct.    
Take your political nonsense to an appropriate forum.

Shouldn't you just accept that you did something and not worry about what everybody else did.  Shut the fuck up.

Highly unlikely to fall to zero, but assuming any currency can't go to zero is absurd.  They have all the potential to fall out of use though one method or another.

Dude shut the fuck up already, you argument was stupid, you got called out, now you're grasping at straws to make me a hypocrite so you can still somehow "win".  You belong on Fox News, fuck yourself you god damn moron.
