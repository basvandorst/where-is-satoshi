And much more wallets from 2011 and stuff from people that mined for fun and lost everything. A lot of them mined more than 3BTC per week so...

Is bitcoin really able to be used worldwide for the average-joe and as easy as fiat?
Problems like:
- Fees 
- Wallets
- Private keys
- Scams/ hacks 
- Volatility
In this moment only with some study and basic tech background you truly understand how bitcoin work. 
I can't expect my parents to understand a private key and how they should store them for example.
What kind of solutions are being worked out to fight this technical stuff to make bitcoin the "coin".
Not FUDing and the english isn't the best but I hope you get the point.

Which wallet did you use? I love Litecoin and imo would be better for this but using bitcoin like that is amazing! Great video thanks for sharing

First ask for a donation to buy a lambo, then bitcoin is hacked. Hackerman?

In my country we still don't pay taxes in crypto profit unless you do this professionally (aka trader).
The best way for taxes in this work would be you put 100€ and with all the trades (crypto to crypto) you end up cashing out 1000€. If they tax the 900€ profit that would be so easy to understand, but with crypto to crypto taxable damnnn
