No you wouldn’t. Just about every single person ever likes to think they’re so big and tough, and they would *never* let someone get away with robbing them, but the reality is almost every single person suddenly surprised by a gun in your face is going to do exactly what they want because it’s the natural response of the body to avoid death. And even if you are as tough as you think, you’ll probably just get killed until you’re some Navy SEAL trained in disarming an armed attacker with your bare hands. Is a bit of money really worth losing your life over? Leave your family behind just so you could look tough?What a ridiculous thing to say.

If it wants to be an actual currency with more adoption, that’s what it needs to do.

It means pay your damn taxes and don’t try to hide your wealth from the government.

Because the point for a significant amount of users is the gains. That’s what happens when you grow by 150% over a month.

Just about Every single professor, economist, or economic student you’ll talk to will tell you the exact same thing : it’s a speculative bubble, this rate of growth is not sustainable, and it will crash. It’s just a matter of when and how hard.

Likely a good bit of people who bought in using bank transactions during the rise from 10K to 15K who just got their funds available, and cashing out a bit.

That’s a horribly dangerous idea, don’t do that. Don’t invest on credit you can’t pay back if you something goes wrong.

Greed is always the downfall of people trying to time a market. He had a goal, he hit it, and he should pull out. Sure, it could get more valuable, but it’s far smarter to rest assured that your goal has been met.

It’s kind of hilarious. People really just need to step away from the screens and HODL.

It looks like things should remain fairly steady as they did today, with some slow, but stable growth. Things may get a bit more exciting as CME futures go live next week, but if the trend continues, it may continue to have a positive effect.

90% of the people that have come in on this meteoric rise in the past couple weeks are here for the gains. I have no intention of using it as a currency and I think this pipe dream of it magically replacing existing currency systems is pure fantasy.

I wish I hadn’t been so god damn stubborn about it not being a viable currency. I was so caught up on that thought I didn’t see it’s value as a stock until it was far too late.

You’re thinking of government debt in terms of personal debt. The two aren’t really comparable. [Here’s one read]( ). In bad economics times, the government should take on debt to invest in the economy. In good times, the government should increase taxes, increase revenue to reduce deficits/pay down the overall debt.
In general, the government taking on debt is a good thing, and can spur economic growth. There’s good and bad debt, however. Good debt would be debt resulting from investing in the economy and people, ie infrastructure, healthcare, education, defense, etc etc. in the long run this will result in economic growth and stability, and as well as societal benefits. Bad debt can come from slashing taxes and also cutting back on these sort of government spendings, where the government is essentially just taking on more debt without contributions to economic growth.

The amount of first time investors with absolutely no knowledge of economics here is staggering

Because any dingus with a computer can make a chart that shows some random growth that probably isn’t accurate

Granted the hype of the meme money got a bunch of 18 year olds who haven’t invested in anything before to buy up some Bitcoin with the minimal savings they had, so it makes sense a bunch of people freak out about it.
