Can you ELI5? Say that i send .5 btc to someone and they give me .3 or smaller amounts. Dont i not get anything out of it? How does one determine who to trade with and how much to get
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:14:18
Up to what math?
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:03:40
I am really curious what is the point of trading btc? can you explain what the purpose of it is?
@_date: 2014-04-03 11:54:11
As someone who has 0 experience with programming/crypto currency, except bitcoin, can i benefit from this course?
I feel like the course would be a foreign language to me
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:23:08
yay my 0.20005 is now worth roughly 200$ :')
made a 85$ profit..not bad for a student with no job
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:58:09
fuck now its $340..
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:16:13
Do you have the article? Im on mobile right now
@_date: 2014-10-02 20:45:33
I have this problem as well. Linked Bank account then 2 days later tried to verify my deposits only to have it say they were the incorrect funds.
Waited another day to attempt again, only to have my supposedly linked bank account not even linked to my Circle account..
Contacted support about this and said they would contact me as soon as they find a solution
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:10:28
Whats the story on this? ELI5..
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:02:10
ELI5, why do i need to do a cash deposit to a bank? What roles do banks have in the transactions? 
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:16:04
Wow fantastic..How am i just finding about LibertyX?!
@_date: 2015-01-31 01:21:44


Yes i used a passphrase. I wrote down my passphrase along with my seed exactly how it is.


I did not use more than one account. Also I never made any additional accounts. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:12:05
Even with the price fluctuations and all, i would not be effected?
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:21:02
Thank you much i will do exactly that! Im still in shock...sounds so good to be true o:
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:52:37
Looks like its not supported in the United States yet..would definitely make buying Bitcoin easier with cash..
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:32:58
No but you can purchase multiple pin codes. But there is currently a $1,000 spending limit per 24 hours i believe. So you could get 5 $200 pin codes if you wanted (someone correct me if i am wrong)
@_date: 2015-01-30 14:24:51
So the recent changes doesn't affect the security of Trezor? That was my main concern 
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:11:57
This makes me so sad :(
Does this mean Trezor is vulnerable now that it is not open source?
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:30:20
How do you set up buy bots?
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:18:54
I know this is kind of an old post, but what about using Electrum on TAILS instead of Ubuntu?
@_date: 2015-01-20 13:46:40
You're doing great work!
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:05:35
Can someone ELI5? I ordered mine from Amazon yesterday and it will be at my doorstep tomorrow.
Edit: I think i will be returning my TREZOR once it arrives in the mail tomorrow
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:09:14
Nice. Is it really that easy?
edit: are there any problems using BTC-E on TOR?
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:10:51
Thanks for this write up! Theres a store that accepts near me! I can't wait for this
Edit: so the price goes by Bitstamps rate?
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:12:17
and to think i was going to stash all my Bitcoin in TREZOR...
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:57:56
Nope. The only thing you need to provide is a Name, phone number, and address i believe when signing up on the website.
No form of ID is required when purchasing however
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:32:19
What kinda fees come into play for all the exchanging between BTC and LTC
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:07:31
increments of only 50,100,200, or 300. Also it was cash only
@_date: 2015-01-19 18:38:53
I get a free $5 if i am the first person to pop a store's cherry for using LibertyX pretty much.
And as of now, no fee!
The worker actually tried to say they do a $1 fee of something id but i specifically explained to him there was actually no fee
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:30:16
Is this all done at a bank? I don't understand Liberty X, can you explain the process a bit?
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:08:39
1. Walk in store, tell worker i want to purchase a Qpay Pin code for LibertyX.
2. Give him the amount of money for wanted Pin code either 50,100,200, or 300$
3. Prints receipt with pin code
4. Go home redeem my Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:21:17
Be on the lookout for my first LibertyX experience!
@_date: 2015-04-02 15:46:37
As someone with an iPhone, would it work to get an Android phone and download an app that supports Trezor? Even though i wont have phone service for it, but wifi only
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:07:15
WOW this is a game changer for sure
@_date: 2015-03-05 02:11:39
Where can regular users buy these coin???
@_date: 2015-03-06 06:18:07
Can you explain what Amazon's MTurk is? On mobile rn
@_date: 2015-03-18 01:31:53
Thank you for clearing this up
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:07:20
Am i able to use my Trezor with Electrum on Tails? Anyone successfully done so?
@_date: 2015-03-03 04:43:18
You gonna have more listings in the future? 
@_date: 2015-03-09 06:39:17
What are the benefits of using Dark Wallet? Im on mobile right now, and will look if up when i get a chance to get on a computer, but can someone explain?
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:04:03
Someone please ELI5 D:
@_date: 2015-03-05 03:01:58
I honestly dont even know lol, so how do we buy them, where are they auctioning them off?
@_date: 2015-03-13 13:44:42
Would a MasterCard Debit card work?
@_date: 2015-03-02 18:13:13
@_date: 2015-03-25 04:57:33
@_date: 2015-03-02 23:35:06
What do you mean in your first point that there hasn't been any legal way to avoid being taxed on investments in Bitcoin? 
What if someone were to buy their Bitcoin in cash and overtime keep on accumulating say 20-40 BTC over time all anonymously. 
How would it be traced to you?
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:27:58
Just PM'd!


And wow i did not know this, thank you!
@_date: 2015-03-02 15:26:47
I see. I just don't see the point in trusting a 3rd party with my Bitcoin to do that, when i can just hold the Bitcoin myself and have full ownership of my coin. Am i missing something??
@_date: 2015-02-04 05:43:56
Just finished seeing it. Great documentary!
@_date: 2015-02-11 22:55:25
Has anyone tried this yet? Seems like this could be very convenient 
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:03:52
There is like a $3-$5 markup Bitcoin price sadly, but guess that comes at the premium of the service
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:16:17
So these are ATM deposits made in stores like Walmart simply put? 
edit: also, Woodforest is not available as an option on BitQuick's site
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:27:50
Sidechains?? ELI5?
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:57:47
What does the future have in store for iOS? 
@_date: 2015-02-26 03:37:25

@_date: 2015-02-21 15:38:34
Quick question! When i am about to place an order i have the options of choosing "Any Local Credit Union". How do i know if my Credit Union bank is accepted? (Northwest Federal Credit Union) or for instance Apple Federal Credit Union?
@_date: 2015-02-25 01:28:03
Excellent 
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:59:35
How has been using DarkWallet btw?
@_date: 2015-02-26 03:44:38
Any "average" user would certainly do this if it meant they want to safely hold their funds. At least that was the case for me. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 21:16:14
Im enrolled in this course as well. Where are the textbooks that are required? I didn't see any mention of a textbook
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:05:29
When did they start implementing the 24 hour rule?
My second time using LibertyX, roughly 2 weeks ago, i bought 3 pin codes and redeemed them fine after 3 or 4 days
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:05:20
Would like to know this as well
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:23:03
Im with you on the MasterCard :(
looks like i gotta wait for this damn 4 day transaction
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:01:50
I already made a first purchase. However, when i click Buy Bitcoins on Coinbase, the Buy Confirmation indicator shows up saying $X.XX BTC will arrive to your Coinbase account in 4 business days on Tuesday Dec 24, 2013. 
why does it say that. will i not be able to get them right away?
@_date: 2013-08-23 23:02:11
Where would i even start? From the right programs, to the amount to invest in, the right pool?
@_date: 2013-08-23 21:33:39
What would be the right direction for someone to head to who wants to start looking into bitcoin?
Already read all the FAQ's, but the information is pretty overwhelming. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:30:37
Are there anythings specifically i should do prior to this?
