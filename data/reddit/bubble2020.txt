Yeah and they would be interested for 1 reason only: TAXES

Only ICE is allowed in this market and all banks or institutions must go thru them. Their trades will be backed by physical bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-07 12:27:20
Absolutely ! Manipulation in this market is rampant as it’s unregulated. They r filling their pockets on every wipe out. It’s the only way they can steal ur bitcoin and alt coins.

That paper is just opinion. Numbers pulled out of air based on nothing, zero. Ignore.

Their currency is falling because their heavily indebted government borrowed in dollars. As the dollar rises, their debt explodes, inflation soars and people can’t cope. Ever since the 2008 financial crisis this has been creeping up. And now it’s coming to a head. They will eventually replace the dollar, but with what? SDR? Will we have many currencies that r accepted everywhere? Who knows...

After much mor thought, I do not believe this is an individual. That’s why so much doesn’t make sense. These r Deep State controlled coins getting positioned to (attempt) to stifle the Bitcoin rise into November. Certainly can’t let bitcoin rise too much before the institutions get custody via Bakkt exchange. Their clients would be a bit upset. But make no mistake. They have filled their bags plenty already, especially hedge funds.
The multiple exchanges used addresses major markets 24/ 7. The mixing, to use ur term, is just to fake us out and confuse the issue. The Deep State can move the coins wherever they want, without issue. No KYC needed. 
Pretty clear things r going to hit the fan in October. But if you, Silk, had not brought this to the boards attention, we might not know. So really unclear what your motives are, as everyone has an agenda of some sort. What is ur agenda with this Silk? Why jump into this, as don’t u have other things going on, like a job or family?

Actually if possible, average down. We r still in a bear market, despite rallies. But just look at how these go. Each rally is smaller and smaller as we consolidate and prepare for a new bull. When will that be? Who know what xavtly but time and price are key here. Be grateful for this time to collect your fav projects and watch the ones that r clearly starting to rise to the top.

He must of been asleep in December as just maybe that was a better time to sell....geez.

Really amazing, detailed work. Congrats on this.  Just curious, how did u latch on to tracking this account or maybe u track a lot of them?
My immediate thoughts r why would someone move ALL of their holdings to an exchange ( that’s not decentralized therefore risk)? If u had a few bills to pay, couldn’t u just sell a few? Feels like desperation. Not to mention he/she/they missed out on December.
I also heard that 100 million in tether was moved to Bitfinex in the last day or so. ( Crypto Kirby) What is going on? Maybe a hedge fund? Or even government owned account poised to sell to manipulate the market in Oct ( Red October). There are many reasons I could see BTC taking off soon and this could be a move to prevent that. Very interesting indeed.

The address under update 1 looks like a mining operation.

More derivatives ( and so much more) so they can control and manipulate this asset class, along with all the other banks and institutions. Just like they did for every single other asset class they drove into the ground. Gotta get that extra nickel!!!! 
Seriously it should be illegal for ANY BANK OR INSTITUTION to be involved.

Umm... no. Just stupid.

The world is changing rapidly. They are all unprepared for a world without man in the middle.

Actually your math is incorrect. 2-3 years apart can apply to the stock market cycles ( ex 2000-2003 correction). Bitcoin is young and only in its first wave. The maximum possibly correction in time is early 2019. Shorter periods target July as a turn as well. Watch.
@_date: 2019-02-18 20:47:23
Love it!!
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:09:27
Yes, but will those paying attention now. Only BTC or u own alts too?
@_date: 2019-02-16 12:28:56
JPM coin. Lol. On a private, closed network. Lol. What’s the point. And who cares. They think they r going to usurp XRP, or any other such payment network that will dominant in the future cuz they just want to play in their own sandbox, all alone.
Get real. Many payment platforms r light years ahead of anything u guys could do. Time to realize the bankers r losing control. The greatest day.

Thank you for sharing your story. It seems everyone, including talking head media ( what do they know) wants to shame those who are long term holders. Really? That’s the mantra of Wall Street so there is no shame. You have lost nothing but paper gains. And as blockchain grows systemically, it will be a wonder to see all the positive that comes from this new tech and it’s evolution. 
And now that Wall Street sniffs the profits to be made, they want to join the party. It’s sad really, as they will take over this space and the trading character of the market will change. This is inevitable. But the good news is the validation of the technology will be propelled higher, as it helps to build a new financial system based on trust, verified. It’s what we have always needed and now there is no choice.
I too am long, and look forward to a new rising, in time. I do not see the coming cycle the same as the last. With the good that WS brings, we must take the bad. So sit back, enjoy your life. And know you have invested well for the next 10 years. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 02:37:10
Or not. With Wall Street involved, the character of the market changes. It will likely slow down in a big way.

Fidelity is for institutions only. In fact, Bakkt, Eric X , all of them r for institutional money only. Did u really think they would make it easy for the average retail investor? No. They will get their bags filled FIRST.

Well I’d try contacting google CEO. Seriously. He just admitted before Congress that they track and store every bit of data you produce. I’d even try the NSA. It’s well known all our everything is stored on data farms, so start doing investigating. When u generated a computer generated password, it did not store it so u could access it later? I have a Mac too.
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:09:32
Correct. A matter of time.

Great post. I look back on my parents investments and wonder as well. They had the choice of investing in an eastern ski resort or property on an island off the coast out South Carolina. They chose the ski resort as it was closer to home. 40 years later they sold the resort property basically breaking even, after all the icey east winters and issues with construction. The island choice, where beach front was selling for a song, was Hilton Head Island. This could have been their retirement. But they made the wrong choice, financially. Now we still have our wonderful ski memories, but for them, they lacked the vision of what could have been.
Moral: think carefully about the coins you invest in, and if u believe in this future, hang on. My only word of advice. Due diligence. Your best bet, at this point, is infrastructure plays, as with out the picks and shovels, this entire asset class can not be built. Why do u think WS wants to take over this asset? It’s the first time in multiple decades, arguably since the industrial revolution, that we are being presented with something that can actually change all the bs in the world for the better. Choose wisely, and sell some along the way to recoup your investment. And let the rest ride. Love u Mom and Dad.

Truth be told, this is nothing more than the cycle rearing it’s ugly. People want to blame something daily. Don’t. It’s a waste of time and energy. Just understand we r down till the cycle bottoms. And as with all markets, a basing period ensues. That’s it. So god time to accumulate and stay strong. Support at 2951.
