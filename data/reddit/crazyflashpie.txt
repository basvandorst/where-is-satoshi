You think Monero sounds like weak sauce? What about Whats App? What about Snap Chat? What about Facebook, What about fucking Twitter or Google or Yahoo!? All of those names sounded stupid the first time you heard it - same as Bitcoin. Monero may sound weak to you but the technology is beautifully powerful - this is coming from me, one of the biggest bitcoin hardcore fans in the world - so, get used to the name Monero. Yell it form the rooftops because it's not going anywhere.

This isn't about forcing shit on you. It's about enabling two willing participants to exchange something of value. If someone makes digital art that other people want to pay to collect then great!

$10k is too small a value considering that's three block-reward haltings from now. A X10 increase in price from $1k is just too small a move. It will be another order of magnitude above the prices you listed. Remember that Bitcoin doesn't need 1 trillion dollars to flow into the market for it's market cap to be in the trillions. The price will be a function of remaining supply and demand. Traders follow a herd mentality and once it becomes obvious that Bitcoin is not going anywhere and is poised to be THE protocol for value transfer on the web there will be a huge rush into it. It will be absolutely insane, like the Gold Rush of the 1800's on crack.

My guess is that there will be a bubble that takes Bitcoin close to 1 Million USD sometime before 2025. The price will then have to recover from it, similar to today. My first guess was 300k but 2025 puts us after another block reward halving, so maybe it will be closer to 500-700k.

10 years from now Bitcoin will be common place as a store of value, for retirement accounts, and everyone will have a device that is mining bitcoins. There will be decentralized autonomous corporations running on MaidSAFE that are outcompeting established players, mainly cloud storage and cloud computing services. There will be DAC versions of Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox and Grub Hub. There will be gamification of just about everything thanks to embedded sensors all over the place. Points will be able to be traded, redeemed, gifted, etc. People will enjoy self-driving cars, Virtual Reality music festivals and high-fidelity augmented reality on a daily basis. The human relationship with money will be much different from today. Most people will receive weekly or biweekly pay form their employers as well as extra funds from providing DAC services (renting out hard drive space). in 2025 the purchasing power of 1 Bitcoin will be the equivalent of $700,000 today.

Planetary Resources is a company based in Redmond, Washington that is developing the capabilities to explore and recover resources from asteroids. The company was founded in 2010 by two leaders in commercial and entrepreneurial space, Eric C. Anderson and Peter Diamandis. Our company has staff with world-class engineering, scientific and software knowledge. Several of our engineers are alumni of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and were lead engineers, mission managers, and flight directors for complex and successful Mars missions such as Spirit, Opportunity, Phoenix, and Curiosity. Other staff have been drawn from innovative industry leaders including Intel, Google, and Space X. Planetary Resources is a company that has the technical expertise to achieve its mission of asteroid resource exploration and recovery.
Planetary Resources is privately funded, with investment from noted technology leaders such as Eric Schmidt and Larry Page of Google, H. Ross Perot Jr. of the Hillwood Group, Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin Group, and Charles Simonyi, formerly Chief Architect at Microsoft. This support has given the company the financial means to accomplish its goals.
Asteroid resource exploration and recovery may seem like a distant vision, but Planetary Resources has already completed construction of its first spacecraft and is awaiting launch. Once deployed, this satellite will demonstrate core technologies for Planetary Resources future missions. It will also be symbolically significant, because it will mark the beginning of private asteroid resource exploration and recovery. Planetary Resources will be launching a new spacecraft approximately every few months to discover and explore asteroids and ultimately to recover the valuable resources on those asteroids.
STRATEGIC AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY
Asteroids are abundant in three classes of resources: volatiles and water (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen); platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum); and structural metals (iron, cobalt, and nickel).
Water has a number of high value uses in space, but it currently costs in excess of $23,000 per pound to transport from Earth. Water will be useful for human exploration, as it provides hydration and radiation shielding. Water can also be changed into fuel, through electrolysis, thereby turning the water into its elemental components of oxygen and hydrogen. One 75-meter water-bearing asteroid has enough hydrogen and oxygen to have launched all 135 Space Shuttle missions. Spacecraft are launched with all the fuel they will ever have and therefore their lifetime is limited by fuel – the equivalent of throwing away a car when the tank is empty. Being able to store water and fuel in space fundamentally changes the ways we can explore space and conduct national and commercial operations in space.
PLATINUM GROUP METALS
Platinum group metals are extremely rare resources – even rarer than rare-Earth elements – and are necessary for the construction of catalytic convertors, electronics, medical devices, glass, turbine blades, and jewelry. Today, the major sources of platinum group metals are South Africa and Russia. A single 500-meter platinum-rich asteroid contains more platinum than has been mined in the history of humanity.
STRUCTURAL METALS
It is extraordinarily expensive to launch heavy structures into space, and in most cases, the engineering design is optimized for the 9-minute journey to space, not for its use in space. Planetary Resources is developing the long-term capability to recover metals from asteroids and build specialized structures in space utilizing emerging technologies such as 3D printing. The capacity to build structures in space will fundamentally change commercial, civil, and scientific space activities.
Planetary Resources is not alone in this industry. There are other competitors here in the U.S. There is also strong competition coming from China and Russia. Both nations have stated their intent to begin developing the technologies to recover resources from outer space.
ASSURING U.S. LEADERSHIP
Planetary Resources believes the ASTEROIDS Act does three things critical to developing U.S. private asteroid resource exploration and recovery: 1.	Provides a clear statement of resource ownership in full compliance with international obligations 2.	Begins the discussion on oversight and regulation 3.	Establishes U.S. leadership in policy and a new market
RESOURCE OWNERSHIP
The ASTEROIDS Act provides necessary clarity about who owns resources recovered in space by creating straightforward rules for U.S. courts to follow in adjudicating any future disputes between entities subject to U.S. jurisdiction. This clarity permits and promotes increased investment throughout the private sector.
The existing UN Treaties recognize, encourage, and allow the use of space by nations, and by non-government entities. The recovery and ownership of resources in space has been recognized for several decades. Specifically, it has been over 40 years since the United States and the U.S.S.R. each returned samples from the Moon, and more recently Japan did the same from an asteroid, and no nation or entity has raised serious objections to those nations’ right to use and control the property they have returned from space.
It was the intent of the nations negotiating the relevant treaties that space resource exploration and recovery should not be prevented by the treaties. In 1980, the then Legal Adviser to the Department of State, Robert Owen, provided testimony to Senate’s Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space. Mr. Owen noted that these treaties were negotiated with the understanding that it does not prevent the extraction of natural resources.
Planetary Resources believes that the ASTEROIDS Act was carefully written to be in full compliance with all international obligations. The negotiating history of those obligations makes it very clear that commercial resource recovery in space and ownership of those resources is allowed and protected.
OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION
According to the UN Liability Convention, ratified by the United States in 1972, states are required to authorize and supervise the space-based activities of private entities to ensure they are complying with international obligations.
There are currently no U.S. oversight and regulation mechanisms that govern asteroid resource exploration and recovery. Planetary Resources believes the ASTEROIDS Act does an excellent job framing the potential development of these oversight mechanisms without being prescriptive – and without prematurely creating a new regulatory entity or spending new money. Writing legislation now that attempts to prescribe every operational scenario and technology that needs to be regulated would be impossible because many of this market’s technologies and operations are new and still under development. The ASTEROIDS Act creates the framework for a productive exchange of ideas between Congress, the Executive Branch, and industry that can eventually lead to an informed, responsive, and productive regulatory regime.
LEADING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
The ASTEROIDS Act is a domestic law and has no impact on non-U.S. concerns that may conduct asteroid resource exploration and recovery activities. However, Planetary Resources believes that the ASTEROIDS Act creates a foundation, in full compliance with existing international obligations, which could be easily adopted by other nations. The concepts of property rights, freedom from harmful interference, and safety of operations form the core components necessary for asteroid resource exploration and recovery companies from all nations to operate safely, predictably, and cooperatively in space. Planetary Resources firmly believes that the U.S. Government can use the ASTEROIDS Act to promote these core concepts in the UN and other international forums for international recognition and adoption.
Private asteroid resource exploration and recovery activities are currently underway. Planetary Resources applauds the actions of Congress on this important and timely matter. With the ASTEROIDS Act, Congress has made clear that it is the intention of the United States to lead in this critical market.
The ASTEROIDS Act complies with all treaties, agreements and conventions to which the United States is a party; recognizes the need to develop applicable regulations at the appropriate time; and clarifies the right of U.S. entities to mine resources from asteroids. The ASTEROIDS Act provides a strong foundation for asteroid mining companies like Planetary Resources to begin commercial asteroid resource exploration and utilization in space, provides confidence to investors, stability to the industry, and builds upon a foundation of domestic and international law.

It's brilliantly designed Money. The characteristics that makes "stuff" become "Money" in human cultures are:
(1) It must be durable, which is why we don’t use wheat or corn or rice.
(2) It must be divisible, which is why we don’t use art work.
(3) It must be convenient, which is why we don’t use lead or copper.
(4) It must be consistent, which is why we don’t use real estate.
(5) It must possess value in itself, which is why we don’t use paper.
(6) It must be limited in the quantity that is available, which is why we don’t use aluminum or iron.
(7) It should have a long history of acceptance, which is why we don’t use molybdenum or rhodium.
Only GOLD and SILVER fit all seven characteristics. Bitcoin is designed to excell in all 7. The amazing thing is that Bitcoin has the scarcity of gold but without physical MASS, so we can transfer ownership of bitcoins via the internet across fiber optic cables, wifi, radio, etc. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 20:24:56

What you don't hear from tech folks is that investors with deep pockets already think bitcoin is good enough. Why? Because it has the biggest market cap and that's important when you start talking about transmitting hundreds of millions of dollars through the network. 5 years lead time is a lifetime and no other crypto has any hope of catching up to Bitcoin at this point. Do you think the guys are Fortress Investments would dump 150 million into Bitcoin only to watch their investment float away? You underestimate the players involved now...and the friends they are bringing with them. Sure, the Bitcoin community is small but the sort of money and power that is quietly amassing behind this protocol is no joke and they are in it for the long haul - any new crypto competing directly with Bitcoin is DOA.

Because no one is pushing Bitcoin down anyone's throats. The userbase has grown organically and democratically. Bitcoin won't go to zero because it's already been at zero - for almost a year when the network first began. And from my own personal experience I have friends who work for one of the largest private banks in the united states (one of the top 2) and they've gone from being total skeptics to having Bitcoin be part of their training and job as private wealth managers. They have been trained to expect prices of $10,000 per BTC and beyond in the next 12-24 months. Needless to say they are now accumulating Bitcoins every month without fail.

"Money flows like a pyramid in our current system, and society reflects that form, specifically our fiat currency system uses a fixed supply of gold as “power money” on which many multiples of fiat credit are used in a flexible supply to allow us to trade and buy groceries with credit cards. 
That system begins with gold buried in the vaults of central banks, who then swap freshly created fiat currency for government debt, it goes out to the banking system creating loans and thus fresh bank deposits for more loans, and after a decent amount of businesses make some profits to pay those loans and their employees, those employees try investing in stocks and bonds, until finally you get to the interest rate derivatives and all that. There are a few trillion bucks worth of gold, base USD cash supply is 1.something trillion, all the base supply of major fiat currencies are in the ballpark of the value of the gold. This chart shows base money, which includes all those T-bonds that the Fed has been buying, might raise an eyebrow or two. Bank credit (those dollars your bank statement says you have but are not in your hand) is over 10T. All those stocks and bonds and mortgage securities are in the tens of trillions, and the notional value of derivatives have exceeded and are now pushing 1 Quadrillion dollars, that’s uh, quadrillion with a capital “Q” for you right there.

The incumbent systems are inefficient, more expensive and they prevent Billions of people from the benefits of banking services. The current systems are also corrupt which leads to currency devaluation as we have seen in Argentina and other parts of the world. Mass adoption of crypto currencies is inevitable as there is no other open, secure, fast, and trust-less system. The competitive advantages presented by Bitcoin and the infrastructure that is building around it is undeniable. It is an economic slippery slope as more companies use Bitcoin to provide cheaper financial services to a broader market than traditional fiat services. Netflix killed Blockbuster and other video rental chains by disintermediating the incumbents, affordable prices and ease-of-use. All of this shit has happened before and it will happen again with Bitcoin.

A) Yes, they went below market and lost. We also know other players claimed they bid at market price and they also lost. 
B) The proof is that he won all of the coins. Given that others bid at or below market, then, draper could only have won the coins if and only if he bid above at or above market. 
C) The strategy is to acquire Bitcoins at a "good" price. If you expect the price to return to $1000 in the next year then paying above the market price of $370 is a good strategy if the alternative is losing to tim Draper again.

It's obvious. Btc has biggest headlines, biggest network, biggest VC funding, largest coding team, longest history, and invented by Satoshi. Thus BTC will attract top talent, grow infrastructure, and displace any competitor. Your avg joe may not give a fuck but money talk, and it's screaming bitcoin.

The point is that having good marketing is a good idea. If you disagree then you will have to wait longer and work harder to make this revolution a success. 
We know that governments and banks are teaming with corruption. In some cases, these institutions are severely oppressive. It's a moral imperative that we make choices (yes, even naming choices) that will help accelerate, as fast as possible, the decentralized revolution that's emerging.

@_date: 2014-01-17 19:26:09
bitcoins are totally worthless....However, the only thing The Bitcoin Network can move around is bitcoins. You've agreed that the dollar has "value" because you have to use it to pay taxes...to enjoy the benefits of not going to jail etc. Likewise, If you want to reap the benefit of paying zero fees on transfering 100 million dollars you need to get bitcoins in order to reap said benefit. Bitcoin, the network, by virtue of only transporting bitcoins creates the same kind of value you assign to the dollar. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 18:45:37

@_date: 2014-06-17 19:56:14
Wrong. Bitcoin is VHS. The alts are trying to be "safer" "more anonymous" "faster confirmation times" etc. They will fail because Bitcoin is good enough and has the greatest network effect (5 years worth) (in OPs video it's where VHS gets into video rental stores). Bitcoin is good enough, and has enough network effects (miners, developers, media attention, investments, community,etc) to be the dominant player. No other alt will succeed in supplanting Bitcoin.

One of the thing that strikes me is that if 1 Bitcoin reaches 1 Million USD, then the exchange rate equates to 1.00 bit = 1.00 usd. And a satoshi = 1 penny. At this value, prices of goods and services would be be similar to the way we normally see prices listed. A $5.99 burger would be 5 bit and 99 sats or 5.99 bit. I believe satoshi's terminal value for Bitcoin is around 1 million usd for this reason.

All around the world all fiat currencies lose between 2 and 50% of their value and stocks can be even more volatile. Bitcoin isn't like a Google share - can you send me a changetip for $1 worth of google stock?  Bitcoin is an experiment and will stablise in time. The larger the user base the more price fluctuations get "averaged out" to the point they are fractions of a percent. Also, Bitcoin volatility is currently one of it's biggest draws - if you had $100 worth of Bitcoin in 2011 you are stoked about it's volatility. Less so if you bought $100 worth in Dec 2013 and that's part of the experiment we are watching unfold.

The "technology behind bitcoin" and "bitcoin" are one and the same. If the "technology behind bitcoin" is to be useful then it should be global, decentralized, secure, and easy to use. No other Bitcoin wannabe has the market depth or the amount of computing power behind it securing the network. This makes Bitcoin the obvious winner here with no formidable competition, specially if you consider the heavyweights coming into the picture with millions of VC funding and in some cases deep political connections. The Network effect is strong with Bitcoin and growing stronger everyday. It seems to me no other wanna be technology has a chance now.

I've debated your idiotic arguments many times already. I know the so-called "smart money" investors, and let me tell you (not that I expect you to believe me) that the "smart money" is betting Big on Bitcoin. No other altcoin has any hope of replacing Bitcoin as a payment network/currency/storeofvalue at this point in the game (i'm guessing you're new around here). The Smart Money folks understand that Bitcoin cannot fail...if it does it will taint any other crypto currency initiative for years. To be clear, this is not my guess or opinion - It is straight from the mouth of the so-called "smart money".

The dollars in your bank account are being devalued daily in the form of inflation. Why? Because in the current system money is Debt. 
Your Bitcoins are equity based. There are only a limited number of coins and their value will continue to increase over time. Since you are lucky enough to live in a first world country, are smart enough to read these words, and have access to a Pay Check, then you are in the perfect position to acquire and see your Bitcoins make exponential gains as adoption increases. Translation: You will probably make more gains holding Bitcoin for a few years than probably any other asset you can think of. 
If you don't care about the intricacies of money. If you don't care that your dollars are used to fund war. If you don't care about technological breakthroughs or about making potentially huge returns on your Bitcoins, then Bitcoin isn't for you and you shouldn't care. 
Be warned: Sooner or later you will have to care if Bitcoin continues to expand its user base.

Do you absolutely need 58 million USD right NOW? The best course of action is to back up your coins. Then take 2-3 thousand of them and liquidate them. 3200 BTC at a price of $420 would net you 1.34 million USD. That's enough to live on for a few years while the Bitcoin ecosystem continues to grow. Eventually you wont need to exchange any of your BTC to USD and can just spend the BTC directly. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 21:46:28
" I  said bitcoin is now no good for everyday use by most of the population" - That's fine. It takes time to build easy products for the avg consumer. 
"It is not even "good enough" for knowledgeable computer geeks who keep complaining on here that they have mysteriously had their BTC stolen (again"
If you don't know how to properly handle your BTC then it's your fault. BTC makes no promises about keeping your hot wallet safe from hackers. That's up to you! 
"History certainly does not show (in general)that being first guarantees future success, there are many examples contrary as well as for that argument so you are just guessing when you say that."
For protocols, it does. Read up! 
"VC money is now being invested in the wider crypto-currecy area, not just bitcoin specific. Ask yourself why."
Show me the money! 
"Hash rate is irrelevant - just a geeky number."
It's a useful measure of how much computing power is securing the network. Why bring up 51% attacks in your earlier comment if you think hashing power is a meaningless number?

In our hypothetical scenario, Mainstream means that there are more places that take BTC than not. If you control your private keys then you can spend your Bitcoins wherever you want despite your bank account being closed and despite what money you may owe to the government. They simply cannot stop you from spending Bitcoin nor can they "freeze" your Bitcoin. Best they can do is arrest you for not paying your taxes.

"AmazonCoin or MasterCardCoin assuming they ever existed would instantly be more popular and used than Bitcoin."
Right. Because that worked out so well for Facebook Credits. 
The reason hundreds of millions of VC dollars are entering Bitcoin is because an AmazonCoin or MasterCardCoin has no hope of being a global currency. It's easier to integrate Bitcoin that it is to spend the hundreds of millions of dollars on equipment and infrastructure for a centralized coin.

1No it wasn't. If you look at 2011 and compare it to 2014 we would need to drop $70 and my statement above would still be valid. In any case, you are free to do as you please. Not to mention the $2 bottom in 2011 was when there was hardly any VC funding or infrastructure built out and the price rebounded 500 fold to $1200.

Your argument boils down to: Bitcoin isn't perfect therefore something else could replace it.
History has shown that it isn't about having a perfect product. It's about being good enough, and being first. Call me up when another crypto has an estimated 30k developers building for it, Hundreds of millions of VC dollars building its infrastructure, and hash rates in the double-digit PHs.

Is it irresponsible? If you are single and make $75k/year, taking a 10k loan is reasonable. No less reasonable than taking a 6 figure loan to buy a property somewhere and hope the price goes up. However, taking out a 50k loan on a 75k salary would be unreasonable.

You bring up a good point. However, you many not know that it's possible to identify individuals who may be anonymous based on the data that can be extracted form the blockchain due to the way networks form. For example, on Twitter, you can be geo-located to within a few kilometers based on your social graph even if your geo-tagging is turned off. It only takes about 2-4% of users having their geo-tags turned on to geo-locate 90% of twitter users. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:55:33
A Monero sidechain wouldn't have the same financial incentive as an independent blockchain/coin. You'd also be seen sending to this sidechain and could be flagged as suspicious.

I don't think you realize that Satoshi knew Monero was possible to make. He (wisely) chose to unleash Bitcoin as a trojan horse for Monero. 
Bitcoin's traceability lured Gov't into allowing easy fiat-&gt;btc on-ramps. They are happy to let you turn your dollars into bitcoin that they can track (the onramps like coinbase have to comply with aml/kyc regulation). What they miss is that once in BTC no one can prevent you from transacting to Monero and becoming anonymous. 
Fiat -&gt; BTC -&gt; Monero is the path to freedom. BTC will be the foundation of the new universe of Finance and Monero will become the storage of private wealth.

The money would come from two sources. The first source would probably come from a governmental agency or a corporate sponsor. However, there could be a separate wallet that is open to the public for donations. These donations could be received in person or through the internet using bitcoin.

Bitcoin was not designed to be fungible. Now that most fiat -&gt; Btc onramps require an identity (coinbase, circle, etc) millions of wallets have an identity attached to them. Bitcoin is meant to be the world wide public ledger so this is to be expected. A true fungible currency like Monero has a lot of benefits but could never replace the value of a public ledger. Thus, the world needs both Bitcoin and Monero. (if it's not Monero it will be something similar)

The Chief Economist from the Bank of England admitted as much. He said they were looking into the possibility of:
1. Imposing Negative Interest Rates
2. Banning Cash
3. Wanting to Bitcoin/Blockchain as a replacement and a tool do enforce the above.
The side effect would be that the banks could trace every penny of the economy.
This is why Bitcoin will most likely succeed in the long run - because it is very sexy to government. What they wont like is Monero - based on stealth addresses and ring signatures.

My point is 99% will miss out on owning a significant percentage share of the ledger. Many who were bitcoin holders will or have been shaken out of the market by this seemingly never ending bear market.  Once this thing takes off the typical players will own a large percentage stake of the ledger because they can afford it.

I see it as the early BTC guys (that want to engage in illicit activity, or are very private) leaving for Monero. A decentralized private ledger based on POW is important and Monero fills that need.
Bitcoin will continue to grow in the financial services, crowdfunding, etc industries, and other uses that do not yet exist. A decentralized public ledger is important too!

As far as Monero being a shitty name. Monero is a word that carries the meaning of money or coin in dozens of languages and as a marketing professional i can tell you that beside Bitcoin, Monero is the next greatest name you could hope to have for a cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 18:35:25
Yes lets pump a coin whose emission is so high you are almost guaranteed to lose money in the short term./s 
Maybe you should consider there is a market for a truly anonymous currency. Bitcoin's success longterm is guaranteed and there is hardly a threat from these anonymous currencies. They will mostly be used by those who care about privacy. An unbiased analysis of the current bunch of anonymous crypto will yield my conclusion: Monero is the one to watch out for.

It's privacy tech, community and liquidity are all very strong for Monero. The free-market will ultimately decide it's fate and it will either be out-competed by another anonymous coin (or a anonymous side chain) or it won't be. Having been following Bitcoin since 2011 i've developed a 6th sense about some of these projects and Monero has pushed all the right buttons for me. It's too early to dismiss Monero in 2015 the same way it was too early to dismiss Bitcoin in 2010. You are more than welcome over at if you have any specific technical questions. I don't think im qualified to answer all of them.

It's a tough problem. I think in technology there is always a divergence and proliferation of solutions. I wouldn't be surprised to see both Monero and Bitcoin thrive and cater to different crowds. There is plenty of wealth to go around. In any case with Monero being so cheap at .0013 btc it seems like no-brainer hedge.

20 years out the dominant crypto will be Bitcoin - used mainly by autonomous companies, businesses, and  governments.

Monero will be the dominant crypto for human to human transactions, dark markets, dark DAC's and a large segment of the virtual reality, hybrid reality economies. 
1 XMR in today's dollars: $80 Thousand USD

And what are the odds any of these efforts are implemented? What about the inherent weaknesses in all of the various attempts you described? Are you even aware of them? Do you have any clue? No, you don't. You lash out thinking that you know everything, including my own understanding of the technologies in question. Fungibility requires much more than what any of the solutions you listed provide. They simply fall short! Even Monero, in it's current state is imperfect - are you even aware of the CCT papers being discussed? No, you are not.

Agreed that it's a big problem. However, given how the blocksize debate has unfolded, is a solution to Bitcoin's fungibilty (even if it was found) likely to be implemented? The only people I see concerned about fungibility are those of a libertarian leaning (they value privacy) and those who want to make illicit purchases.

I simply disagree with you that these future projects will draw 100% of money interested privacy. Don't get me wrong, I fully expect Bitcoin to succeed and draw large amounts of value into it's blockchain. I just think it's naive to think that all money interested in privacy will flow to these yet-to-be-implemented solutions, and that these technologies will be well received by governments and banks. We're already seeing blacklisting of bitcoins happening:  I wouldn't underestimate government's ability to force major exchanges, wallets and other companies to enforce blacklist coins in the future. I think having a public and private blockchains remain separate makes sense in the grand scheme of things.

If only there was a totally secure and untraceable cryptocurrency with the strongest anonymity baked right into the protocol and a fair distribution (no premine). Even better if the core concept was thought up by Satoshi himself during a conversation about how to improve Bitcoin's anonymity. Oh wait, It already happened and it's called Monero:
If Satoshi had released Monero governments all over would have moved to ban exchanges right away. He instead created Bitcoin which can be tracked (like you described). This made governments think that it would be a good idea to let Bitcoin play out because it meant they could potentially track everything! Hahahaha. Too bad for them Bitcoin is a trojan horse with Monero inside waiting to pounce.

Your analogy isn't totally awesome. How do you get your internet? Is it handed to you for free or do you pay a monthly fee for your phone's data plan and a cable provider as well? If you pirate movies at home without a VPN what will happen? Sure, they can't stop you from watching child porn, buying drugs, or pirating movies. You can choose to do that if you want, but you will be tracked and your service providers will hand over your idenity to the authorities. That's how it works right? This is how Bitcoin will work too. Why do you think the banks have been embracing Bitcoin so hard? Because being able to trace money is awesome and the blockchain is amazing at that. I suspect Satoshi chose not to bake true anonymity into Bitcoin because doing so would have for sure killed Bitcoin long before it had a chance to grow beyond the nerd crowd.

The idiots downvoting me think that i'm trying to bash Bitcoin and promote Monero. This is not the case. I stand by Bitcoin 100% - However, it's worth paying attention to the technology behind Monero because privacy and anonymity are extremely important! Not to mention that core the concept behind Monero was first discussed and expanded upon by Satoshi Nakamoto himself (post Bitcoin) on the BTCTalk forums. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 00:25:44

This is exactly what I was saying. The masses will have no clue. One thing to consider is that using various data mining tool you can infer the identity of a large portion of users based on a smaller set of known persons. Even those attempting to hide might have their identities compromised by the mainstream using circle/coinbase etc. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 07:46:11

 Bitcoin? You mean Monero
@_date: 2015-10-24 16:40:18
The reason Monero holds promise as an independent crypto is IMO due to it's non-currency uses. I suppose a Monero sidechain would be OK if you are only thinking about it from the POV of currency.

@_date: 2015-10-22 20:16:33
Savior of what? I already wrote that I expect Bitcoin to succeed and go to trillion dollar market caps. I hope you're right that fungibility is implemented but i'm a realist and based on the blocksize debate, I consider the odds of Bitcoin getting fungibility anytime soon to be slim. Monero will offer true fungibility baked right into the protocol before Bitcoin is able to do it. This is a good thing as it will create pressure on Bitcoin to push ahead. You seem to think that only Bitcoin will survive long term and no other crypto has a shot of being a serious player, this is an incorrect assumption IMO.

BITCOIN started out at ZERO. Today it's worth $245. It's creator and core developers are geniuses in their fields and everyday thousands of new and brilliant minds discover the potential of what a Bitcoin-enabled future looks like. Already, hundreds of millions of dollars in VC funding and Billions of dollars worth of hardware and manhours have been poured into this incentivized network. This is that start of a new area of immutable history. The Blockchain Era. If you believe this to be a technological trend that society will adopt future then by all means continue to buy the dip.

Bitcoin has had ENORMOUS success considering it's only been around for several years and started out being worth $0. It has no marketing, sales departments and exists solely as a decentralized autonomous corporation. And yet despite this, it has created a new industry that has raised nearly 1 Billion usd in VC money, has the attention of every bank on the planet, and has even brought out doubters like you to come to this sub reddit and comment on it. BLocksize issue is small fry in the grand scheme of things and will be resolved. The pre-Wright Brothers equivalent of Bitcoin all failed, Bitcoin survives and carries on because it is the real deal. (I should add that Monero is also the real deal of private chains and the implementation of CCT into it renders zerocash pointless)

Sounds like they are still ignorant about how bitcoin works under the hood.

Bitcoin is more than a currency. Smart contracts, escrow, decentralized, etc,

Thanks for the pedantic reply :P

It's going up because it's following the standard S-curve of technological adoption. There is only a small opportunity of time to buy in before the vertical part of the exponential and that time is now. Consider yourself lucky to be part of the Gold 2.0 Rush and enjoy the ride to Jupiter.

Everyone knows it can be manipulated and will be manipulated. However,  its getting very expensive to manipulate and once it's out of the exponential growth phase you'll need an enormous amount of money to mess with it. You don't seem to grasp that the rules of the game change over time.

It's a trip to see Joe defending Bitcoin. This is a good sign!

Eh the odds are that if bitcoin was going to fail it would have happened by now. The volatility doesn't scare me and if it crashed to a $1 tomorrow many of us would just buy the coins up. IMO bitcoin is here to stay and will change the online and offline worlds forever.

Ah, I should clarify that it's not about getting anyone to switch over right away only to spread awareness that people are starting to use something called BitCoin and it can be exchanged for goods.

The odds of seeing $400/btc is very low at this point. Best odds is to buy $7k worth now and sell a bit to even out on the next bubble.

This right here is why there will be an attack on altcoins. This is a winner takes all game and the winner will be bitcoin. The altcoins are fucked - litecoin will die last but it too is doomed. Bitcoin is the USB of 2010's
