There should be no problem in running several LN nodes on top of one BTC node - if it can handle the load of RPC requests it should be fine.

If you think you have what it takes, there is some Bitcoin up for grabs! Brief contest description here:

Definitely legit :) give us some time to validate the solutions - expect an email from us soon.

Thanks, much appreciated. And have fun with the game!

Nope. The game also shows the current best players progress (updates once in a few hours) so you can check that ;)

Glad you liked it!
All in all about 70 people participated. There were 3 other people who got very close to the winner and finished a few hours after he got all the solutions. Many more completed a large portion of the game but also there were several who gave up (or got bored) pretty quickly.
We hoped for a lot more exposure which unfortunately did not happen. It is very likely we will do more stuff like this with better rules so more people can participate and have a chance to win even if they don't learn about the contest right when it starts.

Sadly, no. Only Android :(

Sadly not all devices are compatible, some old ones or atypical ones will not work.

Looks like there is one payment, though not of the correct amount:
