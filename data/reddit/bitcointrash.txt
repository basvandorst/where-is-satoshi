Your post goes from 
“hi I know nothing about bitcoin is x true” 
“does the native getnewaddress RPC call produce a segwit address on 0.15.1”
This thread is just wasted space and similar stuff gets posted every day. Search something. Google it. 
If you want GUI support go build it. It’s like people don’t know what open-source is.

It’s bitcoin trash.

Green dildo’s on YouPorn being the cause of Bitcoin bull market? I don’t see any FUD here.

This is the type of content I need in my life. Funny how aligned we are serious discussion. There is no arguing any of this, to my knowledge, though I hope to see if some of this information is proved wrong. There will be a moment, when Lightning is tried and true and companies are actively implementing it, when the tide changes and money comes back to BTC.

I can't argue with wanting both, though I do think using typical satoshi/byte standards that the rest of the community relies on (which Ledger does now) is more applicable.

DONT CALL IT FUCKING NICKNAMES. BITCOIN TRASH.

Heh, welcome to Bitcoin brochacho.

This is like saying Tor is centralized because you use their client.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:11:35
Probably because you’re a douche. Is it that shocking? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:09:10
I love people like you
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:12:45
It’s like you never even looked at how it works.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:15:43
Which is why we are refusing to let this happen on Bitcoin.

This is fucking awesome
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:21:05
You don’t know.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:45:07
This is exactly how it works...
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:41:26
What? Fuck you dude I completely agree with him.

Block propagation. Becomes difficult to sync x nodes to verify transactions when you have to download, read, write, verify 10GB blocks in 10 minutes.

Sorry man but this is why you let the engineers make decisions on these topics. Nothing against you, you just must not have done much CS or even math in college. Look up exponential growth.
“Bitcoin took from 2009 to 2017 to get to $5,000, it won’t double in a week.”
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:10:24
This is the type of shit I want to see.

Lol. I love when non-CS people have opinions on shit they know nothing about. Sure, people shouldn’t need to be tech savvy to use bitcoin. There’s plenty of options for stupid people already, unfortunately right not that includes a $10 fee (not $30 unless you really have no idea what you’re doing). If you haven’t done enough research to figure out custom fees, you aren’t going to succeed in Bitcoin at this point in time. If you’re so upset about it, why not make the next big Bitcoin Wallet that has the smartest fee allocation of all of them. Realistically it’s on developers and big business right now to make compatible wallets and update to the most current options within the protocol. 
The fees are high, they are growing pains, linear scaling is not the best answer (right now). Use a segwit wallet, go help the devs work on LN, Atomic Swaps, Schnorr sigs, bulletproofs. If you’re not helping with the project, you’re free to make your own and run it into the ground just like Roger is. Big money is in Bitcoin because we are putting the safety of the chain before the conveniences of the masses. 
Satoshi’s true vision didn’t include that garbage EDA either, no ones perfect.

And the “fix” was to sync the chain by patching together three different versions ����
@_date: 2018-05-13 04:11:24
It’s really not that complicated. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:28:08
Remember when S2X failed to find the first block because of the ass quality copy pasting? ABC has Deadalnix, and I’ve yet to see any other devs working on cash. From a programmer standpoint, it’s shameful how people shrug off the work that Core is doing. If there was another implementation for BTC that had programmers who knew and gave a shit about the coin, I think it would be accepted. Problem is we have hard forks proposed by people who don’t know what they’re doing, and citizens trying to run a nuclear reactor. Only so much you can speak to.

I also identify as a 15 year old girl just learning to code. What was this written in?
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:47:38
Idk how old you guys are but most of the younger crowd seem to pick up on Bitcoin pretty quick. I’m a CS major but all that really did for me was help with hashing...
