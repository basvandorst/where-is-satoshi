If you keep an eye on the reddit page you can keep up to date with announcements.

If the network splits into two chains and then generally speaking you hold coins on both chains.
Regarding market value, that has to be decided between chains through a process of price discovery.
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:22:52
You can't choose which chain they are on - you have coins on both chains. 
I say "generally-speaking" because it is a bit more complicated than that. If you are in possession of your private keys you have both sets of coins, but if your coins are on an exchange at the time of the split, it is really up to the exchange what to do (even though they will have both coins they may not accept to run a market for both chains ... they may even not accept to give you the coins on the chain they consider to be the losing chain).
Things are also complicated by certain situations that can arise in this scenario, known as replay attacks. Read an explanation from the Ethereum subreddit here

Article resuming some of the chat on the Bitcoin dev mailing list, actually.
@_date: 2016-11-03 20:06:55
To be honest this was on the cards for all to see. They did it before; they'll do it again. Especially considering the capital outflow everyone is so happy about all over the interwebs.
I wonder about those huge mining farms. What's the score for them?
@_date: 2016-11-08 09:26:10
Unprecedented stuff.

Next article in the pipeline - Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-11-08 09:28:40
Bitcoin's always going to be at the heart of it all.

Nothing - this site is done for the love of it.
As the site grows more micropayment channels will be integrated as a priority. 100% of article tips go to the authors.
With the advent of Bitcoin one of the many areas touted as ripe for disruption is the business of online publishing. The idea is that micropayments will be able to provide revenue for publishers and content creators, in the place of intrusive advertising. 
This is what we want to do.

Having a look - thanks!

Bitcoin is the new printing press.

It's going to take a bit of time, I would expect.

With all the lead up rumours for weeks, it'll be interesting to see if "buy the rumour - sell the news" works in reverse...

Buying Bitcoin is going to become a lot more expensive in China.
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:40:45
Looks like they are actually doing or going to do just that.
There's too much circumstantial evidence and too many claims by diverse people.
It's been getting priced in though as I think more people actually believe this now than not.
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:22:26
It's this refusal to accept reality that keeps the market crashing.

Better still, flip to the 90 day chart

Well, there is a tweet today from a financial reporter in China :
I guess that would mean that Huobi has been verbally notified at least. It would be a good idea to watch them for an annoucement.

It's not so easy for the average Joe in China to do that I guess, what with capital outflow restrictions etc.
Given what is happening I expect that until they close the Chinese exchanges will go on a separate period of price discovery for BTC, to reflect the new reality they are entering.
Bitcoin as a payment network, store of value, and all its other possible facets is going to have a different value proposition there, based on the different socio-economics and incoming regulations. 
That's one of the amazing things about Bitcoin - I think that it is very reasonable to think that the value of a Bitcoin can vary from territory to territory, based on the limits / freedoms that the network enjoys. Its not like gold in that way.
A small-scale example of this phenomenon could be seen when Mt Gox imploded. The value of Bitcoins progressively decoupled from the rest of the market based on the growing risks, until the price was out by 50% or more. I can remember when a decisive moment when the other exchanges just stopped following the Gox death spiral and soared away.

Wake up would you. 
It's not the end of the world. If you'd been around long enough you would have got used to this China stuff. Their exchanges were locked down for months in 2016. The regulators have been breathing down their necks for ages. 
Get used to it.

Wow, interesting to get a troll comment like that for my post.

Yep, true, that's the hint at the start and at the end of the article.

Perhaps it's more complicated than most people on here believe.

@_date: 2016-05-05 22:34:28
This is not a matter of minutes - it's a matter of months... so far.
A PSYOP team couldn't possibly dream up something better than this if they tried. Which is perhaps telling in itself...
@_date: 2016-05-05 22:56:37
Fair enough, and I appreciate what you are saying about the spirit of bitcoin.
Actually, for some people I believe finding out if the coins can move is the most important thing at the moment. Whether or not the mover is Satoshi or not is almost secondary.
Try this thought experiment (which admittedly goes against the spirit of blockchain proof etc.). Imagine if somehow CW convinced everyone through other proof - social proof for example - that he was Satoshi. I think the most pressing question for many would still be "When are you going to move your coins?" :D
@_date: 2016-05-05 20:13:05
"blockchain" has got nothing on this!
@_date: 2016-05-05 17:25:05
For every post like this - looking at the complicated real-life possibilities (and quite a plausible one - team Satoshi being Kleiman/Wright/Hal ; coins lost with Kleiman ; etc.) - there are literally 100 vitriolic, hate-filled, aggressive, stupid... and basically outright terrified posts.
I guess a lot of people are scared that someone owns that much BTC. Can't think straight with that possibility in the back of the mind.
I'm not saying Craig Wright isn't being evasive, underhand, etc. rather that given the whole picture of his difficult financial affairs, using the BTC as collateral, and the fact that some significant people think he is genuine, it seems quite plausible to me that he could have been part of the Satoshi team and is now trying to make something out of an impossibly difficult situation, which is the fact that the coins are now lost. 
If the allegations about his financial affairs are true, the methods being employed to achieve his ends still don't mean he's NOT Satoshi. Just (in this hypothesis) not the 2D superman most people seem to hang on to.

One of the most interesting and useful things about reddit is being able to see comment history. Sock puppet accounts are often easy to spot.

Nice. Someone opens with "only speculation" and you close with "fool".
