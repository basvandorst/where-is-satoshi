An opinion rooted in the virtues of economics...

If I had any bitcoins I'd tip you. But I don't. Play me a song on the world's smallest digital violin.

But the volatility makes it nigh unusable. People tipping btc on reddit a couple years ago now gave away several thousand dollars. And likewise I could buy a car and tomorrow, if they don't exchange immediately, it could all be worth half of what it was. No way I'd want that chance as a merchant.

This makes much more sense. But it's still like a high risk stock or bond option that exposes the merchant to much more risk. Usually small business commerce wants to avoid risk and show stability. But maybe small, nimble institutions will adopt that strategy. But then people need to start using BTC, which still has the same risk factors with all the added instability of personal vs business finance. Someone is going to pay an exchange fee somewhere, which sucks.

Then why not just use local currency? If I have to exchange USD to Bitcoin then buy things and they just change it right back into dollars what's the point other than funding a bunch of middle men?

But it can't *control* how much it prints. It will continue at an asymptotically decreasing rate, unable to adjust itself for inflation, depression, or any other economic trend that is easily fixed by controlling the volume of currency. Once new bitcoins are no longer mined, it, by definition of inflation, will fail. And the USD has been around twice that long and is going strong, so 2140 is not really a great run.

Um no. If you think a currency that isn't under the control of a democratically responsible reserve and that will soon not be able to print more of itself will be successful and stable in the longterm then you are naive. Bitcoin is highly speculative right now, with investment and trading valued more than commerce. This is exactly what is wrong with the system *now.*

How does my argument lead you to that conclusion? No...Euros and dollars vary by a few percent a year. BTC has varied by hundreds of percent in the past few weeks. That's some serious volatility, and volatility that can't be controlled by a central reserve. It's pretty easy to control the inflation of the dollar and euro simply by changing currency volumes. Bitcoin doesn't have that luxury.

Just because it's unprecedented doesn't mean it's a black box that nobody understands. It's a currecy, or trying to be, so the fundamental rules of volume, flux, and inflation still apply. Where do you think I formed my opinion? I didn't pull it outta my ass, as you seem to want to do. God forbid we try and figure this out using things we know and not just disregard what we don't agree with. I'm not unfamiliar with Bitcoin. Do I use it everyday? No, but I've made some serious beermoney with it. It's not a terribly difficult concept to grasp. 
And my being unfamiliar with it would be a bad thing. In order for Bitcoin to actually function as a currency, it has to be accessible to people. You can't hoard this idea and have it work. Saying you don't understand it doean't help anybody, and it makes you sound incredibly pretentious.

I'm just asking "what's the utility?" To the everyday consumer, to the big item consumer, to the small merchant, and to the big ticket merchant. I've never bought anything with Bitcoin, but I've been buying and selling them for a while now, and made some good money. I like what Bitcoin does *for me*, but I'm kind of just a leech on the system.

[No, it doesn't.]( It adjusts based on an algorithm that maxes out eventually. The volume of miners doesn't matter. The rate determining step is the algorithm. Eventually, no more mining. It's already not profitable at an entry level, too.
