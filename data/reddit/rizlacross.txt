Personally I think that bitcoin has less intrinsic value as fiat money. ie it is not backed by anything but faith. Bitcoins are a digital currency, that are “minted” according to complex computer algorithms.They are under no central control, can be used as a medium of exchange and are untraceable, ie transactions are between wallets (which are usually anonymous) not account holders.
Now I have no doubt that faith in the digital currency could carry it, however I also believe that it could crash overnight. Its the same as investing in gold, as a buyer you hope that tomorrow's spot price will be higher as a seller lower. Everyone wants to sell at the highest and buy at the lowest price. That said price fluctuation can be of benefit. over the last year bitcoin has surged in value (from its original)
All that aside, the basics are that you need a bitcoin wallet. You can either have an online one ( I use blockchain), a must is a back up feature, or for added security a wallet that runs on your computer.
You can gain bitcoins through purchase, mining or earning them. Many affiliate programs offer bitcoins. I would play around with various ones to get a feel for the currency before any major investment. This is a good way to learn.  You won't get rich, but can earn a few through either affiliates, surveys or even bitcoin casinos.
