"I agree that I will get the Bitcoin exchange rate in effect at the time when BuyBitcoin.ph processes my payment and delivers pesos to me, not at the time I submit this form." - I see they're not taking on any currency risk at all.. but also give no indication of current volatility levels / how much you'll get for your money. Maybe they should send an email just before they process the payment, giving you a window to decline their offer?

Because investigative journalism is not a thing the BBC do these days.

Great site, but I fear directing them to MultiBit may scare a lot of people off. There needs to be an über simple (and secure) wallet that's dumbed down for those who aren't techies. Suggestions?

Andreas, this really surprises me.. as much as your talks are controversial in some circles I'm sure, you are merely a passionate effusive speaker on a topic you believe in. You may call (preach?) for change, but at this early stage where you don't have a following that poses any serious threat (for now, in a violent sense) other than inciting revolutionary ideas, are people really, seriously out to physically get / intimidate you? Who are these people?

So I ran the numbers off of the back of this, using the info available at [PNB Rates]( 
Including all service fees, as well as the commission they earn from juicing the exchange rate, it comes out to 12.3% to move the amount the article stated ($386 USD) from Hong Kong to Philippines, 11.93% to move $1000 USD. By contrast, Western Union-Western Union is 7.1%.

Couldn't you (Neo) and the third party collude to steal the customers BTC? (2 of 3 sigs of the multisig).

Suggested exactly the same to tux, no response.

Apologies, missed that. Why the decision to outsource vs. having your own people? What is the nature of the relationship with P&amp;V? Will you have FTEs who are committed to you? This is a highly technical operation.. the decision to not have your own people "dedicated to the cause" surprises me, and I feel adds unnecessary risk.

Same here, and recently upgraded to the T90's after a long search :) Very happy with both. It's like discovering music all over again!

Damnit, I thought this was going to be an Amazon-esque Mechanical Turk for BitCoin!

Who is supporting you on a technical level? I notice in the prospectus you don't yet have a CTO or make mention of any developers on board. Unless I missed it, I also don't see projections for the team/remuneration etc. What is the equity structure of the company going to be?
