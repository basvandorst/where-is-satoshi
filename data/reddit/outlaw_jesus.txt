I don't know if it's really true that people didn't want better communication than they had. For most of history sending long distance communication required either tremendous resources or tremendous luck. Every time an innovation was created (written language, staggered couriers, a postal system, the telegraph, etc) it was almost instantly adopted by everyone who had the means to do so. With long distance transfers of wealth we have seen people adopt innovations as created (promissory notes, national banking, electronic banking and money services, etc), but the demand hasn't lept up to meet the supply as it always has with communication technology.

Yes, bitcoin is more prone to theft than money stored at a bank, but this seems like a risk that the a consumer voluntarily assumes. Also, there's nothing preventing someone from keeping their coin with a (someday-to-be) financial service that has competent security (ie, professional, not gox) and the capital to insure against unauthorized transfers. This seems to be more an issue of the insufficient, newly developing financial services available to bitcoin users.
Can't set up a merchant account with digital fiat? There are *many* pay-pal like digital fiat services that do not require serious authentication and are perfectly sufficient for most black market purposes. Sure, you can't cash out directly to paper money, but with some creativity it's definitely doable (buying prepaid cards, trading for cash, etc). It's similarly difficult to turn bitcoin directly into cash without bringing in the bank and the IRS.
I'll give you that, bitcoin is definitely more volatile than USD, especially in it's fledgling state.
USD in paper form is way more anonymous than bitcoin. It's also possible to get digital USD online, just not thru a bank.

Lol gotta love the game play in this one. stuff like "kick a tree" and "buy a drink," or "set loose this monkey."

I don't regularly transfer money internationally so I don't know how/if bitcoin could be more convenient than WU, etc. I was just trying to address the "explain it to a migrant worker," which I took to either mean a barrier in communication or inability on behalf of the workers, neither of which I think are grounded.

Pretty much nothing besides support reddit. I would rather take the 30btc.

Trying to explain *anything* to someone who doesn't share your mother tongue is difficult, yet migrant workers prove competent at a whole host of jobs. Presumably the idea would be broached to them by Spanish speaking friends/family in the US or back home. Instructions and technology would presumably be in Spanish, by Spanish-speaking developers. If you look at Mexico in particular, I think they've shown some innovation in terms of payment services, and familiarity with bitcoin would come from back home, not from  some gringo techie.

How so? I've never been charged to access it nor have I seen any ads. Or do you mean not free to run? Or do you mean not free as in beer?

My guess is that OP holds the bitcoin for him.

Well, it *has* been used by the courts to clarify such words as "jack boys," "to nut," and "grenade" (referring to an ugly woman).

You simply share the public key with whoever you wish to communicate with. If you send them a 'signed' message encrypted to their public key it should provide it for them as well

Well it seems that chargebacks could be managed by a trusted third party escrow holder. This is how most silk road transactions are done, If I am not mistaken, and seems to fulfill the same purpose as chargebacks.
