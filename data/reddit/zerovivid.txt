First of all, congratulations!
If you don't already, you'll want to get the majority of your stash to a paper wallet or a hardware wallet; this way you're in control of the private keys.
Lending BTC is extremely dangerous, especially on places like btcjam. That said, It's unpopular to say here, but if you're confident in your ability to trade, there is money to be made selling peaks and rebuying your coins on the dips. Keep your trades reasonable, and don't risk more than you're willing to lose; also, don't try to get the timing perfect: rebuying before the absolute bottom and it falling further is better than waiting too long to buy back and getting left behind.
Stay calm, be smart, and welcome to the club. :)

I have no opinion on the creator of bitcoin. That said, there are agencies and individuals within the United States that would benefit from a currency that allows them to sidestep the central banks; not to mention the black OPs that could be funded at a later date with the coins mined early on in the project.
Personally, I hope we never know the origin of bitcoin. I think we need the myth.

It just seems to me that negative interests rates are the last trick we can use to prop this thing up. *Actual*  wealth cannot be created in this fashion; it *must*  be a colossal credit bubble, and that debt has to go somewhere.

Nothing has intrinsic value. Bitcoin does not derive it's value "from" carbon production. Bitcoin derives its value circularly through its user base. The traditional fiat currency system is way more wasteful in its production and maintenance than bitcoin.

Off-chain transactions will likely handle your coffee purchases in the future. 
That said, no one really knows how the network will scale, or what decisions will be made by developers or miners. It's certainly possible that the blockchain will only be used to settle large amounts, but I hope that some of the genius developers will come up with a solution that allows scalability while maintaining cheap direct access to the blockchain for everyone.
@_date: 2015-12-11 19:06:19
Back in my day it was e-mail. *shakes cane*
@_date: 2015-06-11 23:57:11
I simply mean that, depending on how the network deals with scalability, access to the blockchain could be limited to large transactions with substantial fees. This would eliminate the ability to buy your coffee with it and it would limit the poor from interacting directly with the blockchain, and would instead have to go through middlemen.
It is my hope that bitcoin scales in such a way that allows everyone to send a transaction directly on the blockchain, without having to deal with middlemen.

Assuming BTC keeps rising, the numbers wont always be so unreasonably huge. That said, i think the idea is that large numbers make people "feel" wealthier, which makes them feeeeel more comfortable buying more. The more people buy, the higher the price. The higher the price, the fewer bits you have to spend to get whatever item/service you desire. It's all about the feels.
@_date: 2014-10-05 10:58:02
Yes. Yes. Yes. This is exactly what I think is happening. If you obsessively watch the graphs and order-books on your days off, like I do, then it becomes clear that someone is deliberately selling through spots of low liquidity. Either someone hates money, or they want lower prices. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 11:24:58
It's not necessarily always about "predicting" markets. Having multiple screens allows one to keep the charts visible at all times, which makes rallies and dumps easier to spot as they are happening. Sure, a graph won't tell you where a rally or dump will begin or end, but it does allow you a few extra moments to get in or out ahead of the crowd that is paying less attention. :)

It would seem to me that the large banks must not really understand the threat Bitcoin poses to their industry. It would be trivial for such an institution to do major harm to the trust of BTC. When people consider attacking Bitcoin they tend to think along the lines of 51% hashing power; but attacking the price and trust of the currency would be far easier and more cost-effective. Someone with deep pockets could accumulate enough bitcoin to make the market swing around so wildly that the average joe would be scared to death of bitcoin. One percent of the bitcoin in circulation sold on an exchange could slam the price to ~$10. The attacker would then consolidate, rinse, and repeat. Considering the simplicity of this attack and the relatively thin orderbooks I am inclined to believe that the status quo really doesn't understand what they're up against, yet.

Imagine if public officials had to have a published BTC address. All financial contributions, all spending, everything would be right there in the ledger for everyone to see and critique. Sure, they could have a secret address for their corrupt affairs, but they would be unable to fund corrupt activities directly from their public address - as everyone would see the money move. You will be able to contribute to causes/campaigns and watch where the money goes, and hold accountable the individuals to whom you contributed much easier than you are today.

The fact of the matter is that the early internet was not user friendly; It was tedious and reserved for geeks. Now even your grandma can use the internet! Applications were built on top of the internet that made it easier to use. Bitcoin is still in its early days.
It's exciting to see the speed of innovation in this space though. We're starting to see the first second layer applications and that will in turn simplify wallet development, speed up transactions, and a multitude of other things. Soon bitcoin will be as simple as the internet.

I seem to remember reading one of the developers saying that it wouldn't be a problem until around January 2017, but I can't find the reference. Based on current trends though, the blocksize is not an issue, as long as the network is not being ~~tested~~ attacked by coinwallet.eu. The network functions fine. I am very confident that it will be quite some time before a solution to this problem will need to be implemented. I am also confident in the bitcoin development team.
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:48:52
Haha. Basically, the price has been in a steady decline, making the "bears" (traders with short positions, profiting when the price falls) very happy. The bulls (traders that profit when the price rises) have been trying to push the price up, but each time they make headway, the bears push it down, by selling more coin on the market. These coins being sold specifically to force a lower price are the "knives." One should be very careful when catching knives, they're sharp.
@_date: 2015-08-21 21:43:23
Then what is going to happen whenever there is no mining subsidy and we have eight gigabyte blocks? We would most likely end up with a drastic centralization of mining *and* verifying nodes.
Surely waiting for the solutions that actually scale is better. The lightning network looks very promising.
Edit: to answer your question, I'd rather be able to run a verifying node, and have to use a side channel to do transactions. Decentralization is important. It seems better to me. If I really needed direct access to the blockchain, I'd still have it. But with things like lightning, won't even need it in most cases.
@_date: 2015-08-20 19:29:19
It *will* scale. A solution will be adopted. Every one of the developers agrees that the blocksize will need to be increased. However, most of them don't think it's urgent.
Your implication that simple fee education isn't enough is disingenuous. If you know the proper fee to include at the time your transaction *will* get into a block quickly. Some wallets are even beginning to estimate the fee based on network load. 
We're not in some a state of emergency and we won't be for quite some time. I just hope enough people know this and we can take our time to adopt the **right** solution and not pick up the first one that comes along.
@_date: 2015-08-22 17:41:37

I will dump everything, and I know several people that will do the same. Classic is another coup attempt. If successful, bitcoin will have lost all real value in my eyes, and will have been reduced to a controlled centrally-planned speculative asset with no social contract.
@_date: 2016-02-02 00:41:58
Promises such as these: 
The 21 million coin hard cap. I see classic advocates discussing adding inflation to bitcoin, saying it's needed to subsidize the miners. This does away with the fee market that we were promised, in the whitepaper, would be allowed to naturally emerge.
Proof-of-work is how we were promised blocks would be mined and coins brought into existence. I've noticed some classic advocates saying we should use a proof-of-stake model instead.
We were promised a censorship-resistant money in the form of a digital asset. Some of the suggestions I hear coming from the classic advocates is that adoption is somehow more important than decentralization. That sacrifices have to be made so that the everyman will use it to buy everything.
This only names a few, after all, it's been made clear that in the classic model everything is up for vote. This isn't the bitcoin I was promised. :(
@_date: 2016-02-02 01:15:44
Bitcoin was laid out in the whitepaper. Anything less, is not what I was told bitcoin was.
I have nothing against larger blocks. I definitely think XT went too far, but surely a compromise can be found once it's necessary. I do think segwit and payment channels make sense to do first so that we can better gauge a reasonable blocksize. If a 2 megabyte increase makes the masses feel better then that could happen without any technical problems. Classic is about way more than blocksize. Classic is trying to put everything up for vote. This is more dangerous than XT ever dreamed of being.
@_date: 2016-02-02 05:57:00
I'm not really a reasonable guy, I just play one on the internet. :)
It's my view that Satoshi gave the miners the right to decide what is included in a block. If that means prioritizing transactions based on fees and size then that is their prerogative; however those transactions will be mined eventually. At this point I think it's fair to say if you're sending micro payments or a few Satoshi for a tip, it doesn't need priority. Mining is decentralized and competitive enough to keep the transactions flowing.
The lightning network is not functional because it's not able to get past its current stage of development until segwit is implemented. Segwit does exist and is going to be rolled out soon.
From a purely technical level: The perceived blocksize emergency is way overblown. And it had caused a lot of hostility amongst our community and against the core devs. I understand certain people's desire to be a part of "change," but change should be the right change. We don't need to hard fork the bitcoin blockchain to prove a political point that we can. We know we can because, like you said, that is how bitcoin was designed. The core developers aren't opposed to a hard fork, they just understand that it's a delicate 6 billion dollar project, and the want to be careful. I admit that a 2mb blocksize isn't a technical problem, but I don't see it accomplishing much. A better solution to blocksize would be to implement things such as segwit first and then get a metric for how much it improved throughout and formulate a BIP based on that data to handle the blocksize issue once and for all. Raising it to 2 and then needing to expand later through another hard fork is cumbersome and not very elegant.
Everything should be up for a vote within the boundaries set within the whitepaper. The whitepaper is the constitution on which we were founded. Things such as the coin cap, proof of work, etc should not be up for vote. Whether or not the software allows it ,due to its open nature, doesn't mean it should be done. If you ignore the foundation it's no longer the same thing.
I am confident that the blocksize will be raised and in an adequate timeframe. The 1 megabyte hard cap was intended to be temporary, and it will be. I just do not think dividing the community into factions and trying to force a fork that solves nothing and serves only to "prove a point to those core devs" or "because we can" is worth it.
If it comes time for a fork, if the core developers start violating the principals listed in the whitepaper, you better bet I'll jump aboard. But as it stands, I see XT and classic as reckless.
It's late, I hope I made my points in a non rambling manner and didn't come off as rude.
@_date: 2016-02-01 23:09:25
By social contract, I am referring to the promises laid out in the beginning. Classic threatens to democratize everything, reducing it to a "governed by the people" model as opposed to self governing. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 02:15:26
I think the majority of the backlog comes from "spam" or low-priority transactions. I never said 2 mb was unreasonable. I think 2 megs would work fine, though the benefits of doing so would be marginal. 
Yes I mean payment channels such as the lightning network. Saying it doesn't exist, while true on its face, doesn't mean that it's not being worked on. People pretending that a solution was needed yesterday are either being disingenuous or are using bitcoin incorrectly. I'm not opposed to hard forks in general. I'm opposed to not giving the conservative methods a fair go before looking to alternatives.
Classic may be "just a client," but with that client comes a change to a whole new governance structure that seeks to turn bitcoin into a democracy where *everything* is up for vote. I don't see this as any better than what we have today with centrally planned economics around the world. It will be really sad to me if we go down this road. I thought bitcoin was different.

I understand the need to scale. We're getting attention from institutions and people we could have only dreamed of a year ago. That said, bitcoin *must* scale *with* bandwidth; we must not make assumptions that bandwidth will scale with bitcoin, that's dangerous.
We need a blocksize increase. We need the code relating to blocksize cap to manage itself. We must not out pace residential bandwidth. It's a really hard problem.

Why would you stop supporting or endorsing bitcoin? Because the bubble popped, or some other underlying reason?
@_date: 2015-09-03 22:15:01
It helps manage fees with blocksize growth. I am not sure, but perhaps the "floor" should slowly chase upwards, so there couldn't be a situation where 20% could derail things; they could only lower blocksize to the newly established floor.
I'm not sure how this mechanism would work in detail though.

Hiding a backdoor among seemingly harmless or functional code can be really really simple for a very clever developer.

The party that is receiving funds would have an account of their own. One could even set up the merchants settings so that all the btc sent to that Coinbase account is withdrawn to fiat instantly and appears in (3 to 5 business days) in the person's bank account.

I certainly don't fault you for offering these delicious products to U.S. customers. It's just a shame for the consumer that the regulatory environment causes this distortion in the market between supply and demand.
Good for you filling the niche!

See all those upvotes? That means it's fact.

Sure it does. Coinbase eats any blockchain fees, and the transfer will be instant if sent to another Coinbase account. This lets you do remittances fairly cheaply and with minimal friction.

Known as the "Konami code," this cheat does a number of things in various games made by Konami. In Contra it grants the player 30 lives; in Gradius 3 it will blow up your ship and take a life, unless you use the L &amp; R triggers on top of the SNES controller instead of left and right on the D-pad, in which case it would give your ship all the upgrades.

"Imho" makes no sense to use here, as the default behavior is not an opinion.
Also, the default behavior of AVG is to remove the file and tell you about it later.

Agreed. Property binaries should be rejected by the bitcoin community as a whole. No source? No execute.

"Adblock is theft," are you serious? You feel that running software that removes unwanted and invasive elements in my browser is somehow immoral? Please.

I would want to aim for a about 75% of residents to be able to run a full verifying node. It's a difficult challenge. Of course bandwidth will increase over time, thus allowing larger blocksize. But assumptions are dangerous. Is there a possible way to poll a nodes capacity in a decentralized manner? If &gt; X% of nodes can push larger blocks then increase by a hardcoded value.
I'm no expert. But it's an idea I've not had discussed.
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:25:28
Processor speed and storage aren't the problem with BIP101; the problem is the assumptions it makes about the future of bandwidth.

I retain hope that this is a stall allowing everyone to double down on their shorts before lift off.

I completely agree that a once compromised machine needs to be formatted. However, if significant money is involved, please get it to a hardware wallet asap. Internet connected devices aren't to be trusted.

Must have been forced by the editor to remove the word bitcoin, so they just did a search and replace. It reads much better if you replace the second "blockchain" with "bitcoin."

I think the assumption is that the underground economy is bound to succeed, therefore giving anyone that buys bitcoin low (including banks) an economic advantage. While the business model of what banks do may change, staying ahead of the curve could establish them as a third party wallet/holder of coins, like Coinbase. Pivoting your business is preferred to going under entirely.

He simply said it's beta software. Version numbers indicate this fact.

Because that is what he specifically asked about. Your comment adds nothing to the thread.

Try: ChangeTip is a great service! One thing I'd really like to see is the ability to customize the button graphic.
