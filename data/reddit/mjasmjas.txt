Anyone who want to destroy bitcoin needs to first garner support from the community, after you have the support you use it to throw sticks in the wheels. 
Let's be realistic, this is a person who got tricked into publicly announcing that some person I can't remember the name of is Satoshi. Think how easy it would be for CIA agents to trick him into believing bitcoin actually is a Russian or Chinese invention meant to subvert USA's financial standing in the world, and DESTROY AMERICA!
I have always found his pro-government stance unappealing and a reason for suspicion. He actually thinks the NIST report on 9/11 is factual, let that sink in. He is either a CIA asset or just plain dumb.
Just scan through his twitter and it will become apparent to anyone that this person has no interest in seeing bitcoin succeed.

The single most damaging action one person did to bitcoin was done by Gavin: changing the name of the first and most popular bitcoin client to bitcoin core. This single action was a very important action for the enemies of bitcoin. To be able to have a divide and conquer scheme there must be clear sides. Without a strong name that distinguish one implementation from another it becomes much harder to trick people into fighting each other over trivial matters like blocksize.

Yes, I truly believe that. What is your impression of what happened? You believe the fairy tale of an evil dictator that the super hero USA must stop? come one, Libya was the richest country in Africa, it had European living standard, why would anyone in Libya want to start an uprising to remove Gaddafi? 
I hope you are woke enough to have pieced together the fact that USA has no interest in "helping" any middle eastern country if they don't have some resource the USA want, especially oil. By "helping", I of course mean airdropping a couple tons of explosive on hospitals, weddings, civilian housing and infrastructure, AKA instant democracy.

Gaddafi wanted to trade the libyan oil in gold dinar, a new African currency made from gold. What happened? well, US and its western cronies was not having that, they wanted to buy the oil with their own worthless FIAT currency, practically giving them free oil. What did they do? pretty much the same thing they are doing in Syria now: Paying mercenaries to fake a civil uprising against the "evil" dictator, spreading the lie in western media, and bombing the shit out of the country. 
Libya is now free, with its very own Rothschild/IMF backed central bank.
"Democracy" FTW.

It's not possible to withdraw FIAT from bitfinex, people buy BTC there and sell them on other exchanges to get their FIAT.
I bet a lot of the coins end up at bitstamp, hence the low price there.
Someone really want FIAT, fast:

@_date: 2017-04-19 20:48:41


True, but that's not what is happening. No bank is holding back money. This is what has happened:
You have bitcoin at bitfinex, you sell them for USD, now you want to withdraw them to your bank account, but bitfinex has no bank it can use to send the USD to your account. It's like there is no road between two points, or more precisely; there is a road but bitfinex is not allowed to use it.
@_date: 2017-04-14 19:02:03

Gavin did his job good with renaming Bitcoin to bitcoin core, without a distinctive name a divide and conquer scheme would be almost impossible.  
If it was Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Unlimited the choice would be obvious, but change that to Bitcoin Core vs Bitcoin Unlimited and the choice is not as obvious anymore. 
Good work Gavin, CIA apparently trained you well. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 18:57:30


Not really, for a person living in Europe and buying bitcoin with EUR there is no exchange with better terms than Bitstamp. Maybe you consider exchanges with worse terms an option, I don't.

Of course it did, because no one is using litecoin, if litecoin was bitcoin we would say "should we use bitcoin?, 0 fee confirms fast".
Is that not obvious?
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:15:14
Your first transaction that was sent with 70s/B has not confirmed, so your second transaction which is trying to spend coins from the first transaction will not confirm until the first transaction has confirmed.
Why did you send a transaction with 70s/B if you knew you needed to spend it again fast? because you knew that it could take a long time for it to confirm, right?
Almost look like you intentionally created this scenario for yourself so you could post another "my transaction is stuck" post. Hard to imagine someone being that daft when you obviously is not a bitcoin noob and know about the bitcoin fee structure.
