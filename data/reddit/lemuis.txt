@_date: 2014-01-28 03:14:56
no. why?
edit: possibly. :/
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:47:34
It's not a scam as far as I know. They just underestimate the whole thing by a lot.

ah you're right. oops.
I see how it can be confusing :P

not long before these kind of things also start appearing on FaceBook and YouTube.
@_date: 2014-08-28 03:27:05
You could also ask: why is everyone so sure that a week consists of 7 days forever?
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:26:58
That "C" keeps hurting my eyes.
Facebook, not FaceBook.
Youtube, not YouTube.
Android, not AnDroid.
Bitcoin, not BitCoin.
@_date: 2014-01-28 03:29:58
I see. Yeah I was a bit too fast with my reply. You've actually got a very valid point. I do feel that the other people you named are not as dumb as Charlie Shrem though, but the US gov't can play dirty games.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:41:29
haha so misleading... I also didn't read the "via BitPay" part

I've been here every day for the last two years (mostly just reading stuff), but this it. I'm unsubscribing.
This is complete bullshit. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 21:29:30
Great, I live in Lausanne :)
What date/time will the one at EHL be?
Btw: awesome that you are doing this! Good luck with the preparations!
@_date: 2016-05-25 02:17:06
I have also been out of the loop for a while, but that sounds like a great solution. When will this take effect?

What uni is this? If it's my uni I would definitely swing by.
@_date: 2016-07-30 02:08:07
I used to like them so much but it seems to get worse by the day.
Their verification system doesn't work for me and support said there is no way around at the moment, so I withdrew the last few Bitcoin I had on the exchange (Bitcoin I bought before verification was required). Now they increased their fees from 1 to 1.5% and they suddenly start to promote Ethereum. Nothing wrong with Ethereum but I like to buy Bitcoin and not get spam emails about Ethereum. Ok sorry for the complaining. It's just stupid it's so hard nowadays to buy Bitcoin in the U.S (not really Coinbase's fault OK).. It used to be so easy a few years ago.
I got verified with Kraken, which was very easy. Only problem there is they only accept wire transfer which my bank charges 30 USD for. Ok if you want to transfer a lot of money but not very useful for people who only want to buy a little bit of Bitcoin (100 USD or so).  
@_date: 2013-07-17 02:17:50
They will probably loose a lot of customers. At least that's a good thing (for the decentralization of the exchanges).
@_date: 2013-04-27 21:16:31
what client do you use? probably it hasn't synchronized yet. restarting the client may help.
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:00:06
I bought some yesterday too, but can't tell you if it was a wise investment.
The price has gone up very steep lately. By just looking at the figures, you would expect it to crash sometime. However, the number of people taking part in this whole thing has also increased steeply, so I don't think this is a bubble that will pop sometime. 
But who am I to tell you, this is only my first investment and I've only been in this for two weeks.
Anyway, hopefully next month 1BTC = 150USD
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:49:55
I've reported this douchebag 10 times already. Why doesn't reddit block him?
@_date: 2013-10-19 02:20:35
great, you can send them to 14DWuaWh6PkNsb8tSwv2RKTyS9z1o46qKi
@_date: 2013-05-30 03:12:10
Possibly, but that's not a bad thing. If such a thing becomes a full-time job, the person waiting in line should pay tax though.
@_date: 2013-07-28 22:23:40
Same here. I did move here only a few months ago. Not sure if that has to do with it.
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:37:12
it's quite funny that their homepage says: "Reliable. We're always on. Buy and sell Bitcoin 24/7/365 with the world's most sophisticated trading platform."
But yeah.. I'm fine with MtGox being DDOSed too. This hopefully encourages initiatives for creating new bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:03:04
Worst mistake in your life. Price may fall from 230USD to 23USD in a month's time and your 20k will then be worth 2k.
@_date: 2013-03-25 14:59:25
I agree that these posts are useless, but I still like them :P
@_date: 2013-05-31 04:03:51
"If someone looks at a gem that is priced at thousands of dollars they will think it's a very valuable gem. Something worth having."
What about gold? Most people certainly think gold is something worth having, yet, they don't buy it because they think it's too expensive. Most of them don't know you can also buy small amounts of gold for a few hundred or a few thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:48:24
Could be a bear trap too. If so, I expect we will see 2000, 3000 or even 4000 in the next few weeks, before crashing and stabilizing around 1000. This based on the fact that we keep stabilizing at round numbers like 0.1, 1, 10 and 100.
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:00:08
I think so too. In fact, I kind of hope that it will drop for a while so I can buy more for cheap. I'll be starting my first job in a few weeks, so will have more money soon :P
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:16:19
haha awesome, my first reddit tip :) I'll have to find out how this thing works and will pay it forward ;)
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:20:34
I would also tip if I can send it to a Bitcoin address, because I like to stay anonymous. Does Tippercoin support this?
@_date: 2013-05-31 02:33:17
agree, let's make it 1024 to at least make it sound a bit nerdy. 
let's then call it a bytecoin to make it also confusing for nerds.
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:55:58
I'm sure people who feel like they put a bit too much of their savings into Bitcoin will pay with Bitcoin to make up for it. Maybe not this week as prices are only rising, but next week it may be the other way around.
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:37:10
I found out about reddit through Bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2013-07-04 08:27:53
This is great for Bitcoin, keep up the good work!
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:57:56
Just wondering, how long do these DDOS attacks at MtGox usually take?
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:44:30
I'm sure you can afford 1 BTC. Just buy one and enjoy the rollercoaster :)
@_date: 2013-03-18 20:35:18
maybe some other exchange, but not mtgox 
@_date: 2013-07-04 05:48:05
Hi JakeMcVitie,
Thanks for your concerns. If you have issues with Gox, you s...
@_date: 2013-07-26 03:51:47
Assume everyone on the planet uses Bitcoin and generates 1000 private keys a second. Now assume that this goes on for a million years long. Would you still believe it is a flaw when the chance that in this million years two duplicate private keys are generated, is one million times smaller than the chance a big meteorite hits the earth and kills everybody?
I'm just making up these numbers, but I hope you get the point. 
@_date: 2013-06-01 04:07:56
Awesome! I think the younger generation will be an important factor to the success of Bitcoin as they are typically very open to new things like social media back then and Bitcoin now.
@_date: 2013-10-24 06:51:55
keep dreaming. this is only the beginning.

Funny to read this post again. It's one month later now and Liberty Reserve is gone. Bitcoin unaffected ;)
@_date: 2013-08-22 03:45:56
no they don't. some day hopefully
@_date: 2013-07-14 04:15:27
yeah that's probably more likely, although nothing is impossible.

What exactly has all this to do with Bitcoin? Do you want to know the local news of my country too?
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:02:29
if a cashier makes an error and gives you 50 dollars change instead of 10 dollars, are you also going to keep the extra 40 dollars?
@_date: 2013-07-26 16:12:34
I like this :)
@_date: 2013-07-14 00:43:22
We're  talking about less than 1 USD cent here. Why even bother?
@_date: 2013-06-09 20:26:23
I just moved to the US to work here for half a year and had the same problem with Bank of America. They keep your money behind for a whole week.
edit: well actually, they did give me 10% right away. How nice of them!
@_date: 2013-03-18 10:11:44
I'll make sure to sell all my bitcoins if they get associated with guns. I don't understand what people like about the idea of guns. Maybe it's because I'm not from the US.
@_date: 2013-06-17 02:55:18
great idea!
@_date: 2013-07-14 00:38:19
Nah they just took it off the exchange for security reasons and will move it back on the exchange when we reach 1000 USD/BTC next month or so.
@_date: 2013-05-30 06:47:45
such a system would basically be useless as anyone can disrupt it by spamming the network with a billion of transactions worth 0.0000000000000000001 dollar each
@_date: 2013-05-04 14:47:13
you actually selected both yesterday and today, which is misleading as the day in the US is only just starting while it almost past in China.
This gives the actually statistics for yesterday: 
@_date: 2013-10-09 04:32:56
This is only good for the decentralization of Bitcoin, which we should all support. The role the US plays in Bitcoin is too dominent. Hehe just trolling you guys ;)
@_date: 2013-03-18 20:46:43
my fault, you're right!
@_date: 2013-06-25 05:32:21
you mean "stable" right?
@_date: 2013-10-15 02:58:06
Same here, but my parents hold euros, not dollars. They are about to retire and I'm afraid that their purchasing power keeps decreasing like it has been over the past few years. I could suggest them to buy some bitcoin, gold or silver but I know they won't anyway. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:09:52
that's what I thought when I bought my first coin for less than 50 USD while it was surging beginning of this year.
@_date: 2013-08-22 02:53:46

PANIC BUYYYYY!!!
