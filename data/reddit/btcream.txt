This is actually good news

Jokes aside, these seem like the most likely reasons. Forgive my ignorance, but when  you say "liquidity," do you mean that it's easier for the investor to buy and sell large quantities (from the hedge fund) at once? 
And you mean that investors can short the fund itself (buy options, etc) as a proxy for shorting or buying options on BTC (the markets for which are currently not very deep)?

One of us should start making a dated list of every news article proclaiming the death of bitcoin. And then put the list at  It would be nice to be able to direct the btc morticians to it.

That would be very useful. Perhaps consider allowing users to add events/edit the timeline so that a high level of granularity can be established, ie hour-by-hour. There may be events affecting the price on a short-ish timescale that any one moderator might not know about, ie: at 3:07 a 3000 BTC wall was put up at xx price.

Maybe Goldman is the Trojan infiltrating bitcoin, and they will neuter bitcoin by centralizing mining, which will be especially tempting when we approach the 1mb transaction limit and mining is no longer profitable for the common person.

Me too! I'd been meaning to get around to buying some. Ability to pay w BTC gave me the nudge
@_date: 2014-06-04 18:26:13
So then bitcoin's main advantage will disappear once bitcoin goes mainstream?
Edit: thanks for the gold u/buttcoinsatan! I'm actually seeking answers to my questions though, not just trying to choose my arguments based on my conclusions. 
I think it will be possible to prevent the erosion of bitcoin's decentralization. Perhaps the endgame will be 5-10 large mining pools or mining companies. This would still be, in my opinion, a vast improvement over the legacy banking system.

Why would a wealthy investor invest in a BTC hedge fund (or ETF for the matter) instead of just buying BTC?
Is it just to avoid volatility? Because if you're going for a long term hold strategy (which presumably hedge fund investors are), volatility really doesn't matter.

No such thing as insider trading on forex markets, same goes for bitcoin

Right, that's partially my point. You can cash in on the growth by buying BTC just as easily as buying btc hedge fund, no?
