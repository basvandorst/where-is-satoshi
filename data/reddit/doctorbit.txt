Satoshi is kind of like Doctor Who - he regenerates every few years in a new body.

Sounds like Elizabeth Rossiello didn't pay enough bribes.

One bitcoin every two weeks would add up to 26 bitcoins per year.

I suppose you could deposit double-spend bitcoins on an exchange and then trade the bitcoins for altcoins and withdraw the altcoins before unveiling the 51% attack.  Right now there aren't enough altcoins for sale on all the exchanges put together to launder $10M.  If altcoin market caps grow, that could change.  The other things you mention would create widespread havoc - but profit, not so much. 
It's really not clear to me how someone could profit *greatly* from a 51% attack, especially in the future, with law enforcement monitoring of blockchains and the dominant exchanges regulated and complying with AML-KYC.   Another analogy would be bouncing a check for $10M, or lots of checks that total that amount.
When tens of millions of dollars are lost, people and governments pay attention, and are willing to spend a lot of time and money to recover the loss. Am I overlooking anything here?

Thanks Andreas, I love your talks.  Great job talking to the Canadian senate too.  I've sent a link to that video to quite a few friends.
I think there's a pretty serious math error in the "15 smileys" thing though.  Base 128 != 128 bits, rather Base 128 = 7 bits because 2^7 = 128.  In other words each smiley represents 7 bits, giving 128 possible values for those 7 bits.  Really it would take 293 smileys to convey 256 bytes.

By "Nothing would be more profitable", I imagine you mean profit of say 10 million dollars?  Even if your double-spend succeeds technically, you can't just rip someone off for tens of millions of dollars and expect to not get prosecuted legally.  It's really no different than paying for something with a stolen credit card or doing a charge back and keeping the merchandise.  Or promising to pay cash later and then not showing up. If you bought a house, a lien could be placed against the title.  If you bought Lamborghinis, they could be repossessed.

Blockchain needed because employees within the company don't trust each other.

Blockchain.info doesn't show a block for that date and time. Block number?  
Edit  It looks like the bitcoinrichlist.com datetime display is time-zone dependent.  On my system it shows as Sep 6, 2014 5:31:10 PM.  
Edit  Blockchain.info shows the time as 2014-09-07 00:31:10.  It's Block  Transaction bf5be9f4843c22f5022236ab0b0bfd5fd10a56882e5574ff4145828bc26bb5b1  
It looks like someone was just spamming large addresses with one satoshi each.  Nothing to see here, move along!

I bet you have a credit card and a bank account.  IMO, bitcoin will take off first among the unbanked - most people in the third world, and poor people and teenagers in the developed world who want to send money or make purchases over the internet. 
Once bitcoin becomes widely established in those markets, I think use will spread to middle and upper-class people in the developed world who will by then have the option of receiving their income directly in bitcoin from companies that sell products or services to the aforementioned markets - with a bonus for saving their employer exchange fees.  What middle class person wouldn't want to reduce their bank interactions?
Once you've got a significant proportion of middle class people receiving part of their income in bitcoin, it's easy to imagine an exponential growth rate for bitcoin in the developed world.  Contrary to oft-stated views in this sub, banks will not go away as people still need mortgages and business loans.  Credit cards will not go away as people still want to conveniently buy things on credit.
Where will banks and credit-card companies get the money to lend out?  Banks will have to return to the days of actually paying interest to depositors!  So you could be faced with the choice of keeping your bitcoin conveniently in your wallet in complete safety but no interest payments, or depositing it in a bank - with all the hassles and risk involved in that - and receiving interest.

The price is dropping because people are selling too much.
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:24:37


The true price of smartphones has just this year dropped to levels affordable by third-world people.  Third-world people are not going to be using desktops or laptops or tablets to send bitcoin, they will be using cheap smartphones (less than $30, no contract)


How so?


True, but these things don't significantly hurt, either.  Imagine a Trezor-like device for $5 the size of a usb key. Not so difficult. In the third world, they don't have FDIC insured accounts, and people bury their money in their bedroom, or keep  it in their boot.  If someone in the third world wants to give money to their grandma in the next village, they have to travel there to give it to her.  If they want to buy something from Amazon, fuggetaboutit! Bitcoin doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be better than the methods people are currently using.

Very insightful, thank you!

I'd try contacting Elizabeth Rossiello:
She's the CEO of BitPesa:
@_date: 2017-05-08 19:03:18
That was actually really insightful.  I was going to post a link to a picture of "Bagdad Bob" before I read it.  I'm glad I didn't :)

Because they don't have any.

If the fraudsters produce an alternative version of the blockchain as evidence supporting their fraud, how would the court decide which is the correct blockchain version?  How would that decision process differ from a court deciding which copy of an ordinary distributed database is the correct copy?  It's not clear to me that adding "blockchain" reduces the legal complexities.

If someone had the keys to those blocks, why would they leave $200,000 of bitcoin just sitting there?  With those keys they could spend the bitcoin from those blocks.

Do you really think that the NSA or China, or Russia, could not hijack the banking network whenever they want just by devoting a couple billion in bribes, hacking and intimidation to it?
@_date: 2015-02-06 15:29:54
Sounds like they need to do more penetration testing.
