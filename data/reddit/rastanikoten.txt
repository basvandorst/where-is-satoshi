I agree and offer my thoughts




The control of Bitcoin is composed of the willfulness of miners to execute the software program developed by Satoshi and further developed by the Bitcoin core development team. It is a very democratic and open platform and public utility where majority consensus rules and anyone has the power to add value.


The cryptography of Bitcoin employs several strategies for layered and fundamentally unbreakable security.  It is challenging to convey the specifics but I find that the most practical detail to explain to the average person is that transactions are irreversibly, digitally signed with a secret number so long and complex it could never be guessed exactly in a trillion years even with a super computer the size of the Sun, and this secret number is called a "private key" and should be safeguarded. Whoever controls the private key can authorize a spend. It is difficult but possible to memorize the key but it is best kept on specialized computers designed for key storage, something called a hardware wallet. The only bitcoin ever hacked was from those who would not control a private key to their funds. Because signing a transaction is a one-way process which can never be reconstructed by an observer, the medium over which your transaction traverses can be insecure. This eliminates man-in-the-middle vulnerabilities that traditional payment networks have. The mass data theft from retailers we have seen are not possible but there is still similar risk if trusting knowledge of a private key to a third party.  The practical benefit of bitcoin is that the transaction is pushed from your wallet rather than pulled from your account. This push mechanism is why digital currency will succeed credit cards. 


The rate of new money supply with Bitcoin is well defined but this ridged definition is a matter of taste. Personally, I am not pleased how it awarded early adopters because I wasn't one of them.  Lucky dogs!




This is true.  I want a blockchain public broadcast ledger capable of storing video so true history can withstand revision. 


The complexity of security can be understood and possible to obtain for most. I like a cell phone Trusted execution environment. 


This. This is a true problem for a person evaluating risk. The value has not been suitably stable for a long period and puts off investors. Some will say its much more like a purely speculative tech stock than a currency.

I have almost 10% growth in my Bitcoin at BTCJam after the first 21 days of using the site. I had a few overdue loans but by listing trade notes at 50% value and selling some of them, I have reduced losses by one third. One major reason I was able to increase my BTC by so much was because Bitcoin has fallen in price significantly in August and my BitstampUSD linked loans are around two thirds of my investments. I am also using the third-party site BTCJamTop.com to review credit risk. I feel that my lending experience on the site is very positive and its going to make me a lot of Bitcoin.

You said: 


You haven't read about Bitcoin insurance. There are a number of insurance providers insuring Bitcoin these days. You can see Great American announced in June they are covering Commercial and Government Bitcoin: 
What protection are you seeking? FDIC insurance covers you when the bank becomes insolvent or gets robbed. It insures your deposit accounts, including: Checking accounts, Savings accounts, Money market deposit accounts, Certificates of deposit. 
Bitcoin secures your funds with the exclusive knowledge of a private key. Only individuals having your private key can spend your funds. You can keep your private key in your head if you wanted to do so. How can anyone steal your funds then? 
Maybe you are saying that you can't guarantee your Bitcoin will sustain its price value. This may be true right now, because Bitcoin is treated like Property and not like Currency. The difference between a property and a currency is its liquidity and price stability. Well, soon, companies will offer a product where you can hedge the value of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin goes down, your account balance remains pegged to US Dollars.

Of course your nonsense is going to seem logical to you.
I have a pretty good idea of what I am doing. I specialize in system development of risk analysis.  I'm a Business Systems Analyst for a Fortune 100 financial services company by day and I'm a bitcoin loan shark by night. 
I have only been lending BTC for a few weeks. I only invest in 7-90 day loan terms. I've got 97 open loan investments, 31 repaid loan investments and 4 loan investments which are overdue. I will be able to know in a couple of months how I am really doing as my portfolio builds and first-time payments on the longer term loans become due. So far, I've earned 10% of my initial investment back in interest alone which I've re-invested. My calculated Net Annualized Return (NAR) is several hundred percent. 
If I take 1 BTC and invest 0.01 BTC into 100 loans and 10 default, as long as I earn more than 10% back on 90 I'm breaking even. The interest rates are far higher than 10% and I can use credit risk analysis to minimize my percentage of defaults.  There's a lot more variables to track. Some loans are pure BTC, some are linked to USD. With BTC falling 20% of its previous value this week, the performance of my USD-linked loans is 1208% NAR.

I am a former Retail Systems Analyst. I have worked on three POS systems: IBM, LOC SMS, and NCR ACS. Anyway, it would be a simple thing to integrate Bitcoin into any of these POS systems. These systems often have http daemons so they can host a simple webpage displaying a Coinbase or BitPay API checkout page with a QR code and brief instructions. Open source command line utilities exist to render and convert webpages to a variety of formats which may include or be converted into monochrome PostScript, which can be outputted to the receipt printer. The POS system has its own interface for talking to electronic validation systems like credit, debit, EBT, and gift card systems so writing a small program to talk to the POS and to the APIs of BitPay or Coinbase provider is trivial. I guess the project cost would be prohibitive unless a lot of people want to pay with Bitcoin.

Well, they may be able to check the balance with the public key / wallet address, but perhaps not reliably.  Depends on the wallet used and the number and type of transactions. 
The private key is to protect spending, not verification. BIP38 protects the private key. Is your public key next to it or not present? A lot of paper wallets print it right next to the BIP38 encoded private key.

I have a strange philosophy that computers are like ink pens and bananas. Like ink pens because they have limited use. You expend the ink in the thing (MTBF on components, wear and tear, etc) and after a quantity of use it's worn out and time to throw the thing away to be recycled. Like bananas because there's only so much time that a computer is 'ripe' to use. Obsolescence factor. There's a shelf life to the useful value of the thing which I think for computers is about 2-4 years. I don't really care what computer I'm using because I go through so many. With Windows, I can usually reliably get my game on. With Linux, not so much.

* You tried to send a transaction and include a fee of 0.000001 which is 1/100th of what it ought to be. 
* Your transaction was not processed by miners because of the low fee and became a lost/dead confirmation.
* The transaction is discarded by most software but somehow a ghost in Blockchain.info (poor programming?)
* You may be able to fix this in two possible ways
    
      Get the TX confirmed by a pool, if it's even possible at this point

I intended the indicative present perfect verb tense. I meant that currently 70% is paid back. I was considering just the past six months. You should trust this site. You can download their database and review the historical loan data yourself. 
If about 1/3rd of people don't pay back their loans, and the average APR of your investments is 33.33%, then you break even.  Every portfolio is different. My portfolio has a mean APR greater than 33.33% and has a very low rate of overdue payments. Fewer than 10% of my investments are unpaid. 
Addendum: I was incorrect. If we solve 66 (loans) × x/100 (APR) = 100 (loans), x = 5000/33 ~~ 151.52% average APR to break even at equal distribution to every loan investment listing.

Or do, because the rest of the statement can be evaluated as 'False' and isn't convincing.


Over 70% of all Bitcoin loaned out through BTCJam is paid back which we can inspect over at [BTCJammer](


*Caveat emptor*. Technically. that depends on what your definition of 'allows' and 'steal' are but a better way to describe what is happening is that BTCJam is unable to guarantee that a potential borrower will pay back a loan. It is up to the lender to make diversified investments, review the borrower's credit profile, and/or interview borrowers for convincing reason to lend - in order to mitigate risk and make wise investing choices. If a lazy lender were to sort the listings by APR and invest into loans with high return value... They would find themselves at a mathematical disadvantage in the non-prime market.

Do you know how BitTorrent works? Because it's just like that. 


On the hard drives of nodes. It's redundantly stored.


Miners do not need to store the entire blockchain. 
 &gt;if the answer is yes, wouldn't the size of all the transactions that are being recorded ever since bitcoin was invited be incredibly huge?
Bitcoin transactions are small and measured in bytes. Block 320012 has 298.87 kilobytes and 1024 transactions for an average of about 300 bytes a transaction. 
The entire block chain is about 22 GB in size right now. The number of transactions are at an all time high, too. 
In relationship of 22 GB to 5 years of operation isn't much but it will increase. I think it will always be manageable. My organization of 200 people store 1 TB of email each year. There is concern about bloat in the block chain. You can store data in a transaction. People send spam in the block chain. People put happy valentines day messages and merry Christmas messages in the block chain. Some asshole put Child Porn images in the block chain. 
The eXChange Protocol (XCP) of Counterparty is a securities transaction protocol and coin residing in the messages on bitcoin transactions. 
Anyway... hard drives ship in terabytes and terabytes. So there's no worry. You can get a microsd card the size of my pinky fingernail that holds 128 GB for about $40.

Bitcoin rewarded early adopters. It is designed to do so. It does this by having a monetary policy that halves the block reward. The initial reward was 50 BTC per block and after block 210,000 the reward halved to 25 BTC. At block 420,000 (estimated Reward-Drop ETA: 2016-08-05 13:29:02 UTC in about 100 weeks, 3 days, 11 hours, 50 minutes by the bitcoin clock) the reward will halve to 12.5 BTC. 
Consequently, as the reward goes down and the demand goes up the price goes up so the lucky people who had thousands of worthless Bitcoin in 2010 and beyond can now be millionaires. This may be perceived to be an unfair advantage to onlookers. Who knows. The early adoption phase may be over... or it may yet be far from over. Will Bitcoin go to the moon? What kinds of people are these sudden millionaires? They are mostly techies. Techies are usurping monetary power all around the world with the deflationary economics of Bitcoin.

I did some crunching. It looks like it really could go either way but so far it's better than the stock market.
I have only been doing this for 17 days. I started with a small amount (about USD$140) to test the water. In the first couple of days,I invested in a couple of high-interest loans from Indonesia which I will never do again. I am better at spotting scams. I have learned to include Gross National Income per Capita in my credit risk analysis and to only contribute relatively to small loans. I think my default rate will decrease now that I have had some practice at picking the prime borrowers. I am now evaluating every metric against loan history. I plot distribution of Repaid and Default loans and compare the borrowers metrics to those two groups.
So let's calculate how I'm really performing:
0.24276087 Initial Deposit
0.36419925 = Total Loaned (Includes re-investments)
0.18470671 Total Received (Includes interest)
0.01828253 Interest Received
0.01828253 / 0.18470671 = 9.8% Gain (over 17 days, that's good or 210% annually)
0.18470671 / 0.36419925 = 50.7% = Total Received % of Total Loaned so I still have some time before I really know how I'm doing. When Total Received is greater than Initial Deposit is a milestone I'm looking for. 
Interest Received / Initial Deposit
0.01828253 / 0.24276087  = 7.5% interest
Overdue: 0.0125
Overdue / Initial Deposit
0.0125 / 0.24276087 = 5.1% overdue
Net Profit
0.01828253 - 0.0125 = 0.00578253 = $2.86  @ $495/btc
0.00578253 / 0.24276087 = 2.4% net profit in 17 days. 
2.4% * 365 / 17 = 51.52% Annual Percentage Yield but the interest compounds quite frequently because I am always re-investing in new listings. But since Bitcoin is down about 20% over the week, my investment is worth considerably less USD than it was earlier. If I can keep investing in good borrowers, I will still be doing better than my IRA and 401(k) if Bitcoin price increases and I have faith that Bitcoin will hit $1200 again some day.

As a matter of concept, Ownership vs Control with Bitcoin is a very different set of ideas than with other property. It's the difference between 'can' and 'may' -- can refers to ability and may refers to permission. 
I own a grill because people believe it is somebody's and not theirs. It sits on the patio of my house and no one has decided to go off with it. People know it is my house because, if I follow rules, pay my taxes, the State will register the house to me and use the force of violence to enforce the deed of the house as mine. Except in some extreme cases of squatting... Ownership is enforced by the State. It is a permission. You may own things. With Eminent Domain, the State can and may remove your property. The State's duty to make it so only they can or may remove your property. When other people can and do, the State uses violence to enforce that they may not. 
Bitcoin is different. With Bitcoin, you may own them but you also can control them. Control is a power beyond ownership. It is not a permission; it is an ability. With Bitcoin, using techniques like bip38 passphrases and brainwallets, the knowledge of a private key can be exclusively withheld by an individual. Unless some asshole perfects mind reading technology and uses it violently to extract private knowledge, Bitcoin is controllable. Can you see how that is better than ownership? No one can steal your Bitcoin if you are wise!

Cloud mining may or may not be a scam or a ponzi scheme. There are areas of incompleteness with your logic. There are signs of truth when a cloud mining company cares about its image and devotes resources towards showing media of their operation but there are many new businesses in cloud mining which do not have the capacity to do this. Many are scams. Some are not. I do advise caution as it is a sort of 'Survival of the Fittest' arms race with bitcoin mining. There are just many risks with mining yourself though.
Let's say I want to participate in Bitcoin mining because I have excess fiat and I think Bitcoin will go to the moon some day so I will HODL my Bitcoin until that happens. I do not want to be arsed with setting it up, paying electricity, or operations, so I will pay a cut of the reward for someone to do this. Cloud mining may make sense but I must really investigate and trust the miner. 
Your calculations do not account for price variance with Bitcoin or adjustments to overall network hashrate. You say they ask for $10. They might ask for dollars. They might ask for Bitcoin. To calculate a prediction of profit is a quite complex formula. You have to know the exchange rate of btc at purchase. The rate of network growth. The reward algorithm of the mining pool your cloud provider is in. The fees of the cloud provider. The depreciation of your ghs. The future value of Bitcoin. Look at the different reward types. Some favor users with larger hashrates. Not everyone has large hashrates so some people just throwing in a hundred bucks end up losers.  
You say: They don't contribute to the mining pool distribution.
My response: The mining pool distribution isn't as bad as it was a few months ago. Giving CEX/Ghash too much mining power was a bad thing. It is good to diversify and decentralize. I am OK when a cloud miner uses any mining pool except the largest one.
Overall, I'd say to be super careful with mining in general unless you're a math or accounting genius. 
You might get burned with cloud mining... But you might make it rich some day. It's easier just to buy bitcoin and save a lot/spend a little.

A new hot area of research is cryptographically proving the solvency of bitcoin deposits at various bitcoin institutions: exchanges, p2p lenders, and more. It is interesting how some organizations are quick to offer their proof of reserves, but how do you prove that depositors have the first right to those reserves? What about other liabilities. One example: If a deposit holder owes the energy company a boatload of money, can the state enforce liquidity of the depositors assets to pay the energy company?

I am sorry you were downvoted by others. I gave you an upvote because I read Nakomoto's white paper and I think I understand most of it. I think what you said is a less descriptive analogy for the progenerative or insidious property of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is preogenerative (possibly insidious, depending on perspective) for reasons. It adds value because it is an agnostic public service which effectively secures a value and transmits it reliably all over the world almost instantaneously and trustlessly. It gives one with the exclusive knowledge of a private key the ability to control a ledger balance. Whereas states exist to monopolize power, they may be powerless to obtain control of a private key--unless some asshole perfects mind reading. 
Because the technology adds value to money, its demand will increase. Also, the supply is programmed to decrease. Because the supply is programmed to decrease and demand will increase, the price will go up. Because the price will go up, early adopters are rewarded. Because early adopters are rewarded, the demand will increase.

Remember, you're protecting just a key. A string of characters which unlocks the bitcoin for spending. If you're protecting a vast sum, put a lot of locks on it. Dispurse funds into more than one multi-sig offline wallet with 2/3 keys required. Keep one easily accessible on a cold storage device like a plastic card you keep in your pocket. Keep one at home in your safe. Keep one with your relatives. 
Worst case, your trusted relative burglarizes you and acquires the second key or you are compelled to surrender your wallet key to the one who has emptied your safe.


Diversify. Don't keep them all in one public address. 


Fire: Hopefully your wallet is in your pants that you are wearing or your safe is fire resistant so that one of your two keys are not destroyed. If one is, get the key from the relative. 
EMP: Cold storage keys. 


Hmmm. Okay.

We live in a super fascinating new era where ubiquity of Internet access is gaining momentum and considered a human right by many nations of the world. I suggest you read the Satoshi White Paper. 
Bitcoin was the first of its kind, it has momentum to gain traction on the uphill battle of the technology adoption curve. Other coins probably aren't going to gain on the market cap of Bitcoin because they don't have the same large talent pool, no unique value-added features, etc. Besides, Bitcoin is adaptable. Policy can be modified. Features can be added. Bitcoin is open source and influenced by the majority but ultimately controlled by a trusted, voluntary, suitable benevolent dictator much like Linux is controlled by Linus Torvalds. 
Bitcoin was the first digital currency to solve the legendary problem of electronic money. It indiscriminately provides a secure, decentralized electronic ledger as a public good. A ledger as means to plan resource utilization is the value of that money really is.  The legendary problem of electronic money is that computers are very good at making copies of things. So, Bitcoin exploits this by putting copies of the ledger everywhere using a distributed hash table--the Bitcoin Blockchain.  Because it is everywhere on the millions, billions(?) of computer systems of worldwide volunteers, it can not be destroyed.
 Bitcoin uses breakthrough mathematics (a fraction of one human lifetime old) called elliptical curve encryption to solve the problem of trust. The problem with trusting a central authority leads to abuse, exploitation and anger. Large systems like government and corporations are self-evidently highly susceptible to corruption. No human or computer can break the encryption of Bitcoin. You would need a computer the size of the universe to get a fraction of the way through the keyspace until max entropy is reached--so very likely impossible to crack. The one controlling the private key of a Bitcoin public address is the one who controls spending (subtracting) from the ledger balance. When you own Bitcoin, you really own the private key--power to spend the Bitcoin value on the ledger for that public address  (account).
Bitcoin has a built in monetary policy to limit the supply. The amount of Bitcoin which can be mined is predictable and awarded by luck. The reward amount decreases every set number of blocks (about every 4 years) until every Bitcoin possible is mined in 2140.  Deflation is a reward to give incentive for adoption. 
Bitcoin has enormous value added service as a system of programmable money. Tip bots, micropayments, peer to peer finance, international remission, and the upcoming fad: business to business remission. Bitcoin adds value of removing corruption because the ledger is publicly available for reading. Money on the Bitcoin ledger can be traced, tracked, followed, audited, and accounted for. Bitcoin has potential to end war, poverty, and economic dishonesty.


Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous. If you can remove your personal identity from being tied to a public address, you are anonymous. That's easier said than done considering how much info you have to give to trade fiat for BTC most efficiently.

Here's my go at prediction. Ubiquity will take 15 more years. A country could adopt bitcoin as it's national currency now, however, I don't think they will be wise to do that until price has stabilized. A bitcoin "bank run" (or runaway bot war on an exchange) could drive the price down and leave the country vulnerable to price instability. 
Bitcoin adption would be very good for the country when prices are stable. I think as Bitcoin and related works improve, assets will be tied to the blockchain and prices will stabilize. I think Bitcoin is more the currency of institution and professionals and this will drive stabilization. Also, I think one day the market effects will probably reverse. Prices in Bitcoin will be stable and state currencies will fluctuate. 
I think that bitcoin is more likely to become widespread and not entirely replace cash but cash may become bitnotes with public addresses with private keypairs held privately by the government. 
In order to sustain Bitcoin, the country will need just a broadband cell phone infrastructure and adequate power. A country would be well positioned to host its percentage of global population as percentage of network hash power.
Bitcoin is likely to become the 'gold' of crypto with competing altcoins as the 'silver' 'copper' 'bronze' and 'tin' alternates.

False. You can have a Bitcoin private key which controls funds in an address but have no funds in it, and have no bought no bitcoin. When you buy bitcoin, you do not gain any future control to the seller's private key. 
When you buy Bitcoin, you are asking someone to unlock their ledger balance and transmit a transaction to the distributed ledger. When you sell bitcoin, you are unlocking your balance and broadcasting a write to someones ledger. In essence, the digits are what changes hand. 
The ledger is everyone's. The ability to say your balance can be changed is up to you and how good you are at controlling access to your private key.

Using the [Bitcoin Address Utility]( generate a BIP38 intermediate code from a passphrase. Next, order a plastic BIP38 passphrase protected bitcard from  paying with bitcoin. Once you have received your card, send bitcoin to the address of the card.
The card is just a plastic wallet card which has a public key and your BIP38 passphrase encrypted private key (which no one but you can decode).

Your bitcoins are in the blockchain distributed to machines of all types. The private key controls the spending of bitcoins. So let's focus on how to protect a Bitcoin Private Key. 
Would your statement be that you would never store your private key on a windows machine? Would you store your private key in a web wallet? If so, are you picky about what machine you log into your web wallet with? Would you store your private key on a Linux machine? Would you store it on a hardware wallet? Wow. I want to design a super secure multisig hardware wallet. 
I have a plastic wallet--a bit-card from  and it has my public key and it has my private key, bip38 passphrase protected, printed on the card behind a security seal. I provided intermediary code for the passphrase so the vendor never had possession of my private key or passphrase. 
I usually buy bitcoin in weekly drafts of $100 using Coinbase and my bank account. I transfer them to a new hot wallet each time. I have keys everywhere: on paper, in mobile phone app wallets, in mobile web wallets, on PC wallets. I have my bitcoin wealth distributed among several hot wallets with just under $100 balances for spending bitcoin in different places. For example, I wouldn't want to use my gambling wallet with Coinbase =] The motherload of my bitcoin holdings are controlled with the private key on the BIP-38 bit card. I have been planing to revise this strategy to use multisig so in the event I die my bitcoin can be inherited.

Money has several values including a value as a means to measure and set limits on resource consumption. We humans have an insatiable unlimited desire for goods and we have finite, limited resources available. Bitcoin is money because it facilitates the ledger in a highly practical way.  We want and need programmable money. It is the digital currence of choice because it was the first reliable digital currency and has intertia with a large number of users. An altcoin may usurp Bitcoin far ahead into the future but as long as Bitcoin adheres to our values we will all come to concensus about the price. There's 21 million bitcoins to come into existence through 2140. Over half have been mined. Many are lost forever. There's 7 billion people in the world today. Those bits are going to become very expensive one day.

You have to pay a credit bureau to get the scores and you have to verify identity. Have you ever taken a loan? Also, about time: Distribution of the funds isn't the hard part. It's getting the borrower figured out. 


For the app you really would just be requesting that the company send a payment in bitcoin somewhere, and then settling up with the company later.


How does what you are suggesting eliminate scariness? 


BTCJam can link loans to price of USD so if BTC price skyrockets borrower doesn't have to pay back a huge sum.

But people say the blockchain is getting prohibitively large and opponents say storage device size is always doubling quickly. Could it be expected that Bitcoin will be minimized by a blockchain of superior design for nitch applications? Would these fit the definition of a side chain?

Pros: Coinbase is safe. It's insured. They appear to be pretty innovative and competent with their security practices. I like their vault. I like their access with SMS. It was easy to setup. I could do it all online with ease. 
Cons: I don't like how it takes a week to convert my fiat into BTC. I don't have any revolving lines of credit or credit card. Coinbase will adhere to know your customer (KYC) laws and your bitcoin transactions are easily tracked to you. So don't do anything illegal or you might find yourself on the wrong end of a business stick. The 1% transaction fee is off-putting. 
Other Notes: Some Skyhook Bitcoin "ATM" (vending machine) are independently operated and configured with no fees so you can pay anonymously for bitcoins with cash if you can find one of these. I'm ignorant in this area, but I know some high tech vending machines want your biometrics and are privacy intrusive. 
Also, I hear a lot of people having trouble with Coinbase. When there is a conflict between the bank and Coinbase for a high transaction volume or anything like that, they will termnate your account and you bank might do the same. A lot of people who resell Bitcoin for profit on LocalBitcoins (LBC) will run into this problem. If you do high transaction volume, like, &gt;3K a month USD, then they consider you high risk. Unless you've registered a business account with your bank and Coinbase and have been appropriately screened.

I am sorry to make fun of you sarcastically. You reminded me a recent story. My buddy called me one Sunday morning, real early... Probably 5 AM. 
My buddy said: "I need a ride. I was at the bars downtown. I went into a bar, realized I didn't have my wallet. It was in my truck. I went outside to get it out of the truck and the truck was gone! I just got done filing a police report."
I said: "Did you leave the keys in the truck?"
He said: "Yes."
I said: "I'll come get your dumb ass. Tell me your location."
Keeping your bitcoin private keys on a computer with Internet remote access software (especially TeamViewer) is about the same thing as going to a downtown bar and leaving the keys in your unlocked truck. It may not be a common sense... But it's the sense I get as a person with a decade of experience in IT application development.

Legally speaking, yes, you can own bitcoin in most places of the world.
Bitcoin is a permissionless system. Let's dive into the details of ownership in this permission-less system:
Bitcoin is a giant record book (the Blockchain) secured by cryptographic means by millions of miners, nodes, and clients (The Bitcoin Network) recording how many units of something you have (almost exclusively Bitcoin currency, but can be other assets).  
You don't own bitcoins. Bitcoins are an intangible value in the ledger, a distributed database file on a bittorrent-like network. 
You own knowledge of a private key. The private key is what allows you sign a transaction, making it valid and included in the Bitcoin distributed ledger.  
Exclusive knowledge of a private key is ownership. If only you have the key, you own the bitcoin in that address.
Logically speaking, if you can maintain exclusive knowledge of a private key compatible with the Bitcoin network then you can own bitcoin. So anyone can own Bitcoin, even non-human entities like AI bots and IoT devices can own bitcoin... but usually they're setup to benefit their owner through key sharing.

Having done no prior research on a safe, it was difficult to find a safe meeting your suggested requirements. You may consider using passphrase encryption on your physical private keys like [BIP38]( and engrave it into stainless steel if you are looking for longevity. An attacker would need to possess the passphrase and encrypted private key presumably stored only on your metal wallet. You may also consider using multi-signature addresses to mitigate fire loss. With BIP38 + MultiSig + Physical Storage protecting your key, it is highly unlikely you would lose exclusive knowledge of the private key.

I have a little bit of experience writing web apps in python which connect to the Coinbase and GDAX APIs.
Speaking to the technical capabilities of the software... in consideration of your post... I think I could write a software that you could provide API keys to... It detects when you have sold bitcoin on Coinbase, waits for it to go 1% lower, buys back the amount of Bitcoin you have sold, and transfers it to a cold storage address, and sends you a nastogram for being bearish and reminds ya to HODL. 
Of course, considering "what would it take to...?" this would take me about 100 hours and I'd want about $15k for writing it.  
@_date: 2016-06-26 04:55:52
I created an experimental, automated trade bot that connects to GDAX and trades profitably. I've made over 2000 trades with the bot in the first two weeks. The return on investment has been very promising. I have diagramed future versions that connect to other exchanges as well. Planned features include multi asset support and cross-exchange arbitrage.  I'd like to eventually get into Counterparty assets too. I am sure each of the markets I plan to include soon can handle 500 BTC a day (probably much more). 
I have champagne tastes on a soda-pop budget, and so when I recently needed travel money, I withdrew funds from my experiment's account in order to go to my family reunion. I discontinued this version of the bot because a) no money and b) I can make it 20% more profitable with about 20 lines of code, if I perform a test to verify my order is not going to be a "taker" but instead a "maker" on the exchange, making it fee-free. I just don't have a lot of time. I work full time (Software Dev) plus I school full time (Software Dev).

Blockchain/Bitcoin in particular does not lead us to Communism because it leads us to anarcho-capitalism. 
Anarcho-capitalism is a political philosophy that advocates the elimination of the state in favor of individual sovereignty, private property, and open markets.

Hello Greetings, friend. Congratulations on joining Bitcoin. Your curiosity had led you to discovering one of the most revered inventions which our future kind will judge in history to have great impact in the Age of Information. For since the time before history, human beings have been tribal and adversarial but lesser and lesser with communication, understanding, and agreement and this capacity-to-cooperate grows. Still, countless cliques exist within our globally-connected 21st century civilization and now you are among the wisest and most venerable humans to choose Bitcoin. As you will discover through one of the grand masters of Bitcoin, Andreas Antonopoulos by reading his published works, including the book Mastering Bitcoin and The Internet of Money, and including [his YouTube Channel]( you will understand Bitcoin is many things. Bitcoin is a network of consensus. Bitcoin is a hyperspace ledger. Bitcoin is a currency. Bitcoin is permissionless. The labels we use require so much context and nuance because Bitcoin is a very complex protocol. As you grow with us and get wiser, you will see a larger picture of the impact of Bitcoin's maturation and I hope you will participate by learning how to apply your skills in the area of Bitcoin development. Bitcoin is becoming a universally accessible utility for entities, especially humans like us, to authenticate and transact with information in an immutable public record. To the unattuned, the future of money will be background noise. Like Linux, an average person just wont even realize Bitcoin is there and they're using it. Credit, Insurance, Investments, and many other financial instruments will be commodity smart contracts that are instantaneously accessible to anyone. The system facilitates greater trust and security for all. And that's why people realize Bitcoin is a pretty big deal. I urge you to keep purchasing bitcoin in small amounts consistently over time. I urge you to understand how to secure your coin and advocate security to others. And finally, good luck!

I've been scammed by cloud mining at least five times in the past 2.5 years. The first took my money in bitcoin and gave me nothing. The second took $34 and in 2 years returned about $4. The third was Cex.io ghs... probably lost $200 in that. The next one took my money via paypal and gave me nothing so I disputed and won. The most recent is genesis mining. Got about 20% back, future looking bad for it based on diminishing return. Cloud mining is just a legal way of subsidizing miners with negative interest loans. Don't do it.

You could deposit unlimited BTC or USD via bank wire to GDAX and trade unlimited USD/BTC on the exchange there, but they have a withdrawal limit of $10k a day for USD.

If you live in the US and would go to Walmart and get a reloadable debit card for about $2-3 and preload it with at least $10 or $20 (Depending on which card, that's the minimum load), and register it online, you can definitely use it just like a debit/checking account without the checks and even get your pay direct deposited to it. I gave one away at Christmas 4 years ago and my relative was still using it and had to renew hers. What you need to know is there's two kinds of prepaid debit. There's the prepaid, non-reloadable kind which are anonymous and have limited features. On this card you might not receive full service online account with a ledger but you should at a minimum get some automated phone system features including a balance check. And then there's the pre-paid reloadable kind which have to be registered due to KYC regulations. Have you looked at the payment options available at localbitcoins.com? There's a lot of options!

They do provide convenience if you wish to convert a store of Bitcoin to spendable fiat within a relative quick time however I'm fine to wait the 2 days for an ACH conversion for less cost.

It depends on how much thought you put into it. I seriously believe in mathematical models which predict Bitcoin being worth hundreds of thousands per coin inside of a decade. That $50k could be $1m.

I make my case that the Shift is expensive for the following reasons:
* I've never paid for a bank-issued debit card, bit it doesn't have a bitcoin feature, plus
* Walmart's debit card is less than half the cost, but doesn't include a bitcoin feature, plus
* They're charging $10--in Bitcoin--for the card, plus
* If I compare the fee schedule of the Shift Card, available in the cardholder agreement, everything is more expensive than any other debit card I've compared it to. International Tx? Most places ~2%. Shift? 3%. Plus, 
* The conversion rate is a fee-cloaking mechanism. The conversion rate is set by them/coinbase (it doesn't mention how this rate is calculated in the cardholder agreement or anywhere on their site, I went through them with a fine toothed comb to look for it. I think they're using Coinbase's spot rate, which is below-market-value.)

On every BTCJam related thread on I read a lot of people saying: "I lost a lot of my bitcoins to scammers!" but here's a screensnip of my 401(k) vs BTCJam investments statistics.
I started using BTCJam in July 2014 and stopped investing in new listings in September 2014. Around February 2015 I started investing again and I have some Autoinvest profiles setup on my account.... I am thinking about just investing the employer matched amount and instead of increasing my contribution rate in 401(k) diverting those resources to BTCJam.
So employer match aside, for excess savings I think BTCJam is looking like a much more attractive investment vehicle than my 401(k). What do you think?
Edit: Auto-Invest is setup with two profiles: A&amp;B borrowers in CoindeskUSD for all terms. A,B&amp;C borrowers in Bitcoin for all terms. So these: 
I also setup a A&amp;B profile for all currencies with terms 60 days and under. This is to not really mimic the highly profitable "payday loan" model but with the most conservative credit risk profiles. Just the idea is that interest will compound quicker in this autoinvest profile.  
Edit: Another thought, the reason my CoindeskUSD rate is low is because when I was new I invested 0.2 btc (10x my usual) into a BitstampUSD (before they switched to Coindesk) pegged loan that went bad. So it may take about 1000 loans for that to reach equilibrium with the expected yield.

Yes, the performance of personal credit ratings is a component of competitive advantage of one lender over another. 


Not up front, bit in the case of a default they turn over identity information in the NetArb award letter, which can be used to verify the identity and pursue the debtor to the fullest extent of the law. I invest 0.02 btc (minimum to rate borrower, about $5-6) per loan and its not worth going to court over. I have petitioned BTCJam to include a country filter in Auto-Invest so lenders can only invest where they have the power of law to collect on defaults.

A bitcoin miner is basically a shitty computer (something like a raspberry pi) with a really expensive ASIC attached to it. The shitty computer loads an OS, network, and bitcoin software. The ASIC does the bulk of the computational work for Bitcoin. As pointed out, there's some rules to it. Based on the available network hash rate, Bitcoin sets a network difficulty, and they're basically setting the number of zeros required in a correct answer to the puzzle that challenges miners.... The puzzle is "What's the hash of the next block?" and the miners have to recombine and hash tx out of the memory pool until they are able to product a block with a hash with the right number of zeros. More hash power availability requires more difficulty so more zeros are required to increase the rareness of possible accepted answers and increase the average time between blocks. Bitcoin tries to keep the average at 10 minutes with its floating difficulty.

"how would he submit the hash to the chain" a transaction can be transmitted via any medium as long as it reaches a node in the Bitcoin network. If the input can be delivered to a node, that node can propagate it. A node can be programmed to accept transaction input in many ways but in this case passed from person-to-person until someone were to type it into a computer. Even now, work is being done to make Bitcoin a universal service accessible with radio waves. A passive listener could use an emerging protocol to recognize a shortwave signal from very far away and deliver it to the Bitcoin network.

I think it's best to invest each pay period. After 20 years of doing that, assuming the price is equal in value, while Bitcoin follows the trend of rising value, you'll have at least $52,000 worth of bitcoin but probably a lot more. Perhaps enough to retire on. If not here, maybe the philippines.

They do in some countries, but not in the USA. Unacceptable, multi-faceted risk. The gift cards do not have a fixed exchange rate between USD and Bitcoin so it is high risk for a retailer to buy preloaded cards. If they buy one hundred one-bitcoin gift cards for $28,000 but the next day they are worth $25,000 so the store must be very careful about pricing... They don't want to discount them at loss and customers don't want to overpay. This is a side effect of the value of bitcoin being inconsistent over time because of its relatively small market cap. Also, if the cards are pre-funded, there is risk of irreversible theft of the cards and their high value. So you could integrate an on-line activation service like most gift cards have these days so they're not loaded until time of purchase. You are generally subject to FINCEN rules and KYC/AML regulation for exchanging fiat to Bitcoin, so there is regulatory risk. The government wants to tie identities to transactions as much as possible to heuristically detect illegal activity and stop it. Last thing you want is Mr. McSilkRoad stopping in twice a week for Bitcoins then having a shootout with agents in your store. Just thinking of the worst case scenario here.

With Bitcoin now we just update ownership of bitcoin tokens in a database file--stored on a bittorrent swarm--using public key cryptography for authentication.

2. I can give you an example of when I wanted to use it. I wanted to log into CEX.IO and my account requires 2fa. I did not back up my authenticator seed so I contacted support to find options for resetting it. One option was to sign a message from my wallet but my blockchain.info web wallet didn't have the feature (or does it??) so I had to take a photo of myself patting my head and rubbing my belly while standing on one leg hopping and yodeling for the CEX administrators to get the 2fa reset. 
3. I have not thought this through.
4. I found them interesting but I grew concerned when Overstock was making its moves. I recall there is regulatory risk on the Counterparty platform so they Overstock had to build a new platform that is regulatory-compliant. I think the concept of digital stock is amazing and would love to see the future of that.

Does that make you uncomfortable? Its not right to shame the drug users or even lump drug users together with generalizations. People would buy illegal drugs on the Internet [since 1972. When it was just ARPANET]( No surprise, in this present-day plutocratic dystopia, drug laws are keeping the police and prisons profitable and legal leverage to prune the streets of dislikable people. In 2013, it was estimated 19.8 million Americans had past-month marijuana use. So just under 10% of Americans are "current users" illegally smoking pot. The past several presidents did it. The next equality movement may logically be for the people who prefer a safer alternative for recreational enjoyment. Bitcoin may make look appealing to people wanting to make illegal purchases but its really not a good solution for disconnecting identity from a transaction. There are altcoins for that. P.S. Dont do drugs. Drugs are unpopular and still politically safe to hate. Side effects may include beatings and incarceration.

If I understand correctly: You want to store data on the Bitcoin blockchain? The blockchain is like a really highly-redundant database. It's not made for storage, it's made for immutability. The blockchain is slow and expensive.

Ethereum, on the other hand, might be better than Bitcoin for that but still not the right solution.

I can count a few reasons, because: 
* a US Debit card transaction is reversible (I.E. Chargeback, Fraud Report) and the cardholder has certain indemnifications the bank is accountable to... and a bitcoin transaction is not reversible. So a person can buy 1 BTC and screw the merchant. Not many merchants can survive this risk. Plus fraudsters love to target bitcoin and money exchanges to obfusticate and launder money sources. 
* Because in the USA, Bitcoin exchanges are subject to anti-money-laundering (AML) and know-your-customer regulations, requiring a money transmitter license from FINCEN, which adds legal red tape to those wishing to offer the service of selling Bitcoin for Debit.
I've been a completely-satisfied Coinbase customer for a few years now and I've never had a problem with them, HOWEVER, the horror stories I've seen tend to be with people  somehow triggering them to find the customer too risky for Coinbase's risk-appetite. For example, things known to trigger their wrath are unusually high transaction volume or the appearance of doing business-transactions on a personal account... (so lying on your application, essentially). Or suspected illegal activity (like gambling from your exchange wallet). General ToS violation kind of stuff.

Hello 16, I'm rastanikoten (ha). 
Congratulations friend, I can tell already you are a very thoughtful person for having dedicated a portion of your income to Bitcoin. I think you have done well to put passion and reason together to make this decision. I fully agree with your conclusion to buy based on the research available. 
If you really believe Bitcoin is going to be mainstream, I think you might be not-totally-correct. At least at a consumer level. My mom isn't going to switch to Bitcoin (as we know it) today. It's just too complicated for an average person. The concepts of using encryption as a means to digital signing is too hard. When I was 16, I thought Linux was going to be mainstream. Of course, Linux is very successful today running the entire backends of things. And it's the most popular kernel--powering billions of devices running the Android operating system. Bitcoin will only get to be more mainstream as layers are built on top of it. The future people using bitcoin won't even realize that's what they're using! Money in the future will be a highly automated flowing thing. You would do well to study Lightning Networks. Can you imagine what it is like to have streaming money?
I am going to offer you the best advice now: S/He who saves money is better prepared to survive hard times. So if you want to be a survivor, you want to be a saver. You're doing good if you will hold onto that.

They need more than only your credit card. Bitcoin Exchanges are regulated as money service businesses and are required to know their customer, which means they have to do some basic identity validation. So the thief would need to steal your identity. This could be your exchange password at Coinbase or some other exchange. Always use two factor authentication on your financial accounts if its offered! But yeah, if someone does an instant buy of Bitcoin and sends it somewhere... it's up to you to seek indemnity from the bank by reporting the transaction as fraud and that person is $500 richer. It'd be hard to find the fraudster but not impossible.

Imagine a view of the Bitcoin Blockchain as a checkbook ledger. Let's say we have a million computers with a copy of the ledger and they run a little program with a ruleset to determine if the ledger is good or not. Now let's say a group of bitcoin miners change the rules a little by running a different version of the validator program. Suddenly stuff that wasn't valid before is valid now. Now when miners stop agreeing on what's valid, they might stop talking to each other. Different rules have different policies for what to do if they aren't met, but usually it's to stop talking to the guy who passed you the copy of the ledger that didn't validate. So then we have two groups of software clients who had the same ledger but after a software update the ledgers stopped validating and the groups became isolated. But the same owners of the same funds on each ledger can still spend funds on both chains with the same keysets. The difference is both pools have a different opinion on what is a valid copy of the ledger and copies grow divergent after the fork.

Imagine a view of the bitcoin ledger as a flat file...  with public keys and balances. When the fork happens, that flat file is split into two identical copies. The same public keys own the same balances on both copies but with one copy we're going to apply the rules of Bitcoin2x and on the other we're going to run the rules of Bitcoin. So now we have two ledgers. The same private keys which worked before will now still work on each the same way. But the balances will begin to unbalance between the two ledgers because the rulesets are different. Which rulebook people value more will be determined and one currency will get sold into oblivion.

So Bitcoin is a new form of money invented by a person or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto. Nobody knows who they really are, but they gave the world something new and exciting. Bitcoin is new and hard for many people to understand because the word is used in many strange ways. Bitcoin excites people for many reasons and some consider the excitement disruptive. One reason is because it is permissionless, meaning anyone can use it without anyone else's permission as long as they have a computer or phone to send a message. If you have a phone and can commit twelve words to memory, you can have a Bitcoin account. It's amazing.  So both bad guys and good guys can use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is neat is because it's like a credit card account anyone can have--even kids and robots! But with the kind of money our country uses now, fiat money, the government can say who can and can't use money. Some people like that but many people want freedom. Another feature is the security of Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, people don't have to trust banks, because sometimes banks rob people like they did the people of Greece in 2015--at the instruction of the government. Really history shows you can't trust anybody with your money but with Bitcoin you only have to trust in yourself! The smallest piece of a bitcoin is called a satoshi named after the creators Satoshi Nakamoto. There are only ever going to be two hundred ten trillion satoshis. That's 21 with fourteen zeros behind it. A hundred million satoshis is called a Bitcoin. One satoshi is worth more than a venezuelan dollar, a money used by 33 million people in Venezuela, in South America, not very far from the USA! That's a lot of people. Bitcoin is attractive for many reasons but mostly because it is safer than any other money so many people want to trade their fiat money for Bitcoin. So Bitcoin has a high price and that makes people very excited too. I think it is important for you to practice using Bitcoin some day. Download a Bitcoin Wallet today and ask your parents to pay your allowance in Bitcoin!

"Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme." Yeah it kind of is. There will be Two Hundred Ten Trillion Satoshis Only. About 85% of them are mined already. Countless of them are lost or burned. 15% Satoshis are remaining to be created, but it will be a very long time to get them all. 100 billion market cap now with a bright future with some potential for trillions in market cap. I do not believe Bitcoin will have a market cap less than 100 billion in any year after 2020.

I would say: If you don't own the keys, you don't own the bitcoin. What do you want to do with the bitcoin? Spend it or hold it? Seriously, Coinbase is a great place to keep your coins if you're going to spend them or sell them soon and if it's a small amount, like up to about a paycheck's worth of money. For other use cases or if you're a holder, my advice is to use a computer with optical media drive, disconnect it from any wired network, and use a Ubuntu LiveCD with the wallet generator pre-installed, generate some private keys, encrypt them with a passphrase, then print them and do not save them to any media. Yah, it's a lot of work but then you are certain only you have a copy. It's an affordable secure key storage method.

The wallet is not on the CD. Bitcoin us confusing because it uses words like wallet. To spend bitcoin what do you need? The Private Key! What do you need if you want to send bitcoin to an address? The Public Key! The public key is a derivative from the private key.  The public key is the bitcoin address. The private key signs a transaction. You're putting the private key on paper so no one can steal it from your computer and spend your bitcoin.
 &gt;Also when you say disconnecting it from a wired network is wireless also included?
When you run the Ubuntu Live CD you do not want to change the known-good-secure operating system so you don't want to connect to a wifi network which will be by default disassociated from any networks. But if there's a wired network, it will connect and then it's no longer a secure instance of an operating system.

A few days ago? I am guessing a couple days ago, on the 24th. Coinbase is slow at moving money with ACH transfers. It takes about -exactly 1 week.

Let's talk about Shor's Algorithm. Shor's Algorithm is just a way to factor numbers. The implied risk is that someone will discover a way to render the cryptography behind Bitcoin useless to secure value.  An attacker would need a lot more than just Shor's Algorithm to do that so don't call the risk Shor's Algorithm. Shor's Algorithm is never going to do anything harmful to Bitcoin. We'll call it Cryptographic Risk. If someone did find a major vulnerability in Bitcoin's cryptography then the consensus of the network would be to hard fork and switch to a secure cryptography scheme. It's a way-out-of-this-world-never-going-to-happen-in-a-billion-years risk for which there would be a patch faster than you can say Shor's Algorithm. If you're thinking quantum computers might make all cryptography useless, think again. That's just a headline to grab your attention, not fact.

Let's chat for a minute about P2P Loans. I've seen mixed results. I got into the scene when BTCJam opened four years ago. Most people here on reddit hated BTCJam because they personally lost money. When it comes to lending, you have to spread your risk and expect defaults. I had over 100 loans invested with auto-invest and my NAR was over 10% on those loans. BTCJam was confronted by the SEC about selling securities and they abandoned business in the USA -- then went out of business not too long after that. It's a shame because my auto invest portfolio was starting to really kick ass. I tell you what is like BTCJam: LendingClub.com but they use real dollars and the market is way bigger. I still use lending club and I absolutely love it. After BTCJam stopped doing business in the USA, I found BitBond. I've not used it but I've been a member for a while and I login frequently to check out the listings. BitBond has very few listings and they're all rated with low credit scores. BTCJam had way more listings.  Let me put volume into perspective: BitBond has about 20 listings, BTCJam had about 120 (zero now obviously), and Lending Club has about 250-700 open listings on any given day. Overall, I rate BitBond as "Not a Scam" but I would also caution you as an investor with "Sub Prime Market Beware." If I was rich(er) I would setup auto-invest with BitBond: "You need to have at least 1.0 BTC in your AutoInvest account so that AutoInvest places bids"

If Bitcoin to Dollars is prohibited, Bitcoin to Pesos may still be permitted. If Coinbase shuts down, I can just switch jurisdictions virtually over the internet. I can go to Coins.ph. I'll get my Bitcoin as Pesos. And Pesos to Dollars may still be permitted because why ban that? So there's just an extra intermediate step to convert. Yeah, annoying, but not the same as trying to spend pesos in a country that accepts dollars. 
You just don't understand that banning Bitcoin is an impossibility. Bitcoin is popular in Western nations. Thousands and thousands of people unemployed as a result. Banning something is a way to make it more popular. Suddenly, a lot of money would exit the economy and go into bitcoin. It's political suicide to ban Bitcoin.

By January 2018, 80% of all Bitcoin will be mined as the number of bitcoin produced is cut in half about every four years. Bitcoin is a currency that will be even more valuable after the last bitcoin is mined. Why are antiques valuable? Because they don't make them anymore! It's just a balance of scarcity and demand. There are many deep facets of Bitcoin innovation that make it wanted if for nothing else than to hold onto a piece of history. Bitcoins are a capital with the innovative ability to make value into a content type--this means value can transferred as a message over any medium as long as it reaches the Bitcoin network. So instead of expensive secure networks that get hacked money can be sent via cheap broadcasts from secure endpoints. There will be working nodes after the last Bitcoin is mined. They might be in a museum, but our great grandchildren will witness it and a whole bitcoin would probably be priceless.

Bitcoin is a permissionless system. Bitcoin does not care if you are a drug lord, a hacking group, an exile, a software bot, or yourself. Most bitcoin users are good people. So by using Bitcoin, a user is helping him or herself most importantly but may also be helping others, some of which may be drug lords, hacking groups, exiles, or whatever. The question is: Do you want to participate in a fiat system or a permissionless system? I like the answer: "Both!" because I like to have options.

Virtually impossible. When a Bitcoin transaction is first sent into the mempool, it can be examined and predicted with 99% certainty whether it will be confirmed. If the heuristics say it will be confirmed, it can be accepted. But merchants can choose how much certainty they want by determining how many confirmations they will wait for. If they wait for one confirmation, the transaction is very likely immutable. Confirmations are every 10 minutes on average but can take up to two hours. The more valuable the good, the more confirmations you want to wait for. The more confirmations there are, the less likeliness there is for a double spend. If you're selling coffee zero confirmations might be fine. If you're selling a car or house you probably want at least 6 confirmations. A zero conf transaction with adequate fees is like 99% certain to be immutable. A 6 conf transaction is 99.9999% certainly immutable.

The dimension of time between two opposite exchanges is very important. The person hasn't really lost anything yet. The realization of value occurs at the second of the paired exchanges. Until the Bitcoin which was bought with USD is sold (exchanged), it is a stockpile with potential value. If I buy a share of Red Hat stock for $100 Monday, Tuesday its worth $80, Wednesday its  $100, Thursday its $90, Friday its $110, and the following Monday its exchanging for $100 again, I didn't realize any loss or gain of dollars. I only lost potential value on Tuesday and Thursday but I did not sell and did not lose. The investor might lose his wealth or might not. Bitcoin may exchange for a higher value than what he paid for it. It seems strongly probable that it will. The investor is only in trouble if he or she is somehow compelled to exchange the bitcoin for less but more-frugal programmers usually don't have too many issues with running out of liquidity.

I agree with your first and second sentences. You say: "You need to have your coins in your own wallet." Well, in the world of Bitcoin a wallet is a key manager and transaction signing utility. One just needs to understand Public Key Cryptography to understand Bitcoin security. A unit of bitcoin isn't really something which is stored any single place. It's not like a file where the bits are stored on your local medium such as a USB flash drive. The physical world binary digits representing bitcoin are stored in a public, encrypted, peer to peer cloud database replicated on millions of hosts across the world.
For understanding Bitcoin security: There's two keys needed: A public key ("Bitcoin Address" "Wallet Address") and a private key. The public key is where the money is sent, it's not a secret (you can share this information) but the private key signs a transaction to spend the bitcoin associated with the public key. The only way to control bitcoin is to maintain exclusive knowledge of the private key. Anyone with knowledge of the private key can spend the bitcoin. Bitcoin is secure because it's extremely mathematically improbable to guess a private key. The challenge lies in guarding the key. The only way to keep your bitcoin secure is to limit access to the private key and there are many strategies which with varying levels of security and convenience. 
You don't keep bitcoin in a wallet. You keep keys in a wallet. A key is information. It can be a file.  You can keep keys in other places too. Your head. A USB flash drive. The more secure you keep the key, the harder it is to retrieve it. The harder it is to retrieve the private key, the harder it is to sign a transaction. 
If you're investing in bitcoin, you might want to invest in a hardware wallet. Or at least keep the keys in offline storage.
Keys are interesting things. You can make a composite key that composed of two or more keys so a certain number are required to spend from that composite key's public key.

Furthermore, I'd be happy if it was accepted that government should not interfere with Bitcoin &amp; Crypto being used as a "tender type" (payment channels: cash, ebt, debit, credit, check) as we called it in the retail payment industry. If I go to the store, ring up $100 worth of groceries, and if that store wants to accept bitcoin at the market rate for USD/BTC then no government interference should be expected. The national currency should be the minimum expectation for a merchant's accepted "tender types" but it should not be a requirement for that to be the exclusively-accepted payment method. What's the harm in accepting Canadian Dollars, Philippine Pesos, or Bitcoin? They can all be traded at an online market rate.

audigex, thank you for your questions. First, have you heard of a Bitcoin speaker named Andreas Antonopoulos? He answers all of your questions much more eloquently than I am capable, but I will summarize some of his points.
First, the world is a very large place and we must be a lucky persons to live in a country where the need for Bitcoin is not so obvious. Some people are living in or have lived in a country with monetary policies which create economic collapse. Greece. Venezuela. There's so many I can't list and for brevity I won't. More than two dozen!
Andreas is from Greece. And like most people, he has parents... and they're getting older... But Greece did something. Their banks failed. They limited how much cash you could get from your accounts. If you had money in a greek bank, they took all of your money in excess of a certain amount. This meant retirement accounts. Their banks stole money from pensioners... and would-be targets of this theft included the parents of Andreas Antonopoulos. But he's smart and helped his mom use Bitcoin. 


It's a currency with superior attributes so it will win.
Bitcoin is predictable. Its policies are agreed on through a consensus network, the most advanced CN in the world. It is more stable than some fiat. 
Bitcoin is a Push rather than a Pull transaction, so it is more secure. No one's going to hack Target or Home Depot or any major retailer and get access to your Bitcoin account. 
Bitcoin makes money a content type. A bitcoin transaction is an unforgeable, signed, authenticated script to transfer wealth from one key to another so it can be transmitted over any medium. The medium does not need to be secured. Only the signing station.

Let people enter their own mutually beneficial agreements regarding Bitcoin. Currency regulation would be inappropriate because Bitcoin is a loosely defined label to many things. Do you mean Bitcoin the software ? Bitcoin the network protocol? Bitcoin the currency?  Bitcoin is both like and unlike a typical currency. Its currency 2.0. What about other crypto currencies in addition to Bitcoin? The answer is no because the government has no means to enforce any laws regarding Bitcoin &amp; cryptocurrency except through violence. Violence works on people, but not on information systems. It is futile to control information you do not own. How do you prove someone owns a bitcoin, especially if they don't want you to know it?

A bit expensive, but you can do a bank transfer at LocalBitcoins. Currently going for $2619.26 AUD = $1923.26 USD per BTC. A bit of a premium price eh?

Is it legal for me to buy gold coins and resell them at a higher price?

Maybe they laughed because they feel ignorant about how Bitcoin works and feel it would be an unacceptable mountain of work to pick up on the culture of bitcoin. I mean, how are you going to get them, with their current knowledge, to settle the matter of who operates the bitcoin transaction? I mean, I wouldn't expect my company to accept "Trust me with your private keys, Bitcoin is complicated, and only IT understands it. Only I can control the money" No. They would expect me to say "Oh a hacker ate your bitcoin." and show up to work in a Ferrari.

This may be a smart "Dead Man's Bet." He'll be dead before he has to pay this back, and the estate administrator may have a hard time seizing his assets to pay his debts... But his heirs may walk away with a bunch of bitcoin.

More on the problems with the two way Bitcoin ATMs:
They come at a high cost to the owner/operator. The machines are usually over 10k each just for the hardware and I think they require MSB licensing through FinCEN in the USA so to be a successful operator, you probably need a lot of them to break even on the cost of compliance alone.
There are some privacy concerns. Some people might be off-put by the KYC/AML regulatory compliance strategies implemented by the owner/operator.
The demand is pretty low for these machines and location is key. Until they are more ubiquitous, they wont get much exposure for new adopters, and until they're popular, they demand will not sustain movement toward ubiquity. Because they're expensive, have strict regulatory requirements, have a small inconvenience with privacy, and they're not very popular yet, the large spread between buy and sell price is necessary for the owner/operator and that feeds back into harming adoption.  Some people are just going to have to treat this as a long term investment and bet on mass adoption and operate the machines more-charitably until critical mass. 
If I were you I might tell the owner that the machine's spread is too much between buy and sell price. They might be willing to change it if they know it wins a customer.

Storj is neat in concept, but a common complaint from the community that it's not just ready despite the devs media presence. I understand that and see the poject with positive light. People are excited for it. Critics say "Show me the code." The developers seem to have a *good* philosophy of 'release early' but have an opportunity to live up to the other half of that motto: 'release often.' I know they have a git hub. I know the code is there, but it's all Python, JS, and Ruby and just not all that interesting yet. It has huge potential it hasn't lived up to yet. I would like to see it maturate. I would like to see the project written in something else, like C/C++. I welcome the project and hope it will attract more interest and more development. Some of the demos I have witnessed are *really freaking awesome* but I still can't consider it serious.

What is stopping malicious code from running is your trust in the publishers official release. You can download the source, audit it, compile it, and run it yourself if you wanted, or you could hire someone else to do that... Or you can trust that at some point someone audited the code (and they did) and it was good. 
Correct, you cannot mine while disconnected from the Internet.

First, the block reward halving has already happened. Second, this attitude that Bitcoin is "falling miserably" is so messed up. You don't understand. Bitcoin is a highly successful. To go from averaging nothing to averaging around $700 in a few years is great. While the price may fall from time to time, that's expected. That is how markets work. The important thing about value is the trend. And if you perform trend analysis on Bitcoin, it's phenomenal. There is little doubt in my mind that the future of money is entirely blockchain-based. I am so looking forward for a future where currency is not backed by violence but rather is backed by the Laws of Mathematics in Nature.

The one thing I don't like about Bitcoin is the lack of a chargeback feature. 
I think a good feature for the next crypto-currency is a passphrase to NUKE THE BITS if performed prior to 100-1000 confirmations. The idea is you can't take them back, but you can nuke them... as a F-U.

When we discuss reading about [The Philosophy of Liberty]( we can say that you own yourself and the products of your labor. Bitcoin is the best technology available to solve the problems of securing ownership of your property. You must understand what Bitcoin is. It's a it's a network and it is an indestructible public database with multiple applications including Bitcoin the currency. Other emerging applications include contracts and property ownership.
Bitcoin the currency uses the public database of Bitcoin as a universal public ledger. If you can find a bitcoin holder and you have Bitcoin software, you can trade assets like currency or labor or goods with a Bitcoin holder who will send a quantity of bitcoin from his account a value of Bitcoin the currency ranging from somewhere less than the maximum quantity of Bitcoin which will ever be produced, 21 million, down to one ten millionth, a very versatile range, to your Bitcoin address. 
A Bitcoin address is a public-key in crypto lingo. It is something you can share with others when you want them to pay you and it is used to examine the balance of that address in the ledger. Bitcoin offers the mechanism by which you can secure the transfer of wealth out of your ledger account with the knowledge of a private key. 
Knowledge of the private key is something that you can, at your choosing, retain or destroy even through the most heinous violence acted upon you. A private key is a piece of knowledge you generate that you should keep protected just like credit card numbers.  With the private keys, you will sign transactions and push the transaction to the Bitcoin network where volunteer miners, working for a chance to win newly created Bitcoin, provide confirmation and security for your transaction in the public ledger. 
Only a message signed with the private key for the sending address can be confirmed and entered into the ledger. By retaining exclusive knowledge of a private key only you can control the money. Ownership and Control are one in the same with the asymmetric encryption scheme found in Bitcoin. You collect private keys and store them in a wallet. You will probably own many private keys and should avoid reusing keys to promote pseudonymity in the ledger and to better protect your key from people working to crack the bitcoin network--which would be an INCREDIBLY difficult to achieve accomplishment... It's been going on for 7 years with no issues in the foundational software. 
This means to a libertarian that no one can tax you without consent. No one can rob you. No one can transfer ownership and control of the past product of your labors unless you agree to it. Your wealth is protected by the laws of mathematics enforced by nature and not by the laws of mankind enforced by violence.

I get randomly generous or altruistic at random times after seeing a bitcoin address and send out small pieces of digital money to strangers. Just a few cents worth of bitcoin here and there. Maybe somebody did that to you!
