It's not about if I can afford it. I can afford to do lots of things.. I can afford to pay all my suppliers 5% more if I wanted to, but it doesn't make business sense to. 
For example, could I attract more customers by spending £122.49 on a geographically targeted facebook ad campaign? There's tons of ways to attract customers that will likely see me get a better ROI than Bitcoin. I don't believe in Bitcoin as an implement of customer acquisition. Online, I do. Brick and mortar, nope. 
The only tangible benefit I can see is the saving on card processing fees.

Are brick and mortar businesses expanding their customer base by accepting Bitcoin, though? I imagine that there aren't many people who have Bitcoin but don't have a debit/credit card or fiat cash. 
You'd only actually be expanding your customer base if there was a high amount of people that can operate only in Bitcoin. This might be the case online where someone in the Philippines or whatever can now purchase stuff on your site, but in a brick and mortar store in the UK you're not going to be attracting them. Everyone entering your shop will have access to fiat.

I would hazard a guess that you've never needed to employ nor train anyone. 


I actually pay ~1.2%.. You're so far off base if you think any face to face business is paying 4% in CC fees. It's just completely unheard of. The average is 0.9%, IIRC. 


They are a huge company, and they're not brick and mortar. I explained why the same calculations can't be used for ecommerce as can be used for brick and mortar stores elsewhere in the thread.
