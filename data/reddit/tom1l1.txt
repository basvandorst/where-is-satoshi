Never sell at a loss, unless you are doing a quick trade, or unless you have too much on the line and want to get out and not come back in.
If you have too much on the line, and have to escape, then that means you invested too much that you were not willing to lose.
My strats anyways
Never sell at a loss, you might hold for 2 years just to be at even but its worth it.

Step 1
Create a account on an exchange, kraken, coinbase, poloniex, and buy your bitcoin with your credit or debit card
step 2
Since exchanges are not that safe, go ahead and create a wallet. There are ways to complicate it by creating custom wallets. But the easiest thing to do would to just download the Electrum wallet. 
I like the electrum wallet because it gives you a seed (a 12 word passphrase that you simply write down and can be used to regain your bitcoin address if anything were to fail on your computer). Electrum also allows you to further add security by easily adding a password to your account. So if some ninja did steal your 12 word passphrase, no worries, he would still have to get through your password, and in that case you would just send your bitcoin to a new account on electrum.
There are many wallets, cold storage, paper wallets, etc. You don't have to overcomplicate it if you don't want to. Buying and storing bitcoin is easy, and if its your first time just keep it simple. You can watch how to create a account on electrum through youtube, its very plain and easy to understand.
Happy bitcoin

Well I don't understand. So your telling me if it forks I will have 2 sets of coins? 
Or when I use them I have to determine which fork the coin belongs to?

This is what I don't understand.
I have 3 BTC in Electrum
How do people sell the shit coin? Because I have 3 BTC, will I automatically have 3 BU?
