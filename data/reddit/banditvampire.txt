In all seriousness, society is changing. It will not be like anything we have today. Global power structures, commerce, property, law, etc. are all changing rapidly and tptb are trying to influence it their way. Except this time its not The Great Game where the superpowers will be the deciders.
It will be everyday people. People have so much more individual power than ever before. And governments know this.
International copyright law, international cyber crime convictions, capital controls are the tools they are developing. Governments have to lock down the entire world to stay effective. Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia.
But people are crafty and can find ways to circumvent them. So its not a matter of if I will be an upstanding tax paying citizen (Im sure there are one or two of them in Detroit) but if everyone else is. I may have to rely on my chihuahuas and my two fists and not by choice. Thats why they are getting diamond teeth implants...
TL;DR We will have to redefine government and what it does to keep the institution intact.

I totally agree with you. Inflation is supposed to work by maintaining the money supply at the same level of economic growth or population growth. Traditionally at 3%. That keeps prices level because when the population grows or people get raises then there is enough dollars to keep prices up instead of down. But governments inflate much more to pay for wars and bank caused recessions. Balance is not maintained.
TBH I have no idea what a deflationary currency would be like, I have not read up on it. It is the boogey man of mainstream economists. One thing I do know is that economics is truely a political field and not a scientific one so the economic narrative is a belief system that is enforced by groupthink. 
No economist who wants a job will go against the status quo. This is why I did not become an economist.

I said harm. I consciously chose not to use the word violence. It is a subtype of warfare to starve another nations people through scarcity. 
Without outright war you can harm another nation. High food prices because of inflation through money printing caused other nations to try to keep up with their inflation efforts.

The Fed and monetary policy were always a weapon in the U.S. arsenal on par with military might.

QE is a tax on all holders of U.S. Federal dollars. A tax through money printing inflation. This includes the citizenry and countries which hold a lot of dollar reserves; economies like Japan, England and the E.U. The Fed is taking their purchasing power and transferring it to the banks. They are ok with this because money is flowing to their banks as well.
This is why inflation was much worse for other countries and led to the Arab Spring. These economies are desperately trying to devalue their currencies to compete. They would benefit if they were the only one but now its a race to the bottom.
A strong currency means less export jobs.
IMHO countries with a lot of oil can export it for a positive trade balance and have a booming internal economy. This is only anecdotal evidence but these countries are refusing to deal with the dollar more and more. Their banks do not do business with U.S. banks unless needed and are offering high interest rates on savings. Places such as Brazil, Indonesia and Russia. 
China holds a lot of dollars which they are not happy about but the U.S. is their primary market so they have to prop up the dollar to compete.

I am amazed at how far the idea has come in a year. One year ago it was only known as a payment for illegal goods and only by less than 1% of the population. Not many news stories outside of tech blogs. No major businesses dealing with it. Not many reputable exchanges. On the verge of harsh regulation.
I can't imagine how someone who was there from the beginning feels. There were a lot of bad things that happened this year but it really shook out the bad actors.
Bitcoin as an idea is mind blowing to me.
I think its increased 10x in all other accomplishments other than price. I don't think price has to increase majorly anytime soon because of the news. Maybe not even in my lifetime, but it will have more and more utility.
Can someone with more knowledge than me make a list of milestones per year from the beginning?

Just an idea but what if these companies who accept Bitcoin had direct links to Coinbase or Bitpay? 
Instead of "Pay with Bitcoin!" people are encouraged to sign up with them and pay instantly.
Let me give you the flow. I want to read a Time article online. Its 50 cents.
Link says "To read without a subscription, continue to Coinbase." Click link. Sign up for Coinbase. Kind of a hassle for 50 cents. But Coinbase has all of its partners on their website and showcases the deals you can get from them.
Once I am signed up with Coinbase I can just click on the Time article and Coinbase converts my bank account money to Bitcoin and sends it to Time. Time covers the 2 or 3% exchange fee for the 50 cents for me. Time can then do what they want with the coins. Send it to the writer or editor or web developer. Or cash out.
Then I can do this for any purchase with any participating company. Just click "Pay via Coinbase" and then I don't have to deal with Bitcoins at all.
No handling, no knowledge needed. 
This would have to be profitable for the companies after covering the exchange fee. So price and volume would have to be considered. Competition with Coinbase and Bitpay would keep percentages low.
Please critique this idea. I can see two problems. Exchanges would have make sign up much faster and they would act as a third party which people have to trust in.

What about those that do not pay taxes because they can afford accountants to minimize their liability? Are they paying for the benefits? Do I benefit when Boeing gets a large defense contract? Do I benefit when a multinational corporation pays nothing in taxes but the independent business down the street has to pay?

Why can't bitpay or coinbase refund the exact $$ amount in bitcoin to the customer? You pay 1 btc which is $1000 then request a refund and you get back whatever btc amount = $1000 since the fluctuation?

I really think it needs to stop being called "coins". It's confusing for non techies and not descriptive at all. Bitcoin plural sounds fine, but it needs a nickname descriptive of "electronic money" we should all use.
I vote "credits" and we keep them on "cred sticks"
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:01:09
Yeah, I don't either. But doesn't that cut out Paypal or credit cards and their fees? Coinbase could technically just be shuffling account money around and just be considered another credit arbiter. For the sellers this would be trading cc fees for another. Unless someone wants to hold btc.
Maybe this would make more sense to cater to an international audience? If an exchange can partner with other exchanges for world coverage will this make it possible to sell goods and services outside of the country?
Exchanges settling accounts with Bitcoin like a SEPA or transatlantic transfers?
Maybe someone with more banking experience can correct me. My credit union told me that in order to have someone outside of the country send money to my account I needed 1. My account and bank ID numbers. 
2. the bank ID for their regional bank. 
And 3. the ID for the bank they partner with for transatlantic transfers.
Now I imagine that is a lot of overhead. Whereas an exchange here and an exchange there would have made it easier and cheaper. And the exchanges don't have to rely on trust, so if one goes under then the system does not collapse. Or is this just shuffling deckchairs of money?
I believe ultimately it will take more exchanges around the world creating a web that replaces traditional banks.

can you explain how sidechains will use bitcoins in transactions? I'm not understanding the process. equilibrium may be reached with very high fee transactions right? so it's used for moving huge sums. do sidechains reserve the correct amount of btc for offchain txs or do they assume $value and just notarize it with a fraction of btc? I.e. a hub uses $100 of btc to transfer $100 value or sally gets $100 promise note on the sidechains and it says so on the blockchain?
@_date: 2016-03-05 21:52:07
free markets have a way of reaching equilibrium. what if merchants find an acceptable fee balanced with an acceptable wait time to do on chain transactions cheaper than cc's? won't that spam the network? I'm guessing it would cause fees to rise in daily business cycles

I like the cut of your jib.
If Citibank makes crypto part of their customers experience and not just in their internal systems, then who would trust the banks crypto? They can change it or inflate it at any point they want to. They could even track everything you spend it on.
Right now banks can only control or confiscate the money you have in the bank. They can't touch your cash. With crypto, all of a sudden they can make your coins useless. If the police, creditors or others want your money they can pull it right out of your pocket by not processing your coins then just giving the other parties new coins.

I have a friend that had been talking about it since 2010. He was an active miner. I had some issues where I need money for the future and remembered him. I asked him about it and he willingly sold me my first ones. I have some cash saved and am planning on using most of it to buy BTC. 
Unless I lose my job or need a major purchase I am not using it and might get better returns. It also beats sitting around losing value to inflation. I might just exchange all of my fiat. I make enough to get by.
My girlfriends father 20 years ago bought $50 worth of gold every paycheck. Guess how well that worked out for him.

@_date: 2013-11-28 01:11:07
Ok, I'm just sick of the guy but I'll try an explanation:
Intrinsic value is meaningless. Gold's price point is only partly sustained by industrial uses. It is desired. It has greater value than bitcoin in certain situations. In a world without electricity it is a great store of wealth and more valuable. 
Bitcoins can have small intrinsic value as a keeper of records. If it was loaded with very important legal and business records on the blockchain it would have some value from that. In a wired world bitcoin is the best way to transact commerce over the web, much more so than gold. Frictionless.

@_date: 2013-11-21 00:12:28
Yes it does imply lending. It means when you put $100 in the bank they only have to keep $10 and they lend out $90 but tell you your bank account still has $100 in it. They can even give you $90 of it so long as someone else has $100 in the bank. But if you took all of it out and the one they loaned the $90 doesnt pay it back then it is a bank failure.

True. So sell to someone else.

"If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, the excess can be deducted on your tax return and used to reduce other income, such as wages, up to an annual limit of $3,000, or $1,500 if you are married filing separately.
If your total net capital loss is more than the yearly limit on capital loss deductions, you can carry over the unused part to the next year and treat it as if you incurred it in that next year.
Capital gains and losses are reported on Schedule D, Capital Gains and Losses, and then transferred to line 13 of Form 1040.
For more information about reporting capital gains and losses, see the Schedule D instructions, Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses or Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax. All forms and publications are available on this website or by calling 800-TAX-FORM  (800-829-3676)."

The timescale is important to consider.I think realistically it could take over some industries in the short term but will be forever in getting adopted by nations. Someone correct my math but if bitcoin gets to 100 billion market cap it goes to about 8333 per bitcoin. Thats a large cap and there are only about 60 companies at that level. So 1 coin is not going to make anyone millionaires. 1 trillion USD for 1 BTC brings it to 83333 each. And how long before we get to a trillion market cap?
So this might not make anyone rich but its as good an investment as any.

@_date: 2013-11-21 19:18:06
I want to be able to pay bills with bitcoin. Gas, electric, insurance. It would be so much easier. That I would spend immediately
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:28:19
No, what am I going to do with it? Watch it lose value in the bank?
I have nothing to buy. I work to pay my bills. Cashing out $1000 is not going to make me feel "safe" of my investments in btc.
Unless you have something you want to buy its the long game for me. Unless I can buy it in btc.

And this is why the Foundation needs to silence the critics tomorrow by telling the government that the Chinese will "Drink your milkshake". Adapt or become irrelevant.

Thanks. I might but only my blockchain account was hacked. Nothing else.

If bitcoins really take off to replace global currencies and I become a dollar trillionaire then I would definitely donate to individuals and communities that missed the boat and were left with worthless paper money. I would only keep what I needed to live and use the rest to better my community. Because if paper money collapsed that badly then the world would be bad place for many people.

Thank you for your answers. I was asked all of this tonight from a skeptic and I didn't have good answers for him. It should be posted around more that the idea is that you are your own bank. You must protect your money but no one can take it from you or charge you overdraft fees or other fees like banks do.

Yes, like if gyft made one uniform card with btc and not usd for all of their merchants.

Can I give a big thank you to you and everyone else that was involved up until this point? Thank you for changing the world. It doesn't matter if you made or lost money. You're curiosity put us all here now.
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:23:53
If that is true then don't you also get to deduct the loss on a trade from your taxes? So if the value went down when you cashed out that is a business loss? 
There you go. Sell it to your spouse at a loss and you're set.
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:04:46
It can be anything. Just put into it the amount of money you want.

Who is selling off a this time of day? Are US holders the "weak hand"?
Why would anyone sell off right before China wakes up and shoots it higher? It cant be institutional investors

Teach them to buy bitcoins and let them buy Apple products on their own. With Gyft cards or something. We want them to start using it regularly.

This is true. I panicked through my first 2 corrections but cold storage. So this last one was fine. The value will rise, too many eyes on it now.
@_date: 2013-11-03 16:21:32
You're thinking the old way. Bitcoins aren't stocks and bonds. What are dividends paid in? Dollars. The value of which is falling everyday compared to real goods. Bitcoin is a replacement in the long run, not a complement. Although I do believe there will be an equilibrium someday.
If this was all just run on speculation then it would just fall to zero someday

What did they think of it? Any actions?
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:49:26
Does no one understand this isnt a stock? These aren't "bubbles". We are reaching a point where this is a direct vote on peoples faith in their currency. Some countries are using it as a side savings fund, others are using it as a replacement of quickly inflating currencies and others are buying because their current money is worthless.
People are trading national currencies for cryptocurrencies. It shows which one they have more faith in. If a nation had a solid currency now Im sure you would not see many buyers from that country.

When I first heard about bitcoin I had been complaining about the world financial situation being terrible and everyone was suffering except for the privileged few. An entire planet of mismanaged economies. 
Bitcoin has a purpose. Its not just to get rich. It can actually change things. I see now how the old systems are dinosaurs and bitcoin is the meteor.

Yes, this is what I am waiting for. Pay your electric bill directly and quickly. They should offer a discount for the option. Cuts down on payment processing of checks or CC's, waiting times for the check, manpower to sort and process the payments, reduce late payments. I would pay all of my bills in bitcoin.

How many here hold bitcoins now but their families don't? I am saving all of mine to provide for my family. I do think we will see it replace fiat in our lifetimes and it will be a chaotic road. For those of you who have never been outside of the country, society is thinly held together. In America there has mostly been stability so that people think its set in stone. Money, government, food, work, peace. These have all been in nonexistent in most countries around the globe in the last 100 years at one time or another. 
Africa will lead the way in bitcoin society, getting along without government. There will be winners and losers in the future. I volunteer with meals on wheels. There are too many elderly people without families to take care of them. If I somehow hold onto my small stack and make it to the replacement of fiat I am going to help those that need it. This is a reboot to the system and to go back to the old way of bankers stealing grandma and grandpas retirement savings leaving them to die for profit would be a betrayal of the better world we could create.

It's a feedback loop. Some people are using it as a savings from inflation or speculation. Then business, enticed by the wealth, needs to build the infrastructure.
Then industry uses it in their supply chain or workforce. Then it becomes used by everyone. 
Any hold up in the chain and prices will fall.  That's why we need more businesses and front end apps to keep pace with growth. That's why everyone here should start working on or contacting those companies they would actually buy from with HTC.

Another exchange is always good. Maybe they can offer a mixing and holding service for wealthy clients who want to hide and protect their bitcoins?
Or if they have worldwide branches maybe they can use bitcoins as a money moving service for all of their locations. They can even just do it internally. 
Someone wants to move 100k Francs to Taiwan? Exchange the francs into bitcoin then send them to the Taiwan branch and convert them back. 
Almost instant. The only problem is they might need a bitcoin trading/exhange team to buy and sell to locals. 
I hope that makes sense
