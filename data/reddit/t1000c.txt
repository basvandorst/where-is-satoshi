$30 USD for a single Bitcoin transaction? Jesus fucking Christ.
Thank God the Russians and North Koreans have to use it to move money now, because otherwise I can't imagine how anyone could use Bitcoin as a currency anymore, or why it would hold any value. 
Do you have any idea what it used to cost to send a transaction (and what it still costs with every other crypto)? Pennies.

Oh burn! 
I'm sure you have a doctorate in climate science and have researched it for years!! You're definitely not some old man who hates the world, or an unpaid intern working for some Exxon-funded denalist group! ([Exxon knew about climate change 40 years ago]( BTW) 
You have totally disproven the global consensus on climate change. Hurry up and tell the world! What are you doing on Reddit right now, shouldn't you be accepting your Nobel prize for saving humanity from the largest conspiracy in history?
@_date: 2015-12-18 09:14:55
How about the fact that there are regular posts about people waiting weeks to get money out of Quadriga? The suspicion I've heard in the local bitcoin community is that they are insolvent, although I suspect (hope?) they are just understaffed and poorly run. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 02:24:41
I agree with all those points, but I can't find an explanation for modifying those posts. That is not Satoshi's style either.
If he wanted people to know his identity he could easily prove it. This makes no sense whatsoever.

So they actually have a way that you can withdraw CAD now? That's an improvement at least. 
I had about $8k CAD in there when they lost their bank account a few weeks back. After waiting about two weeks for them to get set up with "Vogogo" or whatever, I traded for BTC and cashed them out on bitstamp. 
I lost at least 5% doing that.

Didn't think about that, I am stupid. 
I always did find it funny that Satoshi's Dorian comment came from an obscure account, as opposed to his primary email, or bitcointalk account. Perhaps that is one that Wright had access to/operated?
Who knows. It's all speculation until someone proves it.

Well, back here in society we have these things called laws and regulations... 
@_date: 2015-12-09 06:00:12
For sure it could have been. I don't think we'll ever know the truth, unless someone proves that they are Satoshi by signing with his PGP key or his known Bitcoin addresses.
Even if that does happen, it's still not 100% proof, but it's the best we can ever hope for.
I suppose that the Satoshi bitcointalk account would be totally worthless at this point, since BCT has been compromised more times than Windows 95.
@_date: 2015-12-18 20:32:12
True enough. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 02:06:43
This guy is obviously just seeking attention. If Satoshi wanted to reveal himself, he'd sign a message with his original PGP key or one of his known addresses.
This guy can't go that, so he "leaked" documents to this Gwern dude, and Wired bought it.
The fact that he edited his posts in 2013 to ADD the "evidence" proves this beyond any doubt, as far as I'm concerned. He was hoping someone would "discover" it, and when no one did, he leaked them.
I am surprised Wired would publish this bullshit. They must be desperate to increase their page views.

@_date: 2015-12-09 02:41:12
I agree that this is the more likely case. I don't doubt that he was an early adapter and could have worked with Satoshi. 
Perhaps it was Kleiman, and now that he is dead Wright is trying to steal the publicity. Kleiman died in 2013, exactly when Wright started editing posts to claim publicity. 
He seems bitter that people don't take his academic papers as seriously as he wishes they did. Perhaps he wants the Nobel prize?
@_date: 2015-12-09 02:02:41
He did it once with Dorian Nakamoto, I assume because of how much publicity there was around one was, and because the "journalist" stated as a fact that she had discovered his identity. 
He might, but I can't imagine he'll keep doing that every time there is speculation like this.

Sorry, I should have specified, I'm a 35 year old with a BSC in chemistry and I still read scientific journals for my day job. I'm not a 16 year old kid who is stupid enough to believe denialist nonsense. 
Obviously I'm not going to waste my time researching and refuting all of the studies listed in that article, because I understand and follow science. The fact that you think that there is a global conspiracy amongst climate researchers to trick the public into believing in anthropogenic climate change (the only plausible explanation if it is not happening) is enough to tell anyone reasonable to ignore your nonsense.
Not to mention the fact that the page you linked to begins with studies/papers from 1991. Derp.
Presumably you are a troll paid for by some denialist group, or just a contrarian who "hates liberals" and listens to very stupid and/or disingenuous people. I feel sorry for you if you are the latter, if you are the former please GFY.
I know that you are not going to consider anything other than far-right/corporatist nonsense, but in case anyone reads this exchange and is actually considering taking your points seriously:


Believe whomever you want, read the research, or study it yourself. Just don't get your science from a "libertarian" economics source or far-right talk radio.
As far as I know, no study has proven that 97% of ALL SCIENTISTS accept the proof that climate change is significantly increased by man-made greenhouse gasses. The study you refer to proves the following:


I know, it's shocking that a climate change denier would twist words and data around to fit their purpose. /S

CaVirtex has been around for many years and has seen over $100 million+ traded there. For many years they were extremely quick to respond to support requests, and processed transactions faster than anyone I've seen (domestic wires arrived the next day like clockwork for years, and their credit cards and debit cards were loaded the same day).
Canada doesn't have a more reliable exchange.
Until they were purchased by Coinsetter, they were one of the most trustworthy and reliable exchanges on earth.

@_date: 2016-01-16 05:59:28
I just got a new, much longer one.


The original of idea bitcoin is to create a decentralized money system that prevents censorship and being shutdown. Proof of work seemed like a good way to achieve that. The real power in the bitcoin world is helt by the miners, as long as the mining process is properly decentralized bitcoin will be decentralized. But real world competition caused many cracks to appear in this model, the first flaws that appeared were pooled mining (centralizing power with mining operators), then came ASICs (Centralizing power with mining operators with good industry connections), then came cheap electricity + latency issues (Centralizing power with mining pools with access to cheap electicity and low latency to others big mining pools). These pressures has essentially caused mining to be centalized mainly in China because there they have cheap electricity, good industry for creating ASICs and low latency to other chinese mining pools (and high latency to the rest of the world).
One important thing to keep in mind is that bitcoin itself can evade capital controls and move seamlessly accross borders. But mining equipment cannot. It would be easy to confiscate all mining equipment in the country and use it to destroy bitcoin.
So what is the solution to this problem? Proof of stake is the solution because it removed the physical element and allows network voting power to move seamlessly accross borders too. Traditional Proof of Stake contains some flaws like the Nothing at Stake problem. But the new algorithm designed for proof of stake in Ethereum solved all these issues.
The bitcoin developer community has proven that it is unable to make even small changed to the consesus algorithm. So completely switching to a different model is never going to happen.
If you are willing to open your mind and learn about how Ethereum will beat bitcoin by being far superior to bitcoin watch the videos of Devcon1
Bitcoin is doomed and Ethereum will replace it.
Obviously most people involved in Ethereum are aware of this. But for most other people it is not so obvious. But it is hard to convince the masses because they are not reading enough information about Ethereum, either because of censorship in subs or because of denial.
Therefore I think it is the mission of each of us to get the word out. Only by saying it often and giving clear examples we can teach the masses what we already know. Try to reach at least on uninformed person every day. (If you lack ideas, just post the link to this post in different reddit subs with target audience).
First of all it is important to remind people that Bitcoin was also once small, and that people also did not believe in Bitcoin because they couldn't imagine what benefit it would give over conventional payment systems. That perception changed dramatically for bitcoin and the same will happen to Ethereum. It is important to emphasise this because people often use the psychological principle of Social Proof to make decisions in unknown situations, this is currently working against Ethereum, the underlying reasoning is, "If Ethereum is so great why is it so cheap?", "If Ethereum is so great why is everyone talking about Bitcoin?", "If Ethereum is so great, why are the smart people X, Y and Z not invested in it?".
Second of all it is important to emphasise that not only is Ethereum a crypto that offers a whole new concept of the decentralized web, it is also better than Bitcoin at being a currency for payments. This is easy to show by explaining a real world scenario. Imagine the perfect crypto currency, obviously it should be possible to re-implement the most convenient payment systems used today using that crypto currency, and doing so in a decentralized way, with no added fees or middle man. It should be able to behave very much like cash in being able to spend it quick and easy. The most similar electronic product that offers this is the anonymous tap to pay, prepaid payment card. It is easy, it is anonymous, it wont be hacked like phones, it has the ability to limit exposure to compromise by having limited balance that automatically recharged and the end of the day. Implementing this in Bitcoin would not be possible because the small chip in the card is not connected to the internet, and sharing your private key is a security hazard. But what if your wallet/contract could use asymmetric encryption to accept a different secret payment key on every payment. This way it is possible to implement the payment with a touch to pay card in a secure way. In Ethereum it is also possible to program a contract to recharge a wallet at the end of every day for added security, It is also possible to automatically exchange Ethereum for a token that is backed by a stable currency for those merchants that are worried about exchange fluctuations.
Third of all it is important to note that Bitcoin is never going to be implementing these changes. Look how hard it is for them to implement a blocksize increase. Changing the scripting language to Turing complete would be a far more controversial change. One that the miners will probably never agree to this. And also keep in mind that quick payments need either zero-confirmation transactions or fast blocktime.
So if Ethereum has the potential to implement the most convenient payment system imaginable but Bitcoin cannot then one can only conclude that Ethereum will win in the long run. Bitcoin will die like Myspace, and Ethereum will become the golden standard.

Agree, one of my all-time favorites.
I went as him for Halloween one year in university, this is in the early aughts. I shit you not, one person actually got it right away. (I wasn't carrying a book of his or a pen or anything, just a wine bottle). Tried to make my hair like his (in his later days), dyed gray/white, and I borrowed a glasses case for my shirt pocket like he often [wore]( A few others got it after I did my terrible impression of his voice and mannerisms.
Could not believe it when the one girl nailed it, right away. My Chomsky the year previous only had people thinking that I was a goofy dresser for my age and too lazy to put on a costume.
As I type this I am realizing that I was kind of weird in college. I guess I didn't care because I got laid every week. Now it's saturday night and I'm on reddit, and playing around with my cat and dog.

Indeed I do, securely stored in multiple locations right alongside my cold wallet keys (made using Armory, never been online).
I even made sure not to write the key down with other paper underneath, just in case. I'm paranoid as all hell about things of this nature.
Great tip for those who may be newer to the Trezor/Bitcoin that I am. I've been using this thing as my primary hot wallet for almost a year now, never had any trouble whatsoever before this.
Will definitely do some research on Electrum and probably set myself up with that. Thanks again mate.

Sorry to hear that, I sincerely hope it isn't disrupting your business/purchasing too much, but if I'm being honest I am glad others are having the exact same issue. It means they will fix it faster!
Did you email Trezor support? If you have a second please do, to help light a fire under their asses. It's support
Strangely when you send an email to that address, it automatically sets you up with a support ticket account, and sends you a password by plain text! I realize you can change it, but still that is terrible opsec from a Bitcoin security company. Surely there is a better way! If I didn't love that crew I would submit them to plaintextoffenders.com.

It's basically a decentralized ebay with almost no fees right? But at the same it can't be used for nefarious purposes because it doesn't work on the "dark net"? Sounds like it can't miss if they can get it done, but of course that's always a big "if".

I personally think Bitcoin is a great medium/long term investment. However it's hard to honestly say real estate is MORE risky.   ;-)

Most of the blood would come from the people who sold at $300 banging their heads against the wall.

I hope it works out, but it's not a good sign that  only has 285 twitter followers. 
I am not being sarcastic when I say that my grandmother has over 300.

So what you're saying is buy low, sell high? That sounds like an amazing strategy.
You may want to write a book.

One way to know when someone is not "rich" is when they don't understand what the term equity means.

This. Basically just wait a few hours and it will show only your actual balance. 
In the mean time your coin is safe and can be sent like normal.

There is also about a $30 premium right now at US exchanges/Bitstamp compared to Canadian exchanges (cavirtex). 
I have no idea why. Not enough liquidity on the Canadian exchanges perhaps. It's certainly an arbitrage opportunity.

This smells like a setup. I first heard of Bitnodes.io yesterday. Now the big merger.
Forgive me for being a skeptic.

Couldn't it start as downloadable and then eventually move to http/app functionality? 
Bitcoin has done something similar, although admittedly most http/app usage still relies on third parties. BlockChain.info is fairly close to using btc without a third party, since you can import/export private keys, push transactions, etc.
Enthusiasts, like most of us here, are happy to use electrum/bitcoin core/armory etc, but most casual users just want an app or a website to log into to use bitcoin. If us diehards can help get OpenBazaar off to a good start, I hope and assume that web/app functionality will emerge to allow more casual users access to it.
Of course, I'm an eternal optimist and have almost no understanding of the underlying technology,  so I could be dead wrong about all that.

I had exactly the same thought process!
Then I started thinking of the ways I weasel out of my current alarms. I've wrapped a towel around a phone and thrown it down the stairs into the basement before, because I didn't want to solve the math problem that would have woken me up. Not proud of it, just a fact.
In addition to feeling good about the charity, don't forget the tax refund. It would probably make me sleep even better than before.
Plus I wouldn't put it past my mostly-sleeping self to think, hey, I'll just let this happen and then contact the charity tomorrow and tell them my software screwed up and I accidentally donated $1000 when I only meant to send $100, and could they please send the difference back. 
Of course, being a charity, the good folks there would likely send it right back and thank me for my $100.
And I still missed my flight.
No, it has to be a burn address.
Also... this is the greatest idea I've ever heard, as someone who has slept through NFL tickets, flights, and countless moderately important business meetings. 
Build it and we will come.

No personal offense intended, but that may be indicative of the fact that you think $100k is a ton of money.

So, how are missing anything? It sounds like the .37 got confirmed. 
The second, unconfirmed transaction that you see is due to the malleability attack, and has nothing to do with blockchain.info.

It's a childish fantasy because, without a government, who prevents the most violent people from dominating everyone else? Who enforces your sacred NAP?
Don't say stupid things and then get offended when people call you stupid.
@_date: 2016-07-22 21:25:06


Never, because we have built functioning (if imperfect) collective societies, over thousands of years. That is why your childish fantasy of "anarcho-capitalism" is so absurd.
