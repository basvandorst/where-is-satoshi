Hey thanks for the comprehensive FAQ!
Not sure if somewhere it has been explained before but here goes my question: how can one access a wallet in order to check/withdraw funds with just its QR code?

Hey thanks, your explanation was helpful. I am still not sure how to do what I want; let me put it this way: I created a wallet some time ago and someone sent me some btc and now all the info I have for the wallet is its qr code, is there a way for me to access the wallet's balance?
Edit: I'm pretty sure I created it with my android phone, does it matter what app I used to create it originally?
Edit 2: I've been going deep with this btc shit now and here is an update on what I think I've understood: (1) the qr code I have for the wallet apparently decodes to an address like "bitcoin://SomethingSomething?amount=0" and so the Block Explorer does not recognize it. (2) when I simplify the address to just the SomethingSomething --which is a long string of characters you guys probably call the bitcoin Address-- the Block Explorer says there are no transactions involving that address. Also the qr code is different for the simplified address than the one I had shared originally.
My question now is, did I f*** it up when I shared the  qr code for the long "bitcoin://SomethingSomething?amount=0" address? Meaning, no transactions were ever possible using that qr code, right?
