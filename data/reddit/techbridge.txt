BTW, anyone has a contact at Verisart? Willing to register BTC fine art on BTC based service. Applied for invitation weeks ago.

Come on, Bitcoin folks! Support the artist! At another chain they gave almost a thousand upvotes. Let's show who is the King! 
@_date: 2018-09-03 16:35:19
Pretty much so!
We all got a second chance to fix this world.

Thanks, 
It is "old school" oil on canvas fine artwork telling the most important story of modern and disruptive tech.
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:33:43
Nope, just fragments from Bitcoin core code by SN.

Thanks,  More beautiful stuff to come soon!
P.S. I am Sasha from Blockgeeks and Nelly's husband ;)
BTW, we started using Codex for on-chain title registration:  
did not find ant BTC based working solution. Any ideas?

Verisart looks legit! Thanks, tldr-hodl! Will try them for the coming BTC work.

Those are acrylic paintings on round canvases.

It is the very and only one Black and Gold Artist proof (enhanced limited edition print). To make it special Nelly added "1010" binary on the Miner's t-shirt using REAL 24K gold leaf from Italy. There is gold leaf on the Bitcoin key as well ;) And code fragments are all by SN from BTC 2009 repository. Bid here:
Happy bidding!

People see, people like, no sales required ;)

I just recalled myself reacting to SMS - who the fuck would use it if you already had a luxury of voice calling from your expensive and brick-size mobile phone!
