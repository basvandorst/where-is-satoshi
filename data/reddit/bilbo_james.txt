Vanity Addresses
there's always a risk involved if you let someone else generate an address for you, but there is software available that you can do it yourself.
simple ones like 1rechxxxxx  would be easy.  1rechemxxxx  difficult and 1rechemco would be impossible.
just google it and make sure you download a signed, safe version.

This is the age old problem of not being able to understand the basics of something because they’re complex and you don’t understand the underlying technologies.
Who could explain how a helicopter stays aloft to someone who doesn’t understand basic laws of physics?
Mining is the process of taking the existing blockchain (a list of every bitcoin transaction ever) and adding another bunch of transactions onto the end of it.
Whoever creates the new, longer blockchain first, gets to add a special transaction in which 12.5 new bitcoins are allocated to himself. 
In order to make it difficult to create the new, longer blockchain, a massively difficult mathematical problem must be solved. Once it’s solved, the new blockchain is published to all the other miners and they all stop work on their current chain and start working on the new, longer one.
In reality, it’s much more complicated than that, but hopefully gives you a grasp.

oh, how I hope this is for real.
@_date: 2016-08-11 13:08:53
I used VanityGen, didnt know that bitcoin-qt had that functionality.
There was also a site that I used (only for playing) that would generate them for you. It used two part addresses, and bitaddress.org 's vanity address feature. Anything over 7 characters, case sensitive was either massively expensive or unlikely to ever be found.
the other problem you'll have is that you cant have certain characters in an address. The uppercase letter "O", uppercase letter "I", lowercase letter "l", and the number "0" are never used to prevent visual ambiguity.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:45:51
by design, the bitcoin protocol expects the new transactions to be added to the old blockchain every 10 minutes and therefore it expects 1 miner out of all the millions of miners, to come up with the correct answer to the problem about every 10 minutes.
if it was easy (i.e. there wasn't a really difficult math problem to solve), then the miners would come up with the correct answer too quickly. 
The clever bit is that the difficulty of solving the problem increases or decreases depending on how quickly the miners come up with the solution. If they're solving it too quickly, the problem gets harder; if they're taking too long, it gets easier.
Once all 21 million bitcoins have been mined, the miners will not get a reward, but will still get the miners fee that is attached to all the transactions that they add to the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:56:44
Glad you found the pretty simplistic description helpful; hope it makes you dig around and get a better understanding. Do a little reading each day, start with the White Paper, (  it's really quite digestible.
And no one is "in control" over anything related to bitcoin. All the rules are already built into the code; and if a change is made to the code and all the miners agree to the change, then it becomes the new code. 
The current code states that every 210,000 blocks, the miner's reward will be cut in half, it was originally 50 bitcoins, it recently dropped to 12.5 from 25
It also states that when 21 million bitcoins have been mined, then no more will be created (by rewarding miners).

When I first started looking at bitcoin I had the idea that eventually all the bitcoins would be chopped up as people spent them and got change back, and everyone would be left with loads of dust.
Obviously utter tosh, and I'm better educated now but I'm sure many newbies live under this same misapprehension.
However, it doesn't explain why my bedside table is littered with 1p and 2p coins !!

 $1,000. You could go to Vegas and multiply that by 10,or you could lose the lot. Chances are stacked against you and you'll probably lose the lot.
The view of pretty much everyone here is if you put it into BTC, the chances, long term, of losing it all are pretty small, and eventually you "might" come out with more.
Place your bets, there's no way of knowing which way it will go.

When you spend from a paper wallet, it's important to transfer all the funds out otherwise the change may go to a different address and you'll lose it.
Typically, you should transfer from a paper wallet into a hot wallet, spend what you want from the hot wallet, then transfer excess back into a NEW paper wallet. 
Alternatively, if you fully trust the paper wallet, i.e. you created it yourself safely and weren't given it by someone else, then you can import it into a hot wallet.

To be as safe as possible, you've got to master cold storage, paper wallets are the simplest, but there are still pitfalls.
I boot an old laptop with a Ubuntu CD. I've got a USB stick with a copy of bitaddress.org which I load up from the clean running Ubuntu. Then I print out paper wallets. These are then about as safe as you can get.
You've then got to practice moving very small amounts from your hot wallet (maybe blockchain or an exchange) into the paper wallet. If you get them into the paper wallet, then practice getting them back out again (called sweeping) into a hot wallet. 
Always move the entire contents of a paper wallet out, never try to move only a part of it out.
 
If you master getting a few satoshis in and out of paper wallets, you're ready to move to larger amounts.

Firstly, congratulations, you've landed a great role.
You've also got a huge challenge as you're no doubt aware.
The main problem you've got to overcome is that it's virtually impossible to explain the concept of cryptography and bitcoin to "ordinary" business people, it's just too complex.
I liken it to early aviators explaining the concept of flight to non-believers, they wouldn't listen. But a fly-past - hey, that's cool.
So my suggestion is don't focus on the technical detail, deep or otherwise; explain the higher level benefits. Use the classic analogy of email 15 years ago.
Hope it goes well, let us know.

The first question everyone's going to ask is, where are you?

and here's the proof ..
200 bits @_date: 2014-02-28 22:28:48
easiest way is..
go to bitaddress.org and store the page (View/ Source) then save the resulting html file, preferably on a usb.
Have a clean PC available, ideally one that has never been online, and save the html file onto it.
load up the file, it will open a browser and will generate paper wallets, single wallets, brain wallets, vanity wallets, all sorts.
Generate as many paper wallets as you need and print them, ideally on a locally connected dumb printer.
Then send your btc to the public addresses of the paper wallets and file them away safely. When you want to spend from a paper wallet, sweep the entire contents into a hot wallet (blockchain or similar). DO NOT PART-SPEND FROM A PAPER WALLET, you'll run the risk of losing the change.

transfer the bitcoins out of the newly restored wallet quickly. Be careful where you put them, but it will only be temporary so Blockchain will do. Then create a new mycelium wallet, note the new seed, move the coins back into the new wallet from Blockchain and carry on as normal.
If you don't move them out of your current wallet, anyone who finds your lost phone has access to your coins.
@_date: 2017-02-23 07:26:50
the transaction fee will never expire. Once the transaction has been built by your wallet and transmitted to the network, that's it, it can't change.
If the fee wasn't high enough, the transaction will just get constantly bumped out of the list the miners are working from for a higher paying transaction. As there's 90,000 unconfirmed transactions at present, it likely to be either a very long time, or it will eventually get dropped from the miner's list of outstanding transactions (the mempool) and you'll be able to send them again from your wallet.
If you want to, you could post the transaction ID here and someone will tell you how much you paid and when it's likely to confirm. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 13:16:02

@_date: 2017-02-07 19:52:00
unfortunately, it's several days. 
Think of your wallet as having many compartments, each of which holds different value bills. When you go to pay someone, the wallet selects a number of bills from the various compartments in your wallet, the total value of which exceeds the amount you want to spend. It then sends all these separate bills to the recipient, with a note to send the change back to another compartment in your wallet. 
The nodes have got a record that you've already sent one more of those bills to someone and they think you're trying to spend the same bills again. So they block it, marking it as a double spend.
If you want to send someone some bitcoin, it is possible to select different compartments in your wallet and use bitcoins that haven't already been sent. Only some wallets have this feature though.
your best bet is to just wait. It'll sort itself out.
@_date: 2017-02-23 08:26:23
That'll be the problem. You paid 65 sat/byte. Current transactions are going through with 600, 700 or 800 sat/byte so the chances of it getting picked up are very low. The lowest fee in the last block was 120 sat/byte 
Wait.  As with your first transaction, it will eventually confirm or it will get dropped and you'll be able to spend them from your wallet again. Might take another day or so though.
@_date: 2017-02-22 12:20:23
the difference is that if someone steals your Trezor, or you lose it, there's no risk of losing your coins.
Simply buy another one, or fire up a Trezor compatable wallet, enter your 24 word recovery and you're back in control of your coins.

create 1,000 wallets. Take the bitcoin you want to launder and split it into a sub-bunch of those wallets, then take those wallets and split again into some others, repeat. Pretty soon, the branches will be too diverse to follow properly. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 15:57:36
Your first “spend” never confirmed, so the bitcoins never left your wallet in the first place.
However, many nodes will still have a record of the attempt to spend them held in their mempool.
So when they see the same coins trying to be spent again, they reject the transaction as double spend.
Eventually, the mempools clear and nodes will begin accepting the attempt to spend the original coins.

I'm a regular user of this ATM, buying £10 or £20 to keep my hot wallet topped up. In it's early days, it took £20 and didn't transfer the btc. I phoned the contact number on the machine and the owner was luckily downstairs. He came up, apologised (buggy s/w update apparently) and sorted it out immediately. 
Nice guy, nice cafe (I'm not a vaper) and I've trusted it ever since. 
Huge spread however, should you want to sell.

If you lose your recovery seed but still have your Trezor, you can obtain the seed from the Trezor once it's unlocked.
You should then move your bitcoin out, create a new recovery seed (i.e trash the old wallet), then move the bitcoin back into the new one. Then, whoever finds your "lost" booklet, doesn't get your bitcoin.
If you lose you recovery seed and your Trezor, you're b0IIox'd.

If I send three transactions to the same address, how is the total value held? 
Is it held as three separate inputs (which seems the obvious answer) or are the three inputs held separately? (under one address)
I created a laminated public address in QR format that I used at an ATM several times. When I check the total value it is the correct accummulation of all the payments. How does this work?

one of the words you wrote down is incorrect. Maybe you wrote colour instead of color (or vice versa) or peek instead of peak, something like that.

you won't know if it will get confirmed (maybe a miner will pick it up and include it in a block), or whether it will get dropped until one or the other happens. There is no way to predict the outcome.
On the front r/bitcoin page there is an article on how to force a stuck transaction, but there are dependancies and it's not a trivial task, especially if the btc are already marked as double spent.
If I were you I'd just wait.
@_date: 2014-08-07 08:52:04
So that you look like a pro when you arrive, here’s two things that might help you out.
 
After you press BUY, the machine prints out a transaction slip. Take it out of the slot because nothing happens until you do.
 
The scanner that you hold your phone up to is waist height, under the screen, I think. I looked a right dick holding my phone in front of every orifice on the machine before working it out.
 
If it’s not working, there are two more within 10 mins walking distance, The Old Shoreditch Station Café and VapeLabs, Shorditch High St. Both brilliant.
 
Good luck
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:42:33
yes, apologies, you're right. Price isn't immaterial, but as there is no way of knowing whether the best time to buy is today, tomorrow or next week, if you're contemplating jumping onboard, then you might as well do it now and go with the ups and downs. Don't worry about what the price is today.

Just to clarify, in case you're confused, you dont need to have the blockchain on your pc.
Get a good software wallet. Mycelium, Electrum (google it or search this subreddit for recommendations). They're free, simple, safe and most importantly, you own the private keys to your bitcoins and are therefore free from risk of an exchange disappearing with your cache.

Most people's opinion on the bitcoin forums is don't put your money into cloud or pool mining, put the money directly into bitcoins themselves. If you think it through, it's logical really.
If bitcoin does increase in value dramatically, your mining investment won't earn as much as if you'd bought bitcoins.
If bitcoin tanks, you'd have lost your money whatever way you chose.
My personal advise  - go through the pain (kyc etc.) of setting yourself up on an exchange such as Coinbase or Gemini (do some research for the best in your country), then poke a few $ or £ or whatever away each month.
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:45:04

You really won't get any serious, definitive answers here. The best you can hope for are truthful, generic answers that rely on your own research and aptitude.
You might as well ask what car should I buy, where should I buy it and what will it be worth in the future.
So here's some generic answers.
Blockchain.info for a hot wallet, Electrum for a safe wallet, Trezor for hardware wallet.
Go through the sign up process with Coinbase, Circle or one of the other established exchanges for best prices, or 
Locabitcoins or a BTC ATM for small amounts at bad prices.
Yes, it's as good a time as any to buy, but only put in what you're prepared to lose, completely.

The short answer is there isn't really any such thing as a bitcoin account, and you don't register anywhere.
You simply need a wallet. Your wallet provides you with a Public Address that people can send funds to.

the very latest mined block, clearly showing the "last" transaction, timed 2016-06-13 19:11:11 is the very last transaction in the block.
every other transaction was timed earlier. Yes, I know times on blockchain aren't exactly ntp, but logic says the miner takes transactions as they see them, adds them to their work, add the reward and fee, then add the nonce to their calcs.

The ~~last~~ first transaction in every mined block is a transaction for newly mined coins, plus all the fees from every transaction in the block, to be sent to the miner's address.
Originally, the reward was 50 newly mined coins, currently it is 25 coins, after July's halvening it will drop to 12.5 coins.
The value of bitcoin isn't directly affected by the halvening, no one really knows what effect it will have on the price.
The amount of work needed to be put into mining doesn't change either; that's the difficulty change and that can go up or down depending on how fast coins are being mined.
Yes, it is detrimental to the mining community; they're taking a 50% pay cut.

most bitcoiners here fully understand the interest in mining and, like you, know they're never going to make anything out of it. Honestly, you're looking at actually getting zero back because the mining pools don't let you withdraw the minuscule amount of satoshis you'll earn, so they end up keeping your dust.
That said, there is the tech side that many want to learn. There are a few very good step by step guides to setting up a Raspberry Pi running with an ASIC, Google Raspberry Pi bitcoin miner.
£30 for the Pi, £30 for an ASIC and an SD card, three hours work and you're set up ready to go with minimum costs.
while you're at it, buy £60 in bitcoin and sit on it.
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:27:45
the problem isn't one of free power producing free bitcoins, the problem is that you will never mine enough to get to the minimum withdrawal amount that the pools require.
If you ran and ASIC for a year, you would make less than $1 at today's difficulty.
Put the money you're planning to spend on hardware into buying btc directly.

If the price is £600 per bitcoin, then £90 would get you 0.15 btc

load it up with a few satoshi, add a few more, move some out, wipe it, restore it, check the little bit of satoshi are back.

B cannot create the transaction to C until the transaction from A to B has been created and broadcast.

Used them because they're quick, easy, no long-winded signup for low cost purchases.
their rates are much worse than exchanges, not a problem for low cost (&lt; $100) purchases.

here's the best advice you'll get today, this week, this month.
Take the money you're about to spend on a miner and buy bitcoins directly - localbitcoins is quickest and simplest.
You will NEVER make even 10% of what you lay out on the miner, even in the best pool. That's forgetting about the electricity costs, cooling etc.
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:31:04
imagine this scenario. You've got 4 btc and they're valued at $1500 each. If there's a fork (like Eth did a while back), you will have 4 btc(orig) and 4 btf(forked). They will have different values, say btc = $1000 and btf = $500.
So you have the same total value over two different coins. In reality, the price will drop quite a bit due to the uncertainty, but eventually it will pick back on the "winning' chain, and the 4 btc's or btf's will recover.

If you want to buy from an ATM, you will be limited to something like £200 - £300 in a single transaction due to kyc/ aml
Localbitcoins on the other hand you'll be able to buy larger amount, but you will need to register. If you do it as an unregistered "guest", again, you'll be limited in how much you can buy.
My advice would be buy as much as you can now, then start the ball rolling and register on an exchange. Coinbase works well for me in UK.

You will continue to have your 4 coins on both chains until you move them. Once you move the coins on either chain, (i.e. move the coins to another address/wallet or pay someone), then those coins you moved will only be available on that chain. 
In a nutshell, ordinary users won't need to do anything following the fork other than ensuring they have fully up to date wallets.

Here, have a coffee it's actually worth while going through the kyc process and setting up with someone like Circle, Coinbase, Bittylicious etc, then you can easily purchase whenever you like.  If you wanted to set up Paypal, Amazon etc, you would need to associate with a bank account, there's no difference.

I think the big money will be made when we run out of addresses.
I'm going to create a couple of thousand and keep them stored safely.
Then, when we run out, I'll sell them

Whilst it's infuriating, can you imagine the strain their support will be under at present.
For every genuine "I've forgot my password/ login/ authy" call they get, there will be 10 hackers trying the same thing. 
The boiler plate responses are designed to help - automated recovery processes etc.

bluegamebits - OP here. Your reply is the best answer to the question - how do we make the next step. I had never heard of Volabit or meXBT and they are doing exactly what we need. We need more of these sort of companies.
Being able to walk into a local store and exchange btc either way - perfect. Am I alone in this coming as a revelation?
I’m very happy for Mexico - the new frontier.  African outback next :-/

In reality, this is what does happen.
Improvements in hash rate by faster hardware, makes mining new blocks faster than the required 10 minutes. The "lucky" miner makes more than all the others (on average).
Difficulty then increases when the average time between blocks is less than 10 minutes for a set time.

Surely the 10 btc in address 11111 that I'm describing "spending" twice, are the same coins but on different chains.
I'm hugely confused.
@_date: 2016-05-29 21:43:44
the address that you sent to (19nrc..) has not had any other inputs; i.e. it hasn't been used before.
where did you get that receiving address from?

it seems to constantly show issues regarding card verification.

that's not two transactions, that's one transaction and a change address.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:50:39
yes, you'll pay the usual transaction fee. You pay that every time you move btc from one address to another.

stop wasting addresses. Every time you generate a new one, that one less for everyone else.
Once they're all used up, we're blootered.
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:30:02
thank you, I think your answer provided a sort of epiphany moment. Coins on both chains - of course.

follow both, remain neutral, listen, learn.

What would be traded? The public addresses !!

localbitcoins takes every type of payment and you'll find someone that'll deal small amounts. There will be a mark-up though.

the cheapest way to get into mining would be to buy an asic on eBay (£20 -£40 / $30 - $60 depending on hash rate) and a Raspberry Pi.
Your chances of getting anything back at all are nil. If you join a pool, you won't even earn the minimum withdrawal amount, but you'll learn plenty and it won't cost you much.
with the money you save, buy some bitcoin and sit on them.
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:34:25
you really won't get any meaningful responses to your question - only you can answer it.
If, as you say, you love bitcoin and believe in it, hold. On the other hand, if you have doubts as to its future, dump and don't look back.
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:32:38
Here’s my view on what I think will happen if there is a fork.
Let’s say you have 2 bitcoins in your wallet and bitcoin is at $3,000 - you've got $6,000
if there is a split you will have have 2 coins on both chains but the price of coins on each chain will be different.
Even though you have 2 coins on both chains, if you spend a coin on one chain, you no longer have that coin on the other chain.
Suppose chain A coins are worth $1,000 and chain B coins are worth $2,000 - you've got 2X $1,000 + 2X $2,000 = $6,000 still
No one knows what will happen to the price of each chain, but it is likely one will gradually drop whilst the other rises.
If you do nothing and don’t move your coins on any chain, eventually the “winning” chain might be back up to $3000 per coin, whilst the other one will be worthless. You will be back to exactly where you were before the split.
If you did decide to sell one of your coins on the “losing” chain whilst it was priced at $1000 (remember, the price will be dropping, so getting a good price will be tricky), you would have one coin left on the other chain (valued at $2000) and $1000 in your bank. - You'll have $2,000 + $1,000 = $3,000    so don't sell until things settle down after the split.

go with localbitcoins. Safe, no bad reports so far. A bit scary but it just seems to work.
it does look like you'll pay a bit more than overseas but trying to get set up on MtGox or others is just a royal pain in t.a.  
quick nutshell of what to do
create an account and a wallet at blockchain.info
from this you'll have a "public" address, give this to the localbitcoin seller
he'll poke the coins into your blockchain wallet, job done
If you're going big time, read up on offline wallet, paper wallet or the like and create one of them. Then move the coins from your blockchain wallet to the offline one.
Enjoy the ride, we're all off to the moon apparently, T minus 10
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:33:25
check out localbitcoins.com  
find a seller with 100% positive feedback for "cash by post" sale in your currency and trust him.
I've yet to read about any scams involving a seller with excellent feedback - their reputation is too valuable to rip you off for 20 bucks.
alternative, if you're lucky, would be a bitcoin atm somewhere close by.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:22:44
I had the same issue, no idea why my account didn't include a fee, but after 3 days I got the following. I got the funds back.
Transaction Confirmation Failed
A transaction made through Blockchain.info has been removed from our database because it was taking a long time to be included in a block. 
Any funds have been returned to your wallet and you can now spend the coins again. Please consider including a larger fee in future transactions. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:14:11
Like OP, I also stayed up watching the ongoing battle.
What happened was someone wanted to dump thousands of bitcoin on an exchange. Everyone thought that as buyers dried up or shied away, the price would tank so much that people thought it was the end.
However, buys kept coming back. The more he sold, the more buyers bought. The price did drop, but it turned into a battle of who would die first – the bears, buying, or the whale, selling.
The bears won to great celebration.

I hope this gets picked up by the media to the same tune as the original story did. The visibility given to where donated money goes will make people open their eyes.

Just looked over the site. 
Must say, it looks really unprofessional, bad grammar etc. 
Personnally, not a chance of me using them.

as hotlogs says, localbitcoins is tried and tested and safe.
A bit scary at first, you transfer £x into some stranger's UK account and sit and wait.
then bingo, your coin(s) (or bits of coins) appear in your wallet.
Go for it, trust the force
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:03:18
the age old adage says, only go in with what you can afford to lose. If you lost the whole £1k, would you go hungry, homeless, lose your girlfriend etc or would you just be really miffed. If only miffed, go all in, otherwise go with what you're prepared to lose.
It's really hard at present to get £ back for btc, so assume you're in for the long haul.
And bittylicious is ludicrously overpriced at present, steer clear.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:41:38
Simple, safe, haven't seen or heard any "legitimate" bad reports
When you say no luck around you, they don't actually have to be local, unless you want to do a cash transaction. If you've got a bank account, a transfer to the dealer is all that's needed.
Scary but it works. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:32:40
try localbitcoins, worked many times for me and I'm yet to see a bad report/ experience from them. Many users here recommend them, especially UK users.
it's a bit scary sending funds from your bank account into a stranger's account,  but go with it, trust it, it works.
