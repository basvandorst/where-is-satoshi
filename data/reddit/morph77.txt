Not stupid, the guy just believes that laws and regulation do a good job in reducing money laundering.  He is suffering from constipation it seems when it comes to bitcoin regulation. "Let's just ban it." OK I agree he's stupid.

You have to pierce it with a pin to spend? :) [  Also from the FAQ: 
 Does this replace my existing Bitcoin wallet?
No, you still would need a third party wallet or the original Bitcoin Core P2P software to be able to move your funds in and out of the Opendime. Opendime works with any wallet that can sweep funds from the blockchain based on a WIF-format private key import. 
I don't get it I guess...

I get what you mean but on the other hand, it will take a very long time before Satoshis become scarce, you can basically get them for free these days.  If one bitcoin is not liquid because of the high value, you can just switch to Millibits.

That's also what I thought but on the other hand, that shit is a long time ago and the symbol is a good mix of 'S' and the lightning 'symbol'.

Don't forget there is a portion of spending that you can't live without.  Like food, housing or medical care.  
Those expenses will happen if you don't own anything else than Bitcoin.  This by itself is enough to drive the economy.  And if FIAT gets debased all the time, more and more people will own just bitcoin.  
Edit: clarity.

It's probably the most childish tweet ever from Roger Who.  Like banging somebody would make you not objective.

Taproot is a way to combine Schnorr signatures with MAST. The Schnorr signature can be used to spend the coin, but also a MAST tree can be revealed only when the user wants to use it. The schnorr signature can be any N-of-N or use any scriptless script contract. The consequence of taproot is a much larger anonymity set for interesting smart contracts, as any contract such as Lightning Network, CoinSwap, multisignature, etc would appear indistinguishable from regular single-signature on-chain transaction.

Yet another POW alternative.  Hashing power, nor software tweaks...  doesn't even compare.

Let's hope they take another 10 years for the follow up on the analysis and then 10 more for the application and approvals.
