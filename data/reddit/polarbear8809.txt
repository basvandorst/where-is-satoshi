A wise swimmer works with the wave not against the wave if he ever wants to go somewhere. 5 million bitcoiners out of 7 billion people in the world is like a drop in the ocean. Too weak to have any power. If we have 500 million bitcoiners, then we have a voice. If there are 5 bilion bitcoiners in the world, the world order is changed forever. Before reach there, we need to work with the wave and need as many ruling governments as possible on our side. Please have a long term vision.

Circle.com or Coinbase.com. I like Circle better because they don't charge any fee. Coinbase charge 1% fee to convert between $ and BTC.

1.This is not rumor central. 
2.You underestimate the Chinese' desire to convert their tightly controlled Renminbi into one of the openly traded currencies such as US dollar so they can protect their hard earned wealth overseas.  Bitcoin is the perfect solution.

In 2007, the top 10% wealthiest possessed 80% of all financial assets.[11] In 2007 the richest 1% of the American population owned 34.6% of the country's total wealth, and the next 19% owned 50.5%. Thus, the top 20% of Americans owned 85% of the country's wealth and the bottom 80% of the population owned 15%. 
Mark Zuckerberg is estimated worth 31.6 Billion. 
Why don't you think the 47 early adopters of bitcoin don't deserve 30% x 7B = only 2.1 B?

Sir, the better way to get some of your money back now is using  
It takes years by suing mtgox to get, if any, only pennies on the dollar back. Thinking about the sleepless nights you are going to spend waiting for the lawsuit to settle. If mtgox recovers, you can get all your money back and some. Killing your debtor is never a smart move.

There is a need for banks. That is why banks were created in the first place. A lot of people would rather trust a 3rd party to store valuables for them. We also have loan need. If we can integrate Bitcoin with banks and create a new breed of banks, that will be ideal.

Main stream prefers safety over privacy. Main stream rather trusts the 3rd party than themselves. That is why majority of people put their money in the bank even they have to provide photo id etc. Coinbase and Circle are tailored towards mainstream, namely, mom, papa and grandparents, etc. They are not trying to get technical nerds' business. They are not against privacy. They are not forcing you to open an account with them. They are just doing their part to spread the adoption of Bitcoin. If you don't agree with them, you don't have to use them. Trashing entities that are helping to expand the bitcoin ecosystems is really counterproductive.

This incident makes me think irreversible transactions do have certain disadvantages. If it is a fraudulent bank transfer, it can be reversed. Maybe we could improve the Bitcoin protocol and implement a recall option for super large transactions. Something like allowing recall within 6 confirmations and if the equivalent $ amount is greater than $1 mil.
