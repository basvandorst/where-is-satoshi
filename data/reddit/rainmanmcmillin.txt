Weird. Price went back up and GDAX then processed my order at the lowest spot in the hour :(

'Yall act like you've never seen a hard fork before...
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:47:40
Haha thanks
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:57:09
Same here. Sold at market to avoid a larger drop, and am watching it "pend" as the price drops. Fuck GDAX. I cannot imagine what will happen when/if a large portion of the market decides to sell.

Kit Kat in Portland takes Bitcoin.

Go to GDAX.
Buy "Ethereum."
Wait a year.

This is actually good for escalators.

Dear Coinbase, I wrote you, but you still ain't respondin'
I left my email, my 2FA and private key at the bottom
I sent two BTC back in autumn
You must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem with the network or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's the new coins, man?
How's about Golem?
My shitcoin's mooning too, I bought a Lambo, gold metallic
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Vitalik
I read about your Uncle Charlie too, that's shitty
I had a friend quit a job to shill his project via Twitter
I know you probably hear this every day
But my transaction has been stuck
I even got the Bitcoin Cash you had locked up
I got a wallet full of BTC locked up on your servers, man
I like the shit you told the IRS too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this ticket man, please respond
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Jihan

ETH trader, BTC agnostic.
The posts we had from April's run to $420 and this sub today are identical.
Happy Hodling, but enjoy the ride.

Holy fuck my neighbors heard me laugh at that.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:41:55
Loop a beat and hit the studio. Left you lyrics below.

Such underrated advice here. I'd add "take out your initial investment" but homeboy bought a tad high.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:29:32
"18? You sure?"
"Actually, 19. I think."
"You think?"
"Okay, more like...17, 16...okay, 15. Maybe even 14. I can't tell."
It's as if Bitcoin is on trial for statutory.

So we just need one more for a full dick n' balls cuisine?

Americans dealt with this feeling in November.

This has been the big debate among minors.
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:13:25
I shared it and got hours of downvotes, in other threads even.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:05:06
So they shorted your BCC at $800 so you can have it by the time it's worth ten cents.
Well played, Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:49:12
This is undoubtedly a pump and dump and/or manipulation. BTC has not lost value at the same rate as BCC has risen, by any stretch. New money coming in to a new coin, plus the fact that lots of folks got it free, but it's still rising, means red flags all over.
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:03:27
I have been getting downvoted to all hell for echoing this *rational* thought. We are mostly geeks and math kids. It's one thing to be jelly when an alt soars, but even ETH and NEO, which have been in the works for years, look like speed bumps compared to this pump. Even *if* the price holds at $1,000 I would be scared to have it. Lack of sells on the way up show mad manipulation. I just canceled my ideal BCC order at $250 and won't touch this thing again. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:59:51
12/20 confirmations for a BCC deposit to Bittrex that I sent last night. So that's one confirmation per hour. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:07:36
I live near Portland too. I'll pay $35 when John puts the ketchup on his wang.
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:46:22
Something something hard fork.
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:55:13
Good point. I was more poking fun at the idea that an altcoin with "cash" in the name will kill a legacy and all the "GAME OVER, MAN" fud.
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:20:39
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:21:26
Or are you asking me to break down how much the going rate is to watch a man eat his own dick? I'm hours from West Hollywood and can find out for ya.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:07:22
I'm at 12.
Started that 12 hours ago.

More like three scam artists calling everyone who has a 401K and convincing them to sell it for stock in Fidget Spinners.

Lots and lots of empty/spam tx going on right now. Coordinated attack.

It's an open-source decentralized network. You can throw an empty envelope with no stamp into the mailbox. Do this 1,000 times a day and it will slow down the mail. But, that's a federal crime. This is crypto.

That dream was about politics, not crypto.

Death Of Superman all over again.

Alts will drip back down and BTC will retest 6K in no time. 2X is the real bump in the road.
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:53:19
I sent the same (small) amount of BTC from a paper wallet to Bittrex, and a Coinbase wallet to Bittrex. 
One took 12 min to confirm all tx, one took about a day.
