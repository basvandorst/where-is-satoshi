I don't think that applies to a blockchain. 
Gambling is hoping that randomness lands in your favor.
Putting money in a volatile crypto like bitcoin is more akin to putting your money in gold or silver. However much more volatile. The underlying asset always has a use, therefore has some value. Never zero like gambling.
Cryptos by nature will always rise over time due to their finite nature and expanding use cases. That is what people do not get. 
The price is affected by CUV (current utility value) and DEUV (Discounted expected utility value).
CUV creates a baseline value. The price should not go under this. For example I can remit money across borders with bitcoin cheaper than a bank. That creates value. As use cases increase the CUV rises. (Insert many altcoins).
The problem is that we have monkey brains. So we add DEUV to the price. DEUV is speculation and it likes to create bubbles over the CUV line on a graph. Occaisionally the DEUV becomes too high and pops down to the CUV, which is happening now.
However we say buy the dip because cryptos always rise with expanding CUV. It is unfortunate when someone buys at the top of high % DEUV but if they wait, it *will* rise again.
Cryptos are an unstoppable force. Governments cannot stop them if they tried.

Tell me more about your knowledge of supply and demand WintendoU, teach me your vast wisdom.
I've clearly wasted my time on a troll who is willingfully ignorant of international finance. This is my fault.

These aren't theories. The US national debt surpassed 21 trillion in March. Is this not alarming to you? It is predicted to be 33 trillion by 2028.
It is not safe to believe China and other countries will keep buying US treasury bills when our debt to gdp is skyrocketing. In fact they have already begun to buy less.
No one wants a collapse. The Easiest solution is a gradual shift away from dollars. This will happen.

When the US national debt ratio becomes too high countries like China will buy far fewer treasury bills in bulk. Treasury bills have and still are seen as safe investments because the US is an economic power. But if debt becomes unreliable treasury bills are associated with higher risk. Higher risk means investors require higher interest rates. Higher interest rates means more expensive loans. More expensive loans means higher prices on everything.
Then you live in a van down by the river.

This is incorrect.
All those insane quotes you hear about btc being $500,000? When they go into detail it actually requires hyperinflation of USD. The purchasing power of 1 dollar decreases therefore the price of commodities increase. An apple will also be $25.
So that 500k actually only has todays purchasing power of lets say 100k. (arbitrary number.) 
If the dollar crashed I would predict btc to behave more like gold during the 2008 crash. It dropped about 30% over 1 year then recovered and then some afterward as people wanted a good place to park their money.
Take a look at the term capital flight. This would occur if USD destabilized. Super rich companies and foreign investment would run away, probably to China. I keep mentioning China for a reason.
I know your mind is in the right place. You're in right now. But I don't understand why you think USD is infallable. No economy has ever lasted forever. Just look at the numbers:  compare the debt ratio of the US to other countries. We have a debt as large as the entire EU -23 countries combined. A great depression is right around the corner if we stand around and do nothing like we are.
Satoshi Nakamoto recreated gold digitally. This will repair economies over time. I don't even care about the price of btc. After finance school and working in Japan, I decided banks ruined the world by eliminating gold standard and leverging unlimited using your social security dollars etc, so now I work in the crypto space instead. I want to help fix the world economy. This is the goal of crypto.
Anyway we should agree to disagree ��. I'm sure we've got work to do.

Read my comment again and actually click the link this time. The US economy is a ticking time bomb of unfunded liabilities. The Fed's solution? Print more money. How long until China doesn't give a shit about the fed? Everyone knows this except those in denial.
The blockchain is the only invention capable of saving financial markets that have shot themselves in the foot by loading trillions of debt on it.
Show me another invention that will fix the situation.
Price aside from stabalizing over time is irrelevant so I didn't even mention that. Time is the only factor to inevitable adoption of blockchain based currencies and assets. This is clear to those who hold BTC or other cryptos. It is volatile short term (1-20 years.) because the tech is still in development. But it will be intrinsically linked to finance and business in the next 20 years and honestly that's speaking pessimistically.
If the dollar implodes (as most economists worth a damn predict that) then sure everything will crash. But the dollar will not rise from that event. Blockchain will.

The dollar will plummet. The federal reserve will no longer be trusted. The US economy will be in peril. This will happen in our lifetime.
That is what my Finance professor told us on our first day. "Good luck fixing that, I'm retiring next year." - His next sentence.
His words will resound in my head until the day I die. The benefits of decentralization will be shown after this inevitable collapse. 
Cryptocurrency adoption rate is still increasing exponentially. People didn't even know what bitcoin was or had completely forgotten about it this time last year.
Once adoption is sufficiently saturated, prices of crypto like bitcoin will become "stable" from the invisible hand and other market forces when applied to billions of transactions. Right now scalability is the primary limiting factor to everything you just mentioned.
Once the scaling issue is resolved and it will be, businesses will not only be able to instantly receive crypto as payment, but they will prefer it as it comes with fewer fees, it's faster, trustless (no bank), and may run dapps or smart contracts within the currency network itself. If they want to, they will be able to settle the payment into cash within seconds as well.
Screw the "crazy gains," there is an invention called blockchain that will illeviate the strain on the economy the banks have created. Unlimited debt is not possible.
Blockchain is here to save us. Stop believing in the banks. They fucked us.

Ask yourself this: If people stop using dollars what will they use? A crypto. Whether thats btc or another who cares.
Also the node issue would be solved by scaling development as I mentioned earlier. The code itself will be light and elegant and nodes for crypto will be ubiquitous.
I would imagine there will be a chip built right into your phone, fridge, microwave, tv etc. Everything will be a node in 20 years. The need for heavy duty graphics cards will dissipate.

Risk is everything. Yes it does. :)
Also. Bitcoin is not something that can be "toppled." It is forever barring EMP bombs or intense worldwide solar flares.
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:27:13
Untrue. BTC is valued in many currencies. It was valued in JPY when I lived in Japan. Or conversely perhaps the currencies are valued in BTC. jk
It is all belief. The thing is dollars require more and more belief over time whereas btc is an immutable distributed ledger that we can all trust. It requires less and less belief over time. 
Blockchains cannot be destroyed. Dollars can be.
