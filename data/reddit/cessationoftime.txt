A merchant that you spend your coins at will likely be able to identify when you spend other coins at another merchant that they are familiar with. This means merchants in the same town will likely know when a customer visits their competitor if that competitor reuses addresses.  This is a very specific situation, but also probably more common than mining bitcoins yourself.
@_date: 2014-09-19 21:05:24
This would still be tough/risky as you'd have to find sufficient willing participants and have the capital to buy them out.  A true villain would just off masternode operators and build nodes themself.  Though you'd still have to identify operators AND gain access to their servers to take them offline as they could be running in someone else's datacenter.
@_date: 2014-08-28 01:11:09
This wouldn't slow bitcoin transaction speed though, it would just make bitcoin more susceptible to a 51% attack.  It would also lower the hashing power and mining difficulty.

The problem with the idea of it being a scam. Is what would a non-scam look-like?  How would you tell the difference?  Have they done something specific to make you think it is a scam, or is it a gut feeling?  Personally I think this is a genuine effort, and that they believe in the concept as much as we do, I just dont know if they can deliver or not. But I bet they dont know if they can deliver or not either, usually you dont know that when you start a business, you just give it a best effort.

Yes, they've been trying to do this for awhile.  But were waiting on their legal team.  They have quite a few legal documents if you look through their website.  They are just being thorough. People are asking to purchase the ethereum, it isn't any more or less a scam just because people bought a lot of it.
@_date: 2014-07-27 00:45:10
That's not what I'm saying at all. The beginnings of bitcoin were risky just like investing in a company or ethereum would be.
@_date: 2014-07-26 20:37:04
This is a strange thing for someone to say in "Think about it...those bitcoiners are literally just giving someone their dollars and taking shit in return in hopes it will make them rich"  
If you cant compare the beginnings of bitcoin to an IPO what can you compare it to?

Ha, if you could do "proof of walk" in a verifiable manner then that would be a very decentralized mining setup.
@_date: 2016-03-07 03:46:40
One justification is that in Bitcoin we spend all of our time squabbling over improvements to allow us to scale, all of our development is invested into that goal.  Many of the altcoins have solved that problem and moved on to more exciting things.  And those new features are things that people in the banking sector (R3 for example, which represents 43 major banks) are very excited about.  If big money starts adopting alt-coins instead of bitcoin it could mean bitcoin losing the race.
Another is that many of the features that made bitcoin exciting in the first place are mostly extinct because of high fees.  The idea of micro-payments for the web and low fees that would allow bitcoin to be used as currency in countries with an unstable national currency or poor people without banking infrastructure.
The hope now seems to be that bitcoin can act as bank settlement layer or be used as a store of value in a similar fashion to gold.  But the bank's don't appear to be excited about bitcoin and are choosing to involve themselves in other things. 
Which leaves store of value, and that simply isn't enough.  The store of value for bitcoin won't hold when people see other cryptos rising, gaining traction with the finanacial industry, maintaining low fees and allowing for micro-payments.
If the value falls the miners will start to bail. And when that happens transaction throughput will temporarily drop, making the current bottleneck transaction worse until the difficulty readjusts. And the difficulty readjustment takes longer if the block throughput is down.
Bitcoin has just become too risky and it's competition too far ahead.  Some people see where things are headed and they want to get there first.  So the alt-coins are going up and have been for 3 months now.
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:57:17
The bandwidth required for a full block with 2MB+SW = 2MB.  And it's the bandwidth that matters to the miners behind the great firewall of china. They cannot connect to the rest of the network with more than dial-up speeds.  Bandwidth is the limiting factor rather than the number of transactions within a single block.

@_date: 2017-03-24 21:48:23
Exactly, as people and companies are forced to pull out of the bitcoin space transaction volume will drop and bitcoin will be more secure because it will be more costly to spam the network.  And that additional security will make bitcoin more valuable.  Which is why we're now approaching $950!

I'm pretty sure that if it never gets confirmed your coins were never sent and you still possess them.  So basicly you can double-spend them and the second transaction will succeed if the first did not.

Then every hard fork is an altcoin? That isn't the definition of altcoin. An altcoin is started by creating a new unforked blockchain where your existing coins do not live.  So whether it intentionally forks or not, calling it an altcoin is dumb.

When it comes to governments banning bitcoin, Bitcoin becomes a bit like the prisoner's dilemma. The one that breaks the agreement to ban it is going to gain an economic advantage. The same is true of banks, the one that uses bitcoin will gain an economic advantage over its competitors.  They are just too greedy to all agree to it and they seem to realize this and are not banning it for fear of others adopting it and competing against them with its advantages.

@_date: 2013-04-09 23:24:40
And when that happens all the Bitcoin miners will have to patch their Bitcoin software?  I think improvements are more likely to be incremental ones on the current system than competitive.  Even if someone was to work on their own branch of Bitcoin, and it existed as a separate currency for a time, if their modifications proved valuable they would probably be integrated into the current system in time.
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:25:19
Yes, There would be two separate but identical blockchains initially and then they would begin to diverge.  But if you only have a handful of miners supporting the new blockchain it isn't going to amount to much because it will be extremely vulnerable to a 51% attack. While the mainline blockchain would remain unaffected by an attack on the new forked blockchain.
@_date: 2013-03-30 17:09:17
But if services, such as fast-food places, start accepting bitcoin. Even if they do convert it directly to USD, pretty soon people will view it as "real money".  This is just a stepping stone to that end.

@_date: 2013-04-11 22:20:48
Ah, but that's not really my fault.  My employer pays in dollars, and all the merchants still peg their bitcoins to the exchange rate.  Until bitcoins are used to pay employees and are used to set prices. I do not have a way to become fully part of the bitcoin economy even if I want to.  Also, I'm not so worried about the price itself as I am how many bitcoins I have, or can get ahold of.

The biggest problem with Fiat is the infationary system, perhaps it stimulates the economy, but at the expense of all the things that really matter. It makes people more likely to buy things they dont really need instead of fixing/reusing things they already have.  And then other people waste their time and energy making things that aren't really needed. It just induces a big system of waste.  I dont want to be richer in material wealth I would like to be richer in free time to do my own thing and this system is designed to prevent freedom/free-time, and the ability to save and not waste.
@_date: 2013-04-05 22:41:10
I agree. It's also not as disruptive as people make out.  All they have to do is move taxes from income to goods and to utilities in particular. The biggest disruption I see is it forces the hidden tax that is inflation out into the open.  It's certainly going to upset banks, and the status quo, but all this about wiping out the government, or even greatly shrinking it is just silly.  It will simply reorganize itself.
