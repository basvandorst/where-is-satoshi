Change passwords elsewhere I'm guessing since either they stored the passwords in plaintext or only md5'd them.
You'll start to see people saying that they have been hacked shortly due to the same password use cross-site.

From the looks of the app (and this is in no way trying to belittle it), I would have thought they would have given you the old "not enough functionality" rejection response.
I got this recently on an app I was developing. The thing is that the app did what it needed to do (I still use v1.0 today, while developing 1.1 with extra added bells and whistles to make the user feel like they are using a POS app). The interface was simple and easy to use. It did the job that it was to do, and if I actually added any more functionality it would have destroyed the primary goal of the app.
Good to see you get something through though.

Have him get a wallet then have AP post the address. Give as much or as little to him as you feel. Share the love, show that Bitcoin is more than what it is.
If D wants to cash out right away so be it, if he wants to ride the train that we've been riding, then that's his choice. In the end we are all winners with the exposure.
I feel bad for what he has gone through and would happily  give him something.

Wouldn't be a first time that a cat was running around with a USB :P

Seriously? I was about 70% done with my app :/ (second app that has been pulled before seeing the light of day, at least I can use it on my own phone).
