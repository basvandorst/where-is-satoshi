Because it is drilled into people's heads that the artist IS NOT who owns the content.  The general public is taught that it is some giant corporation- the same corporation who puts up 10000 barriers to access the content so as to maximize how much they exploit the end user for while low-balling the creator until they are making next to nothing.
I can only hope one day the content creator will also be the owner and the seller of that which they create.  Till then, it is just whole bunch of people getting fucked over by the gorilla in the middle.
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:36:15
Sorry to say, but that model is broken and dated.  It limits access to content that would otherwise be available AND PURCHASED if the system was modernized. These rogue entities are proof that things need to be fixed.  The current corporate structure for delivering content is terrible- people actually HATE IT.  
Eventually, it will change but it is going to be painful for the folks who hitched their wagon to that broken system. Folks like yourself are going to be the casualties unless one of these corporate behemoths can come up with a delivery system that works.

@_date: 2014-06-27 15:06:23
It seems this is so easy to game if you are a big player.  The best way to play is to have multiple bids within $100 of each other.  Start at $999 and work your way down to the real price say $599.  If your bid wins at unrealistic levels, you forfeit your $200,000 and pass it on to the next bidder.  Then you wait to see if your $899 bid holds, if it does, you pass on it and lose another $200K, but lets say your $799 bid does not get a shot- you then know the selling price was somewhat South of $899 and North $799.
You could leverage this information to use the $30,000,000 you had earmarked for the auction (remember your first bid was $1000 per BTC) and play the market for bigger gains than you might of received had you fulfilled your obligation to buy.  In my scenario this "selling price information" only cost $400,000. I have to imagine knowledge of the real price would be worth much more.

I'm guessing, but it sounds as if you can hand it to a participating merchant who accepts BitCoin, swipe just like a credit card and it will deducted from your wallet automatically.  This will really boost the convenience of using the currency.

OP was not the target of scam- this is a repost from r/justiceporn.
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:58:33
I think they can- this is what I found on the USMS site...


I'd lose my $200K deposit but no more.  So, in the grand scheme of things, if I bid $1000 a coin, and the current price was $588 at the end of the auction, my $200K loss would be chump change compared to what would lose if I followed through on my bid.
It just seems to me, the winning bid price is going to fall within tolerances of where bitcoin's price is at the close of the auction give or take $200,000...  unless I am missing something (and that could certainly be the case)
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:23:36
So is there any scenario where this auction drives "up" the price?

Dude- the fun of living can be found, somewhat, in the risks we take...
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:30:09
Do you think this because the bitcoin landscape looked rosier at the time of their initial bid or because of some other strategy (admittedly, I am bitcoin retarded but trying to learn)
@_date: 2014-11-15 16:32:14
Dream big.

@_date: 2014-06-27 13:37:17
There is one thing I am not getting, it seems to me that these coins will go to the bidder who has most closely bid to the real time bitcoin price when the auction is over.  In other words, if I bid $800 a coin and the price was at $585 when the auction was over, I would just pass on my bid and the justice department would go to the next bidder in line.  This would continue till it hit the person who bid closest to the current asking price. 
I think... granted I have read this entire thread and understand about 15% of it.
@_date: 2014-08-28 13:38:33

You're right,  I am probably an outlier.  Not too many of my crypto friends are on reddit with any regularity.  There is no way in hell I am going to post anything showing my stake because that is retarded. 
I still have a large stake and it is always interesting to see where mind sets are at. I migrated to reddit when digg became a shit hole so joining the crypto subs was just natural because I was interested.
The big bitch was when people started shorting it.  You'd be surprise at what the upper echelon does not know about.  That particular development took me and my coins by surprise.  There are a few of us old timers that circle around but mostly we talk about the next big thing.  At this point, none of it much matters.  Now it is all a "long haul" situation.  The easy, lucky money has already been made.  I think folks like me are watching for adoption and seeing some funnel that really allows you to spend crypto like a credit card.

I guess you could say, there is absolutely nothing for me to gain from it except placing a target on my head.  
Hell, even I could start drilling down from a user name and put pieces together.  You get to a point in your life when it is not important what you have but what you do for others and there is absolutely no sense bragging about good fortunes. You'll only end up "getting what you deserved" if someone managed to crack into your holdings.  People would point to the fact that you advertised it and you got what was coming to you for putting it out there in the first place.
If you ever hit it big, you will understand there is nothing to gain from bragging it. I prefer to wear my usual clothes, drive around in my old but pretty cool truck and enjoy the fact I can live on both coasts.  
Sure, I could show you pics of my Goldman Sachs account with a bunch of black lines that may or may not keep prying eyes out or pics of my surroundings, cars, boat and 4 wheelers but it is better to keep others guessing instead of affirming there is a reason to try and bust my nut.
Because maybe I am sitting in a homeless shelter, on my cot, by a bridge in NYC wishing for what might of been if I had used the extra hundred from my social security check to buy some btc when it was at a nickel.
Or maybe, I had just sold a business for $15 mil before I turned 35 and spending $100 on that particular day was like getting a couple of neat looking candies from a cool looking vending machine...

The article is a year old but is there any truth to it?
@_date: 2018-06-16 00:15:03
I wish (sort of).  I got some left but I didn't start thinking about my BTC until the price got around $200.  Then the Mt. Gox stuff happened and I started trying to understand what paper keys meant and what I had.  From my chair, at that time, I was not even sure the stuff was real, how to unload it or how exactly the keys worked.  Then I hooked up with a guy involved in cool project and he was buying crypto like it was a religion (LTC &amp; Doge).  So I started messing around with it as well. 
My big moment was when ETH came out and my brain decided that all BTC would be spent via some magical ethereum network and decided that I would sell a good chunk of btc and get this juicy ETH at $29.  
And that is my journey.  I had already sold a business and had multiple projects going on so the bottom line was not my upper concern.  I've had a lot of fun with crypto. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 14:25:11

Read this [article]( and look at what occurred one year ago to Ether. It is an interesting read.  My gut feeling is, no matter what, you will see a down turn, a mini crash if you will because that is the nature of crypto. You could put in a buy order at insanely lower price and you might hit it and get some otherwise cheaper ether then scale it up with other buy orders till you get the amount you want.
edit: and learn about [Tezos]( (I'm not recommending you buy it when it becomes available, but you should understand what it is and what it possible can do- and be sure to take note of the money recently raised...)

Pretty simple- No one has built a system to use gold as a currency in a modern digital format. At least, I do not know of one. 
Now, to your point of main stream adoption- I could see the volatile nature of btc (right now) being an issue- "I sold my inventory of bread yesterday for .03 btc, value dropped 50% over night, now I do not have enough btc to replenish my inventory..." but so far, my experience of using it has been rather easy.

Ut oh, you're going off the rails again. Lets break things down so I can understand your position- are you saying that China does not use surveillance? If so, let me know and I'll hook in some credible links (I just assumed you accepted this as fact.)
You are beginning to contradict yourself. At first, you stated China was only a threat to its own citizens but now you are stating "China does some economic espionage". Based on this statement, can I assume you recognize China's cyber army is a global threat?
@_date: 2013-12-31 19:09:14
Wait, let's back up. In order to establish if discussing this with you is worth the time, I need you agree with the following statements.
A.China exploits it's citizens using me most sophisticated surveillance system in the world.
B. China goes to great lengths to build its cyber army.
@_date: 2013-12-31 14:03:48
In all seriousness, what does it matter? If you think for one second China, with the world's most powerful cyber army, doesn't have all the tools the NSA does, you are a fool. They, in essence, will know more about every aspect of society and government than the data banks of every free world country combined. And if they were caught with this data, they would give two fucks less and march forward gaining more power and more knowledge.  Since we've elected to selectively bitch about who sees what instead protesting about the act itself, we have allowed the real tyrant of data harvesting to become an unstoppable juggernaut.
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:33:33

So, before we go any further, can we agree that China spies on other countries and does much more than surveillance?

Depends how big the bubble is going to get...

I went with Coinbase, they wanna get pretty deep. I've made it to the screen where they want me to give them my banking information... If they have this level of info on me, I'm wondering what the benefits of bitcoin are when folks like the NSA have shown they can scrape anything they want...

Yes, we're all waiting to hear which group of devices lies in between your "some" and my "all".

Yup- what he said.  Took me two weeks to become convinced of this though.

Thanks for the link- I do think displaying the current price on the app logo would be a cool addition

I've been wanting to buy some bitcoin since 2010. Back then, the biggest hurdle was figuring out where to buy them, how to buy and if I was getting ripped off and setting myself up for a bigger rip off by providing my payment information.  I had an unfounded suspicion that Bitcoin was run by the Bank of 4chan. The price never dissuaded me, the stories the media feed me did. So, I have to ask, if I wanted some bitcoin where would you suggest I start?

What do you think will happen when they enter the picture?

New docs show ~~iPhones~~ all phones are completely rooted by NSA.

Why would you believe China only spies on its own citizens?
