The panic part, I get. But I'd expect the panic to be about RMB, not about BTC.

Well, 'digital goods' are pretty big nowadays. That also includes plane tickets, or stuff like VPN and web hosting (very nice to do that anonymously when you're in China), software licenses (oh well, OK, people don't buy software licenses in China :)) etc.
Furthermore, nothing prevents people within China to accept eachothers bitcoins as payments. It's only the exchange to and from RMB they can restrict (and not even all of it, no stopping localbitcoins.com for example). Chinese users could buy and sell *anything* from eachother on eBay or other trading platforms. 
As for the import of tangible goods, if restrictions and major taxes are a problem, then the same goes for buying those with RMB so that's not a disadvantage for Bitcoin, but for China in general.

How would such a node get different **valid** versions of the blockchain, without re-mining all the involved blocks?
Different version means other transactions, means other block hashes, and someone can't just forge those.

Don't make it too technical. You will scare off 99.9% of the Average Joes if you start talking about cryptography, private keys, peer to peer, etc. 
 
Also, I always encounter a lot of nonsense of how Bitcoin is not real, it's virtual, it's digital. Please emphasize that dollars in your bank are exactly as virtual. It's just some random number in their administration, representing your balance, but the dollars don't exist. It's nowhere. They ain't got your money in a safe, they ain't got a stack of gold, there is no actual "backing" whatsoever. It's NOTHING. **The money simply doesn't exist, it's all pure fiction!** 
 
Not saying this is necessarily wrong, but it can by no means be an argument pro dollars/banks and against Bitcoin.

LOL :D
But seriously, Amir, would you consider it calling "Open Market" or "Free Market" or something like that, to emphasize not just the "Dark" side of it (as in CP, hitmen, etc) but also the Open and Free aspect (as in, no longer regulated by random governments or banks deciding whatever the fuck I wish to buy or sell).

1. You shouldn't be doing that in the first place! (Why would you?!) 
 
2. Assuming they run a legit service, they shouldn't care if you leave bitcoins with them or not.

Crazy for the half still remaining in fiat crap, you mean?
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:09:34
1. Sorry, trying to understand here. I realize China's govt is way more restrictive than most western countries. But if nobody is buying from the govt, and only selling to eachother for a fraction of the price the govt is charging, how do they prevent that?
2. Sure, but you can't say "not be able to use BTC in China". You can still use them for *everything* you could before, except selling them for RMB through exchanges (notwithstanding that alternatives like localbitcoins.com would still perfectly be possible in China).
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:55:20
1. How would they cause the RMB to go up? If everybody would be dumping RMB for $0.000001 like there's no tomorrow, then *by definition* the exchange rate has crashed. What would they plan to do about that?
2. What do you mean, "not be able to use BTC in China". You're perfectly able to use BTC in China. No problem or restrictions whatsoever. You're just unable to buy more BTC with your RMB, because they're restricting the exchange's bank accounts.

And besides, nobody ever considers fiat money a risk. But this system is fundamentally broken, and doomed to collapse. People should also consider how much risk there is in putting their savings in USD. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 11:16:16
How about "Open Market" then?
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:33:20
Agree, but it *does* make sense taking your buy/sell signals from what you estimate a huge mass of utterly clueless fucktards will do, when FUD like this appears on reddit etc :(
@_date: 2014-05-22 08:32:50
Amen to that, brother. I'm with ya. It's been enough. Time for plan ฿!
@_date: 2014-04-25 11:40:31
Yeah, you know that, I know that, Amir certainly knows that.
The big mass audience doesn't. And the mass media where they get their info from *surely* don't know it.
@_date: 2014-04-25 11:14:27
Fully agree. "Free" has a much better vibe to it than "Dark". 
 
Maybe even "Open Market". 
@_date: 2014-04-25 10:42:41
Excellent proposal. I agree. 1 Bitcoin = 1 million bits. And this makes a satoshi a "bitcent" :)
I will use the "bit" unit as much as possible from now on! 
Should we also introduce a specific symbol this denomination? Like ƀ (U+0180, the lowercase version of Ƀ) or ⓑ (U+24D1) or ␢ (U+2422) ?
@_date: 2014-04-25 11:17:59
Or "uBay" (like.. "eBay" but powered by "you")
Or Open Market
@_date: 2014-05-22 08:46:27
You're taking a lot of risk there man. That fiat crap can crash any moment. And I wouldn't be too sure about the silver either.

Kudos, sir! * takes hat off and bows * 
 
Can you post a donation address somewhere, for people who wish to express their appreciation for your contribution to Bitcoin in money? (since you can't post addresses here, perhaps a onename.io link?)

I've got almost nothing but good experience with Bitstamp. Occasionally I've experienced a short delay in withdrawals or deposits (both with fiat and bitcoins) but in general it works fine. 
 
Nonetheless I would recommend Kraken instead. Bitstamp is getting too big imho, diversity is better, and also more in line with the Bitcoin philosophy. And although my personal experience with Bitstamp has been fine, I have to say Kraken has been even better. Very fast processing, easy to use, altogether it just works *great*. 
 
I also favor Kraken's cryptographic proof of solvability that they have published recently. 
 
Lastly, Kraken has lower fees. Bitstamp's fee can be just as low, but only if your trade very large volumes.

What will you do if USD crashes again?
@_date: 2014-05-22 08:45:07
Logical fallacy. Would you consider "under 9" young, and if yes, would that imply that "over 9" is old? :)
