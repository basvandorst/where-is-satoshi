Ok, I'm pro bitcoin cash, but even I lol'd

Why did I laugh? I guess because of the hostility between the two camps.
 I saw this picture of the clue yesterday and of course I knew it was bitcoin. I think the way the comic played of what I had preconceived as the answer and flipped it around was funny.

Oh, sorry, I didn't see this til just now. 
I'm pro BTC because they have a product that works, today.
I did hold bitcoin for a little bit, but one fees got so high, it was a joke to even consider using it. 
I truly see bitcoin as digital gold, not digital cash. With bitcoin, I could buy a car. who gives a fuck it the transaction takes a long time? with a purchase like that I've got time. If I wanna but some coffee? nah, Bitcoin cash is a better option.
that said, I'm not much in either, I'm all about feeless now.

This, I'd give anything to payoff all my debt (even money! haha). If I could just live and work and never have to worry about my next paycheck, it would be totally worth it!

I've never had this happen to me, but I'd start seriously crunching numbers.
First off, I'd figure out what I need to buy all the things that I want. So, you want that house? I wouldn't even take out enough Coin for that, maybe half. Then what toys do you want? Is your car run down? Well, you can now afford a nice (albiet cheap) car. I'm talking like honda or some shit.
figure out what all that stuff is going to cost, and liquidate that. but don't forget your taxes too.
Only tell the wife about that, and maybe throw her a bone too. a thousand or so USD. 
My logic is you get to have all the things you want, your comfort goes up substantially, but you still have a mortgage and still NEED to work. you and your wife can't just quit your job because, well now you owe the bank money. But even living paycheck to paycheck, you will still be able to sleep well at night knowing you have a cushion. 
Ok, now here's the kicker. you got yourself set up. you're living real comfy, right? I would liquidate a little more and invest that elsewhere. Stocks? real estate? whatever. It's always a good idea to diversify.
And in the end, never look to that money. Hodl like a mofo. It's never your "rainy day fund" because that means you're going to spend it eventually.

MAn, bag holding fiat. never thought I'd consider such a thing.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:22:37
Surprise, surprise.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:13:11
Ok, serious question. What's the likelihood that bitcoin will ever reach that price?
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:47:17
Nice! thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:20:26
which wallet do you use? 
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:07:27


you mean ETFs, right?
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:27:55
Thank you much!

How does increasing block size centralize it? Genuine question cause I don't know the answer.
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:53:27
Nice, thanks for the info!
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:44:41
thanks for the response! so 24*6*8=1152, and 24*6*1=114. 
Why can't I mine more bitcoin transactions to meet the bitcoin cash size?
Again, I'm just trying to understand. Because if there are hardware limits, it seems like bitcoin cash comes out ahead simply in ability to MAKE transactions. It seems like what you're saying is that bitcoin will have a hard time keeping up if it actually becomes adopted as a global currency by layfolk. 
Again, I'm not trolling, just trying to understand. 
thanks so much!

So you mine on a laptop? Or just hold the ledger? Are you able to make any money on a laptop?
Thanks
