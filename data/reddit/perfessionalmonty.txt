most if not all cities around the world are going to have bitcoin exchanges. Cash works but getting even small amounts to family out of country or transferring to others out of country without raising flags. Plus most immigrants don't have bank accounts in the country of origin and now as more people immigrate with the new age they can easily find out about bitcoin and how to use it to benefit themselves. 
I know it will never be truly adopted but people are treating it like gold so idk.

Very true. But demand isn't waning. As it progresses and becomes more adopted.... blah blah blah. It will still be the currency of a good amount of off book transactions so it will always be around. 
The real question is, when banks start using a blockchain type thing to transfer money will bitcoin become obsolete?

It will never hit zero... supply and demand. As time goes on it will be more difficult/expensive to mine. Plus there is a limited amount like come on.
