I tried finding another source for it before posting that roger ver site, but no luck ;(. It's not a phishing site though lol.

I'm actually looking for a charity to support this holiday season. Your story has brought a smile to my day. I am would like to offer your organization 1,000,000 views for free (from the crypto space). Please message me if you'd like to begin talking strategy Mr Pineapple Fund!

As far as I know, it only goes above 1MB when there's enough transactions to push it past then so people don't have to compete with setting higher fees, the 8MB is a capacity ceiling. Anyone can feel free to correct me on that though ^^.

XRP does not require trust, and has no counterparty risk, that's the whole point of it and the issue it is trying to solve.
Ripple is NOT centralized, it is actually one of the most decentrlized networks with over 200 validating nodes that you can choose to trust.
The issuing of XRP IS centralized, which is what most people get 'Ripple is centralized from'. Ripple labs owns just over 60% of XRP. While most people see this as a bad / greedy thing, this also means that they have the most incentive to see it appreciate. A ripple employee on XRPchat.com said that they make more from the appreciation of XRP by 1 cent, than they do from signing up 200 banks. There is clear incentive for them to be pushing XRP as much as they have been recently, and I'm banking on it.
As disclosure, I'm one of the early adopters, and invested in them before they hit a cent (and haven't sold any).
Edit: found the post from the ripple employee-
Let me know if you have any other questions.

What website is this?
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:58:44
what is the block size drama then
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:24:32
So the storage becomes unmanageable quicker with bigger blocks, even if the blocks aren't as full. E.g a 8MB capacity block with only 34KB of transactions vs a 1MB capacity block with only 34KB of transactions in the block - would this be equivalent in terms of creating a bigger chain or not? If it is equivalent, then that isn't an argument unless 8MB blocks somehow generate 8x more transactions as well. 
Thanks for the response.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:36:07
They aren't though, also that block is from July. You might be thinking of segwit2x which is a proposal set to attempt to fork the chain in november. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:13:48
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:53:03
So throughput should about double, if blocksizes are doubled, or is the majority of the new space being used for signatures, like you said?
Also, is segwit constructed any differently than bch in terms of reducing impact on chain length, or is that always going to be dependeng on how many transactions are processed on the network?
Thanks again for taking your time to clear this up, it's really hard to get accurate and organized information on this.

My portfolio is Bitcoin and Ripple because I think they're the furthest thing away from eachother, and both have a place in the crypto revolution. 
I picked Ripple specifically because they are going for regulatory capture, which others are not. The regulators aren't going to stay quiet forever, and I think they'll be the ones that can best reconcile the regulators with the blockchain.
Additionally, they are going after a trillion dollar business where they have 0 competition. Ripple, the platform has some competition, though years ahead. XRP, their token has no competition, and the possibilitiy of another settlement token appearing is very slim. They are the only ones that have a liquid settlement token (banks can sell it on the market after settling a payment with it). Banks that choose not the use XRP will have to rely on IOU's, which means that there is no trustless settlement, and they'll still have billions of capital trapped in nostro accounts, making it a very inefficient solution. 
I don't think I have to justify investing in Bitcoin, but they were the first, and they are the only ones robust enough in the current climate to be considered a store of value.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:59:47
it's about 1/8 of what it was in the past 12hours, than in the past 2 days. Still highish, but will probably fall once the mempool clears up with the increased throughput.
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:32:35
What do you dislike about ripple? I'm an investor and can answer any questions about it if you'd like.
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:44:54
Can you explain what  you mean by that?
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:53:48
Yeah, I understand that argument too, but a short-term scaling solution would definitely help bitcoin maintain its steam. A few dollars in transaction fees are pretty offputting for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.

There are no new XRP coins being issued, it is hard capped at 100 billion coins. Currently 38 Billion are in circulating supply, while 62 billion are owned by Ripple labs.
Ripple can sell it however they want, but they've discussed selling XRP to banks in lockups deals to create a stable market (E.g Ripple sells XRP to bank of America and says they can't sell it on open market for 2 years).
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:05:44
what's the difference between this increase in block size and the alt chain?
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:09:30
So what's the difference between the block size increase in bch, versus the blocksize increase via segwit? I thought bigger blocks reduced scalability due to making the chain longer. I was under the impression segwit was to free up half the blockspace via removing signature data to make more room for transactions.
Thanks for explaining btw.
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:00:34
I have also wondered this too, it seems to solve the storage issue, but maybe untransacted bitcoin during the timeframe would be affected unless balances are stored separately?
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:31:29
Blocks are staying under 1MB, each block can hold double the transactions though.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:17:42
I don't unfortuntely, I'm not a techy person :(. If you make a thread over at xrpchat.com I'm sure one of the regulars will be happy to help you!
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:42:47
The most recent protocol chance was to implement segwit, not to increase blocksize.
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:43:01
Thanks for explaining this, so block size is increasing, but via block weight rather than in general, which helps compress signature data to make transaction throughput more efficient? 
How many transactions per block can we expect, and is there any miner incentive not to fill up blocks to its maximum? I just saw antpool mine one with 1 transaction and thought that somewhat malicious.
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:57:13
Thank you for the response, so the argument you're outlining is that because bitcoin would have more throughput, people would use it more often?
Is this bad because of the storage implications with having to store all of those transactions due to PoW? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:18:47
Huh, are you talking about BTC/USD(or USDT) or other pairs? Polo hasn't passed 9.9k yet.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:22:06
There aren't any - they have the proper licensing to allow consumers to do so.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:17:17
How much small is the transaction using Schnoor sigs? Wondering what the short-term affect on throughput will be.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:16:06
No, they are an acting party just like the people who support core. Hypothetically, if core were to go rogue we'd need these type or other parties to steer us in the right direction. 
Their hardfork failed, and their businesses lost a lot of community support over it. They took the risk, and while this time, to this community it was subjectively a bad risk, the next time it could be a good one. If you don't like their intentions, you can hate them for it, but we shouldn't shun the efforts of third parties to influence bitcoin - we want an ecosystem where change away from authority is possible. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:11:49
As Darxe said, you would have to declare it as capital gains. If it's a significant chunk, I would recommend seeing an accountant to see the best way to have it taxed because in some countries long-term holdings and short-term holdings are taxed differently (if you hold for a certain amount of time, taxes would be reduced). 
@_date: 2017-09-01 00:55:22
I was responding to the part where he inquired about counter-party trust. The user thought you had to trust the party you were sending XRP to but you don't.
There's plenty of nodes you can choose to perform your transaction, including ones hosted by ripple labs, microsoft, an average internet user, and a host of many others. They are the equivalent of a 'miner' for bitcoin, with the caveat that big names risk being sued if they try gaming the system, as opposed to the faultless miners in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:14:44
I'm a supporter of increased blocksize because I'm a business owner and the bitcoin fees will be much more manageable. I'd prefer it happened on the legacy chain so that we stay united, and I hope we're able to do that. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:48:14
Like most merchants, they can use a liquidity provider like bitpay/bitcoinpay to assume volatility risk, which would also effectively obfuscate their bitcoin transaction history since it's 1 address / payment and then they can be paid out via bank transfer.

Seems his developer did it without telling anyone. Ice Poseidon is somewhat accountable for trusting that developer, but at the same time is a victim as well from his developer pulling this one on his fans.
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:17:55
I don't, sorry. There's probably a lot of good reasons to invest in eth, but its inflationary nature makes it a poor store of value so I don't feel as safe holding it compared to bitcoin/ripple. They are definitely leading in innovation with an army of developers on their platform, so we'll see what happens!
@_date: 2017-10-06 08:18:44
This seems like propoganda against segwit2x. Plenty of reasons to dislike segwit2x but this isn't one of them.
