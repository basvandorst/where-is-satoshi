1,527,600 outstanding shares as of 31st of march 2016. So that's 145,258 BTC at 0.09508931 BTC a share (started at 0.1 BTC but Grayscale takes out a 2% fee each year).

I'm guessing it will be confirmed within the next 12 hours. Your math is correct.
Click on the 160 sat/b fee bracket, scroll down to the bottom graph. Every block 1MB gets taken off the top. As you can see &gt; 160 sat/b transactions got confirmed earlier today but it's busier now.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:08:40
Less Bitcoin txns are being made during the weekend so the backlog of txns in the mempool goes down. On the 1st this month txns with a 50 sat/B fee got confirmed.
Click on 50-60 fee bracket to get a useful view. Use bottom chart to look at top 1MB of txns to get an idea on what fees are getting confs and what fees you need to use.

A German bank tried to do that when someone bought Bitcoin off me through Localbitcoins (most likely someone gained access to the victims bank account). Luckily my bank did not comply and unfroze my account / funds when I showed them I sold Bitcoin.

The backlog is smaller on weekends so you can get in the next block with less fee. "Really u/kikkerdril I don't believe you!"
Try for yourself:
1. Go to 
2. Scroll down to the last graph
3. Click on the lowest fee bracket so you the end of the graph is lower than 1MB
As you can see if a block will be mined right now all transactions with a 140+ sat/byte fee will be mined.

Fees are measured in satoshi / byte. Miners put the highest paid transactions in the next block they mine. So there is a fee market where you have to compete with other transactions that are in the mempool where the miners take their transactions from. To look at the current mempool / fee status:  (bottom graph, top 1MB will be taken off by miners who find next block, click on fee brackets to remove lower fees from the graph)
You can use it to estimate a low fee and set it manually in Electrum. Sundays are normally less busy so fees are lower. Lots of tech coming to ease the current fee problems:

Every 10 minutes miner's mine a block and receive the current block reward of 12.5 BTC (plus the fees for that block).
So that's 12.5 * 6 * 24 = 1800 BTC mined a day, currently worth 11,400 USD each, totalling 20.52MM USD.
A large part of that will be sold by miners to pay for costs like energy and hardware.

How did you set that &lt;100 sat/B fee? Currently fees around 120 sat/B are confirming. Looking at the bottom graph after you've clicked the 100-120 fee bracket you can see there are 45MB of unconfirmed transactions that paid a higher fee. 
If you use your Ledger Nano S with Electrum you can use CPFP to put a higher fee on the change of your tx to speed up the process.

At this pace txns with fees around 110 sat/B will be confirming in 48h from now. I think the decline will end around 100 and expect fees to go higher again on Wednesday. Perhaps it will move lower than 100 next weekend with the lowest fees on the 1st of January.

Complain to Bittrex, they make too much extra money on this imo. Since they also bundle multiple customer's transactions in a single bitcoin transaction, effectively paying a lot less then 1 mBTC for each withdrawal.
Same goes for most other exchanges btw, since most have a set fee and bitcoin price tends to rise. Fee shouldn't be a fixed btc amount.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:19:28
150 sat/B is enough right now = 1.5mBTC/kB

@_date: 2017-12-04 09:51:16
It happens more often on Gdax because they don't have fees for makers, only for takers. So traders make more limit buys instead of market buys. When the market is less volatile and price goes kinda sideways it creates these standoffs between small bid and asks walls with a cent difference that makes the price more stable for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:45:39
Fees are measured in satoshi / byte. Miners put the highest paid transactions in the next block they mine. So there is a fee market where you have to compete with other transactions that are in the mempool where the miners take their transactions from. To look at the current mempool / fee status:
1. Go to 
2. Scroll down to the last graph
3. Click on the lowest fee bracket so the end of the graph is lower than 1MB
As you can see if a block will be mined right now all transactions with a 200+ sat/byte fee will be mined. Sometimes a lot of transactions are added before a next block is mined. So to be more certain to get your tx in the next block you can add a little higher fee like 225 sat/byte.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:24:40
Currently fees of 400+ sat/byte are being confirmed. You probably have to wait until the weekend for your tx to get a first conf. You can check the state of the mempool at:

What does the US have to do with the type of wallet you use? Go check out software like Electrum, it's easy to set a fee yourself with wallets that support it.
Go and do your research ;)
You could also export your Exodus private keys and import in Electrum to avoid the high fees Exodus likes to add. Another option is to send from Exodus on a Sunday when the bitcoin mempool is normally less full, fees will be lower.

Low priority doesn't make a difference if it has the confirmations. If the receiving address belongs to your Coinbase account they have received it and you should contact them. Be prepared to wait a long time for a reaction cause their support can not handle the huge influx of users.

I wouldn't advise new casual users to chose a heavy-weight client like bitcoin-qt. A light-weight client like [Electrum]( feels more appropriate and forces new users to backup the wallet seed. Other current advantages with Electrum are:
- Deterministic wallets, no need to make new backups
- Coin control, free BTC on a specific address or chose from which addresses you send BTC
- Easy way to do [cold storage with Electrum]( for users who want to put more funds in bitcoin.

Conclusion from the PDF:




* Inscrutable and complex investment 
* No underlying or underpinned value 
* Unpredictable liquidity
* No guarantee of getting repaid
* Multiple technological risks (including data loss and hacking)
* Susceptible to fraud and illegal transactions hence also intervention by the authorities

Try and look for a program named: Bitcoin, Multibit, Electrum or Armory. If you can not find any bitcoin software on the computer then perhaps he was using a webwallet, for instance an account on blockchain.info. Another option is using a wallet on an exchange like bitstamp.net. Or a paper wallet stored somewhere on actual paper.

You would have to trust that the issuer for these paper wallets did not save the private keys himself and steals the coins on it. This makes it that these services are not available or not very successful since most people prefer to make their own paper wallets.
An interesting alternative could be:
Off course here you would also have to trust the service to not steal your coins but you would most likely only put small amounts on there. The advantage is that the bitcoins are not lost if the tip does not get redeemed.

I would use an Android phone or tablet and install [bitcoin wallet]( on it. When a customer wants to pay with bitcoin the server types in the amount in USD on the bitcoin wallet (should be connected to internet if you want it to get the current rate). The wallet converts this to a QR code the customer can scan. Then at the end of the event or day or other time period you send the bitcoins to your coinbase wallet and sell them there.

He does jump to false conclusions.
1. Article author doesn't take people who don't use bitcoin often and only have them at an exchange. This ads a lot of empty deposit addresses to the statistics and a few big cold storage + hot wallet addresses for a lot of people.
2. The author also doesn't take off-blockchain wallet services like Coinbase into account. They have [over a million]( wallet users (obviously some people registered a few but it still adds to the total of bitcoin users). Compared to [1.4 million registered Blockchain.info wallets](
3. Author states that "Just 97 addresses have a balance over 10,000 btc, and two addresses more than 100,000. It’s fair to assume that one of these belongs to Satoshi Nakamoto". Excuse me? That was a quick conclusion without any analysis.

The new merchants also create more selling pressure. For instance early miners now have more possibilities to spend their coins, these coins are mostly dumped on the markets by BitPay. Imagine when merchants starts to pay the employers part of their salary in BTC or start to pay their suppliers with BTC. Then prices will skyrocket since there will be a lot less selling pressure. Also we just came out of a hype-cycle where people who were doubting to step into BTC already stepped in. Now we are forming the foundation for a new hype-cycle where we will see much higher rates so buckle up for the next time mainstream media massively jumps on Bitcoin again :)

Pretty ridiculous, as if their withdrawals are going smoothly outside these bank holidays. Looks to me like everyone is reacting to this notice and doing a bank run. Withdrawals of USD / EUR is impossible or extremely slow. Only solution is to buy BTC and withdraw those.

Depends if it's a deterministic wallet of not (like Electrum or Armory). If you use Bitcoin-qt you currently need to back up more often. By default it creates 100 bitcoin addresses and private keys when you create a wallet. Every time you use a new address Bitcoin-qt adds a new address + private key to the pool. Bitcoin-qt also creates a new address for [change]( So you should create a new wallet.dat backup at least every 100 transactions.

In short: if you currently backup at least every 100 times you have sent something with Bitcoin-QT (minus the number of addresses you have created yourself under the receive tab) you're good.
Bitcoin-Qt [pre-generates 100 addresses]( in your wallet.dat. If you make a 'new' address under the receive tab it takes one out of the 100. But also if you make a transaction and not the whole [output]( for that transaction is spent the change will also go to a 'new' address.
Eventually Bitcoin-Qt will run out of addresses / private keys from the key pool and the client will add new private keys to the key pool. These new private keys are not available in the backup you made before these keys were added to the key pool. So you will effectively lose any bitcoins on those addresses if you use an old backup.
Most likely Bitcoin-Qt v0.9 will implement [deterministic wallets]( where you only have to backup once since the private keys will be created from a seed (where the outcome of private keys will always be the same).

You can sign a message only when you have control over the private keys, so someone can prove he owns this bitcoins address this way. For instance with bitcoin-qt wallet software. File -&gt; Sign message.
In return you receive a signature that others can verify with bitcoin-qt as well, without obtaining your private keys.

A lot of users have problems with BTC withdrawals, but a lot more people have problems with withdrawing USD or EUR. 
Since the problems are stacking up, and the biggest chance to get your funds out of MtGox is to buy BTC and withdraw those, this is still the main reason why the price is currently around 20% higher than Bitstamp / BTC-e.

A company like Paypal could run their internal user's balances off-blockchain and only broadcast a transaction on the bitcoin network if the bitcoins move out of the Paypal ecosystem.
Besides this they could also combine outgoing transactions so you would have multiple withdrawals out of Paypal in one actual bitcoin transaction.

I would register and buy on Bl3p.eu or Bitstamp.net because the rate for bitcoins is lower. Deposit fee for a SEPA transfer on Bl3p  is 50 cents. Coinbase is low level entry for newcomers, so they currently create a lot of demand (higher prices) and they buy from their own exchange, GDAX.
Compare rates at  (I don't know why Bl3p isn't currently listed, it normally is).

Your bank shouldn't have made you into the victim since you are not the scammer / man in the middle. It is not your fault that the "rightful owner" (or his bank) can't properly secure his account. They also stimulate bad security practice for victims and their banks.
I had a similar thing, my bank froze my account, asked me about why I received that transaction, showed them the LBTC sale log, account was unfrozen again with the money from the sale still there.

Very nice! Only downside is, the wallet address QR is not visible without also showing the private key. And there is a small typo in the text (a a copy).

Nice one, he is pointing out a bid wall not a buy on the ticker. Also there have been much bigger buys if this would have been a buy.
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:51:07
Or perhaps on the back side throw the 100 mBTC to the top left corner (same style as front). And then you could use the same style for the public QR as you are using on the front currently.

Mt.Gox has been sending out incorrect transactions for almost three days. They resend them properly in a big batch which resulted in this spike.
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:15:23
24h and 3d gives a distorted image now because a whale decided to put up a 10k wall on Mt.Gox ask that was nibbled at, then some 1k walls that got eaten, then a 6k wall that hold gox down for multiple hours yesterday. Come back in 8 days and try the 7d overview then.

If you believe bitcoin has a solid future you don't have to decide when to sell. Since you will just spend them.

You can also create a wallet, and print a paper wallet as backup, on an offline computer with the open-source wallet client called Armory. More info:
Upside with this method is that it is easier to sent bitcoins from the offline wallet by signing transactions on the offline computer and sending those signed transactions out on your watch-only copy of the wallet on your online computer.

And when you look up that receiving address on blockchain.info does it say it has a balance? Maybe that is just a receiving address on your new blockchain wallet. Your old wallet probably has multiple addresses.

For your info, you also help the network with a full node because you will be relaying transactions so they will reach a miner and be included in a block.

What data did you use, did you include Bitstamp as well? And what about BTC China?
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:13:04
But I thought your problem with paper wallets was using them to trade private keys since 'bitcoins are not a useable medium of exchange'. Looks like you sir, have multiple problems.
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:45:00
I am glad people have the choice to be able to introduce someone to a little BTC with a paper wallet. I am also glad you can chose to not use them yourself. To each his own...

People are hardly trading private keys. Paper wallets are mostly used to give a small amount of bitcoins as a gift.

Do you want this for backup purpases? If yes, you can also choose for a client that uses deterministic wallets. All private keys and bitcoin adresses are created from the same seed. You only need to backup this one seed. Electrum for instance creates a deterministic wallet. Probably bitcoin-qt 0.9 will implement this as well.

Normally you would need to instantly ask support to help you with this. If the buyer doesn't want to return it and withdraws it immediately support can't help you anymore since the bitcoins are gone.
