Anyone else experiencing long transaction times right now?

I don't send BTC around a lot, but last time I did, it didn't take this long. Network must be congested unfortunately.

GDAX has been hardcore manipulated by bots for the past 16 hours or so. It's happening to BTC, ETH, and LTC. IIRC, the ETH bot is about 275 ETH, and the litecoin bot is about 3000 LTC. It's sad that people are gullible enough to think that this is organic. I'm not touching anything until they're gone.
Edit: The ETH bot is 500 ETH. Not sure if the LTC bot is still active.

You took the words right out of my mouth! I get people being anti 'the man' but damn, some people are just grasping at straws trying to find an enemy.

I'm anxious to see what happens. I think another jump is totally plausible, but I really don't think we're going to get through this without another big dip. I think a few of the exchanges having extensions until the end of October definitely will affect people's decisions. I'm looking forward to what happens to the market in a few hours.

Because they're not done and there's still uncertainty. This will take several months to recover from, given that the hard fork is coming up next. Be patient and don't freak out every time a small sell off happens.

The bounce came in the middle of the night in China. It was due to buyers in other parts of the world waking up and seeing the low prices. I reckon we will see another dip tonight.

No. It is not a Chinese exchange.

That's what I'm grappling with... Either they decide to jump back in and try to hold over while this shitstorm passes over, or they see that they can cut their losses and get their money back while they can. They have an election coming up, and if there is a shift in leadership, that may add even more uncertainty to the equation. I think at this point it could go either way. I still do truly believe another dip will happen, but like you said, the mentality may shift and people may want to just jump back into it. Everyone says "don't invest more than you can lose", and while that is true, investing money and having the option to pull it out whenever they want is much different than investing money and not knowing the next time you'll be able to access it. I think it just comes down to a level that none of us will really be able to predict, as much as I'd like to think some of us can lol.

"We don't want one government to have all this control over the price going down, but one person having the power to make the price spike with 140 characters or less? sign me up!" It really gets exhausting hahaha
