Unfortunately, not everything is handled through just a CC-processor. e.g. PayPay, Stripe, MoneyBookers, etc. All of which would sooner put you on the spot than battle the card company on your behalf. Then there is also fraud that does manage to sneak through CVC, AVS, and IP Geolocation checks. Open a site selling iTunes gift cards doing everything right, and then let me know if you feel the same way about fraud.

Hold the BTC until the return period is over. Yeah, it may be an added inconvenience for awhile, but I imagine a large company can make the cash flows work properly. If the customer wants a refund, you have the coins to give back and really are not losing out anything more than you would giving a refund in USD. If you are worried about people manipulating the refund, charge a "restocking" fee.

It must be nice, but pretty much the rest of the world deals with fraud. Ignoring that fact, or gloating about how your special really doesnt change anything.

Probably. I dont think they like when people take advantage of lower RU prices to trade and sell. But it is not far from trading an actual RU user for their games. 
I didnt do it for long because keeping that many games on hand, trying to track all the values and trades, and the slow sales (for specific games) made it more work than it was worth. I never got banned, but it was becoming harder to buy games. When I would go to checkout it would just tell me no sometimes. Installing a game usually reset that ban though.

Word of mouth is def. the best advertising, but there are two issues with it. First, it can be a chicken or the egg type problem, where if there are no customers, they cannot tell their friends. Second, while it is nice to think about it like an STD that spreads quickly, people generally only talk negative about a service / business. Not always, but usually. Do something wrong and everyone knows, do something right and no one does. 
I did overlook the 2 mBTC part, but I also feel like so many BTC businesses feel they have to play the low fees card, and forget to make a sustainable profit. So for me personally, I know I would be willing to pay more and know that the site is going to stick around, and bring me a healthy supply of potential customers. When Bitmit closed and I lost hundreds of listings, it was somewhat disheartening. There were a few sellers who even had way more listings than myself.
On another note, I feel like there are potentially a million talking points to an auction site. So if you are OK with it, maybe I will send you a PM later.

You are right on a few points. I dont want to have a conversation about it, and alts are not going away. I actually referenced the latter when I said, "one of the million alts that have, and will be, created". I am also not concerned about them threatening my Bitcoin holdings. 
If you want to work them, accept them for what they are. Understand that before any alt, especially a joke alt, is going to be accepted by retailers, something serious has to precede it. Stop preemptively irritating major players who are on the fence, because you are going to push them off backwards. Things like Dogecoin are gateway coins that help ease people into a serious coin, so work with what it actually is.
On a side note, so maybe you can stop assuming things, I have lobbied for LTC to be added to most exchanges. Not because I feel LTC needs to succeed per se, but because a non-fiat alternative has to be implemented to allow arbitrage and stabilize the BTC price.

Not sure why they are lower, but they are. To see the RU prices type ?cc=ru at the end of the URL and it will switch to Russian. 1 USD = 35.52 RUB so [Watch Dogs]( is 799 py6 or $22.49 USD.

I am extremely interested, but also concerned. We have already seen two large auction houses fail... 
One reason might be because of the circular reference where buyers go where the sellers are, and sellers go where the buyers are. 
I believe another is a lack of income. eBay hits sellers on both ends with listing fees and final value fees. So a $10 item is netting them around $1.30 without any up sells. Your site brings in $0.25. 
Maybe I am being invasive, but do you think you can make it? Will your revenues be enough to have decent advertising? Also, do you plan on creating extensions for popular platforms (OpenCart, Magento, Bitshop, etc.) to automatically import items from stores?

... Your calling my comment dumb because you want to hedge BTC with refrigerators... Let me process that for another moment or two...
Taking advantage of price movements is one thing, but to actually hedge against BTC? I think there are better ways. Besides, that is why my original comment included charging a restocking fee for returns. i.e. customer gets charged 10% for returning an appliance. My second comment explains why all of this is irrelevant.

Company is a broad term, and within are sole-proprietorship / partnerships and corporations. The former are an extension of the owner(s) of the business, so all profits (retained earnings or not) are taxed at the end of the year based on the owners tax bracket. This also implies that in the even of a lawsuit, the owners would be held personally responsible and could lose personal property (house, car, etc.). 
Corporations on the other hand are legally their own entity, pay their own taxes, and manage their own assets. While they can be owned by individuals (sole-proprietors), they can also be owned by other businesses, and in either sense you cannot usually hold the owners responsible for the shortcomings of the business. Retained earnings are still taxed, but taxed on the corporation; and the only taxes paid by owners are wages or dividends (double taxation).
LLC merges the two into a hybrid. It reduces owner liability while maintaining a more simple tax structure.

total of reversals / no. of orders = fraud per order
profit / orders = avg. profit per order
fraud per order / avg. profit per order = discount rate
Offering a bigger discount for BTC will result in less profits than taking the fraud; while a smaller discount will increase profits (not including increased sales due to discount)

Well there are still benefits to accepting BTC because it isnt strictly a one way street. For example, gift cards also hedge fraud by moving liability to the merchant. So when it comes to fees and fraud BTC still reigns king.
I completely agree with Minecraft though. When BitVegas first came out I messaged the creator and begged him to create a community and economy around the casino. Something with a central trade hub and property rights. Most of what I have seen so far though is microscopic rewards for mining dirt blocks.
@_date: 2014-01-08 02:54:20
Yeah, I actually almost included something about that. However, the general trend is upward and most of the bubbles probably would not be a concern by the time the refund period is actually over. e.g. A price drop would most likely return to payment prices or higher by the time they were to cash out the coins. 
Anyways, someone else pointed out that this is just an over dramatized post and I now agree. If inventory is based in USD and sold for an equivalent of USD, then refunds should also be in USD.

There are some good points about the government never knowing of this extra income, so why report it?
However, those who wish to see the currency become more than the underworld of the Internet that enables online drug sales and illegal gambling might want to consider a different approach. 
Anyways consider it cash and think about how not reporting that can bite you in the ass. For example, maybe you become bitcoin rich and circumvent the traditional banking systems to buy everything you ever wanted. Will they catch you? Probably not, but if you do get audited I am sure they will wonder why you report income of $10k and live in a $1m house. Remember, drug dealers do not always get busted for dealing.

Generally potential customers do not point out flaws.

EDIT: Read very slowly - Questions about alt-coins, such as Litecoin, generally get down voted here on r/bitcoin. These questions also usually receive quite a few comments that refer to any alt-coins as "scam coins". However, if you feel that investing in these alt-coins is the best choice, then you should invest anyways. Only do what you think is right. Please do not assume that I am either for, or against alt-coins.

I agree with everything, except I see one purpose for an alt (most specifically LTC). That is to finally bridge the gap between exchanges. Most would agree that the volatility is a major issue for mass adoption, but the huge spreads between exchanges does not help either. One place a coin is worth $80 or $100 more than another, yet no one can fix it due to the problems with fiat. Adding an alt-coin to the exchanges would allow the much needed arbitrage to take place. Once arbitrage can happen, the market would finally move as one. More volume would be needed for rapid price swings, but most importantly, other exchanges (e.g. BTC-e) could finally stop following Gox lead.

I regret even replying to any of this idiocy... Go beat your head off a wall for a few hours and think about things like fraudulent and permanent transactions, and laws and regulations. Actually, let me make it easier to understand...
Companies that get ripped off lose money. Buying Bitcoins with a debit/credit card leads to a lot of reversals. Reversals mean losing money. Losing money leads to no company. Your impatience is not a factor in of a extremely high-risk market.
So if you dont want to pay a premium for local coins and get them now, then you dont want them bad enough and should shut the fuck up about having to wait.

Before Bitcoin I had a 20% markup (still do on some items) to cover the fees of using a payment processor.

That is the second time I have heard this flawed misconception that BTC:LTC will always maintain an even ratio. They wont and I cant understand why anyone would think that... 
In the sense that they would be traded back to even ratio yes, but staying perfectly even at all times is crazy. Someone who is good at arbitrage (and probably using bots) will take advantage of momentary discrepancies to bring the market back to even. Which is my entire point! There is no possible way that they would remain in sync across multiple exchanges or BTC would already be doing exactly that.

First off, good luck getting them to reply to an email. Doesnt happen...
There are flaws in their method of accepting BTC that as far as I know have not been resolved. For example, buyer sends a partial payment, then asks for refund. Once refund is given, buyer sends remaining amount and completes sale since there is no refund option to let them know. Not such a big deal with physical goods, but a really big deal when you sell digital goods like I do with automated delivery.
I made the mistake to automatically deposit to my bank account for a few days. Payments never came, as usual emails were ignored. I had to complain on Reddit post of theirs to have it fixed.
Most recently, I have been trying to move my remaining coins out of Coinbase since the May 18th. 24hrs later I get an email saying the transaction was unconfirmed. Multiple ignored emails later the problem still remains 3 weeks later.

I didnt have time to post my full reply earlier and got downvoted to hell, so here is why I said Coinbase is garbage.
Issue 1: I was trying to use them on my site, had some issues and questions about the API, emailed multiple times, posted on the public help, and did not ever get a reply.
Issue 2: Had general questions about addressing a possible vulnerability in their system, got cookie cutter "thank you" reply after a few weeks.
Issue 3: Set up for them to deposit right to my bank account instead of holding BTC. They said they paid, nothing ever came in. After weeks of emailing them, I finally caught a topic here on Reddit they made and talked shit. Then my problem was finally fixed. [link](
Issue 4: I went to move my final coins out of Coinbase and 24 hours later got an email that something went wrong, blah blah blah. Tried to move them again, same thing. Emailed, no reply. Tried again, same, emailed. Tried to sell them, same thing, emailed again. Anyways, I have tried to move them 6 times now over ~2 months, sent multiple emails, and if I get a reply its some bullshit about "oh, we told the tech". Still nothing is fixed and I have coins I cannot touch.

I am trying to implement bitcoin into my site, however I deliver game codes (XBL, iTunes, LoL, ect.) through email. So I need to know the address to send the codes to.
I started trying to implement with WalletBit, and when I went to test via sandbox it didnt work. Three days later (after a follow up) I finally got a reply to my email asking why it didnt work. The answer was, oh we have it disabled, but here is .01 btc to test with. Then I found out my handler could not pick up the custom / additional variable. I emailed, waited four days, emailed again. Waited three more days, emailed again, and still have not got a response... Turns out they are not even passing it back as they claim they do.
BitPay seems fairly easy, but the options seem to be either use the instant buttons or create a full cart implement. Nothing in between. I was trying to do things the easy way and simply alter the input values and create a handler to process the orders. Not happening with BitPay. However, I think if you are only offering a few products and want a quick implementation this is probably the route you should take.
I am trying out Coinbase now and hope that this will be my answer.

Both Coinbase and Bitpay have options to "cash out" as soon as the sale is made. So most retailers do not need an exchange. 
However, when I am selling places like the now dead Bitmit, I choose to use Bitstamp. Simply because it was the closest in value to Coinbase, and that is where I sell my coins when I am forced to.

I cannot agree with that either, and evidence is in the second massive price swing in just a few months. Certainly there were a lot of people burnt when BTC went from $266 to $50 in a matter of minutes.

I will look into that.
@_date: 2013-02-07 03:51:39
First off let me explain that I have a site where I have been doing exactly this for the past few years. There is no way that you are not going to see the codes, after all someone will have to put them into the system. Bigger issues you will face will be accidentally double sending codes and typos. Yes, some people will try to tell you that the code has already been used. So keep very good records of everything. I actually keep the cards for around a year after they are sold, along with a text log of the codes / date purchased, and the transactions are stored in the database. I also keep the receipts forever. You also need to be clear  about how you will handle refunds, problematic codes, etc. Because if you are responsible for a bad code, then its best to fix the problem as quickly as possible, but giving them away just because someone claims it didnt work will put you in the negative quickly. 
Anyways, as mentioned, you will have to see the codes, but that is not where the major trust issues will happen. The first big hurdle is "are these legit?" Because some sellers will use stolen credit cards to buy iTunes cards and sell them on eBay etc. In the past iTunes has actually suspended any account that used those cards (even though that user bought it). Some people just send fake codes, some intentionally send used ones, some just think that the code generators are perfect and try to sell those codes. So there really are far bigger issues than you seeing the codes. Just be honest and provide what you say you are going to. 
I am also trying to implement bitcoin into my site as we speak and will hopefully have it working by tonight.

First time I came across Bitcoin and found out it was mined by computers I closed the window. Never saw a price or anything, I just assumed these were free little tokens people were trying to add value to. Once I finally looked at it again months later I realized that it is pure fucking genius! But BTC was already at $15 by then...

I try not to be overly aggressive in my response to stupid comments, but are you seriously that fucking retarded?
I was conveying the general attitude by the majority of the members of r/bitcoin. As in whenever an alt-coin comment surfaces, it gets down voted and spammed with comments about how alts are nothing but scam coins. At no point did I say, or imply, that I personally felt alts were scams. However, if you represent the average alt-coin user, then it would be best to avoid anything but BTC...

You create a ladder with scaling maximum bets. New accounts can only bet very small (or even free-rolls) until they prove themselves. By the time that happens they are playing for higher amounts against others who have proven themselves. I think you are over exaggerating and over thinking this.

Did you have to manually code to take bitcoins with Bitpay or Coinbase? Can you process with Google Wallet, Stripe, Money Bookers, Amazon Payments, or much of anything other than PayPiss?
They are another site that was good in '95 but their refusal to adapt to ever changing markets has put them in a position that they will not recover from. They know it too, why do you think they have been "updating" for years but have nothing to show for it? Business either adapt and use the momentum to accelerate, or they dont and they fight to just stay alive.

Im not concerned with the spread between currencies, just the one between exchanges. And something that is not either 1. Bitcoin or 2. regulated currency is the only thing that can easily be used to level the exchanges. So many fools down vote logic because it doesnt happen to be their perfect picture for XBT.

For one it is a highly used chart. So those paranoid fingers that are not well navigated in Bitcoinland might not appreciate not being able to compare multiple exchanges easily.

There is no USD involved... Just BTC&gt;LTC and LTC&gt;BTC. Someone doing it right would have both on both exchanges. The only concern is the initial buy-in.
EDIT: example) Sell 1 BTC on Gox for 500 LTC. At the same time, buy 1 BTC from Bitstamp for 450 LTC. Brings the price closer, and trader profits 50 LTC.

That transfer problem was a while back and they did since fix it. It just took them a few months.
@_date: 2013-09-07 20:07:45
My basic outlook is, who cares if people pay with chickens if it takes no extra effort to make it cash? With services like Bitpay, all payments can go directly to USD. No exchange rate risk, no extra accounting hassles, just cash. Plus, it would be a rather large promotion in what should be a highly targeted demographic.

I think your best investment right now would be a high school kid that you pay $5/hr to do nothing more than log issues and reply to emails. Even a simple, "Hey valued customer, we fucked up but are fixing it as soon as possible. Sorry about that. -hug-" would seriously help negate the need for stupid posts like this. Personal communication is far better than some community post because you ignore people.
In fact, long before these issues started, I decided that I wouldnt be using Coinbase despite significantly lower fees and the fact that I retail low markup items. Simply because if you are dealing with my money, I want to know that I can get a reply / support in a reasonable amount of time. I still have ~5 unanswered emails to you. These recent issues just push me to stop being lazy and actually switch, and it really is a shame.

Dude, Im not the one who originally referenced the price increase. But if **you** put a little abstract thought into what I wrote, you might come to the conclusion that they are not adding a markup solely because of a convenience factor. I agree that for the common fool there can be a high barrier to entry, but that barrier is equally displaced by the true motivation to enter the market.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:19:47
Because they refuse to add LTC so people can successfully arbitrage them, and therefore keep the markets level with less volatility.

I made my first purchase with Coinbase on 15Feb, and as crazy as it is, they were delivered yesterday. I was fully expecting the order to be cancelled because 1) it was my first order 2) so many others were cancelled 3) there were apx. $30 in gains in that time on 10 btc.
However, good luck getting a reply to questions about using Coinbase to accept BTC as a merchant... 4 emails, 2 forum posts, a tweet, and many weeks later I still have no answers. Just straight out ignored.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:51:01

@_date: 2013-11-14 14:48:37
So your saying there is circular reasoning? BTC cannot be stabilized because individuals will not accept it as payment because it is not stabilized.
@_date: 2013-09-28 19:12:27
I would suggest Bitpay instead. They have plugins for most cart platforms as well. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:43:26
I can pull up emails from some of my old tickets. March time frame, and they didnt reply then either. In fact, one of my questions I sent, sent again two weeks later, posted on the forum a week after that and still did not get a reply for nearly two months. And it was a question about their API! So no, if anything customer service has improved.

But it can still be disputed by "not as described" I think.
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:28:14


This alone makes a lot of inaccurate assumptions. First, that someone is being forced to take BTC as payment. By the time we get to that point, e.g. USD is not an option, the price will be stabilized because no one will compare USD to BTC as a valuation. It will simply be BTC. So if this person decides to take BTC instead of USD, they are very likely to already understand the risks of doing so. I sell low mark-up goods for BTC so a small drop in price puts me in the red. I do it anyways because I have faith that the value will return after it dips. 
As for security, there are new companies with better advancements almost daily. Dont want to trust a company? Use a paper wallet. There are a million guides on how to do it correctly. 
Finally, speculation may be a primary motivator, but the underlying utility is what keeps things from blowing up. BTC really does have a globally useful purpose.
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:39:15
I just hope that the massive flaws in Coinbase that they refuse to properly address leave enough room for a qualified competitor to enter the market. They have a first mover advantage, and are already well known, but...

@_date: 2013-11-14 14:40:21
Your point is moot. By force I mean BTC is the standard, just as USD is (for Americans) now. I am saying that by the time the norm is to be paid in BTC there will not be volatility. 
If they choose to accept it prior, then they likely know (and accept) the risks inherent to doing so. Saying BTC, PayPal, or check is comparing apples to oranges.

It is called arbitrage, and is near impossible. Which is why the price is different. It is too hard to move funds back and forth quickly. i.e. Buying on Gox, sending to Bitstamp, **cashing out, depositing Gox**, repeat process.

I use Coinbase on my site (bad idea). The other day someone made an order, the email came to me and said it sent a callback to my site. That callback did finally show up, some 14 hours later... The balance did not show in my transactions for 2 days, but it did show under merchant tools. But when I clicked on it, it went to a 404.
An order came in not too long ago, again with a delayed callback. The customer emailed me and for some unknown reason they said he ordered something far different than what he actually did...

When I first started using them, I had questions about their API as I was trying to implement. I didnt get a reply for something like 2 months. I found a possible vulnerability with BTC payments, told them about it, and again didnt get a reply for a long time. When I was having them deposit cash for sales, my deposits just never came through, and again the issue wasnt fixed until I openly ranted about it on one of their posts here. I have had other issues as well, which is why I generally try to avoid them, but I think this pretty well covers it. They have bugs, and that is one thing, but ignoring customers when you have their money just isnt right. Bitpay on the other hand, when I email them stupid questions that they probably get all the time, like do you plan on implementing Litecoin, I get a reply in an hour.

It is half-ass companies that get in too deep and cannot handle the pressures of rapid expansion that are going to be the downfall of BTC. The biggest and most know exchange is a total joke and the community refuses to move away from it. BFL has just been a joke from the start, but know one of the few trusted, and large, companies fucks up this big... Who would want to get involved. BTC is never going to grow to full potential with the backbone is has now.
