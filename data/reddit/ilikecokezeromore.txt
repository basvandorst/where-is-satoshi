That'd be nice.  Who knows if it will happen again, though. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:07:00
Okay guys, I put in my buy.  Sorry for the impending dip!
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:34:07
I'll do a ton for that wet carrot.  Please, rich sir, please give me 1 BTC which is less than one wet carrot. 
I'll send you a picture of my calves every week, and of course NEVER use Poloniex in your honor!

Man good for you.  For the longest time my goal has been to get to .5, and even with the crash it's just not in reach.  Still I try, still I try.

The exchanges are controlling acquisition.  My bitcoin is mine, entirely.

So I am getting ready to buy my first sizable amount of bitcoin.  It has been a big decision and a lot of hard work to get the capital, but I'm ready to put it in.  How does one go about finding a good entry price to start the purchasing process??  I've seen people talking about dropping down to around 6k and others blowing up to 12k.  I don't know charts and really am on the fence about buying now or waiting...

Thanks for the reply - who would be the right people?  I know there isn't certainty and to take replies with a grain of salt..but I've already had some great food for thought in response.

You can't just create millions of Bitcoin for free.  What are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:47:29
where do you think it settles?
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:38:36
HERE WE GO BOIS
@_date: 2018-03-30 06:44:43
nahhh, we good now.  let the healing begin.  Man i was having some panic for a bit, but feel good now.

I appreciate the sound advice, that's a pretty dang good point.  Maybe I'll see what it does through Sunday as I have seen some mini-dips these past few weekends.  Might have a painful couple weeks or months but then should feel pretty damn good about it.
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:35:54
We were lower last month...this isn't done!
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:40:14
Good god, what a dream!  Today brought me back into the green, but my a negligible amount.  Still happy with it though!  Now hopefully we can do some rising.
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:05:30
This would be good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:14:36
I see no reason to debate the issue with you.  There is plenty of information available to those with eyes to see.
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:15:16
I've been thinking about changing from Gmail to Proton for the longest time.  I just hate the idea of paying for my email service (even though I see the value proposition clear as day).
@_date: 2018-04-21 00:47:40
Oh sweet summer child...
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:26:31
Not happening.  I'm holding the line with me &lt;1 BTC!!! 
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:45:43
Funds are just too tight right now, but as soon as the annual fee feels less intimidating I think I'm going to go for it.  I'll probably keep my gmail, but transition anything I care about to the new account.  Hopefully my portfolio booms and I can do this soon! ;)
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:51:22
Will this be the address I see on the sending in of 0.453 BTC to me?  Because if it is I love you!
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:16:24
You can still safely use that wallet though, right?  I believe the software creates new seeds.  I'm not saying I want to, but hypothetically isn't the device itself still viable?

I'm an atheist, but that man is the devil himself
@_date: 2018-04-03 02:18:05
redditor for 4 weeks lol
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:36:35
Definitely, get it!
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:11:18
That makes much more sense.  Where the hell does one even go to buy gold?
@_date: 2018-04-11 02:58:46
Good advice, will jot it down.  Definitely not 1000% up, but that'd be a fantastic benchmark to do just that.
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:23:27


Philip Morris?  If so I'd love to hear why...
@_date: 2018-04-19 01:35:10
he got 0.50 USD in there, somebody took the bait about a month ago it seems 
@_date: 2018-04-11 02:15:30
Tens of millions?  Yeah, don't have to worry about that one.  I don't even have a half a bitcoin 
*drowns in tears*
