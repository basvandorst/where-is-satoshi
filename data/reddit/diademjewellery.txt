Hi, Sorry for the late reply! It's really hard to tell to be honest. All I can say is that of the 15% that purchase in BTC 100% of them are different customers and have a higher likelyhood of purchasing from outside of the UK :)

Yes!   - our site sells handmade pieces and accepts bitcoin and other crypto/Fiat currencies. Anything I can do to help let me know.

Cheers! It was sheer lack of demand. Bitcoin makes up approximately 15% of all our online sales. Altcoins 0%.

I always try to convince the shop managers to keep it! They've not chosen to change it so far so hopefully they'll forget :)

We're still new to Reddit so apologies if this is in the wrong sub! I wanted to say a huge thanks to the entire Bitcoin community. Since opening our store in Altrincham (and our website online) we have had countless conversations with Bitcoin enthusiasts about how we can improve our website, how we can attract crypto-enthusiasts and how to do business better. Without your help we wouldn't be looking to grow the business online and expand our physical presence. 
If anyone would like a voucher by way of thanks then please feel free to send me a message. We love feedback so if you notice anything on the site that doesn't look/feel right, please let us know, we can take it.
Thanks again you lovelies :)
