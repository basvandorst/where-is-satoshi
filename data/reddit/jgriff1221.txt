Is there any way to tell how my investment is doing?

 Here is a copy of the letter from Kraken-
Hi  
Kraken is discontinuing service in Washington state on Wednesday March 15th. This decision comes after careful consideration of our revenue and operating costs in Washington. While revenue continues to grow, operating costs have become prohibitive, primarily due to the high cost of continuing to meet the regulatory compliance requirements imposed by the state.
Unfortunately it has become impractical for us to operate in Washington and we must discontinue service for all residents. Since you are a Washington resident, we are sorry that we must suspend all services in your account. Services will be turned off in two steps according to the schedule below:
Wednesday March 15th: Deposits and trading will be suspended for all Washington residents - please stop all trading before this date
Wednesday March 22nd: Withdrawals will be suspended for all Washington residents - please withdraw all accounts funds before this date
After withdrawals are suspended it will still be possible to get your funds, but you will need to contact support for special instructions and processing will likely take much longer than normal. If you have any trouble withdrawing your funds, please submit a support request to: 
Use the subject/category “WA Resident” to help ensure a quick response.
MtGox Creditors
If you have filed a MtGox creditor claim through Kraken, don’t worry. We will still be able to process your claim distribution with a one-time transfer after we receive the distribution funds from the MtGox trustee. (If you are looking for an update on the MtGox claims process please see the MtGox trustee website for the latest information: 
It has been an honor to serve the digital asset community in Washington state and we are very sorry to part ways. We will resume service if it again becomes practical to do so and will contact you with the good news.
The Kraken Team

I fired off a letter Asking why Wa was grouped with Iran, Afghanistan ... to DFI when Kraken told me to hit the road and got this response -( I did not contact her as I do not speak that well when enraged, and I thought "still have Polo no worries")
Thank you very much for your email to the Department of Financial Institutions regarding Bitcoin Exchanges.  I looked at your email and wanted to discuss it with you.  Would you mind sending me your phone number and I will call you, or you can call me at 360-902-0515?
 
Thank you,
 
Catherine Mele-Hetter

Thanks for your diagnosis.
Like I said I still had Polo. Now that that is gone I intend to get back with her this week. I am quite angry.  
 
I would like to encourage anyone else to talk with them as well.

Thank you Griff
