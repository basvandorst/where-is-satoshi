If a US business were to pay a monthly franchise fee to its foreign franchisor in Bitcoin how would this be viewed by the tax man pre and post adoption of your proposal?

Where did you hear that they will upgrade on the 11th?
I'm trying to withdraw funds the past hour, I don't wanna get MtGoxed.

I can confirm that they did not fix anything, you must have gotten lucky :)

This is ace but I think in the future the fraction should be otherwise represented (like 1 mBTC). Otherwise as BTC rises in value you'll have the same problem as Zimbabwe.

Genius way to sell those old hardrives.

Irony levels are off the chart here, love it. This could be a great post but maybe shouldn't choose the phrase "Don't invest more than you can lose" since that's actually golden advice.

Me too, but that crash today would have gone way lower otherwise. At least the added stability gives it more value, which in the end is good for all traders

I go on Kraken when I know I have half an hour spare for repeatedly attempting to put through orders until 1 goes through. 9/10 come back with errors.
Any recommendations for alternatives?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:24:25
I don't doubt it for a second
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:56:04
Yeah I agree. I'm not saying that what they do is 'okay', just saying that eventually we benefit from the overall affect of market stability (higher valuation)

Maybe if more people tipped the release of these articles journalists wouldn't have their work published behind paywalls.

Anyway, never mind. I thought I had made the point pretty clear but it looks like it's completely lost on anyone who reads it. Am I crazy? Am I the only one who understand what I'm trying to say? I obviously did extremely bad job of explaining myself.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:50:08
I can see how it might not be completely clear, but only really to someone who didn't read it, that's why I wrote:
  "I'm not going to get in to the names of denominations, that's totally open to debate, I am however **for this exercise going to use a naming system that makes sense to me**. "
I'm using my own naming system to illustrate the difference between referring to units of Bitcoin as decimal numbers, and referring to them as whole numbers.

People who invest in Bitcoins now may end up having a distinct economic advantage over those who take it up too late. 
Do the world a favour and let him have this one, let it be our little secret. There's loads of people out there who as soon as you start explaining bitcoin are gripped and want to know more, tell them about it.
Alternatively just print of this page and hand it in.

What is it about SI units you reckon you understand that I don't understand? By referring to the currency in this way instead of decimals we are some how breaking the rules of the SI convention? KG are the the base unit for weight but do you say "grams" or do you say "0.001kgs"?
1 Kilosat is a 1000 satoshis (using my naming convention for illustration purposes) and a milicoin is 1000th of a bitcoin. Why do you think you're doing it right and I'm doing it "wrong"? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:08:13
Alright darling no need to get upset, does being rude to people make you feel better?
It's not about the naming system, try reading it again. The point is just starting to use positive numbers. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:18:47
I would say "35 Kilosats". Pretty easy to count with I reckon. Your wallet could change the denomination according to how much you have whether its 1.02BTC or 1.02KS Obviously, you call it what you like. We already do this everywhere. In the US "Nickles", "Dimes", "Quarters" for example. In the UK they say "grand" instead of 1000. In Argentina "Mango", "Gamba", "Luca", "Palo".
  
If I'm having trouble having the agility to read a decimal number written fully and have it correspond to the prefix in my mind then I would guess I'm not the only one. I think working from the bottom up it would be easier to do that mental arithmetic.
Anyway, thanks for your input (not being sarcastic this time).
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:07:12
Sorry, I've looked at the list of prefixes, I've given what you're saying some long thought and I still can't see any reason why we can't start referring to bitcoins using other units as the base. We do this with every type of measurement, there's no good reason why this can't be done with bitcoin. 
I also didn't get what you meant by "lots of 1x10-8". And what is "special" thing you refer to that makes something a unit or not a unit?. 
All the bitcoin apps and clients could be modified to display the values in different units. It doesn't mean we have to change the technology running in the background. I think the logic in your argument is comparable to those who say "bitcoin isn't real money" and they come out with a barrage of reasons that only show their inability to get their head around the concept.
If you want to leave any more source of info please go ahead, I'll check them out in case there's some crazy massive thing I've been missing all along..

What if we gave a name for $1million, lets say "Dolarino" and said that everything below it was a decimal? You have 0.009580  of a Dolarino. Doesnt it make sense to say $9580?
Your example of the race track does a great job of ridiculing my argument, but if we use the example of the current way we use dollars or any currency, then my argument makes a lot more sense.
One thing that is for sure is it's too early to count in Satoshis, but it's also high time we stopped just talking about btc.
Hey thanks for the advice on practising to learn what numbers mean, I'll keep that in mind.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:32:28
Whatever you call the different denominations is irrelevant in the point I'm making. I didn't suggest you call anything "hectosats", put your reading glasses on.
It doesn't have to remain a decimal number when talking about it. It doesn't have to always, and wont always be talked about as fractions and decimals of Bitcoin. That would be pointless.
1 Bitcoin will one day be unobtainable by most working/middle class, why are people going to use it as a base for naming the quantities of currency they're dealing with? Would you talk about using .001 of a grand to by a drink? You think the bitcoin app on your phone will still say 0.0002 in the future? People aren't going to want to keep looking at zeros.
The point is we should start making that transition sooner rather than later to facilitate the up take of bitcoin.

and it looks like you're right, Satoshi [does get it...](
