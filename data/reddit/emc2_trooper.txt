Same shit happening to me at work today. But you know what I told them while they were rubbing it in? I said I sold last night while I saw it dropping and bought back in this morning at 9% lower netting me a sweet $600. Which is heaps more than what I made at work today. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:38:30
Yep that’s how a free market works. Nothing to do with the price 
@_date: 2019-07-04 06:40:09
Your dad sounds kind a great father. You’re lucky to have him
@_date: 2019-07-07 10:39:44
Did you just tip someone the equivalent of 5c? Lol
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:38:12
Weak hands are escaping
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:57:04
OP WTF this was my post! Lol
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:46:51
If nobody trades gold it becomes worthless. See how retarded you sound?
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:13:53
Doesn’t quite have the same ring to it
@_date: 2018-09-20 03:12:10
That’s it boys, we’ve made it.
@_date: 2018-05-09 14:40:50
You're very welcome. Happy to help.
@_date: 2018-08-31 23:52:15
Just think this dude can wake up in the morning and be tens of millions richer or poorer.

Hey cool TBS is here! Is this a crossover episode with @_date: 2018-05-10 15:02:15
Not sure what you’re referring to
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:03:05
Sure, but even then it was risky keeping coins in someone else’s wallet. It always has been. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 05:54:28
Haven’t seen any gains in a loooong time
@_date: 2018-05-09 14:32:09
So you're saying you purchased bitcoin on coinbase, the bitcoins are stored on the exchange now and you can't withdraw them to a wallet? Or, are you trying to sell the coins now and withdraw your money?
@_date: 2018-05-09 14:28:02
Hardware wallet is best. For software based, I use Electrum.
@_date: 2018-05-09 14:38:36
That's fine! All you need to do is send your bitcoin to a different  exchange (Probably Canada based), where you can then sell the coins for CAD.
I did a little research and some people recommend QuadrigaCX.
What you need to do is set up a new account on there, then send your bitcoins from coinbase to the new exchange. Then, sell your coins at the new exchange for CAD and withdraw to your bank account.
Let me know if you have any difficulty!
@_date: 2018-05-13 05:27:22
Yeah I remember when I was 16.
@_date: 2018-05-10 00:53:51
Lol yes
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:51:49
Thanks I’m an idiot. I meant Electrum lol
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:03:56


No I think you’re alright there. Should be fine ��the ‘s’ stands for safe.
@_date: 2018-05-10 07:37:46
Which antivirus are you running? Some have many false-positives.
@_date: 2018-05-10 12:22:49
Yeah good chance it’s a false positive then. Make sure you download from the real electrum.org site! 
@_date: 2018-05-09 14:32:59
Thank Roger and his henchmen for that.

Sued for defamation? Nah it’s free speech mate and this is reddit. Nobody knows I’m a dog on the internet.
@_date: 2018-05-10 13:59:19
Not sure if this is serious or not, but in case it is, I highly recommend Electrum. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 14:49:49
Thanks, I’ll edit my comment.
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:34:07
SCAM ALERT:  STOLE my 0.05 BTC!
@_date: 2018-05-09 14:29:15
Wallets. There seems to be a lot of new users making wallets on these weird websites and getting scammed because the private keys were shared with the website too.
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:28:45
But not a wallet
@_date: 2018-10-17 04:11:32
Uhh no I just found this now
@_date: 2018-10-17 18:39:38
A5 size, it wasn’t folded. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 04:23:28
Ok boys place your bets now. Post a comment and in 1 year I will remind you all and we'll all have a good laugh in our lambos about it.
@_date: 2018-10-17 07:40:31
Hoping someone here knows who made it. Honestly so weird to see it turn up in the mail. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 11:10:35
What the hell can scammers even use iTunes gift cards for? Buying apps and music?
@_date: 2018-10-17 18:37:46
Why would I make this up? It’s A5 size, small enough for a letterbox
@_date: 2018-10-17 23:03:11
It was A5. Small enough for a letterbox
@_date: 2017-08-26 05:02:27
Consider it a long term investment. Do your best to forget about it and set a reminder to check it in 2 years time! 
@_date: 2018-10-17 18:40:53
Please don’t 
@_date: 2018-10-11 19:38:40
It’s a commonly posted joke on this sub. Someone buys them we blame them for the drop.
@_date: 2018-10-17 18:40:14
Yep same thoughts here. It reeks of desperation 
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:01:09
It's just FUD. Stop looking at 1 day/week graphs and look at monthly. To the fucking moon ☝️
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:09:13
Just a question.. how exactly did he recover your pass? Did he also use bruteforce?
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:53:55
It's never too late to switch
@_date: 2019-11-22 01:04:15
Let me stare into my crystal ball... ��
@_date: 2018-10-17 07:38:03
I can totally understand the skepticism but I did not make this. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:39:25
thanks tone
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:55:03
@_date: 2018-10-18 08:49:54
So tell me how I’m supposed to prove I didn’t make this?
@_date: 2018-10-17 23:03:19
No idea
@_date: 2018-10-17 08:01:39
Still didn't make it, hence the post title.
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:20:50
nice try tone.
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:38:26
Awesome. Glad I was able to buy some more. Thanks for the bitcoin, guys.
@_date: 2019-08-20 01:12:15
Obviously it was aliens.
@_date: 2018-06-12 00:51:37
Good luck OP. I can’t help but laugh because it went up 2% after this post was made but I do wish you the best and sincerely hope you are wrong :)
@_date: 2019-10-17 06:20:45
She bought a Trezor Model T
@_date: 2019-10-17 09:34:26
That's how facebook messenger works dude. It comes up with her picture on my messages to show my mum has seen it. Try it yourself.
Trust me I have better things to do than make up fake conversations for lol
@_date: 2019-10-17 22:34:19
Go and describe what a Trezor is to your parents and see if the word ‘bank’ comes up at all in that discussion. Then you might understand.
@_date: 2019-10-17 09:36:37
what do you mean?
@_date: 2019-10-17 22:43:07
Congrats, your parents at smarter than mine.
@_date: 2019-10-17 05:28:56
I agree, but the way I explained a wallet to her is that she is her own bank. That’s why she calls it a bank device.
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:02:32
According to your post history, you sold your last bitcoin 17 days ago. much? You know, looking at your post history you just seem like a sad skeptic who hates technology and will be left behind. I doubt you have ever owned any BTC to begin with. 
@_date: 2019-10-17 23:39:57
Thanks dude. We decided she will use a weekly buying service and save up using by dollar cost averaging for a year. It will be here in a couple days and I’m excited to set her up with it! Won’t be long before my dad joins in too I think ��
@_date: 2019-10-17 03:47:30
Lol yeah now that I read it without context it does sound that way.
@_date: 2019-10-17 09:35:48
Thanks dude. I used to use a software wallet and swapped to a Trezor 3 months ago and haven't looked back. Sleeping much easier now!
@_date: 2019-10-09 21:25:38
That poor GIF. Look how they have massacred my boy.
@_date: 2019-02-23 00:21:19
If you bought 1 bitcoin a year ago, you'd now have 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:59:42
You forgot this “/s”
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:45:02
I can see layer lines on the coin, definitely printed but with multi material hotend

@_date: 2019-12-30 00:12:23
I wish!
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:52:20
Yes you can. So long as you have the seed, you have access to the wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:54:21
I use that app too, it’s real nice. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:56:24
I can’t buy quick enough :(
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:39:08
Yes its the way
@_date: 2019-12-30 04:01:40
Yeah got my mum into buying bitcoin earlier this year. She buys it weekly by DCA.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:56:17

Poor OP is now @_date: 2019-04-30 02:24:29
What a rubbish photoshop OP lol.
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:35:48
Why would you want this on a shirt? It will only be relevant for about 3 days. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 21:13:19
*Which of you, OP.
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:48:25
But... he’s not anonymous.
@_date: 2019-01-11 05:35:12
He’s the one who wrote the tweet.
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:48:59
I think you underestimate how big 16 million is
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:57:52
Wow that's hardcore. I'm currently signed up to a bitcoin saver scheme where I pay $200 a week for some bitcoins at the market value
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:00:08
Yeah it’s only worth what others are willing to pay. Economics 101
@_date: 2017-09-25 03:26:55
Why do you care so much about how people spend their money? 
@_date: 2018-11-22 02:10:35
Print it then? Not everything has to be printed on a T-shirt to make a statement lol. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:56:27
Do you not have a job? How are your wages paid? How do you pay your bills? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:28:13
Well if you've waited 7 years, why don't you wait a little longer? We're probably going to see $5k very soon. Maybe cash out a coin or two every week and it will last you years and years. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:57:52
Wow that's hardcore. I'm currently signed up to a bitcoin saver scheme where I pay $200 a week for some bitcoins at the market value

Holy shit this is the most entitled thing I have ever read. That is god damn pathetic lol.
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:01:35
Says the person with a literally 0 day account lol.
@_date: 2017-09-12 03:09:07
what's the catch?
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:36:47
He’s got this ‘feeling’, just trust him bro! 
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:13:10
What the fuck �� I think I’m on some kind of list now 
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:41:06
Don't worry bro, I dig it
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:22:32
I don’t know anything about the android version sorry. I assume it is possible though, if you’re able to add watch-only wallets to it. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:04:42
Who calls their dad dude?

Do you not have a job? How are your wages paid? How do you pay your bills? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 01:39:30
Did you just throw some words together and hope it would make sense? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:10:12
As if I’ll listen to some dude that’s been here for less than a week lol
@_date: 2019-09-21 13:07:35
Sure, I understand. Just looked like generic phpBB forum to me so thought I’d ask. I am a rather late adopter (2017) so wasn’t aware.
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:00:50
In the early days of bitcoin talk, someone misspelled HOLD and thus the circlejerk was born
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:44:09
Hey just a little Electrum tip, keep your seed offline and run a public master key. (Watch only wallet). This means that if you do happen to get any malware, they can't steal your wallet straight from your PC. At the very least, encrypt the wallet (Can still be stolen with a keylogger though). PM me if you want more info, happy to help.
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:31:47
That’s why we have mBTC
@_date: 2019-09-30 10:25:08
Cool art style. Reminds me of cuphead
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:04:42
Who calls their dad dude? 
@_date: 2019-09-30 01:52:45
That’s not what survivorship bias is though
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:19:52
Damn and I was hoping to turn a few dollars selling my shitcoins following the fork
@_date: 2019-09-19 00:12:59
Dumb question but when they print the money, where does it go?
@_date: 2019-09-21 11:34:26
What forum is this on?
@_date: 2019-09-21 13:07:49
@_date: 2019-09-30 10:10:21
I hope so! I will buy so much!
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:58:03
Where does 6400 support come from? Why that number?
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:45:44
How's your wife feeling now? She proud of you?
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:57:27
Someone purchased a lot of bitcoin just now. This caused the price to jump very quickly as sell orders were met. The market is now self correcting
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:28:36
Yes agreed.
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:53:17
Gotcha. Best of luck. Breaking even isn't so bad. We'll be away laughing in a couple months anyway.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:32:07
This is so exciting ��
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:07:15
It’s definitely not organic growth
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:40:46
WHAT IS GOING ON
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:09:24
So much for a dump LOL
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:51:05
@_date: 2019-05-08 21:43:23
nice one!
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:08:44
I have no doubt we’ll be back at $8k shortly.
edit: called it
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:12:10
That’s your own risk. It’s just my own advice and I’m projecting. I recommend you do your own research.
@_date: 2019-05-08 07:17:23
1 of 21M coins.
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:50:48
Two weeks ago BTC was at just over $5k. How are you breaking even now at $7k?
@_date: 2019-05-06 02:57:45
I love how people are so quick to call BTC a scam. Have they forgotten the definition? 


  
So how exactly is BTC dishonest? It's the most transparent currency system in the entire world.
@_date: 2019-05-08 21:42:44
Yes absolutely! My trezor will be locked away in a vault for a long time so I'm not worried about the silly tape :) HODL on.
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:19:28
good prediction :)
@_date: 2019-05-08 11:43:53
@_date: 2019-05-08 21:44:03
I bought trezor because no one sells the Ledger in my country. Oh well
@_date: 2019-05-06 03:05:20
Well it's the same as 'investing' in a foreign currency and hoping to make more money isn't it? If I purchased $10k Australian dollars in the hope that the australian economy will do well this year, then I go and lose it, is it a scam? Same thing with Bitcoin except on a global scale.
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:45:21
[This is fine](
@_date: 2019-05-12 08:59:20
Check again ;)
@_date: 2019-05-09 18:58:18
I absolutely agree
@_date: 2018-12-10 02:36:15
Sorry for your loss my dude. This gave me physical pain to see ��
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:05:51
Thank you for your sacrifice
@_date: 2019-05-02 20:37:34
I don’t think it works like that
@_date: 2019-05-08 19:22:34
I’ll take my chances
@_date: 2019-05-18 22:17:45
Yikes. I’ve never seen anyone flaunt having bitcoin on Instagram. Who do you follow?
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:31:01
You're totally right, and I wish there was a much simpler way to explain the intricacies of BTC without going into too much detail.
