I see what you mean, but I meant that a network of centralized hubs is not the same thing as decentralization. Many users connect to hubs, and the hubs talk to each other. It is not peer-to-peer.
It is a tangentially related problem in the sense of identity and verification. Some people are working on blockchain projects related to creating "reputation" tracking. You don't need to trust that people are who they say they are, because they have a private key. Yes, you can do that with the internet now, but it requires an authority with which you have an account (at least to do it in a convenient way).

Why would Google have an interest in crypto failing? Has nothing to do with how they advertise unless we somehow achieve decentralized internet, which is a tangent from blockchain, not a direct result.

I haven't taken networking classes unfortunately. But it comes down to privacy and freedom personally. These dumb internet switches are where the NSA can log whatever they'd like unless you successfully do uncompromised end to end encryption. Separately, we've got an attack on net neutrality. Separately, we have the case of governments taking down servers for censorship or otherwise. These culminate in a desire for infrastructure that can't be shut down or interfered with.

I agree that removing actual hubs in internet structure is not feasible in our lifetimes, but I disagree strongly about the content. Blockchain platforms like ethereum already have projects supporting hosting web applications. It will be significantly more expensive and inefficient to host and edit, however. These features still seem like necessary things to research even if it doesn't make business sense yet.

How did you manage to get locked out? Didn't write down recovery?
