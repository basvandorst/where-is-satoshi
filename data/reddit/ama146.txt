To anyone wondering, yes I sold my BTC like an amatuer when it hit 1000. Talk about a missed opportunity!

I didn't lose anything, I made a smaller profit in a safer way in my opinion. I am plenty happy buying in and selling, making 1-2% every time. Any time the price is up 1-2%, I sell. Sure I lose out on potential profit, but you have to remember I am still making 1-2% every time and it adds up.

I have been playing with ~0.35BTC and have made close to $750 in the past 2 weeks day trading. And I have never done this before

I bought 10 at $200. sold at 1000$

I bought 10 Bitcoins at $205 a piece. When the price dropped from $360 down to $305 in like an hour, I sold all 10 and made a decent profit. I then decided to re-buy 3 Bitcoins with the profit I made. I plan on holding these 3 for a long time and using the profit I make off of them to add to my Bitcoin collection. 
Now I have no worries since I made all of my original investment back and am working with purely profits at this point. So much stress off my shoulders! Now it is pure enjoyment!
