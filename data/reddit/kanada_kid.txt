-Accusing CNN of being false and misleading
This should not be a surprise to anyone. CNN is absolute trash.

Bitcoin is not banned in China but from my understanding companied are banned from accepting Bitcoin for tangible goods. Financial institutions are also banned from accepting or trading Bitcoins. As of right now the currency is rather useless in China for anybody who isn't a speculator (but that seems to be what most people world over are using it for).

What would stop a country from just creating their own virtual currency?

Not pallets but I can see large amounts being transferred. This is a legit concern, why belittle it?

It wasn't created by 4chan. It was pumped by /g/. The same /g/ that told me to buy Bitcoins 2 years ago. 
Yeah I'm not making that mistake twice. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 18:34:08
 I don't agree. The ATM could be used by cartels for money laundering. In due time I expect something to be enforced.
Edit: I should know better then to question Bitcoin in this circlejerk.

Why do people pay attention to this retard and his shit network?

I'm willing to bet one whole Bitcoin that this will not happen. Heck it won't even go past 80. Its a huge exaggeration.

Chin up! There is many better reasons to be disgusted for being an American.
@_date: 2014-03-21 05:31:39
What? You made all this fuss because you misread my comment. First 6 words of my original post is "Bitcoin is NOT banned in China".
@_date: 2014-01-18 08:47:13
Where and how can I find it though?
@_date: 2014-04-24 04:54:10
I'm glad I'm not the only one to notice this.

I'd rather just use my credit card than deal with that hassle. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 09:31:06
I posted a similar complaint to yours in a couple months ago. The board has gone to shit. Full of shills, idiots and more idiots. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 09:04:20
Yeah I too remember reading how Bitcoin was going to beat the banks because... no fees! When online exchanges charge rates *worse* than a bank and have a serious possibility of getting hacked I may as well put my money into something that won't lose (or gain) up to 30% of its value in a single day.
I'm seriously losing confidence in this. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 09:36:22
Its $10 for me to send $1000 from Canada to the Philippines. If that same ATM charges me 2% that's an extra $10 I have to pay to send a very volatile currency to a relative in the Phils. I'll go with Western Union.
You are also assuming an ATM will have a 2% fee. Hint: It won't. The one in Vancouver charged 13% (I calculated it) over what the average market price was. Not including the hidden service fee they were charging. Thinking this currency will be big for people wanting to send remittance is naive. Bitcoin will have to get a lot bigger!

@_date: 2014-03-18 15:21:28

@_date: 2014-03-21 05:09:35
Yep. There is no law against mining crypto-currencies or personally selling and buying them in China.

Guys! Guys! Don't worry. If China is out lets bring in India! India can totally replace China! Oh wait. [Never mind that](
Guys! Guys! Don't worry. If India is out lets bring in Africa! Africa can totally replace India guiz. Lack of interest, 4x lower GDP and a virtually non-existent middle class? Ok. Never mind that. 
Guys! Guiz! Stopped me if you heard this one! If Africa is out lets bring in South America! Forget the fact that a lot of those countries have very strict currency controls, problems with drug cartels &amp; paramilitaries laundering money and that Colombia (one of the most capitalist friendly countries on the continent) [doesn't have very kind words for Bitcoin.](
**In all seriousness this stupid topic gets [brought]( up every time there is a crash. How about you all focus on the market that is RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES. Stop making Bitcoin a currency for hardcore tech nerds, speculators and business men. My dad doesn't know what a Bitcoin is, none of my friends know how to set up a wallet and the majority of people I know who are aware of Bitcoin (admittedly few) think it's some kind of ponzi scheme. Once these people start using Bitcoin you won't have to focus on exotic countries using Bitcoin, those countries will focus on Bitcoin.**
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:27:16
Not really.
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:44:15
Don't forget that it started off with only 70 people owning 100% of the  premined coins essentially making it a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:28:19
This may come off as ignorant (and for that I apologize) but I never met anyone from Belarus and your country really interests me. Is it true that Belarus is one of the poorest countries in Europe? How much does one need to survive there for a week? 
@_date: 2014-02-03 01:35:39
What? Your comment made little sense to me. Rephrase that. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 03:34:39
ATMs aren't really necessary (especially with the price gouging prices they charge). There are plenty of websites that will accept your fiat for Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 08:20:04
I'll give it 24 hours before its taken down!
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:28:24
It was started as a joke. Never meant as a get rich quick scheme for the devs or early dumpers. Only reason it got popular was by an unintentional stroke of genius (aka: luck). The devs had the currency go into the billions rather than millions making every early miner charitable with their coins, in turn creating the [happy-go-lucky community]( we know today.
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:08:53
Jesus he gained a lot of weight.

PoS. Its much more energy efficienct (sceypt mining uses a LOT of power) and is resilient against 51% attacks.

Cool. Keep wearing it and accusing others of fud. I bet you'll make plenty of friends around here.

Dont they still use dial up? I don't see it gaining popularity.  
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:15:35


Compared to what? A currency that will lose or gain 50% of its value in a week?
@_date: 2014-04-03 10:40:04
Responded to wrong comment. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 02:22:27
No. Its a bubble. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 09:46:46
The one near me was charging 13%. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 11:51:59
BTC China most likely has the right guanxi (aka: connections) and I bet it goes pretty high up. If not, I expect this ATM to be taken off the market quickly.  
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:25:42
You're a moron with nothing to back your argument. Consider not being a moron next time you accuse someone of spreading fud. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 23:03:59
Ah ok. The ATM now has my full support!
@_date: 2014-04-03 00:10:07
Are they confirmed to be in Bulgaria? I've heard Russia, Cyprus and even Ukraine mentioned as their home country. 
Edit: Uppps. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 03:27:06
He would say that.
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:05:51
Yes but it is still too volatile. One day hopefully it will stabilize. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:16:22
That second video incredibly accurate to my experience too. He threw a couple more middle fingers than I did though.

@_date: 2013-12-18 07:21:03
Yep. The banning in China will def set us back for awhile. The news you posted isn't too encouraging either but I see it as quite unlikely that the US will be able to ban it. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:36:34
Its not like its going to jump back up to $800 by the time you get paid.
Well this is Bitcoin...
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:06:20
Its also about the culture as well. The Chinese love to gamble. We'd be lying to ourselves if we thought that the Chinese weren't in it to make money. 
Hell, most of us on this subreddit are probably here to make money.

Just like Apple, designer labels sell their clothes at a higher price in China. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 11:52:22
Thats fine. I just don't want a coin like NXT or Mastercoin going from unknown on Monday to  on Thursday.

The dirt cheap designer clothes you were looking at were knockoffs. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 02:18:03
It should go by number of users trading the currency.

Whose fault is that? I watched the value plummet but I held my ground. If you aren't Herr to speculate you will do well.

NO IDEA! 
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:57:00


Incorrect. Those goods that are PRODUCED in China and marketed to the Chinese stay at a low price. A company like Apple may sell their products at a more expensive price in China than in the US despite being produced in China but that is due to Apple's pricing structure. Unless the Chinese plan on buying clothes/shoes/etc that are PRODUCED in another country (like the US) will they pay an inflated price. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:37:03

So really, I'll do nothing.
