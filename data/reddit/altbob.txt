Or the receiver could exchange/spend them, or keep some or all of them.

I do now when I sell a seat over the phone manually..  What I'd like to set up is a web page where someone could enter their name &amp;/or email address, select number of seats, and be presented a total (all seats are $20), &amp; a unique BTC address to send to. This way I wouldn't have to personally handle every transaction only during office hours, &amp; each customer would still get a unique address, &amp; with no 3rd party involved.
Edit - I spoke too soon.. I use Bitcoin QT, &amp; generate a new address for each transaction. I'd like this to be done on a website automatically, if possible.

Wow, thank you! I can see there is more to it than I was considering. I will have to figure out how to setup a full node first, I'm guessing.
Edit - I currently sell admission over the phone, &amp; give a new address to each customer for payment. Because I know them all and trust them, I tend to wait just long enough to see it appear (0 confirmations) before I add them to the list of attendees. I then greet everyone at the door with this list, &amp; they either have registered &amp; paid previously, or I take cash or BTC (bread wallet on phone) payment at door.  This works well, but is like to make a site that can handle because, we'll, that's less work for me... but also it can get hectic with last minute registrants.  It's actually easier at the door than over the phone in the last 24 hours just due to how much work is necessary.

Thanks for this! I will look into it. Part of the reason I'd prefer not to use a service is for privacy. I'd like the only record of any transaction, other than the blockchain of course, to be between me &amp; my customer.

Is there an app for this, by any chance?
Edit - Other than a web browser, I mean.

Are there altcoins with limited chains like that?

How vulnerable would Bitcoin (or an altcoin) be hypothetically if it only stored the last 100,000 blocks in the chain?  Would this mean one would have to move their funds approx every 20 months, or lose record of them?

is what you're proposing [something that would enable this?](
