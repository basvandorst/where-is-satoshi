Wasn't a gamble, this is a site that is holding my money hostage for no reason. I made $10k from the $5k I initially invested and was in the process of cashing some of it out when they fucked me over.

I was selling some Stratis so I was forced to use an exchange, unfortunately I chose poloniex

Tier 1 but I think I applied for Tier 2 and of course it was pending

They don't allow you to withdraw more than 2k a day so I went to withdraw 2k and my whole account was locked with $15k in it. You're right though, my fault for withdrawing my fucking money?

Hey Mike, can you help me access my $15,000 that has been locked for over 30 days? 
Ticket:

not true, my friend has 300,000 in her account that has been locked for over 2 months with no reply
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:13:47
it's not lol, not sure why you're making up random amounts

When was this? I thought about doing it but they are so backlogged I don't know if they would even see them.

Are you mentally ill? Poloniex doesn't let you withdraw more than 2k a day so it's impossible to even request a 15k withdrawal in the first place. I went to withdraw 2k and my account THAT HAS 15k IN IT was locked.

I'd love to verify myself as tier 2 but poloniex doesn't reply. I had my account locked for 30 days then after making a lot of noise on reddit I get my account 'unlocked' only to find my account stuck on the profile page and when I entered my info in again I've just been sitting here on pending for 5 days.
