Depending on exactly what you mean, you could be doing it wrong.  Very wrong.    As in "all your money could disappear" wrong.
When you buy BTC, unless you are planning on selling or spending them immediately (in the next couple of days) then you should transfer them into a wallet that you control.   BTC left on an exchange are not under your control.    You are taking a huge and totally unnecessary risk by leaving your money in an exchange wallet.   That didn't work out too well for the people who did that at MtGox.

The Bitcoin market is small and very volatile, even without manipulation.   Hopefully people realize that before they "invest" or "speculate" in it.
However, show me something that ISN'T volatile and/or being manipulated.     Where are you going to go?  Cash?   Stocks?   Ever here of the FED?    How much value has the dollar lost in the last 5/10/50 years?  
If you are fleeing volatility, then yes you can find something that is much less volatile... which also has much less upside... than Bitcoin.   Best of luck to you.    But if you are fleeing manipulation, you really need to take a closer look at... well... literally everything.    Even the cash you stuff under your mattress is being manipulated.  Heavily.
Or maybe manipulation by government entities is okay with you.

After all this "discussion" it appears the answer to the question is "Nobody knows, but Bitcoin does this sometimes so don't sweat it."   
Sometimes people can pin violent market swings to an announcement or development somewhere in the world, or the entrance (or exit) of a large amount of fiat into/out of the market.    This doesn't appear to be one of those times.

The real "true believers" wouldn't have had any losses at Mt. Gox.  They knew better.   They also know that the protocol remains revolutionary regardless of what happens to a single currency exchange.

I think there is a part missing from option 3:   Do not trust anyone with your bitcoin.
An exchange is just that... an exchange.   The only reason to keep BTC in a wallet at an exchange is if you are a constantly trading.     Most people aren't doing that, and a lot of those that are probably shouldn't be.
So after you find an exchange that does all the right things with your BTC and lets you see the books... don't trust them any more than you absolutely have to.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:46:56
They can, but this would be an incredibly bad thing to do.  We never want to set that precedent.  Ever.   What if next time, the IRS wants to invalidate YOUR bitcoins because you didn't pay enough tax?

Imagine if TMZ could tell what went into and out of any bank account, but they couldn't tell if any particular bank account was yours or not.    Given time, maybe they could figure it out, but...
NOW imagine you could change your bank account number and start using a new one whenever you damn well felt like it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:50:50
As a bitcoin user, the safety of your BTC is entirely up to you.    Understanding counterparty risk and exercising due diligence could have prevented most, if not all, of the losses from MtGox.  Those are sufficient safety precautions for a lot of people.  If you aren't one of those people then maybe you should just sit this opportunity out until the situation changes.
That being said, one of the things that exchanges will have to do going forward is provide better security and transparency.  Some are already moving in that direction.  Maybe those changes will make you feel more comfortable.
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:27:14
Sure.  People decide on a course of action, usually driven by emotion, and then they come up with reasons and excuses whey the advice and warnings of other people don't apply to their "unique" situation.   
This behavior is not unique to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-02 04:36:40
Not only would it not work, but the very idea is a stake to the heart of what makes Bitcoin what it is.
So this makes the third time I've seen this idea (or a similar one) pop up like poison ivy.     Do you people even understand what makes Bitcoin valuable?      If you're going to embrace the concept of third parties snatching money out of people's wallets or placing roadblocks between them and the use of their money, then why did you even buy Bitcoin in the first place?    You already have that with the current monetary system.   Go back to that.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:54:24
Why did you buy BTC?
Have any of the reasons you bought BTC changed?
If not, you should be buying, not selling.
If so... maybe you bought for the wrong reasons.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:23:03
This is a terrible, terrible idea.   This is an apocalyptic level of bad.   Doing this would be worse than every exchange going Gox simultaneously.   Anyone who suggests this is missing an understanding of the core concepts if Bitcoin itself.   The fact that this is the second time I've seen this in a few hours is very disturbing.

@_date: 2014-02-25 14:29:47
Trust is not binary.  It isn't an all or nothing, on or off decision.  You need to decide just how much you are willing to trust an exchange and take steps to not exceed that  limit.  Trusting an exchange to hold $500 just long enough for you to buy BTC and immediately transfer the BTC out is a far cry from trusting them to hold thousands of dollars of BTC indefinitely.

Amateur Hour is never over.   There are always more amateurs.  There are always more people who will put money into technologies, markets, and businesses that they don't understand and can't be bothered to research.

...which should be done as soon as possible.  That's all I'm saying.   Leaving any amount in an exchange's wallet is an unnecessary counterparty risk that most people don't need to take.

Caveat:   I don't know the details of your situation, so the advice I give may not be ideal, or even usable depending on what you're doing and what country you're in.   That being said, I've got two suggestions, depending on how big of a hurry you're in and how  much time/effort you want to spend:
1)  If I knew very little about bitcoin and needed to create an address and start accepting payments, i would either go to coinbase.com or blockchain.info and create an account.   Please use 2-Factor authentication on the account AND on whatever email account you associate with it (if possible).    Take one of the addresses in  your new web-wallet and start spreading it around.   Then immediately set up an account at coinbase (assuming you didn't create the wallet there in the first place) and connect it to a bank account so that you can sell to fiat.  While you're at it, maybe create an account at gyft so you can buy gift cards without going through the banking system, which might take a few days for each conversion from BTC to USD.   This is the "quick and dirty" method, but this probably isn't the method more knowledgeable people would use.  
2)   What I would personally do is go to bitaddress.org and create/print some paper wallets.   NOTE that there is much more to doing this correctly than just going to the website and hitting print.   The FAQs that you may have read should explain the real way it is done.    Then, for cashing out, I would create accounts at multiple exchanges (coinbase, bitstamp, cryptsy) as well as both gyft and purse.io for purchasing gift cards and amazon goods, respectively.  Take the public address for one of those paper wallets and use it as a donation address.      Use mycellium (a free Android wallet available in the play store) on a spare phone or other softare on some sort of non-windows computer to do the transactions.      Again, doing this securely involves work and understanding. See the FAQs.   Use mycellium and/or localbitcoins.com to facilitate selling bitcoins for cash in face-to-face exchanges in your area, if needed.
Good luck.

First, don't store large amounts of bitcoin on a mobile device.   You shouldn't be doing this anyway, backdoor or not.   How much government currency do you have in your physical wallet at one time?   You shouldn't have more than that amount of bitcoin in your phone wallet.   It's  "spending money" or "pocket change", not a savings or checking account.   It somebody wants to hack the $20 worth of BTC out of my phone wallet, I'll be pissed but it isn't a life-changing event.  
The REAL problem comes with Google Authenticator.   If someone gets hold of those codes, then you could be screwed out of a lot more than pocket change... like your entire online identify, for example.    However, even with this backdoor, I'd still say that using 2FA is more secure than NOT using 2FA.  So far.

If the Bitcoin developers, under pressure from government(s) or the Bitcoin community itself, begin to do things to the protocol that violate the core principles of the original design.    
This could be any number of things.   The idea of "tainted" coins comes to mine.    Any such idea of a whitelist/blacklist of addresses that is written into the code rather than just enforced from the outside by laws (and thus easily ignored).    Just today I've twice seen people on reddit suggesting a hard fork of the blockchain to invalidate the coins that were stolen/lost from MtGox.      If something like were to happen, I'd be out in an angry heartbeat.
Just why I'd consider such a thing to be a showstopper is a long discussion that I'm not sure you're interested in, but you have the answer to your question.

Steve Gibson devoted an episode to it on "Security  Now" (Episode 287, Feb 2011    )
I can't say if this is the first time I heard the word "bitcoin", but this was definitely when I became interested in it.    Prior to this, any mention of "bitcoin" (if any) was just background noise.
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:14:07
It's a terrible idea.   This violates core concepts of what Bitcoin is.   
Could it be done?  In theory, yes.  But you'd have to convince the miners to do it and THEN you'd have to convince the users not to abandon Bitcoin for the next-best cryptocurrency that is actually fungible... the way BTC is supposed to be.   Good luck with both of those.
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:53:24
Do it.    It is not a best scenario by any means,  but it definitely adds utility to the bitcoin sphere, and I would almost certainly use it until/unless the merchants I use most often start accepting BTC directly.
That being said, you should go into it with the knowledge that what is good for BTC (more merchants accepting it directly) would be bad for your bottom line.    So have other plans.
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:17:00

I bought this thing.   It was waaay more complicated than I thought it should be, although i admit that 99% of it was due to my own paranoia.   Still:
1.  Did some research to figure out WTF to do. It's not I can go to iTunes and buy it there with bitcoin (yet).    An association with cloudhashing, eh?  Okay.
2.  Launch the bitcoin client containing my pocket-change on my machine, because I don't run with it open.  It takes a while to open because ???.   Meanwhile...
3.  Went to the MelB site.   Enabled javascript on her site AND on cloudhashing.com, because fuck scripting/trust no one.
4.  Click the link to buy.   End up on bitpay site with some odd errors.   I didn't enable scripting on bitpay.  Fuck.
5.  Hit the back button, go to bitpay in another tab and enable scripting on that site because fuck scripting/trust no one.
6.  Click the buy button again.   See the big-ass QR code, but I'm not using a phone to pay.    I see the link that should pop the address over to my desktop client. I can just click on that- oh, shit, my browser is in a sandbox (Trust NO ONE!) and my bitcoin client is not.  Will that work?  I'd better not try it.    Display the address instead and copy it.
7.  Bitcoin client is still not open.  Wait.
8.  Wait.
9.  Wait.
10.  Ah, here it is... huh?   Client blockchain is 26 hours behind even though I had it open THIS MORNING.   WTF?  ...whatever, it's syncing.  It's a bit slow because of the VPN.  Shut up.  Meanwhile, the Bitpay screen has this timer on it that's counting down.  Presumably the transaction/address/price will be invalid when it expires.
I enter the transaction in the client, which requires a fee.   I pay it like a good citizen.
11.  Nothing happens.   Wait... does the client have to be current on the blockchain sync before the transaction goes through?    (still don't know the answer to that one).  What will happen if the bitpay timer expires before the client finishes syncing?    I hope I'm  not about to find out.  It's a RACE AGAINST TIME!  I'm buying an mp3 I don't even want and it fees like the last two chapters of a goddamn Michael Crichton novel!    The sync finishes in a few minutes with lots of time left on the Bitpay clock.
12.  Click the link to download the MP3, and listen to it while I'm writing this.
13.  Meh.   I'd still hit it, though.    Hope she makes a lot of bitcoins.
