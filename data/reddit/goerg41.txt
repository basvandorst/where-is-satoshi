Its available. Just make sure its "sold by" and "shipped by" Newegg.

I have yet to get a straight response from a rep there but a few users have mentioned that their end cost results in a 5-7 percent premium over avg spot.  Also you need to sign up and fill in personal info before getting access to list price.

 "its tens of registered users? "
I don't mean to find humor where it was unintended but is this accurate?  My sense of humor really requires work.

There's no hard fast rules imo if you use BTC for remittances.  You know what it offers and at certain times, its value will stand out.  Bitcoins having value because it "is" being used.  It has value from people that choose to use it however they prefer provides them value over other similar options.  Since you are inquiring about the BTC payment system though, as long as you know how it works, it is valuable.  You can use the BTC payment system for the following reasons or not:  Someone needs the payment to settle relatively quickly and surely (for a small fee), the amount your sending relative to what you perceive to be volatility is worth it. (For example, you want to send 1000 dollars that will cost 40 in wire fees, vs sending via BTC with some cost in the form of volatility in your perspective.  IMHO, there is a sweet spot for everyone, and for myself, the sweet spot is wide.  Also keep in mind that if you're in the us, you'll be able to cap volatility using the coming futures by bakkt particularly if you're sending the amounts you are suggesting.  There are other options such as using Kraken exchange to hedge which is cheap and reliable as they offer shorting on margin already for US users.  What is valuable to lots of people that are using BTC regularly already is that its all very much at your disposal and at your own control and it works reliably once you get your toes wet.  Its not just a saying when they say be your own bank.  Also, "hodling" on blind faith may work for some, but if you've used BTC in its various offerings its difficult to not appreciate it how it works.  That being said, its just another option that sometimes will have more value to you, sometimes less.   Ironing out the cost-benefit will help you decide to use it or not over the other options available.  The most vital factor is that it works.  It would be a different matter if it doesn't.    Aside from that, all the costs are open for you to examine.

I think BullBitoin might be what you're looking for.  Also their rates are competitive and straight forward.

just curious why someone would use this vs bitvo cash card who charges 1 percent load fee.   Particularly if kyc/aml is no issue.  It says they have a 15 dollar minimum but at three hundred dollars load and better, they would be the better option.  Just interested in case there is another advantage.

I remember reading about this when I had the same issue when testing the wallet but I haven't tried it.  Maybe this will help or hopefully lead you to the answer you're looking for. GL

i think Fincen is Us.  CA would be California.

Just curious.  As a vender, what kind of benefits come from accepting this form of payment over others that would encourage others to do the same.  Just from a business pov do you find it manageable risk wise?

Just a brief reading under the CEA, as mentioned in the case files:
Quote: 
Multiple statements defining virtual currency as a commodity have been issued by the CFTC.
App. B,
CFTC Primer 
at 11 (“The
 
definition of ‘commodity’
 in the CEA is broad . . . It can mean physical commodity, such as an agricultural product . . . It can mean currency or
interest rate.”);
CFTC Launches Virtual Currency Resource Web Page

20 Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The [CFTC] primarily regulates commodity derivatives contracts that are based on underlying commodities.

So, a commodity can be "an interest rate" " a currency"

Thank you.  I think I see what is in there which I missed as result of my excitement.  Which is "create prop based  cyrpto  benchmarks".  
Hopefully their "concurrently with establishment of brokerage services"  means they will be offering both new trading instruments 
 or measures and access to actual.

Here's  a bit more substance to this piece.  It does sound like its is offering exposure to spot and not a derivative product.  
Do you mind sharing where you see this part about derivative?  
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:38:13
I just read that article.  Would you mind clarifying a bit what is being brokered?  Is it just a fancy ticker and comprises of prop algoes and access to otc market places price?  Not to be too picky but the article sounds quite flashy, but hard to grasp what they will actually be doing. 
They will be aggregating price from good sources, then taking this price and letting other people derive products from it?  
Thank you for link.

The above posted link is from coinatmradar.    I'm not affiliated with any btm companies or the site but I check sometimes to see what is happening with these niche operators.  
If you're in Greater Vancouver there appear to be enough offerings with quoted service between the 4 and 6 percent rate.  The GTA has a good number that offer even more compressed rates but this is based off of the web numbers.  
I haven't used them so not sure how reliable the site is.  Also, it would be great to have a site that has simple data like what is the offered rate and then what is the service fee if any.  From the site I posted, its hard to tell since the information in not consistent from operator to operator.

I do think that's a bit of why it turns somewhat so many things on its head.  Its not that there is no C suite of individuals.  There may be, but they are anon, or decentralized.  A lot of your argument is predicated on there being no locatable or identifiable nucleus of ownership or "shareholder", if there is one. In my simple understanding of corporate structures, bitcoin and its structure really possesses aspects of this in some form very specifically.   
You are investing in a decentralized company where the founder is unknown, or in this case is anon and the sales pitch is that your shares are money, easily transferable, can be used as currency.  
Not to be silly, which I am a lot, but going from your first two paragraphs to "none of these qualities" is quite a leap imho.  
I do think this is why the technology is revolutionary.  It dashes a lot of what institutions use as "words"  to understand and take away power and forces them to rethink.  In the process, power switches hands because the word no longer belongs to them.
