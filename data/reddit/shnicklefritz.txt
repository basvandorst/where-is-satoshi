What I don't seem to understand is if someone uses the same seed as you (however unlikely), they would generate the same address and key as you. Would they then use this wallet? Even if you change your private key, they would generate the same address and attempt to use that wallet. I realize that this is incredibly unlikely, I'm just asking if this would be possible or if I've missed a step somewhere

Can this still be considered anonymous (since the original wallet is tied to your name), or is that not a concern for you?
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:06:54
Sounds great, thank you :)

I understand that. I wish I could buy instantly, but I have no interest in a credit card. Buying local also seems to be more expensive, so I don't mind a few day's wait

Do you just send bitcoin straight from coinbase to your cold wallet?

Got it. Thank you for your reply!
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:08:30
Commenting so I can find later. Thanks for all the info :)

Thanks for the reply :)
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:06:11
Love 'em, especially on my charts ;)
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:05:29
Awesome, thanks!

Oh of course. What's the purpose of a dollar if no one is spending it? Spending seems to be pretty easy now that so many places are accepting bitcoin (though I'm still trying to fully grasp the hot spending wallet and cold storage wallet phenomenon). Let me know what you end up getting!

I do not. I have .wallet, .info, .properties, .checkpoints, and .spvchain

3 weeks, still waiting to be verified, no word from support

There's a lot of talk about it on the net, this sub included. Talk = fear, fear = sell, sell = drop
Just my guess though

Hey don't discourage panics. I like my discount coins
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:28:25
Might be Segwit and hard fork

Still waiting on Gemini's verification after 3 weeks. Any other exchanges I should try?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:31:51
I'll try that, thanks friend. To the moon
