They could’ve used those $2 on so much more

Well that gold is going to drop 5% in value by the time they get to their destination �� in all jokes, I love crypto 
@_date: 2018-05-04 02:18:00
Well there is no cost for the banks because they can always pull money out of their ass.

"Wtf why is $100 worth of bitcoin funny?"
@_date: 2018-05-18 06:18:54
It's psychological. We want approval so bad from the people that disapproved us. It's like trying to show off in front of a hot girl that turned you down in the fifth grade lol.
@_date: 2018-05-08 21:03:52
Maybe mcafee was right 
@_date: 2018-05-01 20:23:49
I fear that the banks will buy all the bitcoin just to destroy it 
@_date: 2018-05-05 05:49:15
I like that 
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:47:30
I really don't think that bitcoin will be measured in satoshi in the future. I just can't see a bunch of Americans saying satoshi on a normal basis. But I do look forward to the day when u can buy stuff for one satoshi.

Not sure if you can read.. but ok

Do the anti-BTC enthusiasts even know that the Federal Reserve is a privately owned company that earns dividends of 6%? And only banks get to own the stocks of this private company. But what do I know? Maybe BTC is too much of a greed investment that won't work because it could leave the unemployed poor.

If you call warren buffet a YouTube ad, sure. Do some research
@_date: 2018-06-13 00:52:42
 if bitcoin's price shoots up without a technical confirmation I'm gonna lose my shit
@_date: 2019-08-29 13:56:38
As you said pretty worthless

Vitalik is saying a million transactions a second will be possible for ETH. We will see what happens.
@_date: 2019-08-29 13:55:22
No they won’t. It’s a lot scarier to buy bitcoin at 3000 than at 9000. Because no one else has enough balls to even if it happens again and a again
@_date: 2018-06-22 05:08:26
Why not just.... name GDAX coinbase pro. Or is that what they're doing?
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:03:30
So is there a point where China can be like... ok, US, we would like our 3 trillion dollars now.
@_date: 2019-08-29 22:18:37
I bet you wouldn’t if it came down to 1k lol. Then you would have doubts. I wouldn’t buy at 1k either unless I was very sure it was starting to become bullish

Some top investors advise against diversification, saying it is better to find 3 promising investments with great research  than 30 basic investments with less research.

He was on crack when he said that 
@_date: 2019-06-08 04:44:46
Pretty good. Thanks for asking.
@_date: 2019-12-26 17:29:49
That’s a stupid way of thinking
@_date: 2019-04-04 13:27:26
Yea. But no one will believe it until it happens
@_date: 2018-11-28 14:29:57
This is not related to bitcoin lol 
@_date: 2018-11-07 15:14:25
Now dump eet

That's some good tech. Way to go BTC team.
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:22:36
I remember getting rekt taking signals haha. But I don’t post bullshit analysis because that wouldn’t benefit me in any way since I’m not a major holder of bitcoin in any way. Signal groups pumping shitcoins? Not a good idea. and I make sure the odds are in my favor every time.

Carlos Matos's wife made him a BITCONNECT cake
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:21:02
Thank you hater. You know what I said that day was true, for day traders as I clearly stated. Not 10 year investors.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:26:51
Good idea

Bitcoin data showing bearish beginning
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:12:49
Oh I wish. I would put all my money on it if it were that lol. But this is simply technical analysis I have put together. But I’ll tell you this, most of what you hear is bullshit. All these support resistance, RSI bullshit posts are fucking bullshit. People who use them lose in the long term. If you use what the majority uses you will lose.
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:14:20
If I am right I will delete this post after and not post another prediction. If I am wrong, I will update my prediction before bitcoin does something too crazy and then delete the post.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:30:09
Well you know I was right. It happened. Now I’m on the other side. I’m not married to being long or short.
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:19:08
Thanks for diving deep in my posts. And they are not magical indicators. The important ones aren’t indicators at all. Don’t believe me
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:08:53
Haha but there is a way. Crossing your fingers TA won’t do you good
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:17:35
I have no idea about it’s true value. if you are a hodler I guess it doesn’t matter. But this post is more for the day traders and people trying to make money. All I know for sure right now is that bulls are weak. In a few days I will know if sellers have taken over officially or not.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:58:24
Then just observe.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:19:15
Then go long. I will update you in a few days when I’m more sure. Then I will tell you. If you don’t listen then oh well lol.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:52:23
And you are the next Warren Buffett
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:28:31
Still bullish to me.  However, not as bullish as it was from the past week an a half. Might be dying down in the upcoming week but still bullish for now.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:12:42
Right and it’s not healthy how people are predicting huge prices already. Not saying it won’t hit those prices however we are in a bad mindset as a community
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:38:41
No problem thank you for believing in my work
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:48:54
Well I had a few people that thanked me and messaged me after the flash crash. Also you need better insults my man. You get them from alphamales.com?
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:21:35
I gain two things from this and I have to say I really appreciate your way of thinking and how you put this question together.
1) I save people from a likely pullback  and WILL STILL inform if bitcoin decides not to pullback at least by a weeks time.
2) I prove to myself that I know my shit, and that will make all my work worthwhile
I don’t share how I know because life isn’t easy and spoon feeding people isn’t a smart idea in the long term.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:21:36
Oh I see a hodler. Then this post doesn’t really mean shit to you. I don’t know that far into the future but I wish you good luck.
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:26:13
Will... will there be free wifi?
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:13:24
Haha! Hope you made some money today.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:11:38
Good on you my man. I’m serious about this as well this is not another “price prediction”. I will update this post in a few days and I’ll be more certain then.
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:33:55
Because I used my strategy which is private.
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:01:35
do more like in two weeks. I predict it’s start in 2-7 days. Not the whole move.
