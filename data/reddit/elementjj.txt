Listen to the other post. I don't know your circumstances, but that's a really bad way of financing yourself. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:50:46
If you use a wallet that lets you set your own fees, you should get away with 70-100 sat/b and have it confirmed within a day or 2. Use a wallet which allows replace by fee just in case.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:36:31
That's what I've used so far, but it would be nice to have some TX to test everything after address derivation.
So far I found some 3xxxx addresses that I hardcoded but not possible on my live app.

Just restore it in Electrum with the seed.

I want to add it to my App for iOS BTC Watch. Is your segwit public extended key in the form xpub? Or ypub/zpub?
I think I can do it with xpub and bip49 derivation. I will test it. Check out my app also, much better than arcbit ;) I made it because I thought the current set of apps looked really bad, can't show that to my friends!
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:14:45
An xpub (extended public key) is used by a HD Wallet to derive/find the public addresses associated to a certain wallet.
A HD Wallet is not a key so isn't comparable to a xpub address. It uses a seed to generate an extended private key (xpriv), that generates the private/public keys for a wallet.
BIP32 defines the process of how a HD Wallet actually creates the addresses from a seed.

@_date: 2018-01-06 23:40:49
Nope, ypub just to watch a wallet. My app just derives addresses from a ypub/xpub and tells you the balance/profit etc. Like blockfolio but automatic. You can't send money with an extended public key.
My apps per TX (per address) profit calculation is only accurate if you move your BTC straight from the exchange to an address ASAP.
So any ypub that had TX made against its derived segwit addresses.
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:18:41
You missed the point. Why convert to dollars or euros at all... do you convert your local currency to Zimbabwean dollars all the time too? No, because you've become used to the value of your money, e.g. By comparing the cost to your salary. When you get paid in BTC, it'll just be the same. There is already a BIP to start using "bits" as the default denomination.
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:09:04
Send it to GDAX. Install Revolut on phone. Send EUR to Revolut Euro account. Convert EUR to GBP in Revolut. Transfer GBP to bank.
Or did you already sell the BTC for GBP?
I top up Revolut with gbp, convert to euro, send to GDAX, buy BTC, send BTC to wallet for FREE.
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:57:55
Nice, what's the general consensus on the mempool size dropping? Have TX numbers dropped?
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:23:41
You need to add it on BitWallet then set address derivation to segwit. There is some text about trezor written there.
It seems that it uses the xpub key (starts with xpub) but uses bip49 format to derive the address. Another scenario to work on for me then...

With the private key of that address you can recover the bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:09:27
I think bitWallet on iOS App Store can do it.
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:01:10
Ive never used a ledger, but the basis of this process requires you to obtain a receive address from your wallet and tell GDAX to send BTC to that address. 
So you find the RX (receive) address in ledger, go to GDAX, click withdraw - BTC, paste the BTC RX address that you got from your ledger wallet. Send.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:04:00
If you wore money, it's your banks job to make sure it arrives, at least in the UK. They can easily reverse a SEPA transfer.
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:11:33
There aren't many obj c/swift libraries that support segwit. Corebitcoin is used by BitWallet on iOS and it supports segwit. If they aren't using that lib already it's somewhat of a rewrite.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:10:29
You deleted account 0. You need to put the account number as 1 in the import wizard.

Yeah, working on it!! There really isn't much support :( And thanks for trying it, you can try your old xpub to see what it does.

Takes 2 days when I do it via Revolut.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:23:34
You'll run it offline so even if it had been tampered with, how would the data get out? Also the ISO will have a checksum.
Not run it myself for a while but it probably mounts all disk drives, so ideally you run it on a machine that has no disk drives installed.

I use Revolut, I lose about 10£ on £1000 conversion.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:14:31
Not really as they aren't getting processed as genuine TXs pay more fee for priority. Then these spam TX get dumped out the mempool after some days (14 I think).
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:15:34
You are better off converting to euro in Revolut and sending to GDAX. Then place a limit order. This way you'll pay almost 0 fees.  Since BTC price tanked, you can actually do this with about 100£.
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:51:44
Try Cryptopia
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:20:27
How are you sure they are being confirmed? Not sure what you meant by the latter part of your post. If they spam at 100 sat/b, then genuine TXs will use more than that fee to have their TX confirmed faster or a better chance of it being mined over spam.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:13:11

No I haven't used testnet. But I understand the privacy concern. There is at least 1 xpub that I used for testing, but nothing for ypub :(
This was just a pet project, but I had lots of comments to add segwit support once it hit the AppStore.
I'm pretty sure it'll work though, would be nice to confirm.
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:03:06
BTC really doesn't offer privacy. It's a public ledger, you can use other means and BTC to try to anonymise the TX, but the coins can be traced back, that is what a ledger does. Use Monero in your chain if you want real privacy, but that too requires some internet sense to truly anonymise.
There is a notion of dirty BTC, but miners decide on if that's actually going to have any effect. Miners mined the WannaCry ransom ware BTC and then allowed conversion up Monero. Everyone knew those addresses were "dirty". But miners mine what comes with a fee.

Your missing the point. I buy all my BTC via Revolut to convert GBP to Eur and send to GDAX. I pay 0 fees on buying BTC this way. Then I sell BTC and transfer the euros to Revolut and convert to GBP. Then bank transfer that to my card. Nobody uses the crypto feature in Revolut!!

Hmm, does your xpub start with "xpub" or "ypub"?
I also updated my app to work with ypub bip49 format.
I'm not aware of a segwit enabled xpub that starts with "xpub", afaik it's "ypub" or "zpub".
In BitWallet chose the wallet structure as m/0/k if it's a "ypub".

@_date: 2018-01-06 23:46:08
My app takes a ypub, derives the segwit addresses and checks their balance. It also adds up the balance of each address that was used. If I use a new ypub with 0 TXs, my app won't list any TXs... So it's hard to say if it all worked, except validating that the correct TX addresses were actually derived (which they are).
So really I just need a ypub which has an address that was used once at least. Then my app can get its balance and show some stats for that TX address.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:12:33
I don't know how that works then :(
There are way too many combinations at this rate.
For ypub I just hit blockonmics api.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:10:01
Could start with just importing the seed into Electrum.  Then send to a HW wallet. That way you can at least set your fee.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:44:30

@_date: 2017-12-31 00:24:46
What has this got to do with the old private keys? If you move all the BTC from paper wallet to a HD Wallet, then all your funds are accessible going forwards using the seed. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:59:59
Nope, if you lose the private key, it's gone forever.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:25:50
GDAX pay the fee for you as they want to promote day traders. My fee a few days back was paid at 500 sat/byte. That's the only reason these TX get confirmed fast.
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:10:35
Wrong, the exchange buy BTC in advance and keep it as credit. Each GDAX account is just an off chain TX that takes BTC from the credit the exchange hold. Then only when you withdraw the BTC to a wallet does the money leave the GDAX bitcoin wallet to your wallet. Day traders or bots are not withdrawing to a wallet so this is all off chain.
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:32:52

You seem to be referring to blockchain, not bitcoin. Blockchain is the tech, bitcoin is one of many implementations. And right now it's implementation is facing high fees, which is problematic when there are other implementations that don't have this problem.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:31:52
Yes that's what customers say. There are a ton of problems. Scaling/fees/public ledger/immutability are all problems and only sometimes positives. Most businesses would want private blockchains due to this. Some consider hybrid, database with large amounts of data and a blockchain that is a pointer to this data. 
Identity in a blockchain is what interests me most. 
The problem lies mostly in the fact that the companies who have the budgets and talent to build a disruptive use case simply haven't since their business model is profitable without dealing with all these new issues, including new legal issues with a blockchain approach. I have seen dev teams struggle in companies because although they build useful things, the stakeholders cannot simply switch to it due to tons of other issues like regulation, new auditing processes etc... the world isn't ready just yet.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:04:19
The 2nd address in that blockchain.info link is your change address. The 5.6-(amount sent to exchange) will end up in that change address. It should still be in your wallet.

@_date: 2017-12-23 23:30:26
If you just log into GDAX and deposit BTC from Coinbase then send to a BTC address it's completely FREE!
It's actually insane how many times it's been said already on this sub and people continue to fall into this trap.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:41:21
But you can get the private keys from the seed. You just don't need to, let the software do that bit, but technically you can do it yourself. Therefore it's not the same as leaving BTC on an exchange.
The reason is because each address will have a private key, so you'll end up with quite a few, hence you use a seed to be able to generate them all in one go.
Having the seed is equivalent of having the private key/s.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:08:14
I use mycelium, but it's not perfect, like for example it won't let me fully withdraw... but it's compatible with Electrum, so I pop my seed on Electrum if I really want to move a big amount to sell off.
Then I put the xpub key from mycelium into BTC Watch (an app I put on the App Store) to watch my balance/transactions growth.

You just use the seed on the new phone. Don't see an issue here.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:31:59
Why would you lose funds? The wallets tell you to save the seed, and ask you to enter it to validate you stored it safely. You put the seed in your safe deposit box. You move the BTC from paper wallet to HD wallet. 
You burn the paper wallet.
You burn the phone.
Want to spend the money - you need to load the seed into the software wallet on a new phone.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:23:17
It's free on GDAX to buy BTC and withdraw BTC though...

GDAX for 0 fees.

They make too much money, that's all it tells me. Lots of Coinbase users actually pay..
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:44:02
My iOS App BTC Watch does this.
I use the extended public key to get TX data. Then get the price at the time the address was used (assuming each address is used once as part of a HD Wallet). From there I calculate it's current value and provide a percent profit/loss per TX.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:12:32
The internet is to email as blockchain is to bitcoin. It's just one use/implementation.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:34:06
Exactly, I've asked on the nbitcoin creators' support channel if there is a way. For non segwit it's one line of code! Soon as I get segwit in my app, I'll move to a segwit addresses myself, and I'm sure that'll cause a huge uptake in segwit if other devs can incorporate it easily - which will be great for the BTC blockchain in its entirety.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:07:19
GDAX and Coinbase share the same login info as they are part of the same company. So you either have an account at both or neither.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:48:48
Hm that's a good idea. Complicated though since my app just accepts one extended public key. Plus i would need a way to ignore the first address on the segwit wallet and instead get metadata from the original wallet. But all other addresses should be treated as normal in for the segwit wallet. A bit messy for average users to use. 
Now to figure out how to generate the receive addresses from zpub and ypub keys.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:33:09
How unfortunate.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:41:32
Since my friend is in a different country, I am just planning on giving her the public key. And if she wants to withdraw I'll just do it for her. She can just hodl and watch it double :) This way it's simple.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:28:30
Just send the EUR to GDAX then make a limit order for free. It's almost 0 fee if you do it right. It's costly if you want instant BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:45:00
This started before the dip. Maybe the last week or 2 it's been a fee frenzy.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:18:26
You can use my iOS App called BTC Watch. But you need to move your BTC to your private wallet for it to automatically calculate your profits on each transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:36:14
I'm not interested in discussing who will win or dot com boom. I just came here to explain my thoughts on an analogy.
Try to use HTTP against a site that's only listening on port 443 HTTPS. It will fail. The protocols all share the use of the internet, but each one has its use and are not always cross compatible. Sometimes it's preferable to use one protocol over another, or you just have to. *Similar* to how you can't use a BTC wallet to lookup your ETH balance.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:28:23
Imo just because the protocols can be changed by each implementation of blockchain doesn't mean that the core principals do, and that's why I explain it as being the internet or the platform.
Yes, each coin has it's own protocol, and yes, that technically makes it the "internet" equivalent. But if we put that to the side it's a simpler analogy, they all share the idea of a blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:27:16
Probably they work on bch since that'll make more money than what the lose on segwit. Could be lots of similar reasons.

I think at this point most, or at least me, are simply not moving BTC, unless it's from the exchange to a wallet.

Withdrawing BTC from GDAX to a BTC address incurs no fee.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:31:47
It's a very popular wallet on pc. Probably not the only wallet which lets you set fees. You can have your wallet in both mycelium and Electrum and slender from either this way. All you need to do is select bip39 in Electrum when importing your 12 word seed. No harm in testing this.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:54:38
If it's BTC it's going to take 5+ hrs. GDAX batches are being committed very slowly/delayed.
Better to use ETH or LTC to buy altcoins.

No probs. This is why you should not hodl coins at the exchange. If their database is hacked you could lose everything.

Try do the id on a pc. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:24:55
It's an easy way to test things.
Generally people use an exchange like GDAX, which doesn't charge any fees (almost 0%). Your Coinbase account can be used at GDAX, same company.
You can buy it with credit card at Coinbase, send coin to GDAX for free, withdraw coin to wallet from GDAX free for a similar experience. I do that plus actually buy coin on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:51:26
Nope, just BTC since it's expecting the use of the BTC wallet extended public key (xpub, non segwit). Working on segwit support now.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:21:35
Coinbase is a simple app/site to buy coins. You can just buy it directly from your credit card. But the convenience comes at a price, they charge a fee to buy coins and a fee to send them to your bitcoin wallet (not required but highly advised).
So we generally never recommend this approach.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:23:02
To me, yes. Makes perfect sense. To my parents, no ;)
And to customers when I pitch the use of blockchain, nope.

Not really, I know an energy company looking to build a solution for realtime energy billing with connected usage meters running on a blockchain. They are looking at ETH to use smart contracts to do this. But they are struggling with all the problems I mentioned.
ICOs will come and go. BTC won't die off, but sometimes people can be confused when we talk about LN, and the current reputation for BTC is very sticky, high fees/slow TX times. BTC does seem to be frankensteined at times, but more due to its longer lifetime, it's hard to explain BIP to companies.
BTC has a fairly narrow use case in comparison to ETH, just currency - but of course has its own purpose. BTC has the right exposure to become mainstream however.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:18:51

For once, Coinbase? Although might cost nearly that much to withdraw lol.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:16:52
Instant? I think the slowest part is Coinbase processing the payment into the relevant reference id. I had Revolut do a transfer to Coinbase and it took a few hours. But now it takes 1-2days after they execute for it to get to my Coinbase account.

If you ask someone on the street if their email client uses the internet, I am sure almost all people will say yes. The internet is an enabler for many things. Forget about protocols. The idea of a blockchain is an enabler for many things.
You are totally right from a technical standpoint. But most people will not care about this level of detail (which for us is still very high level).
Everyone should be able to grasp an analogy.

@_date: 2017-12-26 00:42:14
Why is it cheaper than just sending the coins to the segwit address?
Is this just piggy backing on the assumption that you are sending someone BTC, in which case you may as well send the change to a segwit address?
Is there any way to preserve metadata, like when the amount was sent to the originating wallet receive address? I need this data to work out profit from when it was bought. Once I send my BTC to a segwit wallet this'll all be lost :(
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:28:12

I've had just onboarded around 5 friends right before the update :/ it'll be interesting to know. I think I read its a flat 1.5% fee but not sure on where they get their rate from. Also not sure if they charge to send BTC to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:20:07
You have the private key which lets you spend that coin. You can store that private key how you like. Mobile wallet apps use a 12 word phrase to store/regen the private key, so keeping this phrase safe allows you to control your keys.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:34:53
Yep it costs.
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:06:35
Yep this is what I caught..
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:18:31
Coinbase doesn't let you change the fee upon withdrawing BTC to your wallet. It'll get confirmed within a few hours.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:50:05
I only generated a wallet a few weeks back, does that mean it's already making use of segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:34:07
Have you tried it, what's the fees like to buy BTC, vs sending EUR to GDAX?
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:32:20
Where are the iOS updates
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:39:25
You don't need fire. Just send from Revolut to Coinbase/GDAX. It takes a few hours for me on a weekday.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:11:25
It's doing the same for me, even made a post a wile back about it. Are you on iOS?
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:03:36
Only that address. If you use a HD wallet, it'll generate a new TX address after each use. If you have a static donation address, people will be able to see what goes in and out of that address but not your other addresses that the HD wallet derives from the xpub public key. If someone has your xpub then they can see all your transaction addresses and therefore trace all transactions you make in that wallet,
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:56:43
Please don't bite me for my current thoughts: I'm waiting for a dip/correction at this point. I think a lot of people might be in FOMO mode right now plus buying to double their coins post fork. Admittedly I have checked what happened at the segwit fork, should do that. I think it might be far fetched for a near future dip to go below $5.5k let alone $6k at this point though. I know there is no evidence for any of the above thoughts, its just my feelings after watching for a long time. Tone Vays did a good video yesterday on his thoughts too.
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:15:09
I just built an iOS app to take your public key and list your transactions with growth, like blockfolio but auto populated. Check my post history which shows the main balance/profit page also. Interested? I haven't listed it in the store yet, it's like 90% done. Just polishing it up now.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:38:20
Not sure what the issue is, to have a CC, you must have a bank card. Your bank charges to transfer money to another account?? Or you simply don't want to use your debit card?
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:29:29
Maybe some way to store the key on the blockchain encrypted with a biometric. Could use a blockchain to do it based on Ethereum. Then a DApp that gets the keys for you when presenting the correct biometric. The biometric essentially becomes the private key to access data in a specific block.

Electrum for a desktop wallet
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:12:02
Yeah I'm in the UK. 
I setup Coinbase and Revolut on my iPhone.
Through Revolut I top up using my debit card. Then in Revolut convert to Euros. Look in Coinbase's Euro wallet, press deposit. Note the bank details of Coinbase and add a beneficiary in Revolut. Transfer the euros to Coinbase, don't forget the reference. Takes 1hour during working hours. 
Login to GDAX, click deposit and select from Coinbase. Instantly the euros move to GDAX. Now set a limit order, e.g. 0.1BTC for 6000£. When the price hits 6k, your BTC are purchased. The fee is 0.05% iirc, this is the only fee in this whole process. You can now transfer the BTC to a wallet for free. 
The equivalent would cost about £30 in fees at Coinbase on £325 purchase.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:00:49
Keep us updated as mine is the same on iOS.
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:43:47
I didn't pay any fees at all ever using this method. I've done this twice. First time I sent 11EUR to Coinbase via Revolut. And I ended up with 11 EUR in Coinbase.
I did however use Coinbase the traditional way 3 times (just by doing a credit card purchase of some BTC) before moving to the method I posted. And that was costing me £20 to buy £300 worth of BTC.
As for limits, I sent 500 EUR to Coinbase then sent it to GDAX. Not sure if there is a limit this way, I think you can send a LOT. And this is the case where I can only buy 325£ at Coinbase buy my credit card.
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:58:40
It charges 20£ on 325£ to buy and then 5-10£ to move to your wallet, that's a huge percentage loss.  GDAX charges pennies in comparison using a limit order. And they pay the fee when you transfer BTC to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:51:08
It worked, just click options select bip39 and it imported it all ;) Electrum 2.9.3

Mine is doing the same, I'm on iOS. It says 1300£ but press full amount and it's only 800£, because it seems to only pull in 1 or 2 TX addresses. For now I'm just leaving it. I built my own watch wallet app so I will send it to an electrum desktop wallet when fees drop.

I am trying to release my app, it takes an xpub and shows growth on transactions as well as your balance/profit/exchange rate. It just takes ages to get an apple dev account ☹️

@_date: 2017-11-03 22:05:54
GBP to EUR via Revolut app, send to Coinbase or GDAX. If you send to Coinbase, login at GDAX with the same email and transfer the Coinbase cash to GDAX. Place a limit order at GDAX and buy BTC with 0 fees.

Revolut app on iOS, converts to EUR from GBP at spot price. Then bank transfer it via Revolut to GDAX/Coinbase for free. Just did 500£ this way.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:58:18
Transfer EUR via SEPA transfer to GDAX directly. I use the Revolut app on iOS to top up from a bank card. Then send it via Revolut to GDAX. That costs 0.

Use GDAX to avoid high fees.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:23:36
Cool, I just wanted to set my own fees (if ever needed), also mycelium didn't want to pull my funds from all addresses, it was just letting me use 2, so I couldn't send all my funds. iOS development looks dead so time to move away.
What do you mean by letting it sync? It's all there already by the looks of it.

I don't think it'll die, look at Bcash. Whales will buy before the fork and sell B2X asap. And thatll inflate BTC before fork, probably what's already happening. BTC will still be the only serious coin out of the BTC forks. I don't think anyone is seriously going to use the forks for anything but investment purposes (be it good or bad). BTC will still be the coin people actually use, like to buy good etc.

I saw people mention this in the past but not done it myself. Open a bank account at fidor bank and you can do a normal bank transfer from your debit account to it. Then from fidor bank do a SEPA transfer to GDAX in EUR for a £2,50 fee. Then trade the EUR for BTC for free if the order is not fulfilled instantly. I think it's also free to move BTC to your wallet from GDAX.

Try my iOS app "BTC Watch". It's free and you can watch an extended public key.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:03:47
But it costs to add a wallet public address. Does it support extended public keys? Or just single TX addresses? What about segwit and segwit ypub addresses?
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:53:41
BTC Watch is free on the AppStore and lets you watch your xpub/ypub. £2 is pushing it id say, also it's not clear what types of address you can watch. Most people use HD Wallets that have an address per TX, and an extended public key that generates all of them.

I do have the seed yes. Basically I went to send money to a new wallet address, when I hit "use all funds" it just picks up the first tx that arrived into the wallet, which was around £4. I can type 800£ and it seems to be ok though. Maybe the "use all funds" button is just not working as I expect?
Since breadwallet isn't offering anything more than mycelium, I'm not sure I shall bother, unless there is some other reason I should move to bread.

GDAX to mycelium direct, just don't click Max when sending it else it tries charging 3%.
I just used Coinbase to transfer the EUR because when I sent it to GDAX direct it didn't work. But I had done a different method at the time (fire bank to GDAX). I suspect Revolut to GDAX direct will be fine too.
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:49:28
I used Coinbase first but it took so much fees, like 20£ on 320£ purchase.
Now I use Revolut iOS app to convert GBP to EUR instantly. Send the EUR from Revolut to Coinbase, takes about 2 hours and it's free. Register at GDAX with the same email as Coinbase and tell it to transfer the money from Coinbase, instantly and free.
Then place a limit order (minimum 50$) for a price a little below market price. Wait a short while for it to fill. There is no fee!
Then transfer the BTC to my mycelium wallet address again for free.

For small amounts it's convenient to use Coinbase. And learn to then move the BTC to a wallet you own. Half way there once you've done that. Next step is to use a trading site like GDAX.
