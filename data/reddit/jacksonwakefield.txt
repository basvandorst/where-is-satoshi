According to a study of 775 fiat currencies by DollarDaze.org, there is no historical precedence for a fiat currency that has succeeded in holding its value. Twenty percent failed through hyperinflation, 21% were destroyed by war, 12% destroyed by independence, 24% were monetarily reformed, and 23% are still in circulation approaching one of the other outcomes.
The average life expectancy for a fiat currency is 27 years, with the shortest life span being one month. Founded in 1694, the British pound Sterling is the oldest fiat currency in existence. At a ripe old age of 317 years it must be considered a highly successful fiat currency. However, success is relative. The British pound was defined as 12 ounces of silver, so it's worth less than 1/200 or 0.5% of its original value. In other words, the most successful long standing currency in existence has lost 99.5% of its value.
Given the undeniable track record of currencies, it is clear that on a long enough timeline the survival rate of all fiat currencies drops to zero.

Historically, yeah. But there hasn’t been another option until only recently. Kenya’s M-Pesa currency isn’t fiat, it’s airtime minutes transferred from cellphone to cellphone. 
The digital connection we all have now opens up new doors and is why Bitcoin is slowly gaining traction as a possible contender for a better option.

Bloomberg did with the headline of fake protest and rented lambos. This was a funny idea but executed poorly. It comes off as looking desperate.

It's going to happen right before our eyes. It's more than  cryptocurrencies... it's the underlying blockchain technology that is changing the way the world does and will conduct business from a trust and governance standpoint.

We should request an AMA from this guy. It’d be interesting to know if his thoughts have evolved.

These guys talk in generalities. They don’t seem to know much more than people on CNBC. We need some YouTube content where experts aren’t self proclaimed who and who educate the masses on the utility cryptocurrencies have vs. base all of their analysis on short term price movements.
Edit: spelling

I suppose it's up for interpretation, but given the context I'd assume they're referring the macro here... meaning full industries versus individual businesses within an industry. It has paradigm shifting potential.

How do we get to the pure p2p vision? Is there any real harm to use “banks” to stoke the flames early on while p2p is inaccessible to most? 
Seems logical to leverage the the bank’s money and reach to spread adoption and awareness of bitcoin. Theoretically that would increase the value of bitcoin so increase the price of btc generating capital for new disruptive projects to sprout up in a larger p2p market. I assume that’s what we are doing but I see your point about tracking. 
What’s another way?

No one knows where the floor is so averaging down is considered a strategic move if you believe the price will rise in the long run.

Look at gold prices since the US dropped the gold standard in the early 70s. On a yearly basis it has been volatile as well. Lost 27% of its value in 2013. It was less volatile pre-70s dating back to the early 1800s. As bitcoin is more widely adopted and if it becomes the new gold standard or fills a similar role, it’s volatility will lessen.

Per wiki...
On March 14, 2019, the Tokyo District Court found Karpelès guilty of falsifying data to inflate Mt. Gox’s holdings by $33.5 million, for which he was sentenced to 30 months in prison, suspended for four years, meaning he will serve no time unless he commits additional offenses over the next four years.
Mt. Gox's bankruptcy proceedings will repay creditors in Japanese yen at a price around 483 US dollars per bitcoin (total of 45.6 billion Japanese yen or 400 million US dollars) and it has been reported that this will leave Karpelès, after creditors are repaid, with the bulk of the wealth left over from the difference. Based on the market price at the beginning of 2018 (around $15,000 per bitcoin), the difference is significant, and would leave Karpelès with bitcoins valued at more than 1.4 billion US dollars.

Wouldn’t be surprised if this was partly true.. but less for the rise in price and more to manipulate the media into spreading awareness.

Soon we’ll shorten it to $ to be ironic and it’ll inadvertently catch on, confusing everyone using $ for USD so they’ll have to convert all of their assets to $atoshis for the sake of ease

Similar story OP.... Learned of bitcoin in 2012 but didn't "get it" until 2017 just after I hit "rock bottom." Learning about bitcoin was also the only thing that brought me happiness... or fulfillment. For months I read about it and familiarized myself with many of the underlying disciplines like information theory, game theory, network science, etc. During that time it climbed to 20k which was enough to get me out of the financial hole I was in at the time. Have been obsessed ever since. It's incredible. It will be more disruptive than we can even comprehend...

Adoption of bitcoin though inherently adds value to the network. It’s like phones... they’re more valuable the higher the adoption because you can connect with more people. Bitcoin is both a network and the currency on the network. I’m deriving the price of the crypto currency based on the value of the tech and the strength of its network
@_date: 2019-09-18 07:04:55
Like I said... if 7.5 billion people adopt it. That's a way that could happen
@_date: 2019-09-29 16:34:23
How prevalent is actual bitcoin adoption there?

MySpace failed because of poorly thought out governance which lead to poor customer experience. Their profiles were not immutable as you could edit the HTML of your own page, which lead to porn pop ups and malware taking over.

Kinda funny.... It’s forcing you to adopt bitcoin more by reducing the options options you have to send money.

I’ve been to three books stores between California and Texas (two Barnes &amp; Nobles in and one independent) looking for books on cryptocurrencies, bitcoin, and blockchain in general. Not a single book on any of those topics were carried in-store. Interesting the US is either very behind or the technology is incredibly nascent. Probably both.
