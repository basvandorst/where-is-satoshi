Apologies for the downtime. I am also a huge fan of Humble Bundle and hate to see the bitcoin option go down for even a second. There was a bug over the weekend that affected certain merchant orders, but a fix has now gone out and hopefully the bitcoin option will be back shortly.
Thanks for your patience everyone!

Collecting device fingerprints is for account security. If someone attempts to access your account from an IP address in a country that you've never connected from, it raises flags. However, spoofing an IP address is trivially easy (i.e. Tor). Device fingerprinting gives Coinbase an alternative way to make sure that your account isn't compromised. You can read the information collected by Coinbase in the privacy policy:

We are happy to see this community effort based on our open API! We have reached out to the developer to review the code and are happy with the quality and security of the code.
@_date: 2014-10-23 17:06:16
These are great points:
(1) We usually let the user know much more quickly, but sometimes activity between clicking buy and actually receiving the bitcoin flag the purchase, which can cause notification to be delayed.
(2) This is by design. We don't want professional scammers to learn, and thus be able to game, our system.
(3) This is to avoid encouraging social engineering attempts by professional scammers. But you make a great point - I will think about how we could make it easier to contact us.
Thank you for the feedback - these are some well-thought critiques.

@_date: 2014-10-23 16:19:45
Hi I'm sorry for this incorrect cancellation, this is obviously not the experience that Coinbase is trying to create. I do want to explain why this sort of mistake can occur.
Coinbase has a complex machine learning algorithm which determines the probability that a particular user is purchasing bitcoin using a stolen identity or is otherwise a chargeback risk – this helps keep the bitcoin community safe from fraudulent activity, protects non-bitcoin users from identity theft, and protects Coinbase from monetary loss due to fraud. This risk algorithm only applies to purchasing bitcoin with dollars and does not apply to sells or any bitcoin-to-bitcoin transactions.
This sort of risk-management is vital to any company that sells an irreversible payment mechanism (bitcoin) for a reversible payment mechanism (ACH bank transfer). When users with stolen bank accounts successfully purchase bitcoin or an bank transfer is reversed for some other reason, Coinbase eats the entirety of the loss.
So how do mistakes like yours happen when you're obviously not using stolen bank credentials? It's complicated. We take into account numerous different parameters when determining the risk of an individual order, and update the risk of each order in real time. It is extremely difficult to precisely determine which purchases will result in a chargeback, and which purchases will not - an entire industry exists attempting to solve this problem. 
I can take a look at your account to determine exactly why this particular purchase was flagged if you email support[at]coinbase.com. We regularly review purchases and reverse bad decisions made by our algorithm. Again, I'm extremely sorry for the friction here. We are constantly working hard to improve and I appreciate your feedback.
@_date: 2014-06-05 20:39:35
Scoring is subjective, but most of the questions have specific answers we're looking for.
@_date: 2014-10-03 01:50:31
You make a great point! I didn't communicate that properly - by "spoof" an IP I didn't mean mimic a user's home IP address, I meant mimic the country that they are located in, which by using Tor is usually easy, as long as there is an exit node in their country.
@_date: 2014-06-05 22:37:48

Olaf from Coinbase here.
I'm extremely sorry for this loss. I want to explain what happened.
This attacker requested a password reset, and completed the reset 50 seconds later, meaning they were able to gain access to your email account.
A minute later they were able to bypass your two-factor authentication - as messages sent to Google Voice accounts are available for viewing from a web browser, the attacker was able to obtain and input the verification code to our system because they had access to your Google account.
Because the attacker gained access to your Google account, they were able to both reset your password and bypass the two-factor authentication which was set up using Google Voice.
Unfortunately I have no way of knowing how the attacker gained access to your Google account - I wish I could be more helpful there. I hope this explains what happened, and again, I'm very sorry for all the trouble. Don't hesitate to email support if you have any additional questions about this!

This is a great resource - thank you for sharing.
@_date: 2015-02-04 03:50:20
In order to prevent users from falling victim to malicious OAuth applications, after the incident you're referring to we began blocking applications with a name including the word "Coinbase" (or variations) so attackers could not mimic our authentic applications (like our exchange, for example). 
In today's case, the attacker was able to bypass this preventive measure by using special characters to imitate our name once again. We're now working on more thoroughly patching this so the application name will not be able to include "Coinbase" or variations.
Additionally, we've decided to add special verifications for all applications which require debit access to your account. This will add a layer of manual assessment to prevent malicious apps from using our API.
Thank you for your concern - I take account security very seriously and I'm glad you want to know exactly how we'll prevent this type of attack in the future.

This is a great feature suggestion. However, the fraud we deal with does not stem from compromised user accounts, but rather stolen bank accounts. Adding two-factor authentication for buys and transactions would do little to prevent fraud stemming from stolen identities.

We used to auto-refund small payments to merchants when the amount sent was incorrect. For most users this was helpful because they didn't have to email us or the merchant to get back the incorrectly sent bitcoin, but there were edge cases where it caused problems (like sending from a shared wallet). We no longer do these auto-refunds, so problems with it have been eliminated!

I have to seriously apologize for the delay on resolving this.

We're working on it now - thanks for your patience with this.
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:53:13
We're working on fixing this problem now - although it still sometimes occurs, some fixes we pushed have reduced it significantly over the course of the past few months. This blog post is actually still relevant to explaining the issue - it seems to be primarily caused by using unconfirmed inputs to generate new transactions. This can happen with change addresses or newly minted gen coins (which cannot be spent for 100 blocks).

Here's what happened: for merchant payments from non-Coinbase users, if an incorrect bitcoin value is sent to the payment address, that bitcoin is auto-refunded to the address it was sent from. We realized that this auto-refund could potentially be sent back to an address the payee doesn't control (this is what happened to zelphics), so we only auto-refund if the payment amount is small in order to prevent serious loss in this type of situation.
These merchant addresses aren't linked to user accounts, so I'm not sure how this happened. The auto-refund only applies to low-value merchant payments, and should never affect funding your personal wallet.
I'm sorry for the delay in responding to your support ticket! We've been actively hiring additional support staff for the last month so we can reply more quickly. PM the email you use with Coinbase and I'll take a look at your account to see how this happened.

Our risk algorithm is unfortunately the one aspect of our system in which we cannot be fully transparent, because it would enable scammers to game the system.
The risk we are assessing is the risk of a bank transfer failing, for example when a fraudster uses a stolen identity. I hope this explains a bit why we have these algorithms!
