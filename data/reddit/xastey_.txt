It wasn't if you wanted to or not I was just asking to understand how people that wanted to cash out such a large some could do so. But thanks for providing some info. Nice job on your investments
@_date: 2016-04-13 13:26:55
And I'm over here still sitting on the heytip.me domain.. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:55:14
Less then PayPal and other means imo
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:19:25
Just reset it... Why take the chance...trust NO ONE is my motto.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:21:48
@_date: 2019-07-22 13:21:17
Remember when my new group service switched to using bitcoin.. I was like "Fuck that, what is this crap"
O boy I didn't know any better.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:20:15
About 4 coins would pay off all of mines :(
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:31:11
FOMO is a real think folks lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:38:54
It was almost at 19k at one point....
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:35:59
So how is this done.. do they like instantly cash out at $5m or what.. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:57:49
Now let's see you try the cash out.... But seriously is it even possible to cash out that much if you wanted to? And if so how long would it take and what flags would it set off...
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:53:49
WOAH.. just woke up and its almost 17k.. hold me.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:47:17
Can we donate to "Help  Redditor's pay off student loan" charity 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:32:41
Very and I haven't bought any in years... Just been hodling
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:51:48
Kinda wish it did a hard crash you know.. just to scare the shit out of newbies and to buy more
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:35:34
And it was a horrible show..they didn't explain shit at all... Just fucking worthless
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:11:22
Why couldn't you just buy it yourself.. my make your boss do it? Pretty stupid. Have control over your Money... Make a choice when you invest.. just seems stupid 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:48:01
Damn not one helpful post.. I would like to know how to avoid this other then hodl or get a nano and hodl
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:55:30
I mean any sane person that does work in crypto for an exchange would of bought coins before a announcement.
The problem I see is that Coinbase didn't give the public notice... But do companies normally do this? I know some services I use don't announced new features ahead of time due to not meeting deadlines.
So I guess my question is, giving the fact that Coinbase is regulated and whatnot. Is there some law or guidelines that have to be done when dealing with exchange in the US?
If not I can see this happening again
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:27:04
It's not good enough it was a crash, everyone should get out NOW.
Cheap coin cheap coins
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:11:00
Ok sorry for me being stupid... But what does adding BCH support on Coinbase have to do with anything.. why are people saying there was inside trading with the price hike... Just don't understand
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:02:44
LOL and then it dropped to 14.6k.. Thanks
@_date: 2015-12-22 14:39:28
Playing on ppl fears.. In informed ppl that don't know how disruptive this would be will get her support.. Just a shame.. Seems all candidates are bat shit crazy.. This is going to be real interesting

@_date: 2014-01-10 15:40:58
Wonder how this company makes any money.. I ran/developed a few cam sites and bandwidth gets crazy
@_date: 2014-06-12 02:01:57

@_date: 2014-10-04 01:03:36
Wow didn't know the price was this low.. Time to rack up and test circle out
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:28:10
Did they even give you a warning? I have chase myself but havn't bought any bitcoins in some time.
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:45:16
So great fuck chase
@_date: 2018-05-20 13:44:52
Always do a test transaction .. 15k randomly will set off flags
@_date: 2014-08-30 04:46:57
Waiting for this so I can get the Destiny  bundle and either 2TB drive or a game.. may just get the drive since Diablo is sold out :(
@_date: 2014-08-31 23:56:53
I just made a purchase about 5cst today. On another note I see why the ps4 whites were sold out. Got email that said it was confirmed.. Only paid 424
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:59:43
Well that was quick was at 800 last night.
@_date: 2014-08-31 00:53:21
Some guy somehow got the discount in a giftcard.. No clue how.
@_date: 2014-08-30 07:04:20


ERROR The promo code BITCOINDEAL requires a minimum purchase amount before it can be redeemed.
WTF balance is 549.98
Well FUCK you can't use it on the ps4 white pre-order.. WTF
@_date: 2014-08-12 13:23:55
Thanks for the idea I already do software Dev so something like this is right up my alley
@_date: 2014-04-09 17:58:19
So wait, not Chase can't close my account??
@_date: 2014-09-01 00:02:41
Well damn... This is why we can't have nice things.
@_date: 2014-06-07 00:16:43
Never used this site, but did he just looks 25btc?
@_date: 2014-08-31 00:34:39
pre-order or gift item most of the time.
@_date: 2014-04-25 14:53:44
Just a sad title, people would do anything to for  page views.
@_date: 2014-08-30 12:34:52
I was about to say how you get it with that free gift
@_date: 2014-09-01 01:47:23
BITCOINDEAL.. make sure that you have all items from Newegg.. either 300 or 500 worth of items and no items with a gift or pre-order.
@_date: 2014-08-30 22:36:07
So you have a working link.. the one on site doesn't work.
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:43:57
So what in the hell happened
@_date: 2014-06-19 22:42:58
I'll take 2  btc and u can have it
@_date: 2014-08-30 07:35:25
Talking to a rep right now about this.. wouldn't take my  white ps4 buy.
No pre-orders... SHITTTTTTTTTTTTT.. they should really put that in the terms.
@_date: 2014-02-21 12:45:47
This is soo tempting to gamble, I don't know man.
@_date: 2014-09-01 07:16:41
I ended up pulling the trigger around 5cst sunday after I heard some reports that newegg stopped deal.. wasn't on the frontpage anymore but promo worked.. glad I did cause the price is just tanking now, may buy in to recover since it will all be gains.
@_date: 2014-08-20 00:28:20
If only I could chase may just close my account
@_date: 2014-08-30 08:19:25
I feel u man.. Its 3am here .. Waited all week and night just to find out no pre-orders. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 13:19:56
They don't need to know about it but the outcome of a 51% attack will still be felt by these normal consumers. That was my point if it wasn't clear
@_date: 2014-02-08 13:36:16
Yeah I need to get my coins out of there quick and backed up
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:48:01
Were's the popcorn, this is about to get good.
@_date: 2014-08-30 14:40:17
You guys are making me want to get this monitor.. dev as well and already have 2 monitors but need more room. But sadly would have upgrade my vid card and maybe mobo
@_date: 2014-09-04 16:42:52
What sucks for me is, I suck with ideas.. wtf else does the BTC community need. I got all this knowledge of system development and can't apply it to anything makes me sick.
@_date: 2014-08-30 12:10:02
Man thats a good deal and I already bought 16GB this week for my pc (now 20GB) o well I'll find something to buy. Been trying to use my BTC for a while and every damn time something comes up.
@_date: 2014-06-03 13:06:17
I can't wait till a client wants to play with btc, just hope it happens when its at a down slope
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:22:51
Be afraid be very afraid
@_date: 2014-08-30 12:37:19
true, it just sucks they dont have this anywere on the deal or on their site. Should give it to you just because of that but I guess we all can't be picky.
@_date: 2014-06-02 15:13:48
You dont went full retard, sending bitcoins to gox, sorry for your lost.
@_date: 2014-08-30 07:11:04
Well I dont have a combo deal just trying to get a pre-order and a segate 2TB drive.. in the queue for live chat.. lets see if they can help been waiting all week.
@_date: 2014-08-30 20:41:03
Wondering if I even need the white bundle. Can't use promo on it but its sooo sexy.
Well just found  tough choices
@_date: 2014-08-19 01:18:42
I get mines for free.. We have to use them for daycare.
@_date: 2014-03-11 23:16:48
And now my heytip.me domain will never exists
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:17:49
just wanted to say the logo looks like a vagina.. just saying.
@_date: 2014-08-30 07:44:09
They say no pre-oders as well as :
International order 
Will Call order 
Newegg digital gift card 
Premier Membership Subscription 
Pre-order 
Return label (online and offline) 
@_date: 2014-08-30 08:13:36
Admit going try again tomorrow see if another rep can do something for me
@_date: 2014-05-02 00:46:22
So glad I don't do adult Dev anymore. It was fun but fucked me over for when I wanted to do more mainstream stuff. Can't really show clients your adult stuff you did over 6 of the 8 years deving
@_date: 2014-06-01 13:29:39
Why they dont block youtube ads anymore plus uses a shit load of memory on chrome.
@_date: 2014-08-30 12:35:29
Thank for posting that it was late last night and I was pissed.
@_date: 2014-08-28 01:28:41
May get that ps4 this time, please btc drop before the 30.. just long enough for me to buy less then go back up on the 30th :D
@_date: 2014-07-20 00:41:22
He pulled a Sheldon 
@_date: 2014-06-07 13:21:23
My lawd, he must be an early adopter to be ok with loosing that much.
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:33:07
Damn I should of used my heytip.me domain while I had the chance. Once again
@_date: 2014-11-17 23:49:58
*mind blown*
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:51:48
Funny how Texas will use Bitcoin before they legalize medical use of marijuana. 
@_date: 2014-08-31 21:45:25
Hope it recovers soon need to make my Newegg purchase, was about to pull the gun and then decided to check the price and BAM.
@_date: 2014-11-09 15:15:10
Heytip.me ;)
@_date: 2014-08-31 14:15:38
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING... I was waiting all day and I get an extra $20 off.. about to buy and the price TANKED.. COME ON... guess I'll hold it till the last min
@_date: 2014-07-27 17:50:50
DigiCert had a problem yesterday guess they  havn't fixed it it. Messed up github,bitbucket and a few other big name sites.
Edit: Umm thanks for gold that wasn't expected.
@_date: 2014-08-31 17:25:07
I guess that's why the price is so low now
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:41:15
Think last I checked was around 5k (only had 5 models and can't find logs to get the exact count).. think more on one side, but the client streaming his cams via popunders and adverts .. he ended up going under cause he couldn't attract people to his site and spend money on the models. This is the main reason why I never made an adult site even though been deving for them for about 6 years.. its a money pit , esp with cam sites if you don't at-least cover your server/bandwidth charges.
 Good luck man and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2014-06-19 12:36:27
I should really try to sell my domain heytip.me to someone lol
@_date: 2014-06-08 12:39:30
I'm a bitcoin user and technical, but how do we expect the normal consumer to ever have faith in bitcoin if we are already close to 50% . To me it just seems that this will happen on day in the near future.
@_date: 2015-01-09 03:06:09
With something as complex as crypto how can you know that your custom solution is indeed correct and not that the widely used solution is wrong. I work in programming so I understand this for the most part, but how does on handle this for crypto, since its all math and so many solutions to validate use the "wrong" library, seems like there is no way to fully know.  
This isn't a down play on your hard work I really would like to know how you even approach something like this.
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:55:45
Damn should of bought
@_date: 2014-08-31 00:13:01
Yeah its back now the %2 for mr rebate says 1%.. o well still some rebate. thanks
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:42:29
GOT DAMN. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:08:46
Eh guess I need to get off my ass and finally move off of Coinbase, so how on earth do I get my coins out :'(
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:06:53
What happened, I haven't checked in months and last time it was almost 500. Not worried just wondering why such a drop.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:44:19
So I haven't accessed my coinbase account in years.. how do I get my shit off.. like where do I transfer it to, just a local wallet? Help??
@_date: 2019-11-29 18:55:47
@_date: 2019-11-29 16:52:52
Thanks , any reviews from others... I was going to get the Nano S but you says it's bad... Care to go into more details?
@_date: 2019-11-05 12:48:55
Remind me in 8 months
@_date: 2019-11-29 20:18:42
Thanks, it's hard to tell from the website but does it support multiple coins at a time or need one for each coin. I just need 2 since I lost my seed for my ripple wallet sometime back... Still salty about that one ��
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:18:29
I'm not really working right now so can't do that.. but best believe once I get my money straight I will be buying biweekly
@_date: 2019-11-29 20:32:25
Thanks a bunch.
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:03:00
Man I tried to transfer last Sunday night... Woke up Monday and it still didn't confirm. Try again...12hra later nothing. End the end I ended up paying like 6$  to get it to go thru.
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:31:47
What in the hell..... Just HODL.
Just fucking HODL x
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:14:10
Nah crappy ass old card and can't buy one now.. o well I'll get more when I can.. already have some but want more
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:35:28
spent $6 getting my shit transferred out so I could cash in that other coin shit. Tried lower but didn't confirm after 12hrs so I just changed it. 
@_date: 2019-11-29 18:31:01
Thanks... I just need to get my coins off coinbase as well as electrum... Haven't touched them in years lol
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:21:34
fuckin FOMO
@_date: 2017-08-11 18:36:59
sucks not having income to spend on btc o well.
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:53:12
So I have my wallet.. how in the hell do I split BCH anyways, so I can sell it?
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:39:38
OK so I have some BTC.. bought when it was around 200 a few years back.
How on earth would you cash in quickly enough if you say had 100btc.. I mean you could buy a crap ton of stuff online while the price is high and all but what if you wanted a case payout.. then what about taxes and reporting???
@_date: 2016-12-26 16:50:05
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:25:59
It seems not long ago we were at 2k.. There is no moon just hodl
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:26:44
Stupid me.. thanks
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:51:01
Well damn
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:55:04
FOMO , that's how
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:42:20
Yeah I saw this ep.. They are just playing out what happened in the UK a while back.. or was it Europe..
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:19:31
What in the fuck is going on... I'm scared... Really
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:34:34
LOL I love seeing theses.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:28:59
GDAX.. but they have sell limits unless you do more verification and what not.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:49:12
You motherfucker... Every damn time
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:43:52
No way in hell the let you fill this order.. but if the do.. get that lambo for us
@_date: 2018-03-03 14:01:30
Of course they did.. so we all get .0000000002BTC when its done right ? lol
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:32:04
I wish I sold  at 20k just to buy back low. My only regret but I didn't sell so everything is still gains so no harm I guess
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:26:46
I saw it go down at 13k.. I stopped watching ... I do it every time. I learned my lesson on buying high and selling low back when it was around $750 a coin
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:18:47
Damn wish I would of sold to buy MORE
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:07:40
Remember when you purchase Bitcoin and the price goes up, you didn't gain anything until you cashed out.
Just saying. believer of Bitcoin but what is this fud shit like BTC doesn't have the same flaw
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:09:37
So use common sense... Got it, how much did you loose?
@_date: 2017-05-29 02:31:24
And you know this is great as I feel it will drive up prices and more adoption
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:42:56
Are you fucking kidding me. Congrats
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:39:25
I bought a PS4 who knows how many years ago... Rip
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:54:10
Soo soo soo many tears.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:15:18
You should really write this, I know a lot of people would enjoy it and learn from it. The more the community can share about problems they have experienced when bring this platform to the masses just better helps the cause in the end so we don't keep making the same errors over and over.
@_date: 2017-05-21 06:16:25
And I did't want to buy coins when my NewsGroup wanted to use it for services.. o why did I buy in oo sooo late :'(
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:59:42
Did you confirm it twice? Happened to me.. the first time I never went in and realized I needed to confirm it from two different email accounts.
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:01:06
It doesn't..
You would have to transfer the coins to a second wallet after the fork then choose what software to use for BCC and import your keys there.
@_date: 2017-07-05 11:46:22
Was just about to ask about these hardwallets... What about Ledger nano anyone knows?
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:58:20
Go ahead a fucking sell... Sell so I get cheap coins.. damn scary pants lol
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:06:42
RemindMe! 1 month "gingerbreadfutters buys 191 btc for 325k"
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:34:12
Showed up instantly in my wallet.. not sure how long it took to confirm since I didn't really care.. at the time fee was $1.65
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:42:38
I know a place where this will make people go to stox...lets see if I'm eating shoes after this date or not.
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:18:04
Look, I'll give them this,.. they sent out an email, but they knew long before today or yesterday that they were not going to support it. I first knew about it last week I want to say. The fact that their are withdraw limits ( I really hope they remove this for this period) they sent it out a bit too late.
Hopefully all the people that have funds located at coinbase can get their funds out.
@_date: 2017-07-15 12:37:58
What's a good wallet? I didn't want to download the whole chain just to transfer... Thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:08:57
Damn must be balling to not be able to transfer out over the past 6 weeks.. didn't even realize they have limits from BTC to BTC withdraws that just seems stupid as fuck.
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:00:24
Yeah confused as fuck... So if I have an electrum wallet I'm safe for now and just have to wait to move anything until a confirmed working path has been made.....right?
@_date: 2017-05-05 11:57:34
Why in the hell is this bubble happening .. just crazy
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:01:05
Thanks, I was going to get a Ledger Nano but wasn't going to be here till after Sept. So looking for something where I didn't have to download the whole chain (Win) now but yeah high fees :(. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:04:54
Yeap just finished moving mines today.. damn fees I swear.. but it's out and safe for now
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:31:20
so glad I moved out my coins last week. Hope everyone can get their coins out.. this is starting to get messy
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:25:42
You make it seem that its better to trust a phone (if you dont loose it) then a computer due to the fact. Which honestly is scary to say, but may be true based off your position.
It would be better to compare phone/computer to hardware/paper.
Hardware/paper is always better , a bit more complex in setup so pick on. keep your seed and password and you should be fine
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:34:14
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:20:53
Have to follow a few links but just so you know:
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:31:47
It really isn't.. I mean college was fun, it did allow me to work on my skills to start my own business, I used to sleep in all my classes and pass with A's and B's( A's in my major classes) helped teach some classes and did my Senior level courses like my sophomore and jr year lol.
The only thing good was not having to worry about life and learning more about myself. Other then that it wasn't worth the 80k in debit I gain.
I did meet my wife there but blaah ��
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:19:47
Funny coinbase just sent me an email about this. But I want to know how in the hell did the hacker  get access to his phone 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:45:12
Loss? I'm already up on top lol been like that for years.. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:18:02
This response here is why BTC tanks so much.
Everyone is willing to believe what's going around and don't have any facts to back it up. 
Sorry to say but it's investing, you win some you lose some.. all of it right now is speculation on what may or maybe happen. 
Rule of thumb.. invest what you can safely afford to lose.. nothing more and if you loose that about by whatever % you won't feel so bad about it. 
Live by that rule and HODL and you will be fine.

Thanks, dont want to waste that 200gb to download the blockchain so I'll look into electrum.. also fees for transferring.. I've been seeing a lot of post about crazy fees.. what's a best place to see what fees I should apply for transferring out from an exchange. I really don't care how long it takes as long it doesn't take like a week lol.
Thanks I've been out of the loop for so long

Depending on how their app is development you have multiple components to look at
1) websevers. Yes you can just throw more of those easily at aws... But then you have to make sure that adding say 50-100 more connections per second will affect the database.
2) app servers, this includes any real-time stuff like websocks and the actually dashboard logic.. same thing can deploy more and still have problems
3) databases, redis,postgres, nosql etc. you can get a bigger server but then you have to make sure replication is working for reads and writes.
4) assets , this is were your cdn comes in to play. This is one of the easiest ones you've can optimize but mostly never run into a problem to do so for standard webapps.
5) more devs... People need to know how the system work, that takes time and training and if rushed you can have more bugs even with peer reviews.
So yeah you can throw severs but there are still problems that can arise and you can even even more problems if you haven't thought about it.
With all of that said, they should of had a plan for this and started scaling way before. They are working with money, they have to be a bit more proactive with protecting their customer and their own personal investments.
The failed their customers

You wouldn't happen to know which ones would be the most profitable now?
@_date: 2013-04-28 16:06:09
Hey just checked out your site but didn't see the ui?
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:20:43
You know sometimes I think that.. then other times I think they are protecting their own investments and buying them for the low... who knows at this point
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:08:45
I was about to sell.. was way up  from my investment.. got to confirm and well site down lol
@_date: 2013-10-22 01:57:54
Maybe I will make back the money I lost when buying at the last ~$250 bubble
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:25:02
Thanks man
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:51:23
Me, but it was the next day I think. I've been keeping them till now.. have 4.5
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:06:54
Yes.. if you have coins in an exchange what should you do , create a wallet on your system and transfer there? If so what wallet to ensure that if a fork happens your coins will still be usable? Hardware wallets are out of the question since they are all sold out or backordered.
@_date: 2013-04-28 16:04:58
Trust me I know.. In have built many things that didn't get adopted... Rest assure i'm not going in this bigheaded.. I've done many startups.. Some funded others failed. Also that's a clever idea for paywalls... Was also thinking about app.net since the content there has more value then say on twitter
@_date: 2013-06-28 03:39:15
I'm glad I put off my client's project , he wanted to do micro payments.. This will come in handy
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:06:40
You are a better man then most of us.
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:33:58
Guess it was a smart move
@_date: 2013-07-25 22:27:45
I'm implementing a btc tip system for one of my chat clients coupled with revshare with affiliates.
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:27:18
Good Ideas here, I'm going have to come back and see which ones I can do in my free time.
@_date: 2013-05-18 12:49:47
So is this all theory or what?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:19:56
Same here.. been trying
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:08:50
I recovered stuff in the pass, first STOP using the drive, main drive and flash drive. Next you want to get Hiren Boot Disk (the best if you can get it) or Ultimate Book Disk and boot into that, then use the tools there. The reason you want to do this is it will load the tools into memory so you can prevent overwritting any files.
I have used this method a couple of times and recovered more then I would ever thought. Good luck man and let us know how it works.

All those people that called him an idiot.. we should send them this to remind them what an idiot looks like.
@_date: 2013-05-29 22:42:25
Yeap them.. Don't have to pay till end of year so I'll use my bitcoins then

My Irc shell provider uses these guys...got a email about this this morning
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:35:15
Backend Dev here... Let's talk
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:23:12
Umm how are they doing this? And also is the difficulty the same or does it just mirror the current blockchain?
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:23:00
I bought at 3@ 235 and held, took a while but finally made a profit.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:49:00
I used bit instant about 30mins a go.. Before I even got back home from CVS it was done... So maybe less then 5mins
@_date: 2013-04-28 13:26:51
Yeah I was surprised this domain wasn't taken.. Its just perfect
@_date: 2013-04-27 17:26:10
Well that wasn't the response I was expecting.. guess you guys get a lot of these posts here
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:03:55
Xmas is around the corner ... Should give everyone 0.005BTC in this sub :D
@_date: 2013-04-27 14:30:13
Can you do me a favor and let me know what time of pos system you have name and model number would be helpful
@_date: 2013-04-28 13:25:55
I'll add it to the list, one problem is trying to get the admins to install the plugin especially if they aren't text wise 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:51:52
This is what happens when I try to get on this.. 2 days later shit is at $73.. should of never placed a order at coinbase.. never again
@_date: 2013-05-26 20:55:21
You guys may want to check out the thread over at [hackernews]( there was one guy claiming he already found flaws in the implentation  that would cause a network wide blackout .. just be careful
@_date: 2013-04-28 13:22:43
Appreciate it
@_date: 2013-04-28 13:31:56
Yeah that's the plan.. I already started to look into it.. With that and wordpress the adoption should be large.. Still not sure what incentives to do to have site owners install this other then a small fraction of the tip as a fee, trying to make this as cheap as possible for users
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:48:51
I was referring to the ps4 lol
@_date: 2013-06-22 03:11:01
Man I bought on coinbase RIGHT before the drop.. took 5 days when it got to my account the price was 110 or something like that.. and I paid 220.. sad day, sucks that you can't cancel when it takes this long stupid feature.
@_date: 2013-04-27 18:02:33
I see.. Well giving that I have done multiple startups, build hardware for vending machine (social vending) with funding.. I can say that this is going to be built.. just a matter of time .. Reading up the bitcoind docs right now, have to create a wrapper for scala then off to the backend (play!) service, then wordpress plugin since thats the easiest , then open for input. But yeah I can see why you responded like that, makes sense.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:30:46
Feel the same way man.. Bought on coin base and its still in pending state.. I just hope the transaction doesn't go through
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:47:02
Cool as long as I get my 3btc at the rate in paid its all good
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:27:25
I can only laugh as I felt the same way with the April crash.
@_date: 2013-04-30 12:02:22
Thanks a lot for your support
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:25:22
You know what I COMPLETELY forgot I could do this.. how did you buy it may want to pick up one.
@_date: 2013-04-27 17:24:06
Yeah I checked them out.. still trying to figure how I can be different from them. I was thinking more of like the tipping bot here just done wide scale, other forums, by different identifiers(username,email,domain etc). The realword one is a bit tricky still working that one out.
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:08:05
Sorta wanna sell with hopes of it falling a bit so I can make a profit from my 250 buy earlier this year, but the other side of me wants to see this skyrocket
