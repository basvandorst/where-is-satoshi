And soon they may call it Ethereum. A bit ironic the ETH bubble coincides with Davos.

Any day now. /s
It'd be best to just switch to Ethereum now. There is no hard fork there's just a mass exodus going on and you don't want to be the last one to make the jump.
You may view this as a "pump" but I'm sure many of you will look back and regret turning your eye on Ethereum just because you're heavily invested in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 00:48:33
Must be a scam. /s
If you haven't already, you really should do some research about Ethereum. It's going to start to compete with Bitcoin very soon with the homestead release.

The name was created when I was new to Ethereum... when the network launched over the summer...

Nothing personal but this seems like a waste of effort. There already is a smart contracts system working (in production) with an emerging ecosystem that works well with the Bitcoin blockchain (see. btcrelay). It's called Ethereum. 
There time and effort would be better served trying to solve the scaling issues that Bitcoin has. Bitcoin has a chance to be the greatest store of value on earth. Focus on that use case. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:59:54
It's open source software and requires consensus, just like Bitcoin. can't control the network anymore than Satoshi can control Bitcoin.

I'll be paying close attention to this project. To me it seems it's adding complexity to a problem that already has an elegant solution. At this point I don't have enough information though so I'll wait for the whitepaper, demo, launch etc.
@_date: 2015-10-02 16:26:05
Except they're releasing a prototype today built on Ethereum.
"if you have the cryptocurrency Ether – buy a download of the song and have your transaction recorded permanently on the blockchain."
Of course many here don't want to touch another shitcoin. /s

With DEVcon in a week it's very likely there will be information regarding the move to PoS. The move to PoS will reduce inflation to zero or practically zero. The estimated number of ETH is approximately 90M but is highly dependent on how long they stay on PoW. 
To each their own though.
@_date: 2015-10-29 15:55:51
Unfortunately, there really hasn't been much of an update on what "the plan" is with PoS other than it is being worked on. What *is* known is there will be a move to PoS within the year (there's a difficulty bomb that will force it) and that there is a general consensus among the DEV team to reduce inflation to practically zero (if not totally to zero). Personally, this is a topic I've been waiting to get more clarification around and I think the conference is the perfect time to talk about it. Wouldn't surprise me if a blog post is released ahead of time so a discussion can occur at the conference.
@_date: 2015-10-28 18:47:58
Apparently Microsoft sees value in private blockchains. They're sponsoring the Ethereum conference and are in a partnership ConsenSys, a blockchain company building on top of Ethereum. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 16:12:48
You can do as you want.
Part of my short term thesis is that there are a number of people in the Bitcoin ecosystem who hate on Ethereum because they haven't done their research. Honestly, I can't necessarily blame them either because the project has changed a number of times and information quickly goes out of date.
@_date: 2015-10-01 17:01:41
The number of people in the Bitcoin community attacking Ethereum lately is disappointing. Then again, Bitcoiners are arguing with Bitcoiners these days so it's par for the course.
I find it ironic that these same people point out the fact that the Ethereum Foundation is running out of money (thanks to the devaluation of bitcoin) to fund development. When did Bitcoin get its funding again?
No matter what you think of Ethereum it's here. There will be a switch to some sort of new consensus mechanism of which Bitcoin can learn from. Isn't that what people like about "altcoins"? 
If the switch to PoS works as some of the Ethereum developers claim it will (of course they do), it's really going to make the competition between the 2 blockchains much more interesting. This is probably why you see so many attacks against the project from those who hold Bitcoin.  
I have my popcorn ready.
@_date: 2015-10-29 17:08:21
New is just my handle. :)
In any case, yes I know services *can* be copied to Bitcoin but that doesn't necessarily mean they *will* be. Things move pretty slow for Bitcoin (for good reason) and it's main value today is acting as a transfer of value. Yes a softfork will enable Bitcoin to do some of the things that Ethereum already does do but it doesn't mean the network can handle the additional traffic (the blocksize/scaling issue needs to be resolved). 
Bitcoin has the network effect with it comes to payments which is an awesome use case for a blockchain. Ethereum has the upper hand when it comes to smart contracts. I think it's delusional to think there will only be 1 blockchain, to be honest.
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:15:30
Fully aware. But you're making accusations about a project you have very little knowledge about. There is an incredible amount of misinformation about Ethereum and you're just adding to it. 
Satoshi let his code speak for itself and I'd like to think will do the same. If not him, someone else in the community will. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:25:49
Unless you're secretly part of ETHdev you have no clue how close the Ethereum project is to PoS or whether or not PoS will succeed or fail. 
Everything you write is to support a narrative that your business (KnCMiner) will remain relevant (/solvent) because of PoW.
@_date: 2015-10-14 22:09:29
Commercial beta in mid-summer 2016 (we'll see if that date sticks). They're at the same point Ethereum was last year. Will be hard to catch up. 
Recent news of the project just screams they're just trying to stay relevant after Ethereum shipped and is proven to work. 
@_date: 2015-10-16 15:20:12
There is Ethereum, a flavor of blockchain technology. It's nowhere ubiquitous as Bitcoin though.
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:38:01
Whatever that means.
Don't get me "wrong", I like Bitcoin. But you categorize Ethereum as a closed system which *is* wrong. Explain to me how Ethereum is exempt from human greed again? 
You think PoW is why Bitcoin is valuable because your company depends on it. End of story. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 11:29:45
Guy who works for a mining company says PoW is why Bitcoin is valuable. 
@_date: 2015-10-02 18:32:38
Only using Ether for the time being. Next update will allow for payment using credit cards. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:57:05
That's fair. But sidechains (although a very exciting project) are just theory at this point (unless 2-way pegs have been solved already). You also have to admit it's not terribly difficult to move value between chains either. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 15:28:32
Microsoft partnership and a feature in the Economist means there will be a lot of exposure. Not to mention DEVcon is in a week. 
But sure, go ahead and sell it if you don't really believe in the project. 
@_date: 2015-10-16 15:53:00
The question is whether Bitcoin is the blockchain that is used to implement those other usecases. Sidechains *may* empower Bitcoin to expand on it's capabilities but it's becoming quite clear it's going to be difficult to make changes to the core protocol. I don't think there really is anything wrong with *just* being the currency on the internet. That's a pretty great (and valuable) use case to solve. 
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:45:10
I agree that an open, permission-less blockchain is *more* valuable than a closed, permissioned blockchain but that doesn't mean permissioned blockchains have no value. 
Companies find value in intranets but no one argues that they're more valuable than the internet. 
@_date: 2016-07-21 11:17:36
... this would go over well with mainstream users.
@_date: 2016-07-23 13:17:49
There's a loud minority of Bitcoin users, investors and developers who will not budge on the blocksize. Fees are going up and competition is increasing. If action isn't taken, the majority of users, investors and developers will move on from Bitcoin. 
In action *is* stalling. I think (my opinion) Bitcoin will fork but it's going to be contentious and it will be pretty obvious after the fact how small the minority of people against an increase in the blocksize really is. 
Many thought the Ethereum HF was going to be contentious and sure there is ETHC for now but the difficulty continues to fall to the point where the old chain is completely dead. As of this post ETHC has .6% the difficulty of the main ETH chain. It's not a matter of if the old chian will die, it's when. And to think a week ago there were many touting unsubstantiated numbers that 20% of the ETH community was against the fork....
