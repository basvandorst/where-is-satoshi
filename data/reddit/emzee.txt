If it wasn't for bitcoin, I could never afford to donate today. and I only donated a small portion of my profits from the last 30 days.
But that's not really important I guess. for once I like to see bitcoin headlines that are not about hackers and ransomwares attacking hospitals and innocent people. this is our window to let people know we are not all same.

Don't hate BCH. forks are normal process of nature. otherwise you make your sources closed. what doesn't kill something, makes it stronger. eventually this will contribute to the greater good.
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:44:51
Of course you should. People need help now and there is no time for holding bitcoin, so if you can/want to donate to charities active in Texas, do it now! check the attached post for details.
But I thought it would be really interesting for bitcoin to make the headlines once for a good cause. I think on fundraising websites, what encourages people to donate is that they can see how much money is collected. with bitcoin that's very easier to see and track. so press could simply cite the bitcoin address in their headlines.

I am just a user and I will follow whatever that is easier to work with. thanks to Coinbase, that's BTC for now. but branchings give strength to OPEN projects.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:14:51
And their rates are so high...
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:48:56
The only option is currently Red Cross through Bitpay. I am not sure if they support that. also I believe my own linked address doesn't support it either... anyway pm me a list of subreddit that might find this helpful.

I think what encourages people to donate to fundraising websites is that they can see how much money is collected. with bitcoin that's very easier to see and track. I have not used the Bitpay's Red Cross method but I think they won't collect funds to one address, so it is not possible to see the real donations and efforts being made.
All it takes for this charities to accept bitcoin is adding a bitcoin address to their website...
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:51:42
Yes, through Bitpay page which I attached. if you google "donate bitcoin red cross" it is the first result.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:24:09
This might actually work for me. Thanks, I'll try it.
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:42:40
It is mentioned in the FAQ: 
Also if you search in this sub you will find a post from a user who contacted red cross and they referred him to bitpay.
But why do you want to give to red cross anyway? you can never be sure how they spend the money. use a Shift card or any bitcoin debit card to give to a local charity.
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:10:11
 Did they require photo ID or any other kind of verification?
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:52:47


Or technophobics?
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:16:34
But Canada is a different story. trading is much easier in the US. even for newbies.
@_date: 2017-07-30 23:35:47
Hmm the more I learn, it gets more complicated... doing this may have privacy concerns because I am not using random servers, right?
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:59:31
Thank you, that's reassuring!
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:33:01
I know that works now - but what about in 5 years if electrum servers are not around - should I just export my xpriv instead of seed?
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:03:58
Each new wallet you make, restore or import, has its own key. they are not same and should not be.
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:59:33
Hmm. Thank you! I wish I had started learning these sooner.
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:19:53
BTW, why do people need Electrum's cold storage when they can simply have a PC that only need to be online for syncing?
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:08:27
FIAT is Italian!
There is a bitcoin sub for Canada also check out Kraken or QuadrigaCX and see if there are any [ATM]( close to you.
@_date: 2017-07-30 23:53:59
Fortunately I don't intend to move out funds any time soon, so I might also be able to upgrade. but in case I couldn't, how would you trust a server or check it before making any tx? where are servers listed anyway?
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:00:58
I am a newbie, just started using electrum two days ago. so let me ask this in another way: how do you generate a paper wallet?
If I print/write my xpub and xpriv from electrum on a paper, couldn't it be called a paper wallet? what's the difference?
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:45:43
The seed is ONLY valid for one wallet. the one you got the seed when creating it.
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:16:41


Very true.
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:40:11
Would I be safe from this if I am using a 2.9 offline wallet plus 2.8 watch-only wallet? couldn't upgrade to 2.9 yet...
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:35:53
Just FYI. if you ever imported any keys into a blockchain.info wallet, make sure to also move the funds to the new wallet addresses as advised, otherwise if you loose control of your wallet for any reason, you have no way for recovering your funds from the imported addresses, hence the warning "imported addresses are not backed up by your recovery phase."
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:56:49
Good to know I am not alone. Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:22:04
I don't have any PC that has never been online - is it safer to use Linux installed on a USB?
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:10:05
Are you using 2fa?
See this: 
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:17:27
Generally, you don't sell bitcoin, HODL.
But my advice is, transfer small amounts back to Coinbase whenever you wish to sell. and then transfer back to your own storage.
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:43:53
I wish you are right. so far there is no sign of drop and I missed the opportunity to buy at 1900 last week... I shouldn't have waited for Aug 1...
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:39:44
What are you talking about?!!
Electrum Bitcoin Wallet &gt;  &lt; This!
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:23:15
Electrum on Linux? would it make any difference if I use Linux which is installed on a USB?
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:42:51
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:00:10
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:47:34
How is my solution different than a paper wallet? I am still going to write down the seed (or xprv?!) on paper. but this allows me to also monitor incoming funds on my watch-only wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:06:36
I don't. always used online wallets and now I am just confused.
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:55:55
Maybe. see I am even buying one of these: Just kidding. but I will regret it for months if I unknowingly change my BTC to some other coin...
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:03:31
But block explorers only show tx for one known address. electrum is HD, it would be hard to keep track of all the addresses.
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:42:03
I am not concerned about Aug 1 - with Coinbase stating that they don't support UAHF, I feel safe, knowing that they have major control over the market and whatever side they are will be THE Bitcoin - but in general, I wish it was possible to collect (?) all transactions under one chain.
Sorry if it sounds weird, I probably have no idea what I am saying.
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:40:11
Thank you, I will check the list. 


Is this associated with No-IP ?
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:21:37
No, as I said I am going to format the USB. no wallet. just the seed. do I need anything else, like wallet file or a back up of electrum application?
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:12:50


I have used this on Linux and it seems everything was good. but trying to verify the same tarball on gpg for windows, I get the "key not valid" message. not sure what is going on or if I did something wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-30 23:09:53


What do you mean? this is Electrum, not a new wallet. so only server is to blame... right?
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:49:09
I am a newbie and I have no idea what is in the future of bitcoin - but for now, for August 1st, I don't know what people are worry about? with Coinbase and other major exchanges making their mind, it is already clear which chain is the Bitcoin.
Problem is, cheap coins seem to be unlikely anytime soon...
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:34:49
Why would anyone skip and not use certain addresses? even if they do, isn't it always possible to use it later?
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:38:35
I assume they were imported from the old blockchain.info wallets. AFAIK this is normal with them. all one have to do is to move funds to new addresses which are backed up by the recovery phrase/seed/
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:59:03
You are very welcome! I don't use Electrum. when beginning to use 2FA, is the fee mentioned somewhere? is it a fixed 0.002 BTC fee regardless of fiat value of BTC?
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:35:42


Is this future-proof? can I use these to restore wallet anytime regardless of the technology.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:20:26
Not sure what they mean by 'same'. but it suggests that two applications should not be installed on one machine. use different OS, Linux on USB...
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:27:29
3547 is the year a better Bitcoin alternative will be invented. bitcoin will be dead.
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:42:10
Pretty scary. Would I be safe from this if I am using a 2.9 offline wallet plus 2.8 watch-only wallet? couldn't upgrade to 2.9 yet...
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:48:20
I know it sounds weird, I have no idea how it works. but I also never thought anything like bitcoin would be possible.
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:22:02
But it isn't released yet...
@_date: 2017-07-11 19:47:23
What about for recovery in case I lost my PC - is it possible? can I print a recovery phrase or something to import my wallet into any other client or online wallet like Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:14:59
I tried reading their documentations on their website but I got more confused - why do people need cold storage with Electrum when they can simply have a PC that only need to be online for syncing?
A short time being online couldn't be that harmful, could it?!
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:33:11
Somewhere I read about a 20-something address limit (not sure what or where). what if I use more than 100 addresses?
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:06:56
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-06-29 12:15:25
There's a rule: if you have to ask about mining, it's not for you. ofc people who know what they're doing could still benefit from it.
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:42:01
Okay... but why this is replied to my post?!
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:08:45
Thanks for the tip. I must read more about the "gap limit".
