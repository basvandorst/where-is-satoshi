It is literally already is that easy.  Google HAS embraced it, it's called Google wallet linked to gmail.  It allows you to literally send emails of money.  Paypal...literally emails of money.  Snapchat has Snapcash, to literally email money.  
And because of the above reasons, we realize why bitcoin is not getting adoption.  It doesn't do anything new.  People can already send money to friends with existing tools.  There's no need for bitcoin.

This isn't "financial press".  This is literally a blog.

Sorry but that's just not true.  The iPhone came out in 2007 and by 2013 smart phones had billions of users.  The iPad is just 5 years old and tablets are slated to have over a billion users in 2015.  Ebay, Paypal, and Amazon, all had 10s of millions of users in 6 years.  If bitcoin is truly revolutionary, 6 years in today's fast paced life is ample time to succeed.
Those are real exponential trends.  If bitcoin was in full steam ahead mode, there would be no price decline and this subreddit wouldn't be losing traffic every month.  Period.  If there were loads of new users every single day to this community, the price would reflect it.  And it's not....it's that simple, it really is.  Bubble or no bubble, the Nov 2013 bubble is popped, and we're still seeing extremely low volumes and no demand for coins.

Wow this is great news.  After the entire world swooned to dogecoin after their NASCAR sponsorship, I expect bitcoin to follow in dogecoin's footsteps.  Soon my grandma will have a bitcoin wallet next to her dogecoin wallet!
Just kidding, all the advertising in the world doesn't create real world use cases for bitcoin.  And until that happens, bitcoin can never succeed in any meaningful way.

I think we do.  And it's under 500 thousand users.  I wouldn't call that massive.  As a global market on the internet is concerned, that's insignificant at best.  We're in the days with billions of internet users.  With viral social media.  And yet...500k users.  Clearly not taking off like everyone here thinks/expects it is.  And it surely isn't massive by any stretch of the imagination.

Yes and what a great business model they have.  So profitable, wish I would have thought it up.  I mean if you add up every penny sent using changetip in its entire history, you don't even come up with even 100k.  So their 3.5 million in VC would take approximiately 35 current company lifetimes to pay back if they charged a 100% fee on every transaction.  Wow that's a business that will surely be THRIVING in 2016!  I look forward to seeing what other stellar apps they come out with in the future.

Yes it's massively wasteful.  A centralized system could process every transaction on the bitcoin network without any latency or delays.....with ONE single server.  However, the way the bitcoin network is setup now requires quite literally the most energy intensive computing network in the entire world to process those transactions.  Literally, the biggest energy consuming network in the world is doing the task a single server tucked away in a data center could do.  It's definitely massively wasteful, I will give you that.
