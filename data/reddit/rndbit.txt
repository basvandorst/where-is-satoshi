Crap spyware competes with crap spyware. Sounds legit.

Think 2100,000,000,000,000 units of currency would not be enough?

A mobile chatting application. Seriously, no desktop app? Then it claims privacy but yet is closed source. And people are supposed to trust that. Well they will find some people using it but all in all it wont take market by storm because of how useless it actually is. I would opt in for telegram instead of this and i dont like telegram. There are better alternatives in development.

You dont agree with government - you are a terrorist.

Suuuure. Skype is also secure. You take care believing all that :) Popular!=secure. Quite contrary..

Probably so. My point is - telegram is not good choice either. They while preaching privacy require user's phone number. And also are not opensource even though they semi-claim to be such. UI clients are opensrc but core is still closed. They promised to open it later but i have no idea why they cant do it now. There must be secret agenda. Secret agenda does not mix well with promise of privacy.

Use block chain for all the things \o/ No matter of it fits the application or not! Its a ledger, not a storage space ffs.

Block chain pets - I smell money coming your way :D

Loving downvotes. They must come from people that think file storage on blockchain is a good idea. Blockchain is not some kind of panacea so stop treating it as such.
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:54:38
When I hear a thing uses blockchain I immediately think it will be retarded crap. Simply because people misuse it 99% of the time.

Safer? Yeah right... Especially when for exit nodes sniff the hell out of passing traffic. Lots of web still not HTTPS you know so let's not be naive.

"World's safest OS..." And my bullshit siren goes WOOT WOOOT WOOOOOT.

Given Tails routes everything through tor... It does. A lot. Trusting Tails is opsec failure.
