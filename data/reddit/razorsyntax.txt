Does it make sense to compensate node owners? Say, we need more nodes, wouldn’t the possibility of earning something, like mining does, aid in incentivizing more node operatoring participation?  Just thinking out loud here. I’m not up to speed on the current thinking behind why it’s set up the way that it is.

How much does a setup like that cost?

What’s the point of smoking plants that can get you imprisoned? What’s the point of using encryption where it’s becoming illegal (Australia, etc)?  What’s the point of doing anything if we can’t get the crowns blessing first?  What’s the point of doing anything if we’re going to be afraid of upsetting government?
I know this isn’t a popular thought, but what if we tried promoting living free?

Many symbols are all wrong toward the end of the video.

I disagree with the word “Can’t” in the title primarily because the government will always find a way to do whatever it wants to do. They’ll change the Bill of Rights if they have the support behind them (like they did in the early 1900’s).  I agree with the premise of the article but it should have pointed out that even if governments were successful in regulation, it would have almost (note the word “almost”) no way to enforce it for the same reason laws against piracy are virtually unenforcable.
Bitcoin has made central banking and government fiat obsolete. Now we just sit back, hodl, and watch in slow motion as the legacy financial world tears itself apart trying to control it.

Why ban? Information research shouldn’t mean ban. Especially if it’s mere compare and contrasting.

Apologies. I should’ve been more accurate by referring to you as a “fascist”.
@_date: 2019-04-20 22:11:12
I understand. You're trying to make me seem like I don't know what I'm talking about. But facts don't care about your opinions. CNN is government propaganda.

If BTC is sub $10 million, it’s always a good time for me to buy Bitcoin.

I refer to national currenices as shitcoins, or if I find myself in pleasant company, I’ll call them scamcoins.  The US Dollar is about as trustworthy as Bitconnect.
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:03:50
Seems legit.
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:08:10
Same here. Would love to know. 
@_date: 2019-04-09 02:01:19
Totally agree. Regulation is unnecessary and immoral.  That said, we can take comfort that Bitcoin itself, like piracy, can’t be stopped through regulation.  Innovation, on the other hand, will slow to a crawl wherever regulation exists.
@_date: 2019-04-20 18:28:12
Man, that’s not even true anymore.  CNN and Fox are about as factual as The Onion.  Fortunately, there are tons of alternative online independent news outlets to choose from that report facts, not just government propoganda.

I’m definitely here to get rich. There’s nothing wrong with accumulating massive wealth.  No shame in having a fortune.

He fails to recognize the superstition made manifest of scientism. The main stream scientists are the modern day priest class which tells the rest of us how the world works the same way the religious priest clases use to and, in general, we simply take them at their word.
I’ll take the cautiously superstitious over the dogmatic sciences any day. One favors open thinking, the other rigid and often dangerous. (Once the supertitious becomes dogmatic, they become equivalent)

And there it is. Your totalitarian, liberal bias. Right on queue. Almost as if to say, “hey, I don’t think for myself so I believe everything mainsteam popular news says because being right wing means bad. Derp!”
@_date: 2019-04-07 23:49:17
What you're referring to is the tool known as science.  I'm not referring to that at all. Please do some research on scientism before posting. 
As for fact-checking, theoretical physics (big bang, dark matter, universal expansion, etc) is about as factual as any other superstition and definitely stretches credulity. Science is a tool, not a bible- we can't treat it like it is.

Specifically Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-04-21 13:58:11
I realize that might be new to you, but the rest us already knew that. Liberals who watch CNN are always last to know truth. But I'm glad you made it.

Realizing a free market is not a zero-sum game helped me not become a maximalist.

There should be a software which tracks Bitcoin transactions made from/to government.  Hmmm...
@_date: 2019-04-09 01:45:08
It’s coming. We definitely need better UI/UX than telling people to set up their own node, connecting to Tor, storing their bitcoin in cold storage, then having their parents drive them to a field out side of town where they bury their ledger under a full moon using predefined, yet encrypted, gps coordinates.
Accessibility means making it dead simple.
Why do you ask? Are you hiring? I’m a developer with UI/UX skills.

That’s not how that works. lol

Ah. Fees as incentive! That makes sense.
@_date: 2019-04-09 02:29:02
I realize this is a can of worms for some people but can someone calmly explain the reason behind the high transaction fees during the 2018 run up to 20k. Can it happen again? Is LN the only solution to ensure low fees during the next run?  Is there a solid reason for high tx fees during runs?
@_date: 2019-04-13 20:39:00
It’s whatever people want it to be based on however it is they want to use it. If it means getting rich, then that’s what it means. If it means circumventing authoritarianism, then that’s what it means.

You’re right. I agree.

Makes sense. I can definitely see that.

Sounds like a business opportunity to me. A subscription service could be way more cost effecient for the user, as opposed to a percentage of the set.  Eventually, the right model will make it more financially worth it for both customer and developer.  Just takes time to get there.
@_date: 2019-05-06 22:34:53
Even if they all agreed to stop it, they still couldn’t stop.  Piracy is illegal worldwide and all countries have agreed to stop it and yet it’s never been easier and more popular to do than right now.
