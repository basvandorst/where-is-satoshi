just fyi: You always see some noisy value somewhere close to the real one. Comparing 2 with 0 does not really work. Just keep hitting F5 and see how the votes keep changing
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:34:41
Can someone Eli5 why those are fake votes?
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:15:33
he might know about Segwit (the concept itself is quite old) but not the recent shift of the hash rate (0-2 days ago).  
Sure he might be a shill, but just calling everyone a shill kinda makes it impossible to actually call people out
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:30:11
It's not Luke-Approved™ , tho. So use it at your own risk
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:58:51
He ignores that the improvement rate is 17% compared to the last year, while 52GB/year is only 35% currently and will decrease over time.  
Since we can already handle 1MB, it'll only get better
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:32:40
weird, right? Everything he doesn't like with votes has to be manipulated
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:51:25
I really don't get this thread. They actually start blaming the miners for full blocks now
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:26:54
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:31:44
ah, good to know
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:57:03
So you'll just discredit anyone complaining about too high fees? Come on
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:32:38
They even forked just to fake wanting to increase the limit. Genius
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:31:13
I'm really glad we waited with the block sizes increases until everything is on fire. Especially since LN will save us all anyway (some day, maybe)
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:57:06
just everyone supporting this raise your hand so we can identify those spam transactions to drop
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:28:48
Just burn your paper wallet. Won't be able to spend it anyway
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:50:19
^ redditor for 1 week shill, go get him!
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:51:03
also if Core were to implement 8MB, you could directly buy coffee. It's not an 8MB issue, it's a "new fork" issue
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:33:30
He has the Me/We disorder
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:48:46
Why would a Roger Ver shill talk positive about Segwit?
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:03:22
I think without the adjustment BCH would have been dead already. I guess something similar to the adjustment code but which gets weakened every adjustment until it's gone would have been optimal
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:01:02
The time I wasted to seriously respond to you :D Please ignore my previous posts
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:55:32
the latter
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:32:39
shouldn't have voted for him then
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:42:40
I could have sworn that miners fighting tooth and nail to get the block size increased
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:36:18
I'm pretty sure the problem could be reduced to different settings in a config file / header which are the only difference between e.g. the Core / Cash / x2 compatible chain.  
So the maintenance overhead would be rather small actually
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:14:54
But you claim an attack was happening which Core could easily prevent. So either it's not an issue or Core could act. Saying it's 'not their objective' is nonesense at this point
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:24:18
You even misquote me there. I'm obviously trolling and going back to the forest
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:54:57
The blockchain is already too big, no decrease in block size will fix this.  
Just start a new alt with 10KB blocks and see how it goes
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:48:35
what stops core from also offering a Bitcoin Cash or Segwit2x compatible client? Nobody would be able to "kicked them out"
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:09:11
Core can still be Core and doesn't have to remove anything. They can offer alternative clients without dropping their main one. I'm done with this discussion, it's going in circles at this point  
Also Core can't get fired if they offer compatible, alternative clients
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:28:00
Maybe the fees are high because people try to get their BTC to exchanges to sell them.  
The fees are no reflection of the demand, they simply represent movement * value
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:52:53
Both sharing the same PoW algorithm makes things even worse. With each split the entire system gets more fragile
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:10:10
And yet the initial argument was that evil forces are going to push their clients down people's throats
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:58:52
If the attack consists of getting users to install another client / malware, then what is stopping Core from offering compatible, trusted and secure alternatives?
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:54:19
I think there's quite many who like SegWit and Lightning but still think that 1MB is too little
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:33:08
With their insane tactics, capital and agents, they tried to get the block size limit to 2MB. True evil
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:26:32
wouldn't that have resulted in a direct and crazy increase which would then never drop down again?
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:53:16
His math ignores the fact that the processing improvement grows 17% exponentially, while the block chain grows lineary if the block size stays the same.  
And since we can already handle 1 MB (Bitcoin is up and running), we can easily handle it in the future
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:48:38
we are ready for 1mb and have been since Bitcoin was created
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:27:33
Or maybe without crazy high fees the value of BTC would have been way higher now
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:11:20
Do you think the current transaction fees are helpful or harmful?
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:31:42
Yes, they'll change now. But my advice against comparing really close upvote counts on reddit still stands.  
Just check some older posts / comments in dead threads and you'll see them change all the time.
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:51:37
Just check these out:

That's not what I'm saying.  
If someone was offering a fork of Windows with a dark theme instead of a light one, and Microsoft would fear that a huge part of its userbase would switch over to the fork just for the dark theme, even if the fork might contain malware, then Microsoft could simply offer a switch for a dark theme.  
You claim that the goal of the competing forks is to get users to use their client. Core could easily prevent this by offering a compatible client.  
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:06:17
Also I could have sworn that SegWit was supposed to solve this? Amazing how everything changes within 2-3 days.  
"We don't need x2, SegWit is the increase. Lol SegWit doesn't really help, why would you idiots think that?"
