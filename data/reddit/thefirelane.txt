Umm.. what?  Gold is 'backed by' physics, in that it can't be counterfeited.  If that's what you mean by bitcoin being 'backed by' mathematics.  Given a choice between the two actually, the physics behind gold is much more solid than the math behind bitcoin.
As for the value of both bitcoin and gold, nothing.. neither math nor physics 'backs' their value.  Value is derived from other people's want for something... no more, no less.

just an FYI, the US dollar is the official currency of countries other than the US

how is anything you're describing functionally different than existing cashless bank transfers?

I think you continue to miss my point: Property law doesn't care about how 'cool' or 'what great features' your property has, that is irrelevant.   It simply deals with who owns what, and what is stolen.
Features and 'advantages' are irrelevant... whether you have a smart phone, or a rock, both are "simple property" in that someone is not legally allowed to steal them from you.  The same holds true for bitcoins.  In that respect, bitcoins are indeed "simple property". 
They are possessions.  They can be bought, sold, or stolen, therefore they fall under normal property law.

Ah, interesting.  So why aren't all thefts reported or handled in this way.  The specific case I'm thinking of is this one:
Where the guy simply says: "I won't report it, its impossible to trace".  That is what triggered my question... although it is impossible to figure who holds them now, if they move to a legitimate holder, there is a chance of getting them back... so why not report it?
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:01:29
Sorry, this is factually incorrect: Laws against theft predate central banks by thousands of years.
Indeed they even predate currency, so whatever point you are trying to make, that somehow we've invented something that will make laws irrelevant, is simply wrong.
Murder, theft, and the like were illegal before banks, and even currency, and would remain so even after.
Anyway, reply if you want, I don't think I will be continuing in this thread, as based on your previous reply, there isn't much to anticipate in the way of productive conversation.

Notice I did not say *all* the doors, however locking emergency exits in a theater is still illegal, even if there are 'normal' exits still available... hence not kidnapping
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:09:40
For your first point... 100% wrong, it is still illegal to expose yourself to underage children, even if done on private property.. even your own.  I'm really surprised this even needs to be explained.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:31:38


My point was exposing ones self to those underage is indeed illegal.


Read again, I paired matchstick factory with oil refinery... I'm quite sure that wouldn't meet zoning laws.  I was going to say fireworks factory with an upstairs kindergarten, but didn't feel like using "think of the children" again.


No, again, I'm not.  The porno watching kindergarten teacher would indeed be charged with breaking the law.... and probably should be, even though he's doing two things which are individually legal.


Again, this is an odd path of argument, and really doesn't make sense... since the reason I, and many other people, don't do illegal things isn't simply because of "the rules"... but rather because we understand the negative consequences to ourselves and others.
However, the reason we have laws are for the very individuals that don't, and who do engage in risky and threatening behavior.
That's exactly my point: the reason these things are illegal is because the majority of society which **doesn't** engage in these behaviors, also wants other to not engage in them... **before** the negative consequences are manifested... and not to simply wait around, to say: "yes, he finally killed someone, now we can do something"... out of some highly abstract and nonsensical idea of "fighting tyranny" or "oppression"
@_date: 2013-06-06 20:50:57
There are plenty of laws I support, and plenty of ones I don't, but as I said before, my personal opinions are not relevant to the discussion of his central point.
An argument should have merit on its own basis, it's simple logic.
Anyway, since you've decided to go entirely ad hominem in your last reply, I'm not expecting further productive discussion, so I probably won't be replying further, just so you're not waiting.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:40:58
Sorry, I really don't have time for that, and it's really beside the point (already your first reply was in all honesty)
You've missed/avoided my central point:  It is not morally wrong to make something illegal if it has a high risk, and massive negative consequences.
For example: using your logic, it should be perfectly legal to set up a target on one side of a busy highway, and then shoot a rifle across the highway from the other side.
Society has realized that only punishing risky behavior 'after the fact' doesn't help the person killed, and it's not immoral to stop someone who is highly likely to kill someone.
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:27:56
But that is exactly my point: the stolen property is still stolen if innocent people have it, so they must return it.. Which might make some people nervous about bitcoin in general
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:48:05
my point being: no it doesn't... it is simply like property like all other kinds.
@_date: 2013-06-06 19:46:53


Sorry, but that is pure and utter bullshit and there is no other way to say it: you are saying there are absolutely zero studies done on drunk driving and the effect of DUI laws on drunk driving.  
You made the claim, please back that up.
On second thought, why bother?... since you're willing to accept something I thought was patently and obviously absurd, I might as well go further and see if you'll accept it:
Under the logic you propose (it shouldn't be illegal until someone is harmed)... do you think it is immoral for society to illegalize personal nuclear bomb ownership?  
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:50:40
hint to readers:  In the previous post the writer switches from "likely" to "more likely" to "might"... and tries to pass them all off as equivalent.
Making something illegal that is "likely" to lead to someone's death is not immoral.
It is also not the equivalent to making something illegal which "might" lead to someone's death.
@_date: 2013-06-06 19:55:41
So just to be clear: you feel it is "morally wrong" to make personal atomic bomb construction and ownership illegal?
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:45:25


You might be shocked to learn that a family would react negatively (and vote accordingly) if told by the police: "Oh yeah, your son was broadsided and killed by Joe, a notorious red light running, drunk driver... we've seen him do it a bunch of times, but didn't stop him... because... you know... liberty!"
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:45:59
Just to clarify: the point of ECC and decentralization was to overcome the limitations and trust problems with a digital currency.  The entire point of it is very much to make it "simply like" other property, which automatically solves this issue: For instance, gold is 'decentralized' and verifiable. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 20:11:10
Thanks for your reply.  I just wanted to make sure that further discussion/debate is indeed useless.
If you honestly think that laws preventing the construction of massive bombs by individuals are somehow "an infrigment of liberty" that shouldn't be permitted... and that those individuals should **only** be arrested **after** they've vaporized an entire city... well there really isn't much point in further discussion. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:02:50
Honestly, this article reads like it was written by someone in their late teens or at best early twenties who have absolutely no clue about society as a whole, the broader implications of what they're talking about, or how easily their ill thought out logic could be applied to anything really.
For example:


This is the central thesis of the article, and it's biggest weakness.  The author really expects us to believe that only negative consequences should be illegal, but not the behaviors that often (and sometimes inevitably) lead to them.  
With this mentality... doing absolutely anything should be legal.  Want to run red lights?  No problem, as long as you don't hit anyone.  Want to drive around tossing sticks of dynamite out of your car?  Absolutely fine, if they happen to miss everyone the cops have no business stopping you.  Firing a gun randomly into a crowd... no problem also, the cops should simply watch you, and only intervene if you actually hit someone.  Since murder is illegal, but simply firing a gun isn't
Of course, this retroactive justice **really doesn't help the dead guy**... does it?  This is, quite obviously, what every single other member of society has realized... and why we've decided to make firing guns into public crowds illegal.


Are you 100% sure that is **actually** a crime.  I'm not 100% sure either, but driving a truck drunk on private property might not actually be illegal.


Again, if this is your criteria for "made up"... this is a fun game to play.  Let's think of legal things, which are only illegal when paired... apparently OP thinks they're fine:
Being naked : being near children
Having a matchstick/fireworks factory : refining oil
teaching kindergarten: watching porn
Locking doors : Operating a theatre
Honestly, your concept of "made up crimes" is simply not well thought through, and quite sophomoric.


No, because not all risks are equal, both in consequence and likelihood.  Again, this is obvious with more than 2 minutes of thought.


You've just refuted your entire thesis with this sentence.  Proof read next time.
The point you **should** be trying to make isn't that money laundering "shouldn't be a crime" and it's just "the man" out to oppress you.  It is that bitcoin can be used for illegal purposes, and can be used for legal purposes, much like cars or knives.... neither of which are wholly illegal simply due to possible illegal usage.
@_date: 2013-06-06 18:04:26


Other means... such as?  The law is exactly the tool a larger social group uses to "stop people".  What else would you suggest?  Vigilantism?  Unfriending him on facebook?  Not inviting him to birthday parties?
This is exactly why your thesis fails: you are trying to create a magical solution which stops people's negative and dangerous behavior, but is also somehow also optional.
Of course, the reason we have laws in the first place is because such a solution simply doesn't exist or work.
@_date: 2013-06-06 19:41:29
I'm sorry, but I honestly don't know how to phrase it any clearer: you are arguing that even if they **are doing it,** they shouldn't be stopped.
That is a different point entirely from what you just wrote, which is laws aren't what stop people from doing that now.
Two entirely separate points, you are confusing them.
What would happen now, is if someone tried that, the police would be called, and they would be stopped **before** they killed someone, **not after**... as you are proposing should be the case.
@_date: 2013-06-06 20:04:56


Not an excuse.  His request for me to research 6 laws is beside the point.  The central theme of the thread was his argument that two legal things should always be legal to do simultaneously.
I quite correctly showed cases where that should not be the case, and instead of refuting my points he asked me to research 6 laws for his amusement.  That was not the central topic of the thread... hence "off topic"
@_date: 2013-06-06 19:54:02
None of what you said is true actually.
If you'll notice, the request was off topic.  My reply was a rebuttal of his two main points: That any two legal activities should be legal to do together/simultaneously, and that laws shouldn't exist to try to prevent harm.
@_date: 2013-06-06 20:54:47
I did already, you even admitted so yourself earlier for some of them, but then became confused by semantics for others:  
Exposing yourself to underage children (which aren't yours, obviously) 
1. Being visible in public to children which aren't yours: legal
2. Being naked: legal
1+2: simultaneously: illegal.. your definition for "made up crime"
Locking fire exits in theatres:
1. Operating a theatre: legal
2. Locking a door: legal
1+2: simultaneously: illegal.. your definition for "made up crime"
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:46:47
My point wasn't really about forcibly recovering the coins.  Rather it was, couldn't certain coins be 'marked' as stolen, so if any legitimate business or person does have them, they would be required to hand them over.
Think of it more like a stolen car.  You report it stolen, but obviously that doesn't 'force' who ever it is to bring it back... however if you see it on a dealership lot for sale... you get it back.
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:29:59
Two seconds of googling will show you: Yes, virginia, people can, and have been arrested for exposing themselves to trick-or-treaters. (as they should be, by the way)
Sorry, this discussion has reached a really stupid level, I probably won't be participating further.
@_date: 2013-06-06 18:10:59


This is an extremely weak line of argument.  You are essentially saying: since we can't stop every instance, don't try to stop any instance.
Again, the stupidity of that statement, and it's lack of resonance with voters (immagine that) was my previous point, and your reply side stepped that.
