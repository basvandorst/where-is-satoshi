As someone who also served time for cyber crime, I totally support the guy :). Time will pass, once he goes free again he should just enjoy his 1.5 million pounds. Stay strong bro!

This is the address for anyone interested.

I don’t have files, I have the xpub key in text format. I will try loading into another wallet.

I don’t have the necessary knowledge.

No it is not the wallet, it is one of the hundred addresses that the faulty script fetches.

I checked it with my BTC address? I don’t know how to check it with the master key.

Did it with the help of the user :). Great programmer, recommended. Link for the slight probability someone else will need this in the future (updated recover.js):

Any precise info on that? I’m not really sure how that can be accomplished.

That is not the BTC address. It’s just a address the script (original one) fetches.

Proudly saying we have one in Romania too which looks exactly like this, even the interface. It's located in Iasi, at the 1st floor of Iulius Mall. The only one in the country and I've sold at it over 1 BTC in the last two weeks. Easiest way to get cash from Bitcoins in my opinion.
EDIT: Realised this one only has the option to buy BTC, can't sell :(.
