I agree with what you are saying. Price comes down to the buyers vs the sellers, the winner determines the price.

To me it seems like there has been a explosion in use case the past year, you are starting to see multiple mom and pop style shops accept crypto world wide. It's definitely not on a mass scale but it's definitely alot more then when btc was @ 20k. I still believe there we'll be a sub 3k price for btc but it will be a very short lived price and bounce back fast. 20k was definitely over priced but if you take into account all that is happened in the world with crypto now my opinion is we aren't over priced at this level.

I guess he doesn't want to be noted saying a coin and somewhere down the road if that coin fails then he will look stupid.

I think you can come up with a hundred reasons why something won't happened and it does. 
I'm not saying that it will drop or won't drop under 2k but I'm tied of seeing post that have no real weight on the market. No fud just saying there is no solid evidence that it won't drop.

Concrete work, i do a lot of demo, jack hammering/grinding/milling/ and sealing, so i'm required to wear all different type of respirators if my beard gets to a certain point and someone from osha is working around the job and noticed its a big ass fine ( 7k first time 70k second time) so i dont play around with that lol.

Aside from the people that just want to skyrocket back to ath, I think everyone would like to buy sub 1k Bitcoin again. I would like to buy anything under 2500 being honest and I have buy orders in place for that but I also bought alot once it went under 3500 too just being safe. If it goes to 20k or higher I'm going to care more about not buy because I was waiting for a lower price then buying
