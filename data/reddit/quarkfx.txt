Lol, you have no idea what impact auroracoin had in the media. Did a great job to educate people about crypto.

so do the people from Iceland

btw. Bitcoin lost 12% value in the last 24h. Just sayin...

Actually Bitcoin looks pretty boring. Peercoin is currently a good ride. Check out coinmarketcap

yeah...what´s the difference....maybe just look it up. Do you have a family? Don´t you feel stronger relation to your familiy than to the random Joe on the street? Well, then you´re probably racist in your eyes.
Of course, nations are fictions but those fictions are real in a sense because they have real impact. Even more if they are small like the icelandic nation. If you studied the history of Iceland (in terms of: the last 6 years) you would understand why the introduction of a new national currency isn´t in any way racist. Iceland as a country and nation was obligated to pay sums they would have never been able to pay because of their banking system. They didn´t and were isolated. 
I am not from Iceland but it is so obvious why a national crypto makes totally sense. Not because you can´t trade it everywhere but because the real value of ANY currency is determined by real use beyond geeks. idk what idea people in this thread have about the acceptance of Bitcoin. Even though there is an obvious development in the infrastructure Bitcoin is still a Nerd-thing and a long walk from being mainstream in any way. 
This ignorant Altcoin bashing is contraproductive for all crypto.

That is an awesome platform. The Quark community currently uses Trello which looks similar but has no option for votings. 
What if people receive votes in relation to their share in BTC? They would sign a message with their BTC address and receive votes in relation to that share. I think that would be a fair approach allowing everyone  to participate in relation to their shares while forcing large shareholders to make their stakes transparent.

Lol, why is it a scamcoin again? Because it´s not Bitcoin? :D

"there must be a reason why the product failed"
like Google Wave?
Maybe people just had no interest in this type of product when it was launched. Ever thought about that?

Could we have a rebuttal somewhere in a place where it doesn´t disappear?

I read about this game on the Quarkcoin subreddit. Quark is listed as one of the currencies that are "supported" as Bitcoin, Litecoin and other Altcoins on their Kickstarter page. Today I [read about the game on steamcommunity.com]( and there is **not one word about other currencies than Dogecoin**. 
Obviously I don´t know the strategies of the developers but to me it looks as if they want to create a game to push Doge, but want to get fundings from other communities. Also the "rational" arguments why they chose Dogecoin over other coins are not convincing in any way to me.
The whole idea looks pretty neat and it could be an awesome crypto game, but the fact that they only listed other coins on the Kickstarter page looks misguiding and fishing for money support.

I know other places that accept 0 confirmation but this is because Bitcoin and crypto in general is a geek thing and the transactions are so low that double spend doesn´t make a lot of sense. I am pretty sure that it will be a barrier for mainstream adoptance. Enterprises won´t rely on 0 confirmations. Actually many don´t accept 0 confirmations already. 
You can´t tell merchants to use a "safer" currency and then to relinquish safety.

Uhm...why does it say 0.32 something $? Did you photoshop the image and forgot about that?
@_date: 2014-03-27 10:33:29
Sorry guys but how stupid can you be to play the Bitcoin fanboy and make fun of projects that promote the use of cryptos in real life? Seriously, you missed the point about what crypto is. A shame.

There is a difference between being rich and being a shareholder.
Also, making the voting transparent allow smaller shareholders to mobilize easily.
