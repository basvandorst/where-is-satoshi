The term is "foreign bank account".

No, it is a problem if you want to buy or sell a lot and don't want to move the price.

Umm... that's the whole point.  Bitcoin has a set inflation schedule that eventually tapers to 0%.  By cashing out of your local currency and into bitcoin you protect yourself against your local currency's inflation.

No way, that's crazy talk.  Get some perspective.
Inflation occurs when governments spend more money than they get in taxes.  It is the secret tax that balances the budget.  Banks are part of this process, essentially they launder the money by dressing it up in a bunch of loans and such.
So we know that inflation occurs because the government wants it to happen.  In a hyperinflation scenario, do you think that the government would allow you to use bitcoin?  FDR confiscated all of people's gold when he wanted to begin massively inflating the dollar.  Americans weren't allowed to own gold coins for 57 years.  From wikpedia:


Ok, but that's all in a hyperinflation scenario.  Realistically that's not going to happen, at least not in America.  We're actually moving in the towards more moderate inflation, with the Fed raising rates to undermine Trump.

Gab.ai is the tolerant party.  They allow free speech, twitter does not. Leftism is nothing other than a boot stomping on a human face, forever.

Or it could be that they actually need dollars in order to pay rent.  I'm 100% pro bitcoin, but the reality is that in my day-to-day life dollars are more useful for buying goods and services.

No, it won't be the retards.  It will be the semi-smart people who think that they are smarter than we are.  You know the types, academics, media, other marxists, HR ladies, etc...
