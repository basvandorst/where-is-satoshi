Here’s a question: a told a friend of mine who is new to crypto about a low market cap coin a year ago.  He invested .015 in that coin (which at the time was around $200 with the price of btc much higher).
He looked and had basically $5 left of his original investment because said coin had died and btc is much lower.  He’s a little down on his luck, so I offer to give him back his original BTC as a friendly gesture
I reimbursed him .018 and he comes to me saying “why aren’t you giving me the full $200?”
Trying to nicely find a way to say that’s not my issue and he has his original bitcoin now to do with it what he pleases.
Also, I work with him, so I have to see him everyday and want to avoid him being snarky because of this.

I’m debating on using the 1 btc = 1 btc logic with him.  If I give him back .05 btc, he is basically getting .035 rewarded for not watching his own investments.

How do I nicely tell him I’m not giving him .05 btc ($200) now when he only put .015 on the altcoin?  I already sent him the .015 with some interest.

Or or, is this an elaborate catfish to get the community to outpour BTC to "make you whole again".  I smell BS.  The money is just sitting in the new account.  It would have been pushed somewhere else by now.

μBTC is equal to .00001 BTC (or a microcoin)
mBTC is equal to .001 BTC (or a millicoin)
The thought is that with Bitcoins being worth more than $1000, 1 mBTC is worth $1 USD.
I think alot of people are afraid of buying a fraction of a bitcoin, where as 1 mBTC makes more sense to the common person starting off with understanding bitcoins

It is pretty amazing.  I also had a friend that donated a few bitcoins to me as a start for my son's college fund.  He thinks it will eventually fund his first semester of college.

My son is almost 2 years old, so I have some time.  The main goal is to have everything lined up for him when he is older so that he doesn't have to worry about the $185K in student debt he will be having.

That is a pretty sweet ride.  I keep continplating buying a miner to leave at work...

Just keep reinvesting but make sure to take out your initial investment.  That would be my advice.  It's all candy money at that point.

Thank you for the tip.  Every little bit helps along the way when investing in his future.

I just setup an account to take donations on my beer blog site awesome-beers.com.  It should only be a matter of time before someone buys me a beer...

I live in Silicon Valley and have actually had some good conversations with some non tech people.  I know how you feel and have definitely convinced a few to download the app for their phones.
Now to convert my parents that are in their 60s.

That is not a bad idea.  I will work on that this week and let you know the result.

Congrats on joining the party!  I recently started as well by making a wallet for my son's college fund.  He is two now but we figure he'll have about $185K in debt when he graduates, so it's best for us to start saving now.

I am willing to start using it if I had some mBTC to actually distributing or spend.
I currently have 2 bitcoin accounts: one for spending around town and the other for my son's college education.
It's only a matter of time when I can convince my wife that we need to start contributing more to the education fund in bitcoins.
