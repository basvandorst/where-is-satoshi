Apparently people pay more attention to their beliefs rather than their concrete needs

Yes, I will certainly do it ��

after his suggestions I bought. Probably I have to thank him...

That’s true, but education is fundamental too
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:08:42
Well, that’s a great course. Do you know anything about Data Base optimisation? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:49:59
Well I hope so. Both businesses and individuals are suffering because of this.

The truth is that they feel obsolete when looking at the Blockchain

That's true, full stop. The initial aim was different and I still remember that the main motto was "we reduce fees, and we get rid of third parties". Core values changed so fast...

I do not really agree with this. Making generalizations about an entire category is not that fair. We should say that in cases such as the BTC, lecturers are still not prepared and sometimes are misleading the students.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:53:14
It depends from the amount you’re asking for your services. I still accept BTC, but I can understand why you used to.

I did both. 3 Master’s degree whilst working as a business advisor and start my company from the scratch but with the help of my books. Now I have a company with more than 2.3K users. I agree with both theories, working = learning but also learning = opening your mind.
Also, there are 2 ways of studying: monkey studies and intelligent studies... I am sure you’re referring to the first kind ;)

Not surprised. Publishing on Forbes costs less than 5K
