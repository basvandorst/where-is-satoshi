One person's spam is another's legitimate use case. I'm of the opinion that digital cash is a key use case for cryptocurrencies. With real cash, I don't need to worry that it'll cost me more than the value of my transaction just to spend $1. I believe that you shouldn't need to worry about that when spending cryptocurrencies either.
Also you know that Monero's dynamic fee algorithm actually lowers fees when the number of transactions increases? Currently BTC is doing ~350k tx's per day vs Monero's 6-7k. Pretty sure Monero could handle a 50x increase in transaction throughput without prohibitve computational demand on (most) Monero nodes.
Given how fractuous and politicised BTC development has become, I'll personally be amazed if ring-CT ever makes it into BTC core.

Please elaborate on this fundamental unscalability? The dynamic blocksize and recent dramatic reduction in transaction sizes seem like it'd be pretty scalable. Moreso than BTC at least.
Also how'd you come to the conclusion that a vast majority of transfers are to/from an exchange?

[Daily network TX's increased almost 4-fold]( when minko.to (on-chain XMR gambling site) launched in May. Network fees are low enough (&lt; 0.01 USD) that people can actually use XMR for flippant things like gambling with loose change, so I really don't think the Bitcoin comparison is apples-to-apples.
