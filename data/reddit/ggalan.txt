How about sweeping the keys 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:24:31
trying to avoid sending all my coins to a new wallet (with new seed) for each coin split.

i wouldnt have balances on them since all the funds would have been moved to a new wallet after the fork.

Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes"

thank you for the reply,  can you explain a little more detail what you mean by "send a Segwit transaction normally then afterwards import the keys"?

once its immutable the fun is over : (
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:49:26
exactly!  I just had the same issue.

correct, using Limit adds liquidity to the market so its in their best interest.  Its like a casino wanting you to bring as much money onto their establishment.
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:13:28
you should accept litecoin as well, its faster and cheaper.

developers dont seem to want segwit2x

thanks for the link, i meant news on whether bitcoin will fork and create 2 chains not technical information.  it seems the miners in china and core dev are not seeing eye to eye.

GDAX fees are free if you use Limit, Market charges fees.

when it gets busy a bank wire is the fastest, when its not so busy ACH is the cheapest.  I like electrum desktop wallets to store my coins.  If an exchange gets hacked your coins can get lost.

Litecoin works great, an alternative to bitcoin for everyday use.  Bitcoin is better for long term storage.
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:12:50
you can check the mempool here 
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:13:15
Use Bitcoin to hold on to wealth, use Litecoin for transactions.

Definitely faster than ether, I dont use ripple.
