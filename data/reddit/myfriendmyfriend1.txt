I agree with everything you’re saying. All I’m suggesting is that $1 billion is a rounding error in terms of the potential institutional capital that could flow into crypto once it’s seen as legitimate and pension fund CIOs aren’t scared to look like assholes for proposing a small allocation. A buddy of mine works for a university endowment here in the US and said that they would absolutely consider investing once the regulatory environment is satisfactory. The “whales” that are moving markets today are minnows compared to the sort of groups that I expect to eventually dive in once the conditions are right.

You might be right. But the same could be said about any speculative asset, like gold. But gold also largely functions as a store of value. I’m not sure if bitcoin prices can remain elevated long term, but once institutions enter there’s a high probability we’re going to see another parabolic move like in 2017. Like many of the bulls say, over the long run prices will depend on adoption. Demand (and price) should remain high once the bitcoin economy is widespread and strong enough for the masses to want in. It’s the strength and attractiveness of the network that will drive long term adoption. Sorry to quote Warren Buffett here, but he says that price is what you pay and value is what you get. What do you get with bitcoin? I believe the thinking is that long term, you will “get” the ability to participate in a global, decentralized economic ecosystem with a certain level of stability, security, and autonomy that no government can guarantee. Might be a pipe dream, but that seems to be the vision. You can also consider why someone might trade yuan for dollars. Dollars have a price relative to yuan, but the purchaser of those dollars gets something in return, namely the ability to participate in an economy denominated in dollars. The hope with bitcoin is that there will be an entire global economy denominated in bitcoin, which will provide justification for giving up fiat to receive bitcoin.

Stocks also trade on the basis of investor expectations. I don't see any meaningful philosophical difference between the stock market and crypto market. The market price for anything, whether Bitcoin, Apple stock, or actual apples, is an emergent phenomenon representing the market's willingness to give up something of deemed value for something else of deemed value. Value can be based on either subjective or inter-subjective considerations. It's a tired term in this community but NETWORK EFFECTS do matter and will ultimately bring the crypto market to maturity.

Can someone list any alternative uses for the computing infrastructure being built up to support bitcoin? Is bitcoin used within the digital economy of any popular video games? Will a VR network require a substantial amount of computing power? Could bitcoin serve as the currency for our first virtual world, written on top of the blockchain? How likely is it that Facebook will be the first to dominate that world and do they have any bitcoin related projects going on?

I’m not suggesting that a pension fund would ever make a single $1 billion bitcoin purchase. I am just trying to show what a 0.5% portfolio allocation would look like in terms of bitcoin trading volume at today’s prices to put things in perspective. Over the past 30 days volume was slightly under 80k bitcoin across all exchanges. That is ridiculously low compared with what volume/price would do once these big firms start taking real positions. Wall Street largely stood on the sidelines during the last run up. These guys experience FOMO just like everyone else, and will not miss a chance to outperform the S&amp;P once the herd mentality shifts and the next real run up begins. When exactly that happens is largely a function of the adequacy of the regulatory environment that needs to mature to support their participation.

The lack of regulation and rampant manipulation across crypto exchanges is largely what’s preventing entry by institutional investors. Demand will skyrocket once sufficient protections and custody solutions are in place to satisfy these investors’ concerns. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 05:22:33
Whatever you do, use Coinbase Pro, not Coinbase. There are 0% fees on Coinbase Pro if you place limit orders. Coinbase's fees are ridiculous and predatory, taking advantage of the retail investors new to crypto to whom they market their platform. They're going to be hit with a class action lawsuit eventually for their nonsense.

@_date: 2018-09-14 23:39:14
I would think not. The more alternative uses for the existing bitcoin infrastructure the greater the risk that bitcoin could become obsolete more quickly than otherwise.

I’ll admit I’m new to all of this, but I’ve totally thrown myself into it over the past couple months. For years I maintained a completely uninformed opinion of bitcoin based in part on my reading of John Kenneth Galbraith’s “Short History of Financial Euphoria” (which I highly recommend). But after taking the time to learn what this actually IS, I am convinced that this is an absolutely fucking world changing technology. There is a “there” there. This is real. Bitcoin is not tulips. This is the beginning of phase II of the Information Age. At this point I think you either get it or you don’t. All I suggest is invest some time to really understand the technology. If not because you’re investing, do it because it is literally changing everything before our eyes.

I’m inclined to think that if you’re a hodler, these recent price movements do not matter in the slightest given how insanely low trading volumes have been. Once institutions start entering the space en masse we’ll start seeing real price discovery. Look at it this way. The California State Teacher’s Retirement System had approximately $211 billion in assets under management last year. If they or another massive pension fund felt comfortable allocating 0.5% of their portfolio to bitcoin, that’s a $1 BILLION allocation. At $6,300 per bitcoin, that would mean 167,460 bitcoin would have to trade. That’s just one pension fund. It may seem unlikely now, but this is what most of the serious players in this space are working towards.

All very good points, although I don’t believe bitcoin has no fundamental value. Sure, it may be more speculative than other types of investments like a company’s stock or currency trades. But I think you have to ask if there are other reasons why, over the long run, individuals and businesses might want to own bitcoin beyond pure speculative bets on its future market price. I think there’s a case for those alternatives.

Yes. Buy with Coinbase Pro and incur 0% fees with limit orders, and then transfer to a Coinbase cold storage vault where you can store for free. The bitcoin purists will likely disagree, but Coinbase is now an $8 billion company based in US with insurance to protect against hacks. Personally I’m ok trusting them to keep my bitcoin safe for those reasons.

The low volatility is sorta wild. Personally, I'm waiting to see whether demand ticks up once Bakkt launches before I continue accumulating. I'll be pissed if I burn through all my cash purchasing BTC at these prices and then we get a large drop, even though I think that would be short lived. Nevertheless, even at these prices I think the market's offering a fantastic buying opportunity.

How would a large institutional investor buy into this market without causing an instant run up? 
@_date: 2018-10-25 23:33:24
I don't think you could ever really have a bitcoin economy principally because of its deflationary characteristics. Deflation is a lot worse than the low single-digit inflation government central banks try to maintain (so long as they can). Sure, the purchasing power of your money will erode over time under those conditions, but money needs those properties otherwise you would get very little growth in the economy. Just look at Japan. People have a lot less incentive to put their money to work when they can increase their purchasing power by stuffing cash under the mattress.

Bitcoin is the biggest fucking value play of this decade. Why is there $20 on the ground? Because the vast majority of institutions have been prohibited from investing in the space because the industry hasn't matured enough. Until now. This is the biggest fucking no-brainer it's outrageous. I literally couldn't buy more of this shit right now. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 15:43:25
Who else is accumulating heavily? With legitimate institutional infrastructure finally nearing implementation (Bakkt, Fidelity DAS, etc) and prices near the $6k “floor” around which the market appears to have been building consensus, I think risk— i.e., the probability of permanent capital loss — is rather low. The fundamentals appear strong for a large movement to the upside.

I wonder if bitcoin could become the de facto world reserve currency while serving as the primary onramp to the  future global crypto economy. Given bitcoin's clear deflationary properties, I don't see it being used as a primary medium of exchange. The promise of bitcoin is libertarian with hints of anarchy thrown in by some if its more fervent supporters, but government will never cease to exist. Groups of people will always organize and compete against one another to consolidate political power. My guess is that governments will ultimately issue their own cryptocurrencies (with all the inevitable abuse that will come), while the reserve currencies that emerge as such will remain decentralized and help facilitate transactions between nations. Moving fiat around is so incredibly inefficient and expensive right now, which is why I believe there is so much potential for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to add real value in our lives.

The entire asset class is systematically undervalued due to institutional restrictions that are being worked around right now. Big money has been forced to stay on the sidelines, but that's all changing now, especially with the launch of Fidelity Digital. A buddy of mine works for a university endowment here in the states and they're beginning to attend conferences sponsored by the largest accounting and consulting firms like Deloitte priming these investors on crypto, the current regulatory environment, and how to enter the space. The first couple months of 2019 the real buying is going to start.
