yes, but then it's a slow process until we can trade $ &lt;&gt; ALT everywhere.

btc wasn't created for trading off-chain.
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:48:09
why do you think it's not easily spendable? bitcoin mixer will love to make 3% of $60mio, so I think it's easy to obfuscate the btc and cash out slowly.

I googled it for a few minutes: if it's not packed with an old version, it can only be bruteforced - so the implementation is correct. or is there something I didn't find.
@_date: 2016-04-27 02:10:50
this is possible but has a small chance to fail. the block could get orphaned and the transaction is broadcasted so if they do not mine the next block they will lose a lot.
@_date: 2016-04-01 13:50:10
they maybe have full access via api now
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:59:02
thats why you do not do something like predicting a price, especially not as a professor.

is there a link about that? I'm interested in the implementation of the encryption in the zip file.

Is whatsapp open source or why do you think it's secure from government?

don't tell them this. they could change their view about cash and vote for a cash ban if politics push this.

he is rich as fuck after this gigantic pump so what

write them in the chat box. sometimes they had issues, but they always solved them as far as I know
@_date: 2016-03-21 23:51:25
ironically, not everyone represents this view.
@_date: 2016-03-18 21:29:02
the network has to be as big that it cannot have any failure and cannot be attacked, so one computer would definitely be far too little.  
what does it have to do with libertarianism?

You are right, they will run for free. /s

too simple
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:56:39
if one of the dnm's or mixers accept these coins, then the thief just has to send e.g. 1btc to this service, wait a day and withdraw other bitcoins. now someone else has tainted coins from theft.  
  
and if there is no detailed list/tool where you can check that your coins are legal, how does the average user know that he received illegal btc?  
  


  
even if its not illegal, they will get seized first and the person who depoited the btc on an exchange gets a visit from police. that's much stress for a simple btc user.
@_date: 2017-01-27 17:08:52
how does the average user know that he received stolen funds and police will knock on his door the next day, if he sends them to e.g. coinbase exchange?
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:23:09
the title is bullshit and will maybe harm bitcoin more than it helps.  
  
I respect them both for their contributions.
@_date: 2017-01-27 09:20:08
we will sadly discuss till bitcoin dies, if you think that this is no possible solution. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 15:40:26
nobody knows the future. markets can overreact. accumulate slowly with cost averaging, if you are really interested in bitcoin. and never invest more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2016-06-09 14:04:02
war on cash
@_date: 2017-01-29 11:15:36
in addition: copy it to more than one device/cd if you cannot afford it to lose. better safe than sorry.     
@_date: 2016-06-08 18:40:21
so you think no other coin has the right to exist?
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:48:42
@_date: 2016-12-30 05:55:23
as it would make any real difference for most people.

they have deposit and/or withdrawl fees but no trading fees.

you are right that btc cannot scale infinite at the moment (maybe in a few years, but i dont think so). but we could scale if blocks are full and the network is ready. and 2 mb would be possible NOW.
@_date: 2016-02-29 10:08:52
I think it's

why is everybody thinking that thiefs cashout but anybody else here is hodling? I don't get it.
@_date: 2016-05-22 07:28:22
right. but to be fair, it was just one day.
@_date: 2016-05-08 09:35:40
did a few face 2 face trades over mycelium, always waited for 1 conf. never had an issue, but there is a small orphan chance (i think). I would say that 2 conf is mostly secure because it's not very possible that your trading partner has a big mining farm and it's also not worth the effort for a few thousand $.

is there a gpu friendly and cpu unfriendly algorithm which will not lead to asic development?
@_date: 2016-05-09 06:23:54
if you really like to use a brainwallet, google warp wallet. it hashes a few seconds, which is a good thing. more hashing would even be better. but in general humans fuck up at randomness, look at nullc's post to understand why.

I think printing more money can delay it for a long time and also recover economy for a few years, it's interesting to see how long it will last.

afaik a tor member had a fishy delivery route of a keyboard ordered by amazon a few years ago. so nothing new.
@_date: 2016-05-14 01:38:05
so you have to copy paste the raw tx to i.e. an exchange that they know your tx before 6 conf?

IPO for a currency? really?
@_date: 2016-07-11 11:04:21
I don't say anyone has to be a one-coin maximalist but ipo in cryptocurrency space feels really wrong for me. I'm waiting for the day when someone will create eth without ipo.

why didn't he print more than one copy?
