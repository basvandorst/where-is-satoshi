Will do in just a bit, thank you!

Thank you!

Jack Dorsey is a piece of shit.

This is fucking Elon isn’t it? He said he done lost his BTC right? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:45:33
So what lol? I’m not making any wealth off it at this point. It would just be switching to a currency that isn’t used anywhere yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:50:32
Okay cool thank you so much!! Do you know where I could find a comprehensive and more technical guide?

$10K by Thanksgiving

That sounds pretty flimsy tbh, I don’t know if it’s a million dollar idea but I think it could pay off some debt and let me buy more into bitcoin at least. I live in the US, Texas. Idk I’m probably just going to research for another week or so and then start deciding. Thanks for the help! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:03:18
Yeah that would be perfect. Let’s do it fellas, for the homeless and for the Bitcoin. Yep same here, I literally never carry cash and if I saw a BTC sign I would be excited and probably give more than I would otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:46:10
Okay that sounds good, I’ll do that. Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:13:23
Let it DDIIIIIIPPP

What if we started a campaign to help the homeless with bitcoin? I know tons of people would be willing to dish out some BTC for a good cause that also helps spread the word. Set up accounts for them, set up a way for them to use the money etc? Idk sounds cool. Headlines: ‘Thousands lifted out of poverty due to Bitcoin donors’ would be some good press.

If you want to understand how the BTC market itself will act and not like a deep understanding of Blockchain, you could look into some Forex books/Investopedia on Forex. They basically function the same.

I know it doesn’t necessarily lift them out of poverty. Just like chemo doesn’t necessarily get rid of cancer. A lot of them have mental issues and no help, even if they wanted to live a normal life they couldn’t. It’s not always something they can just turn around. In most cases it probably is. All that matters really is that warm &amp; fuzzy feeling though. It’s good for your own mental health to give to charity regardless of what they do with it. You’ve done your part by giving, what happens next is up to God or them or fate, whatever you believe in. I get what you’re saying and mostly agree with that stance even but trying is what matters anyways. Just because it doesn’t always work doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do it altogether.

How fast was user growth prior to this? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:35:57
I’m 99% sure this doesn’t turn out well. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:45:27
Oh gotcha, what would need to be done to solve that? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:38:26
Yeah, fuck it. You can always make more money. You can’t travel back in time to get a better price if it does happen to go to the moon. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:45:40
You don’t understand how it works huh 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:50:13
Well I was intending to profit off it, that’d be cool. But I guess for the BTC community I could live without it. How should I go about that? Just make a post detailing the idea and ask for help/direction? I’d be pretty bummed if someone just went and made it on their own and profited off it instead of contributing lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:54:32
Or buying several BTC at $200 a pop several years back and then managing to lose the fucking information. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:51:12
Yeah lmao I’m safe with my shekels now. I learned my lesson. That’s pretty sweet though I might get that! 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:03:53
I mean I would try, but as soon as I stubbed my toe I’d forget about the bet lol.

Most people technically do live off $8K worldwide tbh. Although not comfortably like in western societies lol. 
‘The average per capita income (excluding South Africa), inflation-adjusted, is $315, lower than it was in 1960. Africa's population is more than twice that of the U.S., but its total income is not much more than Belgium's.’
‘Latin American per capita income. The World Bank released in September the per capita income for worldwide countries. In Latin America, Argentina reports the highest per capita income of 7,600 dollars followed by Uruguay with 5,900. Chile captures the sub continent's third spot with 4,740 followed by Brazil with 4,420.’
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:45:48
I think it’s mostly due to the population boom. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:15:06
Lol wot
