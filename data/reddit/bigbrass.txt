Sometimes I think every time there's a large donation like this, several believers are born.
@_date: 2014-08-31 14:32:33
What effect will this post have on people taking our community seriously?
@_date: 2014-02-11 05:11:01
Dangers and problems aren't the same thing. Dat delusion, eh?
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:09:33
I say keep them locked away somewhere. Never know what might happen :)
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:35:23
I love this sentiment. Care to expand on your thoughts here?
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:44:58
Tell me, what is a revolution?
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:19:58
Cool. That doesn't make me feel nickled &amp; dimed at all!
@_date: 2014-03-11 23:38:59
I don't trust you, so I'm going to extort you for signed proof.
Interesting scenario to think about, actually. . .
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:40:06
143 million days destroyed. . . ?  Oh boy
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:27:50
Thank you for posting this. I found myself nodding along at the start, and double-checking I hadn't drunk-posted this at the end. I agree with almost every point, and I think this neatly sums up the revolution we've been watching unfold. 
Well put!

Your theory falls apart when you account for a human's innate ability to lie. I've even seen it done several times in quick succession!
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:17:22
Solid journalism ol' chap! I hear there might be an opening at Newsweek soon. . .
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:17:09
Aren't we observing the price at an arbitrary moment in time anyway? What makes 'right now' a better choice than 'Sept 2013'?
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:43:26
You deserve so many upvotes
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:40:32
Just don't. You're making every one of us look bad.
@_date: 2014-12-26 03:55:30
What argument?
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:56:29
Don't tease us!
@_date: 2014-03-12 03:15:27
Awesome response, thanks!
This makes a lot of sense. Fills a substantial knowledge gap of mine on the concept. I appreciate it!
@_date: 2014-01-30 23:54:32
God this sub is ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-01-31 03:33:19
Who knows? I'm just saying this community is filled with encouragement and acceptance of the surreal and new. I'm perfectly fine chiming in here and there while watching the community evolve.
Not my intention to come off as baiting. Just casually commenting on how FUCKING COOL it is that someone just sent $50 to some reddit user.
@_date: 2014-01-31 03:39:41
Yup. Government budgets work a lot different than household ones.
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:13:54


So good we pay twice?
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:07:04
Whoa, silly question but how do you get the bookmark itself to show price? does it auto-update or was this manual for the screenshot?
@_date: 2015-04-12 13:29:19
For those that find this question via google, here's the solution:
=INDEX(GoogleFinance("CURRENCY:BTCUSD", "close", A19),2,2)
Where A19 refers to the date in question. Enjoy!
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:29:21
How do I use this to report the closing price for a particular day in the past?
@_date: 2015-09-13 23:25:46
Yeah, you seem to be a busy guy with no time to spend on a project like this. Or, you know, spending 15 minutes in Excel. Cheers.
@_date: 2015-09-13 19:34:36
Dude, you want this done for free but you won't lift a finger to do it manually. Fuck that.
@_date: 2015-11-07 23:07:03
Unsubscribed. Thanks for eroding a decent community.
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:54:41
Man this freaked me out as I use the vault but don't recall writing down an HD Key. Looks like it's an optional setting, and unless you opt-in Coinbase still holds onto the keys.
Or am I missing something and am straight up fucked?
@_date: 2015-10-08 16:09:17
It's almost like the word supply can carry multiple meanings depending on the context. . .
Of course, your condescending approach is the best way to educate fellow enthusiasts on the principles of economics. The basics of which are actually pretty complex.

People tend to discuss large pockets of Bitcoins that haven't been spent for some time.  I wonder if there's a quick way to estimate the number of Bitcoins in circulation?
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:38:56
it's over bud.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:49:02
Doubtful.  I don't believe we've met.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:14:23
@_date: 2013-12-28 03:46:39
Interesting. I hadn't heard of fiatleak, but I see what you mean about how it doesn't differentiate between new and old money being thrown at Bitcoin.
I suppose the difficulty of achieving a more accurate metric for Bitcoin's valuation is why market cap is so accepted. Thanks for posting, very thought provoking!
