Yes, recently sent a large wire transfer and it's over 5 business day and funds are not showing into the account.  I'm getting concerned... escalated a couple of support tickets but have not heard anything from them.  Very non-responsive.  Anyone know a number where I could talk to a human? I tried 1-604-243-7056 but no one picks up and there is a generic message with no option to leave a message.

Beware!!! I'm in a situation where I requested a withdrawal of my funds ($2,500 USD) via wire transfer and their intermediary bank (Silvergate Bank, ABA:322286803) is holding my funds for an unknown reason and it's been over 20 days. I tried to contact the Gemini support via email - initially, they responded with canned answers and now they have completely ignoring me.  I tried to contact the Intermediary Bank and left multiple messages on 18583626300 (bank helpline) and also contacted the Gemini support at 18662405113 but no one is answering. 
Guys be aware of these fraudsters.  It's safer to send your fund funds to Bitfinex in Hong Kong than in the USA.  
Anyone else having the same issue... looks like this is something common as they have dedicated a separate voicemail just for all the wire transfers involved cryptocurrencies. 
Please help raise awareness and help one another to get our hard earned money back from these crooks?

It's been 22 days I withdrew $2500 and I'm still waiting.  According to Gemini the transaction is completed but I never received funds and now they have stopped responding to my tickets.  Any idea what else can be done to get my funds?  This has been the worst experience.
