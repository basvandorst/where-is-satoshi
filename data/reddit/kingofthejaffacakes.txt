Flat since halfway through June.  Big drop from Bitfinex disaster, then flat again.
Variation, but to my eye, around a flat average after June.
Same again, variation but flattened after June, if not May.
And again.
Flat if not dropping after Jan.

No we weren't. We were warned by EXPERTS that Bitcoin's growth would stop. It certainly looks like that prediction is coming true.
Given that previously Bitcoin was growing steadily that is a huge opportunity cost. You have to then ask if the demand for cryptocurrencies has continued to grow, where had that demand gone if not Bitcoin. The worry is... An altcoin or altcoins. Which is a shame because a currency gets pretty much all it's value from network effects.

Pop quiz hot shots...
When customers are faced with their wallet suggesting fees that are a third of the value being transferred, in the multiple dollar range, do they:
 - pay them
 - go looking for an alternative
Economics 101 says that the demand curve falls as price increases. Proponents of a fee market say demand is unaffected or increases.

My point is that whomever is chasing them (and I used "law enforcement" to mean those chasers) only has to be lucky once to catch the hacker.

I just picked the default time range shown by blockchain.info.

Investments are different.  Particularly ones as liquid as Bitcoin.
After you purchase a car; you've instantly taken a drop, since you can't turn it back into the same amount of cash.
After you purchase Bitcoin; you can instantly turn it back into the same amount of cash (modulo trading fees).  Demand then is a function of expected future value.  When the price is rising, then expected future value might be thought of as being higher -- or at least the probability of that higher future value might be thought of as higher.  That increases demand.  It increases until equilibrium forms again: when the market's estimate of the product of probability multiplied by future value equals the current price.

The libertarian in me would prefer they didn't have the power in the first place; so if they insist on having that centralised, authoritarian, ability to affect markets, then having some responsibility go with it doesn't seem unreasonable.

@_date: 2018-01-18 15:22:32
I think it's both:
 - Insider trading is using a position of early knowledge to trade on information that will move the market before the market knows the same information.
 - Market manipulation doesn't require that you personally profit (although you probably would); so "release of deliberate lies by an official in a position to affect a market" is market manipulation.  You might do this simply because you don't like crypto, even if you forgo the opportunity to profit from it.
The official that trades and then manipulates is committing both these "crimes".  The more libertarian you are the less you see the first as a crime, and the more you see the second as simply a weakness of having a system with centralised positions of authority (but would probably accept that it is a crime only because it creates the environment for its own possibility).

That's a good point -- but I suppose equally, why does any government paid law enforcement agency spend effort catching anyone?  Public image is about all they've got -- so I guess it comes down to whether they think they will be seen as doing good.
That being said -- it doesn't have to be government law enforcement doing the chasing.  Bitfinex are probably extremely motivated to find the culprit privately, and have some expertise in Bitcoin to help them.

I'm sorry. You're wrong. Your example is loans of 100,000 for deposits of 110,000... You have the ratio the wrong way a around. Deposits are less than loans, not more. That is the very essence of FRB.  A 10% LTD ratio means deposits would be 10,000 for loans of 100,000. Why would it be called "fractional reserve" if the deposits where larger than the loans? Literally the first line of the Wikipedia article on FRB


You seem to think that loans leave the banking system. They don't.

Supply is the coins available for sale at the moment; not all mined to date (all the coins mined to date don't even still exist; at least some are lost forever in dead hard disks, and forgotten passwords).
The rate of supply increase is the additional coins for sale today.  Miners don't necessarily instantly sell all their mined coins.  They might wish to own some too -- and if they're not for sale, they can't be part of the supply as it is today.

What world do you live in?
Markets react to the power of centralised authorities all the time.

First example of literally thousands.
Today's crypto dip is on the back of an account closures in India. No authority, no announcement, no dip. I have no authority in these markets, so if I made the same announcements there would be no reaction.
Centralised power exists in this world and markets react to it. How can you think otherwise? This is not a question of libertarian principle, not wanting it to exist, this is a question of how the world is.

Daily P&amp;L isn't the whole story though.  They must have made massive capital investment to begin.  They must have massive overheads (i.e. not proportional to bitcoin mined).
Those two things mean that their marginal profit on a single mined bitcoin must already be very large as it has to cover both the marginal costs of mining it, plus contribute toward the payback of the overheads and sunk costs.
If that marginal profit is already greater than 100%, then the halvening doesn't make them unprofitable, it just makes the time-to-profitability longer because the sunk costs are being paid back slower.
Unless they are already businesses in trouble, then I find it hard to see how the halving will mean any of them will switch off.  Especially when you consider that they must already have known about the halving when they took on that capital expenditure.  That means it's already priced in, and it's unlikely they expected to make back all that expenditure before the halving.
The supply of bitcoins is definitely reduced by the halving.  But it's not clear that the daily supply of bitcoins is dominated by newly minted bitcoin -- daily trade volumes are well in excess of the daily miner output -- and we can guess that miners are not selling 100% of their production anyway.  Let's say then that 10% (to pluck a number out of the air) of daily supply were miner produced.  The halving would halve _only_ that 10%; so the halving doesn't half supply, it takes 5% off it.
In short: personally I believe that both the traders and the miners have already priced in the halving.  Which means the actual halving will have very little effect on the day it happens, and subsequent days.  There might be a small rally in the run up, but we might equally have already seen the effects of that.

And you've ignored that even in your description, money has been created from nowhere. Which your original claim didn't allow: you said that the bank could only lend 90% of its deposits. I.e. money want created. The truth is that 90% of loans are created. A very different thing.

Ordinary internet connection is not the same as ordinary people.
You don't seriously think it's bandwidth that means my granny wouldn't run a bitcoin node.
As for trading with you? Why on earth would I trade with you instead of using an exchange? That's just silly posing.. and my not wanting to is because you're a random internet stranger, not because I'm a shill (a word which you don't seem to understand the definition of). And whether I have Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash or anything else is completely beside the point.  Which is that it's not impossible to run a node on typical bandwidth connections. That's it. That's all I said, and I'm right. That you keep moving the goal posts is demonstration that I'm right. It's changed from impossible to impractical to "it's got to be ordinary people"... Whatever.
Now there might be other factors that mean one doesn't want 32MB blocks, or why someone with said bandwidth wouldn't host a Bitcoin node, and I'm not arguing with those. But "impossible" is not the reason.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:29:35
Who said anything about ordinary people? Not everyone will want to. What matters is that they can if they want to. You think ordinary people are running bitcoin nodes now?  And I did say a quarter of my shit bandwidth; it's a smaller percentage on a decent connection obviously.
Since it is only a percentage, that means fresh node syncing is always possible. "not being able to sync" would eventually be a problem regardless of block size. So while it would hit a bigger block chain quicker is a problem regardless.
I don't have any clue what lie you think I told. All I did was multiply some numbers together.
As for "3 hard disks every two years". Seriously? You think that's an expense for running a global financial network do you?  I can buy multiple terabyte disks now for less than a hundred quid. How much will I be able to buy in two years?
Besides, the statement was that it was impossible to do. It isn't impossible. But keep moving the goal posts until you're right.

But if you're going to make statements like "This is impossible", as part of your argument, it had damned well better be "impossible" -- and not only is it not "impossible" its not even impractical (as would be your "crawl to the store" example).  Impractical would be if the requirement was that everyone had the current state of the art.  But it isn't.

The price being high tells me that they _didn't_ sell; they're holding.  Price moves based on supply and demand.  If there was no demand for all the prices before the current price, it wouldn't have reached it's current price.


Why do you assume that many sold at a loss?  Volatility doesn't equal loss -- every seller is matched with a buyer.  The most reasonable assumption is that for every person who lost, someone else gains.  But really that would result in no holders and a zero price.

You don't need to move coins or fiat to perform arbitrage.  Actually moving money for every arbitrage trade would be a very naive way of working.
You just need a float on multiple exchanges.  Then you can literally buy and sell when the prices are right.  You can pretty much rely on them returning to parity soon, so then you undo the trade again when the prices are right.  You make profit on both trades.  Then as your float reduces you can avail yourself of slow Bitcoin and even slower fiat movement to put things back as they were.
The people who do this are almost certainly doing it with bots and making a nice little income from it.  At the same time they are, conveniently for the rest of us, keeping prices balanced over all exchanges.
You don't have to use a bot, and you don't have to be a big player.  For example just a couple of nights ago, the GBP price on coinfloor was thousands below the equivalent USD price on bigger exchanges.  You could make instant profit just by buying on one and selling on the other.  The next day, the difference was gone.

That all time high lasted for a day at most.  You think the majority of Bitcoin owned were bought in that short period?
Price is set by supply and demand; when it goes vertical like that it's because supply dries up because no one is willing to sell such a fast-appreciating asset.  That means very few Bitcoin set the ATH ... which means most owners definitely didn't buy at that price.
As I say: it's not proof, but it's certainly not a ridiculous possibility.

M1 and M2 don't have anything to do with it -- we're talking about FRB -- M0-M3 is all money supply.  From [Wikipedia](


See my other reply to you ... I think you're missing a big part of how money is created by bank loans.  I'll give you the short version though:
 - Bank has zero in the safe.  There is only one bank in this example -- but you can expand this to "the banking system".
 - Alice would like a loan to buy Bob's house for 100,000
 - Bob sells the house to Alice.
 - The bank just alters some numbers in its ledgers.  Alice owes the bank 100,000; the bank owes Bob 100,000.
 - There is now 100,000 extra cash in the economy.  Spendable because everyone trusts the bank's IOU to Bob.
 - Bob spends it on a car by transferring it to Charlie.  But there's only one bank.  So the bank reduces Bob's balance by 100,000 and increases Charlie's balance by 100,000 -- they didn't need to find 100,000 from anywhere -- they've got it by virtue of the loan they made to Alice.
The only spanner in the works is if Charlie wants some cash -- this would be a run.  But luckily the central bank, otherwise known as "the lender of last resort" will temporarily lend banks money/cash in the full knowledge that it'll come back.
 - Bank lends 100,000 in cash from central.
 - Charlie withdraws 100,000 in cash.
 - Spends it with Eve.
 - Eve deposits it back with the bank.
 - Bank repays central.
This allows the infinite creation of money.  So the authorities in their wisdom put a reserve ratio imposition on the bank.  They can't start with 0 in their safe if they want to loan 100,000 to Alice.  They must start with 10% of that (or whatever the fractional reserve ratio is in the particular jurisdiction).

You're correct there are other uses, but they only work if the block chain is secure, and the block chain is only secure if the primary snapshotted element is financial. I.e. Bitcoin tokens are awarded in every block.

"Poor people" is a relative term.  And with Bitcoin, it's not outside the realms of possibility that the guy who talked about Bitcoin when he had $1,000 worth will end up with $100,000,000 worth.  And at that point, everyone he talked to about it knows that.
There's little advantage to telling anyone how much money you've got -- even ignoring Bitcoin.  You might get a brief flash of pleasure because you win the "net worth" game -- but then what?  That information is out there and can never be taken back.

The metaphor of "bubble" doesn't require maths. When bubbles (real ones, made of soap) pop, they're gone.
Any other behaviour than "gone" would make it a ridiculous metaphor and actively confusing instead of enlightening.
So, while it's true that "it depends on the definition", that's true of all words. I personally would rather use them unambiguously with easily understood meanings -- with metaphors that actually apply. And bubbles pop. They don't shrink and grow and shrink... That would be a balloon.  So if the definition is "when I say bubble, I mean balloon" I would reject that definition.
So while English lets me say, "you know Reddit?  It's an orange tiger with a stethoscope; trying to open canned food with harsh language"'; it fails as a helpful metaphor because it doesn't assist the reader in understanding what you are trying to explain.  Similarly misuing "bubble".  If you have to say "Bitcoin is a bubble, only not a real bubble, a bubble of a special type that doesn't behave anything like the bubbles you are already familiar with.  Here, I'll give you a paragraph of definition so you understand how I'm using the word" -- you've kind of missed the point of a metaphor.

The author hasn't completely understood bitcoin.


This isn't the blockchain.
That's a transaction chain.  Bitcoin has those too.  They're not a particularly new invention -- it's just a ledger.  Bitcoin has made a nice cryptographically secure version of it, but it's rooted in standard double entry accounting -- from here, to here.
The block chain is something different.  Bitcoin uses it to freeze the ledger at moments in time so it cannot be edited, but the block chain itself is actually not financial in nature whatsoever -- it's just being used to snapshot financial data.

If pretending bitcoin and the blockchain aren't an inseparable pair; that the blockchain is all shiny and good but bitcoin is dirty and evil is how the media can back out of their stupid "it'll never work" previously held position... good stuff, go to it.
They will inevitably discover that the two really are inseparable, but by then they will have rationalised away the supposed dark side, and we'll be left with what bitcoiners always knew: bitcoin isn't good or bad, what you do with it is what counts (just like with fiat, or in fact, any other tool that humans use).

Correlation is not causation.  But it's easy for pattern recognizing humans to see it as such.
The problem is exacerbated by the fact that trading is a positive feedback loop.  The trade moves the market in the direction of the trade.  In that sense then it's like saying that a rock rolling down a mountain was "caused" by the fly landing on it to imbalance it.  To say that those is to ignore all the forces that put it there in the first place, and the gravity that is doing the actual pulling.  To then go further and assume that anything a fly lands on starts moving at high speed would be ridiculous.
That traders thought Cyprus was going to be a big deal and bet on bitcoin because of it, doesn't mean Cyprus caused the growth.  That was pent up buy pressure, and Cyprus happened to be the fly that landed on the rock (to shamefully mix metaphors).
There was also more than just "Cyprus" at the time.  There was Silk Road going down, BitPay getting huge investment, and a recent block halving.  Who knows which (if any) of them contributed to the price bubble?


Well since the "Greece" event we're talking about is this one, that's irrelevant.  The question is whether this Greek tragedy is about to trigger bitcoin price growth.
Now, I'm obviously not going to persuade you -- and that's fine -- I'm simply arguing that thinking Greece is going to cause the "next big thing" is not really a sure bet.

They make very particular use of Amazon facilities though, and those facilities aren't available at "other sites".
Amazon offer the ability for me to make a wishlist and for you to buy for me from that wishlist, and have it delivered to me.  My details are never revealed to you, only to Amazon, and your payment details are never revealed to me.  Purse.io sticks itself in the middle of that and let's you buy bitcoins from me in the form of Amazon wish list purchases.
It works well.  But it only works well because it's leveraging Amazon.  There is no equivalent at most other online retailers, so Purse.io have limited scope for expansion.  They also have a huge systemic risk from two directions:
 - Amazon could start accepting bitcoins
 - Amazon could shut down their wish list facility

Bitcoin adoption (were it practically possible at this point) would not magically evaporate their debt, would not magically make them more productive, and would not magically create jobs for all the public sector employees who are unaffordable at present.
I'm in favour of Bitcoin because it would impose fiscal responsibility on governments. That doesn't mean it's effect would travel backwards through time and make them responsible in the past.
So, while Bitcoin might help a few Greeks ride out the storm, it would not change the weather in Greece to make there be no storm. Greece has some pain coming and there is no avoiding that.

Most of them likely don't know the difference between bitcoin's blockchain and bitcoin's transaction chain.
They already understand transaction chains because it's just a double-entry ledger with globally unique identities and cryptographic signatures -- very nice, but nothing revolutionary in terms of finance.
The blockchain is used to create irreversible snapshots of that transaction chain in a trustless public environment.  If you aren't in a trustless public environment, it serves very little purpose.
Blocks themselves wouldn't make much sense for a closed interbank settlement scheme, as proof-of-work would be (1) massively less secure than anything a public network (bitcoin) could destroy with one hundred-thousandth of its hashing power (2) a complete waste of energy.
My suspicion is that all the people who are in the shiny new "blockchain research departments" at the big banks find this out very quickly; but when the existence of your job relies on you _not_ finding that out very quickly you keep your mouth shut.

There is no proof that the last price wave was _caused_ by Cyprus.  In fact, as I said, given the subsequent fact that Cyprus has not become a bitcoin hub then whatever adoption there was was not in Cyprus.
Now, you might argue, I suppose, that people around the world saw what was happening in Cyprus and said "well I'm not going to let that happen to me", and that might be so.  But in that case, they have already had that push and it happening again in Greece will do nothing other than confirm what they already knew.
Either way -- Greece defaulting is not going to cause a tripling of Bitcoin price or adoption.

In order for it to replace fiat, it has to become the money of the people who currently hold fiat.  That means Goldman, etc.

In truth I don't think it's actually that when it comes to big banks -- Goldman are the parasitical gatekeepers, they cream money off their clients as their clients money moves.  They've seen the writing on the wall: their clients are going to want Bitcoin, so they're trying to make sure they get a gate to guard so the creaming off the top can continue.  They don't care what the asset is, as long as they're getting a percentage.  If the big boys want to undisintermediate (to coin a word) the disintermediation that Bitcoin has done by getting banks to hold their Bitcoin for them (putting them back at square one), then that is their own stupid lookout -- it doesn't affect the rest of us, which was always the key feature of Bitcoin (and crypto in general) ...

Imagine a jigsaw.  Imagine there's one piece needed to complete it.  If you saw that piece you would instantly know that it was the right piece because it completes the picture.  Now imagine that the one piece you need has been lost in the jigsaw factory.  It's been mixed with a million other pieces.  You must keep trying each of the million pieces until you find the right one.

3  Yes, it would be perfectly possible for one miner to alter the code that they run and have it create reward blocks with 100 bitcoins instead of the current 12.5 (from memory).  However, when that miner sent that block out to the rest of the miners to be the next link in the chain, the other miners (and all the nodes in fact) would reject it under the logic "why should that one miner benefit at our expense, they would be devaluing the whole system for their own benefit and we won't let them".  So -- everybody else keeps that one miner honest simply because they know that if they tried the same, their selfish block would be rejected too.  That rejection is itself a punishment -- the miner has put large amounts of energy into finding that block, and by writing that one selfish number, 100, instead of the acceptable 12.5 -- all that work is wasted.
In the case of a bug fix, or genuinely wanted improvement -- the protocol change is not selfish, it benefits everybody, so everybody accepts it.

Bitcoin and its blockchain are not layers; it's not bitcoin-on-top-of-blockchain.  The relationship is symbiotic.

There's no need; at the moment a bitcoin is divisible into 100,000,000 units (8 decimal places).  That's enough for the forseeable future even if we lost 99 out of a hundred of the current bitcoins.  The value they represent "leaks" into the remaining ones that are circulating (the opposite of fiat inflation when money is printed).
However, let's say all but one bitcoin were lost over time.  A protocol update could add another 20 decimal places worth of storage to the field that says "how many were transferred" in the protocol (transactions and blocks both have a 'version' field early on for exactly these sorts of changes, allowing the existing transactions to be left completely operational).  So still no problem.
In short then: no we don't make more bitcoins, we just divide the ones we have more and more.  Remember 21 million is an entirely arbitrary number -- each one is given a value because of their circulation in the marketplace.

The work is of a particular nature: it has to be hard to find, easy to verify.  Protein folding (or whatever other pet CPU project you have) is not like that.  In order to verify your work I would have to repeat it.
I'd also argue that it's not a waste of energy if it's securing massive numbers of financial transactions.  How much do you think all the banking system computer system spend on energy?  Just because we can easily measure it for Bitcoin doesn't mean every other alternative, that isn't known, is zero cost.

I'm sure there is an old story about a car advert that indulged in _knocking copy_.  I can't find a reference to it, but from memory: a car manufacturer posted an advert describing all the features their competitors car didn't have that they did.  The result wasn't as they'd expected.  Instead people reading the advert thought "I didn't know $COMPETITOR had a model like that" and competitor sales went up.
I suppose it's an early form of the Striesand effect, and I wouldn't underestimate it in this case.  They've basically paid for a big ad that says "we, a large bank, take bitcoin seriously and are scared of it".

Doesn't sound reasonable to me.
We're not talking about the sign up page.  We're talking about the payment page.  If you don't know what a bitcoin is, but you do know what "visa" is, then you'll happily click on "visa".  You won't run screaming from the page never to return.  I think you also need to go and find the nearest 60 year old and apologise to them for assuming they're an idiot.  Every 60 year old I know is competent on the Internet.  They might be scared off by a new site, they'd never heard of, but they aren't going to be turned away from Amazon because it says "bitcoin" in small letters on a payment page.
By your argument, "mastercard", "american express", "paypal", or even "amazon gift points" all would drive sales away on the day you added them to your system.  It doesn't have the ring of truth to me.  In the absence of evidence then, I think I'll assume that the worst that can happen by adding "pay by bitcoin" is zero additional sales.

I'm glad that the thing you didn't say would be 100% correct; but the thing you did say _isn't_; and blaming that on Twitter's word limit is a really odd defense.
Innovation can happen in more than just payment solutions.  ChangeTip is not innovative in the areas you've described, but it is the first company to integrate social networking and tipping.  Why is that not innovative?  And why doesn't it deserve respect?
These sort of innovations are _exactly_ what we want in the world of bitcoin; and having one of the prominent bitcoin developers shout about how they're not doing anything new is hardly encouraging new adoption.  I don't think any of us thought that they were inventing a new internet protocol; just like I don't think Dell have changed their business model because they accept bitcoins.  Doesn't mean I tweet about how Dell adopting bitcoin is no big deal because they could have done the same with PayPal.

I'm afraid I simply don't believe it. Even if papers are published to the reverse.
The simple result of price following hashpower doesn't need complex maths to show it's not true. If it were true then miners would always have a way of increasing price, which they want. Positive feedback would mean that they would keep adding hashpower because why wouldn't they?
That they don't is because it's not true. It simply cannot be. By observation, in fact, in the last six months we've seen hashpower increase and price decrease.
Now... What I do believe is possible is that miners use mining as a way of buying bitcoins, but they do it with electricity. They are holders because they believe price rises will come in future. But that means there is lower supply than there would be, and so price increases. Difficulty doesn't adjust instantaneously, hence there is lag. And miners don't have to behave rationally, so hashpower doesn't have to follow price in the short term.
I accept that there is therefore no arguing with me. I believe these academic papers have manifestly wrong conclusions, and then being papers doesn't automatically make them right. So sorry about that.

Maybe I can persuade you to stop...
Assume bitcoin's binary success probability: either it crashes to nothing, or goes enormously big.
In the first case you are screwed.  If this turns out to be reality, then any more you buy is just lost money.
In the second case, going by the numbers you're talking about, you already have more than enough bitcoins to be staggeringly wealthy if it happens.  Why would you want more?  How much wealth do you actually want?
My advice then: you're already "in".  You've lost two years worth of salary only because bitcoin has had a down year.  If bitcoin fails from now, then no more money helps you bring that back.  If bitcoin succeeds from now, you have sufficient that you'll get your losses plus a nice retirement.
Conclusion: you should stop buying.  You should put what you have in cold storage, pay no more attention to bitcoin and cross your fingers.  Your chips are on the table, the wheel is spinning.  You have no more to do.

That's all inflation is :-)
Every coinbase transaction that rewards the miners is an increase of bitcoin supply; hence everybody's existing bitcoins are worth just a little less.
Demurrage is a (slightly) different thing.  It's a fee charged for simply holding currency (almost like negative interest on your current account).  The difference is that you would have actual units taken off you, whereas inflation simply devalues the units you hold.  I think the idea is to have the incentive-to-spend of inflation without the devaluation-of-the-unit.  (Apols if I've got that wrong -- corrections welcome)

That's not true.  You can't print bitcoin, but you can easily promise bitcoin you don't have.  That's all that's required for fractional reserve.


They fail because unlike banks that run fractional reserve, there is no lender of last resort for bitcoin.  The central banks in the fiat world prevent the disaster that is a bank run by covering them with freshly printed fiat when the bank run happens.  Eventually everyone calms down (in theory) and returns that fiat from under their matress to a bank.  That fiat is then all back in the banking system, and nobody ever knew that all that money didn't really exist a week ago.
Summary: fractional reserve bitcoin is perfectly possible.  Fractional reserve bitcoin that doesn't go bust is not possible -- the first bank run, kills the perpetrator.  Hence we're all very keen on our bitcoin institutions _not_ operating a fractional reserve. (see the recent efforts to do reserve audits of exchanges).

When miners leave, mining for the remainder becomes a little bit less unprofitable (I assume that's what you mean by "impossible").


There is nothing fundamentally special about bitcoin right now (relative to other cryptocurrencies).  The reason it's the most successful is for one reason: the network effect.  Bitcoin's utility is entirely a function of how many places it can be used, i.e. how many other users of bitcoins there are.  A new cryptocurrency user is going to select the one that is most useful: bitcoin.  It therefore gets a little bit more useful.  Therefore a new user selects the most useful: bitcoin.  It then gets a little more useful.  Ad infinitum.
So, the thing that distinguishes bitcoin is that it was the first to the game, and so will always be the biggest and therefore most useful.  To overcome that inherent advantage from the network effect, an altcoin will have to offer some huge technological advantage.  What's more it will have to be an advantage that the bitcoin software can't adopt itself.  None of the current altcoins do that.


All that being said, I can see one advantage that altcoins might be able to offer: that they are smaller.  When bitcoin becomes big enough, it will be utterly impractical to use it for every single world transaction -- microtransactions will just be rejected by miners as being wasteful of their resources.  It's possible then that bitcoin will become the financial backbone, and localised transactions (let's say a per-territory altcoin) will be done on a smaller chain, and cleared to bitcoin on a regular basis when the address balances grow large.
Once you're dealing with multiple liquid cryptocurrencies, exchanging between them just becomes a matter of some clever software (remember fiat banks are what slow down fiat-bitcoins, crypto-to-crypto would be trivial) -- you probably wouldn't even have to care it was going on.
The answer to your question then, IMHO, is "yes" -- some altcoins can become media for bitcoins.  Will it be one of the current set?  No, because we're not in a position of needing them now, and when we do, it will be on a basis other than "lite" != "bit".  For cryptocurrency to succeed, I believe that what we need now is the biggest network effect we can get, in order to overcome the enormous network advantage that fiat has.  Farting around with altcoins now is counter to that.
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:39:27


I really hate phrasing like this.  We "crack down" on crimes; not on free trade.  Also: bitcoin is not "unregulated", it's covered by a great many existing laws.  For example: using bitcoin doesn't mean you are untaxed in the same way that using salt for barter wouldn't mean you were untaxed.
Please stop talking about Bitcoin as if everything anyone does with it is against the law, and pretty soon that time will be over.  It won't because most people using bitcoin are doing perfectly reasonable things.

Economies are made by flow, not by hold time.  That you made the transaction is all that matters.  In fact, in this case you've simply acted as a facilitator for someone who wanted to buy bitcoins through the medium of (probably) Amazon gift cards or who didn't trust or know about circle.

There is more to merchant tools than just the ability to receive though.  How about an API for:
 - Sending receipts to a printer (doesn't actually need the software, that's the POS system's job -- I'd hook a raspberry pi up to a printer)
 - Creating invoices/bills.  In a restaurant, the bill is presented for payment; would be nice if there was API to get the details for a printer too (QR code for example).  There's also the issue of attaching an invoice ID.
 - Refunds.  How is a refund handled?

I'm sorry but: bollocks.
The excessive verification is not necessary for most. When I make a deposit via bank transfer, your bank gets lots of information about my bank account. Specifically the account number. All you need therefore is verification that that account number equals the name I claim. I'd be surprised if that didn't come with the transfer too.
You think my bank gave me am account just on trust? Banks do a lot of verification. When the government come knocking, it will be more than sufficient for you to point them at that bank with an account number.
Whether you are making up these enhanced verification mechanisms or someone in a position of authority is forcing them upon you, they are not necessary and are simply a way to centralise a load of sensitive identity information.
As for fraudulent transfers, that's the source bank's problem. People getting their account hacked and the hacker buying a car doesn't mean car dealerships should be holding a copy of my birth certificate.
Incidentally, I stopped using bitstamp and started using kraken exactly because I'm not willing to give the crown jewels that are my identity documents over to some random internet company on trust that they "treat them like their own". Those are worth tens of thousands to me, far more than the money I can put at risk only temporarily. Carry on like this and I'll move exchange again. I'd also advise you to look at bitstamps market share since they introduced these measures. You'd better be sure that the losses from fraud are going to add up to more than the amount you lose from lost customers.

It's a little bit safer; credit/debit cards are "pull" payment systems -- that is to say the supplier dips his hand into your pocket and takes the money.  You must trust that he takes the correct amount and does it only once.  This is clear when you consider the fact that cards require you to give all the secret information protecting your card to the supplier.  If they choose to store that information, then if they are hacked you can then have money pulled from you by the hacker.
Bitcoin is a "push" system.  You decide to put your hand in your pocket and you put it in the bucket that the supplier is holding.  Should the supplier get hacked and the bitcoin addresses be revealed, the worst that hacker can do is send more money to the supplier, or return your money.
For me, the second seems safer.

I wouldn't say "irrelevant".  It's what gets bitcoin's foot in the door.  For example, the blockchain is really nothing more than a peer-to-peer timestamping system.  These existed before, but never really caught on.  Why?  Because there was no financial incentive.
The first technology to use the blockchain _has_ to be currency; and it _has_ to be given as reward to the miners so that they are incentivised to secure the blockchain for all the other possible application that will subsequently be built upon it.
TLDR; Currency is the foundation; and hence it must have monetary value to bootstrap everything else.

First: remember that it's envisaged that transaction fees will take over from block rewards for miners.  Second: mining is self regulating; the difficulty always adjusts so that one block is produced every ten minutes.  If that is unprofitable for a miner, then they will turn off their system.  That makes mining slightly easier.  An equilibrium is reached and mining will be _just_ profitable, and no more, at all times.


Imagine that there is one miner, and there are an average of 50 BTC of fees available in every block.  That miner is raking money in.  Another miner sees that and switches their machine on.  Difficulty increases to compensate (done automatically by the bitcoin software). Now the first miner is raking it in at half the rate he was, but he's still raking it in.  Lather, rinse, repeat until the point when a single miner joining means that there is no longer universal profit.  The most inefficient miner will switch off.  Lather, rinse, repeat until only the most efficient miners remain making a small profit.
I'm happy to (try to) answer, as best I can any other questions you might have.

Not true.  If everyone earned 20% on their investment (of time or capital), then someone with $1000 of investment does indeed earn more than someone who invests $100 in absolute terms ($200 versus $20).
Relatively though, they are still exactly where they were.
    $1000 / $100 = ($1000 * 1.2) / ($100 * 1.2)

You are offering a counter to the OP who says "it gives them legitimacy" with your comment:

 - You're arguing that "legitimising as a currency" is the same thing -- which is where we came in.
You're basically arguing that the only thing that makes a currency is that the government says it is.

I know you're only teasing but change in value is not the same as interest.  Your bitcoin wallet (barring transactions) does not have a different number of bitcoins in it this year than last year.
Your bank account has a different number of dollars.
Both the dollars and the bitcoins might be worth different amounts over that period (but is something completely different from "interest").  If we're talking about the last year though, that comparison comes out significantly more favourably to bitcoin than dollars.
Now... to go even further, you could quite easily stick your bitcoins on Bitfinex and lend them out to gain interest.

You're right it would not solve their current problem but it would prevent it happening in the future.

Greece being massively in debt would, you're right, not go away if there were large scale use of Bitcoin.

1 bitcoin is 1/21000000 of total.
There are 171000 tonnes of gold or 171000000 kg or 6,031,847,493 oz.
Weight of gold needed to hold same proportion of gold as 1 BTC would be is therefore 6,031,847,493/21000000 oz or 287.230833 oz.
Current gold price is approx 1300 USD per ounce.
Therefore 1 BTC is the equivalent of 373,400.0829 dollars.

It's a huge step from "$800 is a bargain" to "and therefore they're worth $5,000,000 each".
You're in the bitcoin subreddit; you'll get little disagreement with the idea that bitcoin still has a lot of room for growth, but $800 to $5,0000,000 is a 625,000% growth, and would require half of the world's total assets to be liquidated.  It's the scale of your estimate that people are disagreeing with, not the direction of it.


You obviously know that adoption follows an S-curve -- why then aren't you including the back half of the S, when it slows down again, in your analysis?  You can't seriously think that bitcoin will continue to grow at thousands of percent per year?  True exponential growth would use up all world assets within the decade, multiple times over.

I agree your conditions then: $25 (settled in bitcoin) says that the average price of bitcoins in the auction, over all auctions, will be higher than the spot price as determined by, shall we say, bitcoinaverage.com's USD page, at the time of the auction, "Date: Friday, June 27, 2014, from 6:00 AM EDT to 6:00 PM EDT"?  6pm EDT (UTC-0400) would seem to be the "end", so shall that be our price sampling time?

You make not unreasonable points.
I might have to think further about how to run a VAT con with bitcoins.
However, it doesn't change the fact that bitcoin being VATtable wouldn't make it more expensive for merchants to accept, because you can claim VAT back.
As you point out, if I'm VAT registered, it doesn't matter what the payment mechanism is, I still have to pay VAT.  Why would a customer paying in bitcoins make it more expensive for merchants?
An exchange wouldn't have to add 20% when they sell to the future customer, since they _bought_ the coins off one of their other traders, so could claim the VAT back.  The only possible 20% that would be added is on the exchange fees.  Not on the total cost of the bitcoins.

Bitcoin and credit are not mutually exclusive.  Credit existed long before any of the financial systems or companies we have today.
Bitcoin, if anything, facilitates lending.  It makes it possible for the spreading of risk without need of a centralised trusted third party.  For example, rather than go to a bank, what if 1000 borrowers together say "please lend us all $1000, by paying into this P2SH address; we will repay to this other P2SH address".
A thousand lenders then each pay $1000 into that address.  A million in, a million out, only no one individual has all the risk for one other individual.  Rather, each has 1/1000 of the risk in 1000 lenders.
The borrowers pay back to a P2SH address that automatically spreads each payment equally between all the lenders.  Any defaults are shared by all.  No bank necessary.
Those lenders might dedicate part of their investment to hiring a credit check company, or even debt collectors if they see fit; or even a traditional bank to do all that for them.  The point is that it's now _optional_, the service providers no longer have the ability to use their gatekeeper status to force financial transactions to go through them.  They will have to compete on service.
TLDR; credit and banks aren't going anywhere.  Credit has always existed; and banks will be forced to up their game.  No more free lunch.

It will definitely affect bitcoin price.  But indirectly, via arbitrage.  For all intents it's like a Wall Street only exchange.
In truth, the Winkles bought up a load of bitcoins.  Then they wrap them in a "fund".  Probably making one "share" of fund equal to one bitcoin (or some other round number).  When the ETF opens, then those bitcoins are for sale on the existing Wall Street trading systems.
If the price of one share of the COIN ETF triples, then there is an arbitrage opportunity as the coins on bitcoin exchanges would be one third the price.
I'm not sure if there is a mechanism for transferring more of the underlying commodity into/outof an ETF, but if there is then that just makes the arbitrage even more attractive -- if there were huge COIN ETF demand, then you would buy coins at a third of the price outside, and transfer them in for sale inside the ETF.

That's not entirely true.
A regulated ETF opens up access to Bitcoin investment to more traditional organisations.  Pension funds being the obvious one.  While a pension fund _could_ go and buy actual Bitcoin's I doubt they are (a) allowed by law or (b) motivated to make such special effort for one asset class.
In that sense, a Bitcoin ETF adds a feature to Bitcoin: holdable by more conservative organisations.  A holder is a user, and more users makes a currency stronger.
So, while I don't believe that Bitcoin needs it, it's not true to say that they have no connection to any real value.  They add non-zero utility to Bitcoin and so they add non-zero value to Bitcoin.

What you say is true, and it's testament to bitcoin that it would "probable work pretty well"; but bear in mind that there is more to it for bitcoiners than just being able to donate to WikiMedia.  We want bitcoin to be seen as a legitimate method of transferring value, not as some embarassing cousin that requires an intermediary to perform the actual donation.  If bitcoin is seen as "drug dealer wants to donate to wikipedia, but wikipedia is too embarassed" (irrespective of the fact that it would be manifestly untrue), then that could well be actively damaging to bitcoin.
Bear in mind that if bitcoiners had _only_ wanted to donate to Wikimedia, then they could already have been using the intermediary method you propose.  The point is they want to donate _bitcoins_.  For example, there is a great difference between using gyft.com to buy amazon gift cards and amazon accepting bitcoins.  There will have been no "bitcoiner good will boost" such as TigerDirect and Overstock received for Amazon just because Gyft.com exists.
Obviously, anything is a step forward, and a forwarded coinbase account is a beginning.  I just wanted to raise the idea that to really get the good will of the bitcoin community Wikipedia has to be seen to be accepting bitcoins.

Price would be affected:
 - A proportion of the market would have vanished; that would make bitcoin less valuable.  Just as Dell being willing to accept it makes it more valuable.
 - A whole set of trade would no longer be happening.  That reduces the demand for new bitcoins.  Again lowering the price.
If the underlying bitcoin economy was largely based on illicit trade, then Silk Road being taken down should have had some effect on price.  That it didn't tells us that illicit isn't a significant part of the economy.


"minute"  were do you get that from? The reports are that BitPay is doing about a milion a day.  Overstock reports large volumes, and we can only assume coinbase is similar.  The ever increasing bitcoin transaction volumes -- unchanged by SR takedowns -- are also indicative that the white market is the majority of the economy.  Just as it is for fiat.

Libertarians just want government influence out.  "Manipulation" then is just market actors acting.
Some whale short sells Bitcoin and makes the price crash... while I might not like that they can do it, I don't want a law that stops it.  The SEC announcing that ETFs are not allowed causing the price to crash... why?  Who are they to allow or disallow?
The free market means "free of government influence", not "free of price changes".  Any private manipulator had to put money on the line to do the manipulation -- they pay their money, they take their chance.  Government officials get to do it with a press release.
As it happens, in this case, all that has happened is that all those who bought Bitcoin relying on a future approved ETF drove the price up by some amount in the past.  When they find out it's rejected, that part of the Bitcoin price is removed.  That is price discovery working exactly as it should.  Bitcoin is already operating as a free market.  It's the financial services industry in this case who aren't operating in a free market: they want to sell an ETF, people want to buy it -- but both are denied.

Hashing technology was going through a massive changeover simultaneously, from CPU to GPU; so all other things weren't equal.  There's no way to extract the "true" difficulty signal under those conditions.
The big drop of 10-20% is indicative though; since it's the least efficient miners that will drop out first -- so probably the last of the CPU miners.  It's also hard to judge the psychology of miners -- they aren't (and moreso back then) necessarily instantly going to switch off as I said -- it takes them a while to react, and they can also decide to mine unprofitably.
Look at the mining difficulty chart now.  I'm amazed by it -- it's still exponentially increasing, and yet there isn't enough rapid advance of mining technology to explain it.  Miners are obviously finding ways to be more and more efficient on their own.  That can't continue forever though.  If we reach a stable difficulty before the next halving, I'm confident that we'll see an approximate halving of difficulty very soon after.

I'd prefer you spared me the histrionics.


_When_ they enter the market the supply is higher; but then they are moving aren't they?  Hence -- not moving means supply is lower.  What they _could_ do is irrelevant, the only thing that matters is what they _are_ doing.
Non-moving bitcoins are the same as if they'd never existed, until they move (or perhaps more accurately, the same as if they no longer exist once they're stationary).  Let's do a thought experiment:  I store some bitcoins on a hard drive, and put it in a cupboard for 20 years.
For all those 20 years, those bitcoins exist, and so by your theory they _could_ enter the market at any time, and so increase supply.  But wait, in year 20 I find out that actually the hard disk was broken and they were gone from year 1, and could never have been used.  So which is it then?  Were they increasing supply or not?  The answer, of course, is that it doesn't matter -- whether they were lost, or not moving, the rest of the market can't tell the difference, so they were effectively lost for all that time, and so weren't affecting price.
You even recognise that I'm right:


Why would it wreak havoc other than by the fact that holding is different from spending -- which is my contention not yours?  I assume by "havoc" you mean "the price would massively drop"?  In which case, the act of holding is keeping the price up -- by your own argument.


Nonsense.  As I've already shown, holding lowers supply and so pushes price higher.  The higher the price, the more utility bitcoins can be put to, since it's possible to represent more and more valuable exchanges with them.  Eventually, we'd hope that bitcoin will be valuable enough to, say, buy Google or Facebook with them, or fulfill governmental military contracts, or run distributed FOREX (4 trillion a day) -- none of which are possible unless the price per unit is higher.  Hence holders, keeping the price up, are doing a _service_ to bitcoin.
You also shouldn't see holders as a static group.  What's most likely is that as people exercise their time preference, some held coins are spent, and some spent coins become held.  The system reaches an equilibrium were some amount is continuously held and some amount is in motion; but which coins that is at any given moment is irrelevant.


Did I say that no one was using them?  Or that I want that?  Holders need spenders and spenders need holders -- that's what an economy is all about -- my point is that "approximately 70% of all bitcoins have not moved" is not a bad thing in itself.  Neither 100% holding, nor 100% spending is "good" for bitcoin.  In fact, the ability to hold until you are ready to spend encourages you to exercise full, most optimal time preference for your money.  The ability to hold and spend later is vital to allow you to apply your money when it will do you (and hence the economy as a whole) the most good.  The longer that it is possible to hold without losing value (thanks to inflation) the more fine grained you can be with your time preferences -- my preference might be, in fact, to not make use of my money now, but instead make use of it when I am old and not earning; hence needing less support from my family or the state -- why is that not just as valid as your "spend it all NOW" preference?  My not spending them, because I have faith in them retaining their value, means I am willing to tie up the value (in the form of dollars) that I earned in the form of bitcoins, which I don't spend for decades -- since value of currency is based entirely on faith, that is _good_ for bitcoin, not bad.


Lending requires a far more stable valuable over time than bitcoin currently has.  I have no doubt though that those services will appear eventually.  What factor is it that leads to increased stability though?  Higher prices, and hence lower relative volalatility for any given transaction.  And what causes higher prices?  In part: more holders.

It's not as simple as that.
Let's say I am living in Russia as a non-Russian, and have a Russian bank account, and a US bank account.  I've already (because I had to) establish a method of moving money from Russia to US, and I do it in large quantities so that the transfer fee overheads are a smaller percentage.
I'm in a prime position then to be a localbitcoin trader in Russia.  Every time I sell some bitcoins for rubles, I can instantly replace them by purchasing overseas using my US account; and trigger a Russia-&gt;US transfer to convert my rubles to dollars.
That I am set up for more efficient movement of money means I can profit by selling my services to those who are not similarly set up.  Doesn't mean I would keep rubles just because I accept them.
It's exactly the same reason that Purse.IO, Circle, or, in fact, localbitcoins itself works -- people will pay a premium for convenience to someone who will work around inconvenience in exchange for profit.

That's simply supposition.  There has never been a deflationary currency to analyze to be able to talk so confidently (we have deflation before now, but it has always coincided with depressions, which are naturally deflationary anyway as people chase sales).
People might wait longer to buy _some_ things, but that ignores that people have needs and wants that they will want fulfilling.  At an extreme, I would end up dead waiting to get the most for my money -- it's simply not the case that people always value future profit from deflation more than they value the thing that they buy.  It's easy to see that this is true, since it is already possible to get savings accounts that pay _above_ inflation -- that means every bit of money you don't put in that savings account is a loss.  And yet, people still buy.
Also, I know that I can buy a better computer/phone/tv/whatever next year than this year, for the same, if not less money.  Why then does anyone ever buy one of these things?  Answer: because they value the use of the item for a year more than they value the deflationary loss.

Okay, that makes sense.  You'll have to forgive me though, I'm still not quite sure I'm convinced of the security.


The problem is that hashing is not public key cryptography.  While you might not be storing my password, you are storing (or at least are receiving a copy of) my "hash-of-password-to-be-used-for-escrow-key".  So you still have the magic number.
It's your server that is creating the P2SH script, not my browser -- that's essential because you need to add in _your_ secret, which obviously my browser cannot know.  You must be getting a copy of the socalled "seed password" -- and that means you have 2 of 3 tokens at the time of P2SH creation.


Except that isn't true -- the "seed password" is used on two occasions, not one.
 - Creation of the P2SH script
 - Redemption of the P2SH script
For the second of these, I can see that you can do that with no knowledge of my secret, assuming the in-browser work stays in-browser.  But how are you creating that P2SH script in the first place without knowledge of the secret?
It strikes me that there is a further danger: if you are hashing a password in the client and using that as a login password -- it doesn't matter that we can't get back to the password from the hash, since the hash _is_ the password as far as the server is concerned.  Hashed login passwords are only properly secure if the hashing is done server side -- hence the server _always_ sees the "plaintext" password, it's just that the plaintext password in this case is a hash.
Edit: incidentally, I'm happy to be wrong, I'd be delighted.  I'm not trying to be objectionable, I'm trying to understand.

It's got a few uses. It's not particularly more useful than any other element with industrial uses. Gold is about as important as iron.

I think Bitcoin is just as "intrinsicly" valuable as gold.  But the author is wrong here.  Commodity backed currencies are exchangeable back for the commodity.  Gold is a commodity itself so doesn't need "backing".  Bitcoin is also not "backed" in that it is itself the commodity (or perhaps we might say that the bitcoin network creates the commodity).  Bitcoin is certainly not electricity-backed, because you can't turn the mined bitcoins back into the electricity used to create them.  It's gone.
It's the equivalent of saying gold is backed by the effort it took to dig it out of the ground.  Nope.  That effort is gone, it's a sunk cost, and it's not coming back.

You'd have to be, essentially, a card supplier I think.  The equivalent of a bank or credit card company.  They presumably implement a system whereby visa/mastercard can say "hey, I've got a card XXXX of yours and it wants to spend YYYY dollars, is that okay?" and then "card XXXX spent the YYYY dollars I said it might".
Presumably a hosted bitcoin wallet could handle those in the same way.  The difference then is that on the second message, a company like bitpay would trigger a sale of bitcoins for fiat so the currency risk vanishes.  They're already set up for that, so I can well imagine bitpay doing this in the near future.
It would be awesome to have a card with a QR code on it, that I can simply send coins to and then spend anywhere I do with the normal card system.

The "deflationary is bad" boogeyman is based on the observation that every other time the world has had deflation it's been bad.  They confused cause and effect though.  In a recession people drop prices to try and win more business in a falling economy.  That's deflation; but it was deflation as an effect, not deflation as cause.
There has never been a truly deflationary currency in existence.  Even gold was debased by governments of societies that used it as money.  There is therefore no historic basis for the conclusion that a deflationary currency is bad.
Finally: bitcoin is not a deflationary currency.  Barring the negligible amounts that will be lost through deaths, accidents or carelessness, the bitcoin supply is (asymptotically) neutral.  It's therefore neither inflationary or deflationary.  Any subsequent price inflation or deflation in the economy therefore is entirely owing to the economy; not the currency.

I'm gonna need a specific definition of what they mean when these sorts of guys say "investment" and "gambling" and how they're different.  If it's just because "well it's not a stock or a commodity", then that's pretty narrow minded.
The only one I've ever heard that makes any sense is this:
 - Gambling is when the [expected value]( is less than one.  Horse racing, casinos.  The house edge means you don't break even statistically.
 - A bet or wager is when the expected value is equal to one.  The winner pays the loser.  The odds equal the inverse of the reward.
 - Investment is when the expected value is greater than one.  You put money in and expect to get more back over the longer term.  This still isn't a guarantee of course -- businesses go bust.
Now, of course in many cases we don't know the exact odds of success, or the exact reward in the event -- but you make an estimate and if that results in EV &gt; 1 you're investing.
Bitcoin is in no way gambling.  We're talking about potential rewards of at least x10.  We might reasonably estimate the chance of success (success being, that we get that x10) as greater than 10%.  `x10 x 10%` is 1.0 ... so if you agree with those two minimums then you agree that buying Bitcoin is an investment.  Certainly when Bitcoin was a dollar and we were talking about x10,000 potential rises, then any chance of success of more than 0.01% made Bitcoin a reasonable investment, and there are plenty around who made that analysis and were rewarded for it.
If Warren Buffet doesn't agree with those estimates _that's absolutely fine_ -- but he should have to give his numbers, and offer some rational reasons for them before he is taken seriously.  Since he repeatedly says "I don't understand it" -- then I find it hard to see how his numbers can be trusted anyway.

They've already bought the coins.  That'll let them run their ETF as a closed fund.  If it's open, then yes, they'll be able to buy more when they run out on the open market and add them to the fund.  That doesn't change the fact, that they've got more than enough already in the fund to cover plenty of purchases before they have to start restocking.

Exchanges should already be paying VAT on their exchange fees.  That's entirely separate from charging VAT on the sale of the bitcoin that the exchange facilitated.
I can't see it being a huge issue anyway, because if they force the exchange to charge VAT on the sale, they will be perfectly justified then in claiming the VAT back on the purchase.  Since the exchange can only "sell" a bitcoin it has "purchased", then the two balance completely, making it a wash (apart from the exchange fees, which they're paying VAT on anyway).

When it happens, it's going to happen fast I think.
It's for that reason (and the potential $4m per coin prices), that I tell people "whether you believe in it or not, make sure you hold at least one bitcoin as a hedge against it really taking off".  The [expected value]( is so high for any reasonable estimate of probability of success that you'd be insane not to hold just a tiny amount of BTC.  Especially because when this thing goes there won't be any thinking time or "I'll buy in if it looks successful" options.  If you ain't got them the day before, you won't have them the day after.

We don't need encouragement. We need the banks who close accounts at the mere mention of bitcoins to be punished.
So, Mr regulator, go look at bitcoinaverage. Check out the volume of USD trades for bitcoins. The volume of CNY trades for bitcoins. The volume of EUR trades for bitcoin. Then the volume of GBP trades for bitcoins. Then realise that the uk is missing the boat on bitcoin. Our best bitcoin company, blockchain.info, got bought by Americans. This is happening because banks keep during down the accounts of, primarily, bitcoin exchanges.
Well done for "regulating" those banks though. Wouldn't want them abusing their monopoly position would we?

Exactly the same logic would mean that, today, with inflationary currency's no lender would lend.  That they do demonstrates the falsehood of your position.
If the borrowers wages were going down (and remember I said that the rate of deflation had to be stable), then that would be factored in to the interest they are willing to pay for the loan.  That is the only change.
@_date: 2014-04-01 10:30:54
I'm sure you're correct; but there is a flaw in the logic.
Once you get big enough, you are held just as much over a barrel by your supplier as you hold them over a barrel.  Amazon negotiating with VISA over fees can't say "well we'll just stop accepting VISA if you don't give us an extra % off" because VISA will say "you do 100 billion a year through VISA -- you're just going to turn that off?  And go where exactly?".  Monopolies suck.
In that respect, Amazon might be keen to adopt Bitcoin not to get Bitcoin customers but simply as a stick to beat VISA with.

After a period of adjustment (assuming we move from fiat to bitcoin nice and slowly) from 2% inflation to -2% inflation; imagine the situation:
"I should like to buy myself a nice new car.  I think I deserve it, and my current car cannot be relied on to make it through a single journey.  I shall purchase one with bitcoins.  But no, I shall be able to purchase 2% more car next year with the same bitcoins, so I shall instead hoard my bitcoins".
It's obviously nonsense.  Neither deflation nor inflation changes the fact that people have time preferences; bread today when I'm hungry is better than 2% more bread tomorrow.  I will have an electricity bill to pay; I will want to go on holiday; I want to see the latest movie on a Friday night out; I want a pint when I go to the pub -- not next year, but now.


I thought I had explained why the incentives remained the same: `z` (the "over-inflation" profit) can be the same independent of `x` (the rate of inflation).  The interest rate for the deal will change, but the incentive can remain the same.  People will still want the profit, `z`.


I'll try anyway.
Deflation is cast as a bad thing because throughout economic history deflation has always coincided with recessions and depressions.  As it must in a world with an inflationary currency.  We have never had a deflationary (or rather "neutral") currency, and so there is no historic data to say that it will be bad.  Even gold was constantly debased by governments (the Roman Empire might even have collapsed because of their propensity to "water down" the gold.)
We should observe however that in every industry that is deflationary because it outpaces inflation by its advancement (typically computing, and consumer electronics), those industries have not failed, rather they have thrived.  That you can buy an iPhone 6 next year, doesn't seem to stop people buying an iPhone 5 this year.
A deflationary currency would result in the benefit of economic growth being transferred to the people rather than, as we have now, an inflationary currency that transfers the benefit of economic growth to the money printer.  As for the rest of the economy: it makes no difference, incentives all adjust to rebalance whatever the inflation rate -- with the proviso that that rate must be stable enough that those adjustments can keep up.

At present there is a block reward made up of COINBASE + FEES worth of bitcoins, let's call that X.  Miners are willing to spend up to X on mining those coins.  Difficulty adjusts to ensure that the rate of release of blocks is constant (near enough).
When COINBASE is zero, _exactly_ the same analysis is true.  Bitcoin users will be willing to spend Y on transactions.  The number of miners will adjust to compensate for that.  Y not big enough? Miners will switch off until Y _is_ big enough to pay those that remain.
Miners don't get to decide the fees, the market will decide (by, effectively, bids and asks).  Miners _can_ decide which transactions to include in a block -- perhaps some will decide to include only those transactions that earn them money.  Their competitors might be willing to accept less.  Competition will ensure that the fees are kept at their optimum.

Hmmm, I think you're confused.  I'm not looking for a solution.  It's pretty obvious that Amazon, eBay and every other ecommerce site is not being defrauded on every or even any significant number of transactions.
I'm saying that if you are worried about consumers who claim "I never received it", then that is nothing to do with bitcoin.  That problem exists already.  It existed for mail order before the internet.  The fact that those businesses all carried on tells us that it isn't a practical problem.  So why would it suddenly become a problem because bitcoin was involved?

I'm aware English is an evolving language; but the evolution must then surely include my want to keep precision, and be allowed to point out that in fact that phrase didn't originally mean what it's being used to mean?  Why is your consensus better than mine?  My vote counts just as much, just as with bitcoin.  If I lose, I lose, I'm not expecting that one comment on reddit will change the world.  But it might be news to a few people, so I say it anyway.  Don't agree? Fine, ignore me and continue using it how you wish.
The problem with us all just blindly letting words and phrases meanings get blurred is that we then lose the use of them.  While it's all very well that people can now say "begs the question" for their new meaning; what do people who want the original meaning say?  That short form is now edited out of language and we are all the poorer for it.

"Satoshi was an expert in C++".
Really, really not.  The bitcoin client was pretty badly written.  There are still vestiges of that left over today.  (For example: lots of the parameters are hard-coded literals instead of constants; modules where written entirely in the header file instead of organised as separate .cpp files and linked)
"Bitcoin protocol is a masterwork"
Nah.  It's perfectly acceptable, and it got a lot better once some other devs got involved.  What the protocol is doing is a masterpiece of thought, but the protocol itself is a bit clunky.  There are plenty of idiosyncrasies (for example: messages are limited to 2GB, but some of the array length parameters are allowed to be 64-bit numbers; the timestamp is stored as a 64-bit number in seconds rather than microseconds.  That's enough to get us 500 billion years of range) 
Satoshi was a cryptography genius -- definitely.  But from the code, you'd guess not a professional programmer.  You'd guess a talented academic.  That seems to fit with the rest of the evidence.

Microsoft are dying, regardless of how big they are.  If you don't see that you are probably Steve Balmer.
IBM were once the biggest; then faded.  They managed to find themselves new niches.
Microsoft were once the biggest; and are fading (forget about Windows, go count market share of phones/tablets).  They have enough capital to give them time to find some new niche too.
Google/Apple are the biggest; Apple is already fading (again) as the iPhone slowly gets supplanted by Android devices.
I have no doubt that Google will eventually fade too.  It's the circle of life.  And the defense against it isn't "we've got the biggest market cap, so nyah".  It's to anticipate it happening and move the company to take advantage.  MS, to be fair to them, seem to have (finally) recognised that and are searching.

Those non-moving assets have their value set by the assets that are moving though (perhaps counter-intuitively).
In fact, the presence of the non-moving assets is relevant to the price only in as much as they reduce the supply of moving assets involved in trade.

I really like local trader features in mycellium.
What would be fantastic is if it became more symmetric. At the moment you can be a long term bitcoin seller but you can't be a long term bitcoin buyer. Let's say I'm off on holiday, I buy some bitcoins locally, then travel off across the world. I now want to change my bitcoins to my destination currency. To do so with mycelium I have to be become a long term seller and wait for someone to take the offer. Not practical.  What I want is the exact same features I used for buying to be available for selling. A list of people willing to buy bitcoins in my local area.
Mycelium already has all the infrastructure in place to do this, it's just lacking UI.

This is perfectly possible.  I'm not going to do it, because I don't wish to give your dad money.
However, let's say I sent him 0.1 BTC via email. Wouldn't it be worth the effort to collect it?
How about 1 BTC?
How about 10 bitcoins?
How about 100?
At some point the receipient would find a way to collect.  In which case our disagreement is not one of principle, but one of value.  Your Dad, emailed 0.001 BTC wouldn't bother because (presumably) he doesn't have any knowledge of, or desire for a bitcoin wallet (that's why you picked him as your target).  Your Dad, emailed 100 BTC, once he knew what he held, would find out damned quickly how to take that value.
The proposition for corporations is the same.  At some point, the amount of value that they are leaving uncollected because of a refusal to accept bitcoins will be significant enough that it will be worth the effort to collect.
Or maybe it won't.  Bitcoin might just die.  If it doesn't die though, that end point is inevitable: simply by virtue of the self-interest of all parties.

The failure here comes about because mining pools were never properly anticipated and accounted for.  It's not a market failure because the market is too small to be correcting itself.  We don't need 20 mining pools with 200,000 miners each, we needed 2,000,000 individual miners.
If every miner was a full node not pooled, then it would be inconceivable to get one entity with power of 50% of the hashing power.
It's a shame, because there are ways to prevent it; but are now pretty much impossible to implement.  Bitcoin has gone too far down its current path.
Edit: a hard fork could fix it.  My idea would be to require that the block hash not include the hash of the parent block; but of the content of all parent blocks -- all 20G or whatever it's up to now.  We'd be forced back to CPU mining because no ASIC has 20GB of memory.  Difficulty would plummet, but individual miners would be profitable again (in the long term).
How many current miners do you think would "vote" for that hard fork though?

The problem is the dichotomy: bitcoin is the same level of useful whatever the price. Bitcoin is more useful the bigger the "market cap".
So while I would be happy with the price because it would be just as good for me. I would be unhappy because it would mean bitcoin is not being adopted and is not capable of acting as the transaction medium for very large assets.

They're speaking of two different types of trust.
What Sargent says is entirely valid for bitcoin: it requires trust.  Not trust in the protocol, as Satoshi's quote says, the bitcoin protocol functions as well as it does because it is trustless; but trust that tomorrow my bitcoins will be worth the same as they are today; trust that there will be a merchant who will accept them for things I might want; and trust that some fundamental error wasn't made in the cryptography.
For those trusts, only time is necessary.  Trust in bitcoin is already at $900, there's no reason to suppose that more time won't result in more trust.

That your good reasons for rejecting alternative investments are valid, doesn't mean that you should just continue to pump money into bitcoin.  As you've recognised, what will be the difference between filthy and obscenely rich?
If you really can't find alternatives (and I'm not sure you are correct to reject them all, even if they do have potential problems, since bitcoin has potential problems too -- you would be using alternatives to hedge against the world not being as rational as you) then find something to spend that money on.  If you aren't gaining anything further by investing (or even gain the potential of something extra), then use the money.  Do something good for yourself, or someone else.

- Via the phishing site, tells the real user "you need to get in touch with support and tell them to deactivate 2FA"
- Via the real site, pushes the "I have lost my 2FA device" button.
The victim then gets in touch with support and says "please disable my 2FA".  The site does, and says wait two weeks.
Two weeks pass, and 2FA is disabled, leaving the phisher with username and password and 2FA disabled.

Anyone else notice the new narrative?
"BitLicense is developed to protect the consumer from future Mt.Gox-type events" is the tale.
Except if that were so, it would not be placing any burdens on the customer, and would all be on those things that the community is starting to provide itself: proof of security; proof of reserves; multisignature access.
BitLicense is _not_ about protecting the consumer, it's about monitoring the consumer.  Don't forget that.

There you go with the "give" again.  Let's be clear then: no I would not "give" $100 to someone who was going to use it to rape children; I foolishly imagined that that was obvious -- what reasonable person would answer "yes"?  And in what way does anything I've said imply that not only would I give them $100, I would be so enamored with the fungibility of currency that I would give them $200.  Why?  Are you in the habit of giving out money to random strangers?
The reason I mentioned the past was to form an analogy between the situation under discussion: "tainted" bitcoins, effectively; and a similar fiat situation, "tainted" fiat.
Let me go again then with a more contrived example.  Would you consider yourself involved in child pornography if you, a child pornographer, and ten other people put all the money in your wallets into a bowl, and then each took out their original value -- perhaps in different denominations?  Personally, I wouldn't, I wouldn't even ask about what the other people did with their money -- regardless of the fact that there is always a chance that one of the other might be evil.  We all leave with exactly what we arrived with, so I haven't "given" to anyone, I've just swapped one fungible unit of currency for another fungible unit of currency -- for my own reasons, for my own benefit.
What if it was 100 people and one pornographer?  1000?  10000?  Where do you draw your own particular line between the chance of one of your dollars ending up "dirty", and the benefit you perceive from performing the operation (I accept that in the case of money in a bowl, there is no obvious advantage, but there is when we're doing the same with bitcoins)?  If your answer is anything other than "infinity", then you are not arguing principle, and in fact you should be arguing for as many legitimate users as possible to use the service so that the illegitimate users become a percentage that is acceptable to you.

My 0.02 (currency of your choice).
For Bitcoin to go from a market cap of billions to a market cap of tens of billions, then clearly tens of billions have to flow into it.  That's not impossible, but I think it needs more than your small-time investors like most of us.  That means Wall Street.
I can't find chart data from long enough ago to back it up, nor the article I read it in (useless, I know); but when a gold ETF was created, it took a huge price jump, simply because it because easy for Wall Street to trade it using the infrastructure they already had.
My guess is that that will be the trigger for the next price jump for bitcoin.  Wall Street trading it puts it on a par with long-established financial instruments.
Bitcoin's value is determined _almost entirely_ by the network effect (if not entirely).  You can view every previous price jump as the connecting of a large new network to bitcoin's existing network.  Wall Street is the next large network that will connect.
Obviously, as you say, that's _all_ speculation.  There's no guarantee Wall Street will jump on.  But bitcoin's next order-of-magnitude increase has to come from the existing financial world if it's going to come, there is nowhere else that that sort of money can come from.

Arbitrage just wants profit. Any currency is fine, it's still profit when you're arbing. Arbing is a loop, so you just stop when you want output in whatever currency suits you. I don't see that that would necessarily be dollars. Personally, early on in bitcoin I arbed for bitcoins.

You could set them up with a bitpay account; they'll have to pay a small percentage in fees, but it will take all the difficulty out of it for them -- they'll barely have to be aware that bitcoins were involved, it'll be instantly converted and transferred to their bank account.  That also means there will be no currency risk.

If they are owed money and the person refuses to pay, then the courts will order the payment.
This new power is so that they can get the money without a court proceeding.  Essentially it's "owed" them because HMRC calculate that it's owed them.  If you've ever been on the wrong end of one of HMRC's "calculations" you would not be so care free with assuming that it's sufficient that HMRC saying you owe money is the same as actually owing money.
You're right about HMRC not being preferential.  I've been misinformed on that -- withdrawn.  However, if they are given access to raid bank accounts that definitely _is_ preferential status, since no other creditors have that power.

It might also be argued that the improvements are technological as opposed to financial.  Further, wealth is gradually pooling into fewer and fewer hands.

You say that; but the evidence doesn't seem to agree.
If it were all fraudulent cards, then as you say -- there would be no reason to worry about price.  In fact, your concern would be getting as much as you can from the card before the theft is discovered and the card blocked.
With that in mind then, how is it possible that you can wait days for your order to be filled on purse?  Why isn't the order book instantly cleared at all times?  If you were using a stolen card, you would purchase absolutely everything with it at once, get your coins and run, _fast_.
That isn't what's happening.  If you use these services even once, you'll see that.
The biggest annoyance, in fact, is with timewasters who press "purchase", then cancel the order on amazon, which means your purse-order is held in limbo until the dispute is resolved.  There's seems to be no benefit from them doing this, except the vain hope that you'll release the funds without having received the delivery.  I can't imagine many people do that.  Regardless, that _still_ isn't the behaviour of someone committing card fraud.

So?  You've still not justified the 100 trillion.  You've just said bitcoin would be useful at $100 trillion.  Well yes, but it's useful at $10 trillion, $1 trillion and $100 billion too.  Why not any of those numbers as your target?
I don't disagree that bitcoin would be useful at 100 trillion market cap.  What has that got to do with a justification for why bitcoin will have a 100 trillion market cap?
Global assets, that's including all non-liquid assets like factories, land, art, etc, are estimated to be about $200 trillion; so you are saying that you think half of world assets are going to be liquidated from their current form and converted to bitcoin?  You'll forgive me if I think that sounds a tad on the optimistic side.
Bitcoin can certainly be successful, and I'm optimistic too.  But I think it's better to be realistic in estimates like these.  Bitcoin reaching $50,000 would be an absolutely amazing achievement and would put it on a par with other large asset classes; and would likely change the world -- and yet is within the realms of possibility.  $5,000,000 per coin is just made up nonsense.

I certainly wasn't trying to disrespect any of the mobile wallets, and I'm sure you've adhered to the highest possible standards. But no computer system is 100% secure. The fact that it's even possible to jailbreak an iPhone means that there are security holes in it. They're still finding homes in the Linux kernel that have been there for years.  Who knows what else is still lurking, and any malware might one day poke a stick through one of those holes. None of those would be faults in the wallet software, were it even possible for them to be 100% secure.
Better then to not rely on software for your long term stored savings if you want to be really confident. Make a wallet offline on a clean computer, never connected to the internet, say with electrum, but it doesn't really matter. Then turn it into a paper wallet and delete it from the computer. That sheet of paper, I'd argue, at least has an attack surface we can understand and quantify. With software, there is always one more bug.

I don't disagree with your opinion -- I wouldn't pay 20% for bitcoins either.  I only objected to the absolute statement "it's a pretty bad deal for anyone buying btc", since not everyone will have the same criteria for judging purchases.  Similarly, "that doesn't warrant a &gt;20% fee" is not an absolute -- it depends how each buyer personally values the convenience.
That purse.io market their strengths is hardly a surprise.  There aren't many businesses that put out adverts saying "well, our product is a nice colour, but we made it out of really shitty plastic".

I understand there are different meanings.  It seems like your problem is that there are multiple meanings of "accepting" and I didn't state in advance which one I was going to be talking about.
However, since I said repeatedly "... and converts to fiat", I thought it was pretty obvious.
Further, since I was describing the very way in which a "prepaid gift card" (which is a bit of a pejorative term when you consider that it would be a gift card that could be used in a great many places, almost like a currency) becomes a "currency", it seems odd that you felt it necessary to explain to me the difference.

There are no literal physical bitcoins, there is no one unique representation that could be considered "yours".  To care that "yours" are going to a terrorist is like caring that the number 7 can be used by terrorists.  CoinJoin works by combining with other spenders to form a transaction that has outputs=inputs, but output0 is not necessarily equal to input0.  Your complaint then is that in a transaction like 1+2+3+4 = 2+4+3+1 you don't like the fact that "your" 3 might go to a pornographer.
DarkWallet's function is to fix a hole in bitcoin -- a transaction with multiple inputs demonstrate ownership of both input addresses.  Therefore if I can identify the owner of one, I have identified the owner of both.  Then I search the blockchain for use of that now-identified address and do the same again.  That is a huge privacy leak, for everyone, not just terrorists.  Your assumption is that only evil people value privacy.  That is a massive (and I believe incorrect) assumption.
What would your suggestion be for those people who live in countries with repressive regimes (these days that probably includes the USA), who's governments would use such privacy-breaking methods to harm their citizens?  Given that I might want to help people like that hide their activity, would I not be doing a service to humanity by allowing them to mask their legitimate transactions by mixing them with my legitimate transactions using CoinJoin?
I ask again though: do you believe that all users of GnuPG are terrorists (and remember that that accusation was definitely leveled at PGP, the predecessor of GnuPG)?  Here's what Phil Zimmerman said about it:


See that?  "outweighed".  Have you even considered the positives of technology like this, or did you just go straight to "small possibility of bad use equals whole technology should be avoided"?

There is no way any regulator can deal with the sheer size of the financial industry.  It is a band aid, whether their regulations are enforced or not.
Financial institutions have an incentive to fill buildings with people who's job it is to "comply" with the regulations.  What does "comply" mean though?  It means "find a way of doing what they want without it being illegal".
It is the presence of regulators, giving everyone a warm fluffy feeling, that make massive malinvestments happen, because nobody is doing their individual due diligence.  The point of decentralizing everything is that individual failures no longer take down the whole.  _Any_ centralised regulation has to be perfect (and you surely aren't going to claim that) otherwise when it fails, the failure is on a large scale.  Hence my argument that centralised regulation was/is the cause of massive failures like 2008.
Now, obviously you aren't going to see things the same way, your job/career obviously depends on these regulations existing.

The non-collapse in the bitcoin economy after Silk Road 1.0 was shut down points to you being wrong about that.
Everyone assumed bitcoin was all drugs, so the price nose-dived the day of the bust.  Then... rebounded and everything carried on as normal. I don't see any reason why now is any different.  BitPay (who are presumably not laundering money) keep reporting larger and larger merchant turnover; and presumably Coinbase are doing similarly well.
It's assumed that because bitcoin _could_ be used for drugs in ways that bank accounts can't, that it _is_ primarily being used for drugs.  I think you need some solid evidence over and above "gut feelings" given the above.

What you say is nonsense.
Interest rates are almost always set above inflation, just as they would be set above deflation; you have to remember to play fair though: deflation is negative inflation and vice versa.  Your equivalency is wrong, profit above inflation results in borrower paying lender; profit above deflation results in borrower paying lender.  It's perfectly possible in both situations to have the lender not profit by picking a negative interest rate -- but why would you?  In an inflationary world, you can have positive interest, but negative profit, in a deflationary world, you cannot.
No, the correct analysis is that they will charge an interest of `p` on the capital they loan.  `p` will be different depending on whether inflation is positive or negative, but we can be sure that `p` is positive.
Let's calculate a true equivalency... if we take inflation into account, let's call it `x` (positive being inflation, negative being deflation), then over the period of the loan, `n` years, the value of the capital will reduce to
    (1-x)^n
of its original value (measured in the units at the start of the period, obviously the number of units at start and end remains the same, it's their value that changes).  The lender will lend with interest and that will gain them value; giving an overall percentage of:
    P = (1-(x-p))^n
If `p` is greater than `x`, then of course they will have beaten inflation as well, but it is sufficient that they profit over inflation to make lending worthwhile, i.e `p` is greater than zero: always positive, as you'd expect -- the lender never pays the borrower.
Let's then calculate the equivalent interest rates `p` and `q` in the two cases: inflation of 2%, and deflation of 2%:
    P = (1-(0.02-p))^n
      = (1-(-0.02-q))^n
          (1-(0.02-p))^n = (1-(-0.02-q))^n
              1-(0.02-p) = 1-(-0.02-q)
    (0.02-p) - (-0.02-q) = 0
     0.02 - p + 0.02 + q = 0
		                   q = p - 0.04
In other words, a lender in a 2% deflationary world will ask for 4% less than a lender in a 2% inflationary world to make the same profit.
It's possible that the lender in the inflationary world is bonkers and is asking for less than inflation, and hence is losing value - in that unusual case, I will allow that the deflationary lender would have to pay the borrower for equivalence; but that merely highlights how damaging inflation is.

Quite so.
Let's say I am completely bearish on bitcoin.  I am buying them at auction only to sell them for fiat.
Right now, I could sell on bitstamp 15k coins for about 8M -- instantly, completely naively -- that's $533.  Therefore I would, in my completely anti-bitcoin frame of mind, bid anything up to $533 for 15k coins.  We can think of that as a price floor then for the auction -- $533 on the exchange would hardly be the end of the world.
Let's remember though that the auction gives the coins to the highest bidder.  Now let's imagine that I'm a bitcoin bull.  I want 15k coins.  I could buy 15k coins -- right now, instantly, naively -- on bitstamp for about $12M.  That's $800 per coin.  I would therefore be getting a bargain if I paid anything less than that.
Let's say then that the bull is mean and wants a bargain, and bids the current market price, $600 only, for 15k of the coins.  The bear on the other hand bids $400.  Who wins those 15k coins?  It's really unlikely that the bull would bid so meanly though -- he knows that his competitors have done the $800 per coin calculation too.  It's really unlikely that the bear would bid so meanly (not that it matters) -- as he knows his competitors have done the $533 per coin calculation too.
Bitcoin optimists will be winning this auction, not pessimists.  The optimisits will be bidding high, not low.  The only thing that matters then is whether there are more bidders than there are coins.  It seems that that is certainly the case.

Look, no one thinks bitcoin is a global currency. No one thinks its current level of volatility is conducive to usability. But the more adoption the lower the volatility. If that adoption has to occur in such nations were people can afford the occasional drop in value. So be it. That doesn't make bitcoin a long term failure, it just means it needs a long term to bootstrap.

Mining (of a sort) will continue; but with no new coins created.
Your question is odd: how would we lose _all_ coins?  Would everyone become stupidly careless on the same day?  I'll chose to treat your question as being "what if coins are slowly lost over time"?
Since a bitcoin is now divisible to 8 decimal places, and with a software change (which none would object to in this crazy "we lost all our coins" situation) it could be divisible to as many as we like, if even a single bitcoin remained then that could be subdivided sufficiently to run the entire currency just as successfully as 21 million coins would.  Gradual loss then, is simply the economic equivalent of monetary deflation.  As long as it happens slowly enough for an economy to compensate with price adjustments, it's not a problem.
Remember the number 21 million is arbitrary.  The value of those coins adjust to suit the economy.  If there were 10 coins, they would work just as well, each would simply be worth more than when there are 21 million.

You've ignored velocity of money. You can't just divide GDP by 21 million. You must further divide by the number of movements of said money.

Then you haven't truly appreciated the power of programmable money.  You, and a bunch of people you don't know or trust, can get together and make bitcoin transactions that loan money to many people at once.  In other words, exactly what a bank purports do do for you -- spreading the risk of a single default amongst all lenders.


I have -- it goes on with penny shares, not international currencies.  FOREX does 4 trillion dollars a day -- that's a mighty big whale and a might big pump.  The "dump" part of that also comes because the pumped item actually didn't have any value.  That isn't true of international currencies.


That's exactly what it is.  As I mentioned above, bitcoin includes the ability to program the money -- that means you can replace pretty much every financial institution who's one role is to be a trusted third party.

However, over the long life of an open source project many eyes look at every piece of it bit by bit.  No one is actually auditing, but one day a developer (like me, I've done this) is doing a job that requires a bit of a delve into a library or the kernel.  That's the moment that a review happens -- just for that isolated bit, but it happens.

They are not in any particular physical place that they need to be moved.
The only thing you can stop then is the owner moving, not bitcoins, but the passwords to get at those bitcoins that's stored in the owner's head.

It's a good rant, and I completely agree about people going to jail, but fundamentally it's still just "blah, blah, blah, won't someone please regulate us, blah, blah, blah".
No.  Having centralised regulators was the _cause_ of this; they are not the solution.  Just throwing the word "pro-active" around like _that_ was the missing ingredient that would have made it all work out fine is ridiculous.  
Where exactly are we going to find these infallible regulators who have such amazing grasp on the massively complicated interconnected flow of money through the financial system that they can exert just the right amount of regulation that the misdeeds are prevented, but the innovation is protected?  And when we do find them, why aren't they going to have their genius recognised by a financial institution employing them for ten times the salary they would get as a regulator?
I say again, "no".  This is not a problem that can be solved with more of the same, and the sooner we (collectively) stop abdicating responsibility by pleading for some nanny-figure to sort it all out for us and move to the situation bitcoiners are cheerleading for: cutting out the middle men (and removing the necessity for "collectively" doing anything), the sooner all this crap goes away.

I did not assume that.  Again you're missing the point.  I'm saying cosider these two possibilities:
 - A bitcoin is held for twenty years, and then spent
 - A bitcoin is lost in year one.
In year 19.9999999, those two possibilities are _identical_ in their effect on the market -- hence my assertion that a held bitcoin is the same as a lost bitcoin until the held coin is spent.


It is not the tragedy of the commons; we aren't talking about access to some shared public resource, we're talking about individually owned bitcoins.


That is not the tragedy of the commons either.  Self-interested action damaging the many is not tragedy of the commons.  That happens in plenty of economic situations.  And you're right, I don't agree, which is were we started.


Ah, the nub of the matter.  Inflation does not exist to encourage spending, it exists for governments to secretly confiscate from the populace.  And why is "encouraging spending" such a good thing?  Would that be "encourage spending over and above what the individual would otherwise consider prudent"?  That sounds like you want to use inflation to trick people into doing what is good for the many at their own expense.  It's my contention that, in this case, what is good for the one is good for the many.  If everyone is able to act such that their own behaviour is best for themselves, there is no need to artificially steal from them to do good for many.


How do you get that from what I said?  Supply of something is that which is available for sale now -- I am specifically not confusing it with market cap, since it's me that's saying those who hold are adjusting supply.


I do get to set it for myself; and the market tells me whether I am right or wrong.  The market definitely does get to tell me I must sell my services at a lower price than I value them though -- no one would sanely do that, which is how the market comes to a valuation.


Woah!  And you're accusing me of not understanding economics 101?  Price is that which balances supply and demand.  That is why supply is actually "supply at a particular price" and demand is "demand at a particular price".  Supply and demand go up and down depending on price, they are equalised at the price were they cross.  You seem to think supply is "an amount of stuff"; it isn't.  That is why price and supply are intimately related.
I might be willing to sell my bitcoins at $10,000 a coin, but not at $10 a coin.  Many others might be the same -- that means supply is different at different prices.  Hence supply is _that which is for sale_ not that which exists.  Holders (trying desperately to return to the point) are those who are not willing to sell at the current price, and hence supply is lower.  This is the fundamental premise of supply-demand curves.


Of course it lowers supply.  If I don't produce it, supply is lower than it would have been if I had produced it.  Something not existing is the very essence of lower supply.


I "affected total supply"?  How did I possibly do that?  The market has no way of knowing what I have done in my private little bakery; unless the market is psychic it doesn't know anything about supply until the bread is offered for sale.


Given how you've just pulled random Economics 101 words out of thin air -- whether they're related to what I said or not, it seems to me that you didn't understand Economics 101 when you took it.
You haven't offered

People still have wants with a deflationary currency. They just value them correctly instead of being scared into buying stuff they don't need because holding money is automatically loss making.
Price is nothing but a signal to the economy about how to allocate resources. A deflationary currency makes that signal more accurate about what we really need. It doesn't reduce economic activity in the slightest.

You're quite right.  Except you missed out that it is a decentralised gift card, so no one can void it, and anyone can supply you one if they wish.
It's also unusual as gift cards go in the vast diversity of places that will accept this "gift card".
For example: I would happily accept bitcoins for my work, were you to employee me.  I would not accept Walmart gift cards because I don't live in the USA.
With that in mind, it seems churlish to say "it's just a gift card".  There is so much diversity of merchants in fact, that it might be more accurate to classify it as a "currency".

My guess: it's not his arrest particularly, it's that there has been an arrest at all that is scary. Charlie shrem was basicall a bitcoin businessman. That the government would attack in such an overblown fashion and escalate so incredibly quickly (especially relative to, say HSBC and jpm treatments after they were found guilty of massive money laundering) is indicative that the government is completely anti bitcoin and just looking for excuses to attack.
I would imagine that that is what scares the market rather than some arbitrary arrest.

Pretty much any retailer is going to be depositing lots of cash.  And there are certainly "plenty" of them.  Who said anything about "untrackable"?  The deposit comes from a business who is known and the bank just records it.  If the government has a problem, the bank can point them at exactly where it came from, and the business will have to explain the cash deposit.
I'm perfectly aware of money laundering laws.  I'm simply saying that those laws require that the bank know who is depositing, not that the bank deny accounts.
The idea that every bitcoin business is a money launderer is ridiculous -- and that's what banks refusing accounts seem to be suggesting.  Banks, if they were really trying to stop criminals, would allow the account to open then report every transaction to the authorities.  The vast majority of legitimate bitcoin businesses will have no trouble answering AML-style questions.

Bollocks.  Every transaction doesn't have to be _reported_.  Just like you don't have to report every transaction in any other medium you make.  You will have to _record_ every transaction; but luckily the blockchain already does that for the most part.
You do have to report a net capital loss or net capital gain on your tax form, once a year.  Given a list of the bitcoin addresses you own, that number could be trivially calculated from the blockchain data plus the exchange data.  You've got a slight difficulty from any hosted wallets you have, but they will catch up and supply a button to do the same calculation on your behalf.
Whether you choose to report will be your own choice, just like every number you fill in on your tax form is.  You take your chances if you lie.

An increase to $800 would be nice, but not really enough to count as "the next rally", I think.
Previous highs were $30, $260, $1200 -- approximately order of magnitude increases.  We're still post-1200, and 800 would continue to be post 1200.
For me then, the next rally has to be above $10,000.  For that, we would need some serious, serious money to flow in.  That sort of money is not going to come from home/small-time investors as it has done before.  Even another China wouldn't be enough (China's pretty big, and the small timers there only took us to $1200).  That sort of money _is_ going to come from big finance -- Wall Street, London, etc.
Short version then: I think the Winklevoss ETF is going to kick off the next big rally; and that that big rally will be above $10,000.

Thank you for your reply.
I understand completely that you want to try to keep your bank account at all costs.  My point was perhaps to flippantly mande.


What I meant by this is that this is nothing to do with you.  You can't be held responsible for the sending bank's lax security.  That they have managed to have their customer accounts hacked sufficiently that the hackers are able to send money to any destination, and happen to be choosing your bank account, is nothing to do with Bitcoin.  That they are telling you it is speaks more to their wish to paint Bitcoin and its associated services as criminal.
What would be the difference between me breaking into someone's online bank account and sending a transfer to you, or to me sending a transfer to PayPal?  Or to a Yacht company?  Or to a jeweller's?  It's analogous to shutting down the merchant services of Amazon because someone used a stolen credit card on it.  It would be nothing to do with Amazon, and entirely down to the lax security of the credit card system.
While I appreciate your reply, it sounds just like the rest of the finance industry when they are faced with the illogic of their security practices: "we're trying to stop fraud, so anything is justified".
Security theatre is not security.
I accept though, that perhaps I'm judging you to harshly, you suffer the illogicality of the banks just like the rest of us.  I would have more respect for your position though if you didn't set yourselves up as "one of them" by parroting their nonsense.  I'd personally find it more acceptable if you simply said: "we have been forced to do this by our providing banks".
It's a shame that you didn't address my other, more primary point: my government issued identity documents are worth far more to me than any single money transfer.  I simply do not trust you enough to give them over to you permanently.  Even if I trusted you as a company, I would have to trust every employee present and future not to grab a copy.  I don't.  That Kraken has a lower level of verification available and access is the _only_ reason I ended up using you, not because I'm a fraudster, but because I don't wish to have my identity stolen and my life wrecked because of your lax security.  Remember that there is no such thing as absolute security, so there is no way, other than you not having them, that I can trust my identity to you.
I like Kraken, I would like you to succeed.  I believe you've got one of the technically most impressive exchanges, excellent support, and a good attitude.  But that fondness does not remove my own security requirements.  My post was meant in the spirit of helpfulness (despite my slightly ornery presentation) -- if you increase your verification burden, you will not get a more secure exchange, you will get a less successful one, I (and I'm sure many others) will simply move, just as we did from bitstamp (and they were the top exchange at the time).  You need only look at the volume reports... Bitfinex has come from nowhere to be the top-volume exchange.  Why them and not you?  (hopefully that question is rhetorical in the context of this thread).

I've not tried or looked into all of them, however,
 - coinduit.io needs AML/KYC and all that jazz
 - zipzap needs you to pre-register on the website then go find a zipzap terminal.  So still AML/KYC
Perhaps the others are better, and I'll amend my opinion.
Which of those can I register an account with and then faster-payments some money to without having to hand over the crown jewels that are scans of my government-issued IDs?
Edit: Just looked in more detail at coinduit.  It's a bit of a joke really.
The maximum tier is 4 BTC per 18h.  To get to the maximum tier you have to pass through:
 - "1. User registered with verified email address. 0.1BTC"  18 hours 0.1 BTC
 - "2. Full name entered in profile. At least 0.1 BTC bought. 0.3 BTC"
 - "3. Full name and address entered in profile. Proof of identity verified. At least 1 BTC bought. 1BTC".  0.1 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 = 1 BTC = 72 hours
So it's going to take me 72 hours of constant tending.  I'm going to have to buy at whatever the price happens to be in that 72 hours.  I'm going to have to "verify" my identity, which presumably means handing over stuff I don't like handing over.  Sigh.

For me the more interesting question is "why is a bitcoin only worth $650 at the moment"?
The potential is staring us all in the face, and yet the market is still nervous of it enough to leave it completely undervalued.  Big companies have come on board; silk road got killed and bitcoin didn't go with it (demonstrating that all the "it's just for drugs" naysayers were wrong); there has been bad news after bad news from bitcoin _actors_, but bitcoin itself just takes the lickin' and keeps on tickin'.  At this point I'm not sure what evidence adopters would need that bitcoin is going to be huge.  If it's not dead now, it's not going to be dead in the future.  If it's not dead in the future, then it is massively successful.  Anyone selling bitcoins today is, IMHO, insane.

It's a _value added_ tax.  If I buy something for £100, then I can claim £20 of that back.  If I then sell that something for £100 then I must pay 20% of that in VAT.  Hence, since I added zero value, the two cancel and my net bill is zero.
If on the other hand I sold that something for £200, then I would have a bill of £40, and a claim of £20.  Hence I would have a net tax of £20 on the £100 value I added to the sale.

If I had to guess (and I know nothing); it would be that gold did exactly what bitcoin did last year.
Bitcoin's November run up wasn't justified, it was a bubble.  That bubble has slowly deflated over the last year, and we've now found a reasonable level, and normal growth will resume.  If you edited out the last year's graph, then bitcoin has been growing steadily from $100 to $370ish.  Exactly the same, I think, happened with gold -- unjustified growth; the bubble-popping drop therefore hides the fundamental growth that's going on because of money printing.
To put it another way (this is just a way of looking at it that helps me, I'm not saying this is a rule of nature or anything); price of anything will be made up of multiple components:
    p(t) = rational_value(t) + irrational_value(t) + noise(t)
We can only observe `p(t)`, and we'd hope that over the long term `rational_value(t)` dominates; but bubbles and hype can make changes in `irrational_value(t)` completely obscure changes in `rational_value(t)`; and `noise(t)` at any time hides the precise output of the other two anyway.
In essence, I'm saying that because markets are so complicated, we can get counter-intuitive results like "gold continues to drop while printing continues".

It might be marginal, but I still think bitcoin is safer.
Your credit card safety net relies is supplied at the discretion of the card company.  When something goes wrong, I have to hope that I've got enough proof that I didn't misuse my card; that they believe I'm not scamming and that they pay me back promptly.  Those are all risks.
The better option is not to correct things when you're robbed, but to prevent the robbery in the first place.  As bitcoin does.
That's before we even consider the fact that that safety net costs.  In order to restore the money of those who were robbed, your credit card company has to be taking money from everyone over and above their running costs to insure against those losses.  Again: the better option is to not have the losses in the first place.

I think they are wrong; primarily because while a centralised system could be more efficient, a centralised system trying to implement all that a decentralised system would is not.  And that's what we've got.
There is no one bank with one computer holding all transactions for the entire world, and there never will be.  Getting agreement between these various parties is hard, and they've built themselves a huge messy edifice that works well enough that they just keep taking the money and hoping for the best.

Propose a new feature and the response is "there is already a BIP for a better way of doing that". And the better way, while better, is also considerably more complex than the newbies idea.
That's fine. Bitcoin should have best of breed solutions and it isn't something that just anyone should pick up. However that means moaning about not getting new developers while not being particularly friendly to potential new developers is a bit of a silly stance. Guide rather than chastise if you want a bigger team.

      Imperialism \Im*pe"ri*al*ism\, n.
         2. The policy, practice, or advocacy of seeking, or
            acquiescing in, the extension of the control, dominion, or
            empire of a nation, as by the acquirement of new, esp.

            of parts more or less independent of each other for
            operations of war, copyright, internal commerce, etc. The
            practise of building or extending an empire.
            [Webster 1913 Suppl. +PJC]
      
                  The tide of English opinion began to turn about
                  1870, and since then it has run with increasing
                  force in the direction of what is called

If both parties are VAT registered then they can both owe VAT, but can both claim back VAT.  Hence the two cancel.
It's only relevant when one party is VAT registered, and one isn't.  In which case it's treated like any other sale, with the VAT registered party having to pay the 21% that they pay on every other sale.  If the duck-seller is VAT registered, then the chicken has to be worth 21% more in order that the government get their cut.
If that doesn't show you how offensive VAT (and other sales taxes) are, then nothing will.

Another point in favour along the same lines: you can "cash out" your bitcoins when you like based on when you feel the market price is good instead of when you want to buy something.

If we go by your chosen narrow definition of "exchange", then there is, of course, no debate.  You can have whatever you want.
If, on the other hand, we use a more general definition, as for example might be used by people used to "beareau de change", "money changer", or "currency exchange", then the bitcoin ATM's certainly fit [the definition](


Obviously you don't agree -- fine, but "fucking idiotic" is hardly appropriate simply because of differences in definition.
"ATM" just means "automated teller machine", so it's not unreasonable to have that automated teller be acting as a money changer.
If you don't think they are acting as exchanges, then what do you want to call them?

Alternatively, it's possible that the bitcoin community is made up of more than one person and that some of those people worry about A and some worry about B.

I would _love_ it if they tried it.
Ministers that have never run a business don't really understand VAT.  They therefore don't understand that VAT is a double-edged sword.
If you insist that VAT must be added to Bitcoin sales, then VAT can be deducted from Bitcoin purchases.  I could get my business to buy bitcoins with its profit.  That would appear as an expense, so would mean I could claim a reduction in corporation tax on that purchase of 20% (this is risky, as I might have to list them as an asset then, thus not reducing my profit, depending on how HMRC classes them).  It would be a purchase of a VATable item, so I could claim back 20% from HMRC on it.
In short: HMRC would be far better classifying Bitcoin as currency as quick as it can; or we'll all start getting HMRC to buy up to 40% of our bitcoins for us.
@_date: 2014-10-03 12:32:30
The total number of bitcoins in existence is, economically, an entirely arbitrary number.  Had their been twice as many, then the current price would (presumably) be half what it is now.

Property sounds a reasonable category for bitcoin.
It can only have one owner at a time.  Or rather, it can only be in one owner's "box" at a time -- that box is labeled with a bitcoin address, and the key to the box is stored in your wallet.
Capital gains will be due on the difference between the value of the bitcoins when they entered the box, and the value when they leave.  It's therefore pretty easy to calculate your capital gains for your personal wallet (it's a bit harder for hosted wallets, but those services could do the same job for you). Whether you choose to or not, that's your own business, just as you self-report capital gains on your vintage comic book collection at your own discretion.
Make your choice and take your chance; but let's not pretend it's impractical; bitcoin makes it _very_ practical.  So much so, that the public nature of the ledger means that the IRS could actually calculate the tax they are owed using bitcoin days destroyed and the price history (although they wouldn't know who to bill).

The thing is -- bitcoin isn't outlawing central banks, or their currencies.  If they're better and it's true that "it does not automatically mean that a superior alternative is to have money supply set by an algorithm, as in decentralised Virtual Currency schemes", then competition between the currencies will pick the correct winner.
Then there is this bollocks:


Bitcoin has existed for a few years; it's nowhere near mainstream; and no one seriously thinks its market cap is big enough to protect it from volatility right now.  And yet, the central banker is arguing that bitcoin's past volatility is an argument for why it wouldn't work were it the size of current world currencies?  Let's talk again about volatility when bitcoin's market cap equals the M2 of the euro.  Jeez: the FOREX market does 4 trillion in trade a day -- can you imagine how stable bitcoin would be with exchange orderbooks capable of handling 4 _trillion_?

You're absolutely right apart from:


It's not chargebacks at all.  Not even similar.  Chargebacks can be instigated an arbitrary time after the purchase.  A double spend attack has to be timed perfectly, and requires a lot of hashing power to even attempt (and even then success isn't guaranteed).
Square are right to indemnify, as they're perfectly safe -- it's hard to imagine anything other than Yachts and Ferrari's that would be worth the effort.  If it was becoming a problem, Sqaure can defend against it by keeping wide bitcoin network connectivity and observe whether a double spend attack happened -- in which case you would not accept the transaction.  In the case of really expensive items, you can further defend by just waiting until one of the two spends gets confirmed into "The One True Blockchain(tm)"

The _vast_ majority of gold's value is not coming from its scarcity -- there are things that are just as scarce that aren't worth anything.
Gold is valuable because its valuable.  Just like every other currency/money in the world -- it's an entirely circular definition of value (that's all "store of value" and "medium of exchange" need), but that doesn't change that it's still valuable.
Now bitcoin's value comes _entirely_ from its use as a medium of exchange and store of value -- so I'll agree, if you taken them away, gold's value is non-zero and bitcoin's value is zero.

That's absolutely true.  If government declared that it was only accepting bottle tops for payment of taxes, then bottle tops would suddenly be valuable.  That's the most telling part of fiat currency.


"_every_" was the part I obejcted to.  Tax freedom day is about half way through the year, so we can use that to estimate that at most 50% of bitcoins would need converting to fiat.
It's almost a silly thing to say though, the bitcoins that are converted aren't destroyed, they're just sold, and so still exist.  Depending on how fast its moving, one bitcoin could be used to pay all taxes.
Literally a bitcoin only economy isn't possible, you're right; but it's not impossible to have every non-tax transaction in bitcoin (I don't believe it will be, but that's a different point).  I don't think it would be unreasonable to characterise such a situation as a "bitcoin-only economy".

The amount of tax due is not a function of whether HMRC is able to take it from accounts.
Therefore the only reason HMRC want a raid is that they want to be able to take money that they are not owed.  Money that they _are_ owed will eventually become theirs anyway.  Money that they are not owed must eventually be returned to the debtor.
Combined with the fact that HMRC always get preferencial creditor treatment in any bankruptcy proceedings means that there is absolutely no justification for saying that collected taxes will be different because of this offensive attack on private property.
In short: bollocks.

What's really funny is that the purchase of bitcoin is (assuming bitcoin's success) more profitable the earlier you do it. Given that it is the old dinosaurs of the current financial system who are most against it, and will likely be the last to buy in, any success bitcoin eventually has will represent the largest transfer of wealth from rich to poor (although not poorest) the world has ever seen.
The poorest still get an advantage from bitcoin because of its lower friction, but you need assets to benefit financially from bitcoin wealth transfer.

I'm not saying this is what they'll do, but you could fairly easily set yourself up as a lending intermediary.  The deposits would not be demand deposits, they would be "invested" in loans.  100% in, 100% out.  I doubt that would be a problem legally.
This would be more like the model that most people (incorrectly) think the banks currently operate: savers deposit and the bank lends those deposits out to borrowers; paying less interest than they charge and hence make profit on the spread.  That is a perfectly viable business model -- it's just not what banks do now.
I wouldn't be surprised if some clever use of payment scripts made it possible to implement this model entirely peer-to-peer on the blockchain.  Economically though, it will probably have to wait until price volatility is low enough that the two parties aren't risking huge currency losses.

First there is the lead time, how long till it ships? Then there is the time to recover capital. At current block chain difficulty, let's say a year (I think that is optimistic). But current difficulty isn't stable and never has been. It's increasing exponentially. So over that year the return from any miner will drop exponentially. Finally there is the electricity cost to recoup (his electricity won't be free forever), which doesn't change as that exponential decrease is happening.
In short: it's unlikely that he'll make back his capital costs let alone profit. With one proviso: if he keeps what he mines and bitcoin prices go through the roof. But in that case it was just a bitcoin investment not a mining business, and the alternative of just buying bitcoins now would be even more profitable because it comes with no overheads.

I suppose you can look at it like that; but my point is that the IRS will really take (literally) anything of value to settle a tax bill.  So while we might be able to split hairs and say "well eventually they turned the asset into USD", the point is that you had non-dollars and the IRS cleared you bill by taking those non-dollars from you.

I've mentioned it before, this isn't so.  They would be shooting themselves in the foot if they made bitcoin a VATable product.  Why?  Because while you must add VAT to every VATtable item you sell, you can claim back the VAT on every VATtable item you buy.

However you define "money", one of a number of things will be the outcome:
 - Bitcoin isn't, but neither is anything else we call "money"
 - Bitcoin is, and so is everything else we call "money"
 - Bitcoin isn't, but is well on its way to being, and so is everything else.
In this case, it's the latter.  Which is fine.
In short: unless you start being as silly as to define money as "not bitcoin" then your definition will be necessity be narrow enough to exclude things commonly used as money, or broad enough to accidentally include bitcoin (either now or in the future).

You're correct; I'm UK based.  POS transactions here in many non-corporate environments (restaurants, pubs, small shops) are all done over the phone line. Like this:
 - They generally have a separate card machine and enter the amount into that
 - before they give it to you to enter your PIN
 - After the PIN is entered, you hand back the terminal, and it tells its base station to dial up the merchant service modem.
 - After a wait, while the screen just shows "dialling, contacting, blah, blah"
 - Eventually a merchant statement is printed
 - Followed by a customer card receipt
Total time, _at least_ 60 seconds.
I can't speak as to how fast Subway's systems are, nor how fast Bitpay is.  However, using the Blockchain.info wallet on my phone, or electrum wallet on my PC or laptop, I would say I get notification of transfer within 10 seconds, however 3 seconds would not be unusual.  Entering the transaction is easier, beacuse the QR code includes the requested amount, so you just have to push "confirm" on the wallet.
It's certainly true that card transactions can be quicker; but Bitcoin is no laggard in that respect, so I don't really think it's a point of competition between the two technologies.

In what way does "accountability" equate with "refuse bank account"?
The problem is that bitcoin businesses are being refused accounts simply because they reveal to the bank that they intend to do work with bitcoin.
There are plenty of businesses out there that deposit a lot more than 3000 in cash, and they are not refused bank accounts.  The fact that they are a business means they are _more_ accountable, they have to prepare and submit accounts, they have to have registered directors and must submit to audit should the taxman require it.  In short: banks have absolutely no justification for refusing business accounts other than "bitcoin will eventually destroy them".

Therefore the constitution is not clear that only government is able to create currency; only that it is allowed to create coins from precious metals.
To be honest, it's not entirely clear that dollars even count as coinage under the constitution -- which seems to be concerned only with precious metals.  It's also not clear that the constitution wasn't limiting the power of the states, not individuals.
Additionally, saying that only the government can make something that is "legal tender" is not the same as making bitcoin illegal.  "Legal tender" is simply that which _has_ to be accepted, by law, in settlement of debt.  Merchants are welcome to not accept bitcoin in settlement of debt.
Finally; Bitcoin needn't be a currency -- it's perfectly okay classed as a commodity.  In which case it's just an item that is for sale, like anything else.  And it's value is entirely defined by the market.

"Probabilities"?  There are no probabilities here.
TA says "there is a 95% chance of A and a 5% chance of B" but there is no objective way to either come to those percentages, or, after the fact to evaluate them. When B happens the analyst simply says "see how clever I am? I predicted that was a possibility". I'm also being very generous to analysts with that. It's unlikely they would be as bold as 95% confident.
Where is the list of historical predictions and their percentage "probabilities" with success rates to compare against? These trendiness that get broken to indicate breakouts seem to be very fuzzy, when the breakout happens but the tend doesn't change (I.e. price returns to put previous value) suddenly these broken lines aren't hard predictors - that's Texas sharp shooting, changing analysis after the fact.
I don't expect you to put your cock on a block. That's exactly the problem, TA proponents never do. TA makes no real predictions, but uses a lot of words to do so.

Fractional reserve banking is _always_ possible.  It's just that with bitcoin there is no lender of last resort to save the bank when a bank run happens.  That means depositors are _much_, _much_ more motivated to ensure their "bank" isn't using fractional reserve.

Most current accounts "cost", in that they pay less than you could get by depositing that money in a higher paying interest account.  You're paying in the form of lost interest for the facilities the account provides you.
I doubt many current accounts pay even inflation, in which case you're losing money by keeping it there.  The bank is not losing money -- they're putting money to work.  FRB means they're putting ten times the amount you deposit to work, but they still need your deposit to do that.

You've got all the figures wrong. I was using 100 million dishonest, to steal presumably much larger than that (you used 100k in your original, sorry if that change was confusing). If it's sensible for the attacker to invest that much, then it's sensible for the victims to invest that much... All to protect a much larger amount.
I'm arguing that miners don't need to be directly rewarded when the miners are also the owners of the bitcoins being secured by them.
That it isn't happening now isn't important, the block reward is paying enough to keep the dishonest miners out. I was addressing the hypothetical case raised above that when honest miners disappear the dishonest miners will steal everything. As I said though, any investment that is valid for the dishonest is valid for their victims to equal.

I'm aware.  I just recognise that Android's market share is growing faster.
Apple did the same thing with Apple II, Macs, and will do the same with iPhone's.  I'm under no illusions that Apple will ever vanish -- but they have always ended up as only being a fraction of the market in the past.
Also, I'm not sure how you are getting "all while growing market share" as a percentage of the total smartphone market, Apple has dropped massively. 


You do know that dominating the profit share isn't a good thing long term?  Profit is simply an opportunity to be undercut by your competitors.  That Apple are so expensive, I would argue, is what stops them increasing at the same rate as the cheapo suppliers.
But hey, I've got no crystal ball and no particular axe to grind for Android or iPhone.  I foolishly mentioned Apple in a negative way, forgetting that that is sacrilege.  I really wish I hadn't, as I'm sure I'll be destroyed by the mob any minute now.

Fraction reserves are certainly not "fine".  However, nothing stops them being used.
I wasn't precise when I said "policed".  I didn't mean "policed" by the state, I meant policed by the users.  Those services that shouldn't be going anywhere near fractional reserve (like exchanges) and don't prove that they aren't maintaining 100% reserves will be replaced by competitors that _do_ prove their reserves to their users satisfactions.  In that sense, it sounds like we agree.  It is the user's choice.  I personally think those user's would be insane to accept fractional reserve services, but it certainly should be their choice -- with the full knowledge that there is no central bank to bail them out when it all goes pear-shaped.
I'm not sure what you mean about it being monitored using the block chain.  By definition the block chain is 100% reserve.  Anyone doing fractional reserve with bitcoin is doing it off-blockchain.

What use is bitcoin to merchants without consumer adoption?
You can't single out one bit of an economy that's the bit you want; it has to all bootstrap up together.  That's exactly what's happening with bitcoin.
What's more, the bigger a community the more varied the participants, there is no longer any such thing as a "typical bitcoiner".  Some will be young and childish and will enjoy teasing big corporations.  Tough luck, those people exist and will do what they want regardless.  I can't say I personally feel a huge sympathy for WU after they tried to use their corporate muscle to shut down a little guy.  Now they're reaping what they sowed.

Merchants don't need to hold.  Willing to accept is the first stage.
Imagine that every tier  merchant (those that sell directly to consumers) accepts bitcoin, but instantly converts to fiat.
Now imagine time moves on and that a tier  merchant decides to accept bitcoin (i.e. a wholesaler who supplies tier merchants).
If you were a tier  merchant accepting bitcoins, wouldn't you be tempted to keep a few of your incoming bitcoins to buy your stock from your tier  supplier and save yourself the btc-to-fiat conversion fees?
The tier  supplier instantly sells; but now we've got a little economy going in bitcoins.
Lather rinse repeat.
Eventually the core producer does the same; the farmer sell you corn and pork for bitcoin.  The miner sells you ore for bitcoin.  Even if they instantly convert back to fiat, it doesn't matter; a bitcoin economy exists.
The point is that acceptance is all that's needed at this stage.  All we need then is time.  If the article's observation is correct: merchant adoption is outstripping consumer adoption -- that's great, merchant adoption comes with no risk for the merchant, but gives consumers confidence that any bitcoins they buy will have a use.

What I'm saying is that these 30k coins being auctioned are not sensibly viewed as equivalent to a 30k sell wall because that ignores the 30k buy wall represented by the bidders.

Absolutely nothing.
There are no guarantees.  Have you not been told repeatedly "Bitcoin is an experiment, don't invest more than you can afford to lose"?
A great many of us think Bitcoin is going to be huge and will be as big of an effect on society as the Internet has had -- I am certainly an absolute permabull.  However, anyone of those optimists who is treating that opinion as a certainty is a lunatic.
For example, if I thought my opinion held 100% certainty I could happily be running up massive debts now, because I would be sure that next year my bitcoins will pay off those debts.  I'm not.

For "foresight", you (like most of us who are bitcoin propoents) still don't invest enough to destroy you if it goes wrong.  I am as positive as any about bitcoin's future, but that doesn't mean you set the risk dial at 100%.
The only level of foresight that justifies that is clairvoyance.  
There is still no way any of us knows that some absolutely disasterous thing won't happen to bitcoin tomorrow.  Without knowing that, it's not unreasonable for people with an "r/personalfinance" point of view (i.e. optimising your risk/return ratio, not maximising your return) to say that that was not a sensible choice.
Don't take it as a personal slight against bitcoin; it's simple good money management.  That doesn't stop anyone taking a massive risk if they wish -- that's your own choice -- but don't argue it was the best strategy using hindsight, when it was just a gamble that paid off.

JP Morgan doesn't know what "legal tender" is.
Nobody is "compelled" to use legal tender.  You are perfectly entitled to refuse it.  However, if you go to court complaining that a debt hasn't been settled, and the court sees that the debt was settled in legal tender, then the court will consider that sufficient; regardless of whether you wanted it settled in peanut M&amp;Ms or not.
The thing that gives fiat value is that it is useful.  It's particularly useful for paying taxes (which is an area where the word "compel" would be far more appropriate).  Nothing stops bitcoin becoming useful in parallel (or to the detriment of) fiat currencies though, simply because people start using it.

There's a subtle difference, you can still mine away on any chain you want. The majority only wins because their chain grows faster not because any other chain is illegal.
That's the important improvement over democracy. By necessity you can only vote in one government. With open source (and the blockbusting) nothing stops you forking and running all on your own with your own rules. It might not be useful, but that it's possible is what matters.
Edit to add:
For example: I could make a new blockchain, that starts from the current position but I declare there will never be a reward halving.  Nothing stops me.  I can demonstrate my idea, and I can run it completely at my own discretion.  If my idea is good, then others might join me over time.  Consensus here doesn't force the will of the majority onto the minority.
Alternatively, I might decide to drive on the wrong side of the road.  I would very quickly be stopped from doing that (rightly of course).  Consensus here _does_ force the will of the majority onto the minority.
The first option, when it's possible, is the best one to have.  That's why open source is better -- it's the [option to fork]( that's important, not the fork itself.  I think we're mostly in agreement; I disagree only with your statement "opensource is entirely powered by consensus in the first place" -- it's not at all; open source's power is that it doesn't stop the loner from saying "I know better, screw you all" and then demonstrating that he's right (or wrong, but that's not so earth-shattering).

That's taking it too literally.  It's a philosphilcal thought experiment, not a biological question.  Your answer is obviously the correct one biologically.  But then it's a pretty stupid question anyway in that sense because more than just chicken's produce eggs.  Therefore, being that humans aren't stupid, consider that it's probably not being used in the biological sense (in the same way that a great many proverbs are simply idiomatic shorthand for more complex ideas).
So, instead, think of the question as being:
 - Definition: An egg is, exclusively, what a chicken comes out of
 - Definition: A chicken lays eggs as defined by the previous definition
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
The fact that it is a circular definition is what makes this a useful shorthand tool -- for example, when talking about whether merchant adoption or consumer adoption must come first.

Since volatility is proportional to penetration, it is a self-regulating problem. While his volume is small the volatility is large but the risk from that small volume is small. When volume is large the volatility is small and so the risk continues to be small.

The vast majority of taxation is _already_ based on self-reporting.  Income taxes are reported by your employer.  Corporation tax is calculated by the corporation after they work out their gross profit for the year.  Companies collect sales taxes and then hand them onward.
Governments cannot audit even the tiniest percentage of these reports; so they rely to the greatest extent on honesty.
The question then is: why would bitcoin change that in the slightest?  In fact, given that they will almost certainly say "when you pay an employee in bitcoin, you must report the address you paid to", they'll probably find it even easier to track your money than they do now.

The more useful bitcoin is, the higher bitcoin's price. The more users of bitcoin there are (as with any currency) the more useful it is. That, in essence, is the network effect. Implying that the more users there are of bitcoin, the higher its price will become.
I don't think it's actual trades that make it more useful, it's willingness or possibility of trade that matters. If my local bar accepts bitcoins, bitcoins become more useful to me regardless of how many times I go and spend some. Even if zero, just the possibility is sufficient.

When we talk about there being no intrinsic value, that doesn't mean nothing has value.  _Everything_ has value.  What we mean by "no intrinsic value" is that nothing has a _particular_ intrinsic value -- an exact number.  Everything has a value.  What is it though?
Using your example of water.  What is the intrinsic value of water?  A dollar a litre?  Two dollars?  A hundred?  There is no correct answer.  To a man standing in a first world country next to a tap that supplies drinkable water, water's value is fractions of a penny per litre.  To that same man, standing in a dessert after five days of being lost carrying a gold bar, ask him if he will exchange his gold for a litre of water and see that the same quantity of water was worth different amounts at different times and to different people.  Hence, it's value is not intrinsic to the water, it's value is extrinsic and a property of the situation.
By exactly the same example, you can see that gold isn't intrinsically worth a particular amount.  In that desert, it was worth one litre of water.

Your bitcoins are as safe from seizure as your cash is.  Which is, unfortunately, not very.
At least with bitcoin they actually have to beat the password to your wallet out of you, but with cash/bank money they can just take it.  Not that that, in practice, makes much difference -- for comparison see the court cases were people have encrypted data that the court demands they decrypt.  When they refuse, they are simply held in contempt and locked up until they become more reasonable.  In short: your passwords don't protect you from the government.

As weird as it sounds, yeah, they effectively just print it.  You don't see it because it happens spread out over the whole banking system though.
It's easier to see if we take an extremeu case.  Imagine there were just one bank.  Now imagine there is no cash, we use bank accounts for everything (this isn't far from the truth, relatively).
Bob wants to buy a house, and Alice wants to sell a house.  Bob goes down to the bank and say "lend me money so I can buy that house".  The bank says "no problem".  On its balance sheet it writes down
 - $100000 asset -- what we are owed by Bob
 - $100000 liability -- we owe Bob that we are showing as Bob's current account balance, available for widhdrawal
 - Net assets: $0
Bob goes to Alice and buys the house.  He pays by bank transfer.
 - $100000 asset -- what we are owed by Bob
 - $100000 liability -- we owe Alice that we are showing as Alice's current account balance, available for widhdrawal
 - Net assets: $0
No money existed before this started, and yet somehow Alice now has $100000 in her Account.  As time passes, Bob will be charged interest on the outstanding amount, and the bank will make profit on the capital that never existed.
In real life it's more obfuscated, there is more than one bank, and at any time Bank A might owe Bank B or vice versa; the money might vanish from the banking system as cash for a while, only to return when it is spent; but the system as a whole is creating money.  It's a close as makes no difference to "the bank just prints it".

It's a silly thing to even ask for. What function would a central bank be able to perform let alone that bitcoin needs it to perform.
Central banks, for all their big talk are one thing... Being lender of last resort. They are able to perform that function because they can create money out of thin air in the event of a catastrophic bank run (brought on by the fractional reserve system).
Since it is not possible to create bitcoins from thin air they cannot be a lender of last resort. With no lender of last resort, fractional reserve would be a very very bad idea and will be policed for. Hence a bitcoin central bank is a contradiction in terms.
In that sense then it's not like putting training wheels on a space station because that is simply an unnecessary adornment. It's like nailing a dartboard to a swimming pool - just not possible.

Say, 21 million coins are worth X (total).  We lose 1000 coins.  That means (21000000-1000) 20999000 coins are worth X.
 - Old value per coins: X/21000000
 - New value per coin: X/20999000
 - Ratio of new to old: (X/20999000)/(X/21000000) = 21000000/20999000  = 1.0000476

The argument about the current one already being the symbol for Thai-Bhat is an irrelevant one.  Currency symbols are often reused. The dollar symbol, for example, is used for far more than just USD.  The pound symbol was used in Eire for the irish punt until they adopted the euro.

Hmmm. Depends.
If it's simply a holder of fiat and it can be funded with fiat via a bitcoin transfer that's one thing.
What we want though is a bitpay style system where the exchange to fiat happens at the time of purchase not at the time of pre-pay.
I guess this is the first version. Slightly useful, but no more so than just cashing some of my bitcoins out to my current account which has a debit card attached.
The second is such a close match to what bitpay already do that they'd have to be obtuse idiots not to be working on it already (and they aren't).

Guilty.  However, I used to run long-running neural network simulations and used GNUPlot for the output long before matplotlib even existed, so please don't feel that I'm completely against it out of some pre-existing bias (I'm not actually against it).


If they're similar enough that it's no trouble to change, that's even better.
The advantage comes, I think, when you want to do a bit of pre-processing before plotting.  You've got full access to both python's text functions and `numpy`'s linear algebra and matrix manipulation facilities.
So, let's say you wanted to plot, say, the signal anomoly.  It's easy to subtract the mean from your series before plotting.  With GNUPlot, I think (although forgive me if I'm wrong, it's been many years since I used it) you would have to pre-process outside of GNUPlot.
As a more advanced example -- what if you wanted to plot the eigenvectors of your source data?  I'd be really surprised if you could do that in the GNUPlot script.


Hey, well that's all anyone can ask of you.  Perhaps I'll have helped you find a new tool, perhaps I'll have wasted some of your time.  Hopefully the former.  Best of luck.

The network effect applies particularly to the internet -- "hey kids, come and play on my new Supernet, there's no services running on it, but it's technologically superior".  Look how much trouble IPv6 is having getting traction and that was designed to try to keep IPv4 workable during the transition.  It's therefore unlikely the internet will be literally superseded by another.  However, it's highly likely that the internet we known now will be upgraded (as it has been since its inception); possibly by a layer on top of it.

This would be the explanation if the price slowly drifted downwards -- since it would arise from the average of the actions of many participants, without reference to current price.  Price has not been "drifting" though.  It moves in fits and starts.  (it's actually perfectly possible that this is what is creating the long-term downward pressure, but not the big jumps that dominate bitcoin volatility).
The only explanation for sudden downward jumps as we've seen is the random, non-averaged, actions of small numbers of participants, often reacting to price changes which cause more price changes -- i.e. positive feedback.
It's nothing to worry about, but ascribing bitcoin price movements to miners and merchants is simply wrong.

Kodak were digital imaging pioneers, but another part of the company decided that digital was going to destroy their film sales, so didn't push it.

You're being unfair.  The idea of a chain of hashes wasn't new.  Jeez, I accidentally did it years ago for storing history of uploaded assets to a website.  And git does a similar thing.
It takes a leap though to try to brute force the hashes as the proof of work system.  Then another leap to make it decentralised and trustless by having miners compete for a fixed reward.  When we say "the blockchain is what was clever" we're not talking about the idea of a chain of blocks; we're talking about the blockchain as it is in bitcoin -- self regulating, decentralised and trustless.
Even if you accept that it was merely the synthesis of other ideas; _that_ is still an enormous achievement.  Even more so if you're saying "well all this stuff had been available for years" -- if it was so obvious, why had no one else done it?

Thanks for your continued indulgence.


I understand you only need public keys on the server side to create the P2SH.  But a hash is not a key -- public/private keys are a pair.
Are you saying the password in the client-side is scrypt-hashed and that is used as a private key, from which you generate a public key, which is in turn sent to the server?  So you've implemented public key cryptography in the client-side JavaScript?


I understand that -- I'm certainly not questioning the infeasability of undoing a hash.  At first it sounded like you has the scrypt-hash on the server side and were generating the key pair there.  If you're not, then my objections go away.


Ah okay; that's much better.


Happy to oblige ;-)
Can I make an additional suggestion for your site then, with the above in mind?  You shouldn't just show the P2SH hash -- you need to show the script, and make it possible for us to check the script's hash that we're sending to.  Otherwise there is nothing to stop you from making any script you like (obviously I'm not saying you're not trustworthy, I just like systems to not rely on trustworthiness) -- a script which isn't necessarily the 2-of-3 script we think it is.
Additionally: you should do as blockchain do and open source your cryptographic key management code so that that can be verified -- possibly with a browser extension.  Remember that JavaScript is inherently impossible to secure 100%, since another script can always undo the work of a previous one.

Stolen != Lost.  (Oh and grammatically they mean "numbers" not "amounts", bitcoins are countable)
Stolen coins stay in circulation (modulo tainting coins at the risk of breaking fungibility), and the remaining coins are therefore unaffected.
Lost coins (deleted private keys) do not stay in circulation and so increase the value of the remaining coins.


What?  Based on the idea that some coins will be lost?  
At current market cap of about 4 billion to get a million dollar coin would mean having 4000 coins total.  i.e. collectively we'd have to lose approximately 12 million coins.   The premise of the article is utter nonsense.  People are not going to be so casual with such a valuable commodity.

The illegal organisations _do not follow the law anyway_; they will happily accept donations without your personal details -- so how does requiring that the _legal_ organisations take your personal details prevent the illegals being funded?  It doesn't because these laws are not there to prevent ISIS et al being funded anonymously -- those laws are to stop the _legal_ companies from laundering money, not the illegals -- who don't care if they're caught laundering money, as they're already illegal to start with.

Your logic is wrong. 


With a deflationary currency, what you are paid back is worth more.


If that is so, then why do lenders lend today knowing that the debt only gets easier for the lender to pay back over time?
The answers to all these questions are easy: "why?" "profit".
The lender will lend X and will get back X+P; with a deflationary currency, the X he gets back is worth more, but it's the same amount.  Therefore his incentive to lend is that he also gains P over and above what he would have had without lending.
The borrower lends X and pays back X+P. If the borrower can put X to use such that it earns him more than P then he has profited.  If he values the use of X now over the value of P in the future, then he also profits by borrowing.  The classic example being the purchase of a house with borrowed money means that you value the use of the house for the period of the loan more than you value the interest you have to pay on the loan.
In both cases, the logic is the same regardless of whether the currency is inflationary or deflationary.  In both cases, both parties expect to profit.  The only thing that can change is that the perceived value for each party is different, so the interest rates will be different.  You might decided that it is more profitable to rent than to buy somewhere to live.  In the case of housing though, that would naturally result in a reduced demand for houses to purchase, and we'd therefore expect the price of housing to reduce to compensate.  Again: inflation or deflation is irrelevant in this analysis.
The only proviso for this logic to work is that the rate of inflation or deflation moves slowly enough for the market to make these revaluations and compensations.  But that is true regardless of inflation/deflation.

No.  The halving is known to be going to happen so will be priced in in advance.  Just as it was last time.  Look at the price charts for when it happened -- price didn't move any more than any other day.


You keep saying that; but you don't offer any source for where you're getting your numbers from.  You're just making them up.  $5m based on what?  Wealth isn't just going to appear, it's got to come from somewhere -- tell me where you think this $100 trillion of wealth is going to come from?  Which other asset is going to decrease in value, in order that bitcoin increases?  $100 trillion is one hell of a decrease in whatever asset you're picking.


I'm not worried specifically about $5m exactly.  It's order of magnitude that matters.  $1m, $5m or $9m -- I'd have the same concern.  You don't seem to have got $5m from anywhere.
For bitcoin to be worth $5m per coin, someone has to be willing to pay that for them.  Why will they do that?  Demand will have to be high, which means someone will be willing to sell $5m worth of another asset in exchange for one bitcoin -- which asset do you think they are going to sell?  Which asset is going to be so much not in demand that the price of bitcoin will shoot so high?
Perhaps you're measuring your price in 2024 dollars.  But given that we don't know what they're going to be worth in 2014 dollars, your $5m would then been even more meaningless.

Could you stop with the ad hominem?


You've missed the point -- the point is that the market can't tell if the egg is broken or not; and behaves the same way for those twenty years until it is put to use (or not in the case of the broken egg).


The act of holding is one of NOT spending.  And as you seem happy with the idea that spending alters things, then so too, by definition does not spending.


Everyone does _not_ do that though.  And as I explicitly said -- that wasn't what I was advocating.


Lending would indeed be an additional facility; I'm certainly not against it.  But holding is not a crime and those who are holding bitcoin are doing the rest of the economy a service just as much as those who are spending.  The service was done at the time they bought, when they took value they had earned and converted it to bitcoins.


What on earth do you think "supply" means?  You do understand that supply is a fluid thing, when we talk about supply and demand it is "supply at a particular price".  I might be willing to sell my services at $100 an hour but not at $10 an hour -- hence, when I withhold my services at $10 an hour, the total supply of that service in the economy at that time is lowered.


Until you offer it up for use it _absolutely_ does lower supply.
If I am a baker, and I choose not to bake some loaves does that not lower supply?
If I am a baker and I choose to bake those loaves, but then throw them away, how is that any different from my not having baked them at all?  Supply is lowered.
If I am a baker, and my (hypothetical) bread is good for 20 years, and I choose not to sell them on day one, how is that different from my not having baked them?  The loaves existence is not what increases supply, it is the offering them for sale that increases supply.
Just as it is not the existence of the bitcoins that increases supply; it is the offering them for sale ("sale" in the case of currency being "spend").


You continue with the histrionics, and add in ad hominem attacks.  I really don't think they help your argument.

I'm honestly surprised the difficulty growth has gone on as long as it has.  Eventually though the hashing technology will be the most that can be wrung out of current computing technology, then difficulty will just grow with Moore's Law (as long as that holds, which it won't).

Who cares?
Legal tender is a minor issue and is only to protect debtors against unreasonable demands from lenders.
Nothing stops a lender accepting bitcoin to extinguish a debt. Just like nothing stops a shopkeeper from accepting it in exchange for a coffee.
In fact a legal tender law for bitcoin wouldn't be in keeping with bitcoin's ethos. Creditors would be forced to accept bitcoin. Not necessary.

I've looked at some of the others.  Looks like I need to update my knowledge, there's some potential there to suit me.
I don't mind so much being asked for ID, as I'm not committing crimes.  What concerns me is the exchanges that want high-resolution scans of multiple government IDs, my address and bank details, and they want to keep those things on file.  That's an identity thief's wet dream.

You're kind of right.  This is definitely moving away from the Bitcoin topic; but it's such a common misconception that it's worth addressing I think.
VAT is not paid (solely) by the customer, as is commonly thought, it's shared between the business and the customer.  Why?  Because VAT's presence forces the business to lower its price.
Okay... an example.  Let's say I'm a starving artist.  I paint pictures and can sell just enough to survive if I price them at £100 a picture.  That means that my (non-VAT registered) customers are willing to pay £100, and no more.  If I price them higher, I lose sales.
If I go VAT registered, then the government requires that I put 20% on everything that I sell.  My choices then:
 - Raise the price to £125, of which I will get to keep £100.  Unfortunately, my customers will not pay £120 for my pictures.
 - Lower the price so that the final inclusive price to the customer is still £100.  That means I get to keep £80.
Assume my materials cost is negligible, so I don't really gain from being able to claim VAT back, because my value-add to those materials is so high.
In reality then, the burden of VAT is shared between the business and the customer.  It's pretty obvious when you think about it... VAT does not magically make the pool of spendable money any bigger.  There are therefore marginal businesses that have no customers because 20% of that spendable pool goes to the government and hence don't exist.  All thanks to VAT.

I understand that; but you're avoiding my point completely.
The attack from blAkFlaK4 was essentially "Apple does whatever the hell they please", your defense was "Binaries submitted to Apple have to be signed by the developer's key. AFAIK this signature is still there and is being checked when the device downloads it."
That is absolutely not a defense though because you are _still_ relying on Apple.  Nothing stops them putting in their closed source iOS a check that says "check the package signature and allow it if it matches the developer name _OR_ it's signed by Apple".  Hence the developer key does nothing to stop Apple tampering with the apps -- which was the complaint.
Now, as to the new subject you've raise "Do you have your own linux binaries compiled all by yourself?".  No, of course I don't.  However, I've got a trust chain from Debian developers to my system.  That trust chain is verified by open source software.  I can download the source of any module and check it.  I don't have to -- the mere fact that it is possible already makes it more secure.  I've, in my time, submitted and fixed some minor bugs in libc that affected some project I was working on.  The same is true for millions of other developers, all of whom can potentially find security bugs too.  Is that security absolute?  No, that's impossible.  It's an order of magnitude better than the closed source world though.
I'm only "just as vulnerable" if you view vulnerability as a binary condition.  I'm vulnerable, but nowhere near the same degree as closed-source users are.

Most people pay for taxis with cash.  They don't put $300 down before they get in, and then get it returned when they don't puke.
They rely on:
 - Most people don't puke
 - If they do puke, they're usually in the car with people who haven't puked who pay up on their behalf and deal with their friend later.
 - The puker is physically in the car with you.  It's no harder to get a deposit out of someone before they puke, than after -- so what difference does it make?  I suppose there is that tiny marginal window that they puke right in front of their house, but we're really grasping at straws then.
In short: bitcoin would work fine for taxis.  It might not fit exactly Uber's current use of credit cards -- but why does that matter?  No one said bitcoin had to be implemented exactly like credit cards.  Especially as they're more like cash.

We can't predict if bitcoin will be a success, but we can certainly predict that if it is, it's volatility will be much, much lower.  It can't be otherwise -- you need more an more of an exchanged currency to move the price.  Market cap essentially gives your currency an inertia.

"Backed" cryptocurrencies are such an attractive idea.  The ability to convert a legacy currency into a digital form to some arbitrary degree would be absolutely amazing.  We could have true distributed exchanges, you could swap dollars for gold for bitcoin for rubles without ever having to touch a bank account.
It's such a shame that they are unworkable.  The problem with backed cryptorcurrency is that you take the magnificent invention that is the blockchain, allowing mutually untrusted partners to work together in a decentralised manner and make it completely dependent on one centralised authority.
Nothing stops a company saying "I will issue one unit of GoldCoin for every ounce of gold that I put in my vault; signed with a secret key that only I possess.  I will only destroy a GoldCoin unit when that ounce is removed from my vault".  It's perfectly workable.  Except for the fact that it requires complete trust in the GoldCoin issuer.  It relies on complete trust that no government will ever turn up and just confiscate the physical assets backing the cryptocurrency; or start forcing all sorts of regulations on them.  That one fact makes it a crazy idea.
Possibly, people would be willing to accept a government-issued cryptocurrency.  They seem to be okay with government-issued fiat.  Who should keep that magical key that represents the ability to create as much new currency as you wish with a button push?  If that falls into the wrong hands the whole system collapses.

You're correct we can't know it exactly; that doesn't mean we couldn't see growth.  I like to think of price as made up of component parts:
    p(t) = f(t) + v(t)
That is -- price at `t` is equal to fundamental at `t` plus volatility at `t`.  Volatility being positive or negative.  Now, if the variance of `v(t)` is in the same order of magnitude as `f(t)` we will find it difficult to know anything about `f(t)`, but the smaller `v(t)` is the more accurately we know `f(t)`.  If you're familiar with signal theory you'll recognise this as analogous to signal to noise ratios.
By observation we can see that bitcoin's volatility isn't 100% of price -- we're not varying between $0 and $1000 on small time frames.  So we already know that `f(t)` is somewhere between $300 and $1200 right now, being pessimistic about how large `v(t)` is.
If next year `p(t)` hit $5000 and we (unfairly) assume that the variance of `v(t)` doesn't shrink with larger market caps we would still be able to say that bitcoin had grown from between $300 and $1000 to at least $4000 and $5000.
Wow, that was a very convoluted way of saying that.  Sorry.


"Really worth" is a dangerous thought to have.  Nothing is "really worth" anything other than what you can get for it now.  Don't fall into the trap of being an "intrinsic value" bug.

It kind of is magic really (or should be).
When an economy grows, that means there is more wealth in it.  Assuming a steady population, that equals more wealth per person.  That extra wealth per person would manifest in the form of lower prices, leaving you able to buy more of the things you want, or save more for future buying of things you want.
We have certainly had growing economies, so where is the easier lives we should all have been getting?  The answer is that governments steal it by printing money.  Worse, they don't just steal the growth (if they did, inflation would be 0%), they steal extra, hence an inflation rate of 2% (as they report, the true rate is hard to know).
Think about it: how should a growing economy manifest itself from the point of view of an individual?

They don't understand what "legal tender" is.
Legal tender does not mean that a business is required to accept it as a form of payment.  Nor does it mean "the form that taxes must be paid in".
Legal tender has one very specific purpose: that the law will view a _debt_ to have serviced if it is paid in legal tender.  This is an important distinction because it it there to prevent creditors making up the form of repayment to suit them.  "I will be accepting payment of this debt not in dollars, but in nights of passion with your wife".  If you turn up with legal tender, then the law will consider the debt paid.
That's very different from a business owner putting a sign up "ice creams in exchange for a night of passion with your wife".  The law does not force the ice cream seller to accept dollars, but then nor does it force you to purchase the ice cream on the vendor's terms.  You are each free to do as you will.
As for taxes: tax departments have been known to take payment in kind.  Probably in negotiation with the vendor.  It's entirely at the tax office's discretion though and is entirely separate from legal tender.  Apart from the fact of course that if you pay your tax debt in legal tender, it will be considered settled in the eyes of the law, even if the tax man were to demand your house instead.
[Wikipedia]( has a good description.
In short then, from a Bitcoin perspective: it doesn't matter that much if Bitcoin is legal tender or not (it's unlikely to be for a long time).  It would be nice if a government considered a debt extinguished if it were paid in bitcoin, but it isn't the end of the world if they don't.  It just means a longer court case, should the matter ever arise.  And while exchanges exist, we'll have no trouble paying our taxes from bitcoins.
Edit: Forgot to mention the following:
None of credit cards, debit cards, or cheques are "legal tender".  It doesn't seem to have prevented them from being accepted pretty much everywhere.  The same will be true for Bitcoin -- either the merchant will accept it or he won't, "legal tender" is irrelevant.

"burdens"? HMRC aren't paying, they're collecting.  Over time HMRC have an income stream, 0 days between bill or 90 days between bill and collection, over any prolonged period is the same cash flow.  We're talking then about whether it's worth damaging property rights and giving HMRC a pickpocket license to change the revenue stream not one jot.
If a company doesn't pay any of its bills for 90 days, it doesn't gain any money, it gains the use of money for 90 days -- once and once only.  You might argue then that there is 90 days worth of interest up for grabs -- but to HMRC, that is negligible.

The important thing is that the market makes an estimate of "probability of success".  We'll never know the number, as it can be different for each participant.  When the news actually happens, that probability gets higher, so news does have an effect, but as bitcoin gets more successful that effect will get smaller and smaller.

My point is that deploying either BU or SegWit is not just a simple "well let's just do it" decision; and the reason it hasn't happened isn't because miners were all waiting for a reddit poster to tell them to do it.
Posting comments like "well it's just a matter of doing X" hides all the complexity -- both technical and political.
As an aside: personally, I suspect that both BU and SegWit are going to sit at about 33% each; with "status quo" making up the remaining 33% of mining power.  Which means we can expect neither to activate.  Regardless of how many times satoshicoin or others say "All the miners have to do is..."

Presumably though, just as Bitcoin has found its own exchange rate with every currency, it would find it's own rate with the Bolivar.  That rate would take into account the rarity of Bitcoins in Venezuela so would trade at a premium (similar to how the blackmarket USD is worth more Bolivars).
Bitcoin's divisibility would mean that a few bitcoins would be enough for the entire country -- they'd just be _very_ valuable.
In turn then, those who had any routes for money in and out of Venezuela would start arbitraging for profit -- cheap bitcoins purchased outside sent inwards, and cheap USD bought inside sent outwards.  And each currency would quickly move to its "correct" value.
That that isn't happening is, as I said, the chicken and egg problem.  Bitcoin isn't desired in Venezuela.  It really should be because Bitcoin is looking less volatile than the Bolivar lately; but mental inertia is a bitch.

That's missing the point; you are correct government can always confiscate your property, bitcoin doesn't change that.  Government has the ultimate monopoly: violence; and they're willing to use it.  When the judge says "tell us the wallet password or you're going back to prison for another month", eventually you'll roll over.
The difference with bitcoin is though that they need to use that power on the owner of the property, not the custodian of the property.  If the government turns up to your bank and says "give us money", the bank has very little incentive not to just hand it over, justified or not.  When it's you -- if you believe they are not justified, and would be able to demonstrate that in court, then you have every incentive not to hand over your property.
In short: Bitcoin can't be arbitrarily siezed by government without your permission and cooperation.  No third party can act against your wishes, as there is no third party.

One "if" actually.
I'm qualifying only because I think it's dangerous to speak of bitcoin's success as a fact.  However, bitcoin can't really end at anywhere but failure or massive success.  So the "if" is binary; and in the case of my comment, I think, justified -- if bitcoin becomes "big", then it is "big" at orders of magnitude that even Wall Street doesn't command.  A successful bitcoin is bigger than the biggest IPOs we have ever had.

The part you quoted is correct -- but they went on to completely ignore that understanding.


It is not because of legal tender laws.


You can refuse fiat when you are selling something and there is nothing anyone can do about it -- I can demand that I will only sell you my house in exchange for you shaving your head -- no legal tender law can force me to take money instead.  The vast majority of fiat exchanges (by quantity, rather than by value) are not settling debt.  Therefore there is no compunction at all.  Their argument is therefore incorrect.

I lend you 100 foobars for 10 years in 2050.
Over that 10 years, I anticipate inflation will be `x` (negative `x` being deflation).
Loss of value if I hold 100 foobars for 10 years (1 foobar in 2051 buys the same as `1*(1-x)` foobars did in 2050):
    100 * (1-x)^10 
For example, if `x` were 2% (what our current financial system aims at):
    100 * (1-0.02)^10 = 81.7
That is to say that 100 foobars in 2060 buys what 81.7 foobars did in
2050 (sitting on my money lost me some buying power).  Alternatively, if we using a deflationary currency, `x` might be -2%.
    100 * (1+0.02)^10 = 121.9
That is to say that 100 foobars in 2060 buys what 121.9 foobars did in 2050 (sitting on my money gained me some buying power).
Exactly the same calculation can be done for my mortgage, but instead of `x`, the percentage is `y` where `y` is the total I'll charge you.  We can think of `y` as being `(x-z)`, where `z` is the "over inflation" part.  Also note that it's perfectly possible for `z` to be larger than `x` in an inflationary world: that would mean the lender beats inflation, and they lose no buying power at all.  In a deflationary world, they were already beating inflation, so it's always a negative `(x-z)`.
It should be pretty clear then that I would be willing to lend to you in the two example cases, provided I ended up better than I was by simply sitting on my money.
 - 2% inflation: provided I end up with more than 81.7 2050-foobars of buying power in 2060, then I have profited.
 - 2% deflation: provided I end up with more than 121.9 2050-foobars of buying power in 2060, then I have profited.
I will select my interest rate appropriately that when combined with what I judge the risk of lending to you to be, I profit.  If I do that over many individuals, the risk with any one default is (in theory) spread over all, so I can pick average risk and average inflation for my figures.
The question then becomes: is that worth it for _you_?  Would you be better off saving and deferring your purchase for 10 years, or do you value the use of the purchase now more than the purchasing power you lose?  You will also factor in (in the case of a mortgage) that you will have to rent somewhere to live, and the appreciation of the house you do or don't buy. Hopefully it's clear that that question is the same regardless of what the inflation/deflation rate is (although the answer might be different for any individual).
An economy will automatically adjust to any value of inflation or deflation; so there is no disaster either way.  What is a disaster is when the anticipated value turns out to be wildly wrong, which happens when we get hyper-inflation (when governments/banks create money massively) or hyper-deflation (most likely because of an economic collapse, and money becomes the only reliable place to store value).
Practically; it might be that people aren't willing to accept mortgages because they lose too much in a deflationary world.  That will be excellent though because it will act as a downward pressure on house prices -- preventing more property (or any other asset class for that matter) bubbles.  At some point, that lower price results in a mortgage deal that _is_ acceptable -- the gain of a house is worth more than the lost purchasing power.

This is apples and oranges.
The cost-per-transaction is including the miner reward.  That is paid by every holder of bitcoin in the form of inflation.  However, if there were zero transactions, then that inflation would be identical.  If there were ten times as many transactions that inflation would be identical.  The "cost-per-transaction" would be completely different though.
It's reasonable for the purposes of statistics to call it "cost-per-transaction", but it shouldn't be taken as meaning an additional transaction adds that much cost -- it doesn't.  In truth an additional transaction _lowers_ the average cost.
Exactly the same misunderstanding is used, for example, by hospitals who take the total cost of, say, an MRI machine, and then divide that by the number of MRI scans they do to work out how much each scan "costs".  It's nonsense though -- the machine doesn't cost any more or less because you do a scan with it.

So I escape poverty by having wealth (which Bitcoin lets me save)?
What nonsense. That implies that poverty is caused because the poor had wealth but it was taken from them. Which is manifestly untrue.
The thing that keeps the people of the world who are in true poverty that way is that they are prevented from trading freely with the rest of the world so that they can _earn_ wealth in the first place. The solution to that is not a store of value (they have no value to store) it is a means of payment.
Bitcoin could have been that digital, borderless, cash. It's pretty clear it's going to be digital gold.
Also: what use is wealth if it can't be spent?  If Bitcoin can only be spent by converting it to some local currency, then your sovereignty means nothing because it can be blocked at the point of conversion.  Wealth is only wealth because it represent future expenditure.  To be truly financially sovereign both the wealth and the future expenditure must be free from interference.

That's not really it.  It's 2nd factor so still requires that a first factor (i.e. a secret) is stored on the remote server and that I send it over the wire -- and is therefore probably _still_ stored in my browser's password cache anyway.  With this recent CloudFlare leak, all the second factor secrets could have been leaking too anyway, so this U2F thing wouldn't really have helped (unless I'm not reading deeply enough into it).
What I'm looking for is, for example, a standard that says if the browser sees `&lt;input type='identitychallenge' challenge='some_long_random_number'&gt;&lt;/input&gt;` in a `&lt;form&gt;` it automatically signs `some_long_random_number` with my private key (which is therefore never sent) and submits the form with that `&lt;input&gt;` filled in with the signature.
Then we can also have `&lt;input type='identity_public_key'&gt;` and have the browser fill _that_ in so that registration happens automatically too.
With those two things (or equivalents) in place -- all those remote sites are storing is a public key -- which is public knowledge anyway.  So if they have a break in, all the hacker gets is the ability to verify hundreds of identities -- not to impersonate them.

You've got a downvote -- use it.  Other than that -- why is your opinion of what goes on news feeds any more important than the person who posts it?
Of course Bitcoin _can_ be used everywhere: it's a cash replacement.  But if you can't see that there are some businesses that are better suited as early adopters than others then you haven't thought about it hard enough.
Bitcoin's current success has come about because of grass roots efforts to get it adopted.  Some of that is from one reddit user saying "here's a company that would gain immediate and excessive benefit from using bitcoin" and others saying "hey, I use that company, I'll join in your campaigning" -- new company gets some query emails, and eventually adopts bitcoin because "what the hell?".
In short: those posts have, and will continue to have a positive effect on bitcoin adoption.  If that messes up your news feed because you've got to scroll an extra 20 pixels, that's a price I'm willing to pay.

Unfortunately, that's a subjective opinion ("when one evaluates").  If I go and ask someone on a different sub, they'll say the same thing with a different conclusion.
You do see that that's the problem, right? In disagreements as exist now in Bitcoin, it is obvious to both sides that _they_ are the ones who are in the right; and it's obvious to the other side that they are wrong.  Hence the current impasse.  So... I got back to my original assertion: this is a political problem.  Exactly the same mindsets exist when countries go to war ("We're right; and that's the end of it" -- both sides), the solution is diplomacy and compromise, not bigger megaphones.

I think you're confused -- there is no way to run an exchange on _fractional_ reserve.  "Full reserve" means that every dollar or bitcoin on deposit is available for demand withdrawal -- if you add up every customer balance, then the company has that full amount in the safe, on deposit, or in a wallet.  That means it is not only possible, but _desireable_ that an exchange be full reserve.
Bail outs are only necessary in fractional reserve systems where the central bank is the lender of last resort, who gets a call in the event of a bank run.
Bitstamp have, in the past, demostrated that they have every bitcoin deposited with them in reserve.  That doesn't guarantee anything for now of course -- but then that would make them non-full reserve.

I'm not sure it matters which is more representative.  The only "cash" the world has ever really experienced (certainly the modern world) is fiat, government issued, government debased.  But don't think there is anything inherent about cash that means it can't be cash and yet not fixed supply.  Gold would be perfectly acceptable as cash except for the practicalities: it can't be easily divided, it can't be easily assayed, it's not very conveniently transported, can't be digitised without turning it into an IOU -- importantly, it's fixed supply is _not_ in that list.
In that respect Bitcoin (et al) are an economic experiment, the like of which has never been seen: a cash that is (practically) incorruptible.  It cannot be debased, and cannot be inflated.  It's infinitely divisible (with a bit of field-size extension should it be needed) so can always be practical.

I don't think there is a reasonable comparison.  Bitcoin is a black swan event -- like the invention and proliferation of the Internet itself, it will only happen once in human history.
If anything though Bitcoin is even more revolutionary because the Internet wasn't replacing any incumbant system, it was adding new capabilities.  Bitcoin is actively replacing massive vested interests and massive earlier investment in infrastructure.  At its absolute most successful level it's probably going to turn some of the largest and richest corporations into buggy whip manufacturers.
In short: even if we think of Bitcoin as merely an "application platform", that platform is so ingrained, so inherent in every single facet of modern life that comprehending the potential scale is close to impossible.


The reason I used the word "ridiculous" is because it demonstrates a lack of appreciation of the above.  It's like asking Gutenberg why it took him until 1455 to print the Gutenberg bible when he'd invented the press in 1439.  After all, it's just another mechanical thingamgig and if it was going to change the world it should have done it by 1440.

We're talking about what, a year's worth of interest on the delayed taxes -- which is itself a minute percentage of the totatl tax take.  They get the use of that once, and only once.  No additional taxes are collected.
It's certainly not the difference between 30% and 40%.  However, to use your figures, if they can't get 30% today, then they could borrow that 10% for the period in question (although, I might suggest that they simply not spend the money they don't have yet -- delay breaking ground on that hospital for a year), then pay it back.  Then we're only talking about the interest -- which is very, very low (it might even be negative at the moment) for the government on that 10%.
In short: I understand that there is benefit to the use of the money; but on the scale of a country's finances the amounts in question are tiny.  It's the government-rate interest for the small percentage of HMRC taxes that have been taken to a court case and ruled in favour of.  For that, we're going to give HMRC this unheard of ability, to directly take money from your bank account.
Slightly tangential: but given how small the amounts in question are, we should start considering the damage to the economy of making people suspicious of keeping their money in their bank; which until now has been as good as keeping it in your pocket.  The precedent to businesses that the government controls their bank accounts is a dangerous one.  Cyprus doing similar things likely did very little for their reputation as an international finance centre.

This is always the argument against new technology ... "what about all those jobs that will be lost when everyone uses cars instead of buggies, calculators instead of slide rules, tractors instead of humans?".
That's looking at the world incredibly pessmistically.  The truth is that technology isn't destroying jobs, it's freeing up resource.  All those people who used to have to work on the fields just to feed themselves now can dedicate that time and effort to creation of value elsewhere, without losing the value that was created from farming.
The long and short is that those trillions of expenses for running the finance industry are currently a cost on us all -- making us all poorer.

Well it was kind of rhetorical; I know full well that bank accounts can't be decentralised.  That was kind of my point.  One exchange -- one (centralised) bank account.  You need somewhere to pay your fiat to.
Bitcoin has built in the ability to decentralise, so that half isn't the problem.
The only way I can see a decentralised exchange working is if many people are willing to open many bank accounts and one of them is picked at random when anyone wants to deposit.  Each of those holders would then enter all deposits and obey all instructions to withdraw as issued by the decentralised mechanism (I'd guess a separate blockchain, as that's a known working system).
The problem of course is obvious -- trust -- you can't trust any of those "decentralised" account holders to be doing as they are instructed.  Hence my "only way to decentralise" is completely impractical.
And so:


... and for completeness ... and they _can't_ be decentralised; so tough shit.
The best we've got are "exchanges" like localbitcoins, which decentralise exactly as I've described, but rely enormously on trust, which we mitigate a bit with a feedback system.  These aren't real exchanges though -- there isn't a proper order book, and you have to deal with each seller/buyer independently.

There will be _approximately_ 21 million.  But there will never quite be 21 million.
Bitcoin follows (essentially, just scaled up by 210,000x100):
   S = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ...
The sum of such a series is 1, but only with an infinite number of terms.  With anything less than an infinite number of terms, the sum is a tiny bit less than one.
Similarly, bitcoin will never quite reach 21 million coins.  That's especially true given that the width of the field in the protocol is finite too -- so even if we had an infinite number of terms in the series, the protocol is incapable of representing anything smaller than eight decimal places.  It's actually a binary field so it's not quite correct to talk about decimal places; but near enough, when the reward is 0.00000001, then the next halving will result in the reward being, 0.00000000, since there is no space for the ninth place.  Now, we might add more places, but there will always be a finite amount of storage.
So you see: there will never be 21 millions coins.
Obviously, i don't think that matters, as I said, about 12 years will put us near enough to the asymptotic 21 million, that we're just splitting hairs.... but then you started it...

Since we're discussing what bitcoin is potentially worth, let's say in 10-15 years, then we divide our potential market cap by the appoximate number of coins that will have been mined then.
That there are only 14 million now doesn't matter, because no one is expecting to wake up tomorrow with a trillion dollar bitcoin market cap.

Not "a lot" ... specifically "all".  Then you refuse to use them.
I was (perhaps incorrectly) assuming a (stupid) nefarious plan from the quote:


The only way to even attempt a f requires to own some first ... I was addressing the hypothetical of them using their massive resources to kill bitcoin in standard Wall Street fashion -- buy it then burn it.
Obviously that wouldn't work.  That was what I was saying.
I'm not really sure what you're trying to tell me actually -- that Bitcoin can't be killed, or it can.  I'm saying it can't.


The problem with that is in the very name "short".. If you're short of bitcoin you are eventually going to have to buy them back.  Not such a good way of killing something.


That argument is always true for something as thinly traded as Bitcoin.  But like all of these hypotheticals, it requires you to cut off your own leg to beat your opponent with it.


And yet it didn't happen... and could still happen now, but doesn't.  What do you reckon would be the result if one exchange has really cheap bitcoins while others don't?  Arbitrage profits would be huge.  And would instantly act to move the price away from zero.

@_date: 2015-01-15 10:41:32
Okay, I was sloppy with that sentence, but remember I said it in the context of a link to an EV article.
The important thing is that if your estimate of the probablity of bitcoin hitting $SOME_HUGE_NUMBER is above some threshold then it becomes a sensible bet -- and I would happily call it investing not gambling.
It's not the same as buying a lottery ticket, since the win is still not big enough to outweigh the massive unlikeliness of you winning in the first place.
Let me give you an example (using just the mega win for a lottery, and UK odds as I'm more familiar with our lottery):
 - Cost of lottery ticket, £1
 - Amount won £5,000,000 (say)
 - Chance of winning: 1/13,000,000
 - Expected value: `-1*12999999/13000000 + 4999999*1/13000000 = -0.6153846154`
So for every pound I gamble on the lottery, I expect to lose 61p of it in the long run.  _Even if I win big_.
For bitcoin, we can't calculate the odds as it's not got fixed possibilities, so we have to make some estimates.
 - Amount "invested", £1
 - Future "win" price of bitcoin, 10000x what it is today
 - Future "lose" price of bitcoin, 0
 - Chance of bitcoin "winning", say 1 in thousand, pessimistically (personally I think we're passed the stage were it's anywhere near that low, too much infrastructure has been built, but I'm trying to play fair)
 - Expected value: `-1*999/1000 + 10000*1/1000 = 9.0010000000`
See?  Even saying bitcoin only succeeds 1 time in 1000, even when I lose 100% of my investment 999 times out of a thousand, it's got an expected value of £9 for every £1 I invest -- that would make it an investment not a gamble.
Now, obviously, you can pick whatever estimates suit you, I'm not arguing that mine are correct.  What I'm saying is that when you make your estimates and calculate the EV, if that EV comes out greater than one then you are investing, because you don't expect to lose out in the long term.  If it comes out less than one you are gambling because you do expect to lose out in the long term.
Remember EV doesn't tell you what will happen, it's still probabilities, and there are still risks.  You can play the lottery and win in week one, then never play again, coming out ahead.  But the point of EV is to allow you to quantify the risk/reward.  Gambling is daft because EV says you lose, investing/speculating is sensible because EV says you will win.

Exactly as I have said: they would have misunderstood where the value in bitcoin was.  I would take their $10 million and buy bitcoin 2.0 coins, which I would imagine would already be well established thanks to the infrastructure that's already in place.

It's only one step up from the usual misguided stuff from central banks.
And the idea that inflation has been well managed over the last 30 years, when currencies have lost 90% of their value in that time is laughable.
As usual, he's mixed up about the competition issue.  That altcoins are possible doesn't devalue bitcoin.  Bitcoin's value is 100% in the infrastructure and existing network -- it's absolutely not in its selected parameters (although one might argue it would never have reached it's current success without that particular selection).  That's easy to demonstrate, since it's trivial to take the bitcoin source, exactly as is, and make it issue a new genesis block, making a new Bitcoinish chain.  In all other respects it would be identical to Bitcoin and yet, the coins on it would not be worth even one thousandth of a bitcoin -- why?  Because it doesn't have any network effect benefits.
Exactly the same would be true of any other altcoin -- they are not slot-in replacements, they would have to prove themselves in the market as significantly better than Bitcoin (and simultaneously not have benefits that Bitcoin could simply integrate) to overcome Bitcoin's now, near unassailable, network effect.

I don't think signing should be used as an indication of code review.  Strictly you don't sign for identity either (it's perfectly reasonable to sign the key of a pseudonym); although many do.  You sign for control of an identity.
So, if I believe key 0x12345678 is controlled by user (i.e. that email can generate a signature with that key) then I can sign as verified.
Once your own key is trusted, then your signature on the multibit signing key confers your trust in it -- those that trust you can then trust the signing key.  There's no real reason for reviewers to sign the multibit key.

This is where I started though: no one argues that double spend is possible.  The demonstrations are all to online sites, and primarily to sites that just credit an account (as opposed to purchasing something).  That is a much bigger attack surface.  It's not so easy in the particular circumstance of an in-person retail buy. It's even harder to do it undetected.  And even if you manage to make it over all those hurdles, and they are non-trivial, you end up having won the price of a coffee.  The logic for prohibiting zero-conf does not stack up.
And yet every time this point is raised, the response is "well of course double spend is possible". And round we go again, exactly as you've done.

There is absolutely no way, absent of statements from their owners, to distinguish between saved bitcoins and lost bitcoins.

I agree it could fail -- but I don't think it can be killed.  If Bitcoin fails now, it will because it has itself failed, not because some external actor prevented it.


Not entirely.  Imagine that all other things are equal.  When the short is opened, some bitcoins are sold, so the price drops by X.  When the short is closed the same number of bitcoins are bought, so the price rises by X.
A completed short then doesn't affect the price in the slightest -- now, if the market moves in the meantime then of course you make a profit, but that was because the market moved, not because you shorted.
If all of bitcoin's price drop over the last year were down to shorts, then as they were closed, bitcoin's price would have to restore to where it started.  Of course the price drop isn't entirely down to shorts, because some of it is true market sentiment changing, but some is (as you correctly point out):


i.e. those who are merely positive feedback automata and think "price going down, sell" have all sold.
But if that's the case, then exactly the opposite manipulation surely must apply when the shorts all close?  Inexorable upward movement resulting in those same unthinking automata saying "price going up, buy"?
It's that reasoning that makes me expect another grand, even bigger, bubble eventually.  Inevitably.


I think you're right.  I am always a little perturbed by those who castigate the "get rich quick" types who are around -- the horrible truth is that greed is what is going to get Bitcoin to become successful.  It is the hope of profit that will bring people flooding to our doors; and what's so wrong about that?  Especially when we consider that the people who are going to supply that profit are going to be the late-adopting financial institutions who will refuse to hold bitcoin until the moment comes when they can refuse no longer.  And a more just redistribution of funds, I cannot conceive.

You do own them, you just can't take physical possession of them.
Your bitcoin address is a public key, the matching private key signs your instructions to the network as to what you want done with your owned bitcoins.

All other things (mainly the level of technology) being equal, difficulty follows price.  So on a falling market price we'd _always expect a falling hash rate.  It doesn't tell us anything other that that -- price has fallen; and we didn't need the hashrate to tell us that.
Some miners will probably ride out a few unprofitable bumps, but won't sustain.  Therefore we can probably think of hashrate as a low-pass-filtered proxy for price rather than being directly proportional.  So there's actually less information in hash-rate than there is in price.

In the last 100 years, USD has lost over 90% of its value.  With no collapses.
If we take the optimistic view that the inflation target of 2% will be met; then in the next 30 years, that will be `1.02^30 = 81%` inflation.

The gold standard existed, but it didn't prevent government [from debasing the currency](  It was just clear that they'd done it because they had to change the amount of gold a dollar was worth. (The Romans, for example, lowered the gold content of the physical gold coins; so it's pretty clear very little actually stops governments from doing it).


My point is that isn't a property of gold over cash; it's a property of fixed-supply vs fiat.


That's nothing to do with what we're discussing, which is whether "gold or cash is more representative of a non-inflating system" (to paraphrase your post).  I'm arguing that neither is -- inflation is not inherent to cash.

That's a terrible measure.
If there were a single transaction, say for 1 BTC, in a block.  Then the 25BTC reward on that block, by your logic, would be a 25000% transaction fee -- except there was only 1BTC involved, so that transaction _cannot possibly_ have paid the fee.  Ergo, it wasn't a transaction fee.
The 25BTC is paid regardless of the transactions, so to call it a cost on the transactions is nonsense.  It's like those hospital administrators who take the price of the MRI machine and divide it by the number of scans to come up with a cost-per-scan.  Nonsense again.  Once you've bought the machine it's a sunk cost -- the more scans you do the better, each one doesn't "cost" you.
The same is true of the bitcoin network.  All BTC owners are paying for the network to collect and secure transactions -- that cost is sunk in that it's going to happen, and there is nothing that can be done about it.  Trying to treat that as if it were a transaction cost is simply wrong, since it's entirely orthogonal to the transactions or any fees paid by users.

It was genuinely mine.  It felt like it bent to my control rather than me having to jump through some gatekeeper's hoops to decide where it should go.  I have slowly trickled fiat into bitcoin for years now, and I don't care what its current value is.  I'm certain that eventually the world will see it as I do: the most ownable property there is.

Obviously I meant there are two choices in this particular argument (solving the miner's desire to be mining at the current tip as soon as possible with this patch), not two choices in the entire world.
The problem that core wants to prevent by not raising block limits is that some miners don't have enough bandwidth to receive bigger blocks quickly. How can you argue then that the reason this solution isn't valid is because they could carry on mining the current tip while they download and validate? Their bandwidth problems mean they are the most likely to lose that block race. That makes your choice effectively the same as my first option: switch off your hashing power for the duration of the download and validate.
I think you exaggerate on lite clients. The blocks still get validated and there is still no incentive to produce blocks that will be later rejected, hence the mined block you haven't yet validated is more than likely valid. So the network won't be flooded with invalid blocks. And most of the time they won't be mined in that small window anyway. The lite client assumption will remain as true as it is now. And let's remember that trusting an invalid block is the risk you take as a lite client whether this change were implemented or not. You should be waiting for your six confirmations regardless.
Lite clients have exactly the problems you describe with orphan blocks, which already occur and aren't the end of the world. So what does it matter if they see some additional orphans?

For comparison, a kilowatt hour costs about 18p in the uk. Each of these 9 devices costs £2300 each and so costs the same as filling itself 1200 times.
Petrol is, coincidentally about 10kWh per litre. Yes "per litre". Costs about 1.15 pounds per litre at time of writing in the uk. And fits in a jug. So he's asking for 3500 dollars for the same amount of energy storage as a jug has.

The beauty of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is that the scarcity is mathematical.  Yes, you could destroy bitcoin 1.0 by buying them all then refusing to let anyone have any -- "ha ha ha I am an evil banker who just used my massive resources to make all you bitcoiners rich, but at least there's no more bitcoin because I've got them all."
The problem with that bitcoin 2.0 is a new genesis block away.  If there _really_, really were no bitcoin 1.0 left to use (and I don't think it's practically possible in truth), it's simple to make bitcoin 2.0 and all the infrastructure would still be in place.
The mistake is to think that bitcoin itself is inherently special.  It's not.  It's the network and the infrastructure around it that's special.  And it's that that gives bitcoin its worth.  Buying all the bitcoins wouldn't do a thing to the infrastructure.

Who knows, I might be wrong, but all economic history has always said "this time it's different" and it never was. So I choose optimism.
Let's also remember that we're talking about jobs in the finance industry here... Never was there more parasitic set of jobs. Even if we have to pay them all welfare when those jobs vanish, we will be considerably richer than with them taking a cut of every transaction we make.

There's nothing wrong with a forced push.  I've used them on a few of my projects to correct silly mistakes; usually pushing the tip of my working tree which just has a "hold until I tidy this mess up into individual commits" patch rather than the actual tip that I want to push to a public repo.
The difference in this case is that they aren't fixing a silly mistake.
The fun part is that since the LGPL version has been pulled by others in the meantime, there is actually no way to remove that history completely.  Any one of the people with the old version can now just push it back and voila, the bad behaviour is clear.
If it weren't bad behaviour, all the cloners would simply say "oh I see what he's done" and move to the new forced push version.  It is bad behaviour though, so that's exactly what the won't do.

What?  I've never heard of this guy.  Why would his comments in particular be the reason for a sudden plunge?  It's not like there have never been negative comments about bitcoin before.




It hasn't been a good investment for the last year, but since it was going down in price, that's hardly a surprise.  It doesn't tell us whether bitcoin is going to go up or down _from now_.  And if you were going to invest, then buying at a bottom would be a far better time to invest than at the top.  Using this journalists logic would have your buys and sells in exact anti-phase with the profitable times.  "Bitcoin has had its best year ever... now is the time to buy"  "Bitcoin has had its worst year ever... now is the time to sell".


"Justify"?  There's no "justify" in a market.  There's no justification for a $1 bitcoin, a $5 bitcoin, a $100 bitcoin or a $1000 bitcoin.  The price is the price -- none of them are any more justified than any other.  What "justifies" today's $215?  Why is it worth 50% more than it was a few days ago?


Yeah, hindsight is easy.  Calls like this are only impressive at the time, not after watching the price decay back for a year and then shouting "that was a bubble".  No shit, any fool can see that now.


Who said that?  "Indefinitely" might as well be "I call it infinity times, double, triple stamped, no take backs, times infinity squared".  At $1000 I would still think Bitcoin would have room to grow.  That's not the same as "indefinitely" though.  It didn't -- doesn't change my opinion -- "bitcoin still has room to grow".

That's simply not so.
A derivative work is anything that uses any of the original.  I'll allow that my renaming bits of Windows would be a silly example and wouldn't create a derivative work in copyright.


That's simply not so either.  If you sample a song, you are deriving from it and you _do_ owe compensation.
I think you're confusing what a derivative work really is.  A derivative work is something that is different enough to be considered "new" and have it's own additional copyright -- that in no way removes the original work's copyright though and a license is needed from the originator.


The rights of the original work's author mean that the derivative work must be authorised.  I accept, that the derivative author gets a new copyright -- but that's useless unless they have permission to distribute the original work too.

But it's not true to say it is "as useful" at any price. It's useful at any price but it is more useful at higher prices because more values can be moved with it.

You have two different questions as the unbanked are not the same as the capital controlled.
Answer1: Argentina and Venezuela have shit currencies. That makes it very hard to find either someone willing to accept their shit for bitcoins or for them to purchase a non shit currency to trade internationally for bitcoins.
Answer2: the unbanked have poor access, or at least delayed access, to technology. Smartphones powerful enough to run bitcoin and cellular networks with sufficient coverage to run bitcoin are not yet commonplace amongst the unbanked.
Both of these problems will resolve themselves with time. Self sustaining bitcoin economies will form in countries with capital controls, making currency exchange less and less necessary. And technology will trickle down to third world countries.

Bitcoin (or whichever cryptocurrency "wins") is just going to change/add to who is in the 1%; not remove the 1%.
Anyone in the 99% can buy a ticket to be in the next 1% right now, today.  How many of them would you guess have or will?  I'd say less than 1%.
A few of today's rich people will be late to the party and will have to buy bitcoins at hugely inflated prices; and that's what's going to make the bitcoin-1% rich.  However, it's not many, and it's not enough to wipe out rich people -- why?  Because they're already rich, and they don't keep their wealth in the form of fiat stuffed under the bed.
Bitcoin is going to change the world; but don't kid yourself -- it's not going to make (generally) poor people rich and rich people poor.  What it might do is remove the parasitical source of income for some of the rich -- those who work in the financial gatekeeping industries are going to have their income stream curtailed.  _That_ money will end up making society richer; so the 99% will have slightly easier lives.  But Bitcoin is not going to result in political revolution, only financial.

The fraud is just the other way around.  If you sent me an RBF transaction, then cancelled it with RBF.

You should consider that money gone.
Whatever the fraud risks of zero-conf -- exactly the same fraud risks exist for RBF, just with the victim and perpetrator swapped.

I'm not dismissing; I'm disagreeing.  I'm taking time to respond to you as well, so please don't treat me like I'm just here to waste your time.


If that were so then Bitcoin is fundamentally broken.


But that means that this is _already_ the case, and nothing to do with the patch under discussion.  I'm fully aware that non-verifying miners are dangerous; that SPV is risky.  Those are already true though, and head-first mining doesn't change that.  If anything head-first mining will give those relying on other miners not to be so cavalier about the number of confirmations they require.
Block reorgs are a fact of life with Bitcoin -- whether because of invalid blocks, orphans, or large proof-of-work improvements.


I understand Poisson processes.  You said:


So 10% of blocks are currently mined quickly; of them some percentage would be mined invalid in the "head first" scheme.  Let's be pessimistic and say 10% again.  That's 1% of blocks would be orphaned -- and would waste a little hashing power.  It's certainly not "substantial".


You keep showing me that (which occurred with no head-first mining); but it's like showing me a cheque signed by Mickey Mouse for $1,000,000 -- you can put anything you want in a transaction and you can put anything you want in a block if you are a miner.  Including awarding yourself 1,000 BTC reward.  So what? What matters is if the rest of the network accepts it (miners and nodes included).  You can do bad things like that now, and head-first mining doesn't change that.  What matters is if it was accepted by anyone.
Orphans are nothing other than a block that is (eventually or instantly) not built on by the rest of the network.  The reasons for orphaning a block are nothing to do with whether it's an orphan or not.  So orphans absolutely can do that -- the reason that that transaction you link to didn't manage to steal every bitcoin in existence is because any block it was in would be orphaned (as it should have been).


It seems like the argument against head-first mining is that it would continue to keep people who are at risk, at risk.  Well yes, would anyone think anything but that?  Miners that don't move off invalid chains because they're longer are doomed anyway.

You missed the final step... massive sell off to collect the profits and grab the other side.
So... they bought upwards, triggering all the _stop buy_ orders from other people.  Then instantly sold everything they'd bought at $1336.4.  That caused the massive drop... which in turn triggered all the people on the _stop sell_ side, who auto sold into the whale's sell off.  Then they rebought their original position, at presumably less than it had originally cost.
Very clever.
Beware people: when others know your stop-loss orders, you can be manipulated.  And now is a time when we can take a damned good guess about the location of massive quantities of stop-loss orders.

So the problem is getting bitcoins?
Sounds like what's needed is bitcoiners to visit Venezuela and buy stuff, or for Venezualeans to export something that bitcoiners want to import (don't know how feasible that is politically).
That in turn sounds like a problem -- as it's the same fundamental problem (only writ large) that bitcoiners have everywhere -- customers don't have bitcoins because merchants don't accept bitcoins and merchants don't accept bitcoins because customers don't have bitcoins.  In that sense then -- dollars don't really come into it -- they are just one more common export that a bitcoiner is likely to want to import.

A hard fork _would_ be just changing constant.
It's the consensus-code that is complicated.  And that is common to both SegWit and a block size increase, so we can ignore that bit.  In fact, nothing would stop the purportedly marvellous SegWit soft-fork code having the consensus-signalling part tweaked to do the consensus checking for a BU hard fork -- so again, we can ignore that part when comparing.
All that matters is how complex SegWit itself is versus a block sized increase for this particular statement.  And SegWit is unarguably more complex that increasing the block size.  So it's a complete straw man.

They can't print new bitcoins; they can promise more bitcoins.  It's the problem of third party trust.
Just like (ignoring the mining of more) you can't create more gold, but you can easily print two certificates representing the same mass of gold.  Which is essentially the fractional reserve system: more than one owner of a single asset.
The third party trust problem exists everywhere of course, but bitcoin (or rather cryptocurrencies in general) allow you to remove the third party and trust only yourself.

They're hardly the same thing in terms of the technical background (there are more considerations than just that of course).
The hard fork to a 2MB chain would use exactly the same software that has been working for years but with a new value for a constant and a rebuild.  The soft fork to SegWit is considerably more complex.
Now that isn't necessarily an argument for doing it, but this is a silly comparison.
@_date: 2017-03-10 08:06:14
Bitcoin is not a mathematical deterministic solution to that problem. It's a practical probabilistic solution. Effectively each cycle of the messenger in the two generals problem makes the outcome more and more a statistically likely truth... Never 100%... But we don't give a shit about that when we mix in the fact that you would need a hidden computer more powerful than the sum of all other supercomputers in the world to find your way into that risky diminishing gap to 100%.
So it's mathematically possible that Bitcoin is about to be destroyed, but practically impossible.
Sounds to me like the difference between mathematics (PhD or not) and engineering is the key here. The mathematician will tell you you can't know exactly what the value of pi is. The engineer uses 3.142 and the bridges all stay standing anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:16:20
If it had enough support, that is exactly all it would need.
The signaling mechanism is only to find out if others agree with you to prevent you wasting your hashing power on a block that the rest of the miners will reject. It is not the fork itself. In fact every orphan block is technically a fork. An unsuccessful one. And that happens with zero code changes.
Since segwit needs a very similar mechanism, the relative difference between the two can ignore that part.
@_date: 2016-03-17 06:10:25
There are two choices:
 - stop mining while you receive the full block and validate it. During this time you are not hashing and cannot generate a block. The originator of the block already has the full block so can continue mining. At the end of this period you definitely have made no new valid block.
 - mine using the block header given to you by the originator without validating. While doing this you are receiving and validating the full block. You find a block before this validation is finished. Either (a) that block turns out to be invalid when you (and the rest of the network) validate it and your mining time was wasted (b) the originator didn't lie and the block you based on turns out to be valid. Neither of these cases is dangerous, just one results in you having wasted a bit of hashing power in exchange for doing something useful while the probably valid block you received is downloaded and validated.
Exactly where is the attack on the network here? It's the equivalent of mining an orphan because it's a block that subsequently gets rejected by the rest of the network. It doesn't weaken security because the alternative was for the miner to not use their hashing power for the same period, so Bitcoin was weaker by that hashing power in either case.

There is a lot of distance between 1MB and infinity.
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:44:30
You miss what I'm saying.
To hard fork, all you would need to do is change a constant.  If sufficient miners did that, that's a fork done -- 51% of the hash power producing 2MB blocks is a fork.  The difficult part is the consensus code (which I don't say isn't necessary to do it safely).  But that's nothing to do with a hard fork, that's to try and make any hard fork gentle.
Even though SegWit is a soft-fork it actually includes a similar mechanism.  Both BU and SegWit implement signalling and only activate when a threshold is reached -- in which case we can ignore that part when comparing complexity -- since it's common to both.
@_date: 2016-01-11 22:41:27
Yes; I'm quite aware of computers, thank you.
If it's so simple then, go to it.
It only seems to work when it's possible to try all day on a credit balance system, and then report how easy it is when one attempt works.  That's called Texas sharp-shooting.
To make this work as you describe, it needs wide network connectivity, and probably the collusion of a miner with plenty of hashing power.  If your double transaction makes it anywhere near the rest of the network it can be detected as a double spend attempt while you're stood in the shop, face to face with the retailer who has just seen a "this person is robbing you" message flash up on their tablet.
If Bitcoin Core included the patch that makes it announce the second transaction as well, then the detection becomes even easier.  Instead, they're pushing for full-RBF.

It is, but it's an important efficiency saving. The primary argument against bigger blocks is because of the burst bandwidth problem after a block is found basically "pricing out" miners with poor connectivity. This optimisation vastly reduces that burst bandwidth, which in principle mitigates that objection.
In that sense it offers far more than just an improvement for the bandwidth impaired, it makes bigger blocks more practical.

Yes I know. But when the float you're comparing against is tiny in comparison, saying it lost 11% is just foolish.

If I issue my own crypto currency which is worth nothing on day one and 0.000001 dollars on day two, did the USD just lose an infinite amount against my shit coin?
I'm not disputing the maths or the mechanism. I'm disputing the language. Expressing it that way around is fanboyism, it's trying to make out that the dollar lost, when the dollar measured against the basket of every other thing in the world didn't move one measurable bit.

This isn't a good way to express it. The dollar buys as much today as it did yesterday, so clearly the dollar didn't change. Bitcoin buys more than it did yesterday, and one way of expressing that is in dollars.
But measure both against "loaves of bread" or"gallons of oil" and it's clear which one moved 11%

Seems like 7% would be in the margin of random variation. At least partially.
If chance resulted in a difficulty adjustment period with an excess of harder blocks, the difficulty adjustment algorithm will lower difficulty. The next period might then be easier, again, simply by chance. All with exactly the same number of hashes per second.

Erm... I think BU _should_ have rejected it.  BU nodes are willing to activate a larger block size, but surely they aren't going to accept them until the activation threshold has been reached?
The threshold is meant to prevent a contentious fork, so accepting large blocks would just leave you on a rejected fork until you're sure you have network support -- BU obviously doesn't yet, so no one should have expected a large block to cause a chain fork -- BU node or otherwise.
Presumably they knew this: so isn't this just a test?  More interesting is the banning behaviour -- is BitcoinD so twitchy that it bans any node that forwards an invalid block?  I'm not sure that's necessarily a good thing -- might be an opportunity for a DoS in the future.

All the arguments for RBF go like this:
"Zero conf was potentially not safe because collaboration with a miner could get your double spend transaction into the next block; so we should be explicit about that and make it so it doesn't require miner collaboration"
No one ever seems to point out that _exactly_ the same situation is true for RBF supported; just with different victims.  Let's say I buy a coffee, the merchant refuses the RBF transaction so I use my RBF-supporting wallet to reverse it (let's ignore the insanity of this situation) by issuing a new transaction with higher fee returning my money to myself.  I've basically done a chargeback at my own discretion.
"RBF is potentially not safe because the merchant can collaborate with a miner to mine the original transaction, ignoring the chargeback transaction, and undouble spend -- they might even offer them a fee to do so."
So, essentially RBF doesn't fix anything, it just shifts the party at risk to being the sender rather than the receiver.

If they mean cryptocurrency rather than digital currency, which I guess they do... this will be sooooo funny.
Bitcoin issues new units by virtue of the preprogrammed supply creation rules combined with the clever self-limiting by PoW difficulty adjustment.  Key thing: decentralised.
A centralised cryptocurrency would need an issuer.  That can work in theory by keeping some magical secret key that controls the signing of new valid units.  However, in practice centralised organisations are extraordinarily poor at keeping digital secrets.  All it will take is one USB key with that magic secret key on it being stolen/copied, and suddenly everyone on the Internet could "print" themselves as much money as they want.  Quantitive easing my standard of living ... so basically the unit would become instantly worthless.  Now... if they made the even bigger mistake of making the digital unit pegged to the traditional unit... the traditional unit is then worthless too.
Note for bandwagon-jumping centralised nut bags then: centralised cryptocurrency is not safe.  Cryptocurrencies being trustless is not just a feature, it's a necessity.

So that when dealing with with non-theft transactions all participants can do those trades without the intervention of a third party.  i.e. it cuts the stock markets out of the loop.
I want to buy X units of stock from you; we just trade, we don't register with brokers, we don't pay them commission, we just do it.  Now if it turns out that those X units of stock were stolen, then the company backing them can simply say "they were stolen" and issue some more.  At which point I would value what you're offering me considerably less, and might get a court involved to redress the situation.

That's always been possible if not likely. Bitcoin taught us how to make cryptocurrencies.

It should tend toward being just a tiny bit below the market price.  The latency between price changes and mining difficulty, and the ability to bring large data centers on and offline make it more complicated than that -- but as a rule of thumb you can say that that's where it's heading.  A long-term stable bitcoin price would result in a long-term stable difficulty and long-term stable cost-of-mining (assuming no advances in mining technology, and no change of block reward).
@_date: 2018-06-07 09:27:00
I don't think you can necessarily conclude "more miners", it's also possible that someone has made a huge improvement in hashing technology.
For example: remember when we went from CPU mining to GPU mining?  Did the massive increase in hash rate indicate more CPU miners had entered the market?  No, it meant that CPU miners were migrating to GPU mining (or CPU miners were out-hashed by GPU miners, it makes no difference).
So... I reckon it's more likely that one big miner has made an investment in developing a faster ASIC, and it's now coming online.  If that hypothesis is true, then it doesn't mean "more miners are coming online", nor does it mean "nobody is mining Bitcoin Cash" (not that that means Bitcoin Cash is 'safe' either), because the number of miners isn't really changing, only the technology.  That will slowly disperse through the market and we'll be back were we started in terms of number of miners, but we'll be at a much higher hash rate.  That's good because Bitcoin's mining incentive is doing exactly what it should: rewarding miners for making our transactions even more secure.

You can settle any debt in Bitcoin. At the discretion of the creditor.

This is cheating.   We had two people in the economy exactly so that the changes could be clear.  Adding another is just moving the goal posts.  A message or two ago it was me (in our hypothetical) who was getting a free ride.  Once we get to the point that you accept that that wasn't the case, you've added another person who is a supposed freeloader.
When you set the price for your house to me, you do it with knowledge of the economy you're in is the point.  I agree to that price with the same knowledge.
Further, when we have more and more people who each have these coins -- which they must have earned somehow.  Then we have to accept that their contribution to where we are now has already happened and so they have earned that value increase already.  Where did this third person get 500 coins and what did they do for it?
By adding the third person you've changed my "unearned reward" from 50 goats to 33 goats.  Add a fourth and it's 25 goats.  In a large scale economy the marginal change is almost negligible.


It's not socialism at all; since you have to have earned value to participate in the economic gains.  Why has number four got no coins but every body else has?  The others earned them.  They earned them by putting value into the economy.  The economy has grown because of their effort and so they should get benefit from that in the form of more valuable currency.
This forth person is more like your freeloader -- if they have no coins then they have not contributed anything.


Absolutely -- that's my point.  The coins aren't the value, the economy is the value.  The coins represent it.  The coins you hold represent the payment you received for work that you didn't wish to liquidate instantly.  The purpose of money is move effort through time.


I don't understand what you're saying here.  Who said borrowing money for free?  Interest is charged on loans.  With an inflationary currency you have to explain why anyone lends money when it's value goes down.  With a deflationary currency you have to explain why anyone borrows money when they have to repay more than they lent.  The answers are the same regardless though:
 - Interest is the rent the lender requires for temporary use of their money.
 - Time preference is the advantage the borrower gets for paying back more than they were loaned.
Those two things are always true.  The interest rate is set in the market just like the price of anything is set -- by agreement (implicitly probably -- you wouldn't loan at a rate that doesn't earn you enough, and you wouldn't borrow if you have to pay back too much).  At present Bitcoin is _so_ inflationary, that in order to get a borrower to accept you would have to offer massive, negative, interest rates ... why would you bother?  Hence: no bitcoin-denominated loans.  Eventually that growth phase will be over and we'll have a more reasonable and stable rate of inflation/deflation.  Loans will then be denominated in BTC, regardless of it being deflationary.


I suppose I agree ... the problem is that it's literally impossible to do it that way.  The only fair way to deal with economic expansion then would be to dilute the currency to exactly match the economic expansion.  You'd give the new supply to existing holders to avoid unfairly rewarding the money printer.  But how do you do that?  How can you be so aware of every transaction in the entire economy that you know exactly the right amount to print.  And in the event of an economic contraction how would you get people to all hand over the appropriate percentage of their currency?
So; given that supply inflation is always bad because the money printer always keeps it (perhaps I'm being cynical, but I've yet to see the government that prints money and gives it out); the best method is to simply leave the currency alone and let it change value as necessary to meet demand for it.


So does interest.   It's literally exactly the same.  Interest is simply making money by taking your wealth and investing it somewhere -- putting it to work.   The same is true regardless of inflation or deflation.  You just require a different amount of interest.  Wealth is always worth more put to work than it is put under the bed.  Even when it's earning money by being under the bed because of deflation.  That means there is _always_ incentive to invest.
As for spending ... we have interest already.  You can take your money and get, say 4% on it (i.e. more than inflation).  So ... why do you buy anything?  You could forego that new car and put it in the bank.  People are therefore already "incentivised to sit on their wealth" as you put it.  So why don't they?  Why do they trade it for goods/services?  The answer is that they value the goods and services they buy more than they value the foregone interest.  Exactly as they would if the currency was deflationary.

We're now on two parallel threads, so this is going to get confusing.


No.  Only when you accepted my IOU.  That was your belief that that value would eventually arrive back in the economy.  Your belief is enough that you were willing to give up your property for it.  That faith is represented by an increase in the value of the currency.  All currencies are based on faith.  This is no different.  The only reason you are willing to accept bits of paper in exchange for your work is because you have faith that the next person will be equally as willing.  The paper isn't actually _worth_ anything.


How is that different from inflation: when money constantly decreases in value, people holding debt profit from productive work?
You keep saying that "People. Will. Revolt", but it's simply not true.  The only thing that makes a currency deflate in this way is those very same people.  The only difference between inflation and deflation is who it is that gets the benefit of the increased value economy.  Why should it be liability holders rather than asset holders?  One is not any more deserving than the other.
You seem to think holding money makes you a freeloader -- money is simply a deferred reward -- if I hold money then the effort has already been put in.   When you go to work, you accept money in exchange.  At that moment your money would be worth X.  With an inflationary currency, if you choose not to spend that money straight away, then when you do spend it it's worth 0.99X (or whatever) -- your work has been devalued ... that doesn't seem "fair" either -- why should you be taking a pay cut because you were prudent?
As I keep saying: inflation and deflation are the same because every transaction has two sides.  The difference is that deflation comes from a good economic source (at least in the way we're talking here) and inflation comes from a bad source (a third party stealing wealth).


Not my favourite economist, but he had this absolutely nailed.  Here's another from another from someone else:


If currency inflation came from the same source as currency deflation would: as an adjustment to economic wealth changes -- then I would have no problem with it.  That's not where it comes from though.  We have had an ever growing economy for hundreds of years, and yet our currency has got less and less valuable.  _Someone_ got the benefit of that.  It wasn't us.
@_date: 2019-06-19 09:02:06
Well strictly I get value because I had 500 coins worth of stake in the economy -- I must have gotten that value from somewhere; most likely by doing work in the past.  Let's say it was for hollowing out the cave ... well in that case, you have been living in my cave while you built your houses.  Perhaps it was letting you share in the food that my goat represents that gave you energy enough to work?   Perhaps it was effort that my great-granfather put in years ago to save your father from drowning?  I've got the coins though -- and they represent past effort.  In essence: you couldn't have built your house without my 500 coins worth of value that I demonstrably put into our economy at some point in the past.  We are all standing on the shoulders of the past.  The wealth we hold is a measure of that.  Now we can continue getting more and more complex examples, but in the end it will all resolve to effort getting poured into the representative currency.
Remember as well your two houses are worth nothing until you sell them.  Since I'm the only other person in this economy, then we will need to price find for the houses -- how much are you going to ask me for?  Probably enough to take my "unearned" wealth from me.
However, your example demonstrates that you object to someone who didn't do any work getting a share of that created value.  In your example you object to me getting it because I didn't do any work -- but in an inflationary world _you_ still don't get the value from the economy increase, the coin minter does.  So why is that better?

The hashes can be calculated in advance offline, then they only need to compare the transactions that are incoming from the Bitcoin network with those pre-calculated hashes.  In fact, it can probably be done with nothing more than a bitcoin node and a wallet populated with those weak keys -- bitcoin has to do all this work already and has lots of people who've worked to make it fast.  The sweep could probably be done with RPCs.

That wasn't what you said though.


When actually your complaint is nothing to do with measuring it in terms of another currency (now).  Now your complaint is about it being volatile rather than "making it" volatile.
You can measure the buying power of a currency in terms of anything you can buy with it.  Bitcoin is volatile at present (as are many currencies around the world), so it's reasonable to measure it in terms of something that is more stable -- happens to be dollars right now.  That doesn't do dollars or bitcoin a disservice, nor does doing so turn either of them into a gift card.

It's the "zooming out until it shows what you want" that's the cherry picking. Is it the same at 6M on the same data set? 2M? 1M?  If it's not then the conclusion is only valid because of the scale of the chart. Cherry picking.
Additionally, the feature we're interested in is smaller scale than the chosen zoom. Is it possible to have a 6M bear market? I think yes. So why not a 6M candle? Is it possible to have a 2M bear market? I'd say just about. So then 2M would be a perfectly reasonable, and appropriate for the feature we're looking for, scale. So why choose 1Y?  Cherry picking.
It's easily done. It's doesn't make anyone evil. Confirmation bias is a very human trait. But if you're drawing conclusions from charts then the conclusion needs to be backed up by a little more than the choice of scale and/or limits on charts.

I think you've missed the potential danger of double-spends.
When bitcoiners say "double spends" we're not actually worried about money spent twice... in the end.  That's the very problem that Bitcoin solves so brilliantly.
No, the worry is when you accept without confirmations.  If I am a shopkeeper and I see transaction and say "well that's excellent, here is your coffee/newspaper/Ferrari", and transaction was broadcast at the same time spending the same coins, there is a 50:50 chance that eventually the transaction I thought paid me will never be confirmed, and I'm out the money and the product.
The argument goes that it's not worth the trouble for "coffee/newspaper", but certainly would be for Ferrari.  So merchants should judge the level of risk they're willing to accept and count their Bitcoin confirmations accordingly.

But that was your choice.  You value the 500 coins at whatever you wish.  That's exactly how deflation happens.  It's not imposed upon you, it happens because millions of actors now value the coins a tiny bit more.
It simply cannot be that the population would revolt because it is they who cause deflation.  If they do not think the coin is worth more, it would not be worth more.  It's very different from inflation caused by supply inflation, which _is_ imposed.


Deflation and inflation are two sides of the same coin as far as borrowing is concerned.
Why is anyone dumb enough to _lend_ USD, which they know will be worth less when they get it back?  The answer is the interest rate compensates.   Just as it would with a deflationary currency.  I gave an example above of exactly that.  But here it is again:
 - Inflation of 2%; loaned at 5%; effective rate = 3%
 - Deflation of 2%; loaned at 1%; effective rate = 3%
The rate is market-negotiated, so the lender and borrower agree on a price _just as they do now_ -- it would simply be a different number in a deflationary world.  Loans are taken out because you value the money more _now_ than the interest+inflation costs you.  That is no different if the currency is deflationary.


By not loaning money?  Good.  Inflationary currencies encourage taking on debt.

A short does affect price (as it should, it's a way for the market to correct price signals).
You borrow an amount of the commodity, then sell it (creating downward price pressure). At some point you have to pay back that loan. If the price has dropped since you borrowed it, you can buy back cheaper and you profit, if it has increased then it costs you more to repay that loan.
Interestingly though, a short has to be bought back, so all the downward pressure created when the short starts is undone when it ends.

No, potential for profit is why they put half a billion dollars in.  The savings bitcoin users have made is why they expect more customers to appear.  VC investors don't care that bitcoin users have saved/made money -- what they care about is that if the rest of the world finds out about the saved 5 million, there is a distinct possiblility that established bitcoin companies (established with the help of some VC money) will make pant-wetting amounts of money.

Bitcoin will only make you rich once (if at all) as it goes from zero to currency.  Afterwards I don't think it should be treated as an investment.  Most of your argument is about this initial formation phase -- I don't think it's "fair" as such, but it's a necessity since a new currency can't simply jump out of thin air at it's appropriate final value.  Price-finding has to take place.  Particularly with a private currency.   So be it though, if you have foresight to see which new currency will be "the one", then just as having foresight to see which new stocks (for example) are going to be successful, then there is a reward for that.  The key thing is "if BOMB became a global universal currency" -- "if" indeed.  I don't think discussion of the growth phase is particularly relevant to functionality as a currency though.  That growth is separate from deflation/inflation in the economy.
However to address your (fairly common argument) that a deflationary currency is only held, never spent:
 - "Daddy, I'm hungry.  Can we go and buy some bread?"
 - "I'm afraid not little one; because we'll be able to buy more bread tomorrow with the same money".
 - "But I'm hungry now"
People cannot prefer to go hungry instead of buy food _forever_.  But that's just the most extreme of examples. Deflation/inflation rates just change your time preference for money.  At some point you value the thing you want more than net future value of the money you hold; at that point you make the exchange.  So, provided the rate of inflation/deflation is constant, the economy finds the appropriate balance.  Money is only valuable because it represents the ability to spend in the future.


That might be true -- I don't agree personally -- but your argument applies equally to fiat.  The money printing that goes on means it's constantly devalued.  You need only check the history of any fiat currency to see that.
In fact, I believe deflationary currency is the more appropriate representation.  Currency exists to represent all the value in the economy.  Every year the economy has generated more wealth -- that generated wealth owes a portion of its creation to every actor in that economy.  A small deflation of your held assets is a fair reward for your part in that.  The money growth didn't happen at anyone's expense, it grows because of the wealth created by the work done by each actor.
Here's the example I like to use: imagine you are a painter, and I am a fence builder.  We are neighbours.  Let's say we represent the entire economy and we each own 500 coins.   I want my house painted -- you charge me 100 coins.  You want a fence built.  I charge you 100 coins.  Everyone has exactly the money they had to start with; but the economy as a whole is better off by one painted house, and one built fence, but there are still only 1000 in it.  Those thousand coins _must_ be worth more.  And who should get that value?  The person who mints coins or the people who performed the work?
If the coin minter gets the value (by minting more coins to cover the value of the painted house and new fence, devaluing the 1000 coins we hold back to their original, or worse, value) then he gets to spend that new money.  Hardly seems right, he did nothing.  But that is exactly what happens in our inflationary fiat world.
If no new coins are minted, then that increased value in the economy goes to us who did the work.  Seems much fairer.
As for loans: neither inflation or deflation makes much difference on the whole provided it is known and constant.  Money invested is simply invested at an interest rate which includes knowledge of the inflation/deflation rate.  So in an deflationary world, the lender knows that if he charges 0% on a loan, his money will still be worth a little bit more when he gets it back (let's say deflation of 2%).  He might therefore ask for an additional 3% ... i.e. a rate of 1%.  In an inflationary world he knows his money would be worth less (let's say inflation of 2%), but he still wants an additional 3% earnings.  He'll therefore charge 5%.  The borrower is in the same effective position either way in terms of the value that he must return to the lender.

But they'll do the hard work of making the UX for going from fiat to crypto easy. Banks will not close your account because you're doing "drug deals and child porn money laundering", you're just sending money to Facebook.
Then, assuming facebucks have a tiny bit of utility, decentralised cryptocurency exchanges can accept deposits. That removes the hardest part of decentralised exchange implementation... Fiat gateway.
If facebucks aren't useful then things carry on as they are now because no one will care about them anyway. It'll be like Reddit gold.
Hence: the cryptocurrency community needn't worry about facebucks.  They're either nothing, or they're useful to us.  However useful they are though, they are unlikely to be a true cryptocurency along with all the utility that goes with that. So they end up as a simple fiat gateway, nothing more.

They're not making enough to cover the massive investment they've had.  Certainly not enough to cover the orders-of-magnitude profits that VC investors expect a winning investment to return.  Marginal profit is not the same as net profit.  Those investors want their capital back plus more in the end.
Edit: additionally, you're ignoring that these things are all interconnected.  The bitcoin companies aren't directly buying bitcoin and hoping to moon; but they only become big enough (i.e. there are plenty of customers for their services) if bitcoin gains a larger market; and if bitcoin has a larger market it _must_ have a higher price.  So -- their plan is indirectly: buy bitcoin (company) and hope bitcoin moons.

To add to this:
People sometimes know when financial events are coming. That means that the event gets priced in before the event happens. Here that means we actually expect the price bump from the halving to be prior to the halving. Going by the (anecdotal/weak) evidence from the previous halving, that happens on the scale of about a year before.
In other words, we kind of expect (and it's all very vague I know) price to start going upward around now.
Take it all with a pinch of salt of course.

If they target 2% inflation and the yield is 2.061% then all you're actually earning is the 0.061%.
100 years @ 0.061% = 6%
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is not suffering inflation (or at least it's inflation is rapidly becoming negligible, and it's at a rate that is slower than it's actual growth, so we can ignore it).
That means even if it didn't grow (or fall) in adoption at all it would only be worse than your treasury over 100 years by 6%.
However, more likely (under the assumption of success) is that the underlying economy would grow, making Bitcoin deflationary. So you'd get the deflation as your interest in the form of a more valuable coin.  In short: a fixed balance of Bitcoin will be worth more in 100 years (assuming its success), a fixed value of USD well be worth significantly less, a fixed value of USD treasuries will be worth a meagre 6% more.

Good idea actually.
Although it doesn't directly solve their current problem. The Chinese aren't going to send a load of cash over just because Greece adopts their currency. And shortage of cash is Greece's immediate problem.
As far as I can see, their only option is indeed to default on the debt and start printing their own currency. They will then suffer the massive devaluation that is due them. At that point they'll be in a position to start rebuilding. 
Devaluation is inevitable, because it has effectively already happened by reason of them running up the national credit card for years. A new currency doesn't pay that bill. Devaluation pays it by (sadly) taking from all Greeks with the inflation stealth tax.

Note: I'm just answering your question as is; I don't think this is how it will really go for Bitcoin -- Bitcoin growth will be dominated by network effects.  Any currency's utility comes _massively_ from the size of its userbase.
So: assume a closed island with static population.  Imagine though that there are enough to participate in a varied economy; and that there are no other currencies (this is just to simplify things so we have our closed bitcoiner world for analysis, it's not a requirement in the real world though).  This economy owns an amount of "stuff" from their past work, and as gifts from nature (say like land) -- all that stuff is what we'll call "wealth", this is real, tangible, useful stuff, not just bits of paper with numbers on them or even cryptographically secure numbers.
Let's start with bitcoin being worth nothing; but with all its current utility -- low transfer fees, decentralised, easy movement, scarce (or at least fixed supply), etc -- basically the good "money" attributes.  Let's also say I've mined a few bitcoins just because I was bored one day.  You happen to be a carrot grower, and I happen to be an apple grower.  I want some carrots, but you don't like apples.  I show you how bitcoin works and offer you X bitcoins for your carrots, and just for fun, you accept.  Those bitcoins now have a market value (measured in carrots).
Over time more and more people see the utility of a money and everyone ends up using bitcoin, and a market value naturally establishes itself; everything becomes priced in bitcoins, not in barter.  This is the growing population part; and you can see how bitcoin would be worth more and more as more people were willing to accept it.  But that wasn't your question; that's just how I'm bootstrapping this environment.
Now to your question.  Everybody is now using bitcoin and it's a closed population.  How does the value of bitcoin continue to grow?  The answer is that it grows because every year this population produces more "stuff".  Houses are constructed, fields are worked, iPhones are built -- there is more "stuff" than last year, but exactly the same number of bitcoins.  Those bitcoins _must_ be worth more.
This is deflation.  It's been happening for thousands of years in the real world.  It's just been hidden from us all because of the inflation created by governments.  The natural state of an economy is deflationary -- that is to say, everyone gets wealthier (not necessarily by the same amount) every year because more has (net) been produced each year.  Money is simply a convenient proxy for wealth -- it should _always_ gain value.
Your question then should really be: why haven't I been getting richer for all these years.  The answer is: you didn't have a reliable currency (or even the option of one).  You do now.

So your argument is that my deflationary currency (meaning that it increases in value) has decreased in value?  And the fact that it's worth more... sorry less ... sorry more ... is what makes it non-viable as a currency?
How's that work?
Your IOU example:
 - I buy your house with debt.  Worth 100 goats.  Our ledger therefore says "you: 100 goats; me: -100 goats"  net goats: 0.
 - I pay back the debt by supplying you with goats.  Reducing my debt, but also adding net goats to the economy.
 - Eventually I have supplied 100 goats worth of effort into the economy.  Matching the value of your house.  Ledger says you 100 goats; me 0 goats"
 - The economy is now richer by 100 goats.
So it turns out those 1000 coins in the economy _did_ represent more value.  And I had to earn the value that I gained in my 500 coins because they are deflationary.  There was no free value given to me.


That _is_ how fiat works.  In _addition_ to the treasury creating money by printing it or by quantitative easing it into existence, it can indeed be created by banks creating debt.  That is not the M0 supply though -- and is a much more complicated discussion than we are having.  We're talking about fiat as compared to bitcoin, which means comparing the M0 supplies of both.  The M1, M2, M3, etc would have parallels for both currencies so can be disregarded when comparing qualities of the base money.  IOUs are further down the chain than M0.  IOUs denominated in either BTC or USD are perfectly possible.  Debts also cancel out (because they are an asset to one, and liability to another) so the positive and negative don't affect the wealth in the economy anyway, so IOUs created as you describe are neither inflationary or deflationary.
None of the debt-money creation denies the fact that governments print money.  You don't honestly think they don't?

Don't confuse options like Coinbase with centralisation; in a decentralised system (like bitcoin), all options are possible.  Offering a centralised service on top of the decentralised service adds value (for exactly the reasons you list in your post).
It's analogous with the way git is a decentralised version control system; and yet GitHub is an excellent centralised service.  On the day GitHub annoy me, I'm not tied to them in any way, my source and its history can go somewhere else -- even (and this is the key bit) to my own self-hosted equivalent.
Similarly, on the day Coinbase annoy you, you can go to any of its competitors, or even (and this is the key bit) to my own self-hosted equivalent.  Bitcoin being decentralised is what lets us have many independent competitors who need no permission from the existing players to join in (compare that with how hard it would be to [start your own bank and join the existing big-boys club](

Except the schedule isn't "completely changed". We're near the end of the majority of issuance anyway, steps are being taken to address the bumpy block rate, and the bumps are averaging out to give a similar block rate anyway. It's only 9500 blocks ahead of Bitcoin. Which isn't many in the grand scheme, certainly not enough to make any significant difference to inflation.
And after all that there will still only be 21M coins... Which is what matters regardless of whether you think differently.

No, it's not.
The UTXO set is a different thing, and is those transactions that have been mined into blocks, but have yet to be spent.
The mempool is those transactions not yet mined, but pending and valid (validity established in no small way by testing if they spend an output from the UTXO pool).
In short: the UTXO pool can be reconstructed from the blockchain.  The mempool only exists in memory (well, potentially wherever the miner wants to keep it, so not just memory, but it's a good name for it) and cannot be reconstructed from the blockchain.  Each miner's mempool is potentially different.  Each miner's UTXO is (in theory) identical.

I certainly don't mean you're not serious.  And it's hard not to sound overly aggressive on the internet when writing in text.  I'm just talking, please don't take use of "disingenuous" to be offensive personally, I'm describing an argument not a person.
I used the word "disingenous" for two reasons:
 - It's perfectly clear there can be adverts for Bitcoin.  It doesn't need to be a company or a product for that to be so.  There were, for example, adverts advising people about avoiding bird flu, when that was all the rage.  Bird flu isn't a product or a company.  That doesn't mean those adverts had no copyright.
 - Bitcoin is _manifestly_ a competitor to PayPal.  In fact, if it weren't then why would this even be a parody?  Swapping a BMW for a lasagne is a reasonable "they aren't competitors" statement; but the fact that the Bitcoin community is so keen on jumping on a PayPal advert, is so keen on PayPal's stance towards Bitcoin tells you that these are not completely unrelated technologies.
Both of these are pretty apparent, and so I think it is "not ingenuous" to pretend that they aren't so. 


Again I say "disinegenous".  You are surely aware that Bitcoin is not just a one-for-one analogy of a dollar?  Dollars, Euros, Pounds, Rubles, Shillings, whatever, are indeed all currencies.  Bitcoin is (we hope) a currency.  But "Bitcoin" isn't just the unit of account on the blockchain, it's the Bitcoin network, it's the blockchain _itself_.  You can't just pretend those other facilities exist.  PayPal can be used to transfer value from person to person on the Internet.  Bitcoin can be used to transfer value from person to person on the Internet.  They are competitors.


Why would that be unreasonable?  They are competitors in the "means of transportation" space.  Now, I'll grant you, I don't like Ford's chances, but if Teleporters Inc. simply copied one of Ford's adverts it would _still_ be copyright theft.

Bitcoin doesn't have to be another company or product (even though claiming it isn't is highly disingenuous -- are you saying there can't be a genuine Bitcoin advert?) It's not a parody just because you change the name in an advert or because you disagree with the copy writer's slogan.

For reference:
 - One transaction per day in each of these stores would 260,000 transactions per day.
 - Transactions are mined into blocks at an average of 3 transactions per second (given the block rate and block size, and typical transaction size).
 - 260,000 transactions @ 3tps will therefore take 86666 seconds to clear. 
 - There are, coincidentally, 86400 seconds per day.
In other words, at one transaction per store per day _all_ of Bitcoin's transactional bandwidth will be used up -- that's with no other transactions happening, and assuming that those transactions happen evenly spread over a day.

In a sense I suppose, since wealth is simply the integral over all transactions; but really they are securing all the previous transactions.  The wealth could be secured right now by programming every client with the hash of the current longest chain and never adding another block, never calculating another hash -- everyone's current balance would be completely secure... but worth nothing.
The "wealth" of bitcoin, given that it has no non-monetary utility, is 100% tied up in its utility for transferring value.  If the transactions stop, the value of bitcoin is zero.
I suspect I'm splitting hairs really, but I do believe it's important to view the value of bitcoin in terms of transactions.

A couple of points:
 - The costs should be measured as a function of moved money, not market cap.  The miners are securing transactions, not wealth.
 - If I have 100,000 BTC; the mining cost for me to send it to you is exactly the same as if I have 1 BTC and want to send it to you.  The bytes don't care how big the number they represent is.  Ten bytes is ten bytes.

Of course they land every which way.  Did you miss where I said exactly that?


I was using a ball to demonstrate that "past behaviour doesn't predict future behaviour" is not an absolute truth.  Then observing that past behaviour is _all_ that we ever have to go on for predicting the future.
Now anyone who tells you that those predictions are guaranteed true is a liar -- but anyone who tells you those predictions are guaranteed false is a liar too.  The world is not black and white; and it's not crazy to use the past performance of a "speculative asset" to try to put some guess on what it will do in the future as long as you put an estimate of likelihood against it too.  The point of the gravity example is that the liklihood is 99.9999999999% that it'll be the same -- I'm certainly not saying that the four previous big bubble cycles we've had in bitcoin mean that it's 99.999999999999% certain that it will happen again.  But it's not 0% either.
And in fact; if we go by the past -- after the third collapse there were those saying exactly as you do now "speculative asset. past doesn't predict the future".  There was no guarantee they were wrong at the time; but actually, since we've now had a fourth bubble and collapse _they were wrong_.
Now -- I am not offering any prediction at all -- what I'm trying to do is point out how foolish bifurcated thinking is _in either direction_; and that someone who thinks there is a greater than 50% probability that it'll be the same this time as last time is not being foolish.

Fascist-rCanada got down voted for sayin that people paying the 1.5% are doing something illegal (which is definitely nonsense).
However, his other point is reasonable: as a first-order protection, personally  I simply want to protect myself from the loss of privacy that is caused by the blockchain (as an example, what if I had two donate signatures on a "HotAsians" forum and on a "GodIsMyHero" forum; I want to be able to combine the funds from both of those google-able addresses without revealing that they are both the same person to anyone that can use google and blockexplorer).  An exchange will enable that without the 1.5% fee.
To be honest; for 1.5% I'd want a bit more from blockchain.info -- help doing the above.  I should be able to say "I have three source of funds that I want to anonymise ... sort it out".  At the moment, I'd have to go through the anonymise system three times manually to three different target addresses, then (probably) pay the output of those three to a fourth.  Can't the system do all that for me?  That would be worth the 1.5%.

Since I was using "ball comes down" as the prediction; I don't think the spinning or blindfold makes the slightest bit of difference.

I think you're being particularly dismissive.  That was an impressive demonstration and warning from Loss of privacy is not an all-or-nothing; it's a matter of degrees.  There is a difference between knowing some random bitcoin address and suddenly knowing all that extra stuff that he posted.
As he pointed out; law enforcement would have more options as well.  But even without that -- if the above analysis were done automatically and available everywhere, suddenly every place where that user had used that email address has got more information about them -- maybe that gives them IP addresses, other emails, forum posts, potential passwords to try.
It's certainly not something that I'd dismiss as quickly as you have.
You also miss the point about pseudo-anonymity.  You have to bear in mind that all identities are essentially equal -- you think you have a "real" one by convention, but that's only convention, it's no more real than any other identity you create, and the more actions you take with one of the others, the more that one itself becomes "you".  For example; I could have a hundred bank accounts in the name of "Carlos the Jackal" -- then I could buy an apartment in that name with those funds.  Now I've got money and an address with loads of cash ... do I care that it's not under my "real" name, when the CIA stake out the apartment and confiscate my money?

If I transferred some money from a savings account to my current account before putting some of that in my wallet and buying drugs while carrying my wallet, can they take all my savings account too?
If I sold some of my stocks to fill my savings account to transfer to my current account and put some of that in my wallet and bought drugs while carrying that wallet, can they confiscate all my stocks?
IANAL and I know governments can go wild as they wish; but this sounds so extreme that I'm not sure it's so.

Adoption and price go together for a fixed supply currency. The network effect is what gives value in that case, and adoption increases the network effect.
I specifically then said "if Bitcoin gets mainstream adoption" it'll follow the standard curve. So I'm certainly not saying that's a guarantee. And failures to meet user requirements (by becoming too expensive) could certainly be one train for failure.

If you're being really paranoid, even that isn't enough.  Nothing stops an attacker putting a whole duplicate CPU core and exposing its JTAG to you.  Then you'd have to reprogram it and see if what you expected to be running was actually running.
Even then ... what if you replaced the CPU core with one that had a back-doored hardware RNG?  Then, even if you are running the 100% genuine firmware... you're still screwed.
... and the world wonders why people keen on open hardware are so weird about being able to see inside their gadgets.

Adoption curves are typically sigmoidal, the "s-curve", in the first half they exponentially increase, in the second the slow exponentially.
No guarantees of course, but exponential is not unreasonable as a first guess. If you think it's going to be adopted mainstream, it'll probably follow that curve.

Deflationary currencies don't, within reason (just like inflationary currencies) affect loans.
Inflationary currency, let's say 2%, and a loan with nominal 5% interest -- remembering that this is set by a competing market.  That means the actual interest paid is 3%.
Deflationary currency, let's say -2%, and a loan with nominal 1% interest -- remembering that this is set by a competing market.  That means the actual interest paid is 3%.
The market will set its rates with knowledge of inflation/deflation built in -- it will therefore move to the same actual interest rate.
The only thing required for this is a stable rate.  Bitcoin's supply curve is pre-programmed.  You don't get more stable than that.

Past behaviour absolutely is a predictor of future behaviour.

Past behaviour is all we have as input to our prediction engines. In anything other than maths there is no way to guarantee that next time gravity won't work differently until you throw the ball and see. However, if you're playing the odds, then a bet on the ball coming down again is perfectly reasonable. And posts like this containing only factual data are just input. You can conclude what you wish from it.
Just as... We've seen bitcoin do this multiple times before. There's no particular environmental differences this time, so there's no reason to think this time will be different.

No it isn't. At least relative to virtual items (which is what the poster you were replying to was comparing against).
In the time it would take you to wrap up your physical gold for transport, someone else can do a thousand virtual transactions.
To be really secure you have to physically attend a gold exchange. I can use escrow services to securely transact in Bitcoin.
Confirming the authenticity of gold requires an assayer. Confirming the authenticity of a Bitcoin requires a standard mobile phone.
Selling a fraction of your gold requires weighing scales and incredibly precise cutting tools. Virtual currencies are just numbers on a computer, divisible to the current implementation accuracy without any special effort.
I'd go as far as saying that there is probably no commodity that is harder to sell than gold.
I think only counting "finding a buyer" in your measure of difficulty. As you're a trader, you obviously find that easy. Now take a non trader.. How easy would I find it to find a buyer for my physical gold? It's real easy for me to find a buyer of cryptocurrencies.

I don't understand your what if. What if? No difference. Why would that be a problem? That's a bank offering a service. You can accept it or not at your option. You aren't forced to use the bank though. You can keep your money on your phone.
Exchanges already offer the service you describe. It's fine. Each of us decides whether to accept the interest in trade for the counter party risk. Banks would have to compete. They would have to show they were keeping your deposit safe. They would have to demonstrate they weren't indulging in frb. All because you no longer literally need them. Flat playing fields produce competition which results in quality for the consumer. Rigged systems (like the special rules banks currently operate under) result in the consumer getting screwed.

You've not addressed many of my points.  Are you accepting those others?


That may all be true.  But that wasn't the debate.


Bitcoin _is_ easier to sell.  The fact that a local coin shop would buy an ounce or two of gold from me isn't relevant, the fact is a bitcoin exchange will buy my bitcoin from me without me leaving my desk.  If I so desire I could sell millions of dollars worth.
Also: I don't know where you're based, but "local coin shop" is not a thing in the UK, there aren't many people who would live close enough to make that a journey one would classify as "easily sell gold".


So I just send my gold bar in the post to them do I?  I was hoping "securely" was a given in this debate.  I can send Bitcoin in small amounts to an exchange, having divided them as I choose.  So I've never got much at risk at once.  You can't just chop a bit off your physical gold.  Then: when your physical gold reaches this online dealer -- what if they write back and say "this is fake gold that you sent"; how will you prove that they are lying?  How will you be sure that what you get back is real gold?
I'm not saying gold is useless; or that Bitcoin/Crypto is going going to obsolete it completely.  But if you're arguing that gold is as easy to deal/transact with then you've got goldbug blinders on.
@_date: 2019-01-24 08:56:23
Of course I would. As I say you can get that deal from exchanges right now and yet people (me included) recommend you keep your coins under your control. An IOU for your coins is not the same as your coins.
I actually think you're missing the point. I did not say that no one would use a bank. I said the important thing is that they could choose not to use a bank. That has some important knock on effects.
Now personally, if I had one million coins I think I would be more worried about counter party risk than if I had a tenth of a coin. The important point is that that bank would have to offer a very sweet deal to buy that risk; each of us would have his price. That is as it should be.
My point is that that is not how it is with fiat. Fiat banks do not offer you very much at all because they know you cannot do without them. Result: 0.2% interest on your fiat deposits. What do you imagine the interest rate offered for a cryptocurrency deposit would be? Higher or lower?

I suppose it could, but I can't see that that is the more likely outcome.
The total value of the currency must be enough to service all the users of it. Therefore as the number of users goes up, the price must go up to. If we assume that on average a user is a similar unit, that the ones at the beginning of adoption have no needs that are particularly different from the latter ones, then adoption and price will be in proportion since users 1-1000 bring the same financial needs as users 1000001 to 1001000.
There are certainly other possibilities, but they make more complex assumptions, and so in the absence of a good reason for those complexities, I'll stick with occum's razor.

Again you miss the point.  The choices are:
 - Buy Bitcoin _now_, with dollars
 - Buy Bitcoin _now_, with electricity, which you buy with dollars.  We call this "mining".
It doesn't matter what Bitcoin is worth in the future since they're common in both scenarios, but in the second you get _fewer_ Bitcoins for the same dollar cost.  In fact, if mining is _unprofitable_ (rather than just less profitable) you will actually be forced to dip into other capital (i.e. sell your Bitcoins) to keep the system operational.
I'm not measuring gain tomorrow so I'm not "conclude[ing] that the cost of electricity today will negate gain tomorrow", I'm measuring gain _now_ (or 2013 if you like) and measuring it Bitcoins.

You're still describing gains/losses from the investment that is the purchased Bitcoins.  You can't do that, because the comparison for mining profitability is at the instant of mining, could you have gained more coins by taking the money you spent on mining and just buying coins?
It really doesn't matter whether it's a bear market or a bull market since I'm comparing mining vs buying profitability in Bitcoin, not in dollars.


No it's not.  The price of bitcoin goes, up, the difficulty goes up and so the same amount of electricity buys you fewer bitcoins, just as the same amount of dollars would buy you fewer bitcoins.


Not so.  Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm makes it a guarantee that the average marginal cost of mining one coin equals the price of one coin.


Why?  Bitcoin's price is nothing to do with the miners.  Do you think the price follows difficulty?  That's manifestly untrue -- if it weren't then miners would always be incentivised to throw more and more hash power at the network since the increased difficulty would drag the price up.  Obviously that's not so.  The miners are only able to get the current market price for any coin they mine.


If they're holding coins they're not.  They've paid for those coins with electricity which they paid for with dollars, non-miners have paid for coins with dollars.  From then on the two are equal.
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:47:47
Then you haven't understood the calculation.
If you're relying on the growth of Bitcoin for your mining profits (when mining isn't directly paying for itself), then you might as well take the money that you would have spent on equipment and electricity at the time and bought Bitcoin's directly.
The point is, that "Don't mine it's going to be negated by cost of electricity" means you will have _more_ Bitcoins if you just buy them.  So those 2013 naysayers were right and are still right -- for the vast majority, mining is not profitable in itself.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:47:49
I didn't say you could buy without using electricity. I asked about quantities. Your argument is that mining is a more cost effective way of obtaining Bitcoins than buying. Which you're saying is true because you need electricity for both. But electricity is quantifiable.
1 kWh is not equal to 100 kWh.
If it cost me 0.1 of a kWh to purchase a Bitcoin on an exchange that's not the same as using 1000 kWh to mine a Bitcoin just because both "used electricity".

Plus, let's say the bet is "&gt;421k in ten years", and in ten years the price is $420,999?  AWWWW, TOO BAD LOSER.

@_date: 2017-10-25 14:44:09
I'm sorry, but that is nonsense. Mining certainly isn't "fool proof".  
The "investment" is the purchase of Bitcoins.  It really doesn't matter whether you buy them with USD or with electricity (which cost you the same number of USD).
If you buy them with electricity what matters is whether the number of bitcoins you get is higher or lower than if you had bought them directly.  If it's lower, then mining isn't profitable.


There are two costs to being a miner:
 - Capital costs: purchase of mining hardware, maybe office space to store it if you're big enough
 - Marginal costs: the cost of running the mining hardware.
If you're running a properly costed business, you should be including capital costs when you work out whether you are in profit or not.  However, since you're allowed to spread them over time and we might assume that they will be small relative to the marginal costs, I'm perfectly willing to ignore them.
That leaves marginal costs.  Let's say it costs you $5000 of electricity to mine one bitcoin in a day.  You must cover that cost with the income from your business.  If the one bitcoin you mined can be sold for $5500, you have made a $500 profit.  If it can be sold for $4500 you have made a $500 loss.
The economics of mining is such that the situation described above wouldn't last long.  That happens because if you could make a guaranteed $500 per day, then new miners would say "why don't I jump on this bandwagon?", start up their own hardware and hence increase the difficulty.  Tomorrow it costs $5500 to mine a bitcoin in a day.  Alternatively, if a miner loses $500 every day that they leave their equipment powered, they run to the outlet and turn it all off.
If the marginal profit from mining is zero (and it is) and you're keeping your mined Bitcoins; then all you've done is find a complicated way of buying Bitcoins by buying electricity first.  Why didn't you just cut out the middle man and buy them directly?
There is a proviso.  Difficulty takes a little bit of time to adjust, and in general Bitcoin prices have been going up.  That means there are always new miners, that basically means that difficulty has always (on average through Bitcoin's life) been playing catch-up.  That "catch-up" is where miners are earning a little bit of non-zero marginal profit.  That lasts until Bitcoin's price stabilises.  It also represents a slight miner discount for the Bitcoins they are purchasing with electricity over buyers who are using exchanges.  They basically get to buy bitcoins at the price they were at the previous difficulty adjustment time.  I would imagine though that that is outweighed by Bitcoin's natural price volatility.  If you happened to buy your Bitcoins on an exchange on a day when the price was a little lower then you've just gotten that miner discount by luck.
That leaves only the capital costs to consider.  Even though I ignored them as negligible, they're not when there is no marginal profit -- they're the entire net cost. The capital costs are included in overall profit calculations but are not included in the decision to turn the miner on.  This is because the capital costs are sunk costs; they exist whether the miner is powered or not.  If there is any marginal profit to be had, then the miner will run the hardware they've already bought.  This has an unfortunate knock on effect.  The difficulty adjusts to make mining zero-marginally-profitable.  That guarantees that capital costs are therefore not covered on average.
Things are never so simple of course -- some miners are more efficient than others; some have access to cheaper electricity; some will suffer accidents; some will be bad businessmen; some will think that "everything is money once you pass ROI" and will irrationally mine regardless of the long-term loss.  Those all mean that some miners will be profitable and will cover their capital costs and some won't.  But it is a _zero sum game_ for miners: every winner will have an equal and opposite loser.  We'll also see mining gravitate to the places that get very good at (a) designing and building more efficient mining hardware quickest (b) have the cheapest electricity (c) have the smallest capital costs.  What a surprise, (a) (b) and (c) are all "China" and China is where all the mining is happening.
However, mark my words: you can't beat economics.  Slowly the same forces that have moved mining to China will start eating at individual Chinese miners.  Maybe South China miners will get cheaper electricity because there is more Sun available for Solar power.  Maybe coastal China miners will get hit with a hurricane.  It doesn't matter, the market forces (and the clever design of Bitcoin) eventually catch up and every miner will make just enough profit to keep the lights on.  They will then look around on that day and think _if only I'd taken all the capital I used to build this factory, design and manufacturer all these ASICs, pay my staff, drive to work every day, and pay my ISP bill and just bought Bitcoin with it.  I'd be up 10000% and wouldn't have had to get out of bed._

We could debate that of course, but that's a separate question.
The claim was




And "it would make it possible to DoS a node" is not a demonstration that ASIC resistance is impossible.
There are other things that could be done if we were seriously considering this (as I said, I don't think it's possible for Bitcoin to practically make a PoW change, so I'm certainly not seriously considering it) -- if a node were getting DoS attacked, it could simply drop the connection that's doing it.  We can reasonably assume that the network isn't producing blocks at a high rate continuously -- so no need to put up with getting thousands of blocks a second if you're a node.
This form of DoS is _already_ possible anyway.  Every transaction a node receives has to be validated ... nothing stops a malicious node sending invalid transactions to make exactly the same attack you describe.  Why is that one not a deal breaker, but my ASCI-resistant hash method would be?

It's also silly to ignore the profit motive.  It isn't evil; it's what's going to drive bitcoin's success.

Agreed.  I'm certainly not saying he's correct.  Anyone with the slightest economic incling should be able to see that the first application of any blockchain technology has to be a value token.  That the two are inseparable (unless you don't care about your blockchain being utterly compromised).
In fact, that's kind of my point, it's _so_ obvious, that there has to be some other factor that prevents these economically literate people from seeing it.  That something is the weight of their own previous incorrect opinions.  I think it's a psychological thing more than an intelligence thing.

The more profitable rationality is, the more rational people become.
Pricing in a reward-halving event that is guaranteed to be coming is about as profitable and rational as it gets.
What's going to happen then?  Well, very little.  Halving only directly affects the miners.  The miners have already bought their equipment, and they bought it knowing the halving was coming, and will have priced that in to their calculations.  There is no point turning off their mining equipment until the reward actually halves.  And even then it will only be profitable to turn off already-bought equipment if the marginal cost of mining a block is greater than the value of the reward in the block.  I suspect capital costs will be more significant in the short term, so we'll see switch-offs happening slowly rather than suddenly.
As to effect on bitcoin price, well, unless you think the majority of the bitcoins for sale are newly mined coins (you only need to look at volumes to see that isn't so), the price will barely alter.
As evidence: the last halving was a complete non-event.

Quantum computing will therefore make bitcoin more deflationary.
Probably because the blockchain will need to pick a date and obsolete unmoved coins.
Alternatively, the quantum computer owner will be able to steal unmoved coins that are probably "lost". But here's the thing, that movement will have to be to a new quantum resistant address. In which case that theft can only happen once and can only happen to lost coins. There can still only be 21M coins, and normal users will go on as they did before.

The global black market is tiny in relative terms, so surely better to get the white market on board first?
One might even argue that that is the far more sensible thing to do politically.  If OpenBazzar is not safe for illegal products yet, then only the legal will use it -- it therefore can't be tarnished with the "everything on there is kiddie porn and drugs" straw man, since that won't be true.

Given that banks have converted themselves into a necessity in the modern world -- yes, they should be forced to do business. (That's before we even consider their unique ability to create money).
They can put whatever conditions they want on the account (no loans, debit facilities only, no card services), but given the protections (and money) they get from the public, they are effectively a public service.  It's nigh-on impossible to run a business without a bank account to put your income into and make expenditures from.  Until bitcoin changes that, banks have a special position in the world.

I think they should be compelled because they aren't operating in a free market; they are quasi-governmental.  When they aren't, they can do what they like for exactly the reasons you say.
What I say is not hypocritical -- it is the banks that are hypocritical.  They want all the protections of being a governmental department, but want to shout "free market, free market, private company" when it comes to choosing who they do business with.
When anyone can run a bank without permission, we'll start treating them as a private company that can pick and choose it's customers.

The thing is, that manipulation is only possible because the size of Bitcoin markets is so small.  It's also debatable whether that manipulation is even a bad thing -- they still have to stump up the cash to do it.
So you're right that decentralisation doesn't hinder manipulation.  It does hinder corruption though -- there is no way for the operators to collude, unlike with existing financial markets.  The problem with corruption is that it let's you use priviliged position instead of money for manipulation.  _That's_ the problem; manipulation should cost you actual cash (like everything else in a market) not ephermeral "reputation" when you get caught.

When you are backpedalling, you don't instantly end up back at the top of the river.  You've got to travel the distance in the opposite direction.  It's harder too, because humans don't like being wrong, and their brains would rather alter reality (or rather their perceptions/memories of it) than admit being wrong.  That means backpedalling is necessarily mentally upstream.

With Bitcoin, security and value go hand in hand -- the more valuable bitcoin is, the more the block reward is worth.  The more the block reward is worth, the more miners there are that can pay to run their operations from that reward.  The more miners there are, the more secure the blockchain.
Value is the incentive to secure.  The genius of Bitcoin is that it creates exactly that incentive: a reward for securing the network.

 - "Whales throwing their weight around": why shouldn't they?

Just like [Trading Places]( early access to information -- the problem is not the money, it's the positions of (centralised) power.
It's important to note though that you're still not really talking about decentralised Bitcoin; you're talking about centralised exchanges.  The problems you mention aren't solved by regulation -- we know that because exactly those same problems exist in the non-bitcoin world.  LIBOR manipulation, banks laundering money -- they all still go on, and yet they work in the most regulated industry in the world.

"Legal tender" is misused a lot around here.  It means one thing only: that "legal tender" cannot be refused by a creditor for settlement of a debt.  It specifically doesn't mean that you _must_ accept it for your goods.  If I don't want to break your $100 when you want a newspaper -- the dollar being legal tender does not force me to; but it would force me to accept (in the sense that a court will not rule in my favour) your dollars to pay your newspaper bill at the end of the week.
This is to protect you from, say, a creditor refusing to accept payment in dollars, but instead demanding you settle the debt to them in the form of pictures of your wife in a French maid's outfit.
Bitcoin does not need to worry about that whatsoever at this stage; and being declared a legal tender would add only the tiniest extra feature to Bitcoin's stack.

I've never seen that as a huge issue. Provided you can change Bitcoin for their toilet paper, you can pay your tax. If the government are the only ones using toilet paper, well it won't be worth much, and there'll be plenty of places to get it (mostly government contractors who want rid).

Easier fix for the current "double spend is easy" non issue:
Change Bitcoin to propagate the first double spend attempt as well as the first seen transaction. Then everybody knows that a double spend was attempted near instantly.
Besides "easy" simply isn't true. You have to maintain wide network connection and perfectly time the release of your double spend transactions. And you have to risk that the honest transaction gets mined. And you have to hope that the merchant is watching the half of the network that saw the honest transaction. None of that is "easy". You also have to do it while face to face with the merchant.
With rbf, you just walk out the store, then push a button on your standard wallet to release the dishonest transaction. Now that is easy.
Who cares though? This is opt in for the receiver, there is no incentive for them to opt in. Unless they want to enable easy stealing from them. Enabling it by default seems a bit crazy, as the default would be that the opt in receiver will refuse the default opt out transmitter.

Money is generated when it's generated. Printing a note of fiat "generates" money.
It doesn't generate value though. The act of generating money in this way actually causes inflation, in that all the previously printed units are worth slightly less value.
Bitcoin, like all money, _represents_ value it doesn't _generate_ value. The work we all do in the economy generates value. We transfer some of that to our money by using it. Simply by trusting that $10 buys you $10 worth of goods or services gives it that value when you accept it in exchange for value you have provided to someone else. Same with Bitcoin.
Now, bitcoin's advantage is that its creation is governed by an algorithm, not by the whims of a central bank controlled by a government. It is like an even stronger gold standard because there might always be a hidden supply of gold not yet found, that is impossible with Bitcoin, it's supply is fixed.
The math problems are solved as a way of locking-in the ledger at regular intervals. This means if you want to change the past (like reversing a transaction) you have to do more computational work than was done by the Bitcoin network did to create that "lock-in"; and you have to do it all on your own. That's not practical, so doesn't happen, and hence the Bitcoin ledger is essentially written in stone.
The actual math being done... You don't care. What is important is that it's the sort of problem that is hard to solve but easy to verify. That is to say that you do not have to repeat the work to see that an answer is the right one. This is what makes "why don't we do SETI or folding work?" suggestions invalid. Because the check for correctness by the rest of us would require us to redo all the work -- which is impossible.  The analogy I like for proof-of-work systems is finding a piece of a jigsaw ... finding the piece is hard (you have to search a large number of pieces), verifying a piece is the "correct" one is trivial (you just try it out).  Every bitcoin block is a new jigsaw, with a new box of pieces.
Edit: grammar.

Yeah, but my logic was that it is the wallets that will inevitably make themselves blind to RBF transactions, for exactly the reasons you give: RBF is a minefield for those that don't understand, so "default off" is the most user friendly option.  Wallet authors aren't stupid, so that's what they'll pick.
Also, you can't have it both ways: either people don't understand RBF (in which case they'll accept whatever they're sent, and most of the time will be fine), or they will, and will happily call out the $11 note.


I agree completely that there are going to be fuck ups; but they are such visible fuck ups that they will get fixed quickly and we'll move on.  Remember, my core point is that RBF isn't the end of the world for bitcoin-in-retail as seems to be a common thought -- it's an annoyance for most that is going to be routed around rapidly.  I don't know why it was rushed/pushed in, I don't know why now is the time felt that this was needed, but unlike blocksize limits or not -- it's just not a big deal, Bitcoin is not going to stand or fall based on it.  Now, if it hadn't been opt-in, we might have something to worry about -- but it is, so we don't.

Why?  You reverse it then send a non-reversible transaction.  There is also the social embarassment of having even attempted to pay for something with the "I'm going to steal from you" flag set.

It's obvious that it's being done with fiat -- you don't need a blockchain.
Hasn't stopped them doing it.


Absolutely agree; but I don't see what about Bitcoin would suddenly educate those same people about debt-based money creation.  If average Joe's current account was denominated in bitcoin, why would he suddenly know what a scam banking is?
As for being able to "tell the difference" -- I'm not sure you've appreciated how it would work.  Bitcoin on the blockchain is the equivalent of USD cash in your pocket.  For a short while, that "cash" is not in the banking system and so is not amplified up.  Eventually though, you spend it, and it is deposited back in a bank.  At any time there will be X% of money in pockets, and 100-X% of money in banks; and that second pot can be amplified up with IOUs.  Bitcoin would not change that.
What Bitcoin does change is the size of X% -- most of what you need a bank for when we're talking fiat, you don't need them for with Bitcoin.
Remember, all I was addressing was the idea that money creation by banks would be impossible in a bitcoin world -- that simply isn't true.  It might happen less, but it will definitely be possible.

The point is not that it's possible -- it is.  But possible and easy are not the same thing.  "public tools available" is not the same as "easy", after all, a compiler is a public tool.  Also, double spend only works in places where we're talking zero-conf -- so generally mobile -- are these tools built into a mobile wallet?
If I am widely connected to the bitcoin network, then I'll see your honest transaction and the double spend.  Whatever tool you use, you'll have to get those transactions out simultaneously -- ideally you'll want half the network to see one, and half to see the other.  Which means _I'll_ see both, and I'll see both fast.  Which in turn means I'll refuse to accept your double spend.
Mycellium, Coinbase, Blockchain.info, Bitpay, will all take on this labour for you (and I'm sure others).  So; these public tools that make it easy ... let's see you use them practically to actually perform a double spend attack where you walk away with goods you subsequently don't pay for.  If it were truly as "easy" as you say, there would be a lot more theft going on than there is.
@_date: 2015-03-18 11:06:41


No they didn't say that.  Not even a little bit.
They said you no longer need (as in, have no option but to have) a trusted third party.  You are now directly responsible for the trust you put in the person you are sending money to.
Bitcoiners also provided a convenient facility for building in a trusted-third-party should you want one back -- multi-sig escrow.  Again: it's your responsibility to decide if you would like to make use of those facilities.
(Incidentally, if bitcoiners thought "trust" wasn't necessary, why was a multi-sig feature ever coded?)
@_date: 2015-11-05 14:37:48


That's not how banks create money.  It's created as debt.  Let's say you do a job for me, and I don't pay you.  But I owe you, so I give you an IOU for 1 bitcoin.  If you can persuade enough people that that IOU is from a reliable source, it's as good as 1 bitcoin, but it's not (and can't be for the reasons you obviously understand).  So that's one extra bitcoin's worth of value circulating in the economy.  All that was necessary was the "If you can persuade enough people that that IOU is from a reliable source," not the ability to create blockchain tokens -- and banks have historically been very good at that.  Even today, in the world that hates bankers, you will still be asked "but what is bitcoin backed by?" as if fiat is backed by anything other than wishful thinking.
That, in essence, is what bank balances are, and it doesn't matter what the denomination is, nor does it require that that the IOUs aren't on a blockchain.


Average Joe will still trust the banks though, and doesn't have any idea that the dollars in his account are different.


You're right about no private keys; but why would it only be redeemable at the specific bank that issued it?  It's a number in a computer, and the existing inter-bank settlement systems would just as easily settle bitcoin balances as USD, GBP, EUR, or anything else.


Why would he catch on?  He hasn't for fiat, what would make him suddenly gain all this understanding because bitcoin exists?  "regular money" would be the balance in his account.  Governments could "FDIC-insure" bitcoins as easily as they do fiat, giving it all that veneer of respectability that Average Joe likes.


Well then we're are entirely in agreement.  As I said, I was objecting to the statement that it was impossible with bitcoin, and already acknowledged that it would probably be reduced.

It's nothing to do with being mined.  Bitcoin operates a "first seen" policy for entry into the mempool.  If the first transaction is already in the mempool, the second will be rejected.  Transaction propagation time is less than 10 seconds typically, and once your first transaction is in every miner's mempool, the second will be rejected and so cannot ever get into any block, regardless of when it's mined.
The post you link to is mostly about why opt-in RBF doesn't make things any worse -- I'm entirely in agreement with that, and has been my point in most of my posts.  This fuss about RBF is over nothing -- where it makes things worse, RBF transactions won't be accepted.  Fine.  We can move on from that.
The rest of it is a bit wild for me.  That post also says:


Which cannot possibly be true.  Why would the network 100% accept the dishonest transaction over the honest?  The network doesn't even know which is the honest one.  Worst case is 50% success.


Why would they need to retry if it's a 100% success rate?
It sounds like we're talking about online services -- who should know far better than to credit accounts for zero-conf -- or at they very least shouldn't let you withdraw or use that value until one confirmation.


How is this possible?  The way a double spend works is that your victim sees the honest transaction, and then later your dishonest transaction gets mined.  That means the honest transaction _has_ to be broadcast widely, even though the attacker doesn't want that.  The attacker then wants to get his dishonest transaction most likely to be mined -- that means he needs it in mempools, so it has to go in before the honest transaction makes it in.  He wants his dishonest transaction broadcast as widely as possible, so how can he prevent the victim seeing it too?  The only possibility there is that you have a miner helping you -- but even if that's so, it's certainly not widespread, and since there is no 51% miner, your risk of dishonest-transaction-not-mined is ever lower than the 50% you'd get with public broadcast.  And miner's have no particular incentive to help you commit fraud other than the greater fee they might earn mining the dishonest transaction (which is essentially RBF).
Unless I massively misunderstand how double spend works (which, I grant is perfectly possible); I simply can't accept that it's being done undetectably and at 100% success rate.

Then all the users of bitcoin would be blind to transactions on their blocks. Making a huge opportunity for one honest miner to make a killing.
Remember miners get to pick which transactions are in blocks, but every single wallet gets to chose for itself if those blocks are valid. Mining alone is not enough to make my wallet "see" the 25btc reward - I have to agree the validity of it. And if I don't then you can't send your reward to me, so you can't spend it, so it wasn't worth anything.
Conclusion: miners will be very careful with what block rules they chose to apply their mining power to under the fear that they spend that effort making invalid and hence unspendable block rewards.

Legal tender laws are about debt settlement. They pose no threat or advantage to Bitcoin. Forget about them.
They are there to protect debtors from creditors who decide they won't accept debt repayment in money but want to take it in nude photos of your wife. If you pay them in legal tender anyway the law considers it settled.
These laws do not force anyone to accept fiat though for anything that isn't a debt repayment, but you can refuse a trade because you don't like dollars without problem.  If Bitcoin were out-of-the-blue made legal tender it _would not mean_ that you could make any retailer take your bitcoin.

I don't know; and I have the same "oo-err" feeling as yourself when trying to explain the discounts on purse.io.  However:
 - There are buyers with long histories -- I've had the same buyer buy for me on occasions separated by six months.  If these are CC fraudsters why haven't amazon shut them down?
 - Purse.io is a very good way of turning Amazon gift cards back into cash.  So when Granny gives you £100 worth of vouchers for Christmas, you can get £80-90 worth of ready bitcoins back in your hand.  So your "I've got a credit-card and want to pay extra" isn't the likely use case.  Plus -- in the UK at least, getting bitcoins is not easy.  Localbitcoins is a bit scary because they're strangers; so credit-card to Amazon probably feels a lot safer to those who don't buy their BTC in bulk (like I do, and hence get to use Purse.io to get a discount).
 - Purse has been going for some time now.  I was, like you, expecting some sort of massive blowback.  It hasn't appeared.  At least for sellers.  Maybe the other shoe will drop one day.  But we're measuring in years now -- which gives me a little confidence to carry on using it.
 - I have a friend who's put considerably more through Purse than I have... Big computing purchases rather than the few books and games that I do.  He's also not had any blowback.

Can't be enough to make a difference.
Transactions must propagate the whole network.  If they didn't then your (perfectly ordinary) transactions would only appear in a block when that part of the network mined -- the don't -- they appear in the next block, regardless of who mines (for the most part -- there are a few weird miners).  Given that -- how does any relay policy know that a transaction it receives will later have a conflicting transaction (i.e. a double spend)?  It doesn't.  So the only propagation rule that can possibly be affecting this is "do I propagate a transaction that conflicts with one I've already seen?" (i.e. only the second transaction can be conditionally routed).  The answer, at present, is "no" -- and then you get the detectable double spend I've described.

That only works if you stop the wash trades when you start your real buying.  That the volume has increased implies that that isn't what's happening.
And in the end, you can't fake the price.  Wash trades result in zero price movement; so no matter how much you try to obscure things with washes, the price will rise when you buy -- supply and demand can't be faked, and hence price can't be faked (assuming the exchanges aren't literally manufacturing figures, but in that case, you don't need washes or even any traders -- you just publish the fiction you want, so this whole discussion would be moot).

Double spend without rbf is hard, not guaranteed to be successful, and detectable within the network propagation time (seconds).
Double spend with rbf is easy, guaranteed, and undetectable until the next block has been mined.
They are nowhere near the same.
That being said... It's not a big deal. Every wallet will disable reporting of zero conf rbf transactions for the user's safety. So if you want to pay for a coffee you'll have to turn rbf off in your sent transaction anyway. This is all a lot of noise about a waste of everyone's time not about the Bitcoin apocalypse.

They can send you anything they want.  They can send you half the value you asked for.  That doesn't mean you have to accept it -- _that_ is the ultimate "opt-in".


"Exception handle"?  That's a bit of a fancy phrase for "you haven't paid me, try again".
If I'm a merchant and you send me an RBF transaction, I'll say "sorry, no RBF for zero-conf transactions", then you'll use RBF to return that transaction to yourself and send me a transaction I can trust.
It's about as complex as "sorry, you accidentally gave me a $10 note, when you meant to give me a $20 note".


I understand that the first time anyone goes through this in a retail situation is the last time they will want to go through it -- provided RBF is a switch you can throw in your wallet (send or receive), which way would you set that setting from then on (assuming you are honest and don't have any desire to double spend)?  Knowing that, as a wallet author -- which way would you set your defaults?  Send RBF by default?  Accept zero-conf RBF by default?

Since there is no way to know what transactions will be made, and the "calculation" being done is the hash of the block, there is no way to know in advance what calculation will be done.
For example: if you wanted to abuse the bitcoin network's computing power to, say, break a password hash, then you might carefully craft a transaction that the network would work on hashing that wouldn't be a payment in reality, but the hashing of it matched up with your nefarious task (although crafting that would be a non-trivial job in itself I think).  Then some yahoo comes along and buys a coffee just after you've submitted your carefully crafted transaction and completely blows the utility of any answer.
Worse: the next block hash is dependent on the previous block -- so that coffee has blown your chance of appropriating that hashing power not just for this block, but for every subsequent block as well. And there's more people buying gum, transfering money, paying bar bills, all intefering with your beautifully crafted transaction.
In short: nah.  And: a computing teacher has all the knowledge they need to understand bitcoin.  It's only complicated to Joe-public; to someone familiar, and happy, with hashing, it's actually pretty simple to understand.  That, in fact, is what makes Bitcoin such a fabulous creation: like many great ideas, it's obvious once you've been told how it works.

Goldman Sachs (who wrote the report) obviously haven't spent the 5 minutes they should have researching what they're writing about.


... But since Chinese exchanges have zero fees, that number is meaningless.
Even if it weren't, there is no way to know that it's only Chinese trading on those exchanges.
Even if there were, since every buy is a sell, there is no way to conclude that the Chinese "can't get enough" since the exchange data tells us that as many who want bitcoin, don't want bitcoin (hence they're selling).
The measure of demand outstripping supply is price increases, and there is no evidence that Chinese exchanges are some huge source of demand that the rest of the world is suppressing with arbitrage.
In short: what a load of tosh from Goldman Sachs. Do they get paid for writing such shit? Are the rest of their "reports" of similar quality? Someone should be suing them if so.

Their unnecessarily invasive KYC and AML policies mean this is inevitable.  As time goes on, it will become more so.  Not because KYC and AML will lessen, but because given the choice between Slovenian unknowns wanting copies of your passport and some regulated NYSE or NASDAQ traded company wanting copies of your passport; your average conservative citizen is going to pick the big name.
Combined with the evidence that hacks of exchanges are perfectly possible, I think it's incredibly dangerous to hand over the crown jewels of your government-issued identity documents to anyone.  Letting someone keep a scan of your passport -- using who knows what security, with only their promise that they are safe (is that like the promise that they won't get money stolen from them) -- seems, to me, incredibly short-sighted.
I'd also add that Bitstamp, while they were No.1, were fairly arrogant about demanding those documents, and only shouted "it's the law, it's the law", when of course, there is no such law -- since I have managed to open multiple bank accounts with no such documentation.

I think this is a difficult number to find for bitcoin. Correlation is statistical, so needs data. In the case of Bitcoin though, it's a moving target. If anything it's going to get more correlated over time as it gains acceptance. However early on it will have literally zero correlation.
That means your beta parameter is, until Bitcoin reaches its final stable state in the world, is time changing. I.e. you almost certainly haven't got it's current or future value as of now. I'd even argue that it's simply not possible to calculate it now.
Now... What we actually want, in truth, is not anticorrelation, it's uncorrelation. So your beta being near zero is probably a good thing.

True; but they're very small relative to credit card fees.  I'll grant you though -- it's not showing signs of improving at present, but I think market pressures will fix that soon enough.


Doesn't matter who nominally pays them.  That fee makes the product more expensive.  It doesn't need evidence -- it's self-evident -- suppliers aren't in the business of charity.  If you lower their costs, they can lower their prices.


As I argued in another comment -- this makes supplier reputation important.  Remember, nothing stops a supplier screwing you over in a miriad of ways, with or without credit cards.  Reputation is important.




Why is that bad for the consumer?  What advantage does a bank account give me that isn't to do with electronic money transfer?


Perhaps it's different in the US, but in the UK, yes you do.  There are poor rip-offs of debit cards (electron, and the like) but many places do not accept them.  I have no idea why this is so, but it is so.


What conversion?  I have Bitcoins, supplier wants Bitcoins, there is no conversion.  Perhaps you mean the original cost of purchasing Bitcoins?  It's my experience that purchase of Bitcoin has close to zero exchange rate losses.  I can, for example, buy Bitcoin using my UK debit card from Circle and I get _exactly_ the amount I'd expect given the USD/GBP and GBP/BTC rates at that moment.
On the other hand, if I transfer GBP to Kraken (EUR) via the banking system I pay an international transfer fee, and I get an absolute rip-off of an exchange rate.


Are you saying that identity theft isn't a thing?  Because it is; and those who suffer it get scant relief from the "fraud protection" their card provides.


Seriously?  You think theft is okay because you've got insurance?
It sounds like you're just really anti-Bitcoin.  That's fine -- I'm not suggesting you have any of your current mechanisms taken from you.

Only one I think, the rest are all buyer-side.  Could you say which of the others you think are supplier-side benefits?
The one that is supplier-side is, I think, indirectly a benefit for markets as a whole: you want a world where the supplier reputation is more valuable than the buyer reputation.  Models like ebay/PayPal, where you unquestioningly side with the buyer and do a chargeback means that the buyer reputation has relevance -- but it's easy to ditch your identity and start a new account when you're a buyer, since you don't care about repeat business.  That means there is incentive for buyers to cheat.  With no-chargebacks, there is no facility for buyers to cheat, and so their reputation is unimportant, and the supplier reputation is everything.

The coins are lost. Their value is distributed (by the forces of economics) amongst the remaining coins. Bitcoin being highly divisible means that there "being less in circulation" is irrelevant, the number 21 million was pretty much arbitrary anyway and Bitcoin will find its correct value based entirely on the number in circulation.
Hence, nobody is in the slightest bit worried about helping recover lost coins, in the same way they're not worried about helping recover dollars that you dropped in a blender.

For someone that actually wants bitcoin at the cheapest they can get, a Willy-like bot would serve an honorable and valuable purpose.
"Price manipulation" is not something to worry about when the manipulator has to pay money to do it -- you pay your money and take your chance.  So the only manipulation we should worry about is by the exchanges themselves.  Regular audits would be good; but really the only way we can be sure they aren't fractional-reserving, front running or cross-trading on another exchange using information from their own is to get rid of them... So again, we should factor that into our own trading choices -- we pay our money and take our chance.

You probably need the power of multiple states to compel the reveal of identifying information.

The thing is; at the bottom of a bear market, any purchase between the peak and there looks bad...  That's not a good measure though -- you're analysing a period which is pretty much a straight line between the highest ever price and the lowest price following it... there is no profitable time.
However, that was true after the previous peak too and exactly the "buy the dip" mockery would have been appropriate then too.  Except time passed and a new peak appeared; and what looked like awful trades during that downward slope all look amazing during the next downward slope.
Now ... I'm certainly not saying that guarantees that that's what's going to happen -- I have no special knowledge.  But whining during  downward price slopes that "buy the dip" is stupid advice is itself pretty naive.  The past tells us that sometimes that advice is correct -- and has a better track record than "you're all going to get burned, stay away".
So no guarantees; but "buy the dip" is more sensible than "buy the peak".

It's up to you how much you value those individual items as a consumer (I value my privacy and security a lot), and that will be an individual thing.  I think it's a bit of a generalisation to say that those things won't matter to people unfamiliar with Bitcoin -- if that's so, why do card companies offer fraud protection, favourable exchange rates, and loyalty bonuses (which are effectively them giving some of their fees back to you)?
You've accepted that the second is potentially valuable to the consumer anyway.

Shares can't, strictly, be divided.  But if you were a company that wanted to offer that facility to your customers, it wouldn't be hard to do -- since all you need to do is find ten customers who all want part of a share, then you buy the whole share yourself and deal with the split (and dividend payouts) in your systems instead of in the stock exchange systems.
But the actual "owner" of the share is the share dealing company, since there can be only one.
If it were the general case that you could own part of a share, then stock splits would never be necessary.

 - No chargebacks for the supplier (you might consider that bad, but actually it forces suppliers to value their reputation, and for customers to research reputation).
 - No fees (which are rolled up into goods, so you get stuff cheaper)
 - Privacy -- I don't have to tell the supplier anything about myself.  Just like with cash.
 - No need for a bank.  You'll need one of these to settle the credit/debit card bill.
 - No need to be 18.
 - Works internationally, with no exchange rate that favours the card company
 - Identity theft -- everything you need to spend on your credit card is printed, in plain text, on the card.  It's then, for the most part, stored on every suppliers database where it is easily stolen along with your billing address.
 - Credit cards being "pull" payments means that that information can be used to steal your money.  Bitcoin is a push payment system -- you send it; they don't take it.

Anyone who's doing anything in bitcoin where the accuracy matters with floating point is making a huge mistake right now, regardless of whether my suggestion were implemented (which I have no illusions it would be, it requires time travel).
Floating point numbers are utterly unreliable for accuracy, regardless of whether 2^50.9 is the size of the mantissa.  There's a reason the bitcoin protocol uses a 64-bit integers and never floats.  ([rant about this very subject from bitcointalk](

Fractional reserve isn't actually the evil... Well it is, but it is symptom more than disease. The disease is that banks that indulge in fractional reserve don't pay the price when that misbehaviour goes wrong. The central bank bails them out by simply temporarily printing and loaning them all they need to ride out the bank run. Moral hazard.
Fractional reserve in the Bitcoin world had the distinct advantage that there is no lender of last resort and no printing to bail out the organisation that does it. That means the "bank" (it more likely the exchange) has disincentive to indulge and more importantly, the clients have incentive to demand that their service providers do not do it. After all, it's their money that is actually at risk.

Pegged currencies are just proxies, so we can ignore them and talk about the currency they proxy.
Governments can move their currency value relatively, so I was arguably not precise enough. The worth is set by the market like everything else in the world. Your dollar isn't worth some government defined basket of goods, the market sets the price  and says this is how much currency I require for my good.
I think you've confused cause and effect, the government doesn't manipulate the price, the price changes because they manipulate the supply.  There is nothing a government can do to stop everyone raising their prices in response to their funny games with printing presses. Try as they might when they print it it's worth less. Governments don't want the money to devalue, if they printed more and it was with the same they would be delighted.

In theory practice and theory are identical.
In practice, Bitcoin doesn't go from a million dollars cap to a hundred million dollars without new capital flowing in. I'll grant it doesn't have to be, and probably isn't, 99 million. But it's not an insignificant amount. Additionally, it's not just miners that matter, it's all existing holders. For what you describe to happen, the entire Bitcoin for sale supply has to vanish. If you genuinely think that's what's happening, please say so... That would be "interesting".
Regardless... That really wasn't the point I was making, was it?  I was saying that scale matters. And it does. 500% profit on a dollar is not the same as 500% profit on a million dollars.

Hypothetical scenario: tomorrow it's announced that SHA-256 has been broken.  It is trivially easy to create a message with an arbitrarily chosen hash.  Bitcoin's entire security system is worthless, and nefarious types start transferring all the extant coins to themselves.
Now the whole world would start selling them, the price would fall rapidly, and we have a world where you lost 100% of your money that you invested in bitcoins.
This scenario is completely made up, but you get the idea.  The early adopters would have completely lost their money, while the rest of the world just stood by and laughed.
This, and many other, disastrous scenarios are just as possible (if not more so) than your instant "reserve currency".  The risk that the early adopters are taking is why they would reap large rewards in the event of massive success.
That success, should it happen, will not happen without the early adopters leaving their money where it is.  There is nothing stopping anyone from taking that same risk right now.  "unfair" seems the wrong word.

Quiteright.  I assumed the government still exists and still wants to take the exact same amount of money to fritter away on nothings.  I'm really only comparing in "all other things being equal" mode.

Their two examples both say "if you've earned income you owe tax", which I think we already knew.  What they don't recognise is that "watching" bitcoin doesn't inform the IRS that either of their two example events have taken place.  When Bill buys one of Carol's T-Shirts for 0.05BTC, there is nothing to indicate to the IRS that that is any different from when Bill transfers 0.05BTC to another of his own addresses, or transfers it as a gift to one of his children, or indeed to indicate in any way that Bill specifically did anything.

Grab yourself a root file explorer and poke around. Under block chain's file directory are copies of the encrypted wallet.
Even if that weren't so, we're talking about the wallet password, locally stored, being encrypted by the pin not the wallet. If it's as you say and the pin is going via the internet, that isn't a good thing. It's just reduced the attack space from a large secure password to a little pin. Part of block chain's appeal is that the wallet is secure even if it's stolen from a hacker with web site access. Not so much if they only have pins to break.

For now this is entirely correct -- of course it is; how could it be any other way?  Our fiat currencies are the basis for our current notions of price.
That doesn't mean it will always be so.  If people grow to trust bitcoin, and bitcoin becomes more and more successful (big ifs), then the prices of things in bitcoin will be more stable than the prices of things in fiat.  At that point, people will start to use bitcoin as their basis for price understanding.  _Then_ uBTC, mBTC, et al will become useful.

Of course it will be stable.  If bitcoins were, right now, valued at $1000, think how much money you would have to dump in it to move the market price.
Look at the FOREX markets, they are "stable" to a degree that is acceptable to most users of those currencies.  They are stable because of their staggering market caps (not their price).  If Bitcoin gets to a sufficiently high market cap, it will be just as stable.

The scenario is presumably: somebody else deposits to my bitstamp account.  To prevent this, they want to be sure I own both.  To do that they ask for my passport.  How do they know that the passport I show them is mine?
All that matters (or rather, all that can be known) is that they have a trail to track the money back to its source account -- and they already can do that.  I would understand more if they said "you can only transfer money in from five pre-defined bank accounts, and you must supply those details 30 days in advance".

Absolutely.  I heard (I think on reddit) a few weeks ago an excellent way of describing bitcoin's current state.
Bearing in mind that there are only 21 million bitcoins total... 
 - If you own one, you are guaranteed to be at least one of the richest 21 million bitcoiners on the planet (of 7 billion people, that puts you in the top 0.3%).
 - If you own ten bitcoins you are in at least the top 0.03% richest bitcoiners on the planet
 - If you own one hundred you are in at least the top 0.003% richest bitcoiners on the planet
At present, maybe it doesn't matter much if you are a rich bitcoiner (the vast majority of people own zero bitcoins, so it's not that hard).  Imagine though that bitcoin becomes large enough to be on the world stage, that say oil starts getting priced in bitcoins.
I don't know about you, but I'd like to be in the top 0.3% of richest dollar owners.  Hell, the top 5% would do me very nicely.  To be in the top 5% of bitcoin owners on the planet, I only need 0.006 BTC.

Nah -- not mathematically.  Just in v1 of the protocol.  Which has a fairly silly blunder in it:
The 'value' field for bitcoin transactions is 64 bits.  Defined to be in units of 10^-8 bitcoins.  This was daft.  2^64 divided by 10^8 tells us the maximum number of whole bitcoins we can store in this value field... 184,467,440,737; 184 _billion_.  But wait; only 21 million bitcoins are ever going to be mined.  The protocol enforces that.  Therefore even if one person were to gain every single bitcoin ever mined, and move all of them at once, there would still be wasted resolution in this field.  log10(2^64 / (21E6)) is 11.9; which we would have to round down to 11.  The value field should therefore, for maximum resolution, have been specified to store in 10^-11 bitcoins.  In other words, three decimal places of accuracy have been wasted.
That problem could be fixed, and we'd get another 3 decimal places in the same number of bytes; or more sensibly, another few bytes added to the value field.  Or even more sensibly: use of the variable sized fields that are all over the place in the bitcoin protocol, _except_ in the value field :-)
In short: it's a problem that will get solved if it needs to be.  For now, 8 decimal places of division is what is stored, not what is mathematically capped (there is no mathematical cap).

All currencies are a bubble -- they are bits of paper, not of any particular utility in and of themselves.  Even gold is just a lump of a slightly attractive metal.  What gives all of them value is trust -- trust that tomorrow some other schmuck will accept them in exchange for goods or services, and that they will do so because they trust that they'll be able to do the same.  Bitcoin's been running for 8 years now, with broadly nothing but growth.  Every day that Bitcoin doesn't collapse in a heap that means that that trust grows stronger. 
Whether Bitcoin is "the one" or not doesn't matter -- cryptocurrencies as a whole are all undergoing the same process and one will emerge as the winner.   Unlike tulip bulbs.

PIN protection?
Depends how it's done.  I've already got AppLock protecting access to blockchain, so if that's all it adds it's not sufficient.
The big weakness is that the wallet password is/was stored unencrypted; making any malicious attack app that can get passed the (fairly unreliable) protections that Android/Linux puts in capable of stealing your wallet and decrypting it (a second password on your wallet helped protect against this).
Further, even if the PIN is now being used to encrypt the wallet password, it's still going to be trivial for an attacker who's copied the blockchain data directory to brute force by trying all of the 1000000 combinations of even a six digit PIN.
The most secure it will get (and even then, we'd worry about keyloggers) is a full password-encrypted wallet.
Personally, I've concluded that blockchain-on-android is not secure enough, so I've moved all but the most trivial amount out of my blockchain wallet and into an electrum wallet (regularly backed up, although that's supposedly unnecessary for electrum if you have the seed key) on my desktop.

That makes no difference; my example was about transaction rate.  Please give an example of what you mean with some numbers if I'm not understanding properly.
The comment you linked to is incorrect.  As [this comment]( points out.
It's a pretty significant "wording mistake" to confuse "number of" with "rate of".  Anyway, I'm happy now that it wasn't that I'd misunderstood.  We all seem to be on the same page.  Blockchain size is proportional to transaction number; blockchain growth is proportional to transaction growth.  There is no quadratic.

Bitcoin _is_ working.  So that's that one knocked on the head.
Bitcoin the system, bitcoin the protocol are all functioning perfectly.  Transfers work, mining works, confirmations work, the network is maintaining itself.  Bitcoin the infrastructure, then, has absolutely no problems (that need concern us users).
What you are talking about is front ends, user interfaces and services... the beauty of bitcoin is that all of those can be (and are being) provided by third parties.  Competition in that market will be (and is) fierce.  Competition means it will sort itself out, don't worry.
The final problem: who will accept it.  Who knows?  That is an entirely social question.  I believe so, but belief is hardly probative.
@_date: 2013-04-02 11:35:44
It's the decentralisation that's the key.  I'm a realist -- I accept that bitcoin might fail, a lot needs to go right for it to become part of our culture.  But that is exactly what the potential is -- think about how much the Internet was part of your life in 1995.  It wasn't.  Now it undoubtedly is.  Bitcoin has potential for that level of societal shift.
You're looking for efficiency in the wrong places.  You have to consider that 3.5 billion people (that's 50% of the world) has no access to any kind of financial service.  Those of us that do are purchasing from companies that might have profit margins in the 3% range -- exactly the same as the payment system take.  That means the potential is for businesses to double their profits without changing the prices one bit.
That frees more capital (either on the consumer or supplier side), and capital investment is what causes productivity increase, which in turn is what causes economic growth.
Bitcoin economic growth is different though -- because it's not racing against someone printing money, and hence keeping all the benefits (and then some) of economic growth for themselves, then we, the hoi-polloi, get an easier life next year than this year.  The benefits of growth accrue to society.
Perhaps you're right -- I am being overly grand and optimistic -- but those are certainly possibilities that make bitcoin so much more than "just another form of payment".
 - "more expensive than cash"?  Nonsense.  I can't send cash to Amazon; if I could I would have to go and get it from the bank, which would take me time at the very least.
 - "almost instantaneous but so are credit card and paypal".  No, they are instant to authorise, but take considerably longer to transfer.  The comparable metric for Bitcoin is the time taken for a transaction to propagate through the network (which is seconds).
 - "And we experience few percet effieciency increases almost yearly".  No, we experience a few percent of inflation yearly.  That is, effectively, not growth from our point of view.

Where did that idea come from?  Maybe the Liberty Dollars thing?  But Liberty dollars were shut down because he was (a) calling them "dollars" (b) making them use the same style as dollars (c) telling people to pass them off as dollars.
Alternative currencies definitely aren't illegal: if they were, then facebook credits, amazon gift cards, linden dollars, and mikey mouse money (or whatever disney calls them) would all be illegal.


That at least is true.  However, that's hardly going to matter to wall-street types.  They're not going to invest in something that's illegal just because there is no practical way to catch the criminals.

That's not how it goes.
You are always measuring the value of the thing you might buy against the future value of the thing you hold.  When you value the thing you are buying more highly, then you buy it.
Simplest example: you are hungry.  Doesn't matter that you can buy more bread tomorrow, you want to eat now.
Or: in 1000 years your deflationary currency will suddenly leap to by worth 1000x what it is now, literally that day.  Until then it's flat.  What would you care about that?  You will never see that day.
Future value is still _a_ value, and you can still weigh it against the thing you want/need to buy.  It's exactly the same calculation, it's just got a different set of coefficients/offsets with a deflationary currency.
You need only look at the technology market.  We have had, effectively, a deflationary currency for buying technology for the last 50 years.  You can buy a faster, smaller, sexier bit of technology tomorrow with less money.  And yet you don't wait, you buy anyway.
Runaway deflation is different.  Just as runaway inflation is different.  Just as deflation-because-of-recession is different again.  It's a mistake to say "deflation is bad" just because recessions often come with deflation.  It was the recession that was bad, not the deflation.

The paradox goes further...
If bitcoins are so attractive that people want to keep them; then merchants will be more incentivised to try to _obtain_ them.
In the end, (slow moving) inflation and deflation just adjust a point of balance in an economy.  The one key difference is that in an inflationary monetary system, it is the people with the printing presses who benefit from economic growth at the expensive of the savers.  In a deflationary (or stable) monetary system it is the savers who benefit from economic growth.  This is good for all of us because the incentives are in the right place (savings good, printing money out of thin air bad).

It's better to have merchants trusted because of reputation and contract law than for us all to pay 3% of (the mostly honest) total transactions turnover to the parasites at the card companies.
Buyers don't need, nor have for the most part, reputation.  There are just too many of them.  We live in a world now where it will very quickly be damaging to a business to treat customers shoddily -- word will get around.  For example, I don't need the credit card protections I am implicitly getting when I deal with, say, Amazon, who have a no-quibble return policy regardless of what my rights are.

Those aren't disputing my point: that fractional shares is a service provided by the dealer, who is willing to deal with the fractions in their own systems.  The shares actually traded are traded whole.  You can't go to a stock exchange and buy 0.5 of a share.
You can go to a broker and say "I'd like 0.5 of a share", and the broker will buy a whole share and then pair you up with someone else who wanted half a share and just perfectly forward all the dividends in proportion to each of you.  Note as well: I'm not talking about ETFs, they're different.

That's a diagonal  comparison. Unless you have Euros and pay for stuff in dollars and then covert the remainder back to Euros then it's not the same.
As for confirmation taking an hour: that is the time a payment clears. The equivalent for cc is days. The supplier let's you walk off after payment with a card after the payment has been accepted by the cc processor not when they have received the money. With bitcoin the transaction propagates around the world in less than 10 seconds. That's less time than most cc terminals take to dial their modem.

No; I'm not in denial ... You still haven't got it.
I'm not some insane bitcoin cheerleader.  I fully expected a big drop, and I fully expect another.  What I'm saying is that these curves are nonsense.  If they had any validity, then no one would ever lose on any investment ever because they are all so wonderfully predictable.
These curves pretend that they are absolutes -- they aren't.  Prices go up, prices go down.  They certainly don't do so in line with some trite little pseudo-psychological chart.
I remember the first big bitcoin drop from $30 to $2.  Every five minutes then, someone would post exactly that chart.  Where is that $1/$30/$2 on this chart if $260 is its peak?  Where is the "bear trap" in reality that this magic chart claims existed?  It's all bollocks.  Chartism is bullshit.
Saying so doesn't mean I think bitcoin cannot drop, it means I think the charts are no different from astrology, biorhythms or divining the future from some steaming entrails.
I'm also saying that _even if this chart were true for standard stocks_ (which it isn't), bitcoin doesn't fit in that model at all so it _still_ wouldn't be relevant.

It doesn't have to have literally added that amount in the time.  Merely it has to have added expectation of that value.
Markets like to predict; in theory price is the _net present value_ -- that includes future value too.  It is quite possible that in the last week, enough adoption stories appeared to represent that value.
Bitcoin is unusual in that the more successful it becomes, the more likely future success is.  It's not like a company where success means "selling more product", merely buying in is an increase of its success, since the more widely distributed the coins are, the closer it is to becoming an every day currency.  Hence (I think) we get these exponential run-ups.   Positive feedback.
Unfortunately, positive feedback is never stable and works just as well in the opposite direction.  It's all a question of whether the positive feedback gets under control before it hits the (present) limits.

They can't refund because there is no way to know where I want the change to go.  They can't access the inside of the wallet because that's encrypted -- unless they keep it unencrypted, in which case information is leaked.  They can't assume one of the input transactions should have a refund applied to it, I might be emptying one of those addresses in anticipation of deleting it.
I suppose it's possible they might collect email addresses (although that's an information leak too; my blockchain.info wallet has no information that identifies me outside of the encrypted wallet) and offer refunds on a regular basis.  But that hardly seems convenient or efficient.

You're right that shares can't be divided, but that's not a good argument for why it is so.  There's no reason (these days) why shares couldn't be divided.


The owner of the share can do what they like with it.  Do they need approval for who they sell their 10 shares to?  No.  Then why would that be different with a divisible share?  Because it would be many people?  Who cares, it's not like they get any more voting power.  In fact, the more people there are, the less likely they are to be able to stage any kind of block vote so you get less effective voting weight to the share that is divided.
Your vote multiplied by percentage of ownership is all that matters for voting.
Total dividend multiplied by percentage of ownership is all that matters for dividends.
Since percentage is infinitely divisible, there's no real reason why shares couldn't technically be infinitely divisible.  It's just that they're not.

First imagine a village with a big public ledger in the centre of the square.
Now imagine that signatures in the ledger are unforgeable and uneraseable.
Whenever anyone in the village wants to transfer value to someone else, they go to the ledger and say "I transfer 50 pfennigs of value to Harl Broompusher.  signed Fin Teatray".
Now, Harl Broompusher can look in the ledger and add up all the value previously assigned to Fin Teatray and decide if he actually has enough to make such a statement.  If so, Harl Broompusher will hand over the bag of oats (or whatever) to Fin Teatray.  Importantly, note that the signature _is already in the ledger_, so can't be undone.
Now you, essentially, understand Bitcoin.  The public ledger is called the blockchain.
How does initial value get into the ledger?  When it's empty there is nothing anyone can add up to transfer, right?  Time for another analogy.
Imagine that on each page of the public ledger is a torn off corner.  Also in the square is a cart filled with torn off bits of paper.  Gimble, Vroom and Plonk the village idiots, spend all day searching the cart for the corner that's missing.  At the end of the day, when one of them has found it, the village all gather round and let him stick the the missing corner onto the page and at the same time write "Vroom found the corner, so we give him 50 pfennigs for his trouble.  Signed, everyone".  That 50 pfennigs is not transferred from anyone, it is simply written as a credit in the ledger and is paid by devaluing everybody elses pfennigs.  Vroom can now spend that value around the village, and the process of money supply inflation begins.
The search for the missing corner, which must be an exact match is the equivalent of bitcoin mining, but instead of pages, the miners are solving blocks.  It's actually done by searching for the answer to a very hard to calculate mathematical question.  The key point about the analogy is that it's hard to find the missing corner but easy to see a given corner is the right one.  Just as it's hard to find the right answer to the mathematical question, but easy to see that a given answer is the right one.
Ta-da.  Now you understand bitcoin mining.
I'll accept that the above is not a 100% accurate analogy, and is missing out some important bitcoin features (please don't fill my inbox with "you know nothing about bitcoin" comments), but hopefully it gets you a good deal closer to the truth.

Where are you getting that fact from?
@_date: 2013-02-17 12:50:53
1. Not Backed
Nothing in the world is "backed".  There is only one thing that makes fiat currency implicitly valuable: the fact that you can pay your taxes with it.  If your government decreed that all taxes had to be paid in bottle tops, bottle tops would suddenly be valuable.
Also: nobody is required to accept government currency.  What is required is that if you want to take someone to court for non-payment, you had better be aware that the caught will treat an offer to settle the debt in legal tender as "good enough".  However, other than for settlements of debts, there is no requirement that a merchant accept any particular form of payment.  I can set up a bitcoin-only shop and not be in breach of any law.
2. No critical mass.
Well duh.  Critical mass has to arrive.  Once it does, there will be, by definition, no stopping bitcoin.  If bitcoin had reached "critical mass" then this entire article would be pointless.
3. Switching costs.
This point doesn't even make sense.  It's saying, I think, that bitcoin transactions are still taxable.  So what?  Fiat transactions are taxable.
4. There's nobody to police it.
Aceppting the police of course.  What they actually mean is that there is no state insurance of thefts from banks.  Well since I won't need a bank, and insurance companies already exist for the purposes of private insurance; I don't think that's going to be a problem long term.
Stealing bitcoins is still theft.  The thief has committed a crime _today_ with no additional laws needed.  I don't know where they get this idea that we need a special police force for bitcoins.  There is no special police force just for stolen TVs.
5. No Need.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHHHAAAAAAAAA. Tell that to any supplier who's ever been charged back unfairly.  Tell that to anyone who's tried to send money over international borders.  Tell that to anyone who's paid a premium because suppliers have to cover loss risk, and a cut to the payment processor.
How is this even a "beware" worthy point?  If there is no need, then no one will use it, right?  Why is there a risk?  Besides, it looks like people are using it, and growing in numbers.  Maybe bitcoin isn't useless after all?
6. Volatile.
Whine, whine, whine.  Volatility need not bother you if you use a payment processor who takes the volatility risk for you.  Also, volatility early on is the only way to get to stability.
7. Unfair?
WTF?  Unfair because fractional reserve banking (which benefits, primarily, the bank) isn't possible (which isn't true anyway).  You'll forgive me if I have a different measure of fairness.  One where, say, no one steals value from the currency I have chosen to store the remuneration from my work in.
Complaining about the early adopters getting rich is also not appropriate.  Without _someone_ adopting bitcoin early on, it would never be where it is now.  Those early adopters risked, and had better foresight, and like all investors, are justifiably rewarded.

Your logic is correct:


The conclusion then is that they _can_ create currency.
Neither of us has any bitcoins.  You do some work for me.  Your price is 1 BTC.
I don't have 1 BTC to pay you so I say "will you take an IOU?".  You agree.  You head off to the butcher, who knows me, and ask if you can have your month's supply of sausages.  You explain that you've not been paid yet, but you have this IOU from me, whom the butcher trusts.  "Okay", says the butcher, and hands over the sausages.
1 BTC has been spent twice, but nobody actually has any BTC.
Now imagine that the IOU is in the form of your balance at the bank account, and that it is the banks that everyone finds trustworthy enough to accept their IOUs rather than actual payment.  They all accept the bank's IOU and then deposit that IOU at another bank, and round we go again.  Now imagine that, unlike in my simplified example, no work was done to create the original debt -- the central banks issue that debt out by writing two numbers in their computer (bankA is owed eleventy-trillion dollars by us; bankA owes us eleventy-trillion dollars), and then the spending from the positive one of those two .

Fortunately, every day the governments of the world are converting the lies that are the bank balance sheets (which contain billions in overvalued toxic assets) into truths (by buying their toxic assets from them for negotiable cash).
Thanks goodness for governments, eh?  Without them, my bank's balance sheet would be terrifying.  With them, it's only the government balance sheet that's terrifying.

I'm not cherry picking. I'm using the start of this thread, which didn't mention cash.
Your experience is dependent on the particular merchant's policy. Out also sounds like you're talking about moving money rather than purchase. The site has to be a lot more careful when the thing you are buying is cash.
If I were selling you a house, do you think I would sign it over to you from a card swipe machine saying yes? The good in question and it's value are very much relevant. With bitcoin you get surety of transfer much faster for any defined level of risk. Cash is not untouchable in that regard because if you accept cash for the sale of a big ticket item, you will run into money laundering laws.
So, pick any real example and for the most part a fair comparison (i.e. not diagonal comparisons of speed to an exchange versus speed to buy a chocolate bar) with bitcoin will result in bitcoin being faster for a given level of risk.

 - "As such, the IMF could require member nations to pay part of their subscription quota with Bitcoins. This would require member nations to purchase Bitcoins independently" CHA-CHING
 - "But the absence of feasible statutory alternatives mitigates the thrust of these criticisms. Nothing else in the Articles of Agreement gives the IMF the power to control the impact of digital currencies."
 - "Alternatively, the IMF could collect Bitcoins directly from Bitcoin users rather than using member-nations as intermediaries."  I'd like to see them try.
 - "This solution is not, however, without its drawbacks. Collecting Bitcoins via a quasi- membership scheme creates a collective action problem. …The IMF would have to enter online Bitcoin exchanges like any other prospective Bitcoin user. Even if the IMF were able to transact with Bitcoin users directly, the recognition-in-exchange-for-trading scheme creates a tragedy of the commons: all Bitcoin users benefit from the increased legitimacy of IMF recognition, but no one individual user has an incentive to transact with the IMF. In fact, Bitcoin users might very well have incentive not to transact with the IMF right away." NO SHIT

(excuse the philosophising in this post).
Makes no difference.
The vast majority of the value of any currency comes from the network effect (c.f. Metcalfe's law) rather than its technical excellence.  There are, depending on your point of view, already technically superior coins to bitcoin -- doesn't matter though, Bitcoin has the biggest mindshare and it's hard to see that being toppled for some mere incremental improvement in features.
It's actually the same reason that Bitcoin finds it hard to replace fiat -- again, depending on your point of view, it's arguable that Bitcoin is superior to fiat, and yet the network effect holds fiat in its dominant position.
Overcoming the network effect needs a massive feature-advantage (Bitcoin is itself a massive jump from centralised currencies), or massive incompetence on the incumbent's part (see MySpace vs Facebook).
What's interesting in the cryptocurrency space is that friction is reduced once you have moved.  It's not hard to imagine a world where bitcoin is dominant and yet an app would be created that automatically interfaces to shapeshift-like services to pay any bill in the currency wanted by the recipient, regardless of whether you have bitcoin or any other crypto.  That means bitcoin's network effect will eventually be an advantage for _all_ cryptocurrencies and we'll see competition between them shift from network effect to feature-set.
That in turn means that the current bickering between various parties in the crypto-space is counter-productive for everyone.  What we need is _any_ cryptocurrency to "win" against fiat rather than each other.  The sooner the world is using cryptocurrency the better off it will be.  After that the playing field will be fairly flat to compete between the various coins.  That doesn't mean we should all "get behind" the "one true coin" it means that trying to sabotage each other is picking the wrong fight -- let a thousand flowers bloom.

@_date: 2018-12-07 19:20:35
That's not entirely true.
A currency represents the wealth of a country. If that country gets richer, then the currency per unit is worth more -- effectively you're invested in the productive capabilities of all your fellows. You'd be forgiven for not noticing that because with fiat at the same time that wealth is being generated your government and banks are printing the shit out of it, diluting the value of each currency unit. The "return on investment" for fiat has been consistently negative for the last hundred years (if not always).
So while I understand what you're saying and you're right to an extent, you have to ask if cryptocurrency ever matures to the point where it's so big that whales simply cannot move it like this and it's used on large scale for transactions... What would make the market value it more? The answer is that the market will be wealthier and will demand more of it... There will be no increased supply so instead the unit value will have to increase.

Actually a blockchain is a really shitty database.
Save for one feature: it enables us to solve the Byzantine generals problem with a massive number of generals. That solution only works because the blockchain incentivised consensus by issuing rewards... Measured in cryptocurrency tokens. So it doesn't work at all without a cryptocurrency. (Basically because without that, someone with a bigger, faster computer can come and subvert your chain, with it they are better off using that power to earn the token)

You should
 - Only store encrypted wallets
 - Not have the decryption keys for said wallets.  Decryption/signing should be done on my machine.
 - Have a thorough description of what technology you're using on your website.

I'm obviously not being clear.  Taking maximum risk is not what why you "deserve" your early adopter reward.  There are plenty of risky ventures that, by defintion, fail.  Reward in those cases was definitely not proportional to risk.
Bitcoin mining was not, by any stretch, risky.  It was as risky as running SETI  As it has turned out, if you had the foresight (bearing in mind what I've said: it was not risky) to run a bitcoin miner four years ago, and you had the foresight not to delete the wallet containing the coins then you are receiving a huge reward now.  So be it, but that reward is not great because of the great risk you took, it's because of the great foresight (or luck, or providence, or whatever you want to name it) you had.

X*y is not an accounting difficulty.
There would be no unpredictable exchange rate in a world where bitcoin is used for 90% of transactions -- bitcoin's current volatility is a function of its low volume.

Bear in mind that owning bitcoins isn't necessary for that equation to hold true.  Many people hold a large debt, denominated in fiat, and a large asset denominated in "my house".  The banks would be the ones who paid for hyperinflation.
Given the willingness of governments to do pretty much anything to protect the banks, my feeling is that they would throw any number of people under the bus to save a bank.  Hence, there will be no hyperinflation.
What there will be is high price inflation, with low wage inflation.  _That's_ when your bitcoins come in handy.

Money saved doesn't vanish.  It's invested by people borrowing it.  They borrow it to use it profitably.  It's not quite the bleak picture you paint.  Besides a shrinking economy creates the inverse upward pressure -- since the total size of the economy is smaller, individual units of currency are worth less, so a balance will be found, just as it is in an inflationary environment.

Bitcoin addresses are self-consistent in that they contain a checksum of themselves.  While it's possible, it's highly unlikely that any accidentaly corruption of an address will result in a valid address.

If you were someone with a weak password, then you have just paid for an expensive lesson in [entropy](  Learn from it.
For the rest of us: this is not an indictment of StrongCoin (and by extension blockchain.info) this is an endorsement (barring their bad security skills).  You should absolutely not be using any online wallet that keeps coins in a hot wallet.  You should absolutely not be using any online wallet that keeps your keys unencrypted or even encrypted with them retaining the key.  In fact, you absolutely should not be keeping your hard earned money in anything other than an encrypted wallet.
I wouldn't do it (I'm not quite so foolish): but if my encrypted wallet got published, I wouldn't be that concerned.

I've never been entirely convinced of that as an argument.  If we assume that it's possible to go from public key -&gt; private key (and there would be a lot more disruption in the world than just bitcoin if that were so), then hashing the public key does obfuscate it.
However, it also increases the attack space, since now I don't need your actual private key, just one that hashes to the same address as your private key.
Who knows which attack will turn out to be more feasible?

It isn't for the protocol to determine the value of a bitcoin.  Neither, in truth, is it for the exchange. You have to remember that the exchanges merely let us put our own estimations of value up for public consumption.
The value of any individual bitcoin is 100% a decision of their current owner.
The conclusion then is obvious; the decision about how much the miner values their own time to mine a block, and how much they value the bytes a transaction takes up -- with both of these measured in bitcoins -- is entirely up to them.  IMHO, the protocol should have nothing to do with minimum fees.
What I would like to see is a method for end users to find out when a transaction they issue has been rejected because its fee was too small.  That is where the protocol could help, and at present does not.

"fair" has nothing to do with it.
"price" is all there is.
Arbitrage is absolutely part of price discovery.  In fact almost all trade is arbitrage... buy lots of X over here, ship it over there where it will can be sold at a profit.  Profit equals competitive opportunity.  Competitor buys X and finds a better way of shipping it.  Price lowers.  Repeat until price is equalised everywhere.  Equalised price everywhere means the "true" price is known.

Your last paragraph answers your question.
Whatever logic makes you think early adopters will spend is true for everyone.

Okay -- let's ignore network effects.  Even then, bitcoin and derivative peer-to-peer currencies would still be great.
The worst part of the bitcoin experience now is the exchanges.  The reason they are the worst part?  The half of the exchanges that sits in the existing banking system.
Writing an exchange that does, say, bitcoin-to-litecoin, or bitcoin-to-bitcoin2, or bitcoin-to-amazoncoin would be much, much simpler and reliable.
It really doesn't matter if bitcoin is "the one" or not.  If we get a marketplace of currencies that don't have gatekeepers to stop us transferring our money easily... that will be fine.  The marketplace will then pick the best based entirely on their relative merits.  Then ... imagine your choice is between visacoins and bitcoins.

There is absolutely no need for a rule that strict.
All we want is a punishment for fast trading.  So... as time since last trade goes up, minimum trade amount goes down -- an inverse law.
It's a line of code,
    min_trade = Tuning_constant / time_since_last_trade
It's staggering that mt.gox haven't implemented this.  They'd simply select the constant such that a human-speed trader would never even notice it.  There's the actual problem solved.

Actually, in theory it takes five minutes on average, since your transaction appears at a random time, on average it's five minutes until the next block.
It's _at most_ ten minutes, when you broadcast your transaction just after a block is found.

@_date: 2013-04-26 09:05:01
With something as volatile as bitcoin, they _need_ to be able to convert any amount instantly.
Percentage is the way to go for now.
However, my regularly repeated suggestion is to make the minimum order time dependent -- the more recent your last trade was, the higher your next order must be.  Then you pick your constants so that only bots would get bitten by it.  i.e. minimum order for 1-second apart orders would be 1000 BTC, dropping rapidly to 0.0001 BTC after 60 seconds.
Secondly, you make the automated trade API only available to verified accounts.

Gold isn't dying.  Bitcoin and gold can be excellent bedfellows.  Bitcoin's "enemy" is fiat, not gold.  Gold will compete perfectly well on an open market for store-of-value.
What is true is that gold-holders probably don't like the idea of competitors to their, until now, monopoly on sound money.
Gold holders then are legitimately worried that a percentage of the value of gold attributable to its store-of-value properties might move to bitcoin.  That percentage however will never, ever, be 100%.

It's really not.  The loss of privacy is probabilistic.  In the contrived situation you describe, it's 50/50 whether you own the money by exactly your reasoning.  That's still 50/50 though -- not absolute anonymity at all.  This is exactly what the "taint analysis" on blockchain.info does.
The non-contrived situation is that it's highly unlikely that what you purchase costs exactly what you have in any particular address.  That creates a change address, and it's easy to assign a probability that you own that too.  Then later when I see the change address combine with another address to fund a second payment (which bitcoin does automatically when creating transactions) I can be fairly sure that the same person owns both addresses -- tying your past purchase to the present one.  The current supplier has your name and knows that you own two addresses.
Every time your wallet uses two addresses to fund a transaction you are leaking information.  Surely you can see that it's not hard to constantly analyse the blockchain, slowly gathering up single owners for multiple addresses?  You're viewing anonymity as if your step 3a/3b was the end (after which I'm already 50% sure of whether you own each address)... what about steps 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10?  Slowly but surely that information leak connects your pseudonymous bitcoin addresses more and more to a real identity.
As I say -- if you are happy, then who am I to dissuade you?  Your loss of privacy affects me not in the slightest.  I was genuinely merely trying to warn those who were not aware.

I expect that percentage will be the same as the percentage that go to the effort of obfuscating their bitcoin transactions to evade tax.  Maybe a touch more because people tend to value their money higher than their privacy, but it won't be much.

As I explained _verification time_ is not relevant for any normal level of transaction.  The propagation time of a transaction is about 10 seconds -- that's sufficient time to know that a transaction paying you exists and is on the network (have you ever actually used a bitcoin-accepting wallet? you get notified almost immediately).
The thing you're concerned about with verification time is the risk of a double spend.  The amount of computing power you need to pull off a successful double spend is prohibitively expensive; and if you had that power you would make money dedicating it to honestly mining instead of trying to scam newsagents out of newspapers and soda.  If that's still insufficient, services like BitPay take on that risk for you -- they have a sophisticated double-spend detection system that monitors widely separated nodes on the bitcoin network and so sees any double spend attempts.
The transaction limit per block has, as yet, affected no businesses.  When it becomes an issue, the developers and miners are all fully aware that the limit will need to be increased.  It was set as it is now to prevent the blockchain being filled up with dust transactions as a DOS attack.  It's arbitrary, and can be changed.  Also, better algorithms for setting transaction fees are being discussed and implemented, to make this problem moot in the future.  For now though, it's not stopping anyone ... can you point at a single business affected as you claim?
Lack of anonymity is being addressed with the CoinJoin project.  Blockchain has already implemented it; and we can fully expect other wallet software/providers to do the same.  At that point bitcoin will become anonymous with zero effort from its users.
You've obviously researched enough to come up with reasonable objections; but you've stopped researching before seeing that those objections are anticipated and solutions exist or are being worked on.

Bitcoin transactions propagate within seconds. They clear in ten minutes. Compare with card systems that take about a minute to swipe, enter pin, authorise and then days to clear. Even then the card payment is reversible.
Compare like with like. Bitcoin clears faster than any payment system in the world. If you treat transaction propagation as comparable to authorisation, that's faster too.

[Affirming the consequent](
e.g. Valuable gold must be dug out of the ground.  Therefore everything dug out of the ground is valuable.
Not true.
In essence: gold is valuable regardless of whether any effort was put in to get it.  It wasn't the digging that made it valuable.  Should you dig some gold out of the ground, at a cost of $10000, then the price of gold collapsed to zero, you would not be able to get that $10000 back.  Those costs are [sunk costs](
Sunk costs are always undertaken with the goal of getting something worthwhile, that doesn't alter the fact that they are sunk costs.  Your electricity bill is a sunk cost; you cannot unuse the electricity.  Purchasing a car is not a sunk cost, because you still have the car (modulo depreciation, which is a sunk cost).

Gox doesn't give a shit about volatility either.
Gox cares about volume.   In a shallow market, volume happens to equal volatility, but Gox won't care about that.
To say that is being overly critical though -- for the long term success of Bitcoin (which Mt.Gox has an obvious interest in), volatility is (perceived by most observers as) bad.  If Mt.Gox were looking to become a billion dollar exchange, or the bitcoin equivalent of FOREX in the future, they will have bitcoin's success in mind as well as their short term profits.

It's a cycle.  Price won't stabilise without an merchant-based economy.  You can't get merchants interested without customers.  You won't get customers with bitcoins without buy-in.  You can't have buy-in without selfish profit motive.  You can't have selfish profit motive without prices going up.

Bitcoin is perfectly comparably to gold because they both have utility value because of their specific properties that make them useful for storing wealth and transacting (although bitcoin kicks gold to the kerb in terms of transaction utility).

The technical limitations aren't set in stone.  There are plans in place to increase the arbitrary limit on the number of transactions per block.  That was originally in place merely to stop some rogues filling up blocks with dust transactions.
As for "time to verify": that results from a confusion in nomenclature.  The "verify" time for bitcoins is the equivalent of "clearing" in the banking world.  When you pay with a credit card, the card company says "yes, go ahead", but no money is transferred.  The equivalent with bitcoin is that the transaction propagates through the network, and that happens typically in less than 10 seconds.  The money is yours to spend after it's "confirmed", which typically takes 10 minutes.  The more confirmation blocks you get on top of that the more secure it is.
For low value transactions, the cost of subverting that transaction in the ten minutes before the confirmation happens is so high that you would be a foolish thief to do it for the price of a newspaper.  If you're selling a ferrari, you'd probably wait for an hour.  TLDR; you can safely accept payments for everyday transactions instantly.  What's more, with services like BitPay, it's their problem, not yours.

If I divide a cake in two, is there more cake?  Is a gold bar more valuable if I melt it down and make two half size bars?  Is a dollar worth more or less because a cent exists?
There are 21 million bitcoins.  That number is arbitrary but fixed.  The market has priced a bitcoin knowing that fixed amount.  If we know the price of a bitcoin, then half a bitcoin is worth half that -- i.e. bitcoins are just as scarce and just as valuable, regardless of how much you divide one up.  The divisions don't become as valuable as the whole when you divide... so what does it matter?

Even if we do end up as you describe, open competition will make things much better for all.  If your bank isn't transferring your bitcoins fast enough or cheap enough, there will be nothing to stop you from using the blockchain yourself.
I can also imagine that the time will come when we will have mini-blockchains, that will make blocks very quickly and have very short lifetimes.  Their job will be to create aggregate movements for the master blockchain.
Then there is the existence of something like ripple.  Bitcoin-denominated credit for high speed movement, with settlement done by the bitcoin blockchain.  It will convert financial operations that currently take days into ones that take an hour.

You have to be careful with your language, "it is not suitable for day to day business transactions".
Slices of banana aren't suitable.  Bitcoin absolutely _is_ suitable.  At present, it's just not _practical_ because the places you make day-to-day transactions don't accept bitcoins.
Stage 1 is surely bitcoin-as-store-of-value?  Once large numbers of people are holding bitcoin (even if they only got them in the hopes of making a quick buck), it's in a company's interest to be the first amongst their competitors to go after the bitcoiners.  Then we're at stage 2.


Me either; the euro, for example, makes it hard for low-productivity euro-countries to survive in the same world as the high-productivity euro-countries.  Fortunately, bitcoin will never be the "single global currency".  It's likely we'll see regional variants appear, and maybe even versions with different rules.

Here's my standard "scale of bitcoin" answer:
Bearing in mind that there are only 21 million bitcoins total...
 - If you own one, you are guaranteed to be at least one of the richest 21 million bitcoiners on the planet (of 7 billion people, that puts you in the top 0.3%).
 - If you own ten bitcoins you are in at least the top 0.03% richest bitcoiners on the planet
 - If you own one hundred you are in at least the top 0.003% richest bitcoiners on the planet
At present, maybe it doesn't matter much if you are a rich bitcoiner (the vast majority of people own zero bitcoins, so it's not that hard). Imagine though that bitcoin becomes large enough to be on the world stage, that say oil starts getting priced in bitcoins.
I don't know about you, but I'd like to be in the top 0.3% of richest dollar owners. Hell, the top 5% would do me very nicely. To be in the top 5% of bitcoin owners on the planet, I only need 0.006 BTC.

Your coins on a backed-up blockchain wallet are much safer than on Mt.Gox.
On blockchain your BTC are almost completely protected by the bitcoin system itself -- which is very, very secure (if it weren't bitcoin would already be dead).  Your money on Mt.Gox suffers two primary risks (there are others, but they are more to do with your own security measures -- keep your passwords/computer secure):
 - hacking of Mt.Gox's online wallet.
 - governments
Government risk can probably be split into two:
 - government stealing from Mt.Gox's bank account (a la Cyprus)

I'm not so sure; what you describe can certainly happen.  Especially if the rise comes about from speculation and value storage.  However, if the rise comes about because of increased usage, there will be plenty of day-to-day stuff to buy and the crash you predict will not happen.
I don't know what will be the cause of the rise, but it doesn't have to be because of a bubble.

A miner creates a block with a claim of a certain amount of work done to create it.  Thanks to some clever cryptography, while work was hard to do, it's very quick and easy to verify.
That's it.  That's all a miner can do.  They then send that block out onto the network.
(on of) The clever part of bitcoin is that it is for each individual in the network to decide if they consider _that_ block with _that_ proof of work sufficient to trust its transactions (the clients) and to build their next block on top of (the miners).
While there was incentive for the block creator to (as you say) create easy (but valid) blocks, there is no incentive whatsoever for everyone else in the network to accept that easy block (again as you say eventually lowering the worth of their bitcoins).  Instead, by tacit agreement, the rest of the network picks an acceptable difficulty such that production will be, on average, once every ten minutes.  Magic.

It depends.  Debian stable is released on a very conservative schedule.
However, Debian unstable is updated daily.  If there are no serious bugs reported in unstable updates, it migrates to Debian testing.  When a freeze is declared, only bug fixes are allowed to migrate from unstable to testing; and then a decision is made to release and testing migrates to stable.
The long-and-short of that is that Debian testing is a rolling release for all intents.  Many people just set their package manager to update to testing/unstable and have very few difficulties (like me).
There is a proviso that sometimes things can go wrong, and you will have to be able to fix it yourself.  Often though, it's a simple matter of knowing a few commands to downgrade a broken package or forcibly install an update.  It happens rarely to me though, and I don't mind living on the bleeding edge.  Also you don't have to always upgrade everything, I just upgrade whatever I happen to be using that day.  Gimp, inkscape, Libreoffice, gcc, all upgrade fairly painlessly.
Debian is of such high quality, that it's not unreasonable to say that Debian unstable is a lot more stable than many other distribution's "stable" releases.

Decreasing consumption is simply not true.  Even if we ignore the fact that there is vital consumption that cannot be deferred; and we ignore the fact that a different time preference doesn't actually alter consumption, only _when_ that consumption happens.
Here's a real example: 40 years ago, gold plated connectors used X amount of gold.  Thanks to technological progress (which translates to a deflationary pressure), the thickness required to gold plate electronics today has reduced an enormous amount.  That means you can now plate 100 connectors for the same resource use as you used to use for one.  That's, in the end, deflation.  Along with a million other advances, it's why electronics has gotten cheaper and cheaper and cheaper.  And yet no one has stopped consuming, and jobs in the electronics industry are growing if anything.
Imagine also the amount of resources needed to build the computing facilities for the original NASA missions.  Now imagine the amount of resources needed to create a smartphone.  The smartphone is orders of magnitude more powerful, and yet used orders of magnitude less resources.
Deflation doesn't have to mean reduced consumption; it can mean making expensive things cheaper, and hence improving more lives; and means making things that were impractical in the past, practical.
The benefit of those productive enhancements, at present, get eaten by governments -- when they print money, they are stealing the economic growth for themselves.  A deflationary currency will mean the benefits of economic growth go to (a) the population and (b) the planet -- as we find better, more efficient ways of using the limited resources we have.

Well yes, I guessed that.  I'm still at a loss to see how a linearly growing "transactions per hour" results in a quadratically growing blockchain.
e.g.  Let's use transactions-per-block as the rate measure (to save dealing with a scaling constant); treat all transactions as minimal in size for the sake of argument; and treat the block overhead as negligibile. 100 tpb @ 244 bytes each is a blockchain growing at 244\*100 bytes per block.  At 1000 tbp it's 244\*1000 bytes per block.  At N, it's 244\*N bytes per block.  That's N, not N^2, not N^3.  The blockchain grows linearly with linear transaction growth.

I don't believe that's true.  The wealthy can afford to keep their wealth in assets.  Completely immune to inflation.  (google "inflation hurts the poor" for articles).

Sales taxes are one of the most damaging economically.
Consider the world before sales tax: everybody has some amount of net income, from which they pay their bills, and buy their luxuries.  Let's say its $1 trillion.  That means $1 trillion is shared between all the businesses in the country.
After sales tax is introduced, every single one of their purchases has some percentage taken off it, let's say its 1% for the sake of argument.  That $1 trillion available for spending has become $990 billion, with the government taking the other 1%.
You can buy less with the same amount of money, means there is less money to go around the same number of businesses.

Of course there is.  The limit is just the effect of parameters written in the code.  There's no way to change _bitcoin's_ limit; but it's not inherent to cyrptocurrency that there can only be 21 milllion (times 100,000,000) units.  In fact, with an hours work you could easily alter those parameters in the bitcoin source -- why don't you show us all how much better your parameters would be, with their inflationary goodness?  The beauty of a free market in open source cryptocurrencies is that you can easily put your money where your mouth is.


Because you want what you're buying today rather than tomorrow?  Food?  Water?  Rent?  Electricity? Fuel?  You've conveniently ignored time-preference in your analysis.  Unfortunately time-preference is pretty important.
Your logic would apply even in an inflationary world -- why would anyone ever spend any capital they have invested that is earning more than inflationary interest?  As people manifestly _do_ spend money, it demonstrates that the deflationary argument is bunk.


Maybe they would if an ounce of it could be subdivided into 100,000,000 parts and recombined without thought or loss?  Maybe they would if you could store 100 tonnes of gold as easily as you can store one ounce?  Maybe they would if you could transfer gold anywhere in the world down an internet tube?  Maybe they would if gold eliminated all counter-party risk?  Maybe they would if you didn't need to get out a set of scales and an assayers license to verify the authenticity of the gold?

I think you're blending bitcoin as it is now... 50% changes in a day (which means nobody will sensibly specify a price in bitcoins), and bitcoin as it will be, a slowly deflationary currency.
In the second case, if I expect a contract to last three months, and I (reasonably) anticipate my currency to inflate by 0.5% during that time, then I can price lower on the contract.  Just as with an inflationary currency, I would price higher.
All the problems you list apply equally, but oppositely to an inflationary currency, so why isn't a problem for dollars?
Employees now expect pay increases every year.  Why? Because we all know that our pay is not worth as much next year as this.  If the currency was deflating, we would get our pay rises by virtue of getting a more valuable currency next year than this year and would need no nominal pay rise.

This is the same nonsense that has been spouted about Bitcoin since its inception.  Boiled down it says this: bitcoin will never be a success (its price shooting through the roof) because its price will shoot through the roof.  Completely circular.
Price is the mechanism that deals with this problem.  If bitcoins aren't wanted by merchants as the price goes up, they become less valuable, so the price goes down.  Classic negative feedback.  It can only result in a stable price.  The current surge will settle; it's simply not possible for exponential increases to continue indefinitely.

As I said -- _I_ agree there is no risk of default, they will be paid by monetising the debt.  I don't think that's a problem for the creditors; they will get paid.  What's more they'll get paid with freshly printed dollars. The first spenders of new money gets the advantage of it therefore treasuries _are_ completely rationally priced.
Besides, what else would they do with their money?  Every other stable economy is doing the same thing, GBP and EUR are getting quanatitively eased as well.

I'll withdraw my silly rhetoric, "The USA has never been anywhere near metric", but I don't think the USA government is "completely metric".  What the USA has done is only "kind of" metrification.
They're happy to use all the SI definitions for units as a basis; but they don't use (enforce) those units.  For example, the USA uses inches, which are defined as 25.4mm rather than the haphazard imperial definition, one third of a barleycorn or somesuch.
You'll forgive me if I don't think that's the same as the USA using the actual metric units.  They've just switched to metric definitions for their imperial units.
To be fair, they've been trying since 1975 to change.  But units are ingrained.  Despite having been metrified over a decade ago, the UK is still pretty awful, with a great many people who stubbornly think that SI units are some horrible EU mandate.

I've never entirely understood the logic that "Gresham's law means Bitcoin will fail" because it's circular...  I'm not entirely sure I've understood Gresham's law, so forgive me if the following is nonsense.
Gresham's law says that we will use bad money in preference to good money, because we value the good money more.  The conclusion then is that no one will spend the good money (bitcoins) and they will therefore stagnate.  Doesn't that mean they become less good and so Gresham's law applies less and less?
As far as I can tell, it's the same as all economics, supply and demand.  If bitcoins are good money, then that makes the demand for them higher, I would rather keep my bitcoins than dollars.  That drives the price of them up (measured in bad money).  Eventually an equilibrium must come where what I can buy in exchange for my bitcoins is equal to the value I place on them?
I see this in my own usage of them; they are worth $16 each at the moment, but I value them higher than that, because, all other things being equal, I would rather spend $16 worth of fiat than $16 of bitcoin. 
At the other end of the spectrum, if I could spend 0.0001% of my bitcoin holdings (today) and buy myself an annuity that would keep me comfortable for the rest of my life, I would definitely do it.
Therefore there must be an exchange rate (I don't know what it is) where my bitcoins and dollars would be equally desirable to me.  Aggregate that across all actors in the market and we have a market price for bitcoins.  At that point, Gresham's law is irrelevant because we would see them both as good/bad as each other -- even bearing in mind the potential for devaluation of dollars.

None of these requirements are in place to protect your money.

Alternative: adopt bitcoin and don't commit to liabilities?
In a practical world: commit to your liabilities in the shitty currency... USD, save your capital in a good currency... BTC.
How is that a chicken-and-egg problem?  Oh, yes, I see, you live in a world where the entire economy runs on debt and you think that that is a necessity.  It's not.
With your supplier example: bitcoin would encourage you to remove late payment terms from your customers.  Pay now, or no goods.  While that might be inconvenient for those companies that are funding themselves from the pockets of their suppliers, it is not a requirement for trade to take place.

I'm willing to agree, once you successfully define "intrinsic value" for me.
That request is rhetorical -- there is no such thing as "intrinsic value", so (3) is true for all money, not just fiat.  That makes wiki (and other) sources definitions just plain wrong, since gold sfall under the definition of "fiat" that you cite.
I'm not even sure it's possible to have private fiat money; since it's not possible for private money to be given value by decree.  The term I've used for bitcoin before now is "lex legis" or maybe "concordia" -- value, _by agreement_.

Bitcoins absolutely can be traced.  They only work because every single one can be traced right back to the block that minted it.
If you can identify an address on the chain, you have gone a long way to tracking the owner.  In some ways it's even easier than the traditional banking system, because the block chain is public knowledge -- you need no warrant, no law and no men in black to stand on a bank manager's head.
Government has very little trouble taxing fiat cash businesses.  Bitcoin will be no harder than that.  At the very least they could simply order employers to inform them of the NI/SS number associated with every payment they make to an employee bitcoin address; and boom, the government now tracks everything you buy from your paycheck.

Three short sentences?  No.  TLDR; it's mostly an in-browser wallet, but with the ability to do perfect coin mixing.
The killer feature is co-operative mixing.  The idea (as I understand it) is that we all get together and say "we would like to mix 10 BTC to XXXXX,YYYY target addresses", we each put our 10BTC into a _potential_ transaction; but we don't sign that transaction yet.  Instead we watch this potential transaction, and we observe its outputs -- when we see outputs to our XXXX and YYYY addresses that equal our inputs, we sign.
The effect is that the output 10BTC is now mixed in a single transaction with everybody else who submitted 10BTC to the mix.  There is then no way to know which 10BTC total output belongs to which 10BTC total input.  In fact, assuming the amounts are all arbitrary and come from multiple addresses and go to multiple addresses, there is no way to know how much each person mixed, nor how many people were involved in the mix.
It's a very clever idea that solves one of the key problems of being trackable via the blockchain.  I foresee problems with it because someone has to be the first to sign the transaction, but you're only willing to sign your inputs if all the other inputs are signed, guaranteeing your outputs.  I might be missing something though.

I understand it just fine.
Private keys represent ownership of coins. They are the ability to make block chain transactions - transactions being transfer of value to another private key. An alternative way of transferring the value represented by a private key, other than transferring that value to another key, is to transfer the actual private key.
People already do this. As I said, have a look at how casacius physical coins work.
There are also in between states.  With no internet but a bit of working technology, you could still retain copies of the last known block chain. It's only a few gigabytes and fits on a flash drive. That can be used to verify the value on any given public key. Besides we're comparing store of value... Why do you want transactions?
Is it as good as the full online bitcoin? No. But it is still workable until the world gets the internet running again. Gold, in a technology collapse, would have it's own problems, but you conveniently ignore the fact that carrying around wheelbarrows of gold is not easy, nor is verifying that gold hasn't been debased easy.

Bitcoin regulation directly, for practical purposes, cannot be done.
However, put that in context: cash is pretty hard to "regulate".  They can print it, but they can't stop you handing a $50 bill to whomever you wish.  Bitcoin is the same.
Cash does get regulated indirectly though, and Bitcoin will get regulated in the same places: where it interacts with other regulable entities.  Exchanges, businesses (who want to keep on the right side of corporate law), employers, and banks, will all be subject to other, unavoidable regulation.  It will not be hard for governments to add "all deposits of 100BTC or more must trigger a notification to $AGENCY".
Summary: for black-to-black market transactions, bitcoin will be just like cash, and be unregulatable. The non-black economy though will be just as subject to regulations as a cash business is.  Just as with cash businesses -- a bit of creaming off the top will probably go on, but stepping completely off the grid is unlikely.

To me, it seems there is far more possibility of manipulation in the regulated stock/currency markets than in bitcoin.
The bitcoin exchanges give us mere mortals access to the fundamentals that we can't get access to in the rest of the financial world.  That leads to the position that any manipulation of price _only_ damages the manipulator.  What is manipulation other than buying or selling at other than market price?  When the market is free to take you up on your manipulating offer, then run off to your competitor and reverse it, you will have to keep funding your lie out of your own pocket.
On the other hand, I do believe it's perfectly possible for an exchange operator to abuse their position to profit unfairly (that's different from price manipulation).  They could easily give their own trades priority before some other significant trade goes through.  Having access to the trade queue means they can push to the front without anyone noticing.
Who can say whether that's going on or not; but it would have the effect of a stealth fee increase (i.e. you would always get a worse price) over your honest competitor.  Eventually the market would sort that out -- your dishonesty leaves a margin that a competitor can fill.

You're just repeating yourself. I have understood what you said. You're ignoring every response I make though.

I said etch on gold to demonstrate that the bitcoin key can be as physical as gold. It could be etched on anything is the point. If the world decays so much that there is no more electricity or internet you are kidding yourself if you think gold will retain its current value. Food and ammunition will be more valuable, and storage of wealth of little concern.
That being said... Bitcoins don't require the internet. The private key can be passed just as easily physically. See casascius coins for the method.

Bitcoins will survive the elements.  If I etched my private key on a gold bar, would that make you happier? I could etch it on ten gold bars -- backup.  I could print out ten copies and put them in safe deposit boxes on different continents.
Your gold might survive the elements, but you wouldn't necessarily retain ownership of it.  If a tsunami hit then your gold could be washed away, just like your computer with bitcoins on.  Except you can backup your bitcoins.
You admit that you can only lose bitcoins if they are online; and that you can store them "offline", but you ignore the fact that gold is _always_ offline.  You don't have the option.  So if we're comparing "offline" gold, then why can't my bitcoins be "offline" too?
Your physical gold can be stolen. Just as a virus could steal your bitcoins.  You take appropriate precautions.
The only thing Gold has going for it over bitcoins is history.  Every other property you value in gold can be replicated with bitcoins.  Now, that historical value is worth a fair bit, so I don't wish to minimise it, nor talk you out of gold if that's what you want to hold.  But gold is not objectively "better" for just holding.

Not safely. If you were using a hosted wallet the change address is not necessarily linked to the spender.
Imagine I operate a wallet for ten people.  I hold 100 BTC on one address, and keep their individual balances in my own database (c.f. all exchanges, and a few online wallets).  You tell me to send 0.2BTC to pay for you soda.  With bitcoin you always have to spend the entire balance of any given previous output so I have to create a transaction that has 100BTC input.  I (or rather my wallet) send 0.2 to the vendor and 99.8 back to myself (often referred to as the "change" in the bitcoin transaction).
If you then ask the vendor to refund 0.18BTC and he refunds it to the change address; he's refunding it to my wallet, and I have no way of knowing that he intended it for you, so your balance in my database is never updated, and I am now holding an extra 0.18BTC that I can't identify.

I think lots of commenters are missing the point.  You're all right that killing someone is probably not going to solve the problem.  The point of an assassination market though is that no one will have to get killed.  The presence of an assassination market, where the result will be your death if you are a public enough douchebag, is that you will stop behaving like a douchebag out of self-interest.
Who knows if it would work; but it's a fascinating idea -- and it's really got very little to do with _actually_ killing people.
I'm not really advocating it; and I suspect it is doomed to failure because it self-regulates in that most people are not in favour of assassination.  It's an intriguing use of game theory though.  I think I'd watch the film.

You've gotten very aggressive very quickly.  I have no idea why.
It's certainly not bullshit, and it's allowed to be contrived, and it's allowed to be for one person in one desert because it is sufficient to come up with one counter-example to refute your assertion that value is intrinsic.  If something has intrinsic value then that value is irrevokable, there is no situation that would take that value away.  The fact that gold would not sustain your life in the desert and water would is exactly the demonstration needed to show that value is subjective -- i.e. it depends on context.
If you say "all leaves are green" then I need a sample of one non-green leaf to disprove your thesis.


Gold's scarcity is what gives it value (at least in part, along with some other natural properties it has).  Hence gold's value comes from its utility too.  Why is Gold's utility any more "intrinsic" than Bitcoin's?


Scarcity _can_ create value, natural or otherwise.  Not everything scarce is valuable though.  For example I could produce you a one-of-a-kind feltip drawing of my cat, but it would not be valuable.
But I'm not sure why you raise this subject anyway -- bitcoins are scarce too, so that still doesn't tell us anything about why gold is fundamentally any different from bitcoin.

I seriously doubt that.  I think you're mixing super-computers and computers.  The top ten might equal the power of the remaining 450, but that is nothing like the same as "half the worlds computing power". The top computer in that top 500 list is 17,500 TFlops.  A 3GHz Pentium4 is 12 GFlops.  The top computer then is equal to 1,458,333 high end pentiums.
Let's say all the top ten were as fast.  We'd only need 14,558,333 Pentiums to equal all of them.
For your assertion to be true then, the entire rest of the world would have to have the equivalent of 14.5million Pentiums.  That's without even considering all the GPU computing that's available (and the best of them can hit 600 GFlops).
I still call shenanigans.  Your own figures suggested 300 million CPUs a year, more than enough to equal and best the top ten -- and that's only this year.  If we add up the last, say, 3 years worth, then the top 10 supercomputers are dust.  We could only talk about China's 70 million and still have plenty of margin to cope with the fact that they aren't all top-of-the-range Pentiums.
The reason that Bitcoin is so impressively secure is precisely because the top computers in the world altogether can't come close to equaling the power of all the individual computers added together.  Bitcoin mining hasn't even been adopted on the smallest percentage of those and it still has an unmatchable level of power.

That doesn't sound right.  The tips can be returned if they aren't claimed.  That implies that the tipbot manages its own wallet internally and allows people to cash in/cash out to their bitcointip account as they wish.  It is only the cash in/cash out that would generate blockchain transactions.

Capital gains is due when you give a gift, as that's considered realisation of an asset just as selling it is.
Provided the gift is definitely not secretly disguised income, then there will be no income tax on it. But the new owner of the bitcoins has to start tracking value for their own capital gains problems.
Tax is a pain in short.

You don't.  It was a bad design decision to force the blockchain to be loaded forward from the genesis block (which is simply a hard-coded checkpoint) rather than backwards to the latest checkpoint (of which there are many in the clients).
Combined with the ability to selectively fetch blocks containing particular transactions; any client could have been up and running instantly; and you could fetch whatever quantity of history suited you.

I didn't say "rarely" was inaccurate.  It is completely accurate.  But it's not the same as what you claimed: "cannot prosecute" -- that was my fundamental objection to your comment.  Governments definitely _can_ and have made retroactive law, "cannot" is therefore misleading.  We should all be aware exactly what the risks of using bitcoin are (personally, I'm happy enough with "rarely" as enough risk mitigation).
I'm not familiar enough with the US constitution to say; but if it is as you say: excellent -- if only it were so everywhere.  It's worth noting though, that the government have _tried_ in the US, even when they've been later struck down. It's also worth noting _from the article I haven't read_, "Not all laws with retroactive effects have been held to be unconstitutional", and goes on to list some.
As for the human rights act... HA.  Have you read it?  Every right that is granted is given a special opt out for "when the government thinks it's necessary", forgetting entirely that the first job of a bill of rights is to protect the citizens from their government.  And "frowned upon"?  Give me a break -- pretty much everything the UK government does at the moment is "frowned upon".


Then you aren't looking.  Bitcoin legislation will come down to tax/money law, and that is exactly the place where governments have regularly retroactively prosecuted.  You really don't see the possibility for them simply to declare "bitcoin capital gains are now applicable from 2011 onwards, regardless of whether you have liquidated them or not"?

I'm saying that human emotion and psychology of a mass quantity of people can't be boiled down to a single line graph, and if they could, investing would be trivially easy.

 - google all time... no
 - yahoo all time... no
 - news corp all time... no

 - pearson plc all time ... no
You get the idea.
This chart's only use is for post-hoc reasoning.  That's texas sharpshooting where you pick your times after the fact to make it match.


If you want to make a real prediction with this chart, go right ahead... lets see it overlaid on some bitcoincharts output with some numbers and timescales on it.  Then we wait a while and see how accurate the prediction was.

The point is that the government trace you from source; it doesn't matter if you mix them.  You're identified.

There are plenty of good things about bitcoin, but I seriously doubt it will make government's unable to collect tax.

That's nowhere near the complete story of FRB.
The problem is that the person receiving the loan deposits in a bank, or spends it, and it is then deposited in a bank.  Either way, the bank can then store a portion of _that_ deposit and lend it out again.  Imagine a 10% fractional reserve ratio, and $1000 of real printed cash is created by the government:
1000 + 900 + 810 + ... 
All of these balances exist in the bank, totalling much more than the original 1000.  This would be a 10x effect.
Even worse: there has been no real fractional reserve system in place for about 30 years.  Banks create money essentially unlimited.  During the peak of the financial crisis, the difference between issued cash and deposits was actually 80x.
Banking 101 will explain all this:

True enough.  I was not precise enough.  I think my point is made though: the fact that the US has never defaulted on a payment is hardly relevant for evaluating the value of the debt.
The US could "overcome debt" a thousand times worse with a flick of a pen.  The "risk of default" is clearly practically zero for US-denominated debt incurred by the US government.  No one would therefore argue that the debt is insurmountable.
In fact, it is the citizenry who will suffer under the conditions that, anywhere else, would be a default.  Since a default punishes the creditor, but printing money punishes the currency holders.

Okay: more seriously...
I can well imagine a situation where a bitcoin bank exists.  It would be more akin to the (completely false) understanding that people have of current banks: the bank would do the due dilligence on finding places to loan deposits, and would to a degree spread the risk of those loans across all investors.

If someone could offer an improvement on Bitcoin's proof-of-work system, it would be profound for computing, not just for Bitcoin.  Hell's teeth, it would be huge for cryptography.  I seriously doubt however that that revolution will come from some know-nothing blogger.

Satoshi put no thought at all into choosing those numbers.  He wasted a huge portion of the 64-bit space available in the protocol -- 11 bits of the 64 can never be used but are carried in every single transaction; and non-halving friendly numbers for the reward.
Sum of geometric series:
    21 * 10^6 * 10^8 = 100x10^8 * 210,000
                     = 2*inital_reward * blocks_per_halving
Should have been
    2^64 = 2^47 * 2^17
 - initial_block_reward = 2^46
 - blocks_per_halving = 2^17 = 131,072
To put us around a similar scale as we have now that would probably mean making the initial reward 64 "bitcoins" and 2^40 satoshis to the bitcoin.
If it was really felt necessary to use powers of ten, there are better numbers there too; but I don't really see that humans would have to care about that stuff.  The advantage of the powers of two is that there are 46 reward halvings available without having to care about rounding.

The problem is that your argument is based on the (untested) hypothesis that people living without a government will inevitably descend into raping/pillaging.  Governments have been persuading its populations for centuries that there is "an upside to regulation and taxes" -- that idea is now ingrained at a multi-generational level.  But it is only an idea.
It's not sufficient to say "look at somalia", because their are plenty of similarly dangerous places that _do_ have governments.  That implies that a society being rapey is not directly a function of whether there is a government or not.  If the correlation is not true in one direction, it is not true in the other direction -- namely removing the government from 1st world country would not necessarily turn that country into Somalia.
I would happily move to "somewhere such regulation doesn't exist", provided I know a couple of million other like-minded people are coming too.  Or alternatively, let the couple of million stay where they are and remove the government around them.

I appreciate your comments.  I certainly don't have anything against Bitstamp explicitly.  I've used them to trade quite significant amounts of money.
However, losing money would be annoying but not the end of the world, and I can choose the amount to leave at risk at any one time to suit myself.  The risk of belly-up can therefore be managed.  The loss of identity is considerably greater.
I understand that the limited shield protects the director financially; but nothing protects your reputation.  And secrecy doesn't instill trust.  If you're trustworthy, you stand in front of your company.  Especially if it's a small one, with one director as Bitstamp seems to be.
As I mentioned above, the change from a Slovenian address to a remailing UK address is similarly suspicion inducing.  It smacks of obfuscation.  If it's just a convenience, then put both addresses on the web site.
All this stuff, just gives one that itchy skin feeling -- especially when money and identity are involved.
Finally -- if you're going to ask for identity on AML and KYC grounds, then I'd like to see the official documents published on the website requiring them to do so; I'd like to see which official organisation is in turn monitoring them.  I'd also like to see a policy on how my identity will be protected from both hackers, and rogue employees.

I'm afraid it is exactly a gold rush.
Assume that Bitcoin is going to be a success at some undefined time in the future.  By success, I mean "becomes a world currency".  At that time it will be (at least) $10,000 per coin.  That means every single coin you can get your hands on now, by being first in the queue, will be the best investment you will ever make.
c.f. gold rush... whoever got the rights to an area with gold in it made enormous profits simply because they were first to sign up.
It can certainly be argued that bitcoin investors today are taking an enormous risk that that initial assumption is not true -- 100% loss is still entirely possible -- so when/if the reward comes, it should be justifiably high.  Just as it was high for those who packed up their lives and headed for no-man's land in the hope they would stumble on gold.

As to your tax fraud and illegal trade worries; I think you put too much stock in Bitcoin's anonymity and not enough in government's ability to control.  Already, without bitcoin, government has your employer collecting most of your taxation at source -- why would that change just because you are paid in bitcoins?  If my employer wanted to, he could pay me cash, and some employers do indeed avoid tax _already_ by doing just that.  However, they still have to account for inputs and outputs.  None of which changes if bitcoin became prevalent.
Illegal trade happens today with cash, and will go on regardless. If anything bitcoin makes it easier to find out where it's happening as every transaction has to be recorded and publicly broadcast.

I don't think it was a a computer-based attack.  You sound like you know what you're doing, but I think you've jumped at a technical explanation when the explanation is human.
A JavaScript exploit, even if it did upload something, is unlikely to get access to the file selection dialog, which is actually supplied by the graphical toolkit, and is really, really unlikely to be used by javascript.
The explanation then is that a _human_ accessed that directory using the file selection dialog; either in firefox or in some other application.  If you are certain it wasn't you, that leaves only one possibility: some other human did it.  Who has had physical access to your system?  Start looking at them with suspicion.

When I pay for dinner in a restaurant, it takes, say about 30 seconds to _authorise_ the payment.  The restaurant _does not have the money_ at that point.
A few days later the slow-as-molasses banking system _clears_ the payment, and they then have the money and can spend it.
With bitcoin, the transaction gets broadcast through the network, at that time the supplier's receiving node tells them it has been received.  This takes seconds.  (If you check out blockchain.info, it'll even give you a warning if an attempt to double spend has appeared on the network -- and double spends have to happen fast).  This is the bitcoin equivalent of _payment authorized_.  If we were being fair though, it's already considerably more likely to _stay_ authorized than a card payment.
Approximately ten minutes later the first confirmation of that transaction is mined.  The payment is now the suppliers, and it's extraordinarily unlikely that it can be undone at this point.  Fifty minutes later, another six confirmations have been layered on top.  That's the bitcoin equivalent of _cleared_ -- the supplier has the actual money.
In short: it takes less time to get a more reliable confirmation on the bitcoin network than you would get from the card network.  When a supplier accepts a card payment, they are trusting on "blind faith" that the card company will eventually reimburse them.  That blind faith is considerably less justified than it is when you get a bitcoin payment.
TLDR; the merchants you talk about can forget about 15 minute confirmations.  They can quite safely use "payment received" type announcements from bitcoin to release goods.  Even better, they'll be able to spend that money within the hour (rather than within the week).

Market cap represents the mass, of our fledgling currency.  With enough financial mass, comes financial inertia.

It's not so much that they are soaring in value; it's that they are circumventing the capital controls and allowing the native currency to fall to it's correct value.  (At least that's what I guess).
That being said, there is already precedent for location-aware bitcoin valuations.  For the two weeks that MtGox switched off dollar withdrawals there was a $10 spread between Mt.Gox and Bitstamp.  i.e. dollars-in-mt.gox were worth less than dollars-in-bitstamp.

I've withdrawn all my coins from Bitstamp in anticipation of this.  I'll put a small amount back once the dust settles to find out what the requirements actually are.  Mt.Gox introduced that stupid "you must get a notary to sign something" rule.  As if.  Let's also remember that Bitcoinica started verifying accounts, and got hacked -- the verification was scans of your passport, utility bills, bank statements -- an identity thief's wet dream.
It's an annoying state of affairs, because for SEPA transfers (and I guess all the other bank transfers, but I've never seen them on my UK statements) the receiving party gets a lot of information about the sending bank on their bank statement. Obviously even more is needed to transfer money out since you have to fully describe where it's going.
The sending bank won't have issued an account without knowing all about their customer (else they really would be in trouble with the gov). Therefore, if an investigator ever came knocking on the exchange's door it should be enough to simply show them a copy of the sending bank details and they can go back to their traditional methods for tracking down money launderers.
In short: exchanges don't need any of this KYC shit (for certain categories of transfer); your identity is already sufficiently known to them for any government agency that comes calling. That they are being made to gather it is a way of forcing them into the "you will be assimilated" part of the financial world.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:28:08
Also -- for a grocery store purchase, the security you get from 6 confirmations is _massive_ overkill.  You have to remember that bitcoin nodes are securing the blockchain with massive hashing brute-force searches.  Those 6 confirmations represent such staggering numbers of confirmations, that you have to be insane to think it's necessary for a couple of hundred dollars.  Because of this "most sellers require around 6 confirmations" is a huge distortion.  They really don't.  The only time you would wait is if you are transferring really significant value -- which isn't happening in the grocery store.  They are more likely to be victims of armed robbery than have an unconfirmed transaction reversed.
It's the equivalent of getting a security van, plus guard, plus body guard with handcuffed suitcase and license-to-carry to transport your wallet with $50 in it around.
I'd be surprised if there has even been a single attempt to double spend a cash-comparable transaction.  There certainly hasn't been a sucessful one.

It's difficult to know for sure; but we could certainly argue that shutting down the exchanges lowers bitcoin supply, which we'd expect to raise prices.
One might argue that it also lowers the supply of dollars equally, so I guess it will depend on whether people are buying bitcoin with their dollars in the hopes of buying dollars or not -- my guess is "not", what with them starting with dollars anyway.

Most of the time, yes.
But it's not a universal truth.
Let's say you bought 100 BTC at $1.  Well then a 100% move from $1 to $2 would make you $100.  A move to $3 would make you another $100.  You don't necessarily think that the second $100 is less valuable than the first $100, even though the second $100 was a pathetic 50% change.
In essence -- which plots you use depends what you want to know.

Do we not learn anything?  Bitcoin's price is a function of it's expected future value, as much as it's current worth.  That is to say the price takes the future into account.
Nobody thinks that the US government is _really_ shutdown.  This is just word play.  Everyone knows that it will be back.  That's not a shutdown then.  It's just a minor inconvenience for those that care; and nothing at all to those who don't.
Why then would bitcoin react in the slightest?
Go and tell the stock market that the money printing is included in the shutdown, and is permanent, and you'll see a reaction.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:16:42
No, the _probability_ of sucessful wrongdoing directly correlates to available processing power.  What you win for that is whatever you can get someone to accept without confirmations while your double spend is in progress.  That's why it's not worth doing for little transactions.
So... it is worth doing for the big transactions; but then the merchant will find that it's worth making the customer wait for an hour, and getting their address before handing over the keys to the yacht.
The lovely fallout of this is that, if you have access to that sort of processing power, you will make more profit by behaving honestly than dishonestly.  Truly bitcoin is, in this respect, amazing ... it removes dishonest incentives.
(there is some extra stuff I could say about 51% attacks, but these days, the computing power you need to get 51% of the network is simply staggering, so I'll discount that possibility).

No, you can have one leg of your payment system in the exchange and one in the client's payment site. When the customer clicks buy you execute the order.

While there may well be a huge component of the price made up of those factors, it's completely unjustified to say that they are the "only" thing giving bitcoin value.
There are merchants willing to accept bitcoins in exchange for goods and services.  _That_ gives bitcoin value, regardless of any speculation.
However, it's equally true to say that without the speculators it would be very difficult for us to find out what the current value of a bitcoin is, making it very hard for those same suppliers to set their prices in bitcoins.  i.e. the speculators are adding value too, merely by speculating.


There are a (for all practical purposes) infinite number of potential bitcoin addresses.  They're not all valuable though.  I hope you see the analogy I'm making -- just because gold is a substance that is dug out of the ground, that does not make the infinite number of possible substances that can be dug out of the ground as valuable as gold.

@_date: 2013-08-20 16:57:05


They don't; but they are your fundamentals.  That's what bitcoin's price is ultimately based on.  Unlike traditional stocks and shares, were you can go and look at balance sheets, an estimated values for IP, you're out of luck with Bitcoin.  Doesn't mean that they aren't there, they're just not easily quantified.  In fact, the only reasonable method we have for quantifying them is the marketplace -- and that says "approx $100 per coin".


The first mover advantage is nothing to do with future price.  It is only that bitcoin has the network effect behind it versus any other cryptocurrency that might appear to compete with it.  Even if that competitor is better, it has to contend with the inertia that bitcoin has already built to bring it to over a billion dollars cap.
You're right that the first mover could be into a loss (although if we're being pedantic, the first mover investors have already made a killing); but that doesn't negate the advantage that bitcoin has.  If _a_ cryptocurrency is going to become successful, bitcoin's first mover advantage means that bitcoin is likely to be it.


Bitcoin might be shut down by legislation, or might collapse because a flaw is found in cryptography in general, or in bitcoin specifically.  Either of those, and presumably a few other circumstances, will take it to $0.  That's the "not works" case; if bitcoin does work, then, since it has no mouths to feed in the traditional company sense, then like email and the web, it is only a question of time.  For example, once a business has put in the effort to accept bitcoin, it would take more effort to stop accepting it -- for what advantage?  Over time then, there is a kind of ratchet effect; bitcoin will keep more users than it loses, and that's all that's necessary to see ever increasing prices.
You only need to chuck a stone at google to find a million pontificators coming up with a million different calculations for the potential market for bitcoin.  Jeez -- even if it only replaces PayPal, then it's probably 100 fold undervalued right now.


Look -- I was trying to be helpful, if it doesn't help you fine; but your sarcasm quotes are just rude.  My "calculations" used the standard definition of expected value; and I kept every variable general until the end, leaving it as a judgement call for the reader to plug their own estimates of those numbers in.  My calculations were based on _no premises whatsoever_ other than my stated assumption that bitcoin is a binary proposition -- complete success or complete failure.
If you don't accept that proposition, that's fine, I'm not trying to persuade you -- I've made my choices and am happy with them.  I was trying to help you with what I thought was a genuine question: you asked us remember?  "what information are you using?" "what do you consider...?"  well I told you.

Bitcoin's fundamentals are the cryptocurrency technology and the network-effect first-mover advantage.  Daytrading is nothing to do with fundamentals, so forget that.  That leaves long term investment.  For that, look at the world, look at the technology, see if you think that the technology fills a need in the world.
Here's my logic, in case it helps you:
Bitcoin doesn't really have a middle-ground when it comes to success, so in ten years it will either be $0, or $HIGH.  Whatever you invest today then could go to $0 -- that's your risk.  Let's call the probability of success, `p`.  The probability of failure is then `1-p`
Let's further say that we're investing `x`, and that success will be `100x` and failure `-x` (i.e. loss of everything).  We can now calculate expected value (sum of probability of value multiplied by value):
    E(x) = (-x)(p-1) + 100xp
    = 100xp - xp + x
    = 99xp + x
Let's invest one unit... x=1 so that all our figures are now per-unit invested.
    E(1) = 99p + 1
And calculate the "break even" probability, i.e. when our expected profit is greater than zero.
    E(1) &gt; 0
    99p + 1 &gt; 0
    99p &lt; -1
    p &gt; 1/99
Translation: if there is greater than 1% chance of the price increasing 100-fold, then bitcoin is a good bet.
I used a `100x` factor by pulling it out of thin air.  Let's parameterise that too...
   p &gt; price_now / (price_future - 1)
Translation: if there is a greater than `p` chance of the price in the future being greater than `price_future` then bitcoin is a good investment.
Given that $HIGH estimates are very high, our p is very small, and for me bitcoin has already taken hold enough to rule out that small failure risk.  Hence I conclude: good fundamentals.

"Recently someone transferred $6.5M in BTC for a fee of 6 cents."
That tells us what he's talking about by implication.  It's simply not possible to turn $6.5M into BTC, transfer, then back into $6.5M for 6 cents.  Therefore we're talking about $6.5M of _value_ in the form of BTC, not about a pile of dollar bills.
He even further plays fair by admitting that to end up with dollars, CoinBase and BitPay would charge 0.99% to transfer to a legacy bank account -- not 6 cents.

Bitcoin stops government from taking your wealth off you without your involvement; but make no mistake -- government is powerful enough to take off you by forcing your involvement.
While they can still lock you up, lock your family up, deprive your family of your presence, take your house off you, force you into bankruptcy, tie you up in court cases, and strap you to a chair and hit you with a $5 wrench -- your wealth is not safe.  Bitcoin or no.
There is a bit of plausibility deniability gained; so that's nice.

Your attack was "the early adopter is spending his gains", now you say "people are hoarding".  Make up your mind which is the complaint.
The truth is that people are not a homogenous whole.  Some are spending, some are saving.  Some savers will spend at price/time X and some will spend at price/time Y.  The market price is a reflection of that.
That many people are holding bitcoins now is exactly what we want -- bitcoins have to first become a store of value before they can be a medium of exchange.  The current price of bitcoin is a function of how much fiat people have converted to bitcoin.  That's what the price represents.
To put it another way: there are 12M bitcoins right now.  Let's say 90% of them are hoarded and 10% are circulating.  How is that different from there being 1.2M bitcoins now and 100% of them circulating?  Since the number of bitcoins in existence was an entirely arbitrary number, the two situations are (almost) identical.  The difference being that in this reality those hoarded 90% are what have given the 10% their value to make them useful for circulation.

Firstly: I did admit that it was only true on a strict cycle.
You've certainly opened my eyes to an alternative.
However, let's consider a day.  If bitcoin is operating correctly we can assume a block every ten minutes in that day.  Some will be early, some will be late.   Now sprinkle transactions randomly throughout the day.  The average time to next block must be 5 minutes.  If it's not, then there wasn't a block on average every ten minutes.


Your coin flip example is not directly comparable, since I'm not saying anything about when the last block was, and hence am not predicting the next one.  I'm simply saying that at any randomly chosen time, it must be (on average) five minutes until the next block appears.  I'm selecting a random time in the current period.
I'm reading about poisson processes now.  Fascinating.  Thank you very much.  (happy to be wrong, when it comes with an education).
Think I see my error, and I withdraw all I said -- you are completely correct.  I should not have been so lax as to use the "average blocks per day is ten" as if it were literally ten.  The distribution of "number of blocks per day" is itself a poisson distribution.  If a block takes 20 minutes, that doesn't mean that for the rest of the day we'll get slightly shorter block times (I see now where your coin flip example comes from), we must still expect one every ten minutes for the remaining time in the day.  That will result in there being slightly less or slightly more than the expected number.
Thank you again.

I think there are a few good reasons (and others have covered them), but I think the big one is as follows:
Bitcoin moves quickly, banks move slowly.
I mean quick and slow here in the business sense.  Just as small companies can, when they innovate, trample a big competitor that isn't innovating (perfect example is Google) because by the time the big competitor notices it's getting left behind, the fast moving small company is well ahead.
Bitcoin is, I believe, just the same.  It's small (relatively) market cap and large number of small entrepreneurs mean that it's basically stealthily spreading.
It's not worth any big players dedicating time to swat the fly yet.  I think their mistake is confusing the acorn with the oak tree.  Bitcoin is settling in, consolidating and becoming known in all the little nooks and crannies that big banks don't see.  Exactly as it's proponents expected.  I'd go so far as saying that we're getting to the point that fighting bitcoin now would be like trying to stab jelly to death.
I always worry that I'm overly optimistic, and getting caught up in the circle jerk, but bitcoin just seems to keep chipping away.

You've got it bang on the money, you just haven't followed through to the conclusion.


The fact that bitcoin deflation hurts some and rewards others creates two opposing sides.  That is classic negative feedback.  It is supply and demand writ large.


Even accepting what you say (and I think you're using the wrong exchange rate, you want Loaf/BTC).  What do you think the result will be in such a situation?  Bakers, butchers and candlestickmakers purposely destroying their finances?  No, it will result in them demanding higher prices.  Higher prices equals inflation, not deflation... ta da, a downward pressure.
The same is true in fact regardless of inflation/deflation rate, a balance will always be found.  So, we must use some other criteria to decide which is better.
 - Inflation: discourages saving, encourages consumption
 - Deflation: encourages saving, discourages consumption
You choose.

You're right that that's what gives fiat a _huge_ part of its value.  But let's say in the hypothetical case that bitcoin takes off and is being used in 90% of all transactions.  It won't be hard at all to buy massive quantities of fiat when your tax bill becomes due.
That will set up an exchange, and a rate, and we'll have an exact measure of the value that "only acceptable for tax liabilities" imparts.  It won't stop bitcoin from being valuable, or even dominating.

I'm glad to have your agreement.  I'm still wavering on it as a conclusion.  My problem is that accepting money is definitely a way of saying "I trust that society will exist sufficiently enough tomorrow that this abstraction of work I have done today will have value tomorrow" -- but I'm not sure if that still isn't a transaction.
What is money when you actually have it, it's not moving, you just own some?  Perhaps the amount of money you have is a representation of the degree to which you trust society.

Charts like this are always presented as if they are fact -- that all investments inevitably follow the same path.
Human beings are pattern recognition machines; we desperately want the new thing to be just like the old thing so that we can understand it. Wanting it doesn't make it so.
This is even more true with something like bitcoin, the like of which has never been seen before, and will likely never be seen again (in the sense that there can only be one "first" cryptocurrency).  This is, essentially, the mistake that most mainstream media makes when they report on it -- it must be a bubble, because any other investment with that sort of growth curve would be.

I'm not sure that that's so.  You're absolutely right that Bitcoin's M2 will be close to its M0; but that doesn't mean that bitcoin's M0 will equal USD's M0 in value.
If the current economy has create M2, M3 of a certain amount necessary to run itself, then bitcoin (with it's strict supply) must equal the value necessary to run the economy rather than the M0 USD needed to run that same economy when fractional reserve is in use.
In short: if the economy currently runs on an M3 of $100 trillion, then bitcoin has to be able of representing $100 trillion too.  Given that bitcoin's M2=M1=M0, then 21 million coins would have to value at $100 trillion.

Obviously the coins minted from sterling silver were literally silver; but that misses the point.  A "pound" represented 240 silver pennies.  People weren't carrying around a pound in weight to represent every pound-sterling they owned.  Very quickly the physical money got deposited with jewelers, who found that they could issue certificates of deposit to their customers -- that certificate was, of course, as good as the actual coinage, since the coinage could be claimed back on demand.  From them came the banks.
That's irrelevant though, what matters is that the pound-sterling was literally a weight of silver, regardless of its representation.  There was no way for a government to decouple, and should the government go bust, the silver was still silver.  That's why I said that "pound sterling" wasn't really a separate currency, it was just silver with a different name.


Of course it was.  It was backed by a commodity.

But the people who own them already will spend them, moving them to new owners; and they will also sell for fiat.
As bitcoin becomes more ubiquitous or won't be unreasonable to ask "can you change a bitcoin" just as you ask "can you change a 50". Local, private exchanges will dominate.
My point is the exchanges become less important at exactly the same time as the government's desire to regulate increases.

You're entirely correct.
I've always argued that from the point of view of the rest of the economy, unspent, hoarded, currency, is indistinguishable from that currency having never been created.  It can therefore be neither bad nor good for the economy.
What matters is only how much is circulating.  Given that the supply of Bitcoin is entirely an arbitrary number (Satoshi could have picked 200,000 blocks per halving; could have picked the initial block reward as 5000), it makes no difference how much is hoarded -- as it's indistinguishable from a universe with no hoarders and a different set of initial parameters.

Now; that being said, the low-friction of bitcoin makes it possible for vendors to offer discounts in bitcoins, _and_ for it to be potentially lower friction to purchase using your bitcoins.
All that adds up to make me think that in places where one can spend bitcoins _or_ dollars, you'll spend your dollars unless there is a discount for bitcoins.
More likely I think will be that the choice gets made by the supplier not the customer.  I can imagine companies that have trouble with card payment systems, paypal, and fraud will opt for accepting bitcoin exclusively.  That'll be an interesting time to see.

I didn't say anything about a flaw in bitcoin.  I comment only on your confusion of pseudonymous with anonymous.


I do not understand what you are describing here.  Simply moving money from one address to another doesn't help you, the new address is tied 100% to the old.
The point is this: money in via an exchange is tied to your real identity, you buy bitcoins with it.  You then move those coins to one or more bitcoin addresses -- let us pretend that the exchange records for those movements are secret -- however in truth your anonymity is already compromised.  Let's say 10 BTC on each.  You then use one of them to buy an ornament from Bitmit for 0.1BTC -- you must reveal your identity to receive delivery of that ornament.  The transaction that is made shows 10BTC in, 0.01BTC to the supplier and 9.99BTC in change.  The supplier therefore now knows the 10BTC address and the 9.99BTC address belong to your real identity.  Then you spend again.  Another 0.01BTC to a different supplier.  9.99BTC in, 0.01BTC + 9.98BTC out.  Another compromise, but worse, the original supplier can take a high-probability guess that the 9.98BTC address is yours.
This is all fairly well understood.  The "taint analysis" you see on Blockchain.info will even automate the task for you.
There is hope in the form of the new CoinJoin system for performing automatic anonymisation.  But the very fact that anonymisation is needed (and being worked on) should tell you that bitcoin is _not_ anonymous, it is (as I said two posts ago) pseudonymous.  You do yourself a disservice to not recognise that fact, because it is dangerous for your privacy.
However, I've done my duty as a bitcoin citizen by trying to inform you of the risk, you are welcome to ignore it.

This is nonsense.  The two models proposed in the article are:
Model 1 = pegged
No problem,  $INGAMECURRENCY = k * $BTC_DEPOSITED
Model 2 = not pegged


That's a floating rate, and doesn't fit the word "pegged" in the slightest.
Conclusion: amazingly the way to "peg" a currency is just to make it a proxy for that currency by some constant multiplying factor.
Your worry as a user should be that the central bank of in game currency will feel perfectly justified in fiddling with that "constant" factor for their own benefit over time.
If you really must have an in game currency with real world value, then a floating rate is slightly better.  But why not just use bitcoins?

That's not intrinsic value.  That's value because a set of industries in the world have a desire and use for gold.  Fundamentally, it is that gold has a set of properties that make it desirable in a set of contexts.  Not all contexts though, and hence there is nothing intrinsic about its value.
Answer this -- you are on day three of an exile in the centre of a desert.  I turn up in my helicopter and offer you the choice of the equivalent weight of water or gold.  If gold had intrinsic value, you would still prefer it to the water.  You would not.
Bitcoins are no different; they have a set of properties that make it useful in certain contexts.  It is those properties in those contexts that give it value.  That value is just as real as the value of gold.

Agreed, I'm not advocating either way.  I was simply observing that paying someone to securely store your bitcoins (i.e. a negative interest rate) is not unreasonable.

You're claiming predictive skill because you happened to bet on the right number on a roulette wheel.  But you only dance around being right _after_ the wheel has spun. _That's_ the hindsight I'm referring to.
Your current claim is that one or other of these charts has predictive skill.  My response is that I want to see it -- predict away.  Pick either one you like, and put some prices and times on one.  We'll meet back here whenever you like and compare the reality against your chart.

Of course -- I'm certainly not saying "that's it, they're done" -- but if you don't trust blockchain to keep your records safe (or rather, non-existent), then nothing stops them from monitoring inputs and outputs even if they weren't the CoinJoin provider.  A couple of extra lines of javascript, and blockchain knows all your bitcoin addresses (kept on their wallet) anyway, whether you use CoinJoin or any other mixer.
The same, incidentally, will be true of any mixing service.  Some software will be written that offers the CoinJoin -- in that case you trust that; even if it's peer-to-peer.

For SEPA transfers (and I guess all the other bank transfers) the receiving exchange gets a lot of information about the sending bank on their bank statement.  Obviously even more is needed to transfer money out since you have to fully describe where it's going.
The sending bank won't have issued an account without knowing all about their customer (else they really would be in trouble with the gov).  Therefore, if an investigator ever came knocking on the exchange's door it should be enough to simply show them a copy of the sending bank details and they can go back to their traditional methods for tracking down money launderers.
In short: exchanges _don't_ need any of this shit (for certain categories of transfer); your identity is _already_ sufficiently known to them for any government agency that comes calling.  That they are being made to gather it is a way of forcing them into the "you will be assimilated" part of the financial world.

A deflating economy is not the same as a deflating currency.  In a growth economy, a deflationary currency (or rather a neutral currency in the case of bitcoin) transfers the benefits of that economic growth to the holders of the currency -- i.e. the people.
Growth is a product of all its members cooperating; it seems exactly right that everyone share in the proceeds of that growth in the form of lower prices, and more valuable savings.  Similarly, if society makes a loss, your money becomes less valuable -- so be it, manipulating a currency to hide that loss (as countries are finding out about QE).
People will still borrow a deflationary currency if they have a use for it that earns more than deflation.  Since we're talking about bitcoin, it is a neutral currency, so in fact you simply need any profitable use and you are ahead.  I honestly can't get that worked up about the idea that people will be discouraged from borrowing to invest in enterprises that don't exceed inflation, but are greater than 0%, as they do now.

None at all.  It _is_ a bubble.
All currencies are a "bubble" in that sense though.  They don't represent ownership of anything other than themselves.  Even gold is only valuable because its gold.
The only thing giving them value is the trust that a supplier will consider them as valuable as you do.  While that holds the bubble doesn't pop.
It's worth noting that historically, every fiat currency has eventually popped.
You should evaluate bitcoin in exactly this context.  The value of bitcoin is the utility it gives you; the more users there are of it, the more valuable that utility is.

With fiat, you have no clue how much they'll print, when they'll print it, and who the printed money will be given to.

A downward pressure on bitcoin price isn't a bad thing. There is always a downward pressure. It's what the upward pressure pushes against to establish price. A different price doesn't alter bitcoins utility, market penetration alters bitcoin utility so more users is better than higher prices.

Your example is against intrinsic value. The fact that water is valuable in a desert does not make water intrinsically valuable. If it was intrinsic you wouldn't need to bring the desert into it at all.  Further, it would be the same value everywhere to everyone. To a man with a water tower full of water, your jug is worthless. Literally worth nothing to him. Intrinsic value of water is therefore 0
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:02:23


Exactly.  Do you know what subjective means?  It means that the context matters...


How is the gold more valuable when viewed objectively?  You simply stating your assertion isn't an argument.
There is no objective view of the value of anything.  Value is imputed by agreeing a price between buyer and seller.  In the gold-in-the-desert case, gold is worth less than water.  What on earth does "intrinsic" mean if it doesn't mean immutable?  The value of the gold is nothing when there is no one to trade it with.  You would sell your bar of gold for a glass of water or a meal if you were thirsty or hungry.


I don't care about value either.  I'm arguing that there is no intrinsic value and it therefore isn't in gold.


I think the problem is what you're choosing to define as "intrinsic".  Gold certainly has properties that are intrinsic, just as bitcoin does.  The utility of those properties is certainly subjective though and therefore there is no intrinsic value; only intrinsic properties.


Nonsense.  We're talking about Bitcoin the specific implementation, not Bitcoin-the-technology.  Bitcoins that started from a different genesis block are not the same thing by any means.


What else gives gold its value?  Gold that nobody else on the planet wanted would be worthless.

I'm afraid gum gum is correct. The might well be reasonable, but the BBC are not. The BBC have meetings to decide their editorial stance on new topics (they did so with climate change and Jimmy Saville for example) and will then report and question from that stance from then on.

"speculative markets crash"
That's a statement given as if it is fact.  It is not.  Everything has a beginning, and at that point is speculative.  It is an outright lie to say that every single speculative market ever has crashed.
Since the premise is false, the conclusions that follow are not proven.  "So will bitcoin" is therefore just an opinion masquerading as wisdom.

If that made up "true potential" crap at the end had been left off that would have been a nice little video.

I'm afraid that two things are either correlated or uncorrelated -- there is no direction.  Hence I can say: lack of correlation between A and B means no correlation between B and A -- by definition.
I think you're confusing it with correlation is not causation.  Just because A causes B, does not mean that B causes A.  That's not the point I'm making.  However, correlation is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for causation, so if we can demonstrate no correlation (which we can), then we know that there is no causation.
Hence: if we can show places where there is government and yet there is still a breakdown of what we consider moral, reasonable behaviour, then we absolutely can conclude that government is not the cause of that behaviour -- it is irrelevant.  From there, it's perfectly reasonable to say that anyone who brings up Somalia as if it is an argument that no tax and regulation results in raping and pillaging is demonstrably wrong.


I'm not suggesting we take any of the societies from the last 2000 years.  By any modern standard they were (for the most part) barbaric.  Perhaps humanity needed government to get where we are now.  I would argue that we remove taxation and regulation from this society that we have now.  Government has served its time and is now too big and too unwieldy.  It is now actively damaging the society it may once have served.
I have no wish to "find flaws and formulate your arguments against it" here.  I piped up merely to address your flawed use of Somalia as evidence against a libertarian state.  Somalia is by no stretch of the imagination a libertarian state.

Let's say I'm anonymous; my identity is unknown.  I perform action A then I perform action B.  There is no way to know that I, a single individual, performed both of these actions.
Let's say I'm pseudonymous; my real identity is unknown, but I have a pseudonym... kingofthejaffacakes.  I perform action A, then I perform action B.  While an external observer doesn't know my real world identity, they do know that kingofthejaffacakes performed both these actions.
Satoshi and bitcoin are both pseudonymous -- bitcoin trails exist, and can be tracked transaction to transaction.  There is no way (within bitcoin) to know what identity matches up to a particular pseudonym (which are the addresses in bitcoin), but we can all see what a particular pseudonym did.
Pseudonymity has the disadvantage that if you can attach an identity to any of the actions, you have attached it to all of them.
TLDR; it's perfectly reasonable to describe Satoshi and bitcoin both as pseudonymous.

Fortunately, like BitTorrent, by the time Bitcoin is big enough to get the attention of the slow-moving fiat world, it will be too big to be stopped.
The main weak points are, of course, the exchanges, as they are centralised points that governments are very good at beating up with their justice departments.  Provided bitcoins have dispersed sufficiently by then, it really won't matter.

You're absolutely right.
If I pass one bitcoin around a billion times that's a GDP of a billion bitcoins.
That bitcoin wasn't worth a billion bitcoins though (how could it be).  GDP therefore has nothing to do with the value of the currency used to measure it.

You're right that everyone has a price, but you aren't thinking it through.  If a bitcoin was worth $1,000,000, then it would be because I could buy $1m worth of "stuff" with each one.  Why would I bother exchanging them for $1,000,000, with which I can buy.... wait for it ... $1m worth of stuff?

That's a separate question.  How can I know the answer to that?  The price may change, the market may shrink; but those are separate issues -- and only those with functional crystal balls know the answer -- anything I said about them would be opinion.  It is not opinion to say that bitcoin itself _cannot_ be controlled though.
The article argued that bitcoin will inevitably end up stored in bitcoin banks, and will be governmentally controlled.  I'm simply countering that to say that bitcoin can never be fundamentally controlled while I am able to act without a bank and without a government -- and I always am.

The password to my encrypted bitcoins can be willed to whomever I like.  Conversely: what do I care, when I'm dead, that they are lost?
You might not have said "certificate", but very few people who "own" gold actually have possession of it.  What they own is a claim on some gold from a third party.  And then it's [at risk](  Even if you really do have possession of your gold; I should be interested to know what happens to your "lasts forever" gold when you [take it across a border]( and I should be interested to know how you're securing your physical gold (not literally, obviously, I don't need to know the combination to your safe) in a way that makes it more secure than my encrypted bitcoins.
As I said, I'm not anti-gold; but nor am I blind to its drawbacks.  Similarly for bitcoin -- it has both positives and negatives.  It is the awareness of both those positives and negatives that lets each of us choose the method of value storage appropriate for ourselves (perhaps a bit of both).  That's far better than your stated position of "If you just wanted to buy and hold you could get gold," which makes it seem that you think gold has no negatives relative to bitcoin.

You shouldn't look at volume bought/sold.  You should look on the exchanges at volume _for_ sale, and volume bid.  Those have definitely increased massively since last month.
The fact that there are no actual buys or sells means that, for the moment, all the holders think the price is just below their valuation, and the bidders all think the price is just above their valuation.  In other words: "right".

Then your memory is faulty.  There was as much, if not more, euphoria.  People were posting about how they would buy islands.

It's not decentralised unless you've gone to the trouble of storing it yourself; and gold certificates don't count as gold.  It's not cross-border because you can't actually move it (see how far you get trying to carry a brick of gold through customs).
I'm not trying to persuade you that gold is bad -- both bitcoin and gold share a lot of very positive qualities.  I can't carry my gold around on my mobile phone though, and I can't beam gold over the internet as easily as I can beam it across the room.  Nor can I easily sub-divide gold, or do any reasonable accounting with it.

Honestly, ripple isn't anything at the moment.  But if it gets going, then it's a complementary technology.  Ripple is essentially an IOU transfer system.  Those IOUs will be particularly useful if they are denominated in Bitcoins.

The problem is you can create contracts with the swipe of a pen, you cannot create tulip bulbs.  Of course more contracts can be traded in a day than there is coffee that day -- that's the point of a contract.  There has to be enough to satisfy all the contracts in the end though.  Nothing stops me writing a contract that promises I can deliver you a thousand tonnes of tulips.  I can't of course, but nothing stops me writing the contract and selling it.  When that contract turns out to be bogus, come crop time, would anyone be surprised at a complete collapse of the price of tulip contracts?  Of course I'll be sued, but that doesn't create tulips either.
I don't say that contracts are bad; simply that direct comparison with the tulipmania bubble and bitcoin's growth are not that clear cut.  If you buy a bitcoin, you really have a bitcoin.

I'll answer my own question, since no one else seems to have done so.
There is one fundamental difference between gambling and investment.  In gambling the [expected value]( of any position is guaranteed to be less than or equal to one.  For investment, there is no such guarantee -- it is _possible_ (only possible) that a position can have an expected value greater than one.
In other words: in investment, there is no house margin.  There is at least the possibility that everybody wins.
@_date: 2013-04-05 12:58:30
Yeah!  Exactly, how many times must bitcoin fall to its certain death, and be splattered all over the rocks before people realise that _this_ time its the end.
... tick, tick, tick ...
Oh damnit... well, next time will definitely be the end.
Why does no one understand the metaphor of "the bubble"?  It's pretty simple, toddlers understand that bubbles don't come back after they've popped.  
Logical conclusion: if it "bounces back" it wasn't a bubble.
Therefore: total bitcoin bubbles to date... 0
Total possible bitcoin bubbles over all time ... 1

I understand that.  Isn't that my point?  You want access to the wallet I host elsewhere?


That's lovely, but hardly relevant.  I'm not objecting on the grounds that "all software should be open source"; I'm objecting on the grounds that "all software that accesses my bitcoin wallet should be open source".  Even the main bitcoind reference design has had a few bugs that were scary -- why on Earth wouldn't the same be true of your software?
Further; given the recent NSA revelations, I find it even less acceptable now for commercial companies to hide cryptography under the veil of "commercial sensitivity".


Oh well; as long as you are recommending that I use somebody else's service in a way that means you couldn't steal a lot of money from me, that's okay. /s  Also: what business is it of yours how much money I store in an online wallet?  What if my skepticism is such that I trust the open sourced, privacy-protecting, implementation of blockchain, but not you?  "You recommend" do you?  You take a lot of liberties with what you recommend.
Even if you were trustworthy in the sense that you weren't ever going to steal coins; having full access to a wallet means you can see all my addresses, and all the transactions I ever made on those addresses.  Why would I want you to have access to that information?  How do I know you aren't forwarding that information to a government agency?
Even blockchain, the people hosting my wallet, don't get to see what you're asking to see.

Governments [will start minting them](  Unfortunately people seem to trust governments.
