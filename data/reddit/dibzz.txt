The problem with that explanation is that the bitcoins themselves don't move - they ARE the limited spaces that make up the ledger. 
I visualize it like this...
Imagine if all the bitcoins in existence where depicted as lockers on a wall.  Each bitcoin "locker" has a lock on it which represents the private key.  Using the private key allow a person to place a new lock on that bitcoin, or divide the locker up and place a new lock on a one of the new divisions.
The public key let's other people request that "your" lock provided so they can place it on a locker they currently have one of their own locks on...
meh. I just reread this and it's confusing as hell. made sense in my own head though. screw it.

Yes, if the severity of my sentence was being based primarily on an allegation separate from the crime I was on trial for I would want the ability to defend myself on that charge.

If they could prove that than why did they not bring that charge against him?

You’re right, I should have left out the word “primarily”

I guess it goes to show that they can screw you for an alleged crime without ever actually giving you a chance to fight it in court. Keep in mind he was never charged or convicted of anything related to that. You would think if they truly had that on him they would have charged him with it.

The judge didn’t take that allegation into account when sentencing him on the other charges?

Good call. You were right. Math wins again!

Your welcome! But how do you know I'm not a random internet girl or a really smart squirrel that knows how to type?

GDAX doesn't charge a network fee to withdrawl crypto. Coinbase does however. So if you have crypto in your Coinbase wallet you should transfer it to to your GDAX account and withdrawl it to an external wallet from there.

reluctant to give or spend; stingy; miserly.
meanly or ungenerously small or scanty: a niggardly tip to a waiter.

I got five on it, partner let's go half on a sack.

It's really not that complicated.  In USD we have dollars AND cents.  
In response to your stock reference, if Buffet wanted to make the stock appear to , he could simply split the shares in half and volia', each share is only $88,500/share.

I'm giving family members paper wallets with some bitcoin loaded in each.

Although money people might get confused at first, in the end it's worth it.

I hear that too. Just goes to show how little people really know about money. The US dollar hasn't been backed by gold since Nixon was in office and dropped the gold standard. We just use a private institution (The FED) to secretly print up cash on demand now. Need a trillion? No worries, we should have enough paper and ink in stock to cover that.
