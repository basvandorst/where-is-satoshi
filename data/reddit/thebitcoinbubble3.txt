No, the DCA performed the same as my example: -21.66%

Lol @ the video promoting bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme
Also 'make Bitcoins from visiting websites'.. Pfft.. What, 0.0000001 BTC per visit?

After examination there indeed appears to be an error in one of the spreadsheets.
If you dollar cost average, it is -21.66%, but if you average Bitcoins, then it should be a worse total of -25.23%.
jratcliffe's spreadsheet also affirms that -21.66% is correct for the dollar cost average calculation.
I cannot find the error in either the other columns or the above rows. For instance, the first row should be -50.71% by my calculations. Why the total for the percentage column is wrong eludes me. I have merely used a formula to average the values in the above rows.
Regardless, I don't believe it makes any difference to my central point, which is that dollar cost averaging is merely chasing losses. If you have invested over these past few months using a weekly or even daily dollar cost average method (as jratcliffes spreadsheet has shown), then you are currently down ~21-22%. And thats with the price being at $520 rather than the much more dire $340 which is bound to be revisited. Additionally you would now have a lot more on the line than if you had simply invested one small amount first up and let yourself lose ~60% of it. So my point here is that you should never dollar cost average as a way to reduce or make up for losses.
