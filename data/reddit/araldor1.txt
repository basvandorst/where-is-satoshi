Yeah but I have a feeling once bitcoin becomes  it will spiral down out of control

Have you read the Iota whitepapers? When it comes to its scalability it's only really affected by bandwidth between each node. It runs on the tangle which works different to the blockchain. In relation to the initial comment ANY coin overtaking btc I think will have an affect on all the get rich quick investors whos brother friend told them it's the future. These people have hugely inflated the price recently. I'm currently writing a paper on this at the moment and will post it when ive finished if you fancy reading it (end of feb or so). It'll boost my readership from 0 to 1 ����

Ins't this just the equivalent of scroll past the first 100 coins on coinmarketcap though? Plenty of worthless crypto knocking about these days as well...

It's a pretty good job it has as well. Otherwise the 0.1% would just keep their coins in a vault never to be seen by anyone else. If keeping the cash isn't good for the individuals they will go ahead and find somewhere else to keep their wealth (Usually invested into something). Not saying that everyone investing into positive things but it's better invested than sat in some high security cellar never to see the light of day.

Are you referring to the 1996 (might be a different year im not sure) agreement? If you are could you please give me a source on the substantial increase in firearm involved homicide rate increase?

Depends how high up you are? Some senior directors make well in excess of that per year.

It's was 5 donations of 4 BTC over about 4 hours and this was at the end. There are more clips of the donos being sent and he was buzzing. Transaction went through a third party donation system so it's an expensive prank if it is from the tax man
@_date: 2019-01-13 14:18:17
He didn't think it was real. He might Usually get a few 100 in a day so this was kinda random. Usually on twitch people somehow fake donations (usually PayPal) so he was cautious to go mental and look like an idiot.
@_date: 2019-01-13 21:28:43
 
You can see the transactions on his streamlabs page. Tons of streamers use it as a way for viewers to donate. Obviously there is some chance that he sent himself the money from a random account but faking it might not be a good idea for someone who has to go and declare there income so i'd think it unlikely.

Pretty sure almost all the top earning streamers are fellas. Not sure though could be wrong.
@_date: 2019-01-13 15:04:30
Or just real life when the tax man turns up

@_date: 2019-01-13 14:14:32
It was 4 bitcoin donations 5 times... Maybe a stolen wallet? But I guess you'd send it yourself if it was haha
Maybe they sold that pizza all those years ago and still have some left? ����

5 donations each 4 bitcoins over the day. Pretty crazy ��
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:14:46
Works fine for me on Android, I have the twitch app though so it opens in that.
@_date: 2019-01-13 19:44:55
It happened over about 5 hours in separate donations. This was towards the end once all the donations had come in.
@_date: 2019-01-13 12:47:50
Usually when I donation like this happens on Paypal it's a fake donation and the fee is refunded. Obviously with Bitcoin this isn't an issue. 
Pretty cool either way. I wish someone would send me 20 BTC.
@_date: 2019-01-14 12:53:48
At the time of the donation is was about 73k which is a meme in the oldschool RuneScape community.

I didn't see it, tried to go back a bit and gave up. Cry me a river though.
@_date: 2019-01-13 23:49:52
Because I'd love 20 btc?

Can confirm I spent fiat money today and it still has value. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:25:49
Maybe he sold all his bitcoins to get that car in January... Uh oh.
