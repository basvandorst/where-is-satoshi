If Bitcoin hits $10,000 before the end of the year, I'll be a bottom.
edit: fuck, who's got the lube?

Nothing makes me more nervous than when people are celebrating.

Gotta love how every mainstream mention of Bitcoin has to suffix their mention with what Bitcoin even is.

All I'm saying is mountains are followed by valleys. Rises are followed by dips. Bulls are chased by bears. To think there will never be another dip would be reckless and idiotic. There is something to be learned from studying trends in Bitcoin. It's PREDICTIVE, not indicative. Expect a dip in the near future, or lose your gains.

Very true, no FDIC for Bitcoin though. Apparently, the FDIC in the U.S. was only established in 1933, so the concept of insuring bank holdings (up to $250,000) is a relatively newer concept.

Just remember, if you don't have access to the key, they aren't your coins. It's sort of analogous to having your money in the bank versus in the pocket. If the bank gets robbed (or bank robs you), you're shit outta luck. Bitcoin is about freedom from institutions. Coinbase is an institution.

I think the trap you fell into there is saying there is saying that Bitcoin exchanges "credit" to a customer's account. My analogy to banks is exactly the same. The money a bank says you own isn't yours until you withdraw it (either manually or through credit). Otherwise, it's just a number on a spreadsheet. When you have your own private key, its as good as holding cash. When your bitcoin is in an exchange, it's the same as trusting a bank to disperse your funds should you ever initiate a transaction. If you buy/sell through Coinbase, they are making the trade, not you.

That's a good idea.

lol, that's way too broad for the question I'm asking specifically about Coinbase. Is there any reason to keep Bitcoin in Coinbase if what results after a UAHF is inaccessible? Is my thinking flawed in believing theres a benefit to having two forms of cryptocurrency?

this is the correct answer. He used Bitcoin as a currency before exchanges, essentially pioneering the first price of Bitcoin by assigning a known value to fixed quantity.

Thanks for the tip. I guess I like the convenience of being able to see "my" assets laid out for my simple mind. For some reason, I'm under the impression a physical wallet won't show me basic information, and transferring to a wallet will be very expensive. Based on what's come up in the last hour, confirming BIP 91 makes my original question irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:36:56
Yeah, the problem is I don't know what I'm talking about, so I don't know what to search for. Can you point me in the direction of something actually helpful?
