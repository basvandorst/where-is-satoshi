BTC ... BCH... the goal of crypto is to be free to do whatever you want. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash supporters are like 2 retarded kids fighting each other to tell they are the best... I hold both because I believe in people freedom and if some people want to fork bitcoin to do their own bitcoin and it works, good for them. The whole crypto space work on offer and demand, if there is demand, it means their is an interest. So stop bitching people interests and let everyone be free. I’m not supporter of either BCH or BTC, but both subreddit and are full of stupid people claiming they have the best bitcoin.... grow up guys !

I wouldn't say that it is UI problem. It is UX problem. 
People should be able to use it without knowing anything about it.
The cryptospace is already complex for most people not involved into it. LN add just a layer of complexity that is unnecessary and may slow down adoption.

Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are both BS for different reasons
The first one cannot admit that their technology will not work on a large scale (Let's try to explain to your grand mother how to open a channel on LN). The second one to try to steal the branding with kind of a CEO at the top (Roger Ver) which is the opposite of decentralisation. 
At the end, it's all about the name, because Bitcoin is easily surpassed by many altcoins about the scalibility and the possibility of uses.
