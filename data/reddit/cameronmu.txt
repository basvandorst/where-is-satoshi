I doubt it there is enough hodlers ��
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:15:04
From what I see. The price is holding well just now. Once there is a more reliable platform for traders we should see a price jump. But if you are a hodler this shouldn’t matter to you?

No shit my landlord heard I was looking into “alternative investments” he asked me down to his shop today and handed me this book. Wtf? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:55:22
That wasn’t my point sorry. I was just pointing out that the number of bit coin held would hopefully prevent the price dropping. As in the people not willing to sell would prevent a mass of transactions at a smaller unit price. If that helps?

I went 50/50 on BTC and LTC both climbed at the same rate until LTC went for a run to €300 ��
I’m thinking of cashing out of BTC when it hits 25k and putting it to LTC for the foreseeable future.

It’s funny because he can’t.

I’m just wondering. The company I hold any crypto with could be based in several tax havens. So if I’m not in my country and the “exchange” isn’t in my country and then the company I use to turn BTC into what ever currency I need at that time are in a different country. Well who do I pay tax to? And I’m already paying tax on the goods I am buying which should then go to there government. Is it just me or are they just greedy?
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:51:17
I physically felt that! Like WOW

I’m not too knowledgable about server rooting and WiFi my self but the article did make me think a bit deeper. Shame you have to learn all this stuff for your self unless you are going to make it a career.

So basically money laundering?
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:45:37
The only way it would be counter productive is if you sold your bitcoin an hodled fiat. 
Buying and selling is what pushes the “exchange rate” higher. Each time someone interacts with the block chain signals more demand on the public ledger.
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:39:38
@_date: 2019-09-06 22:59:02
The problem here is you are looking at currencies in alternative value. 
A dollar = A dollar
A pound a pound
And a yuan a yuan
One Bitcoin is one Bitcoin and it is only when you need to use this Bitcoin out with the perimeters of crypto that you then need to have an exchange rate.
@_date: 2019-09-29 23:04:52
It’s not. I bought it new but the packaging wasn’t the best so it got a little beat in the post.

I read an article the other day about using public WiFi and how most of the time your log in details are pretty easy to skim off while waiting on servers etc. Just a thought?

The hard part is going to be around 18k. Do you sell and hope for a retreat then re-buy? It’s not going to be easy because I can see it hitting 12,13,17k pretty quick. It’s then going to be people shitting out that will draw the price back before it goes 30-40k? What’s a man todo?
