Oh but everything is deregulated, meaning that someone taking a loan can just fuck off with the money. You are going to pay a hell of a lot more interest than that to cover the losses for when people do just that.
That's probably why you aren't going to find anyone offering bitcoin loans today.

I would not call Forex trading investing.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:20:19
I would argue that bitcoin doesn't *generate* value. When you buy a stock/bond, that money/portion of the company is put to use generating revenue and improving its value. When you buy Bitcoin, no value gets generated. It just sits there, nothing is created or made.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:57:55
And guess what all those items are priced in? Government-issued currencies.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:39:23


Yes and I would advise against using a currency as an investment and instead use it as a storage of wealth, something they do well due to their stability and ease of use. Things Bitcoin lacks.


Companies issue stocks as a means of gathering investment capital. Investment capital created expansion and improvement which increases return and value. Workers can not generate value on their own without capital and they certainly can't increase it without it.

A stock represents a percentage ownership in a company. That includes the assets of the company and those most certainly do generate revenue. If the company is generating revenue, your percentage ownership in the company is generating revenue. Trading stock around is representative of the different speculations on how much that percentage is worth and how much it will be worth.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:59:17
Yes, which it's supposed to do and what you want it to do as a currency. Nobody is claiming fiat currency is an investment because it's a not. Are you arguing Bitcoin is a currency or an investment?

Forex doesnt represent the majority of currency holders. It does for cryptos.

Literally everyone outside the echo chamber was saying this.

The crime is undeclared income. As a part of a tax-based government and society, you are expected to pay a certain portion of you gains and income back to society. You are no "entitled" to making money without declaring it as income. You don't have a right to avoid your taxes. The money laundering comes in when they can prove that you spent that stolen cash without declaring it. If it was all stashed away and unspent, then no money laundering would occur.
@_date: 2014-04-30 01:51:51
That sure is a lovely and I'm sure a well thought out and factually backed generalization of all government spending. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 02:49:22
When did I say the government doing that is okay? I still find the killing of citizens to be horrible and I would support those in charge of said deaths facing trial. I have no problem speaking out against those injustices, OJ's injustice, and the injustice of those who feel tax evasion is okay because others can get away with it.
@_date: 2014-04-30 01:48:18
So does that make it okay now? Pointing out that someone else got/getting away with it doesn't mean that now it's okay and you should be allowed to get away with it too.
@_date: 2014-04-30 02:02:52
Slavery implies you have no representation which you do since you do have the right to vote. Unfortunately taxation is necessary for any government to work. Our society has determined that that taxation is best done mostly through income tax with a small sales tax. There are indeed countries that do have[ zero income tax]( if those suit your fancy. Since you have the ability to freely leave your current taxation situation through immigration, you aren't a slave tied to the US's tax system. If you find it not to your liking, there are other alternatives whether it's changing that system or leaving it.
@_date: 2014-04-30 01:33:57
No because you belong to and benefit from a tax-based government and society. I don't care what you are buying, I just wished it was taxed.

I expected when I began, but I still felt the dissenting viewpoint had to be said. I refuse to be silenced by an echo-chamber. I will admit that the results were better than expected,  I wasn't completely buried by the voters (at least not yet). I got more downvotes from saying I disliked Jamie Lanister :P
@_date: 2014-04-30 03:51:14
Yes I know the federal budget is available. To claim that 99% of all of that is "wasted or actively destructive" is an absurd hyperbole. 
Sure there are ways I wish it would be redistributed, but I do no think that it is all destructive or a waste. I'm fine with the $302 billion over the next 4 years for road, bridge, and railroad infrastructure maintenance and improvements. I also agree with the $14 billion for air, maritime, rail safety, and pipeline 
and hazardous material transportation safety regulation enforcement. Although I wish it would be higher, the $17.5 billion to NASA and $7.3 billion to the National Science Foundation is a step in the right direction. The $7.9 billion to the EPA seems appropriate to me and I like having healthy air and environment. The $4.5 billion to the Army Corps of Engineers is well spent. They do a lot to help with public infrastructure and maintenance. $65.3 billion to the department of veteran affairs is great. The do a lot to treat veterans hurt in combat and who struggle to adapt back into civilian life. The Department of the Treasury is getting $65.3 billion. They are helping to implement the Affordable Care Act which I support and also help enforce the Consumer Protection Act and Wall Street reform. 
Sure I hate that the Department of Defense gets $495.6 billion. Like most redditors I think that that is far too much, but I won't throw out the entire budget and claim that 99% of government spending is  wasteful or harmful. The government does manage to do a lot of good and we need to work to fix what is bad. No need to dismiss the entire system because of that.

Quality investments don't require proselytizing, ponzi schemes do. A quality investment will stand on its own.

How much have you personally invested, financially, in bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:09:08
What is your top and bottom for selling?
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:59:09
It's funny that you can see the value of magic beans falling with each of your transactions getting cheaper and cheaper. 
You need the price of magic beans to rise back up above 208.88 to break even and that's not taking into account the fees and the inability to sell that much at market price. At the moment you have already lost $7.5k from your initial purchase. You are down 18% from your initial investment in less than a day.
I hope you didn't take out a mortgage or loan for this because you probably just pissed away a good chunk of that $40k. This is gambling, plain and simple. I think the OP and some of the people on this subreddit have a gambling addiction and the subreddit itself is only fueling it.
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:46:51
So what your saying is you don't like people disagreeing with you, so you want to make your own echo chamber free from criticism and dissent?

Na, we like Bitstamp because we hope that it will teach you the value of regulatory oversight and financial institutions. The same lesson we hoped you would learn after Mt. Gox.

Judging by the price falling, you tipped far less than a $1.00 to everyone.

Cars have far higher interest rates than mortgages to make up for the risk. Mortgages never had that high of an interest comparatively. Also repossessing cars and reselling is far easier than evictions and selling foreclosed houses.

@_date: 2019-01-08 00:53:59
Dumping USD for cryprocurrency sounds like an awful choice because when that power/internet goes out for an extended time, you no longer have anything to barter with. You could be a multi-millionaire in crypto but the power/internet goes out and you're left destitute with nothing. You would liquidate into assets that would help you survive (non-perishable food, water filter system, energy cells, clothing, etc.) or things you can barter with (alcohol, cigarettes, chocolate, etc.). If we are at the point where the USD, the strongest currency backed by the strongest economy is collapsing, there isn't any outside economy where your crypto can continue to exist. This isn't just a single economy melting down, it's the world's economy. It may take years or decades to return to any amount of normalcy and at that point your crypto storage could degrade into being unusable or the world just might not use your crypto anymore and it's worthless.
If you are worried by an economic meltdown, invest in things that will actually help you survive that meltdown. A lifetime of savings converted into crypto means nothing if you're dead. Survival is always priority, especially when you don't know how bad things are going to get and for how long.
@_date: 2019-01-08 02:32:34

[Men with a bachelor's degree earn an average of $660k more than those with just a highschool diploma over their lifetime after controlling for socio-demographic variables, $450k for women.](
[Average student loan debt for the Class of 2016 was $37,172 per person.](
[People with a bachelor's degree have an unemployment rate of 2.5% vs 4.6% for high school graduates.](
[The gap between the highschool graduate and bachelor degree earning has been widening since the 1970s.](
$37k in debt for $660k more over your lifetime on top of a lower unemployment rate and an increasing disparity between highschool degree and bachelor degree wages. Yes, it continues to have positive returns.

This is ignorant of how student loans work. You cant default on a student loan like you can a mortgage and degrees continue to have positive returns so theres no bubble to burst
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:18:09
Because you can leverage debt to increase future returns. 
"Oh I got a job 30 miles away but I don't have a car. If I take out a loan, I can purchase a car now and use that car to get to work where I'll make more than I will pay the bank."
Can you seriously not imagine how taking on debt is a good idea? 
@_date: 2015-04-20 18:06:43
You will get some minor spikes in sales in the short term, but that will die down very quickly. Then you will see next to no sales with bitcoin. You may decide to stop taking bitcoin eventually and then all hell is going to open up once word gets out that you, a merchant, has disrespected their holy grail of currencies. You will get harassed with threats and worse for no longer taking a currency that nobody uses to buy from you anymore. It's a tale that has been repeated many times before.  I hope you know what you are getting into.
@_date: 2015-04-20 19:27:18
Usually by switching to somebody who gives them a better cut and also happens to not take bitcoin like the old one did. Since bitcoins don't make up much of their revenue, they don't mind dropping it. With bitcoin also comes a lot of pen-testers who try to get at that bitcoin because they know it's a lot less likely to get caught with stolen bitcoins so I hope it's pretty secure.

The FDIC is insurance against fraud and theft that banks pay to have.  for their customers. Something they pay for through their primary form of income: loan interest. Nothing is being "conjured up". Do you not understand how insurance works? [Per the Wikipedia article]( it doesn't even receive funds from the government and instead funds itself.  
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:50:00
This largely happened in Russia so it would be the Ruble and if it did affect someone in the US, the FDIC would reimburse each account that was robbed by up to $250,000.
