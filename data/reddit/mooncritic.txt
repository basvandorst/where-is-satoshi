The notes at [publicnote.com]( are fun because if you reach the wrong answer, there might be clues left by the organizer or other players at the note for the wrong answer. You can also leave notes there.

If you scan the QR code using a QR code scanning app, does the first letter of the text result start with "5" or "L" or "K"?

I solved it! Will update this comment shortly with my solution. Thank you for the fun puzzle. :)
Edited to discuss solution:
I decrypted "1FXYAEwj2Ckm5EdWnGPEPg==" with AES. Since "publicnote" was the secret for the wallets, I tried that and sure enough it gave me the value of "Hal".
I tried entering in "Hal" and the clue there led me to a HAL 9000 references which turned out to be a dead end. I thought of Hal Finney because of his impact in cryptocurrency, so I gave that a shot and there was a clue "Wise words from a wise man" after "RIP...".
I tried a number of the quotes that Hal Finney is known for, starting with the "Since we're all rich with bitcoins". After a few more tries, I finally found the solution which was "The danger is if people are buying bitcoins in the expectation that the price will go up, and the resulting increased demand is what is driving the price up. That is the definition of a BUBBLE, and as we all know, bubbles burst."
There I was greeted with a "YAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!!!" and the private key.

Can you tell us more about what happened? Who did they call, where did they get the phone number? What was the phone number? What information did they give over the phone?

You can use any bitcoin wallet where you can import or sweep private keys.
