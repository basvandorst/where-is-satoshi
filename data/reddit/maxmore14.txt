I see several questions and comments about the cost of being cryopreserved. I've known Hal for over 20 years and today was both sad and happy to help cryopreserve him. Hal was always a guy who wanted to know the facts, so please take a look at alcor.org. Cryopreservation is much more affordable than most people think. Membership dues (which are now going down, due to economies of scale) are affordable to anyone who can manage a Starbucks coffee a few times per week. The $80,000 for a neuro preservation, or $200,000 for whole body preservation, is typically paid for using life insurance. I would be happy to answer any questions if you send them to me at &lt;max
You will find empirical evidence for the plausibility of cryopreservation in Alcor's library in the Science section. Unless you are utterly convinced that we will destroy our civilization soon, cryonics has a decent chance of working under reasonable conditions (i.e. if started fairly promptly after your body gives up).

No, your first impression was correct. But check a variety of sources (and their credentials). Many people posting here are clearly ignorant of the relevant facts and evidence. "fufm" for instance, doesn't consider that we have perfectly fine people walking around who were cryopreserved as embryos for years. Last year, a woman gave birth to a 24-year old embryos, returned from cryopreservation.

That is NOT the issue. Anything below about minus 130 C, using vitrification, stops ALL biological processes. How do you know when there is "irreparable" cell damage (no matter how advanced the technology)?

The evidence from electron microscope studies contradicts you.
