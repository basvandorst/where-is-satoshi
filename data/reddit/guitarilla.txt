You are forgetting that the “boom” just happened out of nowhere, and disappeared just as fast. In November bitcoin was 6.5k ish. Today its at 6.7k. 5 months total. That 20k was short lived, so you can’t base any assumptions on that. All that needs to happen is someone who whats to undermine crypto or just quickly make a killing to    dump a shit ton of money into it to create a lot of fuss, then wait for the idiots to start taking out mortgages out on their houses to invest into something they have no clue about, then cash out, causing the price to fall. And there you have it, they made a ton and hurt crypto’s reputation. Now you have a bunch of hurt people bashing and talking crap trying to cut their losses and get out with only bad things to say about crypto. 
What happens when you corner a beast? It starts to fight back furiously, even though it doesn’t stand a chance. At its peak, crypto was a 550B market. So if you had 100B at your disposal, you can easily pump and dump the entire industry, walk away with a good profit and leave it with a bad reputation. 
I wouldn’t be surprised if this was a doing of a large banker or even a government who understands what bitcoin means for them, and don’t want it happening. 
On the other hand, if bitcoin held at 20k for a year of two, then suddenly went to 6k, then it would mean that its in serious trouble. But that little spike, that came and went means nothing. It will continue falling for a bit before it goes up, but then it will continue to rise. Historically, its been averaging 100% increase every month. A nice steady climb until this pump happened. So it will continue to do so once it recovers and the miners keep mining. 
Nothing to fear!
