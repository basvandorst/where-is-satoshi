Even if he IS a snapcard PR dude.. I'm still interested in just about any service that allows me to spend bitcoin on everyday items. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 21:55:58
Try it. Post results. Each one takes a little cut on each transaction though...

Good man. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 19:21:11
Ah I see.

I never did figure out how to get coins OUT of a paper Wallet with coinbase though, even using the coinbase android app. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:18:22
Yep, got it.  I didn't know if you meant with a specific device order what, but I see what u mean. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:01:26
Mobile what?  I'm an IT consultant and I'm still confused.

I'm sort of "alpha testing"  a hexxit Minecraft server in where there are books worth a certain amount of bitcoin hidden throughout the world, I've made sure that the payouts are larger than the other minecraft servers as well.

Haha, yeah I looked at that pie chart and thought that as well. Color the unknown part blue. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:21:04
Haha, the items purchased seem to say "I only bought this item to support bitcoin" I'm not saying that's a bad thing, I thought about getting a phone case for just this reason.

I think that in the long run, mining technology will push Moore's law back into effect since it seems to have faltered lately, and bring in a new era of computing. bitcoin has always been about more than just the coins after all :)

Fontas?

Well, I don't actually tell them anything, they just message me and say that they are still waiting for the download to finish. At that point I know right where they went.. Which is understandably the default place anyone new would go, but now we have all these people assuming they need a 14gb download to get involved and that isn't really the case. The org needs a separate wallet section for new people maybe, I dunno. 
Just to clarify I realize how important being a node is to the network, I just feel that is something they can do after they feel more comfortable using bitcoin and everything else that comes with it.

83 emails for 2 tiny amounts??  What are the Emails saying? 
@_date: 2014-01-02 21:58:45
Sshhh, no post bad things. 
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:57:58
Fuck banks.

ICQ?  Isn't that the messenger from the late 90's with the flower? Lol

Min?  Max?  
@_date: 2014-01-09 21:19:25
I wasn't really complaining, more like an update.. Or perhaps a "hey where is it?"  I think the fact that the live chat guy told me to check back is what kept me from getting much further.  Now I know.

You could even just skip all the investing mumbo jumbo and buy in for $20, bitcoin is pretty flexible. You don't have to be an investor or a trader or anything like that, you could also be one of the little guys, keeping it liquid.

I ended up sweeping the coins using the Android blockchain. Info app, then sending them back to coinbase.. Cost me a little bit but worked. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:11:47
Wut?  Lol 
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:45:19
Bitcoin for bugs, man, good ideas is all you got. :) Excellent app concept as well , I'm gonna play around with this.

Keep honing this. Some of these concepts are pretty interesting.

Backdoors aside can we please kill apple already, I don't think I've ever brutally hated a company so much in my life. Just die already you beast!!
