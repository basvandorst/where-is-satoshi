Watch how fast another crypto can sneak up. I’m hodling and rooting for btc, but if shit doesn’t change the markets are just going to adjust like they always do... people want instant internet money, whichever crypto attains that is going to prosper no doubt. right now that’s not looking good for btc.
@_date: 2018-08-06 02:23:18
Where’s the link
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:33:29
If you believe in the technology why would you sell? If you're using it as a tool to get rich quick then yes go turn that btc to cash and buy your Lambo but there's so much potential to just fizzle out now
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:26:36

Yeah but can't you just dump both before that happens...?
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:49:13
No that point still holds, it was a time period where an economic bubble was a lot easier to be in effect, communication methods and technology were extremely underdeveloped compared to where we're at now, sellers of tulips were able to charge extreme prices because of this too. It didn't matter about the certain viruses in the bulbs, do you think all brokers of the tulips made sure they had the viruses? Things like that were a lot easier to falsify and persuade people to be legitimate 
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:21:18
Scared tbh I'm on margin so I can't afford it dipping anymore than like $500 in price until my position auto-closes.. that dip to $1800 that happened earlier last month is what makes me uneasy
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:32:28
Wait how? This would wipe my margin out if this was on Kraken can someone ELI5 
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:50:55
Shut up and hodl, pussy!
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:10:36
When would be like an estimate of when it's locked in? Or what determines when it's locked in?
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:27:30
Just a dip nothing to fear

Don't know why so many people thought it'd crash to zero 
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:45:05
I guess just wait it out, I forget what the exact time it is but if it's not confirmed in a certain amount of time it sends back to the wallet it was sent from

A week ago a user told me to hodl.
A week ago my life changed.
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:51:50
I guess people are always thinking about the drop in 2013.. literally over 70% loss in like a week. Then you have the 1800 drop that happened last month. It's good that it's steadily increasing right now but profit is better than no profit so I see why some people sell after jumps like this 
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:51:04
Need margin though and gdax and kraken are the only options for that
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:41:47
You pay a portion to hold a larger position. So if you want 1 Btc you only need like $700 and it allows to take the profit or loss from a 1 btc position. I currently do it 5:1 , so I physically pay for 1 btc but I hold 5 btc
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:41:49
Kraken! 
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:05:33
Lol...welcome to trading heaven , friend
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:43:05
Yeah downforeveryoneorjustme is saying the sites up as well
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:50:27
Yeah I was using leverage but I was closing the leverage position that I had long but it created another duplicate sell order that counted as a short sell
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:07:20
In my opinion, first red day means it's gonna hang around this area at least for a little while
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:33:23
I'm up $300 from my position an hour ago but can't connect ��
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:19:36
$3800����congrats to people who bought in low hahah 
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:18:24
No shot definitely gonna be a retracement from this insane increase, just gonna dip buy that once it happens
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:14:37
Random question but can you short sell bch on kraken?
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:20:40
Now it's like an unnecessary civil war
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:39:23
GDAX with a limit order 
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:54:40
Sold at 2860, had a solid $700 profit with margin thought I was happy with a single.. fuck man. Missed out on 2k profit ��
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:09:38
That's true. Yeah gonna play it a lot more conservatively from here on out 
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:16:27
I'm only referring to the alt as "bitcoin rotated 15 degrees to the right" from now on
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:50:43
I wasn't shorting I was holding long but to close a position you have to sell that same amount which I did but for some reason it sold twice so the second one constituted as a short sell
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:32:30
Buy on margin if you want it that bad lol 
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:22:04
Viabtc use their transaction accelerator, find your txid and paste it there, works every time for me
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:16:54
Looks like there's support at 3700 which is nice let's hope it holds 
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:57:41
You're right, hard to make long term money though. Just gonna hodl from now on, got in at 3200 with 4:1 margin, just gonna leave it not even gonna touch it from here on out 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:15:17
It happens lucky you didn't buy in at $4500 like a lot of people. It's going to be volatile, just don't panic sell... trust me you'll regret it
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:46:06
Yeah it's safe technical wise, but I'd wait to see this current price action, it just had a sharp increase so maybe wait for a correction
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:52:50
It's a loan but generally never take on bigger than a loan that you can afford to lose
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:51:22
News of miners switching over to btc again once bch mining profitability falls will start some bullish movement in my opinion. It's not priced in because the general public right now just assumes bch is more profitable to mine than btc. Segwit in my opinion is positive too because it means a scalability resolution but we'll see. I really have no idea as price isn't gonna react to one thing, I've just seen a lot of dips similar to this as most people here have. 
I never said I'm the only person who knows of the news though 
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:38:10
Just invest and hold, less stress and check it once a day don't obsess.
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:30:23
I was on it a little over an hour ago at the account page now nothing
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:19:00
Your entire post doesn't hold any value, you base it off the fact that 4 usd coffee would include 4 usd fee, no fees are taken from a percentage of the cost it's not a fixed price 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:19:28
I understand what you're saying but I started with a $600 account now it's at $3300 in a couple weeks, playing with margin is incredible but it makes me uneasy
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:43:58
It hit 2808 a couple hours ago, needs some major solidifying news for it to stay there though. Maybe some major BCash crash will help lol
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:41:05
Don't day trade, use coinbase or GDAX as a USA based exchange, dollar cost averaging is a smart move but try to increment more so your target amount is hit after around 4 weeks or so. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:48:38
Coinbase for instant debit, Gemini for wire 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:18:34
Ehh I feel like it's gonna fade away again when the difficulty adjusts unless they can find a way to make it more attractive again 
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:10:32
I'm on margin tho so if it goes below a certain amount I lose it all lol
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:15:08
How long ago did you start the transaction

@_date: 2017-08-01 21:50:05
Tbh I remember when Kim dotcom said btc would hit 2k within a year (this was when it was like 300) and people thought he was crazy and now it's nearing 3k still within the time frame he said it was.. ever since that I don't write anything off as not plausible with btc, because I literally watched that real time 
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:48:15
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:05:11
So since it's 4200 on there it more than likely has to hit 4200 on another exchange? I don't get it
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:05:24
 I honestly think bch might turn out to be another altcoin fad. Btc will reign at the head for at least a while 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:09:38
Pray to god it doesn't break to 2800 my margin is wiped at 2000 
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:08:20
It's 4388 on okcoin rn.... so it has to hit 4388 on Kraken..?
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:17:37
Holy shit that $3618 purchase might hold up to be straight money if this $3700 resistance holds 
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:31:42
Dude shut up 
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:12:19
trading or long term hold?
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:20:09
So the drop from 5k to 2700 was what? The free market acting up? Lol stop being ignorant. Crypto is here to stay, but it’s going to undergo corrections like it always does. Don’t listen to me though, just be sure to hodl when you see the sea of red.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:18:08
Lol... it’s not gonna stay here forever. It happens every single time, but don’t take my word for it. There’s bullish sentiments right now but it won’t be forever, that’s just the way markets work. Since it reached 7k it definitely shows moon is possible, but price always drops drastically at times 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:25:26
It's not guaranteed try to get in low though 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:24:08
Christ. How many times does history have to fucking repeat itself for people to learn ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:07:06
11k to 9.5 is heavy my friend
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:26:29
I mean some people here are going to say “oh use a hardware wallet where u control private keys because exchanges can exit scam” but honestly I’d go with a Coinbase vault, Kraken (Tier 5 verification account), or a Gemini verified wallet. They’re all secure, with the exception of Krakens support team being absolute shit. In each scenario though you’ll have to provide a lengthy amount of identification and this will probably take anywhere from a week to 2 weeks for the teams to verify your ID. Once that’s done, I’d call up a rep from the exchange and just make sure to follow what they say.
If I were you I’d use Gemini. I know people with $10k+ that use Gemini and are fine with it. I have $10k+ on Kraken only because it was my first option and I’ve just been way too lazy to switch and too paranoid i’ll send an insane amount to the wrong address lol 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:07:50
Exactly, i hate Kraken but i’m too scared to move it anywhere else lolol
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:13:49
Hmmm. But i️ thought Bitcoin was supposed to go up forever buddy?
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:23:09
No, the next correction is going to happen when everyone doesn’t feel this way, e.g. China ban. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:16:50
you’re right but market could’ve just as easily went against your favor.. profit is always still profit my friend
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:07:17
not exactly 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:59:50
Exactly, it’s just bad business what’s going on with Ver and BCH in general
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:36:37
So you honestly believe Bitcoin will go straight to $100,000 by the end of this year without dropping anything lower? Have you seen how volatile this market is? I love Bitcoin more than the average person but I know it’s not gonna be a straight green line to $10k and above 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:06:33
just trust me lol. i️ know it’s hard to accept, i️ love BTC too but this shit happens. it’s healthy for its overall market 
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:13:22
Set a reminder for this post then . history viciously repeats itself. welcome to bitcoin

@_date: 2017-11-29 23:55:42
this was actually funny 
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:24:01
Had huge FOMO and bought a huge position the last skyrocket to 5k right before it hit and bought huge at 4900... Had to wait a month and a half of anxiety to break even again through all the China news. Lesson w BTC is never feel rushed to buy lol 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:22:15
That’s way too low I think, if it crashed more than 60% i’d say it’s done for, but definitely 30-40% drop 
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:59:00
Created yea, replicated no 
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:36:59
I think this was the best answer so far 
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:17:13
I mean that’s not exactly what I meant lol
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:54:06
No it can’t ����
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:59:57
Should clarify too, replicated as it’s own like 1 bitcoin copy and pasting to 2 bitcoin, not including forks

There's gonna be a ton of confusion and just general mixed emotions involving this in the next couple days, best to just hodl. When the whole Segwit panic was happening people were thinking it'd dip even below 1k but it didn't, better to just hold and not look at the screen lol

@_date: 2017-09-15 23:57:56
It's a volatile new technology it's definitely bound to tank every now and then but it recovers.. there's too much momentum behind it for it to stay down, at least where it was yesterday. Also lines up with the Goldman prediction which is pretty awesome lol

Ya but Goldman says it's going $2200
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:45:16
Because if it's literally a straight up line it's artificial and is bound to crash as it resembles a pump and dump too much. Whereas with these corrections it's a stabilizing market at least in my opinion 
@_date: 2017-09-22 05:32:07
Dude..  that's a fucking speculation but I'll take it��
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:48:28

Not exactly it's just wsj is sponsored through universities such as the one I attend so I just thought it be odd they post an article "strictly" for FUD.  It's just generally a reputable news outlet for financial information I've generally only read articles from them that state facts but this one seems so one sided

@_date: 2017-07-28 06:18:43
So if I have 1btc and it forks I'll have 1 BTC and 1 BCC? 
Assuming the price is steady, wouldn't this be just like free crypto? Is there a value for BCC yet?
Shit I can't wait until all this is over
