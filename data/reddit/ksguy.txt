Here is a forum I started working on a few months ago and lost interest when I saw the traffic on bitcoin talk.
It's setup and could work, if people are interested in using it I could certainly open it up.
Now that bitcointalk is down, maybe it's a good time for me to work on this project again.
It's a free forum to join and IMO, running on a better script then bitcointalk.

oh man, sorry Theymos but this isn't true
I feel bad for the work you have to do, but this could have been prevented in my opinion.

Here is one I started working on months ago but stopped when I saw the activity on the smf forums.
Although I can't stand smf, it seemed (at the time) to be doing a good job.
Now it doesn't even have a splash screen or redirect.. just a blank "can not be found" screen.
