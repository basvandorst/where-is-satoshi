The website is not even secured. Should never trust a website without a verified certificate.

Better get data in that case, because it's definitely not worth the risk of meeting in a non-monitored place with active security. And waiting for confirmations could take time, during which there's a lot of scenarios that can occur with no one to have your back.

Your stupidity makes my head hurt. Have you ever used or transferred money in your life internationally? Because the statement above clearly suggests you haven't. 50k to send a million internationally? You high?  
Look at this quote to send 50K to India from US. There is $0 fee. 
[Also] let us not forget the conversion rates from BTC to any fiat currency has way too much margin compared to fiat to fiat. So even if you don't lose much in transfer, you sure as hell are gonna lose a ton in those transfer rates.

Wow, clearly no logic here. Wherever you're buying bitcoin from has fiat money and thus still government issued and will be in circulation from that vendor to somewhere else. This sentence alone says a lot about how misleading this sub has become from the early days.

I’ve had plenty conversations that are shorter than 2 mins, which would effectively mean that I’d earn from non-spam callers or lose money for calling people for less than 2 mins. Seems like a pretty big flaw.

From a technical perspective, the new chain seems much better and solves a lot of issues from the BTC chain. I don't entirely understand why people want to stay on the old chain when the new chain promises faster transactions?

Thank you, would that be 0.25% of my total BTC holding that I’m selling?

Can’t believe it’s not here yet, but...

I second that.

I would like to agree with you, but OP’s situation is basically demanding for a lawyer. Anyone who has that much money being bullied by some company should not take a chance just to say he didn’t need a lawyer.

If I move the bitcoin to Trezor now, how would it give me both coins when moving them back to Coinbase to sell for USD? Would it automatically happen?

If I move the bitcoin to Trezor now, how would it give me both coins when moving them back to Coinbase to sell for USD after the split sometime as an example? Would it automatically happen? Like if I initiated a transfer would it automatically give me both chains or just one?
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:06:32
I can only hope most people will move to the new chain

Let's assume I had x = 1 BTC in a website such as Coinbase. What would be the difference keeping it there or keeping it on my own hardware key? Would I get anything extra and how?

Thank you for clearing that up. I've been trying to understand the details behind the fork and this helped a lot.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:42:22
So I won't have to do anything to get access to my BTC on both blockchain coins?
