You took a huge risk - now you have egg on your face. 
I'm not gleefully rubbing it in, but you seem to be unable to "man-up", accept your losses, learn from them and move on...

I'd guess because google is an american company..

I agree,  just because r/bitcoin users are generally familiar with most metric sub divisions, doesn't mean 'Joe Bloggs' will be.

@_date: 2014-02-28 11:28:20
Makes sense, thanks heaps.

Or encourage large companies to actually pay the staff a decent wage?
If minimum wage was 0.25c would you still pay your staff minimum wage?
Just because minimum wage is so low is no excuse for greedy business owners to not pay a living wage IMO..

And to think I could be a whole $25 richer right now...
I actually think all your scaremongering is an attempt to drive prices down so you can get cheap coins...

If many people use this fork would it cause fragmentation of the userbase? Or is it used alongside regular fork?
So confused here. (I did have a quick scan through that thread)
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:52:03
hmm maybe because they are fraudsters?
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:38:54
Whole coins too!
None of this .00003 btc...
Love BTC though :)
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:11:49
Any publicity is good publicity:D
....to an extent.
@_date: 2014-05-19 22:46:21
Any chance you could link me to the info on how to do it? I see so many differing ways of doing it. I don't want to print it out however...
Would writing the private key/s down say 3 times, and tripple checking it is correct be ok? Then just use QT to transfer to the associated address?
Then laminate papers and hide really well?
Some reason I'm just as paranoid of not being able to retrieve paper wallet later on as I am having a keylogger pinch my encrypted coins...

Great summary, well put!
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:57:56
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:49:04
Yep, agreed bitcoin requires strong foundations to be built before moving the masses in!
@_date: 2014-05-07 02:42:31
Humans have a need to find a pattern in an everything.
@_date: 2014-02-28 02:59:10
So you were greedy, trading on a dodgy exchange?
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:46:40
To the moon!
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:28:19
Oh no you didn't! :D

Ignorance is no defence.
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:55:12
This I believe is a great point.
Bars rely on very quick turnover of customers to keep profitable (seems to be getting harder where I am).
Merchant app needs to be foolproof and drunken idiot-proof to be fast enough in peak bar times.
Perhaps even having the merchant-tablet hooked up to a red light or similar that flashes when a transaction is not processed correctly. Allowing the bar staff to quickly process the next patron without having to keep looking at a screen.
Also, perhaps having to swipe your Uni ID to purchase could help to track double spending/dodgy issues? (don't know if your uni bar is public or not)
I d'unno?

Why would anyone want to be on the Bitcoin Foundation if they didn't have something to gain from it?
@_date: 2014-05-22 14:07:23
I like your thinking.
Darren Brown had a good episode where he did this predicting horse racing results, was an eye opener for me.
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:44:55
Hi, I'm confused about your sites english?
"Learn all there is to know about Bitcoin, is how its changing economics."
Is it just me?
(cool site btw)

Great post I agree :)

@_date: 2014-02-24 06:59:32
Very good point!
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:00:11
Most definitely.
@_date: 2014-05-20 12:41:46
Thanks heaps for the detailed reply, going to give it a go this weekend.

Wow can't believe panglozz is spreading so much FUD!
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:07:42
Yeah kinda sad to see the sheer effort that people have gone through in the last week alone trying to trade on gox, when they aren't going to see any of it :(
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:34:49
Is there really any other way that this can possibly pan out?
Shit has hit the fan
@_date: 2014-05-24 23:05:24
Ahk, was wondering if it was part of a law that people must have a passport. 
I don't have one and many people I know don't have one so I think making people pay for a passport just to withdraw some cash is a bit extreme.
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:38:58
You mean 9k BTC?
C&amp;P from bitstamp:

@_date: 2014-05-06 11:46:27
Massive idea!
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:51:44
Yes, and that is the obvious conclusion...(not putting you down, its just the OP is deluded).
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:41:21
yep made $1m

I joined for bitcoin and doge, I stay for the drama :D
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:24:21
Ah, cheers for heads up.
That is disgusting (but I am not surprised in the least).

I actually looked at the link....you are correct.
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:43:09
Well I guess greed is blinding for some...
@_date: 2014-05-13 20:35:51
In New Zealand, where ATM's and EFTPOS (debit style cards) have been the norm since the 80's, I fear we are seeing an increase in high cost 3rd party ATM's in public places/stores. Yeah $2 to withdraw $20...urk.
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:29:03
So its "we" now eh?
@_date: 2014-05-04 22:24:50
Your hostility:

Begging isn't going to help I'm afraid.

Yay, great to see a kiwi store, (dunners here) will be keeping an eye out!
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:31:52
Err are you for reals?
That lisp was incredibly irritating and amateur..
@_date: 2014-05-23 23:50:50
I see bitstamp asking people for their passports often...
A lot of people don't own a passport?
@_date: 2017-04-07 18:14:20
If you pay a higher fee than before yet still don't get included in a recent block... bitcoin has indeed become BOTH slower AND more expensive.
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:58:50
Sorry bud, core right now: 1(MB) * 6 (blocks per hour) * 24 (hours) * 365 (days)= 52 GB per year 
wtf is with this propaganda
