The fact that the news article is from yesterday and within the article it says "UK cryptocurrency firm is expected to receive approval from the Financial Conduct Authority on Monday" *and also* that Googling for "Prime Factor Capital" returns only the news story above suggests that nothing came of this *or* that the whole article was just shilling

I like this answer. BTC always seems to have been this solid core that no other project has that is big and strong enough that nobody can attack it. It can't be everything so it shouldn't try to be. Build layers on top of it, that's great. But it annoys me to read that BTC should be altered in ways (increase block size etc) to enable instant P2P transactions. There are so many other projects trying that already, using better methods
Do you see the people wining the power of money or do you think that governments &amp; banks will suppress/restrict cryptocurrency enough that they either control it or have many fingers in the pie?
@_date: 2019-07-08 10:36:05

Doesn't look right to me
Iceland - Free electricity from thermal vents + free cooling from cold air. Mid scaled cost
UK - Expensive electricity and moderately warm summer. Certainly no free cooling from outside air for most of the year - Mid scaled cost
All the cheaper places seem to be on the equator, where air is the warmest all year around and would require heavy electric cooling

Not sure how much you visit but you will realise after browsing it for a while that it's mostly people who are paid to down vote anything BTC related. It seems that Roger runs a few alt accounts to stir the pot every now and again...
I tend to ignore these days. It's pointless trying to raise a debate there unless you're promoting BCH. If your information is true, which is seems to be, then let it circulate naturally. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 09:25:36
Exactly. People are willing to take small bets
"Why not risk this $10/$20/$30 etc to get $1000 free?"
The scammer pulls this off 10 times and it's at least $100 and from the country the scammer is based, $100 is a lot of money

I'm calling it *not* a bull market as i've decided to use a 2 minute timeframe and the price has barely moved in those 2 minutes
If you're choosing "this year" as a timescale to show a 45% increase then that's OK
Somebody else may choose to base their percentage rise over 4 years. They for sure will call it a bull market
That makes it subjective

If you look at the common OPs post history in you can see most of them follow a framework for:
 - What they post
 - How they post it
 - How often they post
 - How they reply
It's a classic case of people paid to post. I get a fair few self giggles by posting in and reading the replies
The majority of posts in are news articles. The rest is people shilling BCH (paid for) and people enjoying winding them up (people like me). It's a complete smoke and mirrors sub-reddit. It shows over 2,000+ users online at *all* times which suggests to me that Roger has paid somebody to write a script which connects multiple bots to the subreddit to make it appear an active sub-reddit.
Nobody praises BCH outside of Take Twitter for example. Any post by Roger or any mention of BCH gets roasted. It goes to show to me that everybody knows that BCH is a scam but Roger and co are paying for the illusion that BCH is doing well in Also take the 24h volume of BCH trades. It's very very low compared to other top 10 coins. You can assume that a lot of that is wash trading which leaves BCH hugely neglected by the crypto space. BCH blocks are being mined at sub 20% capacity....
It's fairly obvious that Roger and Bitmain made a gamble on BCH and as Bitmain have made *huge* losses, you can only assume that Roger Ver is massively "out of pocket" on the same gamble. You can bet your bottom dollar that Roger is eager to cash out as soon as possible but the time isn't right yet. He, and Bitmain, need the BCH to increase before they can place their huge sell orders to recoup as much of their loss as possible
People seem to assume that Roger is super rich and he probably still is but when you go in heavily on a failed project you aren't going to let that loss slip away easily. You're looking to get back as much as possible of your loss
It has all the signs of *stay away* from BCH to me
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:13:13
The moderation of confuses me
I don't understand why they don't remove posts that clearly point out BCH for what it is - a scam
Nor do they remove posts of people full out trolling for giggles
@_date: 2019-01-17 13:31:26
There's nothing that can be done. "Bitcoin" isn't a registered trademark or copyrighted.
