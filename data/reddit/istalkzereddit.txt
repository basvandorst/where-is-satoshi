Are you actually mentally retarded, payments using bitcoin and trading bitcoin back to fiat is all taxable under capital gains tax. Turning dirty money clean is no easier through bitcoin than it is through a dirty company as a front.

So you actually buy the bitcoin on coinbase, then move them over to gdax? If I’m gonna just incrementally buy and hodl is it worth moving them to gdax or keep them in coinbase?

Yeah I remember that happening, lots of people lost a lot of money as they wouldn’t let anyone close their positions either. Luckily I waiting for a good point to go in at that point so I didn’t lose anything. Apparently it was an issue with their stock feed but so they froze everything to do with bitcoin, so any open positions couldn’t be closed. Regarding the more recent issue, only my personal experience as information, they’ve changed it to a short only market so you can’t trade on the price increasing. 
I have been using them for a few months and have made a decent profit, I too was using the bitcoin mini market with 3-4 positions open mostly, they were charging a 0.90 pence interest swap on each position which was fine, but they’ve now hiked that up to £7.50 which is pretty ridiculous in my opinion. It’s also very convenient they decided bitcoin was too volatile just after they took the swap interest for my position.
Also, they increased the margin for bitcoin to 90%! Most markets are ~1-3% but bitcoins 90%? 
Mostly I just think it’s ridiculous that they’re are using the excuse of “preventing customers from eventual losses”, the whole point of trading is that it’s risky, if you lose all your money cause you’re riding a high and it crashes that’s 100% the customers fault why should the trading platform be able to dictate when I can or cannot trade certain items.

Dude I’ve been margin trading for the last month, through 2 ~2.5k crashes and I’m still like 280% in profit. Margin trading is fine but it’s just more time consuming and complex to hodling
