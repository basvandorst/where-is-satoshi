u/pineapplefund, just a recommendation: 
This is a great political activist service that operates free of charge. They get people in touch with their local representatives and helps users craft a message. 
Right now there is a big surge on the Net Neutrality debate and CHIP funding in the US and this little bot service is doing some awesome good.

He got better.

Bad bot! Bad! Those don't exist.

You are solo mining with only a BFL 5GH/s machine? That probably not a good idea. You might want to join a mining pool.

Here too.

How is this going guys? I'm trying to help too.

I can understand your confusion from a non-native speaker standpoint. "Complaining" has, in general, a negative connotation  when it is read or heard by others. While you do not intend it that way it is best to avoid its use if your desire is not to upset those you are talking about. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:17:54
You sir, with your logic and your thinking... STOP THAT.

Last I checked a computer running OSX is still a computer and usually it belongs to a person. Thus "Personal Computer" or PC. Hate to be the one to break it too you but just because you are running OSX does not stop your PC from being a PC.

If you use that PC for gaming be careful with your card. You could do some damage and make it not fully worthy of using for gaming any more.

I was number 32xxx at one point when I signed up on April 10th, I got verified on the 23rd. Hopefully that gives you an idea. It will definitely take a week. Maybe a little more.

Minepeon on R-Pi doesn't take anything at all. It's free to use and has no built in charges. You can use it with a pool or your own pool if you set it up.

[MinePeon Bitcointalk.org Thread](
Minepeon for the most part if fairly well automated. As soon as the OS boots it will start hashing. It comes with cgminer and bfgminer installed and you can select which one to use from the web page. I installed it on a Raspberry Pi for the first time today just to check it out. Being that I don't have a FPGA or ASIC miner yet I couldn't test it myself. Was just checking out the underlying OS and stuff. But I think it's a nice build and I plan on using it with both my 5GH/s from BFL and and the 9GH/s worth of ASIC chips I ordered.

That's gooeyist

You want some legit buys then go get an account on bitcointalk.org and get out of newbie jail. Once out head over to the Custom Hardware Section which is a subsection of the Hardware section which in turn is a subsection of the Mining section. Got that? Good.
Once on there look for people with established rep that are selling chips in group buys. Make sure they are offering escrow if possible. If a offer looks the least bit shady walk away.  But, if the seller has a good history, if this is his second or third round of group buys, or is otherwise endorsed buy well known members in good standing then you probably got a good one.
When in doubt of if something is legit, wait a while to see what others say. Watch what questions are asked and look for answers to those questions that are detailed and explained. Any good seller on there has a good conversation going on with the majority of posters with very few hostile exchanges.

Get yourself an account. Invest in one of the mining funds. There are a few trading sites around.
 
 is one
 is another

Seriously don't let me get to you. I'm inherently untrusting of anything I find on this subreddit and other places when it comes to bitcoin. There have been a lot of scams and a lot of malicious activity from people with unproven records (also on the part of those with proven records that took a wrong turn). You even acknowledge this danger in other responses in this thread. 
One way to become trusted with people is either posting the source code or by posting details of other things you've coded and are running on peoples systems. Show us something that attempts to prove you are trustworthy. You can't ask us to take it on faith. That's too unreasonable in this day and age. I'm not saying you are a bad person. I'm not saying you are untrustworthy. I hope you continue to develop your program and that you find it immensely useful as I'm sure others will should you repost it. 
Did I come across as an ass originally? Absolutely. I'll be the first to admit that it is my primary nature to be one. Doesn't mean you should take your stuff and bail. One opinion should not drive your actions, there are plenty of others who might use this and might be more trusting than me. 
I do apologize if I severely upset you, but lets all remember, this is the Internets. The minute anyone wants to be oversensitive for a moment is the minute they are going to get hurt. Specially when they are being oversensitive towards a stranger. I'm nobody to the vast majority of you and my opinion should carry the equivalent weight of that status when you read it.

Compiled app that not signed and you want us to run it on our PC without a release of the source as well? 
Get lost.

so how exactly are you doing a wire-transfer into campbx? My only options I see are Dwolla, money order and personal check.
