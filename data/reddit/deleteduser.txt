Eats to peat?
Peat moss is gross.

Unless you figured out all the electricity costs and whatnot.  If you did, that's remarkably close to market value.

Oh... I remember that show :(

Well, we don't *all* pay for it, just the people that maintain a balance and merchants, which is why merchants should provide more of an incentive to use bitcoins.  I'd much rather use bitcoins, but at this point it's not the best financial option for me on most sites.

Gyft is great, one of the only sites where paying in bitcoins is benifitical currently.  Hopefully more sites end up like this.

Maybe they will pull what China did and keep threatening to ban Bitcoin.  A never ending cycle of people smashing and buying phones.

Fair enough, lol

If you include a larger transaction fee, then you might get butled quicker.

Well, that certainly doesn't sound like free hd for life.

I get dressing up is his shtick, but it sure doesn't help the Bitcoin stereotype...

My credit card gives me 2% back and had protection against fraudulent charges.  If I receive one I just call them and they deal with the rest.

WOAH, THEY [DISTRIBU**I**TED MORE THAN $50 IN BITCOINS](

You got to teach them to use a search engine.  I'd be on board for a bot that directs them to 
Answer a question on twitter and a man learns for a day.  Teach a man to Google and he learns for a lifetime.

Maybe they really do mean BTC, and the glider power-up costs $12,000.

Well documented between April 2014 and April 2016.

Geez, what can't you do with a cockulator?

Gpushack itself?  They are the ones actually making the donation in the end.  Its a win/win for them.  No transaction fees, a tax write off, and free advertising on @_date: 2013-04-11 02:40:25
He put in 60k today?  I must have missed it.

You think NFC is bad?  The AFC only really has the Broncos and Chiefs.  I guess the Patriots too, but Gronowski is now out for the year.
@_date: 2013-12-25 15:43:13
Neither, it sounds like.  They gave him fiat.
