I just looked it up and most of the people hated on him for claiming all of this stuff that he invented, but he really didn't. I mean he does seem to get more credit than he deserves among the core people. So your theory is that he the reason is that he is really Satoshi and everyone is hush about it because they know the implications if he got out?
Can you atleast point us in the right direction? Me and i am sure others are intrigued.

SS: I was listening to Charlie Shrems, untold stories with Ben Mezerich.  Ben asked Charlie, do you have any idea who Satoshi Nakomoto is? Charlie replied, I used to think it was a group of people, but now i think it might be this guy who was a drug smuggler. Or something to that effect. So I immediately was like wtf, what is he talking about, so i dove into it. He gets arrested around the same time that Satoshi disappeared. He apparently created E4M (encryption for the masses) and gave it away to the world for free.
This all came to light here in the last few months during the Craig Wright case, where they redacted part of some evidence he was presenting but forgot to redact the footnote referring to Paul Salotshi Calder Le Reaux. Real interesting read and pretty convincing, if i am late on this please forgive me but i hadn't seen anything on it til now.

I am sure they dont actually use gold to trade right? Its would take so much to move and you cant just wire transfer gold. I knew they were stock piling it right now but i thought they were just prepping for the US economy to tank. I guess they might as well trade gold but it just seems like it would be such a pain in the ass to lug it around.
I feel like it wouldn't take that long to figure out how to transact in bitcoin, but i don't see those major powers really liking the idea of bitcoin in the first place. China obviously hates it. Of course the price would have to stabilize first, those sort of transactions alone would drive the price through the roof i would imagine.
@_date: 2019-06-25 01:50:28
I will second that, I have a pretty similar view point. The only thing that makes me trust it is other credible peoples enthusiasm. I have never tried to use it and don’t understand if it’s separate thing or embedded into bitcoin or what the hell. From what I understand you need to form a network with a select group and it is just faster if you are making recurring payments to one place.

I see what you are saying, but the main reason people don't spend it is because of the possibility of how much it could be worth in the future. You could be kicking yourself for buying something that would cost you 100 USD now that could be spending  2000 (or what have you) future USD.  
Once we begin to see the price stabilize or become the standard, then i see people using it as a from of currency. I dont understand why we would use multiple coins instead of just Bitcoin to transact, but that seems to be a mainstream opinion. I vaguely understand that transaction fees are cheaper on some and privacy is better on others, but its also my understanding that bitcoin is always adopting new things to make it more private, faster, and cheaper to transact.
@_date: 2019-06-25 01:44:04
I did the same, but much more recently. It’s actually easier to save because it’s a much more exciting way to put it into you savings. You are buying something and saving at the same time. I’m up about 30% right now and the amount I’m putting into it increased by like triple.

There is a stigma of it as a completely speculative asset that has no actual value. Plus people confuse it for all of the negative aspects of shitcoins. Most people dont realize that its limited (scarce), completely decentralized, and a fixed supply. In fact i feel that most people think its the opposite of this. They think that the "Owner" of bitcoin can just make more whenever he pleases. We still have alot of work to do to bring education to the masses. 
The main problem is people have no clue what is wrong with the Central Banking system and have no understanding of what money really is. It is taken for granted.
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:17:24
Yeah if you've ever seen Mr Robot, they rid the world of all debt, but then the people at the very top are basically unaffected. The people who suffer the most are the ones that they wanted to help. Money is a tool that the elite use to control the masses. 
It would be great for bitcoin but the tribulations everyone will have to go through before any kind of massive infrastructure is implemented would be pretty gruesome, most likely. In the show they just implement "E-coin" which is probably like Global Coin or whatever Facebook decides to call it. I almost want this all to happen though so i can tell every one "i told you so". Thats fucking petty if im honest with myself its true.

 *So maybe BTC might make millionaires out of 500,000 people, make good money for another 10,000,000 (and they might not be the same people that have $$ now, but probably most will be) and maybe we end up without federal reserve (if things really change), but your still going to end up with less than 100 people having more than 50% of all BTC. And if we are not lucky it could be 10 people.* 
Thats the thing that worries me also. How do we get all of the wealth distributed through the world so that we dont have the too much in the hands of too few? i mean i would love to be rich, but i worry about falling into the same problem we have now but just transferring it over to different people.

I very much hope the same. While i feel like most of the people in the space are pretty nice people, who want to change the world for the better. However i look at people like Craig Wright and Roger Ver (which i admittedly dont know that much about, just my perceptions) seem like the have been consumed by the wealth and the status that their early adoption has brought them. They seem like the greed has consumed them and dont give two shits about the common person. Shit I would love to say that i would never let that happen to me if i were in that position, but i honestly dont know how i would act. Power and greed are some of the strongest forces there are.

I agree, that big crash was a confirmation to most doubters that it is nothing more than a fad.  I don't know a single person other than myself that knows a damn thing about bitcoin, if they even have heard of it. 
In my opinion we need to get Andreas Antonopoulos to get to a main stream audience. He was what really led me to the light and helped me comprehend at least the basics and potentials of bitcoin.  Before i started looking at his videos i just thought it was a vehicle for buying drugs on the internet.
People dont know why the current monetary system is bad in the first place, they use it every day just fine, what could be wrong with it?  Once you begin to understand that and erode the trust people have in banks and the greed of the people in charge of monetary policy, can you even begin to present them with the solution. 
I know this is probably a "no shit Sherlock" comment but this is what I have noticed when I start to try and preach to friends and family while receiving almost complete automatic resistance(i'm sure fore multiple reasons). I am into bitcoin for the philosophy, while the idea of getting rich is not lost on me, but i was aware of how one sided central banking is long before i started getting into Bitcoin. It still took Andreas laying it out for me in simple terms for me to grasp how disruptive and incredibly innovative it is.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:57:15

My brother-in-law (mentioned above) uses the argument that the US dollar will never collapse because of our Military might. If anyone wants to stop using the dollar as the world reserve, we storm in and fuck them up. Which isn't a bad argument, but i think he over estimates that aspect. I think People still dont understand what a fucked up system Central banking is. I think that point has to be driven home before people can really understand what is wrong with fiat currency. I feel like it is grazed over in most explanations.

Thanks, I guess one other question I have is. What is the problem with the original mode of transactions? I have not noticed it taking more than a couple of minutes to transact. 
I am clearly missing something I am sure. Is it just about the fees? I guess the higher the price of bitcoin the more the fees matter?
@_date: 2019-06-11 20:01:54
i just went through this last night. My dipshit brother-in-law can not get the idea out of his head of it as  an investment and not a disruptive technology. He saw some John Oliver episode on crytocurrencies and how some of them are scams and just make more whenever and equates that to "the owner of bitcoin can just make more bitcoin whenever he wants"  I tried to explain and his mind was already made. I fucking hate him. lol. He makes a lot of money and I just make ok money. I really hope bitcoin shoots to the moon so I can spit Lambo rubber in his face. Yes I'm jealous of  him deep down inside, but I am glad I am not a tool.

@_date: 2019-05-21 16:02:36
I am kind of new but a little further down the road than you. The keys let you access the wallet where you keep the Bitcoin. So if you are using the Cash App (easiest way to buy in my opinion) once you are ready to take full custody of the Bitcoin you just scan QR code and it sends it to the wallet you scan. From my understanding the keys just allow you to access the wallet where you store your Bitcoin, not the actual bitcoin itself. 
I bought a Ledger Nano S on Ebay (make sure its sealed, tapmper proof) for like 35 bucks and its alot less complicated than i thought a hardware wallet would be. Instead of having to type in your 24 word key every time you just use a pin that you create and connect it to the computer. You can download the app and check your balance from your phone but you cant send anything without your actualy ledger. If you lose it than you can still recover it with the 24 word key phrase.
