Standard non sequitur humor? Ads being dumb is the common case.

A bit funny that they show the Telegram contacts for a split second before blurring them.

For the average citizen of planet earth at the moment? An online tokentrading game with high volatility. Might make you rich though.

"All BTC loans on Poloniex are lent in a common pool that is shared across all markets and borrowers."  
I assume that it's in the fineprint that the markets are not separated, and if that's the case u/BitcoinCitadel is correct.

But that is a difference in degree and not a difference in kind as you argue. How can you speak with such certainty of the complete uselessness of BTC if the only differentiating thing is the trial of time, when it's only existed for a decade?

Yeah. I have no experience with coinbase, but I sure don't want the security level of "You know, I think you look similar to some dude I heard had access to this account earlier, so go ahead!"

Looks cool, but I'm having trouble associating this with anything else than the brazen bull.

Hi! I would like to redeem my BTC in a finger. Preferably a pinky!
(I'm not weighing in on what's backed and what's not, I'm just saying that this 140character rebuttal seems to miss what's usually meant by 'backed', and isn't a strong one)

Gold being beautiful is an opinion about aesthetic appeal. What's the difference between that and thinking BTC has aesthetic appeal as the original implementation of an cryptographic blockchain? Math is beautiful too.
