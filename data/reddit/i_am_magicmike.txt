haha yeah except it was worse cos i hadn't slept yet, so being sleep deprived and watching the numbers (especially when they go up like this and create all the hype) is so difficult for my sleep schedule lol

Out of curiosity, when you are tipping all these people, how does it work? I've never been tipped (that I know of) nor have I tipped someone else myself. Do you have to use BTC and deposit it into the bot and then the bot sends the same BTC to me? Do you use regular Fiat to fund the bot? Sorry for all the questions but I see these tips all over the place and don't really know what to make of it.

So did you pay the bot in fiat or btc, im curious?
edit: and what does it get access to/how do you pay it? im assuming you dont link your bank up to it if its fiat, i guess its btc and it generates an address specifically for you that you put btc into?

Glad someone had a good laugh, hopefully it gets your pumped for the next bull run too!

Ok great! Next question - assuming I buy a hardware wallet like so many people have recommended, can whatever website he uses to buy and send the BTC, send it directly to the wallet, or should I first wait for him to send the funds to coinbase, then withdraw everything entirely off coinbase and deposit it into the wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:28:32
Use Delta, far superior + you can add your wallet portfolio + coinbase (exchange portfolios)

Shit, generous guy although I've never seen that bot before, is it legit?
@_date: 2019-05-10 21:19:04
How often do you check your btc/wallet/exchange?

Any thoughts on ledger vs ledger vs keepkey? Assuming I purchase one of these and have it delivered over the next few days and send him my receiving address, will I pay a fee to receive the funds? The wallet I assume has to be plugged in (I assume via USB?) to detect that funds have been sent, it's not an automatic thing that happens while the hardware is offline, correct? And if I do pay a fee, what's the best way to avoid it/make it as low as possible? Can you give feedback on the other part of my question (how does he buy funds/send funds in the best way that doesn't have high fees?)

*I didn't actually use any crypto cos I'm currently HODLing. But still, having the option is cool.
@_date: 2019-05-27 07:04:45
+1 to your posts questions and general sentiment (I'm in the same boat)
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:20:26
So is it purely an ownership thing that people use wallets? Or a combination of that and security/privacy?
@_date: 2019-05-23 21:26:21
Yikes, poor guy paid with both of his limbs to begin that hot air balloon flight, maybe it's a metaphor within a metaphor, maybe by buying btc and going to the moon you have to lose an arm and a leg in the process.

Considering moving from coinbase to gemini. What would you hard sell be if you had to argue a case? Super newbie here, totally new to crypto and enjoy the coinbase UI (+app)
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:40:16
Wait, is this true? Can you link to some literature on this? What if you hold for say , 3 years in the US, then relocate to Austria for a year, and eventually cash out (with subsequently no crypto gains)

So I've watched like three youtube videos on this from deep lizzard and the like, still very new but can someone explain the [depth chart]( to me as if was 5 years old. I understand that one side shows the demand for purchasing BTC, the other shows the demand to sell BTC at a certain price, but which is which? I assumed green=buy but how come when I hover over a point in the green it says "sell=149.21321312 cost=$1350000" for example. Am I stupid? Maybe this should go in bitcoin beginners but idk man
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:10:01
No but seriously I don't actually know what that does, I only just got into crypto this week so have no real idea how much that represents. Is that like, one cent equivalent?

Thanks for the lengthy reply! Much appreciated. The unique strong password is something I always do (I use my antivirus to random it then I usually save that in a different location. Already use 2FA for the login (although not per transaction, so that's useful info). I did read up about both trezor and subsequent fire proof cases, although like you mentioned, I don't know if I trust myself that well in terms of maintenance. I am not, and never will be, a day trader. I have stock and retirement investments/ETFs/mutual funds setup as my more "normal" investments. Crypto currency is kind of something I'm dabbling in with money I could lose and not be super upset about. I don't need quick access/liquidity, but I was curious about when the day comes that I choose to withdraw my money, how much coinbase will charge, how much my bank will charge, how it will affect my year end taxes (I do them myself personally but have never had crypto on them).
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:03:47
It does, although perhaps I'm not fully grasping the concept (like I've mentioned in multiple posts, still super newbie here).. 
So, are bitcoins really "stored" anywhere other than the blockchain? What I'm interpreting from your comment is that none of us really "owns" bitcoins and we merely have "access" to them via a "key/address". Is there a difference between a key and an address? Or is the address more like a safe, and the key is .. well a key to access that safe? Also, let's assume I change the receiving address every time I am sent coins, is there like an app that I could use to basically show me what my wallet's "portfolio" and/or total networth is? Can someone own multiple wallets? If so, what's stopping him from sending coins back and forth to him or herself, to influence the "balance" on a public address on a blockchain explorer.

ELI5: nodes + lightning nodes - do I need to know or care about them? As a regular DCAing individual that doesn't day trade, I own my own hardware wallet where I store the bulk of my btc. I know a little about btc, I know about the coming halving next year may, I know about private keys vs. public keys, but I don't know anything about what a "node" is and how it affects the average individual? Should I even bother researching it? I have a spare desktop work semi decent components that I don't use/is currently stored in a closet, and I've seen people mention using spare PC's as a node (even though once again I don't fully understand that point )
