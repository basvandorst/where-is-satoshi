@_date: 2018-08-08 14:59:16
How long was it that you were actually here?
@_date: 2018-08-21 13:09:08
I hope you understand that btc was supposed to disrupt financial institutions but in reality you folks seem to think that now it is a store of value and not meant to be commonly used as a p2p, feeless and instant transfer of not only what we call money but information as well without being able to be changed or altered for any selfish individual to capitalise.
I wish you all the best. 
I won't comment or trash you anymore cause I now feel like I'm getting into a pissing competition.

Sometimes I think that Bitcoin was positioned to be targeted at the less fortunate especially with alts and the gains. Once you have the lower and middle class sucked in then the high class will take over their invention, but hey, all conspiracy theories around here so who am I?

Quick to rip on him but you take the time out of your day to analyze and gather information on him.
What a true btc fanboy you are.... jelly much?

Good guy. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 14:47:22
Ok mate.
I concede, my pissing length is nowhere near yours.
We both have our opinions and they are not getting us anywhere.
I do have issues and I will put my hand up for that, but... they are mine, not yours.
For you to take insult to a criticism shows your character, instead of being so hurt emotionally maybe you could construct an argument, stating fact and truth and be open to being challenged and actually seeing the other side to the "bitcoin"
I love you xxx

You must be the pillar of society. 
Never have you done anything wrong or said anything that could be misconstrued in any way possible.
You seem very narrow minded but hey, I'm only going from your public actions 
@_date: 2018-08-21 14:55:06
Not bothered but you obviously are
I love you xx

What am I shilling exactly?
It's not even my post.
I was merely stating that, imo, a Bitcoin atm in a hostel is targeting the lowest class. If you think otherwise then please enlighten me and send me a pic of a Bitcoin atm in a 4 star or above hotel or even better at a highly reputable corporation building.
Would you like me to dm my bag holdings like a true shill or I could put it on this post, maybe I could sway you into buying one of my shitcoins so the price can pump and I can offload for a premium given the current market.
I look forward to your response troll
Farewell from down under and g'day mate!

I think the event will make all crypto rise in the price due to movement of coins if people get them off the exchanges and into their own wallets.
A lot can be learned from this especially taking ownership of your own wealth and taking responsibility for your own actions.
It will also test the network on its capabilities to handle transactions on speed once again like the last run when there was so much congestion.
But once again, hold your keys, hold your wealth and fuck the Intermediaries.

You wasted money on that. I'd rather shit in my hands and clap.
