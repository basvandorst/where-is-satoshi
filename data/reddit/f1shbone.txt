I don't think the argument is that bitcoin cannot go mainstream because of the wait time. The argument has been that this may represent a financial risk that vendors may not be willing to undertake, and therefore affect adoption. To what extent this may or may not be a "barrier of entry", nobody knows. So the argument has become that since we don't know, it's best that we work towards making it as easy as we can to be adopted, which logically follows to work on the confirmation times.

That would require the development and implementation of wallet functionality, and various cryptos have various needs. It's a major undertaking to say the least. Shapeshift is only meant to be the intermediary anyways, the means by which you sell X and get Y.

Good idea! The issue left on the table is traffic/volume generated, I would have to throttle and cap speed/connections between hours. Is that considered an OK thing to do? I don't feel that a hamstrung node would bring that much value to the network.

Point taken
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:28:40
This is amazing. Thank you Shapeshift team! You provide a service which I find invaluable. I'm not a crypto trader, so Shapeshift allows me to convert BTC into any other currency without having to sign up with exchanges. I just use Circle to get cash/BTC and then use Shapeshift for all my other needs.
@_date: 2015-06-17 20:50:55
Yes, it's also a bandwidth issue, I would have to throttle and cap speed/connections between hours. Is that considered an OK thing to do? I don't feel that a hamstrung node would bring that much value to the network.
@_date: 2015-06-17 19:43:46
I would definitely run a full node out of pure altruism here, but the problem is my ISP would very likely take notice of the traffic generated and enforce their TOS (disallowing running a server at home), which would put me in the awkward position of having to switch from fiber to crappy satellite, as they are the only ISP on my street. The US political climate surrounding ISP laws/environment needs to do a bit of catch up :(

That's a good question. I really don't have a lot of needs, I basically buy Peercoin every once in a while, and hoard it for the most part, and sometimes use it as tipping/bounty within the community. As far as altcoins are concerned, I think PPC is innovative and has a lot of merit and advantages and can exist right alongside BTC. It will be interesting to see what the future brings, I think the coin has value.

Your CC may show those funds as charged, or pending status, and the funds may still be pending behind the scenes between vendors. This might not be a Circle-caused issue.

I'd love to run a Bitcoin node if I could afford to take the hit on bandwidth. I am confident Verizon would have something to say about seeing that much of a steady traffic :( I feel that we've got the hardware part licked, but consumer-level internet access is still not up to par for the most part, and even given the right bandwidth, it's a concern of volume and you're at the mercy of your ISP. Running a server is against TOS under most, if not all, consumer-level connections.

It's really simple. Offering to give $25 in exchange of positive feedback on social media would be a bribe I guess? If you are cynical enough to view this great action on behalf of Circle to show that they care, as a bribe instead, suppose you'd be cynical enough to believe that is what happened behind the scenes.  
I have had the same positive experiences with Circle. They genuinely care, and have great staff on hand. They never gave me any money, all they did was give me a great app, make my experience awesome, and be there when I needed help.
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:36:40
Data volume is unlimited and my bandwidth can support running a node. However, knowing Verizon I have concerns that they may crack down and enforce their TOS (don't run a server) when they see the traffic generated by a BTC node.

I don't know that anyone has tested the upper limit on a Raspberry Pi, but the Pi 2 should have enough resources to stake several PoS coins. Just about the only way you will find out is if you get one and install the wallets on them. I can tell you that PPC PoS takes minimal system resources, and this should translate to other PoS coins.

I'm not sure what Verified by Visa means. I meant just the issuing entity, such as Capital One. They require their card to be activated. In order to do so, you have to install their App, log into your account, and link/confirm it that way. If not all issuing companies have this requirement in place, maybe that's something to be taken up with them. Either way, it's not an inherent issue with Apple Pay, but rather how CC companies choose to do business.

TL:DR version is people buy stolen credit card numbers online and load them up on Apple Pay. This was never meant to be solved by Apple Pay. It was supposed to defeat MITM type attacks, which it does. We need to get rid of the mag strip altogether from our credit cards. I question, however, how effective this really is, because my credit card company asked to activate my card via their own app, for which I was required to log in. So realistically even if my credit card # was stolen, you'd have to have my account credentials as well to activate it in Apple Pay.

So you sold Bitcoin and bought Peercoin, and now want to have a machine running 24/7 securely in order to get a return on your stake, correct? Your question was much better fit for but, as a PoS stakeholder myself, I can answer this for you. Set up a Raspberry Pi with Peerunity and just let it run 24/7. You can also set it up as a dedicated node but there's some risk with this since you will be opening up a port on the Pi to be internet facing.
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:07:30
It's actually two separate issues: bandwidth and volume. You may have a wide enough pipe to pump X gallons a second, but overall how many gallons are flowing over time and does your ISP care. Unfortunately I AM on Verizon and if they kick me off, I have no other ISP to go to. They're the only game on our street. I'm not into the game of throttling back, so I either let a full node run wild unrestrained, or I don't do it at all.

PoW is proof of work, the foundation upon which Bitcoin functions. PoS is Proof of Stake. Look at Peercoin, it's the coin that introduced this concept and has several advantages, the major one being an incredibly light blockchain. Peercoin currently functions as a hybrid PoW/PoS. PoW is still functioning as a way to generate and distribute coins, in other words good old mining.  At some point in the future this will be disabled.
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:34:53
In other words you understand and are a big fan of how cryptocurrency works in general. I share your sentiment.

A rooted phone doesn't necessarily mean less security, however it should be treated as compromised by default for all intents and purposes if the goal is maximum safety and security. The only way around this simple fact is if you can personally vouch for the code that it's running. There is an incredible incentive for wallet theft.
@_date: 2015-08-20 14:20:22
Pretty sure the iPhone 6 isn't the attack vector here. The problem rests elsewhere. If it were me, I would follow what Bitfinex suggested, as it is sound advice. Treat the computer as compromised, and wipe it and start from scratch. Also treat the google account as compromised, and either burn it or do a security audit on it and completely change the password. In this scenario I would recommend that OP just not use that gmail account, and start a fresh one with 2FA enabled from the very start.
@_date: 2015-08-24 18:21:29
I'm gonna say no. A Raspberry Pi 2 model B can load up the blockchain just fine without being a hardware bottleneck at the CPU level. I'll leave it as an exercise for you to look at the specs. There's other aspects at play here, such as OP's network speed and the speed of the peers he is connected to. As long as he is not running a super slow system, chances are it's not the issue.

It's not specific to the app. As long as the wallet app you are using supports "brain wallets", you can restore your wallet. Read an article on the topic sometime to get some insight, but essentially your master key is generated based on the hash of those 12 words. Works kind of like a domain name server, rather than trying to remember the IP address, you just have to remember google.com, and you get to where you need to be.

This is the right mindset. Don't rely on iCloud or other back-up features in general. If they fail, you lose your money. The recovery phrase exists for a reason. You need to take ownership of protecting your coin. Don't lose your recovery phrase and you won't lose your coins.

Just remember, don't necessarily buy into everything you hear. I'm multilingual, so I suppose for lulz I could also inject foreign words into my seed phrase. Then the brute force attacker will have to deal with that much more variation in having to cross-reference multiple dictionaries. Now, the issue becomes whether or not you can truly remember your recovery phrase and if you don't, how do you manage storing it somewhere securely. I would treat any phrase stored somewhere online as compromised by default, unless maybe secured within an encrypted database? Myself, I'm thinking why not engrave it on one of those dog-tag machines and keep it home safe with important paperwork.
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:23:55
I'm probably going to get downvoted for this, but ... to me this seems like a dick move. I am a big proponent and adopter of new tech and initiatives, but I side with what SF said, it ain't right to leverage a public asset and monetize it like that. At some point, we have to draw the line when it comes to capitalizing every single thing. Some people see $$$$$ opportunity everywhere they look. This to me doesn't feel like "the government stepping on the people". *We* are those people, does anyone here really look forward to a future where parking prices are all sorts of jacked up? Don't look at it from the opportunist perspective alone, look at it from the "I am trying to find parking and all of them are taken and people are auctioning them off at ridiculous prices" angle. This story has all the right triggers for people to support: government crackdown, bitcoin users. But don't lose sight of the fact that MonkeyParking is looking to make a buck by essentially just creating a bogus piggy-back market. To me this doesn't make sense. This gives people that have time an incentive to just take up parking, and the folks that can't afford whatever pricing is requested will forever and ever be screwed.
@_date: 2015-07-29 13:38:01
I didn't suggest they did. The parents' stated goal is safety, not the avoidance of buying Bitcoin altogether. And the advice given was to ignore that stated goal altogether by leveraging an avenue of obtaining bitcoin which has that much more of a potential to be more dangerous (meeting strangers in person).
@_date: 2015-07-02 21:39:12
This makes sense since the financial institutions are essentially/potentially insolvent. What a mess.
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:08:48
The issue here was the approach to tackling this problem. Suggesting to a minor that they ignore their parents and turning to a potentially that much more dangerous approach is just bad advice all around. Yes, there are those that suggested he doesn't go alone. I'm not talking about those people. It also serves to further cement this kids idea that his parents are unreasonable. Talking to them about it is a much better approach.
@_date: 2015-07-06 21:31:25
This. And let me add the why. It's built with security in mind. It's a brain wallet that doesn't allow your coins to go to a 3rd party for hosting: your coins rest on your recovery phrase. The app is fully open source and trustworthy.
@_date: 2015-07-28 20:22:50
Are those of you suggesting op use localbitcoins really THAT disconnected with reality? So the lesson you have for a 14 year old is rather than try to help his parents understand the situation better, and discuss trustworthy companies (Coinbase, Circle, etc etc), you would have him undermine their authority, go behind their back, and to top this all of, you would trust the judgment of a 14 year old implicitly to know how to safely handle meeting perfect strangers via localbitcoins, and therefore suggesting he use localbitcoins?
@_date: 2015-07-28 22:51:23

Somebody doesn't understand the design principles behind BTC and the 21 million limit.
@_date: 2015-07-28 22:37:00
Remember that a 14 year old can't reasonably expect to have the same level of autonomy allowed as an adult. So right off the bat that's not a good bargaining chip. I'm all for rational dialogue. My response was to something that didn't come across that way at all. At 14, you're hardly in a position to say "gonna do this regardless". That's an ultimatum.: "Also explain that if they don't help, your only options are to meet some stranger in person and do they really want you doing that?"
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:51:31
That amount was low, granted, but Breadwallet is designed with security in mind, regardless of how much value it holds. If somebody hacked your iCloud account, the thought process is that they would not be able to steal the contents of your wallet. The design decision of a solid "brain wallet" implementation rests on no back-up of any file. You just need to remember the randomly chosen 12 words.
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:39:13
This is a design feature of Breadwallet to ensure security.
@_date: 2015-07-28 20:57:58
You forgot the obvious option: do as they say. Your suggestion is a blackmail: help me get bitcoins, or else I'm going to meet strangers. As a parent, I can tell you that conversation would go very well.
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:01:58
This is correct! Op, get in touch with your credit card company and find out how much they charge on cash advances. That is how the transaction will occur with Circle. Put this in balance with the markup on localbitcoins and decide for yourself which is more cost effective. Most credit cards charge a bunch for cash advances.
@_date: 2015-07-28 20:08:58
Well, now I just feel like a total idiot. Having used Shapeshift several times, here I was thinking it's a service which allows somebody to exchange a currency of their choosing into another currency of their choosing. I guess I must have been using it wrong the entire time.  
I love Shapeshift. Worked every time, completely painless and super fast. Fantastic service. Thank you!
@_date: 2015-07-29 14:07:53
Okay. A couple of questions. Is the process simple enough for a 14 year old to follow? Do BTC sellers not set minimum limits on buy requests? How is the cash exchange facilitated in such a way that a 14yo can do it, without running into age restrictions and in person meetups?
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:54:23
There is a distinction you need to understand here, and that distinction rests in the difference between generating a brainwallet from a RANDOM string of words vs one chosen by a user. Here is the problem. People sometimes choose obscure sentences from obscure books because they think nobody knows them and that they are easy to remember. The way those are brute-forced is that applications use dictionaries based on known books to guess these sentences, or sentences that are commonly used, such as "Sally really truly superly loves Jack". The article isn't about brainwallets, it is about INSECURE brainwallets. A quote: "The problem, says Castellucci, is that humans don’t choose strong, random passphrases as well as they think they do. And any hacker can patiently guess millions upon millions of passphrases, converting them into private keys and trying them on every bitcoin address on the blockchain, the public ledger of all bitcoin locations."  
So, a randomly generated string of words that have no rhyme or reason, is a sufficiently safe wallet to be used. Op used 24 random words and a 24-character random password. Good luck cracking that in a realistic timeframe.
@_date: 2015-07-06 17:37:33
Yep! Read up what a brain wallet is, and how the concept works. It's pretty neat. Basically those randomly chosen words hash out to your master key, and that's how you gain ownership of the funds you have.

These design decisions to me made perfect sense. It was a bit odd at first because every app that makes use of Touch ID does so to give you access to the app. With Breadwallet this isn't an issue. The wallet can still perform many functions without needing to be unlocked, such as receiving funds and scanning the block chain. Reducing the use of pin and Touch ID to the actions that really need it is a good idea.

The video is a disservice to the goal of sharing objective information because it has a negative spin on it. To only speak about Silk Road and Mt Gox is to say all forms of currency should be regarded from the same angle, that they are used for illicit reasons.  
Edit: yep, comment removed. I find it fascinating when people encapsulate themselves in this way in their own reality.

In this context, it's a distinction without a difference. What's happening here is people's credit card data is stolen and entered into Apple Pay. So you introduce Bitcoin into the system. But that overlooks the fact that BTC is stolen out of accounts as well and there is no way to validate or confirm someone using a wallet where those funds came from just like with Apple Pay. Again, the root cause in both instances is security. The author is taking a philosophical stance, not a technical one: let's abandon credit card transactions because we've had to patch the system too many times. My point stands: the problem is not completely eliminated with Bitcoin. The goal here is better security.

Kind of a noob here with a fundamental question regarding how the blockchain syncs. Does the volume mean that the network could use more nodes? In other words, if more nodes come online, will this mean that overall traffic will decrease? If I understand things correctly, the number of nodes won't have an effect on traffic because all nodes must be in sync.

There's no pay coin exchanging hands, so I don't see the point being made that this actually supports the coin. It's like saying a poster of Enron somehow supports Enron.

It doesn't matter what he is or isn't, what matters is the content of his posts. A portion of people are going to find the process too involved for a simple cup of coffee. I go to Starbucks once in a blue moon, so for me it's easier to load up my Starbucks app. But for someone hitting it daily, 20% is a sizeable saving that may be worth the extra steps.

Good question. Probably to satisfy a customer demand. If people want it, sell it!

So I have to fire up my computer or phone, fire up the browser, fire up the website, log in, hit the refund button after I plug in my payment address. And then essentially sort of use these steps in reverse when I want to put the money back. I also introduce volatility due to the usd/btc exchange. Do I use dollars or Bitcoin to load up my Fold card? Because if it's Bitcoin and I have none or no wallet, that's so much more work to get started just for that 20%.  
OR, I can do none of the above and just waive the credit card at the barista. People decide for themselves what they wanna do and I don't deny 20% is a nice discount, but to say there aren't extra steps (assuming it all works as intended), is to have a blind spot as to why more people aren't adopting it.

The only reason I even said anything to anybody is to keep them from making the same mistake. Here's the thing. I DID run a Whois on the domain as I was a bit skeptical, but it just looked like a brand new launched business to me. The behavior of the guy put me off a bit as to how pushy he was to send free coins for the cost of shipping but I figured he was looking for reviews to help launch his site. Oh well! It was only 7 buck.

Just that. Funds stolen out of wallets through various means.

Right, but the odds aren't the same.

It's not a lottery because it doesn't cost anything to enter, and contributions are voluntary. A lottery is one where you are required to purchase a ticket for money.
@_date: 2015-10-07 16:36:37
Not go once, but infrequently. Between the trips, the money is tied up into the card, unless you want to take the extra steps to get it back, only to end up loading it back up. Question. How can the company afford to shave off 20%?

This is a PSA. Bastard only scammed me for 7 bucks. I hope nobody else goes for it. Bitchips.net is passing off as cryptochips.net, charging money and never sending the product. As evidence, run a Whois on each domain and see the registration date. cryptochips.net is the real deal.  Do NOT send money to anyone else for these chips.

For those that are frustrated about the verification process, I was too. Then I realized that Circle has to follow KYC laws (know your customer).

This is awesome. It doesn't matter that other similar products exist or will exist, the point here is that this is something anyone can build, keeping with the theme of BTC of "be your own bank".

Exactly. It's an issue of trust. So like I said, you could make your own by going to a name tag engraving machine, or you could break your private key into pieces and source the job to different companies, although I don't see the benefit in doing so over having an engraving machine do it at any store that has them. This is how secret projects are handled. You break them down in small pieces and source them to different vendors, and the only chance to figure out the big picture is for all of them to find out who they are and come together.  
Alternatively, you could generate a wallet from a specific alphanumeric phrase, and back up the phrase rather than the key. This, however, assumes that the inheritor is tech savvy enough to figure out what to do with that phrase. You could leave instructions, but they may not understand them and recruit help, and in doing so compromise security.

That's what my understanding was, but I wanted to double-check. Thanks! The large traffic volume unfortunately makes it prohibitive for me to run the node and I'd rather not run one if I have to cap traffic.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:39:31
I pretty much had the same reaction. I would have asked "please define limit, as in, how much can I buy/sell before I get in trouble, and what set that standard"

I love Bitcoin, I do, but the answer to the issue in the op is better credit card security. This is not an issue that absolutely cannot be fixed. Title is also misleading. The problem isn't with Apple Pay. The problem is with the way credit cards themselves are secured. Article also ignores that fraud happens within BTC wallets as well, which is the direct analogy to the credit card accounts themselves.

It was all caused by bitWallet, an iOS app. It usually allows you to add Bitcoin addresses on a watch list so you track funds going in and out. For some reason it would not allow me to add the BTC address but allowed me to add the hash. And I ended up paying it that way 
@_date: 2015-02-19 20:51:04
bitWallet also works. Nevermind you said desktop app. Sorry. bitWallet is an iOS app

Well, you know, bitcoin has died many times already, and it's also a longcon ponzi scheme, etc etc. Apparently it's the zombie of a zombie zombie's zombie zombiecoin that's so effective at ponzi that there's absolutely no evidence of it.

There's an easy way to test this. When registering the email, insert a +keyword in your email address. As an example, email becomes email+coinbase and will still route to email By employing this trick, you can track which site is leaking your email. This doesn't work with all services. I tried it with Yahoo and it didn't work. It works with Gmail for sure, been using this for years. My guess is that there's probably a disgruntled/dishonest employee that is doing this.
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:07:02
Somehow I ended up paying the HASH 160 address instead, I assume that's still OK.

Legit question for the community, because OP question got me thinking as well. Wouldn't it be safe and effective to use one of those name tag engraving machines found in stores to engrave your key? I am thinking it would be safer than sourcing out a company to do it because those machines don't store the data. Something along the lines of this  
  
You could also have some fun with it and break up your key into multiple tags, numbering them for sequence OR putting them on a keychain in the correct sequence.

I think that's because lots of people have been jaded by rampant scams, and are maybe too vigilant as a response. I don't know whether or not this is being caused by Coinbase, but I would say it is more likely the cause is one employee rather than a company policy or practice, IF this is coming from them to begin with.
