Yeah, bitcoin is great and all, but sorry, my upvote in this one is for Jürgen!

If there's a security flaw or a bug in the firmware of one brand, for example Bitmain that some people estimate is up to 80% of the hash rate in all coins (BTC/BCH/LTC/etc), and a malicious party is able to exploit and gain control of a large number of antminers, there is nothing to worry about?

As safe as all the closed sourced ASICS that calculate how much you can access with that ledger nano s.

What is the exact figure of exahashes per second produced by Bitmain products, whether owned/operated by the company or individual miners, daily in all the chains/coins (thus in the above scenario, they could be switched to the one under attack)?

With much lower fees than what the OP paid too.

Inb4 CSW/nChain claim they have a patent for that as well (while they read it).

This is the correct answer.

We are doing business with one that just credit us the amount instead, to be used for future purchases.
We are doing a lot of business, frequently and for a long time now, and are generally in very good terms, so it is more of an exception to a loyal customer, than their rule.

Vultr, one of the top 5 vps providers globally imho, accepts Bitcoin.
BitVPS is another good option if you want privacy/anonymity.

With UEFA's FFP regulations getting stricter and stricter every year, I won't be surprised if crypto is used for some sort of under the table payments, like those astronomical fees agents ask for example, in the future.

While ₿ is not the original logo, I believe this final iteration was partly inspired by the Thai Baht.
Afaik, so correct me if I'm wrong, Satoshi didn't had a name for the subunit and it was later named like that from the community as a homage.

Greenland is not a country, but an autonomous territory, under Denmark. Since crypto is allowed in Denmark, so is in Greenland.

I very much doubt BTC will ever switch to PoS.
Will some team make a fork (new coin) of it with PoS instead? Yeah, I think it is bound to happen one day.
Will it be successful? Maybe. Maybe not. Probably not, but who knows. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Kurwa! Instead of fucking a lovely country of about 40,000,000 people why don't you fill a [European Small Claims]( procedure? The company's name, address, phone and Polish trade number are public on the site.
