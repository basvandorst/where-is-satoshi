If you have chain anchor, why not just put the whole system in a centralized database and call it PayPal?   Everyone gets really excited about "blockchain" technology but that's missing the whole point. You might as well collapse the system down to a website with a database backend if you are going to have a requirement that a single individual in a position of authority can prevent transactions.  That's the purpose after all of AML/KYC, to be able for a regulator to prevent prohibited transactions that are in violation of U.S law.  
That's why I never bought any Bitcoin. It's all fun and games with distributed computing and crypto, but I was absolutely certain that it will eventually be considered in violation of the law and the U.S government will put something in to centralize it to make it comply with the law or else they'll get the SWAT team out and bust down the door and arrest everyone with a full node just like they did with every other alternative currency experiment that's been tried in the last 100 years.  Money is serious business and you don't just go around making your own.

I read the explanation of the Lighting Network.  I now have a question: What's to keep me from using the old balance sheet transaction and then executing the anti-cheat transaction I gave the other party thus putting the older transaction into another anti-cheat proof address before the other party can cancel my mischief with the anti-cheat transaction I gave them?

Problem is that you have to watch the mempool for any sneakiness and react quickly.  If someone can DOS your watcher nodes for 10 minutes they could potentially roll back the last transaction.  In bitcoin, the worst thing that can happen is transactions are delayed, but transactions can never be reversed without breaking crypto.

To be generous, this author doesn't understand that the federal reserve, when it engages in quantitative easing, creates money by making electronic book entries.  The author thinks that money is something real and thus creating it is fraud, but it's just an idea and it's the system we live in and that's how it's been setup for the last 100 or so years.  Whether this is a good thing or not is a matter of controversy.
The real trouble arrises when economic "experts" present the central bank system we have set up in the west as a fact of nature that is as natural as gravity or the second law of thermodynamics.  This causes all the confusion that our poor article author experiences, as well as many pundits, when they regularly predict a Japan style credit crash in China that never seems to happen.The reason our author is so confused and western "experts" are so confused about China is that they don't see money and banking as a social institution, but as this quasi-physical phenomenon.
I have commented about Chinese banking before and how it is different from western central banking, so I'll just link to previous comment threads linked to from [one of the many China is going to crash any day now threads]( that seem to have come up on a regular basis over the last 10 years.

So you think it's great if you have hundreds of gigabytes of shuffling coins around that has to live on every full node just so someone likely doing something devious thinks they got away with it?

How they will shutdown bitcoin in the U.S is simple.  They will demand people charge sales tax and capital gains tax on the dollar equivalent of every bitcoin transaction.  Just like they used the IRS to shut down the guy who was paying employees in US goverment issued legal tender 1850s gold coins by demanding he use the gold value of the coins and not the value stamped on them by the U.S mint, they will do the same thing to bitcoin.

Eventually, you'll have a coin shortage on the blacklist chain.  Uncertainty around fungibility and arbitrary blacklisting will drive the volume toward the free chain.

Really depends on what the miners do.  If miners decide to exclude transactions from blocks because men from the government tell them to, then that's a problem.

The chain will eventually split when an
 "illegal" transaction gets included in a block and nodes incorporating the blacklist refuse to accept it on threat of confiscation of assets and imprisonment by government authorities.
  This will nuke bitcoin, temporarily. The price will crash and the blacklisting miners will probably drop out eventually because they have higher mining costs and their blocks are not being accepted by nodes in China because they are building on the shorter block chain.  Most of the clients will point their spv wallets at china or whatever so they can get transactions through to other countries and receive transactions from them.
Largely depends on what the Chinese government decides to do.

I don't think the regression theory is in Human Action.  Maybe he revised it later.  Mises' main theory in Human Action about money is that it is "The most marketable commodity".  Whatever becomes the most easily marketable commodity becomes the currency, absent legal tender laws.  By most marketable, I think he means: what commodity is acceptable to the most buyers, is easiest to buy and sell, is the most common and well known valuable item.  In WWII prison camps this was cigarettes, etc.
The most important aspect of money-- real money-- is that when you spend it, you can't spend it later, thus forcing people to choose within well defined limits among uses of other people's time and capital.  Fiat money and fractional reserve banking makes it appear that this is true but cleverly conceals the truth that it is not and enforces that lie with legal tender laws and the tax code.
@_date: 2015-11-15 20:31:35
Money is nothing more than an effective means of mass persuasion.  You give people money to persuade them to give you things and do things.  You pay taxes to the government to persuade them not to confiscate your assets and send you to prison. Controlling what large numbers of people are persuaded to do is the foundation of the whole global power structure.  
When bitcoin was getting going I was having a good chuckle at the naivety surrounding the project.  You guys think you are just sending little encrypted messages around?  Nope.  You're trying to subvert the global system of mass persuasion that runs the world.  The government isn't going to like that.

Central bank bitcoin could work if there are unlimited coins available to mine and only private banks authorized by the central bank are allowed to mine and the blockchain is only writable by money center banks and the treasury and all the citizens have transactions that take place on side chains that have to be signed by a kyc compliant bank to be transferred to other financial institutions and then to their side chains.  This would prevent direct person to person exchanges of value which is very important for preventing crime.  It would also ensure the central bank and private banks monopoly on money creation, which is a pre-requisite for any new money system.

They've been saying that for the past 20 years.   Why does it just keep working?  
The lie in Keynesian economics is that it is unimportant how money gets spent in the economy.  Keynesians will even propose digging holes and filling them back up to stimulate the economy.
The truth is is that money that is printed to build capital that lowers the cost of production is less inflationary.  That's because if you hand out $100 in freshly printed bills to people on an island to buy coconuts, the price will just go up.  If you print money to give them $100 to build tools to harvest coconuts and to plant more trees, the number of coconuts produced will increase and thus the price will not go up and everyone will have twice as many coconuts.
That's the thing about the Chinese.  Their government does a halfway decent job of investing and directing all that money that they print in infrastructure because they fear inflation and the resultant instability.
@_date: 2016-07-28 15:05:32
In China the government prints its own money, debt free, and gives it to the banks which they micromanage.  Banks are essentially partially privatized central planning in China.  This is a completely different system from what we have in the west.  It does seem to work pretty well though.  Banks in China have bad loans all the time, the government buys their bad loans with electronically printed money and then they lend some more and the cycle repeats.  The party is able to direct banking policy enough that the economy keeps moving along and doesn't become hopelessly inflationary and/or corrupt.

It backed by the fact that if one decides to start a little 100% self sufficient village somewhere in the United States and trade among community members the IRS will insist that the community pay taxes on barter income and the state gov will insist you pay property tax.  These are all payable in U.S Dollars Only.  No bitcoin, no euros, no gold and silver.  If one doesn't pay, government officials will use force to confine community members and take all their stuff and that's why you need to have these little green pieces of paper, or their electronic equivalent that the federal reserve gives out in exchange for the government going into debt.

Unless you haven't been following the blocksize debate, you'll know that one of the main problems with bigger blocks is that fewer people will have the bandwidth and storage capacity to run full nodes, thus it will be harder for individuals to verify blocks without trusting people running full nodes.  Trust is the problem with our current system and the unique feature of gold that makes it so durable of a medium of exchange.  One can verify the physical properties by oneself without having to trust a third party.

One thing to keep in mind is that consumers not spending money means that the cost of capital equipment and improvements that take the same inputs as consumer goods will fall, thus increasing the yield on investment in plant, equipment and infrastructure.  
The point of building a factory or railroad is not it the "spending" it takes to build it but that building it makes the creation and transport of goods more efficient and thus lowers the human effort needed to create. And deliver them.  Hoarding of money by consumers facilitates this by lowering the costs of inputs for the construction and operation of the factory.  The steel makes the railway instead of making a swingset for the consumer's backyard.  This was the trend in the 19th century where new factories and technologies steadily lowered the cost of living.

Rich chinese can't find anything to do with their savings.  Lots and lots of bernakecoin flooding into the country and all they can do is put it in real estate.  The stock market is flat, currency controls, etc.  Gov really resents the petrodollar and likes bitcoin and gold because they are two things the western powers don't control and can't do the whole credit cycle trick on because there's no way you can fractionally reserve bitcoin, though "paper" gold is still an issue.  
There is no bitcoin credit money.  It's 100% reserve banking.  Sure, corrupt officials can launder money out of China via bitcoin but it would not have any effect on china's dollar reserves.  In fact if people started using the rmb in china to pay for exports that would massively undermine dollar printers (Fed, Big U.S banks) ability to control production in China and hand it to the bitcoin network.
