They just finished shipping all the pre-orders. Now they can turn to selling online directly.

When searching, be sure to check "Newegg" as the seller rather than "All Sellers", to filter the results to products that they will let you pay for using bitcoin.

Thanks for the portability tip. Indeed strtonum isn't necessary here. Simply using the positional variables works too:
    $8 ~ currency {
        volume = $2
        price = $6
        time_current = $4

Is there a restriction on running DNS-related services? The VPS page says something unclear about that, but the TOS doesn't mention it.

Bought shares of a mining stock on BTC-TC. Dividends were paid and everything was fine, until the exchange closed, and then the fund manager disappeared and kept everything.
Sold BTC online to a guy who was using stolen credit cards and fake phone numbers.
Left a small amount of BTC on bittrivia.com and then the site closed.
Had BTC in accounts on Inputs.io and CoinLenders which got hacked.
Had BTC and USD in MtGox at time of closure.
Overwrote a Namecoin wallet that had a few NMC, using the `mv` command and an unescaped `?`. (Not actually stolen)
In summary, I mostly lost coin by entrusting others with holding it or a derivative of it.

Well, I thought it was a cool project.

Thank you for sharing your ticker API. The stability in `btc-ticker-reduce` is controlled by the `halflife` variable which determines the amount of smoothing. I'm curious, how do you obtain much more accurate prices? Do you have any suggestions on how to achieve better accuracy using the input of raw trades?
A goal of the exploration of `btc-ticker-reduce` was to make use of the streaming TCP socket API provided by Bitcoincharts. If Bravenewcoin provided an API like this, a simple socket showing the trades or ticker data, I would use it instead. Otherwise it requires doing HTTP polling to get the data, as with [BitcoinAverage](

I didn't ask if they are machine washable. They seem durable. She's pretty responsive to emails, so you could try asking her.

There is an electrum fork for litecoin,  but it looks like it is out of date and I don't know if there are servers running for it.

I haven't had one for a few years. I can make and receive calls and texts using Google Voice and a SIP app on my iPod Touch or laptop, when there is wifi, which is most of the time, except when I'm in transit. When going on trips I get the directions before leaving. Occasionally I get lost and have to wander around for a while. I enjoy knowing that I'm saving money by not having a cell phone.

Ok, I'll try it out.

They had a page up earlier saying that they were switching servers (from a Mac Mini to a big rack machine with OpenSUSE).
In the meantime, if you want to use your coins before blockchain.info is back up, you can try importing your wallet.aes.json into MultiBit.

I bought some on Saturday and they came last night (5 days).

More etsy-style than ebay-style, but it's still good.

 lets you go short or long on BTC/USD, with leverage. It also has other stocks, commodities, etc. that you can take a position on.

I like the site, but I have been scammed several times on it. I am trying to make up the loss by choosing more carefully who to invest in.
The identity verifications do not do much. BTCJam doesn't release information or do anything when a borrower defaults.

If this goes well I would like to try the same at the Public Market in Rochester, NY.

How so?
@_date: 2013-10-11 15:27:25
I would go if there was wifi. I don't have a phone so I can't do it otherwise. Maybe it would be a good opportunity to help a friend set up a wallet though.
