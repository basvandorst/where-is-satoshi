Bitcoin is expected to be a currency for about 100 years, until 2124 or something like that. The time it'd take for building the technology, exploring the planet, building on the planet then settling there overlapping with civilization's use of Bitcoin isn't likely, mostly because we don't have the incentive to tale those steps yet. We're more likely to find ourselves mining asteroids for gold, ultimately devaluing the price of gold, though!

Not amateurs in economy or currency manipulation ����
@_date: 2017-02-05 05:41:22
I really don't believe there is much incentive to invest in mining anymore, you may not get a return on it with the difficulty as high as it is today

PH usually means Philly in the States so why would I think "international"
Edit: you talk about Europe, but what is Ph for?
@_date: 2017-02-26 16:02:34
It doesn't look like the tax you mentioned affects us 
You're the first person I'm hearing about it from so I looked for myself. It seems to only affect businesses
@_date: 2017-02-26 15:56:22
They don't share that propaganda anymore.
They recommend it to millenials 
What changed..? Why are they giving it legitimacy now? Why aren't banksters still shitting their pants?
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:45:37
Your username just says redditor for 11 days. Lol.
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:15:47
*your community
And by community you mean safe space.
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:21:13
Like micro-manage public forums.
@_date: 2017-02-26 15:09:56
They weren't amateurs, they were bankers.
@_date: 2017-04-30 21:52:30
Theres only been two all time highs and we're living in the most recent one. Just know when the price drops, it won't rise again for a long time so keep watch, hopefully you've established good connections with others in the know, online or wherever
Find community on Twitter esp. 
And be open to different opinions. We have a whole entire market of free currency now - a free market. I recommend looking into others as well. 
There's also sort of a civil war so in the btc community so it's just important you know that what the varying opinions are to make educated choices. Lots of opposition in this sub: 
Welcome aboard.

You're no keky, shame on you
@_date: 2017-04-30 21:36:18
Check out other cryptos, bitcoin isnt the only one out there, it just broke open the gate.
@_date: 2017-04-29 13:38:56
He's not conservative he's a puritan
@_date: 2017-04-05 15:00:14
What perfect timing right? 
@_date: 2017-04-29 13:36:25
It says right there,  that is his twitter handle.
@_date: 2017-04-29 13:49:22
Why is your username kekcoin
@_date: 2017-04-29 13:43:47
Ik what you meant, the guy is mislead though - sooo many people are. Bitcoin is damaged goods, dont be fooled by the bubble we have a whole entire market of currency now.
@_date: 2017-04-27 14:47:13
That's a pretty big accusation. 
Could it have been intentional? Yes; does it mean it's to shut it down? If that was where all their hard work went to, then why would they have made it so you can opt out? Why have they already fixed it? I think it was more to do with stats/spying
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:02:38
Exactly they are trying to make a new coin using bitcoin as their head start. It's disgraceful I lost my faith in bitcoin completely. Price doesn't reflect everything. Especially knowing whales who've invested everything are going to do everything they can to keep the hype up.
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:22:36
Will throw in the free pair of [bitcoin socks]( they gave me for waiting (they were on back order)
[Additional photos]( of the [unopened ]( wallet.
 
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:19:38
Nah just wish wash for the price to go down so they can buy more. Haha.
@_date: 2017-05-11 13:32:44
I have an extra Trezor! It's brand new if anyone wants to buy it, pm me &amp; I will send you photos/video of it and today's news/date
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:05:08
So why a chicken/rooster?
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:30:14
You yourself sound new. A bubble is a bubble is a bubble.
@_date: 2017-05-01 15:10:54
If this isn't the subreddit for posting sales can some one direct me to where to do that? Rbitcoinmarkets doesnt allow photos and I dont see any sales there.
@_date: 2017-05-01 16:53:16
Well, it's up to the individual to ask questions or for more photos. I thought this was an adult's subreddit - I think we are well aware of risks and how to manage in a community like we have here. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:29:11
Only because they had a merge.
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:12:04
You again
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:28:30
Yeah not second hand though, returning it to Czech wouldve cost me 32+ to ship it back. Pissed about that cuz now I'm stuck with it.
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:54:21
Why would you say that
We have the worst community
@_date: 2017-05-01 16:43:11
Yes and returning it to where they are (in Czech Republic) would cost me $32 so I decided to sell, pay shipping it'd cost within the US
@_date: 2017-07-13 21:20:00
why was this removed
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:57:32
Ahah that is a good question. New York and North Korea get special attention. It's in the fine print.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:40:16
Was this rly removed
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:20:07
The reason is because the black market is run by governments.
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:04:09
The way it is, is if you're buying and live in the states, this will ship to you faster. I waited three months to get mine, although I dis purchase while they were on backorder.
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:26:46
The what? You can't get that from the outside of a package... well then what do you recommend I do with a wallet that doesn't fit my needs anymore. I'm not investing into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-21 20:31:13
Yeah that was everywhere for a while. Just goes to show the masses are not always right.
@_date: 2017-07-13 21:20:27
wecan still read what you wrote here: 
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:36:50
Well if people are asking themselves this question that means they've only recently been introduced. So.
"Do you want to lose all your money?
If yes, enter the market now.
If no, keep watching and learning.
If downvoted, the bitcoin community cares too much about their own profit for their own good. Bitcoin has become a bad coin thanks to their god-company blockstream anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-04 16:49:21
I was just gonna say:
So much so that even the "crypto anarchy" is having a crypto anarchy.
