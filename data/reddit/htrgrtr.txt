Disappointing to see them reported as the "largest bitcoin exchange in the world by volume" without mention of their 0% trading fees.
Other than that, great news!

Well I think it's a reasonable assumption that "some" i.e. two or more out of the many in that list wouldn't have managed to get funding elsewhere, but you're right, there's no way of knowing the exact number.
As for Enron, sure they might be, but on average companies are a net positive; Enron and others in their ilk are a small percentage of all companies.

For large purchases in the UK, Coinfloor will get you the best exchange rate - localbitcoins can be expensive

They are the same as China's exchanges: 0 trading fees, only a withdrawal fee.
@_date: 2017-01-25 01:33:16
Sure, I've never tried it but it looks neat.
Google Play Reviews aren't kind though: BitPay app has 4.4* over 211 reviews, breadwallet has 3.2* over 69 reviews.
@_date: 2017-01-05 17:40:41
The Chinese volume is 100x the US because they have 0 trading fees and their withdrawal fees reduce as you trade more, so everyone trades back and forth to get the lowest fee.
This is a good link to read on the different exchanges and how they are best ranked.

There's some nuance but Coinbase does offer the ability to use their service while being completely unable to seize your funds from you.
When you store funds in the Vault product, you can either a) allow Coinbase to hold them in their cold storage (the 98%) or b) use the multi-sig "control funds yourself" option.
If you choose b, there is no way that Coinbase can take your funds, either from them being completely hacked or the government raiding all their offices - they're physically unable take them even if they wanted to. As linked above, there is an open source tool which allows you to recover your coins with the keys that you have.
Link to COinbase's blog introducing the product in 2014: 
"Our new Multisig Vault gives the customer complete control of their own private keys. Coinbase has no ability to move funds (which means you are safe from Coinbase being hacked, going bankrupt, or anyone seizing your bitcoin). It also means that you as a customer have much greater responsibility in storing your backup key securely. If you lose this backup and forget your multisig password, Coinbase cannot help you recover your bitcoin. For this reason, we only recommend this feature for advanced users."
You are right that the vast majority of people do not choose to use this feature, they use either the "Wallet" product, or the "Vault" product without the multi-sig option. Therefore, if Coinbase is thoroughly hacked, or the government raid them, then they will be able to take most of their coins (but none of those who use the multi-sig offering).
This again comes down to personal choice, and customers have mostly chosen to entrust Coinbase with the responsibility of managing their security rather than owning that themselves - they can switch to the other method whenever they like.

I'm in two minds about this:
1. Circle Pay without bitcoin is actually a good product on its own. Nothing revolutionary, but compared to similar apps its preferable: The best exchange rates between USD, EUR &amp; GBP compared to transferwise or other apps + a very slick design.
2. They used the bitcoin community when launching simply as a method to build a user base which resulted in a lot of people investing time getting set up onto the platform and recommending it to others as a BTC centric app. When they take that away it feels a bit like a betrayal, and 1* reviews are a result of that. 
Many companies boost themselves from communities that aren't aligned with their final vision for the product, but Circle shouldn't be surprised or angry when this is the reaction.

1) Coinbase offers the ability, through their "Vault" product, to have full control over your bitcoins. If Coinbase gets hacked, or the government seizes their property, they will be unable to hand over your coins. Users of their other "Wallet" product have made the decision that they would rather Coinbase hold their funds - they see Coinbase as better than holding the coins themselves. This is a free choice, not everyone will have the technological means to securely hold their own.
2) Coinbase is not just a bitcoin wallet. They integrate with the legacy banking system, which forces them to adhere to onerous regulations tracking users and with the possibility of seizing the funds they control. If they didn't adhere to these they would go to prison and Coinbase would not exist. Without Coinbase and other companies integrating with the legacy banking system, it is very difficult to onboard customers to bitcoin.
3) Coinbase is open about the rules they follow, they are not pulling the wool over your eyes. You can take out small cash deposits from the ATM, meet up in person through Mycelium, tumble your coins through Shapeshift to Monero then to Bitcoin if you want privacy. This isn't how a large % of the population will be onboarded to bitcoin.

For a brand new user, the BitPay wallet is far simpler, with a far cleaner UI, and is available for both android and iOS platforms.

Could you ELI5 the Itayose style?
@_date: 2017-05-04 11:57:59
I don't think so.
I just checked a volatility index and there's not a significant difference before and after (China fees were added in January 2017).

We saw the same surge because willybot on MtGox was autobuying millions of dollars of bitcoin - it was quite specific.
This time around I'm not sure bitfinex has enough pull that, even with its solvency in question, the rest of the worldwide market would follow it up.
