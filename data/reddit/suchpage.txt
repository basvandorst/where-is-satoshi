Hey dudes, is the drop tied to any recent bad news?  Or you think it just got to the tipping point where it had been going up for too long and a whale sold which led to other whales selling?  (Personally I just think it was the latter, if I had to guess.)

I am genuinely curious what would happen if someone were to put up a buy wall of 2,000 BTC at 6k.  A real buy wall, one that actually stays there, not a posturing/fake one that keeps disappearing.  Would it cause a bull trend, or would the powers that be (whatever entities that have multiple wallets of 200 btc) just poop right through it?
Anyone have a spare 12mil to try?
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:49:55
I mean, I've been pretty silent but optimistic ever since ATH.  Even after it popped and I accepted the fact that it was indeed a bubble popping, and I lost a lot, I was still optimistic.  But... dude, look at it.  It's still going down.
Similar comments like yours have been said ever since the ATH.  Each spike is just a disappointing reverberation from the ATH, and the ceiling/floor is lower each time.  Every time people have said there's no way it's going below X, and then it does anyway.
(Edit: I am still hopeful for BTC in the long run.  But right now, it's clearly dangerous.)
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:48:44
Well, I would be very happy if you're right.

Bitcoin is good
@_date: 2018-08-20 07:00:29
OK, thank you.  Is it usually quite this far down to ~4.7k though?  I had only ever seen it as low as ~7k.  But I'm willing to admit I just wasn't paying attention lol
@_date: 2018-08-08 15:57:53
Yeah, I'll be buying back in when the price flattens out, and obviously I'd buy more if it's very clear that another big bull trend is underway.  But this time, I will know to get out when I'm ahead. -_-
@_date: 2018-08-08 11:29:53
I hope I'm wrong, but I wouldn't recommend buying any BTC at all for a long while.  I think it's going to just continue to bleed for the following ~3 years before another ATH... although even that is not guaranteed because I'm certain it's heavily manipulated at this point.  (Just watching the exchange activity can confirm that.)
I'm not even putting limit buys at 4000... as I think it's going to drop to about 1900. (over several years, of course...)
But, again, I would love to be wrong.  And I genuinely do want BTC to succeed.
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:59:17
Yeah I get that, I was more replying to the sentiment of "We all need to do something to raise the price" and putting it in perspective that even if all of us spent 8000 USD into an existing sell wall, the price wouldn't even move +0.01.  I'm not sure that everyone was aware of that.
(And of course this works in reverse.  If there is a huge buy wall, and all of us sell simultaneously, BTC's price will not decrease 0.01 if they all sink into that buy order.)
Edit: And yes, those sell walls are a combination of posturing and ensuring that the price stays put (at that moment).  They are baiting people to sell, so it's a good idea to not base any trades off of them.  But I think many people see the big red bar, and they freak out and sell.
@_date: 2018-08-20 18:17:01
Thank you :)
@_date: 2018-08-08 12:13:31
Well, maybe you're right and 2k is too low, but I certainly don't think we're at the bottom yet, as much as it hurts me to say.  So I would just back away and observe the behavior, for quite a while.
(Edit: of course this is just my opinion, and I may be wrong and maybe the best price to buy in at is indeed 5k and it will start going back up, but I personally don't see that happening soon.)
@_date: 2018-08-08 12:01:13
See, I would also say there's no reason for the big players to have brought it down as low as it is now, though.  Why bring it from 20k to 6k to trade between 6k and 8k when we could still be trading between... 14k and 9k for example?
It's not like I'm calling anyone names or saying screw BTC, here.  I just think buying right now will get you burned.  Again, I repeat, I would love to be wrong.  I say this unsarcastically.  I want BTC to succeed.
@_date: 2018-08-20 06:50:22
I might be misunderstanding your meaning but I meant that the 24h volume is low, not the price (....although that's lowering too :))
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:53:25
Here's the thing that sucks about steep drops like these:  Even all of us on this reddit combined are largely powerless against sell walls of 50+ BTC.  Whenever these crashes occur, you can see at least one person (or bot/organization/entity) putting up a sell wall of 50+ BTC on the exchange, at the lowest allowed sell price, while the price is dropping.  The order adjusts IMMEDIATELY when the price lowers (the order is cancelled, and then repositioned at the bottom), which implies it is automated.
Let's say I was willing to pay $312,750.00 for 50 BTC RIGHT NOW.  If I do that, NOW, the price of BTC will not move up AT ALL, because there is a lame ass sell wall up of 55+ BTC as I type this.  (Of course, these orders can disappear and reappear at any time.)
There are also "regenerating" sell walls.  There will be an innocuous sell wall of 0.5 BTC or 1.0 BTC or something... but on the trade history, you see tons of green buy orders.  But... the sell wall won't go away and BTC's price is not increasing?!  Why is that?  Well, if you look closely, the "tiny" sell wall of 1.0 BTC is rapidly re-placing/re-adding new sell orders on top of itself instantaneously as they are filled.
Yeah, it's some of the most frustrating shit I've ever seen.  I know that it's unregulated but I'd be lying if I said I didn't wish that kind of shit wasn't so easy to do (provided that you have the money)

Did this only occur recently?  A month or so ago when GDAX was acting funky, I made a Twitter account for the first time ever.  I posted on GDAX's official Twitter, informing them that the service was down for some users. (On the status page, it said they'd fixed the problem, but it was still down for some users.)
The tweet wasn't angry or anything, just informing them of the problem.  I also replied to my own post, and attached a screenshot to show them the error code.  About 20 minutes later I added additional information that the login page was working fine, but when it transferred you to the trade window is when the problem occurred.  That was it.  Three, calm tweets that contained only information to attempt to help their dev team fix the problem.  Seconds after the third tweet, I was banned from Twitter for "suspicious activity".  The account recovery system was asking me for my personal cell number in order to "verify my identity" which I refused to do.  (Even Facebook still does not have my number.)
I made a ticket explaining that I shouldn't have to give them my cell number for being erroneously flagged as malicious because the fault was not mine, it was a faulty detection algorithm.  This ticket was marked as solved but I was not unbanned.  I made a second ticket.  This time, they apologized and unbanned me.  Regardless, I'll not be using Twitter ever again if their "naughty behavior" detection is THAT sensitive and paranoid.

Coinbase Pro 24h volume was that low at the time of my comment
@_date: 2018-08-20 06:29:52
Volume is under 5000 on Coinbase Pro right now -- I haven't really been keeping up with things lately -- I don't think I've ever seen the volume quite THAT low, or is that typical of the time of week?
I don't honestly know a lot about volume and what low and high volumes "mean" but I have a suspicion that low volume = higher chance for bots to manipulate the price. (Right?)

For real - why ISN'T there a daily discussion for May 11th yet?  Isn't that a little weird?

Watching on gdax as literally ONE person with 50 BTC single-handedly drives the BTC price from 7500 to 7370... over the course of about 5 minutes.  By doing this:
Put up a sell order for 50 BTC at the lowest boundary.
Wait a couple seconds!
See if anybody panic sells.
No?  No one panic sold?
Okay.  Remove the sell order.
Wait a couple seconds!
Put the exact same sell order back up.  Repeat.
Eventually, someone gets intimidated by the big red block and panic sells, which causes more people to panic sell.  Meanwhile the 50 BTC guy is just moving his sell order down every time, but never actually selling any of HIS btc.
His stash is perfectly intact -- he will sell his later -- while everybody else loses their minds and loses all their coin.
Sigh. :(

Depending on how you define the begin/end of the drops, there have been 6 consecutive drops over the last 2.5 days with no bounce (no rise that lasted more than 10min).  So...analysis based on nothing:  bounce soon.  Not a moon bounce obviously, just another shitty one.

Hey everyone, made a reddit account just now just to ask this question as it's been confusing and bugging the hell out of me.
I'm somewhat new to crypto and have messed around a little bit on GDAX, nothing too serious.  What I don't understand is every time I see this... 
At the literal lowest point of a 24 hour span, so why are people selling whatsoever?  Wouldn't you typically want to sell on a high point of the day?!  I know the joke is "buy high sell low is the way" ... but no, really, seriously, why does this happen?  And I do understand the fear of losing everything, and I can totally understand selling WHILE it's still freefalling.  But once it's reached the bottom of an arch, and levelled out due to resistance, where does the urge to "nope, I still wanna sell!" come from?
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:31:15
Hey everyone, made a reddit account today just to ask this question as it's been confusing and bugging me.  And, I accidentally posted this on yesterday's topic, so I'm re-posting here instead...
I'm new to cryptocurrency and have messed around a little on GDAX, nothing too crazy. What I'm confused about is every time I see this: 
It's at the literal lowest point of a 24-hr span, so why is ANYONE selling at all? If one was to sell at all, wouldn't one typically want to sell on a HIGH point of the day?! I know the joke is "buy high sell low" ... but guys, really, seriously, why does this happen? And yes, I do understand the fear of losing everything, and I can totally understand selling WHILE it's in a freefall. But once it's reached the bottom of an arch, and "straightened out" like in the pic due to resistance, whey would anyone still think "Nope!  I still wanna sell!" ?
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:53:40
I second the "So?"  Pretty much every post here is speculation, and nothing wrong with that, because it's all we got.  If nobody posted speculation, there'd be basically no posts here.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:19:41


I understand what you mean, but the pic could be the opposite -- a steadily increasing price where the current price is the highest it's ever been in the last 24 hrs.  At this moment, one might decide "Okay well, it's the highest it's ever been in the past 24 hours, I think I'll sell now because I feel like it might drop sometime later today."  True, they could be wrong and it just keeps rising instead.  But anyway, my point is that it seems it would only make sense if -- it's at the lowest point it's ever been in the past 24 hrs -- to hold rather than to sell.  I dunno.
