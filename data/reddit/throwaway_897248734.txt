To be fair he only states his personal, as I understand educated, opinion on the issue.

can you explain that for a newbie? How do I concentrate ?

This could gradually grow to be a serious problem, yes? 
Transaction fees are already increasing at an unusual rate these days, though that is also linked to the sudden increase in transaction volume, if I understand correctly.
Thanks for explaining!

Hey, look at this transaction of mine with an arguably low fee of *50 sat/byte* that caused me random anger attacks approx. 10 days ago:
I made the transaction on *Feb 6* at around *5pm* and it got confirmed on on *Feb 8* at *12.50am*(uh...noon). **Almost 44 hours.**
Honestly I had lost all hope after having it unonfirmed for more than 2 hours. The longest it had taken up to that day was 15 minutes.

Wow, now I feel bad for making you feel like a dick. All good man. I hope you're doing well now!

While I'm generally in favor of a progressive criminal justice system that puts an emphasis on rehabilitation and prevention via education and social programmes, I don't see how armed robbery, in most cases, can be justified as a last resort for those in financial distress. 
So why on earth would you want to go to Australia.

Sweet. Once it rises a little higher I will sell all my 130 mBTC for that sweet profit of $7. 
See y'all on the Bahamas.

I agree 100%.

No need to apologize man, that's terrible to hear. I decided against posting it, but originally I was going to add that I can see why people sell drugs or maybe do small-time stealing. Armed robbery is a whole different issue.
I'm looking forward to the day that people will look back and recognize how many lives have been needlessly destroyed because of the tyrannical prison and criminal justice system in the USA. 
As a fellow..*enthusiast* and human being I'm sorry to say this, but your ass was sold to the prison lobby by your government.

[Newb alert]I mean, I can see that it does pretty much determine the willingness of miners to put in the effort. However, seeing as we're pretty far into the game and the majority of Bitcoins have already been mined, I think the relation is rather weak by now?
Does this mean that the high cost is itself supposed to deter more miners? I'm very confused.

Hi I'm new to all this, so please forgive me if this is a stupid question: Why exactly is the computation cost kept high intentionally? What purpose does it serve?
Isn't the value of XBT supposed to be determined purely by market forces anyways?
