You're intentionally picking situations that don't align with each other. The fact that you have to do so proves my point. The question isn't "Who's life is harder if the rich person is plagued with mental issues and the poor person is normal but broke?" The question is who's life is harder if they've both got mental issues? Pretend otherwise if you want, but it's obvious that the person 1 paycheck away from living on the street is in a tougher position.

No, my argument is that they have it easier because of circumstances of birth, and that makes them privileged. It doesn't even have to be about rich vs poor. I grew up in a lower middle-class household and worked hard for what I have, but I don't pretend that my life is as hard as someone who grew up in poverty. I don't worry about when I might eat next or wonder if the cop who just pulled me over is going to shoot me. That's privilege. Happiness doesn't enter into it, I'm not sure why you bring that up.

The resentment comes in when both people are at X, one of them started at A and the other started at T, but T acts as though he worked just as hard as A to wind up in the same place.

You missed the point of my analogy. A and T are on the same path. If points U, V, and W are alcoholism, drugs, and sock fetishes, both people passed through them to get to X. In T's case that's *all* they had to contend with, not so with A.

It's an analogy. That's how analogies work. Speaking in real world terms, I still stand by my point. As a whole, people born into privileged lives have an easier time than those who did not. *That's why we call them privileged.* If you somehow managed to survey every multimillionaire in the world I have no doubt that the hardships faced by those who were born rich and managed to stay that way would not come close to those born into poverty and worked their way up. Quit being pedantic.

My mom just sticks with "the bitcoin."

Some other things to remember:
Most people prefer to avoid hassles, and dealing with multiple exchanges/wallets/hardware wallets/etc. is much more of a hassle than just using Coinbase, even if the fees are high.
Right now BTC is a shitty currency but a good (if risky) investment, I see lots of people in this sub talking about novice users "missing the point" of bitcoin when the reality is they probably don't care. They like buying $100 worth of BTC and a few weeks later it's worth $200. It offers potentially significant returns on very short timescales compared to traditional investing which is what drives most of the hype.

I'm not talking about risk. I'm talking about effort.  Having a larger pool of starting cash gives a person more options. You can't buy a property in New York for $1000 and resell it in 10 years for a huge profit, for example.

That means almost nothing in the real world. Turning a million dollars into a billion takes generally far, far less effort than turning a thousand into a million.

You thoroughly misunderstand my point. I never said that being wealthy = a life free of hardships, or that those hardships are automatically less than those who are not as well off. What I *am* saying is that in situations with similar hardships, it is almost always to your benefit to be in a more privileged position when facing them.
Health or mental problems? Being able to afford care or take needed time off beats having those problems and an inability to do anything about it.
Got laid off or otherwise lose your job? Being able to survive on savings for at least a month or two beats unpaid bills after your first missed check.
I challenge you to find a hardship where being well off doesn't help in *some* way. A death in the family is pretty much the only one I can think of.

I don't get how their fees work. I bought $100 when it was 8k and paid $2.99 in fees. Set up a weekly buy @ $20 and paid $1.49. That ain't no 1%
Edit: both transactions were from a savings account

I first bought at 8000, while I certainly don't regret it, I still wish I had gotten in sooner.
