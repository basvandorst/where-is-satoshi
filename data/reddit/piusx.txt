You have a point if and when Bitcoin is an asset that Banks/funds can transfer money into electronically and instantly.  The ETF and second market product are essential for this to occur. 
The counterattack by the banking lobby with New York regulatory hurdle was a very smart move on their part(obviously I do not like it).  They have stopped the Wikkivoss ETFin it's tracks of it sticks.
Either way Bitcoin is here to stay.  I hope it succeeds sooner rather than later.

Bitcoin wins or they win.  I either lose my entire investment in Bitcoin or I become the new Bank.  There is no middle ground in this fight.

We can make some educated guesses what Bitcoin would look like.  Bitcoin will be a deflationary in the near future.  We do know that deflationary assets rise in value over time.  People usually hold/hoard assets that increase in value.  
You are correct in your question. ...... How will governments collect taxes?
This will be a challenge for governments in the Bitcoin world.   First governments will lose some power because they will not be able to control spending by printing money.  So we can predict that governments will lose some of their power over people.
One example from the USA.  In the past 10+ years the USA has fought several wars.  We can predict that in the Bitcoin world it will be much harder for governments to fight wars of aggression because they will not be able to print FIAT/Monopoly money to pay for the wars.
I completely agree that we cannot know with any certainty what the Bitcoin world would look like, but we can make some good guesses based on history.  We also look at the logic/nature of deflationary assets/currencies.
Thank you for your post!  I have really enjoyed the discussion!

This article is very good news for long term success of the Bitcoin Network.  The Network needed to be built first.  Yes the miners are being rewarded for the investment made.  Let me give a quick example.
I own bitcoins.  Without the Bitcoin miners I would have no network to spend/use my bitcoins.  The unit of exchange is dependent on the Bitcoin Network/Protocal.  If I lose my bitcoins the Bitcoin Network does not shut down.  Thus it was essential that the people willing to provide the investment are compensated for their investment.  
Another analogy is easier to see.  Let us say I want to open a pizza shop.  I cannot tell the builders "I will pay you after two years because I am waiting till I profit selling pizza".
Even a decentralized network has a structure.  The people willing to invest in the structure deserve instant payment.  I invested in the unit of exchange bitcoin.   Sadly, I will have to wait a bit longer to be compensated....

I think the strength of your piece is the framework.  The Bitcoin network is a profound tool that will transform everything at the macro and micro level.  I agree 100% that the Russians could cripple the USA by supporting Bitcoin.  I am waiting for the morning I wake up and bitcoin value skyrockets on news - Russia (or Google or China) announces that they have 1-3 million bitcoins and want to see it used as the global currency in international transactions.
I have some basic reasons the BRIC nations are skeptical of Bitcoin.
1) All the faces of Bitcoin are American
2) Even the BRIC nations are Fiat currencies
3) Because they are Fiat currencies they are scared bitcoin could expose their currencies vulnerabilities

This is the point that people need education about.  I am getting down voted because I sounded harsh, but the article was more of a marketing campaign than an honest appraisal of an exchange that is using leverage in their business model.

Let me try to explain a spread trade because that is what happens when you buy one asset and sell another.
When you buy Bitcoin and sell USD it does affect the price of each if done with enough value/size.
Yes it would make a difference in USD price.  You are correct the physical dollars will still be paper.  The paper will not be worth as much as before.  Think of Zimbabwe.  Yes the paper money is still there, but now you need to carry it in a wheel barrel instead of a wallet!

Ok.  Let us assume you have a valid point for argument sake.
Prop shops usually are trading intraday.  They do not hold "long term" positions.  
For them to be successful they need two things.
1- cheap fees 
**all Bitcoin exchanges have high fees this prop shops not in game yet**
2- many retail investors who want short term profits
**majority of investors are in for the long term right now**
So to review. I do agree prop shop will have an opportunity to make short term profits, but the environment is not good for them at this time.  Price is not rising this not many retail/short term retail buyers.  Also currently there is not a cheap exchange with large volume.  This will come in the future!

Please everyone see the big picture.  Walmart would **NOT** be around if it was not for the fiat ecosystem.  They owe there existence to American laissez Faire capitalism.  You remove the excess fiat money supply and their out of business.
Politically it is a dangerous move for them to accept bitcoin.  Yes they could save money in the short term, but in the long term they would be supporting a deflationary currency.  
They depend on inflation.  They want people to buy in bulk for cheap.  This works when the ignorant populous believes the money in their pocket will lose value over time.  
If you have Bitcoin in your pocket then you will not be incentivised to buy bulk because you want to keep your electronic gold as long as possible.  People will begin to buy what is needed in smaller amounts and enjoy waking up to savings that increase in value.
If I was Walmart I would refuse Bitcoin also.  It will destroy their ability to profit in the long term.

This is a question of your personal responsibility.  Do you believe you should pay taxes because you are a member of the community? 
If you believe your government is evil and you do not want to pay taxes how are you going to better your community by hiding your income?  At this time I believe it is a legitimate act if defiance to refuse I pay your taxes(I do pay my taxes).  However you must find a way to use the tax savings to support your community.  
For example,  if you make 50,000 usd a year.  You refuse to pay your taxes because you believe the government uses your tax money to fight unjust wars.  Then I believe you must take 25% of your income to invest in something that will help people.  Donate 12,500 in charity, victims of war, etc. 
 Avoiding taxes to get hoard wealth I believe is immoral.  Refusing to pay taxes because your government is immoral is an act of war/defiance.  The moral thing to do if then give away a percentage of your income.
Thank you for your post!
FYI - I pay my taxes!

Do you believe the community should restrict and/or discourage financial instruments that harm the majority of people?  Or at least harm one side of the deal?  The inflationary currencies promote risk taking because people have to increase risk to keep up with the loss of value in their currency.  I have to give you one MAJOR point Bitcoin is all theory now.  It is not deflationary.  It does not hold the properties I am using in this debate.  It needs to grow massively in market cap to even have the principles I am using in this debate
Do you believe inflationary fiat currencies actually promotes unhealthy financial decision making?  
A deflationary currency will promote more savings, and discourage risk taking.  So I agree I will continue to make mistakes as a human, but society should also not encourage risk taking behaviour.  
You do touch on one major topic that could be discusses.
Should the community attempted to protect td citizens from excessive risk taking?  If the answer is yes then Bitcoin is a better option than fiat because fiat promotes risk.  Yes individual will still make stupid mistakes, but it will not be community supported this less frequent.

One suggestion for you.  People will need a visual of the exchange rate to understand how they hide fees in the rate. You are losing a bit in paragraph format.  Next time you post or reply you should have a link to entire cost of each transaction.  
Even have a real world example.  Every month as a marketing tool send $25 USD via WU and $25 USD via Rebit.
Every month post the link to the real world example.  This way you will not be spending your time replying to each post.  
And the hoarders of bitcoin can help you market your website service by sending the link everywhere.

Imagine if Google made Bitcoin it's currency and provided a secure wallet for every google email or android app.
Either way Bitcoin is bad news for Apple.  I cannot envision a way Apple could capitalise on Bitcoin success.

I would argue that the remittance does not need to be built.  It needs to be decentralized/deconstructed.  For example lets say we are brothers.  You live in are home village in Philippines, and I live in USA.  I have a coinbase account.  Our dad needs $100 USD for medicine.  I immmediately send the bitcoin to you.  Now the challenge is converting the bitcoin to the PH Peso.  Let us assume you already have an account or contact someone via Local Bitcoin who makes you a market.  So in reality all that is needed is a social network to put honest people together.  This will be cheaper for the simple reason that you do not have to pay for currency exchange booth, electricity, etc.  Now we cannot forget that someone on the Philippines side will have to make a market in Peso/BTC. 


**1** Bitcoin Network already established and successful
**2** Value of Bitcoin could not even handle the Filipino remittance market at the 6 billion market cap (assuming it had 100% of Filipino market).  People think 6 billion market cap is large.  Think about the size of the daily remittance market.  I did a Google search and the Filipino remittance market is 21 billion a year.  That is a daily remittance of 55 million a day.  This is only one country.  Let us assume tomorrow Filipinos used only Bitcoin for their remittance.  The daily volatility in bitcoin would be massive.  I am making a lot of assumptions, and look forward to hearing some feedback.  
**3** Bitcoin is simple.  So simple that everyone thinks they can make a bigger and better bitcoin.  **BUT** its simplicity is why it will succeed over the long haul.  It is simple and has not failed us since inception.  This down market in the last 30-60 days has been good for the long term viability of bitcoin.  Bitcoin has gained market share in the crypto space.  This means people trust it more than other crypto over the long term.
Hope I have answered your questions.  Thank you very much for your thoughtful questions.  The interaction with other bitcoiners is a great joy.

I agree with many of your comments.  I am holding Bitcoin for the reasons you point out.  I am a hoarder.  
I do believe at the market cap we currently have some internet company could utilise Bitcoin to their advantage. 
I also think the mass adoption by retailers could have a detrimental effect on Bitcoin price.  Small Bitcoin investors cannot stop the downward slide in price alone.

The reason people see nothing wrong with margin trading is they do not understand compound interest.  A bit of history about compound interest.  Until the 14th century the entire civilized world (leaving China out .. I mean Christian and Muslim world) viewed interest as **USURY**.  Charging compound interest was an act of slavery.  
The cancer of **USURY** cannot be eradicated quickly.  It will be a slow process with much volatility. 
Since you and I agree **USURY** is the cancer now we have to refine our definition.  You said "the cancer is firmly entrenched in Bitcoin".  I will disagree with you there.  The problem is Bitcoin is very tiny compared to USD currency.  The exchanges can easily borrow from Fiat banks to offer margin trading.  This system will never die, but it will become much harder to borrow USD to trade Bitcoin when/if Bitcoin becomes the reserve currency. From what I read a 500 bitcoin order moved the market the other day.  
Lets examine this
500 bitcoins * 500 = 250,000 usd
so with current margin system of 10-1 a trader only needs $25,000 to move bitcoin market.
Now lets assume Bitcoin grows to a 800,000,000,000 market cap (100 times now).  
To borrow on 10-1 leverage in USD would cost
500 bitcoins * 50,000 = 25,000,000
would need 2.5 million to trade this size on margin
The larger Bitcoin becomes the less influence margin will have.  I believe Bitcoin will survive and flourish.  These short term attacks give the impression that Bitcoin has indeed become infected by the Fiat currency cancer, but it is an illusion.  When Bitcoin grow to become the elephant in the room no one will want to take the Fiat loan to trade on margin.
How many Banks will accept Argentine currency as margin currency?  How about Zimbabwe currency?  It will be this way with all Fiat currencies someday.   
@_date: 2014-08-16 09:54:51
I agree with that completely.
@_date: 2014-08-16 01:58:48
However until trust is inherent in Bitcoin mass adoption will not be possible.

Trust and Faith are required.  
When I buy Bitcoin I must **trust** the private key is Bitcoin.
When I keep my savings in Bitcoin I must have **faith** that it will have value tomorrow, one year, five years.
When I keep my saving in Bitcoin I must **trust** that  Bitcoin will not  print more than 21 million Bitcoins.

Your simple reply hit it on the head!
The marketing strategy of modernity is **"the world is complicated and I(snake oil salesman) have the magic pill for you"**
The reason people switch from Bitcoin to anything else comes down to one simple reason.  They say to themselves "**bitcoin is way to simple to succeed .... I need the magic pill from the snake oil salesman**"

@_date: 2014-08-16 05:14:23
Agreed.  Fiat will continue to exist.  However if and when the dollar loses its dominance people will demand more accountability of the Fiat currencies.  
For example let us make up a future Fiat and call it IPA island.  The government says there currency will be backed by Bitcoin between 4/1 to 6/1 depending on how economy is doing.
The new **Bitcoin Worldview** will demand the following.
The wallet name on blockchain showing how many Bitcoin are held by IPA government.  If they attempt to sell any community would know instantly.
The IPA currency would be crypto currency and the public would see exactly how many units of currency are in system.
Much more honest.  Much less leverage.  
What are your thoughts on my example?

Great article.  Some key takeaways.  Wall Street is massive because of Fiat money.  If Bitcoin succeeds most of their activity will be reduced.
Please try to contemplate what I am going to say.
**In a Bitcoin ecosystem leverage would be greatly reduced thus trading activity would not be as prominent as in fiat system**
As a result as Bitcoin grows in value leverage will reduce over time
@_date: 2014-09-16 12:51:13
**1** Bitcoin has not broken
**2** Bitcoin is very simple after you get an understanding of it compared to fiat for Joe the user
**3** Bitcoin solves the centralized issue that all money before it including Gold had.  Even gold had to be defended.
**4** Bitcoin does not have to solve every problem under the sun.  It only needs to keep from breaking
**5** I am thankful I watched this snake oil salesman because I will ignore the price until the halving in 2016!
**TAKE MY ADVICE** Many people are going to say bitcoin is too simple and needs an upgrade.  They will play on your insecurities trying to make themselves seem smarter and better than bitcoin.  All of them are wrong.  Bitcoin is the future.   
@_date: 2014-08-23 10:10:35
I agree.  Observing price action on negative news I am starting to thing negative news is good for Bitcoin.  The more fired that burn, but have no effect on the network the more people see The Bitcoin network as a separate decentralized network.  Once people begin to realize the network is here to stay price could strengthen.
In reality there is no reason for Bitcoin businesses to be located in overpriced New York anyway.

Used as a tactical approach, re-pricing Bitcoin would reduce a threat that the USA wields. What happens long term after that I have no idea, War always leads to unpredictable outcomes.
One thing however remains certain. Money (as a system) is only ever a symbolic representation of hard assets. And the BRICS retain those hard assets regardless of which payment systems are in use.
Could you please explain "Brics retain hard assets".  Are you referring to Gold in India and energy in Russia?

Hoarders of Bitcoin
Anti usury
Anti fiat currency
Anti modern banking
Anti fractional banking
Anti aggression warfare (USA today)
Anti big government regulation
Pro small community
Pro fare banking
Pro small community banking
Pro direct lending without usury
Pro micro lending without usury
Pro rational discussion
Also the hoarders understand that we cannot win the war against the banks and big governments with AK-47 and Missals.  We must dry up their funding.  Destroy fiat currency, and they cannot fight their evils wars.
I am a hoarder because I am a warrior.  A wise warrior uses the weapons that can win the war!  Bitcoin is my weapon and I will not spend it until fiat currency is on its death bed.  
How will I know Bitcoin is winning the war?
Wars of aggression dissipate

Bitcoin price is 20-100 times higher
Bitcoin users are jailed and even killed for using Bitcoin in large numbers
There is know way Bitcoin will be adopted without a fight!!

Let me give you my answers.

To answer your question let's look at the major cities of New Yirk and Chicago.  Who populates the office buildings?  A good percentage is banking, derivatives, and large insurance companies. How did they get funds to pay for the massive rents and salaries?? By charging compound interest ( **usury** ). 
Now let us look at the bitcoin ecosystem.  Can people and companies charge compound interest? Yes and it will happen however remember we as wallet holders are our own bank.  As a result I hope the Bitcoin ecosystem is more local and grassroots.  When friends help each other they do not charge interest rate that make the borrower feel as if they are enslaved.
Also if Bitcoin is a deflationary currency charging a flat interest rate will be challenging.  For example let's say I am a pig farmer and I borrowed 10 bitcoins from you.  My annual income from selling pigs is 10 bitcoins a year.  We must remember in a bitcoin ecosystem (in theory) the bitcoins rise in value and the products reduce in price.  Thus me as a pig farmer in Bitcoin ecosystem should be comfortable making less bitcoins each year because they buy more things. So if I borrow for you the only fare way to pay you back is a profit sharing loan.  I give you percentage of income. 
The Bitcoin ecosystem is all theory.  I hope it brings a more charitable and just community.  Now we a all dogs competing for crumbs.

I remember I made my first purchase right before the large move up to $1200.  I was very vocal about Bitcoin at the time.  When the price went above $1000 I had many friends tell me to take some profits.  My answer was "I believe in Bitcoin as a alternative to the evil system we have.  I am not selling."  When it came crashing down I looked like a clown.  Since then I have also bought more Bitcoins, and I will continue purchasing Bitcoins. It is the only way I can fight back effectively against the evil fiat system we have now.
In 5-10 years the price of Bitcoin could be 0 or 1000....? Either way I will own Bitcoin.

I would describe myself as a bitcoin hoarder.  I do believe the current world economic system is evil and corrupt.  The powers who are keeping this system alive should see me as the enemy.  The wonderful thing about bitcoin is it provides a way to counterattack ......... and if my side wins the following outcomes will occur

You are correct my word choice was irrational.  My apologies.
In my opinion the current fiat system is not set up to support stable communities.  Stable communities require stable currencies and low inflation or no inflation.  Stable communities are focused on supporting families so they can raise the children in a safe environment.  High inflation communities support spending consumption.  I know I am generalizing, but it is to show why the banking system does see Bitcoin as a threat.  I agree with you they are not interested in incorporating it into their business.  That is because they know if they did profits would disappear.
Bitcoin is a game changer.  We will not need the current multi national banking system if Bitcoin succeeds.  We will still need local banking/credit unions.
The banks will do everything in their power to keep Bitcoin price low because of a couple reasons
 Bitcoin owners would have enough wealth to become their own banks
The price would allow for larger transactions which would result in large commodities being purchase with it - oil, grains, etc
The higher Bitcoin price would bring a magnifying glass to the underbelly of the fiat system which would could lead to a catastrophic collapse
Thanks again for pointing out my irrational word choice

Central, commercial, and investment banks can be lumped together for the example because they all have the same foundation fiat currency.

PayPal could make this a win win by doing the following.
1) offer bitcoins as payment option
2) Buy bitcoins until have 10% of float (1.3million?)
If they do both they are hedged against reduction in fees when Bitcoin use explodes.  Then they could continue there business with lower fees.  Also when Bitcoin network is established EBAY could begin promoting itself as not only a big garage sale, but the decentralised marketplace of Bitcoin.

Yes.  Very good point.  The crusades were supported by local communities.  
Lets talk about them for a bit.  Please note I am not discussing if crusades were just or not.   
The way the crusades worked is someone said "We are having a crusade for this purpose"  
Then people decided to support the crusade/war or they did not.  There were many crusades that never took place because they were not funded.  
Now imagine if we had this system now!!!
We are going to war  ..... 
Do you support or not??
If yes  - please give your son as warrior and 10 bitcoins
If no - live peacefully

I agree.
One point I ignored because it did not fit in with theme of post is exactly what you hit upon.
The transition will not be easy!  Volatility is natural when coming off addictive behaviour.  The current fiat system is like a heroin, crack, meth, alcohol addiction.  The transition off this addictive substances will create massive pain which in economic terms translates into volatility.
We who see and understand the **BITCOIN MINDSET** have a responsibility to make the halfway house as comfortable as possible.  We must give the addict a vision of what the Bitcoin community will look like.  We must explain to them that leverage and addictive behaviour will keep them from seeing and understanding Bitcoin EVEN if they use Bitcoin.
Thank you for sharing!

I agree they never speak of bitcoin.  They did give solid evidence that all the wars of the past 14 years were fought to defend the dollar. There is solid evidence that this is true.

I agree with your **if**
Yes it could be used for fractional reserved banking.  The big difference will be two fold.  
First the Bitcoin technology as provided transparency that no government will be able to fabricate.  If tomorrow Argentina says they will back their currency with 2 million Bitcoin at 10 percent reserve. They would have to provide the world the bitcoin wallet for everyone to see.  
Secondly now that Bitcoin is transparent people will ask for the same transparency in the Argentinian coin.  Where are the 20 million (2*10) Argentina peso crypto currency?
So fractional reserve banking done in a crypto currency world will be much more honest.  Do you agree?

One false comparison I see from many in finance is the following
Middleton said (forgot what video)
Current derivative market is 225 trillion
If Bitcoin is used solely there would 225 trillion ..........
Well we must remember if Bitcoin is adopted the "extra" leverage will also vanish!  When he gave his demo he used 100% funded contract.  Well most bank traders or hedge fund traders are only 5-15 funded for overnight positions.  If they use Ultra-Coin they will basically be trading cash positions.  Do you agree this will be an issue?  Or at least will shrink the trading communities power?
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:25:08
One additional point.
Angel investors are investing in companies.  I believe the coin will have a better long term return as an investment compare to the companies building on the network because the Bitcoin network will always destroy profit margins.

@_date: 2014-08-23 02:56:45
I agree.  Why not wait to publish your findings until after you have completed all audits over time.  If you are margin exchange a stress test audit needs to be done.  You have to admit that the article did imply that this Bitcoin audit showed that you are 100% funded which is a bit of a stretch.


This might be true, but obviously your marketing and sales force are stronger than your risk department.  If your CRO (chief risk officer) was strong he would have told you **not** to publish incomplete audit which implies lower risk.  The CRO would have said for the long term viability of the company we will wait until we complete all risk audits.  Also the best minds from MIT and IVY League built the Fiat nightmare of 2008-2009 banking crash.
**My apologies** for the analogy about the dirty apartment.  After reading your response I do see your point that it might be misconstrued.  I will remove the analogy.  Thank you for pointing out were I went overboard.  Maybe you should follow my lead and stop publishing parts of your audit until you **complete a thorough audit including - bank fiat audit, Bitcoin audit, and stress test audit**. 


I would like to focus on the word competitive.  This is a very scary term when we focus on risk.  How much are you willing to compromise a true audit to make sure you pass with flying colours?  
Let me give example:  
You see from internal audit that your funds and system can handle a $300 swing, but over 600 and the stress test will show vulnerabilities in your funding.  Do you do the 300 or 600 audit.  Obviously you do the 300 to show you are competitive.  
In review, I applaud your honest reply to my comments.  I will remove the analogy that could be misconstrued.  I believe you should have waited until you finished a more thorough audit before publishing partial findings.  I wish you the best of luck as a business.
One final question.  Could the margin exchange agree on a stress test model and publish the model first?  The risk community can decide if your **stress test model** is sound for the potential volatility of Bitcoin.
Thank you for your time ,

@_date: 2014-08-22 13:03:42
Have you done a stress test?
Do you allow margin trading?
If you allow margin trading do you have additional funds to cover a dramatic move to the upside?
Basically how can you be 100% funded if you allow margin trading?
For example, if I open and account(USD for example) and decide to buy bitcoin on 5-1 margin.  So today bitcoin is trading at 500 my investment is 100, and I have 100 in cash to cover downside move.  If bitcoin moves to 2500 in one day do you have 1900 in reserves to pay me for the profit i deserve for going long?
long from 500
100 invested
2400 - 500 paid for bitcoin = 1900
Let us assume you did purchase .2 bitcoin with 100 deposit.
Then $1900 - 500 = $1400 outstanding (reserves needed)
In review do you have **$1400** in reserves for dramatic move to the upside for 5-1 leverage position?
When leverage is used **snap shot** audit is like standing in a war zone during a cease fire with 1000 warriors armed to the teeth.  When the auditor is asked was there peace?  Yes not a shot was fired.  News a week after audit "200 fighters killled after auditor leaves war zone"
Please I work in the derivative/futures business.  Leverage = bankruptcy for someone sometime.
@_date: 2014-07-30 10:39:28
Thank you for your response
I do not believe Saudi Arabia is a good comparable.  They are hedging their oil reserve which is a known asset in their country.  
The tobacco example is very good.  I agree with you.  The tobacco companies are introducing e-cigarettes because they see the writing on the wall.  Big tobacco is hoping that by introducing fancy electric smokes they can keep there monopoly on tobacco farming, the devices, and market share.  I believe they will lose in the long run because people will realize they can buy bulk tobacco and humidors(e-cigarette) cheaper on the internet.  Tobacco farmers also will realize they can make more money selling directly to consumers.  
How is tobacco monopoly like the fiat banks?  Well to compete with Bitcoin they must find a way to convince the public that there JP Morgan centralized coin is better than Bitcoin.  The reason they will not be successful in the long run is Bitcoin is exposing the weak, corrupt, evil foundation of the banking system before they can get their marketing campaign going.  
BTW - the finance industry already has crypto coins.  The entire banking system is electronic money.  How can the better a system they already use in a very secretive, collusive, and evil fashion?  Bitcoin is a reaction to the dishonest electronic money the fiat banking system already uses.

The important thing to pay attention to for the next year or so is who gains/loses market cap in the crypto currency space in panic  times (downturns).

Good sign for Bitcoin long term.
@_date: 2014-07-30 12:31:52
Agreed if we define property in that fashion. 
If the banks incorporated Bitcoin into their business model they would be forced to use that definition.  Any profit they made off Bitcoin would be dwarfed by the losses in their fiat electronic business as it came crashing down.

I am not technical, however Bitcoiners are not riding on a high horse.  We are riding on a market cap of 7.5 billion that has withstood
Mt gox
Silk Road
Numerous countries banning Bitcoin
Stolen wallets
Price volatility
And the price is not crashing and it works!  I started to invest in Bitcoin in 2013.  Without the grassroots support and investment from the believers at the beginning I would not be able to become part of this movement.
Ethereum is different.  It is a marketing campaign.  In a sense it is arrogant.  It is going the direction of fiat ipo market ... Give me money because I am smart and can deliver a product in the future that will change everything....... Do not pay attention to the fact that i(ethereum)do not even have a product that is ready for production.  I am not slamming Ethereum.  When looking for seed money you must sell yourself as if it was occurring today.  You have to make the investor see the dream as reality (arrogance).
In review Bitcoin is not arrogant it **HAS A TRACK RECORD**!  If you take offense to the history of Bitcoin and the confidence this brings to the community please do not call us arrogant.  We are a diverse group of people who have realized that this currency/technology/community of diehard believers is and will change the world.  Ethereum is a dream.  Some dreams come true, but most disappear like when thewind disperses the clouds.  
@_date: 2014-08-10 01:52:30
I think it is prudent to hold and hoard at this time.  Buying and selling actively is not a smart move because you run the risk of losing your Bitcoins on an exchange (mt gox).    
Also I believe the move from 500ish to 2000 and above will be a quick move with very little liquidity between 500-2000.  So if I sell at 1000 I am not guaranteed I will be able to get back into Bitcoin at or below my sale price. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 10:07:54
I agree with your comment.  A secure saving medium. Is suppose to have minimal risk.  Bitcoin does not fit that definition.  It is also a political statement for me.  I am not a fan of the current fiat system.  
I will have the same or more Bitcoins in 5 years...
Worth 1 cent
Or 
Either way I will not sell.  My fiat tax dollars are used by my government to fire missiles and drones that kill women and children around the world.  Owning Bitcoin is my quiet counter-revolution.
@_date: 2014-09-15 15:02:01
Ok good simple question.  I need to clarify a bit.
You can, but it will be much more difficult in a Bitcoin world.
Let's just assume Bitcoin becomes the world currency.  No other currency is being used.  It is 2040 and almost all the bitcoins have been mined.  Bitcoin continues to increase in value because of limited supply.
Let's just say for this example Bitcoin value increases 5% a year.  Let's also assume because there is no central bank and no excess printing that most bitcoins are actively used for productive businesses.  Because of this trading firms would not be as big a part of the ecosystem if the Bitcoin World Economy.  If everyone who holds Bitcoin is receiving 5% increase in value by holding them in their personal wallet for no fee, the trading firm is going to pay big interest rate to convince people to part with their guarantee Bitcoin gains.
The only reason we have all these prolific trading firms is the banks are given monopoly (fiat) money by the central banks and they need to take risk because they got it for free at no interest.  
My example is not a great one, but it is accurate.  Remove fiat currencies and leverage will greatly reduce.  
Thank you for your question.  My statement was a bit misleading if not false.......

You are missing three additional steps in the process.
8.  (government/regulator) Never publicly says they are against bitcoin.
9. While smiling in support of bitcoin they(government/regulator) write legislation that cripples any company attempting to build a bitcoin ecosystem.  When bitcoiners criticize the cruel legislation the government/regualtors always say they(government/regulator) are friendly with bitcoiners and are working together.
10. They(government/regulator) go out for drinks with major banks to discuss the jobs they(government/regulator employee) will get when exit public life.  Similar to rotation that happens at military brass and weapons companies
