I like Crypto Bobby YT Channel, he seems genuinely interested in educating his followers

Only works if the German holds the coin for a year, not very practical I’m afraid

In Germany too :)

But also it increases the value of the remaining coins. And we have fractions of bitcoin to trade, so it’s not too bad for the community

Unless you chose very low fees you probably lost money there

That site is awesome, thanks!

Kind off, I wouldn’t be sad if the mining was profitable even right now. If the coin value is high enough and the difficulty is low enough it should work. I guess every coin that can be mined with ASICs is out of scope here, and also the must popular ones because the difficulty is too high already. I‘m not sure how IOTA, NEO, Dash and such perform and how the mining works there. So I thought someone more experienced can give a hint

Thanks for the input! I understand and agree with 2) and 3), for the wallet topic I guess I have to do some further research on how hardware wallets work. I am not familiar with the seed word backup yet. So hardware wallets kind of have a rescue paper wallet for recovery?

So you can earn BTC there through playing?

That’s the spirit!

EU drivers license should work for GDAX, did the same approach as you. For me it also displayed an error message however my account still got verified.

True, it’s probably just the broad acceptance and lower volatility that account for the trust in fiat. My question 3) regarding what I receive when buying BTC was motivated technically though

Use GDAX, Coinbase trading side, for free buying fees 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:59:11
It’s the same company, Coinbase is for basic use and GDAX is the trading platform
