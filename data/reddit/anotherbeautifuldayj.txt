But i thought that 'load and verify' doesnt include 'private key' (like read only). If not then how should i suppose to send btc to paper wallet except typing manually my walled address to the address field?

Thanks a lot for your help. I logged into blockchain and imported wallet funds using private key (scaned qr code). if i remember correctly I had 5 paper wallets with 2btc in eatch. Once i noticed  BIP38 not working i imported funds back (scanning qr private key through blockchain) to blockchain from 2-3 our of 5 wallets. 
I'll print new wallets in a minute and test them with small amounts in the next few hours ... Really dont want to waste anyones time so this time will try the same steps very carefully and log everything. 
Thanks! :)

Its not bitstamp fault, its gui that made a mistake. Look bellow:

I didn't. Bitstamp has only google authenticator 2FA. the email was compromised because I had set up the confirmation of withdrawal by email.

You might be right but I think 8bln for such invention is nothing and sooner or latter it will attract 100x that amount. I think that someone is trying to keep price down on purpose because there are no other real ways of detracting bitcoin and keeping masses away from this risky evil thing. We'll see who is right in 5-10 years :) 
@_date: 2014-08-18 21:26:54
So they will dump millions for 100$ each or lower and then what? Buyers will buy out whole network for nearly nothing. Let them dump!

Ok, o think I figured out - BIP didnt worked because I didnt clicked 'generate' in  ... Thats why it printed 3 default paper wallets in the page without bip protection. Sorry for realizing it just now, huh. I sent test amount to blockchain again and will try to work with it in the evening. 
Thanks for all the wish to help, really grateful for all the support.

Hey, thanks a lot for your time on this and brief explanation! :) 
I also thought like this but now realised that maybe something went wrong because I didnt wait for all confirmations and messed around. Will try to do as you say in the evening, be patient this time and log every step in case error occurs. Thanks again for help! :)

thanks mate, i know this but still ... it might sound very stupid but i'm afraid to forget the password :)) but yes, you're right ... Paper with BIP38 is probably best option. Cheers :)

Ok, but it wont increase like 50%, probably 10-30%, no? So even though its 80-100 days to break even its INSANELY profitable:)

Because i was able to sent all funds to another wallet without entering key or BIP38 pass. 
Mybe I'm wrong at some stage but this is what happened: 
1) i created paper wallets with BIP38 pass
2) sent 0.02btc test amount to blockchain
3) sent this test amount to paper wallet
4) added this wallet to my android as read-only and checked balance. It was there. I tried to send btc from paper walled back to blockchain and it worked. Thats great. 
5) sent 10btc to blockchain and started sending them to separate paper wallets
6) when i was doing the last one, i remembered that blockchain didnt asked for BIP38 pass for this test 0.02btc. Thats strage but i thought that its my mistake - maybe i forgot to tick the box when was creating paper wallets and bip38 wasnt applied. 
7) decided to test bip38 with another 2btc wallet so i attempted to import it back to blockchain - it went ok and didnt asked for code. Strange. 
8) then i realized that it doesnt make sense to have paper wallets without bip38 and i'll have to send money back to blockchain. 
9) I sucessfully imported funds from probably 2-3 our of 5 paper wallets. rest few i didnt gave private key. I'm pretty sure about it
10) then noticed that balance shows like at the beggining (13btc with something. I added 3btc latter)
11) i though thats strange and attempted to send it to another wallet- it all went through successfully. 
Its probably my mistake somewhere or i dont understand something or mixed up something but it was just strange that i was able to send all btc from all wallets though i'm pretty sure that at least 1-2 wallets private keys werent given to blockchain. Or i mixed it up. But very unlikelly, huh :/

Keep on trying localbitcoins - here are some cool people around, def you find a smiling trader.

Facebook :you send 1$, you get 1$. Bitcoin: you send 1$, you get??? $....  Me in Uganda now,  people don't have Internet but have Facebook.  Same goes to many Africa countries...  Bitcoin would be white people tool,  stop dreaming! Volatility can kill bitcoin,  nobody will want to involve into currency which can make their capital shrink.  Facebook guarantees stability and that's what people wants,  sorry for sad realism.

Then problem is that bad guys will think that node owner owns btc as well.  They might scan it ports,  do usual things to try to get inside...  It's like a honeypot.. With bitcoins inside :)
