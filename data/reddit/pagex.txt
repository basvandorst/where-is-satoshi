I'm seeing it happen on a retail level. I walked into Best Buy last month, went to check out, the guy  says debit card? I say yeah, and he jokingly says... "As long as you're not paying with cash" ... I haven't been able to quit thinking about why a best buy employee would even say that.

This is just my two bits. But on Coinbase you can generate and print as many paper wallets as you want.  When you do this, the wallets balance is zero. Then I move coins off Coinbase to these prints (that I've also laminated), then if I want to carry some on the phone, ios in my case, I just open mycelium and sweep however much I want into it. And, if I choose to, I leave a balance on the paper wallet. 
Like I said, this is just my two bits. But this process has worked well for me. And at one point I had 25+ coins on Coinbase. So I feel your pain. But you can't beat the relief of a paper wallet. 
EDIT: I'm sorry, I misread your post as you asking how to do this.

It's on the last two pages of the book Digital Gold. Gates concedes to some degree after Wences says this... "To me it feels like you are trying to get the whole world connected with something like Compuserve when everyone already has access to TCP/IP" ... That's when gates says that his foundation might be making a mistake. - the last two pages made me grin for hours.

Just use the generate paper wallet on Coinbase for a quick way to take the flying leap. Generate a few, and print multiple copies of each. Then proceed with sending coins. It's a quick process and works well.

I'd recommend the book Digital Gold by Nathaniel Popper, for a good history lesson on Bitcoin. It's a good read.

Unfortunately the identity raping part is true. I was on 3rd street at the Spitfire bar in Seattle a few days ago, where a coinme ATM is located. I walked over to try it out. It took a picture of my face, and then asked me to hold up my drivers license next to my face for yet another picture, then it asked for my phone number. I gave up after that, then maybe 8 hours later I get a text saying the picture it took wasn't good enough after I was a hundred miles away.
It pains me to have to say, that the whole process was laughable.

I posted this quick how-to on another thread a while back... 
Go to bitaddress.org
Single wallet &gt; 
generate &gt; 
print a few copies &gt;
laminate &gt; (optional)
Then Send a small test amount to the printed address to get comfortable with it. Then get further familiar with it by doing it in reverse... Download a wallet onto phone like mycelium or bread wallet 
Then sweep the keys you printed into one of the phone wallets... wait for confirmation , then send back to paper wallet. 
Repeat process, and you'll have a good understanding of the process

So was the DNS system, all businesses suddenly had to have a domain name right around 96, and all the millions of businesses that got one did the advertising for the Internet as a whole, by promoting their own dot com. The masses followed. 
And IMO Bitcoin is the second coming of all that mania. Thus, The masses will follow as soon as they can't go to a grocery store, or see a TV ad without also seeing a B logo and / or cleverly designed QR codes .... It's called "retention advertising", the more someone sees something, eventually they jump in.

Unknown about every country. I'm just speculating how a gov could tax, if they were highly motivated to do so.
@_date: 2015-09-28 16:25:19
I could see one way for the government getting involved to collect taxes... In many years to come, The gov mandates / takes over all mining, and forces a 15% transaction tax. Which at that point, makes it similar to some proposed plans of abolishing income tax, and only taxing 15% at the retail / transaction level. 
I'm in no way saying this should happen, just speculating on one possible outcome. You never know with a governments bureaucracy.

It really is a tough one to explain to people who don't understand how fiat works in the first place. That said, if you're running into problems explaining Bitcoin, Zeitgeist addendum is actually a good doc for someone to watch if you are trying to explain fiat, and thus the importance of Bitcoin.

Yes, Indeed. I have some stored on Coinbase as a lot of people do, some in mycelium, and some on a paper wallet or two, containing negligible amounts like 0.011 and so on. I have a trezor that I've just started playing with. 
But I have a question about the trezor. It looks like a great solution to long term coin storage. But my only holdup is that I can't get past the idea that it feels somewhat centralized, meaning I have to access mytrezor.com to send / receive, etc ... Unless I'm missing something. But It just seems like it should have a localized built-in webpage that loads from the trezor itself without having to rely on the mytrezor.com domain being online 100% of the time. 
If anyone can shed some light on this concern I'd love to hear it. I really hope I'm just missing something.

In my experience people fear and mock what they do not understand. And Bitcoin requires you to radically alter everything you've ever learned about money. Sadly, if it doesn't have a dead president on it, it's not real money for most people. It takes education. All of us here have educated ourselves and had the ah ha moment. They'll get there.
