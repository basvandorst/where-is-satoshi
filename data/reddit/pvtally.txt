If regulatory capture wasn't an inevitability, sure.

Double-action only, sure, or DA/SA

Not OP, but doubt the reason he was asking if you had a business plan was because he's your friendly neighborhood credit union loan officer... but yes, an actual written plan will be necessary if you care to have a small chance of success. Because your neighborhood loan officer will require one to determine your likelihood of repayment (profitability).

And that's how you're currently treating the american currency.

Pretty sure Murray got that, as his was also in jest.

Maybe I'm confused, I used the words "xenophobic" and "nationalistic" referring to statements by Trump that others have called racist.

Apparently you erroneously believe  "human" to be a word open to emotional interpretation rather than biology. Give science a shot sometime and see how often "hate" and other horseshit political notions come up. Your understanding of the world is a deliberate misdirection to keep you hating the "right" people when hating at all isn't even in your or anyone's best interest.

It's unfortunately true that feeling hatred is a common thing, but that doesn't mean the same as healthy or "normal." Nor is it normal or healthy to *express* hatred - let alone to counsel others to do so! "Terrorists" is a contemporary loaded word which serves to make it easier to hate and kill human beings. It is not normal or healthy to hate and wish the death of groups of human beings.

Understandable sentiments if you're a naïve adolescent, vile boolean ignorance if educated. "Terrorists are evil, nukes are the answer"; pathetic.

Conservative with clear grasp on the definition of racism uses it to hedge all bigoted Trump statements into "not technically racist" category -- ignoring the obviously inflammatory nature of xenophobic and nationalistic phrases and policies about individuals in favor of arguing definitions.

Sorry, you have years before we can have a legitimate conversation; please educate yourself and work on having, expressing, and engendering compassion and humility, and avoid expressing your hate and ignorance so we can hear ourselves make real decisions not based on fear.
