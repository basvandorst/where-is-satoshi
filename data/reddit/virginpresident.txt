I had downloaded electrum well after starting. I started off with copay and coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:59:49


isn't the fear for coinbase use is that its technically US-centric, and if gdax is owned still, wouldnt a fear of US policies seizing coins still exist? or am i wrong?

I literally invested some throwaway cash a few days ago when it was at 7400. Now I'm tempted to spend more. Should I wait?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:58:28
seriously. where else can i buy?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:05:38
Curious if you paid for the ledger with BTC or other? Just thinking would it make sense to pay for these BTC but not be able to use them to support them lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:36
hope not meaning you want it to be more?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:40:09
thank you

Mnemonic phrase = seed ..... gotcha. Private key = address to send/receive coins, right?
1. thank you!
2. I see recommendations for Electrum but the Android app ratings are less than the app I just transferred my coins to, 
Any reason why I should go with Electrum? 
Can I move from current wallet to Electrum (another wallet) without processing fees? Or should I stick with my current wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:43:39
Okay so the phrase is created at the wallet level then. Excellent! 
Side question. Could I create a new phrase? Would that mean making a new wallet and choosing to NOT recover my coins, which gives a new seed branch, right?
Second question. Although I made the phrase through copay, can I delete the copay app and still use the seed? The app has no coins. I have them elsewhere
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:45:52
ahh so you can buy back in
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:39:52
pretty sure people would recommend buying thru gdax then with cheaper fees and a more accurate price, but i'm new around here. gdax is lagging too though lol

Armory on my desktop is an example right of a hardware wallet? New to this . I haven't taken my investments off coinbase yet.
That includes ETH and LTC. Would I be able to out them in the same wallet or just BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:45:16
duly noted. until this happens which is worrisome lol

What's "a lot of money"? And and what's a "small amount" for testing? Because I can say $100 is a lot and transfer out right?
And I can test with a $1 or is that too large still?
I'm on Coinbase (new user), and I'm really looking into a hard wallet to companion my software apps (mobile and PC). Hearing a lot of hype about taking my coins off of Coinbase because they're not my coins until they're my coins (right?).
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:13:03
thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:42:32
okay thank you so much. i'll definitely look into the WinOS application for Electrum when I get home.
Side note: is the bubble pop we've been expecting? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:39:59
thank you

Hey, newbie here.  I'm still in the heat of research, but wanted your input on Ledge Nano S vs. Trezor?  How did you choose between both?
I'm invested in BTC, LTC, ETH. A buddy of mine also invested in a handful (he's more experienced) and said he uses different wallets for each of his CC's.  Do you agree with that? Should I buy multiple Ledger wallets for each CC's?

@_date: 2017-11-29 18:49:41
thank you so much. 
Summary re-cap for my understanding.
1. don't lose my current phrase. ever. otherwise i lose existing BTC (only? or LTC and ETH investments too???)
2. creating a new phrase means creating a new wallet strating from scratch (e.g. no coins). Works if I wanted to split up my coins into multiple wallets. Some apps allow multiple wallets within the app, right? Or would I HAVE to use a completely different app/email account to create a new phrase?
3. deleting the app doesn't delete coins. if i have my phrase, i can recover my original seed which has my existing coins
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:13:21
what if he wanted to buy
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:48:27
1. how do you its NASDAQ approved now?
2. how are you tracking prices? i'm using gdax but wondering if another 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:22:17
4 ledgers? interesting.  I'm still in need of researching how to transfer my coins out of coinbase, but in that research I'll also look at how to copy if I choose to get 2 wallets. thanks for the input!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:31
haven't traded with them yet, but i did read in another thread it's lower. both owned by the same parent company, but gdax is closer to the action (paraphrasing) so think of it like a wholesaler vs local store. but idk fees yet tbh. sorry

So, not only more stable for myself, but for other people I presume?

Quick question: why does windows 8 save the Electrum in my roaming appdata folder? Can it not be transferred to either Program File folders?
edit: well I guess the info is saved there, and the Application is saved in my downloads folder, so can I just drag it to my Program Folder?
@_date: 2013-04-24 02:37:49
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-04-24 02:40:09
just to be sure
this is the site

Ah, and how often does the blockchain get updated (and at what rate)?
Is it best to open the software up daily/weekly/monthly, or just leave it open?
