Was actively trading with it. Just closed a margin position this morning, and thought about withdrawing, but sadly didn't.
Have most of my bitcoins on a trezor, but this was obviously a big hit.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:18:24
Yup, I'm in the same boat :/
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:50:02
Sounds like you don't take responsibility for the funds lost? Or else you would surely not start letting people withdraw funds from an insolvent company?
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:45:02
How can you relaunch if you are short 120k bitcoins? 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:35:11
Do you feel at this moment that there is any hope for bitfinex to survive this? And any hope for users with btc balance on bitfinex to recover any funds?
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:10:57
I had 17 BTC on Bitfinex, but I would still hate to see this reversed as that would destroy the immutability of bitcoin imo.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:37:45
That you are even evaluating that is just horrible. Customer funds have been lost, authorized by YOUR key in a broken multi sig setup. You have basically stolen the funds from the users yourself. How do you rationalize putting this loss on the individual users and keep running?
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:39:47
Will users whose wallets that were unaffected get all their funds while owners of hacked wallets get nothing back? Or will you consider socialized losses? 
Edit: thanks for your efforts to communicate while in an obviously stressful and chaotic situation
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:40:57
You speak of the relaunch as if it is a given. Does this mean that you are confident that you are still solvent? Is an insolvent business allowed to go live again?
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:43:38
The information that has surfaced so far points to around 120k BTC

Yes, this entire Wright saga stinks badly, and I have a feeling it is being played out by people trying to hurt bitcoin.

That's a big loss, hope you have a coin or two stored somewhere else!
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:17:01
Had 17 BTC on there, checked my deposit address and it was emptied earlier today. Sucks.

It was Gavin's hostile tone and personal attacks I had issues with, not that he replied on a public forum.
I am open for your interpretation of how bitcoin consensus works. What I find disturbing is how he painted this very mechanism as something we have to guard against, and used it to give legitimacy to having the very low activation treshold of 75%.  Also, as far as I understand you only have to very briefly hold this percentage for it to activate, while having to hold 5+ percent permanently to avoid activation even if it was 95%. It seems pretty obvious to me that he is playing a game of manipulation, and I think that needs to be called out.

You make no sense. It is a problem that Coinbase doesn't use Segwit. They are a huge player in the space, and are not going away anytime soon. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:27:14
Maybe 3% of Coinbase's userbase even knows what Segwit is. They are embedded in bitcoin, probably for good. And how the hell does signing a Change.org petition resemble crying like a baby. I don't think you realize how stupid your arguments are. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:40:18
You are wrong. Coinbase are claiming that Segwit is not wanted by their customers, and using this as an excuse not to implement it.

Facts. Clearly there are no disagreements in the world as to what constitutes these mental artifacts. In your definition of the term speculation, almost everything can be considered speculation. Everything where the outcome is not 100% absolutely certain. Does this mean that you consider the possibility to be 0% that the usd will not hyperinflate? Or is all saving speculation? You seem to lack the ability of thinking for yourself, and getting a perspective on things. Now you have to excuse me, I have to go speculate that I will not piss my pants.

I don't have the answer, but I think we need to try to think outside our current paradigm with banks and accounting systems. The first adopters of bitcoin settlements may not reap the biggest rewards, but the total lack of friction that direct payment offers would have to have some benefits?

I am not convinced Bitcoin's adaption process will follow these phases. Technology that is as disruptive and groundbreaking as this will not adhere to previous models or phases.

@_date: 2014-12-10 10:53:00
I can only answer for myself, and that is the key here I think. To start with your own reasons for believing in Bitcoin. I don't try to get people excited about Bitcoin primarily for the applications it has today, but for what it could be tomorrow, and how that can change the world we live in. I see no bigger selling point for an idea, than its ability to change the world.

Seems like Mauldin has really understood Bitcoin, entire article is thorough and well written.
"Since that time Worth Wray and I and our entire team at Mauldin Economics have done a great deal of research on Bitcoin.  We will soon release a video documentary that is one of the best productions I’ve ever been involved with and that does a good job of explaining both the controversy around Bitcoin and its considerable promise. We talked with skeptics, enthusiasts, and people willing to put up tens of millions of dollars betting on the future of Bitcoin."
"While I think that Bitcoin as currently configured has limitations, the technology of the blockchain is one of the most potentially revolutionary developments of the last century. I think we evolve to Bitcoin 2.0 or 3.0, using the same blockchain technology, but with a way to make the new currency a truly stable medium of information that can be easily exchanged for goods and services."
"The blockchain will form the basis for the perfect medium of information exchange (at least as perfect as we humans can create), which in turn will be the basis for whatever electronic medium of financial exchange we evolve in the future. The market (that would be you and me) will move to whatever new medium serves our purposes best."

This is gonna end really bad.. Never seen a more obvious scam than what GAW is doing with their 'hashlets', and now this coin.. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:48:32
Josh Garza of GAW miners is speaking... That just rips apart the credibility of the entire conference imo.

Such a narrow and boring perspective. Price is a very poor indicator of where this movement is at, as it is way too easy to manipulate.
@_date: 2014-11-26 11:39:27
I mean that the terms 'cloud mining' and 'reputable' are mutually exclusive.
@_date: 2014-12-10 11:04:28
It seems like you have a more narrow view than me of what adoption is. At this point I consider adoption to be one or more of the following:
- Owning some amount of bitcoin
- Occasionaly paying for something with bitcoin
- In any way contributing to the ecosystem
And I would disagree with bitcoin having no benefit for normal people. As a savings instrument, it is likely to outperform fiat quite drastically in the coming years.

Deva Annamalai, SVP, Marketing Technology and Data Insights
Zions Bancorporation: “The significant change I foresee for 2015 is the disruptive innovation of the BlockChain technology going mainstream. This decentralized technology truly has the power to change the way we do international payments, micropayment, money movement, smart contracts and real world asset tracking. The invention of Bitcoin is a watershed moment in payments and the Fintech industry.”
Aite Group senior analyst, Ron Shevlin believes consumers (and retail banking) will continue to treat Bitcoin as a novelty, but he believes laying the groundwork to use Bitcoin to address the inefficiencies, risks, and compliance issues for B2B payments and cross-border payments will emerge as a significant development in 2015.

It's a tough sell indeed, that doesn't mean we shouldn't try, does it? And if we really believe we have seen and understood something others haven't, should we really care if they consider us crazy? 
@_date: 2014-12-10 11:18:57
Did you think of that yourself? Or parrot it from somewhere? In my opinion it is more speculation to hold usd, being wildly printed by a greedy and ignorant elite to prop up a failing financial system, than holding an asset that can not be printed and is being worked on by highly skilled, motivated and intelligent people.

Incredible that this gets down voted. Would have expected it elsewhere, but I guess it just shows what kind of stranglehold mainstream media has on people.

Problem with this video in my eyes is that it is not very funny at all. It is just rehashing ignorant mainstream views of the community, which could have been fun if you had gone a bit more all in with it, but as it stands it was just boring to me.

Thing is, an attack can be motivated by other things than monetary gain. If a 51% attack was to happen, I think it would be perpetrated by some power structure wanting exactly what you say would deter an attack, for Bitcoin to lose its credibility and function as a store of value. This result is actually an incentive to a lot of powerful people.

The changes are minor details, worded by the SEC itself, and also a result of the meeting of feb 14 detailed in another post. Why would they propose these (minor) changes, if not to approve when we are two weeks from the deadline?

It says "The Exchange believes....." Not the Trust. 
Edit: Which is basically the same. So the commencement thing is not a thing at all. The amendment itself is though, and I stand by my conclusion that this is pretty damn bullish regarding approval.

Why do you call them magical? They are well documented and actively being pushed towards production. Rootstock alone will provide 300 tps capability with their current implementation plan. When L2 solutions like LN and Rootstock come online (Realistically late 2016 or early 2017) the pressure on the blocksize will be greatly relieved. It will not become just a settlement layer overnight, but the majority of transactions will not need to happen on the main chain anyomore.

I don't consider it mob rule to demand that a man running an obvious scam is not allowed to stand on the stage of the biggest Bitcoin conference out there. 
It seems that you have not bothered to look into this yourself, all the "screaming", "shitty attitudes" and "namecalling" is very much warranted. Spend 10 minutes on hashtalk if you want to see for yourself.

The organizers, and the other speakers. I'm surprised that none of them has raised their voice on this, as it completely discredits them to be on the same stage as Garza.  If someone could page Vitalik Buterin, Jeff Garzik, Peter Todd, Nick Sullican, and any other speaker that has a reddit account, that would be awesome. I don't have their usernames.

@_date: 2015-01-02 18:26:09
The solution with the Q&amp;A was good regarding the speaking. You are not adressing the fact that Paybase is a premiere sponsor. With all the evidence of wrongdoings by Garza/GAW/Paybase, accepting money from them, and promoting them as a main sponsor is completely discrediting the conference.

Accepting them in the first place is one thing. Now that it has been brought to his attention in a very clear way that Paybase and Garza is an obvious scam, still in the process of inflicting economic damage to people, there is no other option than to remove their sponsorship. Any other course of action will discredit the conference, the other speakers, and be morally detestable.
I think you should have done a minimum of research into Garza/GAW/Paybase before diving in with this post.

Having the balls to go through the evidence themselves, and say it how it is deserves some credit. With Bitcoin Miami, Bruce Fenton and Eric Vorhees just making weak statements about sunlight and Q&amp;A's, Shapeshift just manned up and made a difference. Everyone can make a mistake, as they did when they started shapeshifting Paycoin. They have now redeemed themselves in my eyes.

Let's make one thing perfectly clear here: You are not putting the community first by letting Josh Garza speak his drivel on the main stage. The community wants him removed, with the conference distancing themselves publicly from him and his "company". Letting him speak will come back to haunt both Bitcoin and the conference. Face the problem head on.

Hi Gavin! Eleven is an awesome number, but would you agree that 21MB is as good a number as 20MB regarding max blocksize, with the added benefit of feeling very natural and cool for the non-core-developer part of the community?

I stated in my previous comment that accepting them in the first place is one thing. With that i mean excusable, on the grounds that you mention. Even though i would have expected such a big Bitcoin conference to have more control of what is happening in the crypto space. As I would have expected you to have. 
The volume of outrage should indicate to Moe that something is amiss, and prompt him to do the needed research NOW. And after doing said research, come to the only morally viable conclusion: Remove Paybase as a sponsor.

Not one word about the sponsorship? That is what most of the fuss has been about.

Core delivering in a big way these days. Hopefully all the manufactured dissent will be silenced as the improvements keep rolling out. I'm all for developer diversity in the bitcoin world, but it needs to be backed up by more than FUD, lies and 2 lines of code raising the blocksize.
@_date: 2016-03-26 11:17:30
This document precedes the Hong Kong roundtable agreement, where the following was agreed upon:
"Based on the above points, the timeline will likely follow the below dates.
- SegWit is expected to be released in April 2016.
- The code for the hard-fork will therefore be available by July 2016.
- If there is strong community support, the hard-fork activation will likely happen around July 2017."
Granted, not every contributor to Core has officially put their name behind this, but very prominent ones Like Luke Dashjr and Peter Todd has. In any case there was an agreement made with the mining community, where they committed to run only core-compatible consensus systems as long as this roadmap is followed. This is a strong incentive for Core, and nothing so far shows they are deviating from their agreed upon roadmap.
@_date: 2015-05-31 08:53:39
Yes, but why is a proposal that is almost the same size as Gavin's the reason why the devs don't agree with 80% of the community?
@_date: 2016-03-31 18:09:44
You make a good point, I agree that they will twist this to their narrative of blockstream controlling core. I still believe it will become progressively harder for them to twist going forwards.

Do you not understand that having him on stage damages Bitcoin's credibility?
@_date: 2015-01-02 08:58:45
This is made possible by I consider them complicit in the scam until they come out with a strong statement, removing him and Paybase from the conference. 
"Our amazing sponsors"
BTC Miami and Moe Levin considers Paybase "Amazing". Great.
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:37:25
I was getting hyped, until I saw the Paycoin ad at the bottom. Kinda ruined the moment, and the credibility.
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:55:41
Maybe someone needs to call that hotline? What do we know? It could be a sincere person posting out of a wish to help. You are interpreting it as "rubbing it in" because you are emotional over the price drop. It could also be a troll. But we can live with that, can't we?
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:40:58
It's not just speaking. It's accepting them as a "premiere sponsor"..
Quite a difference, wouldn't you agree?
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:48:16
Because his post was downvoted, and I thought his statements would be interesting for a larger audience, since he is a rather prominent voice in the community.
@_date: 2016-01-13 21:21:03
Nothing you say even remotely justifies forking the network. And for what? 2MB instead of 1.75? With LN in the tubes? I feel you are an insincere man, with a hidden agenda.

Edit: This is a ETH/BTC chart
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:38:45
I believe it goes deeper than alt-coin pumping. I think the power behind "BU" want to either kill off bitcoin or gain total control over it via the centralized mining, "emerging consensus" BU. Either way, they need to be fully and publicly technically discredited before they fall, which this should help achieve.
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:14:47
He is obviously compromised somehow, that got pretty clear during the Craig Wright saga, and has only gotten clearer since then.
@_date: 2016-03-26 13:26:09
I don't belong to a camp. 
Claiming that an immediate jump to 8-16 mb blocks has no technical or centralizing implications is just false, and makes you lose credibility.
@_date: 2015-05-22 11:41:08
Great comment! 
The parallel to TTWO and GTA is very good. I wonder if it is a case of investors being out of the loop, or that the "newness" of the investment coupled with the massive weight of the conservative and non-informed opinions out there just wins over their own evaluation?
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:41:12
Any thinking person "might feel that way", and it is a duty for anyone that cares about bitcoin to share that information with people around them.

I applaud the decision of a Q&amp;A, without the speech.
BUT, it is still unacceptable that Paybase is listed as a premiere sponsor.  
Anyone attending or speaking at a conference sponsored by Paybase are discrediting themselves, and the conference is in my opinion implicit in the scam by lending Paybase credibility.

It is very unlikely to ever go through with that fee. There is a way to use RBF (replace by fee) i believe, but never did it myself. Do some research :)
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:06:45
Valid point, but isn't it incredibly naive to think that the big boys of the old world wouldn't have managed to mount a serious attack on bitcoin by now? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:18:56
This would be great, unfortunately I do not believe Wu and Ver have bitcoin's best interests in mind and are hell bent on a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:45:38
It never ends. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:28:08
This alone should be more than enough to convince any rational person that BU must never be trusted with any kind of influence over bitcoin development
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:15:44
Good question. I guess we have to hire people to do some command line work then. A bit more expensive, but no big deal.

That is a gem, thanks!
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:06:42
BU is definitely hurting bitcoin. Calling it bickering is just plain wrong. It is one side being rabidly malicious, and the other side working hard for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:47:45
Very well written, I agree. I also believe, like you, that this test is what makes bitcoin stand a chance against the next attack. It will harden bitcoin, thus making its ideals more valuable. At one point the world will notice the immeasurable value of bitcoin's true immutability and the insanity of trying to centralize or change the fundamental properties of bitcoin.

If they hard fork they are in full charge of their chain. Which sounds like it will be your chain of choice. It's not like any sane developers will join them.

@_date: 2017-03-26 12:49:41
The people behind BU have used "OMG blocks full" (mostly because of blatant spamming) and "OMG censorship" (mostly ungrounded) as ruses to lure people into supporting them. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 08:15:25
Can you please elaborate on that?

So... who paid to have Garzik travel to Beijing?
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:40:34
Yeah, nothing to see here, just a fatal flaw in their code that would grind the entire system to a halt if exploited. Move on.
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:02:17
The fact that their actions make no sense at all, regarding benefiting themselves or bitcoin, is what makes me think they are just pawns in this game. If a bigger entity, like a state actor, wanted to bring down bitcoin, this is pretty much textbook how they would try to do it. And I do believe ethereum, which is much more to the taste of the current power structure with their proven mutability, would definitely take bitcoins place if given the chance.
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:47:02
I am aware that the blockchain is being attacked, which is why I suggested that we standardize a fee that economically prohibits such attacks.
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:45:04
I agree on principle, but in the case of BU I feel we can pretty much agree there is some empirical evidence of their incompetence.
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:46:41
You are the one putting your head in the sand and grasping at straws sir. Says a lot about you and your kind when you try to deflect and trivialize the fact that BU has absolutely no peer review, and contains bugs like this that would actually fuck up the entire bitcoin network if put into production. How can you trust code like that? You must either be paid for your position or stunningly ignorant.
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:28:33

@_date: 2017-03-14 21:41:05
It's a shame you percieve Core as combative, I can only guess it comes from spending time on rbtc. I do find it strange that you are not able to "discern between the camps" after five years in the space. If things are as you say, I apologize, and sincerely hope you soon see Ver and his cronies for what they are.
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:52:47
I guess this is the level of ignorance one must expect from people dumb enough to support BU.

@_date: 2017-03-14 20:16:46
You are not fooling anyone with your undecided-ness. Calling Core combative is just more meaningless lies from your camp.

Are you actually claiming Coinbase's support for segwit is because of threats from Core and their supporters?? Just wow....
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:53:04
Completely agree there is more at play. He would still earn more from a non divided bitcoin, with no threat of hard fork. So I don't believe economic gain from mining is his motivation. All his statements and actions seem pretty much the opposite of bitcoin's best interest. He feels like a front for something else, and I do believe the whole BU operation is indeed an attempt to subvert bitcoin. Getting more obvious by the day.

Just by saying you don't take a stance between Core/BU and saying there is plenty of blame to go around, you are at best showing some profound lack of ability to make sense of things, and take away from your own credibility. You are implying there is any kind of merit or good intentions whatsoever from the BU movement, which is a fallacy.

The only "arguments" they have are to paint blockstream and Core as a cauldron of censorship and corporate interests. Also vague FUD that segwit is "dangerous code". At some point their lack of product (and good intentions) will be apparant.
@_date: 2016-12-29 23:58:46
CKPool started the other day, but they only had 0.3% as far as i understood. Could be that BTCC or Bitfury has added some hashpower. But also could be just variance of course. We will know in the coming days. 
@_date: 2016-12-12 20:22:29
Depends on how you define actual proof, but hard to argue how it could have been done without someone from Gox pulling the strings. And Karpeles pretty much ran that ship by himself. You can read the Willy report and come to your own conclusions.

Legit = free as in freedom. Ok. Strange definiton. But how does that apply to BTC-e?

They are of course fully aware of what is going on. ViaBTC have been rather active in trying to make them join the BU cause. We can only hope they get the same amount of information from the Core side.

This is just giving too much credence to the ongoing social attack against bitcoin. The anti segwit crowd has no valid case, no product and no arguments. They will fall apart.

Activation is based on hashrate, miners signaling support in the blocks they find. You are talking about nodes, so doesn't matter if those guys stay on the couch, activation-wise.

It is already void of value. Worth like 1-2 cents. Higher denomination bills are being introduced.

Kinda misleading. This is because they are introducing higher denomination bills due to hyperinflation. 20 000 bolivar bill will be the new largest bill from dec 15th.

The bubble was a manipulation, courtesy of Mark Karpeles and his "Willy-bot". The price would never have touched anything even close to those heights, had it not been for foul play on mt.gox's part. Thus the correction back down when gox fell apart.

Maybe you should do some research into how much bitfinex makes every day on fees? There is absolutely no way they are in need of creative accounting. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:33:43
Seems to me that the current attack shows that 0-conf transactions are only viable if their fee is at a certain level. I don't think we can pretend that bitcoin will ever be able to guarantee all future transaction spam being included in blocks. At some point a functioning fee market must evolve. And at that point is seems meaningless to let unconfirmed txs fill up the mempool for a long time.
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:23:03
I find this hard to believe. It would make it impossible to send the same amount to the same address two or more times within a short time period.
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:50:56
It is clearly not meaningless if the mempool size starts crashing nodes. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:38:19
Ok. I'm glad you got that off your chest.
@_date: 2015-07-08 13:09:31
It is not an issue right now because the network has yet to be attacked with any kind of weight. If around $5000 can blow up the mempool to 250MB as I have read being the current goal, it seems reasonable to believe that an attack bloating the mempool to several gigabytes would be well within the means of a sincere and hostile attacker.

Yeah, if you run a node and support UASF, go for it. Point is that the only way UASF works is if the ecosystem is behind it. This is a way of showing who is in. A pretty cool way too I think, since we are trying to establish consensus in a decentralized, leaderless system with no board rooms and formal votes.
edit: I mean go for it, as in run the UASF client, not wear Samson apparel. Although that would be extra cool.

Of course is not enough. Why are you even mentioning the amount running uasf right now? Come august overwhelming majority of nodes will be uasf.
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:34:07
The whole point is that by uniting around uasf, nobody is getting forked off. Bitcoin will transact as usual, and if some miners refuse to upgrade to segwit, their blocks will get rejected. Do you really believe anyone will want to sit around and send coins between themselves on a BU chain that not one exchange, wallet or business uses?
@_date: 2016-02-11 16:22:51

Is there any part of this story that doesn't stink? Laptop and USB stick kept by Wright after the meeting due to "fear of leak before announcement". "Brand new laptop" apparantly supplied by Wright. Hard to imagine how Gavin could be convinced enough to release that blog post. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 13:46:19
True. This is just another smokescreen. Back to what Vitalik said, why would you choose anything else than the easiest and most conclusive way to prove something? 
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:31:39
I didn't know that, how?
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:46:40
The specualtion had ended, the world had concluded he was a fraud.

Props to Forbes, first news outlet to balance and question the story.

KnC is clearly the loose cannon, yes.
@_date: 2016-05-10 11:26:53
Average Joe will never understand it. No more than he understands TCP/IP. It will just be there, under the hood, with easy and intuitive user experience.
@_date: 2016-05-02 07:42:28
From the blog post where Wright "proves" who he is: 
"Be assured, just as you have worked, I have not been idle during these many years. Since those early days, after distancing myself from the public persona that was Satoshi, I have poured every measure of myself into research. I have been silent, but I have not been absent. I have been engaged with an exceptional group and look forward to sharing our remarkable work when they are ready."
How convenient if this "research" should prove to support Gavin's big block agenda.
This shit feels like a movie.
@_date: 2016-05-06 13:39:31
Well written and honest. I wholeheartedly support and applaud the efforts of Core. Thanks.

What made you take this decision? 
@_date: 2017-07-02 01:28:20
He has just proved that he is not a sure thing regarding segwit2x support. Fuels the UASF movement and for all we know he might actually mine 148.
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:36:04
How exactly has he definitely proven this??

KnC have been running their business in one of the most expensive countries in the world. Price of electricity, materials and employee cost is not comparable to China. Despite this KNC is saying they will be unprofitable by a small margin AFTER the halving if prices stay the same... I cannot see how the Chinese can avoid getting a return on their investment.
@_date: 2016-05-10 12:37:11
I got one of these from Bitwala. Works like a charm.
@_date: 2016-05-03 06:04:26
I'm not sure I understand what you are saying? Bitcoin already has a working peg to Ethereum, and Rootstock is running on testnet, to be deployed later this year. So smart contracts and interoperability is not a problem for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-02 11:50:27
Good idea. Just remember to go short first.
@_date: 2016-05-23 13:01:14
Pretty bumpy no bump link you got there. 20% increase in two months..

Very cool. But can't see it working before LN or other solution to block size limitations. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:27:47
Gavin explicitly referenced the usb stick as being brought to London by him. Not doing so with the laptop indicates it was supplied by Wright or the people around him.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:00:49
And you wont even bother checking the facts?
@_date: 2016-05-24 18:17:09
Much cred to the guys behind this! Yet another pebble before the big avalanche. Bitcoin is slowly spreading its mycelium into consensus reality.
@_date: 2016-05-06 13:29:50
Since they now also offer withdrawals in btc they might be keeping some of it for payouts.
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:07:22
It might also be enough to get a following from the most fanatic big blockers, to try and win some amount of governance over the development process. Which I believe was his primary agenda. Read the mission statement on his webpage.

Made four transactions today, all of them confirmed first block. Fee was about $1.4

Hi, and welcome to the community! What made you decide to buy some bitcoin now?
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:44:53
Yes, it's his twitter. He is hinting at supporting BIP148

Awesome initiative, good luck!

F2pool, Slush pool, Kano CK pool, GB miners, Watherhole... Total should be more than 20% not signaling segwit2x atm. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:09:31
Too funny!
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:07:19
He just did too much cocaine
@_date: 2017-07-01 21:31:50
I wasn't aware of that. Stopping segwit2x signalling combined with having 148 in his username is rather indicative though
@_date: 2017-05-19 23:33:36
Almost half? How about 21.co is 50% higher. And the 420 estimate is to get in the first block. They estimate about the same as core for timely confirmation.
@_date: 2016-05-30 13:46:50
Paywall because of direct link. Google it to read.
Copy paste of the article:
Chinese investors are pumping up bitcoin again, sending prices up nearly 16% in the past four days just two years after the country that was at the center of a boom and bust in the crypto-currency.
The four-day surge in bitcoin since Friday has added $1.2 billion in market capitalization for all bitcoin in circulation, according to data from blockchain.info. On Monday, prices moved up as high as $525.49 per bitcoin, though that’s still well below the all-time high of around $1,151 in November 2013.
Chinese bitcoin exchanges have been operating despite past efforts by Beijing to curb trading in the currency, which is not subject to any central authority and which can be traded almost instantly across borders.
Huobi and OKCoin, two Chinese exchanges, now collectively account for some 92% of global trading in bitcoin.
The surge in bitcoin buying this weekend could be the latest sign of how Chinese investors are moving money between asset classes quickly in search of high returns. In the past year, equities, bond and commodities markets in China have in turn seen massive surges of new investing, often followed by a collapse in prices as funds have moved elsewhere.
“There’s a lot of hot money in China that has to go somewhere,” says Du Jin, chief marketing officer at Huobi. Huobi has seen a surge of new registrants in the past one month, he said.
Expectations that new supply of the virtual currency will decrease next month could also be behind the latest price surge. The creation of bitcoin via a complicated computing process called “mining” gets more challenging over time, thanks to a mechanism which cuts the number of bitcoin that can be created in half every four years in order to limit supply.
But industry participants also say a number of China-specific factors are also in play.
Stories of scams in peer-to-peer financing have sent Chinese investors familiar with the most innovative forms of investing to bitcoin specifically, says Huobi’s Mr. Du.
The bitcoin network, composed of traders around the globe accessing virtual platforms via their computers and the Internet, also allows a discreet way for a Chinese to move money beyond the country’s tightly-controlled borders.
Bitcoin currently trades at a 7.2% premium when priced in Chinese yuan on mainland bitcoin exchanges compared to counterparts pricing the currency in U.S. dollars, according to industry tracker Bitcoinity.org.
This premium in Chinese prices has persisted throughout the year, suggesting that demand from the country has accounted for much of bitcoin’s recent gains, says Zennon Kapron, founder of financial technology consultancy Kapronasia and author of a book on bitcoin.
Investors are worried about the decreasing value of the yuan and “it seems that China is leading a lot of the movement,” he adds. “People are protecting their investments [by converting yuan into bitcoin].”

Stopped signalling segwit2x, put 148 in his username. Has a solid history of trolling, but this is at the very least a big middle finger to Jihan and Barry
@_date: 2016-05-23 10:54:56
Because BIP68/112/113 enables so much vital innovation and progress in bitcoin. For pools that are fearmongering about limited blocksize to try and veto an upgrade that will relieve this issue, it could only be called radical political action or sabotage.
@_date: 2016-05-23 11:24:58
Kind of insincere to compare bip109 with bip68/112/113. There was hardly any innovation in bip109, and it required a hard fork. Also, there was never anything resembling consensus in the technical community on bip109, which there is on this.
@_date: 2017-07-02 01:22:58
Sure it was..
@_date: 2017-07-02 01:49:40
Just server issues. He just accidentally tweeted "What is Segwit2x?" while his pool had stopped signalling.
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:25:05
Thank you for this!

$150,000, are you saying you came here from 2019?
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:46:55
This comment made no sense. What are you trying to say?
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:36:33
Is TCP/IP just TOO complicated for wide adoption?
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:01:24
The HF in november will never happen, this is only about saving face and avoiding the humiliation of a UASF. You seem to either very out of touch with reality or not honest.
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:53:06
As far as I can tell, they aim to replace core with btc1 as the reference client
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:24:38
Not fear mongering. Just posting reference to the biggest ever bitcoin days destroyed transaction.
Of course it could be anything. But it is definitely interesting.
@_date: 2016-05-02 13:29:14
Doesn't show that metric.
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:14:41
Yeah, big move as I said, actually biggest move ever...
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:59:37
I find it strange that hardware wallets are not mentioned. Clearly the most easy and noob friendly way to store your coins securely.

@_date: 2013-12-22 23:34:40
Thanks :)
But not sure how to accept it.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:57:16
So the only possible actions are
1: Dump 400k on an exchange
2: Dump nothing
Edit: We are talking about 120k coins here btw.
@_date: 2013-12-13 12:18:11
Sounds like Bitcoins will mess up your health.
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:04:45
True. If you care about the grade. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:21:47
How exactly does this thread come off as paranoid? I was just pointing out that yesterday saw a movement of 120k coins from wallets untouched since 2011. This constitutes the biggest ever spike of bitcoin days destroyed. I would think this fact is of interest, and leave it up to everyone to make their own theories of what lies behind it.
PS: One other interesting fact is that all the recent spikes in bitcoin days destroyed have been immediately followed by big downward price corrections. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:33:02
Have a number of contestants start with 1 bitcoin, follow them through a set period trying to increase their holdings.
Follow people trying to cross America or some other journey only using Bitcoins for travel, food and shelter.
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:59:18
Yup. If a fraction of those coins end up on an exchange we are looking at a crash way down.
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:06:05
I agree with you, but short to medium term this could be a huge opportunity to gain or lose.
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:42:00
Why would you say that? Not true.

If this 'does not mean anything', you have a very limited understanding of markets. I don't claim to know what it means, but it clearly means something when one source transfers that amount of coins that have been sitting idle since 2011. You just sound like a bulltard that fights any information that might foster uncertainty about short term price.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:10:38
If you bothered to read the bitcointalk thread, you would find out that in this case the entire transaction volume came from a single source.
Quote: 
"I've done a bit of blockchain exploring.
The block in question where all the bitcoin days were destroyed is this one:
About 120,000 btc were moved. There are many transactions in this block in the 4,500-5,000 btc range. I followed the source addresses back in time. The ones I've looked at all trace their heritage to this monstrous transaction from 27 January 2011:
A single transaction moved 400,000 btc to a single address; this one:
So whoever made the transaction yesterday had 400,000 btc in a single address in 2011. If it isn't Satoshi, who the hell is it?
Note that that 1AY... address had some transactions on 26 November this year; shortly before the ATH on 28 November. A huge whale, perhaps the biggest single holder of btc in existence, is stirring. The question is, why?
EDIT: 400,000 btc in early 2011 was almost 10% of all btc in existence. In a single address. Wow."
