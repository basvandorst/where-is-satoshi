Satoshi is worth more than $500 million. Do you really think he'll be sporting a backpack &amp; old laptop? I don't think so.

Typical gloom &amp; doom article from a Wall Street investing blog.

I would still mention that you Accept Reddcoin Tips on your channel, because Reddcoin is the only Cryptocurrency with a Twitch.tv Tip Bot &amp; lot of people use it for tips.
You don't have to have a Reddcoin wallet. You can withdraw the RDD tips that you receive directly to your RDD deposit address on exchanges like CoinedUp or CryptoRush, by typing a simple command (+Withraw RDDaddress 10000 RDD)

For latest updates, follow: 
This is what's happening:
Blockchain is experiencing a technical issue that has forced us to
temporarily interrupt services. The outage was caused by a bug in some
database handling code. We are working hard to fix the issue and restore
service as soon as possible, but anticipate the outage may last more
than an hour, as it requires restarting database servers with very large
data sets. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this recent
outage has caused you.
Please rest assured that your wallets are safe and this outage does not
affect the security of funds or the completion of executed transactions.
Our preference is not to take Blockchain.info down without announcement,
but the situation that presented itself made it necessary. We will
update you as soon as our services are back online.
We are working hard to improve the resilience and continuity of our
services and are investing in software, hardware and operations to
minimize and then eliminate such outages, even while we increase the
scale of our service which is growing at an exponential rate.
The outage is completely unrelated to a previous problem with
SharedCoin, which was resolved shortly before this unrelated
issue emerged.
Thank you for your patience!

Here it is:

Cryptos are as strong as their communities.
These are currently the largest crypto communities:
**114k subs**
**71k subs**
**21k subs**
**5k subs**
**3k subs**
All the above coins have unique qualities.
Both Dogecoin and Reddcoin are more suitable for micropayments than Bitcoin. Even Satochi Nakamoto seems to agree that Bitcoin is "Not practical for smaller micropayments" :
The only crypto from the above bunch that may come across hurdles toward mass merchant adoption is Doge because lot of businesses fear of loss of credibility.

I prefer tipping in large denomination numbers than in small decimal numbers.
Here you go !
+1000 RDD

MarketCapList is irrelevant as it currently shows Auroracoin more valuable than Dogecoin, and Spaincoin more valuable than Reddcoin &amp; Namecoin.
As I said earlier, Community is the best indicator of CryptoCurrency strength:
**744 ONLY**
**45 ONLY**

I agree, people prefer to receive tips in large denomination numbers rather than small decimal numbers.
**1000 rdd tip** just looks better than **0.0000001 btc tip**

You can actually tip Reddcoin on Twitch.tv :
@_date: 2014-03-11 11:44:53
Tipping Reddcoin on Twitch.tv is actually more meaningful than tipping Bitcoin. Gamers appreciate receiving huge quantities of Reddcoin rather than small denominations of Bitcoin.
As of today, 1 Reddcoin = 0.00000008 Bitcoin
A gamer would appreciate a 1000 RDD tip much more than a 0.00008 BTC tip.
They're always throwing Twitch.tv parties at Reddcoin subreddit:

Brilliant idea.
**Upvotes speak louder than comments.**
@_date: 2014-04-05 23:19:38
Head over to and you'll get tipped to oblivion!
