Yes, it's generally best to store coins in your own wallet, not somebody else's.

By count your money I hope you're of course referring to real BTC and not paper profits...
Remember it's not your money UNTIL it's out of the bank and either IN your hardware wallet or IN your cold storage.

They have an internal wallet you can use. But once you've bought the coins, I'd recommend to withdraw them to your own wallet.

Easiest way to do this would be to support banks that embrace crypto. For example Fidor bank in Europe.

You can buy with a bank transfer from localbitcoins. You don't have to meet in person, so there is no risk of mugging.

1. FOMO buy in as soon as possible. 
2. Store your coins on exchanges, preferably offshore ones.
3. Invest in as many ICO's as possible.
4. Drink frappucino's to cope with the stress.
5. Panic sell if you read any FUD on reddit.

Unconfirmed transactions is pretty high right now at about 25000 (source:  So its probably best to pay a higher than normal fee if you need fast confirmations.

About the same percentage of people as can do a 1 finger pushup.

You could practice moving a small amount of coins off coinbase first, then when you get the hang of it, move the rest. There's no reason you need to move your entire holdings in a single transaction.

The argument that bitcoin is bad because it uses energy is silly. There's nothing wrong with using energy for a useful purpose like powering a decentralized currency. The real problem is that much of the world's energy is being generated using dirty methods like fossil fuels, as opposed to clean methods like solar or wind. The way to solve this problem in my opinion is for the world to switch to clean energy sources.
