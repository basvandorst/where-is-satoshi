There is a fee for payments that are not in USD, pounds or Euros, I think it's 2% or something like that.
But if you pay something in usd, pounds or euros, there's no fee at all.

Uhm, yummy middleman...
Hey, I'm just testing the card in different scenarios, that's all.
@_date: 2014-08-09 17:13:13
It was just a test, man. It was the first thing it came to my mind to test the card, which was the main point. I know the accept bitcoin, I actually mention that on the review.
Where do you want to test it? Amazon? iTunes? At least this money went to charity/developers.

What's the motivation to buy Instagram? WhatsApp? 
In tech, big companies don't buy other companies for direct and short-term profit, they buy them as an investment, for the user-base, etc.
I think if Changetip's user-base continues to grow substantially, it will look like a VERY attractive buy...

Here is a great talk given by Sergio about the behaviour or Satoshi as a miner on the early days of Bitcoin:  (spanish)

Update: I just added the card to may Paypal account and it worked. The paypal transaction appeared instantly on my Xapo account so I was able to confirm it on Paypal in seconds. Awesome.

Mine didn't work until they announced this... weird.

You support Uber but you cannot ride because they don't take your credit cards? 
Now Uber also supports Bitcoin, and with your Xapo card you can ride inside or outside Argentina.
Our special alliance with Uber Argentina gives you important discounts. Add your Xapo card in Uber and use this codes to get discounts.
UBERconBTC - 100 pesos for your first Uber ride
BTCBA - 30 pesos for your next ride if you are an Uber user already
Good trip!

For context: The government here in Argentina has blocked credit card payments to Uber so if you have an Argentinian credit card, you cannot use Uber. 
Before this deal between Uber and Xapo, using the Xapo Card was not possible either.   Now it's working perfectly. I use it all the time :-)
