Big news for bitcoin.

They announced that a while back

Thanks for the answer, so when looking at a TX on blockchain.info for example, how can I see if the inputs were segwit.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:50:14
Some bank's coin. Don't worry about it.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:56:49
I'm still happy with our progress. Block 482703 had 78 segwit transactions in total. Just need a few exchanges to jump on board.

Thanks for taking the time to answer that.

What anxiety? The price keeps going up. (it's probably going to shoot down now that I said this.)
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:21:17
Geez man, thorough review. Keep up the good work.

Do you plan on selling these? Love it.
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:08:23
Can you even call it their code?

That seed from breadwallet is a cool way to store all of your addresses' private keys with just a few words. So if you have that, then yes you own the private keys.

Let her know:

Your seed, or backup phrase(those words it made you write down when you first opened the wallet) is your backup for breadwallet. A seed defines a collection of private keys, which in turn generate addresses.
