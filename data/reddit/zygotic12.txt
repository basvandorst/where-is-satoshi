Well I've always thought of it as a Premium Bond backed by crypto instead of the Government.
I hope I'm right :) From the article:
Scientific evidence
Two financial economists, Lobe and Hoelzl, have analysed the main driving factors for the immense marketing success of Premium Bonds. One in three Britons invest in Premium Bonds. The thrill of gambling is significantly boosted by enhancing the skewness of the prize distribution. However, using data collected over the past fifty years, they found that the bond bears relatively low risk compared to many other investments.[25]
Aaron Brown discusses Premium Bonds in comparison with equity-linked, commodity-linked and other "added risk" bonds.[26] His conclusion is that it makes little difference, either to a retail investor or from a theoretical finance perspective, whether the added risk comes from a random number generator or from fluctuations in financial markets.

I remember this! You could buy the burger with BTC. Someone on Reddit will tell you how good THE MOST EXPENSIVE BURGER IN THE WORLD (now:) tasted if you get enough reads.
P.S. There wasn't a lot of users on Reddit at the time. All of the action was on Digg would you believe :)
