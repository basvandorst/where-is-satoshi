And the argument that it can be stolen... what a joke! Like if nobody has ever stolen a pound. 
I don’t mind someone disagreeing if based on knowledge and not just pure assumptions. Tulips, bubble, etc are no more than comparisons of past events that has similarities in growth but not in its intrinsic value. 
We are living in a globalized world ruled by a few and this might scare those who fear a true globalization where your money will have the same value as yours no matter what. 
Long live to decentralized cryptos.

Maybe or maybe not. I spect people to continue using it like in Venezuela, China or Russia.
There is a lot of people that uses it everyday to send money to their families, buy food and all kind of basics. A lot of NGOs are using them to finance their projects... but basically what we are seeing everyday in this sub is about speculating with it, buying lambos and shit. 
I’ve never been in Japan and I’m saving in bitcoin to go there. I want to go there without exchanging to fiat and see how it goes :) 
I’m just one person but, hey! I’m using it for something else than speculation.

I really don’t know where to begin. Probably by pointing out the increasing number of business that accept bitcoin and the user base. 
In japan it’s not only that is legal, it’s an official currency with which you can pay anything from taxes to coffee. What do you think it means? 
Yesterday South Corea proposed new regulations on exchanges, why? 
In my opinion cryptos are creating a disruption on a “market” that historically has been ruled by “the others” and now it could be that “we”, the normal people, can start having some power over our finances. That has to be pretty scary for someone that it’s loosing control and power.
All the reactions to that makes me confident that this is here to stay. 
Have an great day!

Honestly I don’t know. If it’s not too much and you can pay easily every month I would hold.

Shit! Have to change it again... just one minute drop!

Nah! The reason of all this is a friend of mine. Called to say he was going to put some. Last time he did was at the ATH. He is the real cause ��

Just go to the pro version: Coinbase pro.
You can import your funds from coinbase and transfer it without any fees

Can’t anyone delete those comments before someone signs up?

I guess you are here by chance? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:38:53
It looks like everyone has an opinion.  
Is everyone that is saying that it’s the end owning bitcoin? 
I got in because I love the idea behind and I can still send and receive value over the internet almost instantly and in a secure way through a decentralized network. To me this is just the beginning.
