And yet the total trading volume at all exchanges recently is only a fraction of the volume that just Mt.Gox carried a few months ago.

Who do you think is buying those $30,000 ASICs? Visa and MasterCard make their cash on transaction fees, and so will miners when the block rewards are gone.

Litecoin is [165% as profitable]( as Bitcoin right now. When I was GPU mining, I would switch back and forth all the time. I'm sure I'm not the only one.

Because with WU, you could send someone bitcoins instantly without having to make a transaction in the blockchain. All they have to do is hold a reserve of bitcoins. Then you buy a money transfer code from them and send it instantly to someone else, just like a Mt.Gox code or a BTC-e code. This would also help stabilize the price, since to do this, businesses need to agree on an exchange rate.
The blockchain simply cannot handle the volume of daily transactions needed to make Bitcoin a viable daily currency. Eventually, only major transactions between large money handlers (banks, Western Union, etc) will occur on the blockchain, while minor transactions occur internally.
On the other hand, if they still wanted to do transactions through the blockchain, they need some serious hashing power. Put a mini-rig in every store, then use the mini-rigs to mine blocks that ONLY include Western Union transactions. That would work, but it would anger a lot of people.

No, a deposit account will not even show up on your financial reports unless you do something stupid like close it with a negative balance. And even in that case, it usually only shows up on a ChexSystems report and not a major credit report.

No, government agencies are treating USD/BTC exchanges as money transmitters, seeing as they are transmitting USD from one user to another as part of the exchange process. Whether or not they recognize BTC as money is a moot point as long as USD is still involved in the process.

I ordered April 1 and asked for a refund last week, which was received promptly.
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:08:00
Or that extra $1 could have went toward any of the following costs associated with handling cash:
* Replenishing a till that was short at the end of the day
* Wages for employees that spend time counting the tills and safe
* Supplies like counterfeit detection pens and other things specific to handling cash
* Armored car companies
* Processing to clean and roll coins, whether in-house or contracted
Only someone who has no idea what it costs to run a real business would think there isn't a significant cost associated with handling cash. Why do you think companies like Walmart are so adamantly pushing pre-paid debit products like [Bluebird]( Over 80 percent of their customers pay in cash, and it costs them a non-trivial amount of resources to handle.
*But JasonMaloney101, Walmart still has to handle the cash when people reload the cards!*
Not necessarily -- one of the most popular features of these products is the ability to receive payroll direct deposit, meaning Walmart never has to handle cash ever again for many of the people that make the switch.

[Press Release](
@_date: 2013-03-25 00:24:10
WiFi password cracking. I would wager that a non-trivial amount of BitForce Jalapenos have been pre-ordered for exactly this purpose. When the network difficulty eventually gets high enough, it will probably be their only useful purpose anyway.
@_date: 2013-10-19 20:20:16
Did you finally receive it?
@_date: 2013-02-11 16:20:29
Yes, and here's why:
I ordered a Jalapeno on February 5, and my order number was already 19,052. The lowest publicly-reported order number is slightly over 1,000. After realizing this, and doing the following math, I cancelled my order.
A block is mined once every 10 minutes, and is rewarded with 25 BTC. So 1,314,000 BTC is generated pear year -- 25 BTC * 52,560 blocks. Let's assume that 20,000 units will be shipped (keep in mind many people purchased more than one unit). Let's also assume that every miner who does not have a BFL ASIC completely gives up on mining. Finally, let's assume that each of those 20,000 BFL ASICs doing all the mining now are mining 24/7 at an identical hashrate.
1,314,000 BTC between 20,000 equally-capable miners is only 65.7 BTC per miner per year. At a modest 24 USD/BTC, that is about 1,500 USD per miner per year, before factoring in power costs. But keep in mind that there are other companies selling ASICs, and that BFL is bound to sell a TON more once they actually start shipping, and that GPU miners aren't just going to give up completely -- they're going to stay in the game at a loss and hope that BTC gets high enough one day for them to make their money back. And that 65.7 BTC assumes every ASIC has an equal footing -- unless the majority of sales are Jalapenos, most people will be looking at a lot less.
Also, a credit card will not help you with purchase protection because you didn't purchase the item directly with the credit card. All the credit card did was fund your PayPal account, and if you do a chargeback, you risk being permanently banned from PayPal (and eBay since they only accept PayPal now).
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:26:57


The protocol is exactly what would allow them to be in the transmission business. If I were Western Union, I would put a BFL Mini-rig into every location (actual release of the product notwithstanding).
EDIT: Downvoted for having faith in BFL, or what?
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:57:36
@_date: 2013-07-01 06:42:06
Because that is not what they do. They facilitate the transfer between the buyers and sellers on the exchange. They are not in the business of buying and selling directly.

Password managers are absolutely the way to go, while the database itself should be highly encrypted and archived. I use [KeePass]( and sync the database across several locations to make sure I don't lose it.
Many people have unique passwords for things they feel are important (banking, etc.) and one password for less-important sites (forums, etc.). I think this is a terrible approach, because anyone compromising one of those accounts can ruin your online reputation for the rest of your life.

Most Bitcoin miners have to be purchased in bitcoin. If you are banking on the value going up, it's more profitable just to hold.

That doesn't worry me. I do actually declare everything on my taxes. 
Last year my refund went down $25 because I added in about $2 of taxable interest from a savings account. But as I have legitimate business income, I have more of an incentive to make sure my taxes are correct.

And yet people are still doing it right now. Most of them spent a lot of money on GPUs and PCs to mine and don't want to cut their losses.
The Verge had an [article]( in November mentioning a man who has spent $60,000 on mining hardware that sits in his backyard. At the time he was pulling in about $3,000/month with a $2,200-2,400/month utility bill, but he has yet to even break even on his hardware.
Unless BTC continues to rise rapidly against USD for a very long time, he is never going to make his money back once the ASICs are all online. And there are plenty more like him. And of those people, many will refuse to swallow their pride and cut their losses. You won't have much luck expecting to convince someone who has yet to break even on a $60,000 investment to drop it and invest more money.

More specifically, he would want the individual states to have the power to regulate it rather than the federal government as a whole, which is exactly the mess we have right now and why it is so difficult to launch a Bitcoin-related money transmitting business (having to be licensed and bonded in every state individually).
