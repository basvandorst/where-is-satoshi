So has anyone gotten anything from this guy, any proof of shipping or the like?
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:22:11
Right but that money is no good to him unless he turns it to real money, and currently bits are worth less than five pounds I believe?
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:59:06
How did the government cause the issue? I thought you guys were against government regulation, you're asking for more regulation.
@_date: 2014-04-13 07:00:44
Well yea all its good for is shitty drugs and child porn and there's no number for the latter.
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:17:57
I thought you libertarians were for free markets and shit
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:17:04
Because bitcoins can be rapidly transferred from an item to money, and with no safeguards and ID process it becomes a haven for money laundering. Without an ID system you can take a bunch of dirty money, buy a couple bitcoins and instantly turn it back to real money that's clean.

Many places in the region have no internet and even if they did they have no way to use fake internet money, you're stealing from these people, you're a legitimately terrible person and should be ashamed of yourself.
@_date: 2014-06-27 02:55:06
No it's more like how your fake money is mainly used for child porn and drugs and shitty hit men and they don't want to be associated.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:40:31
So you paid for it in real money converted from bitcoins? Like, if I sold magic cards and used that money to buy somethings, would you say I bought it with magic cards?
@_date: 2014-06-08 02:45:13
Why are you trying to regulate them?
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:28:17
Well you pretty much don't need to 'clean' money unless it's dirty, right? People launder money that comes from crime which helps to cover their tracks and such. Like, you rob a bank or sell a bunch of blow or whatever and you launder that money to remove a string connecting you to the crime.
@_date: 2014-01-30 15:26:03
Not shown, any actual money.
So yea, super accurate.
@_date: 2014-03-02 15:05:13
He's trying to help by getting people to give him money they objectively have no use for, how is that helping? That's like me saying 'boy the Ukrainians seem pretty tense, give me money and I'll send them PS4s to help calm them down'. That's not a thing they can use right now nor is it what will actually help.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:11:34
Or maybe it's a way to keep it from being used for straight up money laundering for a thing that basically has only use for buying drugs and child porn.
@_date: 2014-01-30 15:25:09
Reddit's really throwing its back into this bubble huh? Can I buy an assault rifle on Reddit for bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-02-11 12:30:40
Wow you paid like three times as much as what most places charge because you couldn't even google 'bitcoin sticker', truly on the cutting edge of finances.
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:45:40
Hahahahahahaha yes, do this, god bless you armchair economists.

@_date: 2014-06-04 12:57:56
If only there was some kind of...centralized...body of power...who had the power to...I don't know, regulate? Because I mean basically you guys want a group to act against their interests for the good of everyone else, and, ya know, the pre-progressive era kinda showed that doesn't happen.
@_date: 2014-01-07 04:10:04
A good sign for a stable, safe, currency is massive fluctuations in worth, I agree.
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:53:22
None of that is true though. "The first motor" isn't a thing, motors, as a broad concept have existed for ages. The airplane wasn't considered impossible. The power loom was considered 'vicious' because it had a bad habit of removing the arms of workers and the like not because it was a bad idea, anesthesia wasn't 'considered sinful' except by religious people with their own cultural bans, in the medical community and all pain killers have existed for centuries.
@_date: 2014-12-04 20:52:38
This sounds like the nerdiest scam ever, you found five bucks and made some rando recite basic company policy so then you gave fake money to a fucking janitor and then you for some reason felt you were entitled to the burden of the 'inferior fiat'.
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:23:38
A felon who has almost all his family and assets in America is 'as far from an overstay risk as you can get' huh?
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:28:44
No, you're not 'punished more' you're subject to the law. A deal is exactly what it sounds like, a deal. They offer you a bonus for your cooperation. That's like saying 'woah this is fucked up, last week apples were on sale and now I'm being punished with regular prices?'
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:07:03
Yea all you people in this sub 100% understand that formula right?
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:00:43
Cool, now good luck getting these people to agree that their drugs need the massive, heavy, regulation that booze gets.
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:50:08


Right, he didn't have the right to bust into their computer room, damage their shit, and take it off there though.


Yes. If I make a copy of your social security number and use it, did I steal from you?


No, good thing he wasn't charged on 'tos violation'.
"On July 11, 2011, Swartz was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of wire fraud, computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer and recklessly damaging a protected computer."


Arguable, but int he current legal system the answer is yes, so that doesn't change that what he did was illegal. That's like saying 'hey man you can't charge me with shooting that dude, I question if murder is actually even a crime to begin with'.
Again, the deck was in his favor, the DA wanted him to take the deal, they told him how simple it would be with them pushing for leniency, they even said THEY WANTED HIM TO KEEP DOING HIS HACKING, just less, ya know, busting into rooms and breaking computers. The DA was literally never not on his side, he had both his lawyer and the DA in his corner.
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:33:29
I'm gonna cut through the jerking off to try to find an actual point in your post.
He was offered a deal, he was on camera breaking into a building and stealing its property, should we just ignore crimes that we feel like? Would you support a prosecutor ignoring, say, that crazy dude who shot the cops if he hadn't shot himself as well, since he was saying he was getting 'justice'?
The DA was on his side, they begged him to take the deal, they wanted it to just be a slap on the wrist (he could have easily gotten the six months combined with time served and house arrested). The deck was stacked, sure, it was stacked IN HIS FAVOR.
He was on camera breaking into a building, he damaged the computers he stole from, the grand jury indited him on multiple fraud cases as well, if he was literally anyone but a middle class white guy with the ability to make himself into a martyr for political causes he would have been having the deck stacked against him. He wasn't, it wasn't.
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:24:35
Right, that's what protects Fedex, in fact Fedex has strict rules about if they DO find you're using them to move drugs and such they take actions. You can make them unwitting movers, but they can't be responsible when they're actively fighting against that.
Silkroad literally existed to move and sell drugs.
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:20:16
Meth and heroin is pretty fucking different than having a beer.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:12:53
I'm sorry where'd you get your fucking law degree from then, princess?
You've yet to actually SAY anything, you just keep jerking this dude off as if that means anything. So now he's fucking Rosa Parks for busting into a computer room, damaging the computers, stealing shit off them, and running out?
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:49:10
So just to be clear, the government pushed this case because he was so outspoken, but again, at that same time, the DA was offering him the literal kindest deal anyone in his position could ever get, to the point where he was told it was likely he'd never even see jail time, just house arrest, because that's how 6 months tends to go for these kinds of crimes?
Wow you're right our government is pretty crazy, on one hand they were trying to bring this poor innocent guy down on trumped up charges (question, you're fine with breaking an entering and property destruction?) and then on the other they were literally begging him to take a deal that meant he'd never see the inside of a cell!
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:27:37
He was offered around 6 months which by literally every standard is the cushest deal you can get, he was on tape breaking and entering, clearly stealing, objectively breaking the law. He chose to protest to make a stand, because he was a middle class white male he was given privileges and kindness that most of the people in the system never even get close to, so fuck y'all for making him a martyred hero.
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:21:47
Agreed, so you're for strict government regulations regarding drugs like there are for alcohol?
@_date: 2015-02-12 02:24:23

So the best way to use Bitcoins remains 'convert them into real money and buy things'.
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:49:36
We created the 'new economy' you're claiming to have back in the 90's when we sold Pogs.

Then he should stop and give the money to his sister like a man.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:51:24
The kind of dude who says


So a very angry virgin.
@_date: 2013-08-01 18:15:51
Because we study economics and understand how much of a scam it is to make limited money that can only be accessed by paying large amounts of money to build a 'mining rig'.
@_date: 2013-08-01 01:40:50
So it's impossible that the problem is the fake money, it's all just people are too dumb?
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:28:03
It's treated like a commodity though.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:55:31
You don't know a lot about money, because literally everything you've done shows you know nothing of money.
@_date: 2013-07-31 23:24:38
What? Chinese paper money was, legitimately, worthless. I can't believe self professed economists and leaders of industry are so fucking stupid they compare their fake money to legitimate fake money.

Did you literally pay the food service in bitcoins or did you give a third party bitcoins and they paid for the food in your national currency?

She was promised around 350k in her half of the money, you're saying at best she'll get 80ishK?
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:21:02
Sounds like a central regulatory body could help.
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:39:34
The whole 'I bought X with bitcoins' is a PR thing trying to make it look like BC is accepted in more and more places, but the fact is most of these people are going through third parties, and that changes things significantly.
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:27:35
You've ruined everyone around you.

SHADY BUSINESS ACCEPTS BITCOINS! DOLLAR CRUMBLES!

How could this be prevented? If I lose my debit card I don't lose my life savings.
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:26:10
So in truth you paid Liferservce.de in bitcoins, and they paid in Euros (I think? .de means German yes?) and you got your food, so the food was paid for in Euros.
If I give my friend a baseball card he wanted, and in return he buys me a beer, I didn't buy a beer using a baseball card.

You've ruined your family and your and your own sister's future, you're a disgusting, loathsome, person because you put your own hairbrained schemes above your sister's future. Put the money in a savings account, if you must invest it without any knowledge use only YOUR half and stick to long term mutual funds and bonds and not shitty internet get rich quick schemes. Create a nest egg for yourself rather than instant money.
Give your sister her due, be a fucking man for once.
