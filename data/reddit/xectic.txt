With Coinbase you can quickly buy BTC/ETH/LTC with creditcard, but you will pay higher fees. With GDAX you will pay market price with a 0% maker fee (google GDAX fees), but to get your money in you need to do a wire transfer and chances are the coin price will be much higher, or lower, when the money is in. Crypto withdrawals are free with GDAX. If you want to buy alt coins I recommend to buy ETH or LTC for a quicker tranfer to Binance, there you can turn it in to BTC or something else using ETH/LTC markets.

Yes, just regular trading fees. Google “Binance fees”

A GDAX withdrawal is free, but you will be paying a lot to move it out of breadwallet again. Breadwallet doesn’t have much features such as replace by fee or Segwit. I would keep it in Coinbase/GDAX with such an amount.

A lot of limit orders are set at round numbers, aka a sell/buy wall. IE, x number of people set a sell order with a 14K limit with a total of 30BTC. All the BTC needs to be bought first before it can move further up.

Spending BTC creates BTC to fiat sell orders as long as shops need fiat to pay loans, taxes and suppliers.

Which exchange? GDAX has insurance.

Someone went long on BTC with an amount of 281,816 USD, and it was sold (liquidated) when the BTC price hit 10.579 USD.
281,816 is the leveraged amount, so this could have been 2818 USD with 100x leverage. Liquidated means the margin used to put in the leveraged trade was not enough to cover the position, because the market went against him.

He got rekt because he went long at a price above 10639. He only loses the margin, not the whole amount. But at 100x you can loose your margin very quciky. Read up on margin trading, very risky especially on a volatile asset like BTC. Did some Bitmex trading myself but only lost money over there.

This does't work that way. If miners stop mining the difficuly drops, and miners will get back on board.

Keep the BTC, store it in a safe place, look back at it after 2 years. I’ve bought Bitcoin at 1K, saw it decline, didn’t pay attention to it for a two years, currently at 10x. You don’t get rich in a day.
