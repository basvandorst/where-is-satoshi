You are gonna have to buy and move it unless your wallet is also an exchange.
Cheapest way I know&gt;
Coinbase&gt;gdax&gt;personal wallet

As soon as I can pay my house off, I’m dumping.  Greed leads to ruin without power.

2 days left bro.  Not saying it’s likely, but it’s bitcoin.

Its designed so you can trade in US dollars.  It’s also a scam. 
  If you want to trade do it with btc.  It’s kinda a win win, even if you price yourself out of a trade.

Had this happen before.  Entered key and got an email hours later.  Week later it works all the time like normal.

  I’m in BTC about 20%.  You can’t really go wrong with more than that.  
I try to pick coins that can beat btc short term.  Sell off and have more btc if necessary.
  BTC has to many flaws for me to be 100% invested.  I completely hope it stays no1 for the foreseeable future, but I’m covered if it isn’t.

You think you’re safe right now?
