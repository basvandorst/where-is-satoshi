And here I am, using segwit, 250sat/byte and it passes in a couple hours...
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:11:09
Same here... and couldnt go back to sleep...
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:33:23
I would not know... I'm not really up to speed as to how to calculate fees for segwit as opposed to legacy. So I use the same sat/byt I would usually use but since transaction has less weight, it costs less in the end.
Anyone can help on that?

Good job! Too bad none of those are near the central train station (895 Rue de la Gauchetière O)

Mine says I talk about bitcoin like if I was in a cult... lol
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:06:27
Yeah I know it's pretty far from a cult. I am so thrilled about the revolution that is happening bit by bit.
I don't even mention Bitcoin alot to her since I know she doesn't really care about it.

I'm still waiting for my damn wire transfer to be completed to buy another 1/4.... dammit! Guess it wont be 1/4 after all... lol
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:34:24
I own 1/4 and I'm trying to get 1/4 more but wired transfers take forever and during that time, price is sky rocketing!!

A couple posters and stickers doesn't mean it's about Bitcoin cash. Roger Ver was there, still doesn't mean the meeting was about Bitcoin cash. What were the different topics again?
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:46:23
You can destroy it anywhere you want :) Just make sure you still have your recovery seed.
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:21:01
Remove all the bullshit Roger Ver is spreading and the relation between the two communities would be way better.
I don't see much people trashing litecoin, bitcoin gold or bitcoin diamond... it's all about the bcash toxicity. I don't see a bright futur for them if they don't detach themselves from Roger Ver and all the lies/misinformation/scam attempts. 
It might not be too late to make amends...

Yeah, I've seen r/btc in action, it's such a mess.
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:10:59
He posted about it on r/btc
"People literally lined up for nearly an hour to take Bitcoin Cash photos with me"
Bitcoin cash photos....
