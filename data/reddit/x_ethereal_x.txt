It's not a gimmick. There's someone buying a lot of SOG cards on the DEX and swapbots. Just the other day a Satoshi sold for 5 BTC on the swapbots:  (see the history at the bottom).  
There's currently an OPEN offer of 1000XCP (almost 5 BTC) on the DEX for one:  If you think it's a gimmick, you could sell to them.

That's a fine example.  if such a thing existed, I would be smart enough not to drive in it. I don't need it to be illegal and I don't need to be protected against it. Its a tool, a dangerous tool, like the DELEGATECALL in ethereum.  If someone else wants to drive it, then have at it.  If I was dumb enough to drive it, it would be my responsibility if something bad happened. Likewise, I wouldn't likely trust my money in a wallet that relied on a single point of failure "library" contract, and certainly not one that could be suicided.  Again, though, I don't want the platform to simply not let anyone ever do a DELEGATECALL because it could be used irresponsibly.

"the code"? This was not ethereum code, just like bitcoin issues aren't with bitcoin code.  This was a negligent mistake by a group of devs, hasn't blockchain.info had similar code related issues with their wallets? Same thing. Third party wallet with a third party code problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:06:47
Huh? The last bailout was the DAO hack, that's not the same contract at all. When the prior parity issue happened, people just lost money, there was no bailout.

I guess to each his own. I believe more in personal responsibility.   I don't need or want my hand held and to be coddled in a safe space... I like C a lot.  I tend to think giving people tools is never a bad thing, it's their responsibility to learn to use the tools responsibly.

Parity is a third party vc funded startup. The code at issue here was their competitor multisig implementation to the ethereum foundation wallets multisig. This was literally a competitive solution to the ethereum devs. Parity has no involvement in solidity development. You don't know what you're talking about.

I'd say he was once revered. He's not so popular now that his company has caused two major losses of funds from negligent errors.  I don't think people perceive him personally as incompetent, he's clearly not, but he doesn't supervise well it seems.  I'm not sure anyone thinks it's malicious per se but they are frustrated and angry all the same.
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:57:16
Yeah but he left ethereum foundation to compete with it. So this wasn't an error of ethereum devs. I mean that's like saying 2x is core code because Garzik was once a contributor to that repo.  It doesn't work like that.

They didn't use a library, they just made a sub-contract.  There are ways of securing contracts so this wouldn't happen, they just didn't do it.  All they did was give them the ability to call contract functions.  The fact that some idiots made a "library" with a self-destruct function has nothing to do with ethereum itself. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:57:18
Yes r/ethereum on Reddit is active. But there aren't really any devs on Reddit. Technical stuff is mostly in the foundation gitter channels. Individual teams have slack or telegram, it's more spread out because development is done more by companies building on the platform

I understand this line of thinking. It's a change from what, until somewhat recently (a year maybe?), seemed to be agreed upon and even often held out by bitcoin maximalists as the defining aspect of bitcoin -- namely the heaviest POW chain. I think the reason mining Ethereum/LTC/XMR/ZEC doesn't matter is that they are so much behind BTC in mining and many not even Sha256 that they could never be the heaviest chain, so referring to them is a bit illogical. 
Bitcoin will always include the current Bitcoin chain, the issue is really only what in the future will be decided to be the one correc Bitcoin  ledger of blocks with the heaviest chain. That will be Bitcoin. 
Your argument about you and me deciding what we buy is, right, but it only sets the incentives and not the definition of Bitcoin. The miners could always change the rules and screw us all -- they don't because of the economic incentives. But saying that if they did, by that mere act, the heaviest chain would not longer be Bitcoin because of some vague definition is wrong.

Bitcoin is not just whatever happens to be in a sub-directory of the github website and it is not controlled by whoever happens to own a certain user account on the github website. And the counter is true: not Bitcoin could well be found within that sub-directory on github if the code compatible with the heaviest POW chain is not found there. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:05:37
I suppose we won't know unless it happens that the core bitcoin repository client no longer has the most POW -- that'll be an interesting day if it ever happens. It's very hard to predict what will happen then with the name "bitcoin" since that's unprecedented.

This makes no sense. How would the world's timeline deal with your past actions and their repercussions. Would no one notice you changed? If they did that would really fuck things up.  Only makes any sense to go back to that time with knowledge of this timeline.

Not true. It's $20k. But the request is for 2013-2015 data. So it's a lot more than 10 btc given most of that time was bear market.

We're saying the same thing. I just meant it's not cumulative between types of transactions. Like it's not a buy of $10k plus a sell of $10k.

Must admit, this is not where I thought that story was going.
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:12:05
Well, it's actually $20k in a single type of transaction (buying, selling, spending/transfer), not cumulative. But I agree it's an arbitrary number and could easily snare small holders. At least for now the request only covers 2013-2015, but that could easily change.

This is not true. BIP148 requires rejecting non-segwit blocks, most miners who are signalling segwit won't do this. As soon as you have a non-segwit signalling block and the BIP148 nodes reject it while ordinary segwit signalling miners build on top of it, you have a chain split with the majority of non-BIP148 segwit signalling miners on the non-BIP148 side. The hashrate on the BIP148 chain will crash, and will immediately fall behind in POW. The chance of a re-org will diminish quickly as it falls more and more behind. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:02:26
you can't trade the coins if the difficulty is so high you never get a block. If the hash power splits, you're looking at 20 min (avg) blocks until a difficulty adjustment, which would also take twice as long. It's unlikely the UASF fork would have half the hashrate at the outset.   The reason this worked on ETH with ETC is that ETH has dynamic difficulty adjustment. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:12:56
If you're curious this is the original description of how it works. Apparently Vitlaik came up with it. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:21:54
It's paradoxical. If there's enough hash power asymmetry to make a transaction to sell the coins workable and enough for the coins to be valuable (&gt;50%), then chances are there is an exponentially growing unlikeliness that there will be variance to cause a re-org making the other chain dominant. That asymmetry will persist unless there's a difficulty adjusting HF since it's likely the losing side would never mine enough blocks to ever see a difficulty adjustment. That HF of the difficulty (or simply letting the other chain persist) would mean there would never be a re-org of "Bitcoin" and an altcoin would be created.

I think you can strike through the last sentence too. As far as I know, wallets use .eth addresses just fine. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 18:44:34
The upper/lower case encodes a checksum usable for wallets to make sure the address is correct. The address itself is hex, so case insensitive at the protocol level.
