Imagine living in a country where the popular vote has never elected a president, then having to listen to libtards complain about it like something all of a sudden changed.

No but the Trump admin obviously colluded to steal your intelligence.

I used Coinbase pro for awhile but recently opened a Gemini account. On Gemini, your funds are available to trade immediately but withdrawals are only available after your bank deposits clear.

Why wasn't the "I" in "coin" shown before the guess? This is fake.

I deposited 0.5 eth, left it in for about a month then just withdrew it last week. I submitted the withdrawal on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't completed until Monday. Not sure if transactions just take 3 days or if none are processed over the weekend? Anyways everything went through no problem.

Thank you for your reply! Do you have a suggestion for securely establishing a paper wallet? I've never had one and don't know the best method to establish one that isn't created online without some kind of digital trail?

I'd argue he has done extensive research and is just lying to the public. (Mav's accept btc payments) Pushing false narratives to the public seems all to common by "Shark tankers".

Thank you for your response! So how would someone create a paper wallet that they can be certain is secure without reveling seed info online?
@_date: 2019-09-28 09:29:28
I'd guess the former.

I was thinking the same thing. Surprised at such a high interest rate on GUSD. Can it stay that high? Rates are recalculated monthly.
