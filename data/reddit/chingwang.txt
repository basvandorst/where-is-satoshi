If your trading strategy allows for a reliable 225% return on a completely unsecured crypto-commodity with low relative trading volume, then I should be seeing you all over the financial news pretty soon.  You're the trading mastermind of our entire generation.

would love to see your published work. why dont you post it here so everyone can check it out? also motivational speaker? where have you spoken?
i can't ever tell if you're masterfully trolling or actually mentally ill
also you do realize that if you ever *actually* became well known to the general populace, people would instantly start coming out of the woodwork quoting some of the insane shit you've said/posted on reddit, and your reputation would be destroyed in the blink of an eye. i mean you've completely shot yourself in both feet for any and all aspirations of 'fame'.

@_date: 2014-12-12 18:33:03
Jesus. The comments here really prove how little you people know about the finance and the banking system.
Under section 716 of the dodd frank act (which is what the article is referring to), the very very large majority of derivatives (like 95%) would not change, meaning they would not be pushed out of the bank.  so interest rate swaps, forex and credit derivatives remain in the bank. NOT pushed out.
the main items that will be pushed out are cds's and equity derivatives.  equity derivatives are not going to ever do any significant damage.  there's virtually no chance they'll damage the economy of the financial system, just by the nature of what they are. CDS's are a bit more dangerous, but A) they're being used less and B) the amount in terms of volume and notional amounts is not very large. so they're not really dangerous either.
But all you guys do is read the headline and some shitty news articles, and your minds twist that as "the governments destroying america!!! thank god we have bitcoin to fall back on!!!"
i mean...if this is how you think, no wonder you view bitcoin the way you do...

You took my comment of "we're closer to deflation than we are to hyperinflation", and extrapolated it out. I didn't say we're veering towards deflation. I simply said it's more realistic than hyperinflation is.

Our good OP is one of those who are very confused about risk.  I saw a couple redditors follow him into financial destruction back when he was trolling r/investing, so I'm not a huge fan of the guy.
@_date: 2014-12-12 21:10:09
No dude. No it's not a bad sign, nor is it a good sign.  It's just...nothing.  It's a very very minor change that will have no impact that for some reason news agencies latched on to and decided to put in the spotlight.
It involves equity derivatives.  Equity derivatives will never have the requisite impact on the financial system to bring the economy down.  The reason we were in the mess in the first place was a combination of substantially relaxed lending standards, near-fraudulent credit rating of derivatives, the blind belief of the entire industry that CDO's *eliminated* risk, and a liquidity crisis resulting from the creation of synthetic RMBS and CDO's.
That crisis was happening, regardless of whether the derivative products were pushed out, pushed in, FDIC insured, or not.
This though...this is nothing.  This "push out" that you guys are saying is the prophecy of doom.  It's just nothing.
That's why I think it's so strange.  I mean this is akin to walking outside and seeing that it's drizzling, and then running through your neighborhood screaming that the apocalypse is upon you and you need to build a second Noah's ark.  It's just...wacky.

Well this...isn't true. You bought a solid chunk around $350..your reddit history has all the evidence...
@_date: 2014-12-02 18:52:38
LOL - lets review your history with Dogecoin:
Your first posted request to buy Dogecoin was $90 for 50k coins.  That's priced at $1800 per million.  That was in January, so looking at the Dogecoin chart, it's about right...Doge was priced somewhere just below $2,000 per million.
You continued to buy Dogecoin at insane prices hovering just above or below $2000 per million.  Then you started your shitty promo posts, with titles such as:


You then continually bought more and more Doge as the price sunk, posting for purchases around $900 per million.
You then posted that you wanted to buy over a million coins for $350 per million.  This was around the time that you posted you were putting half of your divorce settlement ($10k) into Doge.
This continued for a few months before you finally quit posting about it, probably because you saw that the value of dogecoins was dropping and not stopping.
It literally could not have gone worse for you.  You bought at the top, and all you did the entire time was lose money. Consistently.
Look, I have no problem with people doing their own thing.  Do whatever you want.  But quit this whole pump and dump scheme you keep trying to pull off.  You've done it with dogecoin, cyancoin, bitcoin, various actual real stocks, etc.  It's ridiculous. All you do is lose money and try to drag other people with you.
Lose your own money if you want, but QUIT trying to bring other people down with you.  You're like a goddamn suicide bomber of peoples' personal finances.

This is a weird argument.  I mean boiling down Paypal or online banking to numbers in a ledger is misleading.  Along that line of thought you could say Bitcoin isn't a true innovation, it's just a series of binary numbers.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:34:44
My point is, Bitcoin *requires* a core critical mass of users to be a legitimately useful currency.  However, if an exchange is required for the bulk of 'mainstream users', then obviously they're not going to switch to Bitcoin because transacting through an exchange eliminates the benefit of using Bitcoin overall.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:33:24
...what's the advantage for the "mainstream user" then?  If the real client is too abstract for a mainstream user to use, then they have to turn to the exchange, and transacting through the exchange eliminates the benefit of using Bitcoin in the first place.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:02:56
Call me crazy...but isn't the main draw of Bitcoin the idea of the blockchain technology that allows for transactions between parties *without* the need for a central trusted party, like say, an exchange?

Because I circumvent the problem by using google, which means that I never have to deal with that issue?
Call it what you will, your choice whether you participate in that or not.
You also didn't address the transaction costs and the fact that Bitcoin doesn't address them. Still interested in your opinion on those.
Also still interested in some other examples (major or minor) that we need bitcoin for that can't be done with the existing infrastructure.
I'm honestly curious here, I'm not trying to prove or disprove a point.  I'd love to use bitcoin on a regular basis and for it to catch on - I just literally can't find a use for it that I can't already easily do with my existing tools.
@_date: 2015-04-09 19:26:24

Haha...you're mistakenly assuming that I have a blind spot when it comes to bitcoin. I don't.  I see *some* value in the platform. I've explored it in depth, and made a concerted effort to include it as part of my daily life.  What I found was that I just *don't need it*.  That conclusion wasn't come to out of ignorance, it was developed through an attempt at practical use.
I think there are uses for Bitcoin in a broader sense, but I do not think that it is currently a tool that would improve the general consumers life right now.
In response to your examples listed - I can honestly say that 100% of those can either be done already with existing technology, or I simply wouldn't have any use for them.
We can continue to argue, but there's no point.  Use bitcoin if it's useful for you.  All I'm saying is that it holds no use or value for me.
@_date: 2015-04-13 16:22:02

A speculative savings vehicle? That's like the definition of an oxymoron haha...
Define "much more"? I tend to be the "first adopter of new technology" kind of guy.  I created a bitcoin wallet years ago, and never saw any real reason to use bitcoin.  It's now 2015 and I still can't seem to find a use for bitcoin. There is *literally* nothing that I want to do that I need bitcoin for and can't already do with more convenience.
What were the illicit uses that made up the majority of internet traffic in the beginning? I seem to have missed that.
@_date: 2015-04-13 19:01:52
Maybe just one person's experience, but I have never in my life had this issue at all. I didn't even know this was a problem for people until you responded.
I still don't really see why that's exclusive to bitcoin though? Why not just use the existing payment infrastructure? And if you're one of those people that's worried about security, just load up a prepaid debit card exclusively for this use?
@_date: 2015-04-13 19:36:36
I get paywalls for (very) few sites, and all I have to do is use the google trick to get around them, which takes - very literally - 6 or 7 seconds.  If you don't know the google trick I can teach you.
As for the payment infrastructure fees - we don't pay those directly, vendors absorb the costs and pass them back through to consumers.  So bitcoin doesn't address that issue, as the fee is built in to whatever you'd be buying, so you'd have to pay it with or without bitcoin.
I do think it's adequate.  I guess I haven't tried to do anything creative with it, but in all honesty I'm interested in hearing examples of what you mean by that.  I haven't tried to write code against it, as the only language I know is VBA and that's purely for work.
I don't doubt that bitcoin as a system is superior - my argument is that as shitty as the existing infrastructure is, it works perfectly fine for me.  I'm purely on the consumer side though. So I'm missing a large chunk of the requisite experience for understanding the benefits of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-14 14:26:59

Utility: Why would I ever use bitcoin when there are a million options for payment already out there? Aside from traditional payment methods, Venmo is *easier* to use than bitcoin, so why not use that?

It's not hate for bitcoin. It's an aversion to people like americanpegasus who become radical.  I mean all you have to do is go through his post history for the past few months - it's like going through the rabbithole into the mind of a zealot.  I see people like him frequently on reddit who legitimately support bitcoin, but are insane and manic about it and shove it down every single persons' throat that they encounter.
I think bitcoin has some incredible potential.  At the same time, I wouldn't put my money towards buying them.  But whenever some psychopath ambles along screeching about how "fiat" is literally the devil and that bitcoin is our savior and whoever doesn't agree deserves to burn in hell - it makes me super uncomfortable and I just want to get away as fast as possible.
Unfortunately there are A LOT of those types of people, so bitcoin now has that image attached to it.

This year has seen a ~45% max drawdown in value...but yea, it's exhibited phenomenal "stability".....

Wait. Are you serious? You can't be serious.
Apply any (seriously ANY) measure of volatility to the price of Bitcoin and to the value of the stock market (take any index, I don't care) and let me know what you find.

Does no one else see the irony of a BTC fund priced in USD? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of bitcoin? Why not just hold bitcoin?
Also - the fund is paying all of its fees out of the bitcoins it holds.  So unless bitcoin continues to increase in value at a pace that exceeds the annual fee expense, NAV will inevitably decline.
This just seems like a terrible investment.
