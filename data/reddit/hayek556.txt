You're not copying pasting the network. the network isn't a hard disk... huge competitive aspect of crypto is the network.
"Why would I want to buy bitcoin when I could just DUPLICATE the protocol, make my own bitcoins"... That's how you sound. 
Cryptos arnt movies or files

With different consensus protocols and or network/ ledgers... 
"Look me and my friends created our own central banking systems cloned after the federal reserve banking system... the world will value it the same because copy past equals duplicate"

By segwit compatable, do they mean they sre saving unspent output history as proofs for a later date when others are do as well?

Your examples are synonymous to forking rather than duplicating. You can't change who owns the addresses and private keys of the duplicate. Sure you can copy and paste the bitcoin protocol but you'de be starting over... That's not a duplicate cheese brain.

Haha 
It's not valued the same because your network nodes (banks) differ in quantity, size and reputation. You havnt duplicated anything.

Take away the means of transaction and you’re left with a commodity without tangibility. Gold or real-estate are not very good at being means of transactions yet they are very tangible... gold is the best conductor of electricity and real estate keeps you out of the rain, it increases in value parallel to the increase in population.  Bitcoin has nothing else to offer. It’s a novelty... currency competition is the name of the game...

Great point. I’ll add it

I don’t agree that a means of exchange has and ever will be 5% of bitcoins speculative value. I mean fuel efficiency/ comfort might be 5% of a nostalgic automobile’s speculative value but bitcoin isn’t as tangible as a car. 
Faster and cheeper transaction times are a trade off for integrity?? proof of data integrity is the same for Bcash vs bitcoin core. Transaction fees are a result competition for transaction confirmation. What does that have to do with integrity? Honest question.

Lol “praying on new comers?”...  this must be stopped at once! Somebody call the government!

Would it be immoral to open up a fast food joint called burger queen? 
I think it would be immoral for any collective to prohibit someone from doing so... morality is more effectively debated with principle rather than emotion.
