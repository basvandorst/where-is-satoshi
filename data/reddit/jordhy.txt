Bitcoin is programmable money. Here are some of the things it allows you to do:
1. It allows machine to machine payment
2. Anonymous transactions
3. Decentralized wealth preservation
4. International transfers
5. Micro payments
6. Document notarization
7. Distributed autonomous corporations
8. Governmental fiscal policy circumvention
9. Purchases across the globe without exchanging currency
10. Mobile payments
11. Paper wallet money preservation
12. Real-time macroeconomic monitoring
13. Stateless company creation
14. Hedging against the fiat economy
15. Unregulated stock purchases
16. Unregulated bond purchases
17. SHA-256 encryption with stronger levels of security than visa or master card
18. No chargebacks
19. Discounts in major merchants
20. 10 minute transaction confirmation
21. Wealth storage and backup
There are also many advantages for merchants:
22. Lower processing fees
23. Digital money that can be processed with commodity hardware
24. No chargebacks
25. No fraud
26. Instant provisioning of funds
27. Cater to tourist without currency conversion

29. Automatic conversion of bitcoins to the currency of your choice via bit pay
30. A way to pay suppliers with no commissions
And so it goes, bitcoin is the most powerful economic revolution of the last couple of centuries.

I have both circle and coinbase. In my opinion circle is much better because withdrawals happen the day after, you get bitcoins instantly and there are no overdraft fees. 
I also like that circle keeps my balance in US dollars no matter how much bitcoin fluctuates.

The news is that Bitcoin is the honey badger of money!
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:45:30
I like bitshares most because they have a solid community and a mature development team. I expect this area to be far bigger than bitcoin the currency itself.
