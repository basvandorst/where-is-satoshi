I'm currently the acting president for my school's Bitcoin club. How can I contact Bsafe?

And how easy would it be to write a malicious Android app that makes the JSONRPC request on a phone running Electrum, (thus making the request locally,) and reports the seed back to an attacker?

This is probably one of the best ways to predict prices- seeing how much people think its worth.

Hi Jeremiah.
@_date: 2015-06-27 02:42:19
I agree. Despite everything going digital, the paper I kept hidden saved my bacon this time.
@_date: 2015-06-27 03:35:17
That's a rather good point. I never really ran the client or accessed information on that partition on a regular basis, but that is a good thought.

Hey, thanks for bringing this up. I neglected to mention it in the OP due to my panicked state, but I did try and use some recovery software to try and recover some data. No dice I'm afraid.
@_date: 2015-12-25 01:27:50
Cheers, and happy halving!
@_date: 2015-06-27 02:18:14
Still lost ~5 Litecoins though. For everyone who has stake in those... Enjoy the slightly increased valuation of your currency.
@_date: 2014-01-05 17:34:02
So quantum computing still sounds pretty far off, and even if a computer that could destroy the bitcoin blockchain were to surface there's a contingency plan in place. Who carries out the contingency plan?
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:56:53
More like $0.0003
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:37:35
 &gt; who fucking knows!
Yeah, in a nutshell...
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:01:38
You're on.
@_date: 2016-12-23 21:04:36
If that was an actual question, the answer is no. A hack that leaks private keys of their Vault system would end the same way as any other, with you losing all of your coins.
If you're being facetious... Well then I took the bait.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:27:54
Huh, I forgot about changetip. I had $50 sitting in there. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:06:15
This doesn't seem right...

Finally, something I can do while shorting ETH
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:16:17
It's likely those targeted addresses would have a high balance (i.e. one of Satoshi's wallets) that it would be immediately noticed. Imagine a headline: "*Someone* just withdraw all of the funds from Satoshi's original wallet!"
Once this happens once or twice, people will **definitely** start wondering if the protocol is broken.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:47:47
Get that green.
Green charts, that is.
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:27:39
Hm, yes China likely has a role too. But the idea still stands, just replace "JP Morgan" with "Global Superpower"!
@_date: 2015-09-25 20:23:33
Just sent them an email for a price estimate.
@_date: 2015-09-25 16:25:32
I'm mainly worried about profitability. A bunch of broke college students aren't likely to pour money into a mining rig unless they're sure they'll get some BTC out of it. 
@_date: 2015-09-25 19:02:53
But in how long, roughly? I know it's hard to say with difficulty and price flux, but any rough estimate?
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:57:42
I've been a Bitcoin owner since 2011 and just did my first purchase with it.
Congrats, you've earned my my first Bitcoin expenditure.

This is as close as we can get for now, unless someone wants to publish unsigned binaries somewhere (which I doubt will happen or will receive much adoption).
We need official adoption by a reputable developer, using unsigned binaries for something like Bitcoin is a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-05-15 02:56:49


Why don't we set a goal? Might as well, activism is the only thing that's going to get us anywhere.


Maybe we could implement an easier way for Core users to switch between BIP148/149/etc? Like a setup wizard of sorts, with a brief explanation of each BIP, and an option to activate one or multiple. I imagine such a feature could be difficult to make such that it works across many platforms and implementations. Maybe something like this already exists, I haven't had a chance to read up on it.

I think he means Bitcoins share of the cryptocurrency market cap as a whole.
@_date: 2016-05-04 00:47:23
I'm no Bitcoin expert, but I can see that he's lacking some serious proof. Only a rudimentary knowledge of crypto/Bitcoin is needed to see that.
@_date: 2017-05-15 05:03:28


Basically no. But the process for mining alts is very similar, assuming you aren't using ASICs.
@_date: 2017-05-15 03:57:05


I like the sounds of that. A kind of Bitcoin Congress. A group of representatives for the miners, investors/holders, end-users, devs, etc. A transparent electoral system with true accountability and trustless-ness.

How's your Skittles flavor?
@_date: 2017-05-15 04:19:12
I trust and value your views on this greatly, so I have to ask: wouldn't we want at least some representation of the miners? Even though they are holding the network hostage right now, I feel they are still important to Bitcoin's functioning. Wouldn't ignoring them be ignoring an important portion of Bitcoin's community, paramount to its proper function?
@_date: 2017-05-15 03:11:59
So say UASF doesn't go through. What would a PoW change entail? What PoW algorithm would Bitcoin switch to, in your opinion?
@_date: 2016-05-04 02:26:25
Cripes, I can't even pick a good meme from Google correctly!
@_date: 2015-03-17 14:06:11
I think it depends on how well Bitcoin can adapt to become end-user oriented rather than an investment or a quirk. There are other crypto-currencies out there that are more practical for an end-user than Bitcoin, so it's really up to us and the developers to make Bitcoin innovative and relevant to the average person.
In a nutshell, I think Bitcoin's future is largely up in the air. It's every Bitcoin owner's job to help change that.
@_date: 2017-05-15 05:11:25
If you don't use the node for sending/receiving transactions, there is no benefit to the network (as far as I can tell) besides pumping up UASF's node count.
However there are guides online that you can find with a simple Google search.
@_date: 2017-06-29 02:52:54
What exactly did you do?
@_date: 2017-06-29 02:46:48
I'm not seeing anything here.
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:26:29
Trading doesn't seem too complicated. My idea of trading is probably what you ardent bitcoiners call common sense: when the price goes down, buy, and when it goes up, sell. At this point however, I'm only looking to be ready to buy if the price declines significantly.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:34:37
Congrats man! I turned 17 yesterday and mined my 2.29 BTC back in 2011. Its very exciting isn't it?
Good luck in the future!
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:10:18
I think if my parents are aware and consent it wouldn't be an issue, and that happens to be the case. I would sort of be acting as a bitcoin broker for them, of sorts.
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:08:59
I probably should've mentioned this in the OP, but my parents are all for "investing" in bitcoin. They're a bit iffy about giving an exchange their credentials, but as long as they're aware of it and an exchange accepts them, would it be okay for me to use their account to trade, since they can't be expected to make smart decisions in this market? (Then again is anyone really...?)
