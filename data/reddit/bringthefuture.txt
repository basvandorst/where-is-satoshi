It doesn't matter what were you the last 9 years, what it matters is what are you right now. And BTC right now is shit with slow and expensive transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:39:56
Thanks for your reply, I learned a lot of things about Bitcoin now.
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:07:00
Humans total supply 7 billion, in circulation only 50 million. 
Even 2.5 Billion people doesnt have bank account, but hey! With a phone and internet they can be their own bank thanks to decentralized blockchain tech.
So yes, I am very serious here.
Can Bitcoin handle Cryptokitties on his smart contracts? No.
Are Bitcoin fees $0.05? No.
Is BTC planing to move to a more efficient and green system such us POS? No.
When you call BTC robust, is that because is a massive dinosaur? Yes.
I totally lost it when you said BTC most important feature is that is not easy to change! 
You BTC bagholders are so brainwashed at 
its all memes and people defending BTC without arguments.

Larger pool of developers and of better quality that are not able to deliver some features such as fast and cheap if not free transactions like many of the newer crypto coins. And don't get me started with the smart contracts, digital ID... Etc etc. Bitcoin is about to get dethroned and yet you are in denial praising that large premium pool of devs that most probably are fleeing to develop on other platforms/cryptos for good.
Im sorry for the BTC bagholders. But times change and you either change and adapt or you will face extintion (become a coin for collectors only).
Clock is ticking, if BTC has any chance to survive as king, the upgrades have to be developed quickly.

We sell high and buy low down under ;)

Nothing to worry about, Bitcoin is a money printing machine, look at Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold, free top rank marketcaps. Not many people seems to care this days after so many forks.
Right now BTC is a blackhole absorbing ratios against the rest of Cryptos, doesn't seem like fresh money comming in but rather moving between cryptos driven by the greed of getting free coins worth maybe four figures... Place your own bet.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:05:25
He nailed it!
Same blocksize, an increasing amount of pending transactions.. 250k tx... $20 transfer fees... No planned onchain scaling solutions... Yep a well deserved new drama because nothing of substance has changed on bringing a solution to BTC serious problems that the average JOE is already experiencing and dislikes.

Hhahhahahahha lost it when the Tesla flipped the Lambo

I don't need your money, money.

So you are betting that in lets say 15 years FIAT will still mantain its value.
What if crypto takes over and makes the Zimbawe/Venezuela inflations a worldwide norm?
I would put maybe 1/2 Funds Fiat and 1/2 Crypto for my Kid, that way you are kinda covered against the Fiat collapse if it ever happens and a lot of people speculate on it and would love to see it happening one day.
Stay safe.
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:21:07
Bigger than the block size for sure.

I can feel the vibration on my tablet when playing it.
@_date: 2019-02-20 07:23:53
I just happened to divide 17,548,175 BTC circulating supply by 7,700,000,000 Earths Population... and the result is 227,898 sats or 0.00227898 BTC per person if equally distributed.
This is considering no BTC was ever lost and every human creature equally owned some.
The ratio shall be similar given half of the population 3,850,000,000 earthlings equally shared 9,000,000 BTC after discounting Genesis BTC and the lost BTC from lost hard drives and forgotten keys.

You need to multiply x1000 every number mentioned in the article.
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:22:39
Come to Binance, you can see 5000 BTC walls being destroyed
@_date: 2019-02-20 12:38:52
Negative. It is in my equation.

Yep, same thing I can say about Spain in the 2008 Bust, sleeping empty cities and apartments all along the coast, newly built, half way built... empty and abandoned.
The difference with China is that its economy is much diverse.
Youth unemployment was at 60% at some point and global rate was 25% if not mistaken... still recovering 10 years later.
I had to move overseas, soo many overqualified scientist and engineers fighting for a job in a bar.
The Government saved bank's ass with taxpayer money. Injection of Liquidity here and there and same sh*t year after year. I'm just here siting and waiting for the printing money based economy to go bust.

So you are, typed 6 for 6 times.
@_date: 2018-11-12 01:19:11
Congrats! Don't forget you also own 75 BCH as well, a Tesla worth of BCH that you can sell ;)
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:22:08
Right... its 2019 already! And February is just a couple of days away! Time flies and still glued into Crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:34:05
Go Binance bro and sue the shit out of them.
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:02:30
Right, for day traders for example they might execute few trades durimg the day BTC/USD back and forth. So that tops up the volume but it's the same individual.
Then you have the other majority who buy their BTC with USD to later take it to their prefered exchange and buy their NEO, POWR or whatever they like.
We have to read the data, not only look at it!
But yes, its the principal medium of exchange anyway!
@_date: 2018-04-04 07:18:13
Ah ok Thanks, then where is $10Billion a day data source comming from? I guess total BTC flying around the blockchain in 24h multiplied by price of each BTC.
I wonder how much of that total are exchanges moving from Cold to Hot wallets and viceversa.

Sorry for your loss... I have a big faith in Digital ID projects that will tackle this security flaw to the core. If mobile/internet carriers integrate the security level blockchain has to offer as being linked to your ID and make that "cyber-money" not able to move without your bioauthorization.
