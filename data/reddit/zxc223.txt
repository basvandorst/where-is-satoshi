Well I spend an agonising 10 minutes or so checking for a $5k transfer, so probably... for 114.5 days?

Absolutely. That's what I did and what everyone should do. I don't mean you should rely on memory alone.

I don't understand why you would want to 'store' your electrum wallet anywhere. The whole point of electrum is that you memorise your 12 word seed and then you can access that wallet any time with the seed. (note that most users should not import any keys to an electrum wallet as the seed won't restore those)

Eight-year-old me would have been utterly fascinated with these.

I second this method. The Pi is optional: you can disconnect the internet cable on your PC and boot from an Ubuntu USB with Electrum installed.
To transfer from your cold wallet to your hot wallet, create the unsigned transaction with your watch-only wallet, then boot in Ubuntu/preferred Linux distro and use Electrum to sign the transaction. Then just place the signed transaction file on another USB, boot regularly, and broadcast the signed transaction.
The entire process takes a bit of time if you boot Ubuntu via USB but you shouldn't need to withdraw from your cold wallet very often.

What they might be referring to is the ability to sign raw transactions. For instance you can transfer by USB a raw unsigned transaction to an always-offline computer, sign it with your private key, format the USB, transfer the signed transaction, and take the USB to an online computer and broadcast the transaction. Then you will have made a transaction with your cold wallet without it ever being vulnerable.

That would be how to handle a cold wallet, which you shouldn't have to withdraw from very often. The OP wanted a way to securely store BTC for the future, which means they will be wanting a cold wallet.

If you get 20% extra credit for the normal price, then it's equivalent to paying 1.0/1.2 or 83.33% of the full price of that credit, which is 16.67% off. Still a good deal, but not quite 20% off.

I have sold bitcoins with them in the last month. I consider them trustworthy.

I said that in early 2011! I'm not kidding...
