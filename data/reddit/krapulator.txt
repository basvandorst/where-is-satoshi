Personally I'd rather see coin to fiat, but I recognize that fiat to coin is more useful for giving more people access to BTC.

Some of the ATM's being rolled out elsewhere in the world are two-way. No doubt we'll some them at some point. Until then Localbitcoins or Coinjar will do the job.

Yeah if it's more than 2%, then I'll just stick with Coinjar

I would argue that the convention is for an ATM to dispense fiat cash.

One simple reason is that many vendors offer generous discounts for paying by Bitcoin!
Since the transaction charges for the vendor are dramatically less than other payment methods and the danger of charge-backs is completely removed, they can pass the savings on!

Great paper guys! Here's hoping the ATO's position is something along these lines.

At Sydney’s Bitcoin Barcamp conference on Saturday, a mixture of libertarians, entrepreneurs and traders gathered to proclaim the future is virtual currency. 
Mt Gox, Bitcoin’s biggest exchange that lost $US567 million of customer assets, or Silk Road, the web site that allows narcotics to be bought and sold using bitcoins, were not discussed at the conference.  
Instead, optimism reigned among the mostly male conference participants who proclaimed that Bitcoin or a similar crypto currency was how people would pay for goods and services in the future.
They are not alone. Some on Wall Street agree.
“We believe Bitcoin can become a major means of payment for e-commerce and may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money transfer providers,” says Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s foreign exchange and rates strategist David Woo.
On a couch in the corner of the conference at the Australian Technology Park, Bitcoin broker CoinJar gave this reporter $20 worth of bitcoin which were then transferred offline to a bitcard that looks a little like a regular eftpos card and can be used like one.   
CoinJar cofounder Asher Tan likens his company to a moneychanger. Mr Tan, 27, and Ryan Zhou, 19, started their company last year. It already has more than 20,000 customers across Australia who pay for pizza, beer and coffee using bitcoin. CoinJar, backed by Blackbird Ventures, prices bitcoins using a variety of offshore Bitcoin exchanges.
“We are treating Bitcoin exactly like money,” says Mr Tan.
But Bitcoin is not money, says Matthew Cridland, a partner at DLA Piper Australia.
Bitcoin in Australia is a non-monetary consideration, says Mr Cridland -- it does not meet the country’s current definition of a currency.
In the future, Australia may define as currency so-called crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is declared a currency then Bitcoin transactions will be subject to the goods and services tax as they are in Canada and Singapore, says Mr Cridland.   
A bitcoin was worth the equivalent of $US20 at the beginning of 2013. It is now valued at $US630 after rising above $US1000 last year. There are about 11 million bitcoins in circulation worth about $US9 billion, according to George Samman from btc.sx, a bitcoin trading platform that allows leverage bets on bitcoin.
“There’s a lot of money to be made on bitcoin arbitrage,” says Mr Samman, who is moving to New York from Sydney to trade Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s bid-offer spread is as wide as $US15, he says.
Employees from Goldman Sachs visited CoinJar to find out more about the company that has traded more than $24 million worth of bitcoins in its first eight months of existence.
CoinJar makes its money by charging a 1 per cent fee when Bitcoin users exchange bitcoins for Australian dollars and a 2 per cent fee when Australian dollars are exchanged for bitcoins.
BitPos, a bitcoin point of sale provider that does business with CoinJar, charges a 1 per cent merchant fee per transaction. It has 25 merchants using its services including pubs and fitness clubs.
“The genie is out of the bottle,” says Jason Williams, a BitPos founder. “Crypto currencies will be as ubiquitous as the Australian dollar.”

An unconfirmed transaction is not the same as a double spend. In this case, re-broadcasting the transaction would probably be enough to push it through.

2% is fair. I've read that some of the ones overseas are 8% which is excessive.

Unbelievable how ignorant some of this thread is and how quick everyone is to call "scam" on something they clearly know nothing about. 
Ethereum solves a completely different problem than Bitcoin and is a complimentary technology rather than a competing one.
Before calling scam, go and watch some of the videos with the founder, the LTB episodes that cover it and the Etherium blog.
It may or may not end up being a feasible or successful effort, but there's no doubt that the ideas behind it are visionary and innovative (not to mention that they are taking blockchain technology to a whole new level)
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:26:34
The failure of Mt Gox will inform how all exchanges do business moving forward. Proof of solvency via the Blockchain will now be an expectation of all next generation exchanges.

Create a new address. Tell the user in advance that at a certain predefined time you will transfer a small predefined amount from address you own to new address. (Signing a message would also work, but is a bit more complicated).
@_date: 2014-03-15 20:55:15
It doesn't have to be one or the other. I believe in Bitcoin and what it represent AND I want to make money! 
If Bitcoin is the great innovation that most of us believe it is, then mass adoption will be exponential whether the community wants that or not. 
I think you're overstating the problems here. All of the issues you have raised are being addressed right now. These are just teething issues.

As a convenient and instant way to liquidate BTC to AUD when I want to buy stuff. Very few vendors in Sydney accept BTC at this point :-(

I recently had some issues with a deposit into Coinjar and Asher was really helpful and went above and beyond to sort it out. I now use them exclusively to get AUD into BTC.
I haven't used their mobile app however.

Companies holding large amounts of coin would use multi-sig wallets.

The distribution of mining power provides a counterbalance to the foundation. If the foundation dictated an unpopular or compromising change to the protocol, miners could simply band together and refuse to implement it. I see this as another demonstration of Satoshis brilliance.
@_date: 2013-09-13 03:37:58
What makes it more frustrating is that the price of a coin was only about $80 when I first transferred the money.
@_date: 2013-09-19 09:05:39
Its simple enough....for high value in person retail sales ask them to come back in 30 mins and pick up the goods.

I've noticed delays in BTC withdrawls from Gox lately. My last withdrawal a few days ago took about 24 hours. You should be OK.

@_date: 2013-11-24 19:42:46
At the risk of being that guy - it's not actually at the speed of light. A transaction generated from a node is going to travel through at least a couple of routers/switches/gateways to broadcast to connected peers. Each of these hops will introduce a small delay to the movement of the data packets.
The peers then need to rebroadcast it, which will also require packets bouncing around the web through multiple routers/switches/gateways. I'd reckon at best half the speed of light :-D

It was good PR for Paypal to say this, but there's very little chance they will do it. Bitcoin makes Paypal  redundant.
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:56:12
I would argue that Bitcoin does in fact have intrinsic value. The underlying cryptography, the decentralised network, the ability to transfer money instantly anywhere without permission and the control it endows to the consumer are all intrinsically valuable properties.
