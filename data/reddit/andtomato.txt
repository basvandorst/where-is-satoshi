What I see is that outside the US, people pay less money than US citizens for healthcare, this accounts for taxes obviously, and with that money everybody is covered.  
So it looks like US citizens pay more than the rest just to have the privilege of not paying poor peoples healthcare.
 . 
So, in general, US citizens are paying much more and receiving way less, it would benefit everybody financially to move into universal healthcare.   
And thats just financially, without taking in account other matters like population wellbeing etc...

sorry, but why would the people spending less than 4k a year be fucked?  taxes would still be percentages, this are just average numbers.

They actually do.  
Doctors get paid their salary, nurses get paid their salary and they do their work, there is no billing involved, so there are savings because there is no need for accountants or billing departments, or sales departments.

That health insurance companies are sucking US citizens dry

Apparently you don't even know how to read and understand. 
The comment says they can be compensated the same way, obviously not the same amounts Sherlock.

69% of Americans have less than 1k in savings, it doesn't take much to reach that paying for deductibles.
You are right with the non necessary treatments, but there will always be private hospitals that take care of that, non necessary treatments should not be subsidised with taxes.

Do firefighters work for free? How about police? do they work for free or do we force them to work without compensation?
The same way firefighters and police work, doctors can.  
Its not only possible, but its actually working in lots of developed countries.

are you 12?
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:21:21
that trade was for an amount like 5 dollars
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:23:40
how about deductibles, excluded stuff and things like that?  
How common is to have insurance and not pay a single dollar on top of it?
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:20:15
Sorry but no, its not at the totals, its per capita, which is an average by itself.  
You could pick, for example the UK, any person in the US spending more than 4k a year in healthcare(insurance+deductibles+associated costs) would benefit from such a system financially, as a bonus, all UK citizens are covered.  
Compared to at least a few European countries, the healthcare quality is similar and the population wellbeing is better, even life expectancy is higher.  
I get the feeling that when the US brags about healthcare quality they are talking about cutting edge treatments that the 1%ers can actually afford, I don't think 99% of the citizens get better care in the US.

Never got a bill or known the price of any of the procedures received in 3 different european countries.

I clearly differentiated between both, they will obviously be compensated according to their job.  
Besides, you are writing like it doesn't happen anywhere, and there are dozens of countries where this is happening, government pays doctors, policemen, firemen and all sort of public servants, and the wages are obviously proportionate to their jobs.

So could you not pay for your own police force?  
Public school teachers? 
Can't you pay insurance for firefighters?  
Also, universal healthcare benefits the public a lot:  
* vaccination policies for disease control
* Treat people early with preventive care and avoid much higher ER costs later down the line
* A healthy population doesn't miss work, and keep producing

I never said they were for free, you are the one talking about working without compensation.  
I merely pointed out that you do get other services provided in that manner and that the same could be applied, like it happens in many other places.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:47:35
sorry, I thought you were the OP.  
he wrote about working without compensation.  
Why do we consider bad that doctors work for the government but not police? or public teachers? or firefighters?  
End of the day, looking at healthcare spending, the US gets much less bang per buck than countries with universal healthcare, people are spending more and getting less, for the privilege of not paying for my poor neighbours healthcare.

Thanks, that was very insightful.  
The problem I see is that we could sit here and design the perfect government without knowing it for sure, as you just said, there are too many unknowns.  
But while we do sit here and talk about it, neighbors go bankrupt for diseases, or worse, they die because they can't pay for it.  
I'd sit and talk about what government is best forever, but maybe we could do that from a more stable situation, this is not theoretical, plenty of countries implemented it already.  
So, while I agree everything is discussable and should be decided upon, I am not comfortable doing it while fellow citizens are dying unnecessarily. I'd be ready to give up for a while into a maybe non-optimal situation while we solve it.

Well, it does depend on what the stakes are don't you think?  
If we are surrounded by sharks it might not be the best moment to decide what policy decides who climbs first to the boat.  
How about we climb in the same order those from 2 boats away did and save both our lives and then we decide what the policy should be?
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:43:06
Thats the point, why do you argue healthcare is not a public good but police and firefighting are? what is the rationale?

A fork effectively splits the blockchain in 2 with the same past, like a " Y ", your coins exist on both chains, so you can transact them separately on both, therefore, you can sell 1 BCH and 1 BTC.

What usb cable/adapter is that?

Segwit chain will have more transactions per block, allowing for more money of fees.
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:25:27
That might be true, but regardless, if the shit hits the fan, transactions/hour will be a very important metric.

Till the difficulty is adjusted with much less hashrate it will take much longer to produce blocks, not every 10 minutes, specially since you need 2048 blocks to adjust difficulty.
