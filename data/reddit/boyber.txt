Interesting Rassah, I guess you're a JT fan? I was kind of joking because he's clearly a scammer. His usual business is promoting his "free seminars" to teach you to become a coach and speaker. If you look him up there's lots of people who've been ripped off by him. 
Are you the Rassah who is involved in Mycelium?

No one is forcing anyone to donate to anything - donate to whatever you think is valuable.
But that said, Dark Wallet is one of the only projects truly on the frontline of bitcoin's potential. It's on the bleeding edge of fulfilling bitcoin's value. It's therefore extremely worthy of being supported.
The examples you mention are all great in their own ways, but they're not as gamechanging as Dark Wallet.
Also, I would expect to see the wallets you mention implementing Dark Wallet's tech once it is properly released, so the team is providing very valuable R&amp;D.

I have a verso card and it's great. BUT you need to consider whether you can fully trust a company with your private key (Verso claim that they never see it unencrypted - and I take them on their word - so far).

Also a fair point. It depends how she framed it to you guys when she arranged the interview. She had built up trust with her previous piece, so what did she say this one was about?

I just got scammed doing some writing work for a guy who asked me for the work very quickly (which I did) then he basically disappeared without sending me the BTC. I'd be interested in a way to mitigate this kind of risk.

Yes they do - a small percentage fee of the sale - but only if you sell something. Otherwise you simply list your item for sale and leave it up there. It's actually easier than eBay because you use the discogs user-generated catalogue instead of listing the item yourself.

Given that the terrorist tag has been used to push through just about anything the authorities want, I would say it's pretty bad for bitcoin if it gets labelled in this way.

What rate do they use when you buy BTC? What is their commission?
@_date: 2014-07-02 14:48:06
I'm from the UK and am also getting excited at the moment. I just think so many businesses are getting involved with BTC the fundamentals are very strong. The only thing that concerns me is the responsibility with being your own bank - so many people are getting their bitcoins stolen, you really do have to take proper precautions with cold storage etc. This is why Coinbase/Xapo/Netagio insured vaults are a good idea for many people - even if it centralises things to a certain extent.
@_date: 2014-06-27 14:23:20
Sounds interesting - keep us updated.
@_date: 2014-08-26 14:29:48
Indeed, but if discogs could implement, for example, bitpay into their system buyers could get a choice how they want to pay.
BTW this is why I don't agree with OP's assertion that there is a middleman here - surely it's direct from buyer to seller. Discogs take a percentage for advertising the sales but otherwise it's direct.
It would be a massive job to build something on the scale of discogs now.

I looked into this earlier this year and I'm sorry to say... it isn't that easy. Basically the boss in Korea will need to buy BTC, send them to you and then you can sell them in the UK using Localbitcoins, bittylicious, or an exchange like netagio or coinfloor. 
The hardest part is convincing the boss to go through the AML/KYC process needed to buy BTC from an exchange in Korea. 
I believe there are some companies being set up to facilitate getting paid in BTC - bitpay are running a trial at the moment I think - but it's just not as easy as it should be for the time being.
Once companies like Circle are up and running the process should be simpler but until then you might be best off transferring her wages using [transferwise](
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:01:35

I agree. Zipzap is also a good option if you just want to buy a small-ish amount of BTC. It was more interesting to me that they are soon to introduce debit and credit card payments. Although if the fees are this high there's not a chance I will use it.

They are really promoting bitcoin heavily. I sold some electronics for bitcoin and I was the first in the store to do so. Unfortunately the staff haven't been trained too well and the store wasn't too set up to make BTC transactions, so it took a few trips and confusion to make it work. They require you to sign up on their website and add a bitcoin address to your profile, then you sell your stuff and they transfer it at pretty much the global average rate. It would be better if stores had a tablet or phone that could simply scan a QR code of your wallet rather than having to sign up with them, but hey, at least it's possible. And the BTC was transferred pretty instantly after the staff had finally figured out how to make it work.

I spoke to an Argentinian friend yesterday who was very aware of what is happening to the currency and the different ways people are trying to move their money. She hadn't heard of Bitcoin, which suggests to me it's not as widespread there as we might like to think. Shame - apparently the government there can even take your gold if it's stored in a vault.

In the UK the easiest way is via  though you will pay about a £20 premium on the market rate for one bitcoin. Localbitcoins is also good but you will pay a similar premium. Compared to the hassle of sending money to a bank in Poland or Germany, plus exchange fees etc, it's the best way

It doesn't matter if there's a backdoor or not if it can be "highjacked" for use as a one-world currency. It also has the "benefit" of every transaction being recorded publicly. Initiatives like Darkwallet are very interesting from this perspective of course.

Also just to add on a personal level, I've found [Zipzap]( by far the easiest and cheapest way to buy Bitcoin in the UK at the moment. Only for smaller amounts (less than £300) though. For more you need to go with an exchange.
Actually, I think [bittybot]( just added some global exchanges that you can use with GBP.

Looks good to me but if you're concerned you could try breadwallet, which is open source.
It's certainly possible, and preferable, to store a private key on a device. Just don't load it with many bitcoins - keep the rest in cold storage.
@_date: 2014-10-13 19:39:42
Still don't really know when Dark Wallet will be released or how it's going.
@_date: 2014-11-28 14:48:29
Because they only allow you to submit BIP38 encrypted private keys, so it doesn't matter if they have a back-up.
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:52:46
A couple of useful threads in @_date: 2014-09-20 09:24:19
Thanks that's understandable.
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:09:27
It was similar to any other AML/KYC type process - ID plus scan of recent bill or bank statement. I was verified within a couple of days I think. 
I have since found out that apparently you don't need to be verified to buy, but I haven't confirmed this.
Once you're verified you then select the shop nearest you and the amount you want to buy, print out the order and take it to the shop with your cash. The shopkeeper scans the barcode, you pay, then about an hour later the BTC is transferred. At least it took my purchase about an hour.
One thing though: the first shop I ordered from didn't even have PayZone and didn't know why they were listed. I had to reorder (there's no way to cancel) from a different shop. But now I know the process this is the way I will be buying BTC from now on.
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:44:10
Wonder why?
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:48:40

@_date: 2014-11-10 16:31:00
I've used it and it was great. The only issue I had was that the first shop I went to didn't even do PayZone although they were listed on zipzap's website.

I always remember Gavin's response to a question when he was on a panel once (it was posted here, can't remember which one it was now) about whether bitcoin could be used to launder money. He spent an awkward few moments not being able to respond, then said it would make it easier to launder money! The subtext, to me at least, was that he was aware that it was being used to launder money. 
One of the other panel members managed to pull things round with a better response, but Gavin's response was very telling, I thought.

It's a great idea. Though a quicker way might be to persuade discogs.com to let sellers accept Bitcoin as a payment option. Someone asked them last year but the response was that if more people request it they will implement it.

@_date: 2014-08-10 23:23:40
Your only other option is something like  netagio.com but even then you will pay a percentage over the exchange rate to buy.

Looks like you have to use a wire transfer rather than this being a UK-based bank. Shame, because everything else looks good - decent fees, nice site, no heavy KYC/AML requirements up to a certain value.

So how does this work? Is it still via SEPA or genuine UK banking? Because SEPA incurs costs to transfer.

"Any large corporation would leave itself open to a huge amount of risk if it began to accept transactions that aren't approved by trusted servers, but instead by "the community at large."" - FALSE.
But also according to the article Amazon has a strained relationship with banks: "Much of that animosity stems from the fact that they won't provide Amazon with the purchasing information that it thrives upon."
Maybe Amazon balked at bitcoin for this very reason: they can't extract enough information out of it on their customers.
Otherwise a bit of a silly and unnecessarily scathing article.

Get [Electrum]( for your wallet to start with. That's more than secure for most people and in terms of anonymity it's good because it generates a new address every time you send or receive bitcoin.
If you have an Android phone [Mycelium]( is best. If iOS [Breadwallet](
If you want to take things offline and have paper wallets, that's more complex but definitely more secure. There are plenty of guides around to help with this but you do need to know what you're doing.
An easier way might be to get a [Mycelium Entropy]( when they are released (which should be soon) and one of the recommended printers and print your paper wallet that way.
In terms of buying bitcoin it's not really possible to be totally anonymous at this time. If you're in the US just sign up for Circle or Coinbase and transfer the bitcoin you buy to your Electrum wallet or your paper wallet.
By moving your money from fiat into bitcoin you're already doing something amazing - you're building a new monetary system.

Oops I meant "can't".

I see what you did there. Except bitcoin is a solution to a problem that definitely exists: the banks (among many other problems). And while it IS technical and difficult to grasp for mainstream people, it's not nearly as difficult as ethereum. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:39:24

Bitcoin for the elderly?
@_date: 2014-12-06 15:44:41
Yes I guess so. It just needs to be something simple so people who have no idea about bitcoin can buy them easily using their credit card.

OK if George "bilderberg" Osborne is embracing bitcoin NOW I'm paranoid.

Interesting, I didn't know that. Always had good dealings with Transferwise before they were forced to stop transferring money to bitcoin companies. I see Richard Branson is also an investor in Transferwise and of course he's been pretty supportive of bitcoin too, investing in Bitpay.
@_date: 2014-08-19 09:08:13
Yes Coinfloor might be your best option, or maybe [Netagio]( otherwise Localbitcoins - but I appreciate the problem of having no feedback. There's also [bittylicious]( where you can become a seller.
In terms of banks in the UK, to be honest they're mostly as bad as each other, so just pick one that has a branch near where you will be staying.
There's also [Transferwise]( which is a good option for sending money from abroad.
@_date: 2014-10-15 08:53:51
Sure looks like it. Shame.
@_date: 2014-10-24 10:25:59
Interesting concept. Any thoughts?
@_date: 2014-10-15 09:53:04
Does it mean that we can use UK banks to exchange for BTC? If so, I wonder how they've achieved that? If not, does it mean there are going to be conversion fees?

@_date: 2014-10-22 15:29:09
Looks fantastic. If you can add a mobile friendly version in future that would be even better. At the moment there isn't a very workable way to monitor addresses using an Android app, so a mobile website would be ideal.

Absolutely. He jumped the shark when he launched Maxcoin
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:28:34
It's not quite as simple as that and in fact seems to be damaging to the network if you aren't able to set it up correctly. Better just to install Electrum and use that as his wallet

Agreed. They do know their stuff so not sure why it came out so badly.

I can tell: you used "i'm" instead of "I'm" - Satoshi would never have done that. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 08:42:48
Yet again it's reported that bitcoins appeal to criminals because they "leave no financial trail". It's the opposite.

What's your comment?
@_date: 2014-11-21 10:12:33
We need to add a couple of new exchanges to that list but otherwise it's fairly complete.
It's missing [Mimex]( and [Yacuna](

What a freaky video that is.
@_date: 2014-10-07 11:49:58
Yeah he ends by saying that even the bitcoin faithful may move on to another way to transmit value but fails to mention there isn't a better way than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 09:32:13
Ah, thanks! I guess the wallet's name is spelled incorrectly then. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 22:15:08
I use bitcoin because I want it to succeed as a currency. Bitcoin is unprecedented. It is a marvel. But it will fail if we don't use it. 
In terms of trusting a card or provider, don't trust anyone apart from cold storage you've set up yourself. That said, if you want a web wallet blockchain.info seems a good bet.
Personally I have a small amount on my phone, most coins in cold storage generated by an offline computer, and a small amount in a verso card. I trusted verso over others because they did an AMA here a while back and seemed honest. 
Paying for something with BTC is very practical - the transaction goes through instantly. It's pretty cool when you first do it actually. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 06:26:41
Thanks. I went through most of the registration but wasn't happy to upload my ID. Following the MtGox debacle I'm not comfortable with sending my ID to sites to buy bitcoins any more. Otherwise it was looking good.

Should be cheaper than Circle when international conversion fees are taken into account. But Safello is probably still the cheapest option at the mo. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 15:50:34
This. Also the Blockchain app.
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:42:43
[Netagio]( can store your BTC insured and is reputable. Coinbase also has an [insured vault](
[Woodwallets]( can make you a cold storage wallet that looks good and uses a BIP38 encrypted private key so it doesn't matter that they know it. Ideally create the private key offline using [bitaddress](
Multi-sig is often cited round here so you may want to take a look at [GreenAddress](

Shame the best defence Jinyoung could offer was that he's "kind of old". offers a much more rational analysis of the situation - acknowledging the flaws while saying they can be worked on. Bitcoin isn't perfect and you can lose your money if you don't know what you're doing.
Didn't like all the negativity in the rest of the article, basically padding it out after Abagnale's comment.

Thanks Frank, I am indeed quite bummed about this. It's wrong. Good luck. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:03:13
It's a good piece but again makes the assumption that Bitcoin the currency can be divorced from bitcoin the protocol, when they are inextricably linked. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 11:02:27
This is a good article. Uses the "sensationalist" bit to draw people in then basically explains the recent history of bitcoin.

Using Circle or Coinbase you could buy BTC and send straight away to your friend's Canadian account on the same service. I don't know if either of them are able to be used in Canada, though, maybe someone else can confirm.
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:32:35
"Banks are concerned about the threat Bitcoin is to sterling" - damn straight. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 09:41:29
I think it's just because the tone of your post was a little triumphant, like "hey, banks are going to kill bitcoin using Facebook!"
@_date: 2015-01-07 13:38:40
There are many black people who believe the system has oppressed them for many years, and they're right. Bitcoin could be a way out for them as much as it is for everyone else, but they don't seem to have realised it yet as a group. And black people generally do regard themselves as a group, more than other racial groups I would say. Certainly more than white people.

Can you use Circle in the Netherlands? If so, that could be an easy option. Just make sure to transfer out as soon as it's sent to avoid fluctuations in value.

This. Make sure you sign up before you go - it'll make things a lot easier once you get there. If you're using blockchain, put in your blockchain wallet address under your account, take your phone with you when you go to the store, and you can see when the BTC are transferred. It may not be immediate but it was within a few mins for me.
As 5tu said, you may want to consider a different wallet though, there have been problems with blockchain. Mycelium on Android or Breadwallet on iOS.
@_date: 2015-01-29 12:17:13

He doesn't need to win votes, he's just done that a couple of months ago. I reckon this is the "extreme position" that they will have to pull back from.

Well he works for a gold company so he would say that.

Why aren't they on FDroid then?

This is fantastic. Donated.

Yes and he's been on the Keiser Report enough times to be exposed to bitcoin a lot over the past few years. I think gold bugs are saying these kind of things because bitcoin is replacing gold as the go-to asset class to hedge against financial crashes. And of course it's massively outperforming gold.

I really like the way you can see all your wallets in Mycelium under the main view. You can watch wallets that aren't yours and see them all in an overview. I know Samourai also have the Sentinel app but you can't see all the addresses in overview like Mycelium.
Also there is no support in Samourai for Ledger hardware wallets, which is a shame.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:34:58
YES, 1000x this.

I want to know this too.

It's difficult to find somewhere to spend bitcoin unless you know where you're going in advance. Mind you that's mostly the case worldwide. Wheretospendbitcoin.co.uk can help. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:17:40
thanks for the explanation. I'll look forward to seeing your new project. I just hope you haven't become a Mega Speaker.

CW's writing, over and above anything else, is the dead giveaway that he's not Satoshi. Satoshi had a unique style of writing that is actually quite difficult to reproduce - very balanced and calm, often explaining technical aspects of bitcoin to very well respected cryptographers with grace and patience. 
CW has none of that.

There's no way that's going viral, it's called Nerd Nite.

So this is the news Frank promised... interesting... could mean Safello will have a good "in" with one of the largest UK banks.
@_date: 2015-11-05 10:04:57
Coinbase is probably your best option. You can buy using a debit card. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:56:39
You could also try Coinfloor in the UK for a large amount like this. They will do an OTC trade for you I believe.

I remember that interview Kyle. I think he tried to defend her because she has been on the show. And to be fair to her, her pieces on the child abuse in Jersey have been excellent. Not sure how she managed to drop the ball so badly with the Dorian piece. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 19:54:24
Ahh this sounds like what happened. Thanks for posting. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 17:32:18
So will the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 09:17:13
These are my thoughts exactly. I actually think this has more to do with the envelope that was used than any tampering. But still, I'm going to flash the firmware just in case. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:06:56
Print two copies or photocopy it.
@_date: 2015-03-18 00:29:54
...among other subjects (scroll to the end for the bit on bitcoin).
@_date: 2017-05-08 20:28:09
OK so what wallets for Android and iOS are there that can vary the fee to this degree? Even Mycelium's lowest fee is still pretty expensive. And breadwallet is even worse. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 19:01:41
Its most likely just damage in the post, the packaging was pretty poor, just a regular envelope. The box was cracked and the envelope split open. But even if someone had accessed it, could they have tampered with it?
@_date: 2015-02-26 16:48:17
Another Matthew Sparkes special. He's just about the only mainstream journo following bitcoin in the UK.
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:25:05
He's either saying bitcoin is good because you can't "dilute" it like you could with gold or silver, or he saying in future maybe someone could put something "fake" ("lead") into bitcoin and say it is still bitcoin. In which case he doesn't understand bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-18 14:35:31
Betamax vs VHS is often mentioned when talking about why bitcoin could be superceded in the future. This is an interesting piece from 2003 about why VHS won because it presented consumers with "the whole product" not just technical superiority. 
Bitcoin also presents people with "the whole product".
@_date: 2015-02-25 17:29:10
Not keen on this "one bank" business.

Are these more secure than using a multi sig wallet like CoPay? 
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:34:13
Great answer, very informative. Thank you. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 09:58:36
I don't think so but the Ledger Unplugged can do this. You can also order a plain Fidesmo card and install the Ledger software on it. You can also use them as 2FA among other things.
