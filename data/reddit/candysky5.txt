Manipulation within a free unregulated market is one thing; manipulation within a tightly controlled regulated framework is quite another. Either way, they are going to manipulate it to their maximum capability. They have to. Because against an unbacked currency, allowing markets such as precious metals, oil, and bitcoin to reign freely is suicide for their entire fiat system.
But when this debt-backed fiat collapses on its own, that rubber ball at the bottom of the ocean will pop up to the surface, and catch a rocket-fueled booster to... dare I say it?

It doesn't calculate future performance per se; it profits from the fluctuations. If you get a buy signal, and then it goes down some more, you buy a little more. But the formula tells you exactly how much to buy or sell. You will profit from the signals in the short, medium, or long-term. Usually you will not have to wait long-term.

My ultra-profitable bitcoin math-based system is currently SCREAMING buy signals at me. It's an old mathematical formula that really works! If anyone would like to know EXACTLY how much you should buy right now, let me know how much you paid (you don't have to tell me the quantity; i'll give the answer per btc purchased). If you bought in at various timeframes, average it out to one figure.
If you bought in lower than the current price, I'll tell you how much you should SELL right now.
If you haven't bought ANY yet; BUY BUY BUY! But leave about 30-40% in fiat for later buying opportunities!
It's kinda a secret, because I'm refining it specifically for bitcoin.
It's just a really fun thing for me.

Having said that, it is always ok to add more to your portfolio if you wish. You can add, you can subtract; it's very flexible.
It's just not giving specific signals for you to do so right now.

Not that it negates your point, but, interestingly, IRS taxes gold as a "collectible", rather than subject to regular capital gains. As such, the tax is quite a bit higher. But yes, since IRS has deemed bitcoin to be property, you should legally be able to buy and sell it to your heart's content.

Why don't they target the crime and the criminal, rather than the method; a method which the other 99% of us should be able to conveniently use to conduct our everyday affairs without being anally probed every time we turn around?

“The Central Bank is an institution of the most deadly hostility existing against the principles and form of our constitution… if the American people allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all their property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.”

The problem is, though, that these financial institutions usually go way overboard, bending over backwards to appease the regulators. Because of course they want to keep them off their backs as much as possible, out of laziness and fear of liability, etc. When a line has been drawn that they must not cross, the institution will steer clear of anything even remotely close to that line.
When Lawsky assures that, "Don't worry; the regs don't pertain to THAT ", that's HIS interpretation. Coinbase and the rest will protectively give the regs a MUCH broader interpretation, to cover their asses and save a ton of work.
And don't think Lawsky and his ilk aren't damn well counting on this.

It's a purely technical system, nothing to do with fundamentals Fundamental thinking would clog the mechanism.

I remember seeing Max Kaiser on AJ's program when bitcoin was $5. Max said that if 2% of the population were to adopt bitcoin, it would be worth $500,000 to $750,000 each.

No, you just buy or sell a bit at a time, based upon the fluctuations. And I'm not selling anything.

10% fee is too high, 5% and you got a deal. Otherwise, LocalBitcoins is cheaper.

Just purchased 2 $100 WF gift cards from Gyft with btc. So easy and fun! Egifter doesn't sell WF cards. I'm hoping for Walgreens and Safeway.

Could you please average that out to one figure for me? I would need to know how many you bought at each price in order to average it out. But I don't want you to give that info here, too dangerous to let people know what you've got.
Please average it for me.

Sit on it for now. Lol. Until it moves one way or the other. 
It doesn't tell you, "Buy at $400, and sell at $600", for example. Rather, you calculate the formula at pre-determined time intervals; whether that be once a day, week, or month. It doesn't matter.

"Does it not seem strange to you that these men just happened to be CFR and just happened to be on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, that absolutley controls the money and interest rates of this great country without the benefit of Congress?  A privately owned organization, the Federal Reserve, which has absolutely nothing to do with the United States of America!

Total dollars spent, divided by number of coins purchased.

$447 for each bitcoin that you have already purchased. Of course, if you bought less than one whole bitcoin, just pro-rate it.
$447 X # of btc you own
Good luck!

Btw, long-term in bitcoinworld is a hella lot shorter than in stocks or precious metals, etc., as we all have learned.

It's not a double standard, because one side has much more validity than the other. There is no motivation for them to manipulate a market rise long-term.
