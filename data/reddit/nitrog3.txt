by being regulated i mean no bank or goverments involved. if you know a crypto that is not made by any goverment or bank that wants to be regulated by th goverment or bank please tell me so ;)

i think its over priced, theres much better coins now on the market with a much better system backing it, right now bitcoin is guna take lightning network and will partly be controlled by the banks in the end (hubs) great technology but it basicly kills the whole concept of bitcoin (decentralized) and as of right now like i said before theres much better coins right now that can addopt things much better then bitcoin, and they are much much much lower in price, just think of this why do you think alt coins  generaly rise more then bitcoin or any major alt coin? the major coins are oldfacioned @ proto types of a compleetly new world, you can see it as a old car of the 1900s, what do you think the comings years will provide? better better and better coins.. and yes bitcoin is the first real coin, it adds value, but remember ive seen many companies in the world dominating and fall, good example is how facebook took over all the other dominating social media's in the past. it will happen with bitcoin too if they do decide to impliment network lightning, and due the issues right now my opinion is bitcoin is over valued.

simple fact due capital needs, hubs will be banks in the end, i dont see any other party besides banks and goverment that can cover 10.000s of accounts + the banks and goverment want controll in the end anyway.

its pretty simple, just add a zero to it and if thats not enough you just add another, obviously that will be changed when the time is there for sure

its called news, everyone is responding to it, they sell storys like this to get vieuwers, thats the whole goal to them, i agree they dont care about us inviduals, but other then that i disagree, and just a question whos to tell its a bubble or not? 50+% correction is in trading markets a bubble, in crypto we need other terms for it but technicly its thesame drop, bubble or not.

by implimenting network ligntning?? technicly thats the end of bitcoin cuz it will centralize bitcoin, exacly the thing that bitcoin isnt made for, why do you think more and more people go into alt coins with a much better echnology behind it? blockchain is thesame security like bitcoin has, so why wouldnt alt be just as secure?? theres simply nothing that bitcoin has and other alts not have, ys 9 years of logs, but the curent area we are in is damaging bitcoin alot. centralizing it is bad people will put the hands from it including me

you are wrong, i have invested for over 15 years now. non the less if that is your opinion that is alright. perhaps i can advice you to search it up if you are so convinced ;)

i make option 4 futures will controll the price in the end, like what happend to gold an many other things that got futures applied, gold should be somuch more worth if there wasnt futures, btc will have thesame fate.

reconized, i totaly agree but they will never accept it, simply becuase theres tomuch money going into it but now that futures are released are people like mehh i dont need bitcoin i can buy a future instead with real dollars and it olds the price of bitcoin, why would i risk buying real bitcoin on traders that all are hacked atleast once and risk my fortune to it... just think about it a moment ;)
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:38:14
very true, but i think people will watch alot to the futures now and perhaps convice people to buy or sell actual bitcoin based on the price of futures, and when the future cap is somuch bigger in the future it end up futures regulating the price as each invidual bitcoin holder cannot impact it, its a very dificult story, but to make it short if theres somuch more money in futures people will look up to it and decide on the future price if they wanna buy or sell actual bitcoin
