One thing to add is that if you're talking about say 15,000 machines to run 
an attack, you'll probably need a really large datacenter to put them, 
racks, cabling, employees, etc. So the minimum cost is at least a bit

the big blue "Pay with Bitcoin" button on the BitPay invoice supports the 
bitcoin: URI scheme.  Your blockchain wallet can be configured to handle 
bitcoin: URI's so you can completely eliminate the need for copy and paste.﻿

These guys have no idea what they are talking about regarding Bitcoin. 
 They really need to learn more about the technology before they put money 
into it.  If you go into your own banking (which means providing your own 
security), you shouldn't do it without really learning a lot about what you 
are doing.  These guys displayed less understanding than my 9 year old 
cousin about bitcoin.  They are a danger to themselves if they invest in 
it...  Although I agree with them.  I absolutely would invest in bitcoin. 
 I would just learn a lot more before hand.   ﻿
