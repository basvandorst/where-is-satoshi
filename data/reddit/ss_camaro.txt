maybe. maybe it's a double-whammy. and maybe it's intentional too. the same sounds uttered from the posters here have been uttered by ponzi victims since the beginning of time.

What would the transaction fees have to rise to for it to be worth it to miners, sans the standard 50BTC, per 10mins?
@_date: 2011-06-17 06:02:57
The way I see it 'outlawing BTC' could have the following effects:
1. removes speculators from the capital pool  
2. eliminates vendors from accepting BTC as payments
3. stops growth of mining pools by limiting newcomers, while bigger pools will be targeted for disruption -- this could make the network less resilient against state-sponsored counterfeiting efforts which could lead to:
4. BTC goes the way of the Zimbabwe Dollar

the exchange is headed the way of the dodo bird.. bitcoins on the other hand.. still debating how the exchange mechanism will look like when the bigger exchanges and nodes get wacked.

so accurate, it's scary:


think about the socio-political implications of a deflationary currency.. the current system would blow up hard. civil war and world war would be the likely outcome, followed by a brentwood agreement.

I lol'ed. Though it was [Turing]( that cracked Enigma. If the big govs declare war on cryptocurrency, things will get interesting. It'd definitely put a new spin on the meaning of 'economic warfare'.

50BTC could be worth $50,000 in the future... I see the need for a miner's association or formula that can calculate purchasing parity and volume on a daily basis.

If the ranks are thinned out enough, what are the chances of an entity gaining control of over half of the network processing capacity?

Anonymous exchanges could work, but what about the miners? They could be targeted as well.

I wonder about Garzik's right mind. If the exchanges will be targeted then it is important to increase the efficiency of decentralized exchange mechanisms.
