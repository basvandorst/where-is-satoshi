Look at it from a layperson's perspective: Enron kept going for years before it went bankrupt. Bernie Madoff's scam kept going for at least 20 years, maybe even more.
Imagine you shorted Enron stock in late 1999 in the high $30s. By the mid 2000s, it went up to $80. Doesn't matter it would crash a year later, if you get margin called.

I mean, even if it is a scam, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

I'm not comparing them. I don't believe bitcoin to be a scam.
I'm merely providing a justification for the average layperson (who does not want to do their own research) who _does_ believe it to be a scam to not want to go all in on shorting bitcoin. They hear about all these scams that _did_ go up in value for years before they go bust. To them, bitcoin might be the same, and people are generally risk averse.

It's been required by law to use ActiveX for financial transactions for a very long time. I don't know if that still stands true, but my mom still has to use IE for her banking needs, and if you have a mac, forget about it

Does that actually work? I would think you don't actually have access to the money until it's cleared by a person.
