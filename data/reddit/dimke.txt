Try to reflash with different firmware version.  Also try to swap control board with good one to see if hashing boards are causing the issue.

@_date: 2018-09-29 17:37:01
Great news, could you please put location for the ATM I think many people would like to know location.
@_date: 2018-09-29 18:21:50
Thank you ��
@_date: 2015-12-08 18:23:33

@_date: 2015-12-20 18:53:21
Slush pool is working nice,  also kano. is is pretty good one too.  Please do not mine at Chinese pools...
@_date: 2015-12-31 11:29:50
Sweet :)  numbers are getting ridiculous
@_date: 2015-12-08 11:46:44
also works fine for me,  are you verified?
@_date: 2015-12-08 12:51:11
verified means that you provided data for kyc/aml like your government issued id,  passport, bill with your name etc
@_date: 2016-03-18 09:34:44
Great mobile wallet using it for a while.  Also why not sponsor whole esports team not just CS GO for example cloud9 or team liquid they both compete in several games. I think League of Legends teams are more popular these days.  My few satoshis...

Great artist,  excellent music downloaded and donated!
@_date: 2016-03-26 08:52:04
Yes it is excellent song,  Gramatik is really gifted artist and his music is different. It is good to have song name with Satoshi`s name
@_date: 2016-03-20 21:11:26
I use them for a while evrything works perfect, they charge blockchain fee when converting to fiat and around $0.5 for using card itself. Very satisfied with them so far.
@_date: 2016-03-06 10:50:07
You made my day! In my case could not agree more.
@_date: 2016-06-25 09:18:51
In about 3 weeks :D
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:38:22
also tried now works perfect. good job! just to clarify you get codes for classic packs. again great job guys from joltfun
@_date: 2016-11-25 15:51:13
also try with older version of electrum
@_date: 2019-06-02 09:38:49
Good idea... btw he is really wacky and interesting musician
@_date: 2019-02-23 10:25:14
Yes buy asap!
@_date: 2015-08-07 20:24:51
Yup 100% scam. I was surprised when I saw that article and after a couple of seconds I noticed that url is not coindesk offical same with bitmain voucher page. Stay away! Also always check offical web site and if they have SSL cert most of them do.
@_date: 2015-08-07 18:07:15
Ahahaah this is a good one. I will use this when explaining bitcoin to some newbie :)
@_date: 2015-08-01 09:44:26
And the train has left the station. Buckle up!
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:06:55
Dumplings? :D
@_date: 2015-08-20 21:15:04
I check many of them regulary but this one is most usefull [data.bitcoinity.org](
@_date: 2015-08-07 20:32:55
Electrum is great for begginers. You should follow instructions and write down your seed. After that play with it try what can and can`t do. If you really want web wallet try Bitgo or Greenaddress

I am not sure for price in Serbia... it is 0.1 USD per kWh
@_date: 2015-08-23 21:49:50
Interesting recently I found Mojo Nation and there is nice video from old Defcon with McCoy. There are some concepts that are in btc...
@_date: 2015-08-29 15:19:34
@_date: 2015-08-07 20:23:05
It is not? Well I did not know that. Also there is ANX, Bit-X I forgot someone for sure but those are the ones that are proven to be ok. I have used ANX a lot and when e-coin appeared I switched to them. Are you 100% sure that they not provide their service to US customers. I have USD card from them...
@_date: 2015-08-05 08:25:55
Many people burned themselves with preorders and such. So do a decent research about company who you buying from...
@_date: 2015-08-17 09:37:35
I droped a tear. This is best thing that I have read here for a while. I agree 100% with you. Keep up the good work devs!
@_date: 2015-07-30 20:02:39
That is not enough :) If he will do that with hands tied behind his back then ok :)
@_date: 2015-08-29 20:22:52
Start from here:
You will need some knowledge of applications and installing drivers. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 21:58:20
Try to type bitcoin in edge to see how pretty it is :)
@_date: 2015-07-28 15:13:35
I checked where app landed by default and it is in /opt folder
@_date: 2015-07-31 09:20:29
I think there is need for larger block size, but we need to consider all parameters like global bandwidth, cost of hdd space etc. For start it would be good to pump up block size to 2MB and after that we will see what happens. 
@_date: 2015-07-28 15:40:28
Your welcome
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:46:37
Great job! I would like something like that in my house :)
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:54:27
e-coin.io maybe not the cheapest but definetly most convinient and easy to use
@_date: 2016-02-09 12:59:52
Sweeeeeeeet! This is so amazing! Great job BitPay!
@_date: 2015-08-25 19:52:38
Very nice. Will look into it more.
@_date: 2015-08-11 18:51:33
You are brave :) I would not enter that library any time soon after this photo :)
@_date: 2015-07-28 09:02:48
I am on Ubuntu 15.04, starting app is east I just open dash and start typing Coinffeine icon appears, click, done.
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:56:12
Well at the end he will get what he deserves. There is plenty of evidence so this is not surprising at all. If he get ruled guilty on all charges what are the consequences?
@_date: 2017-04-18 14:27:17
great thread, using wirex for a long time but thinking about other providers we need more data and how fast are other services to wirex?
@_date: 2016-02-09 17:12:48
Great news cant wait to see final version. Keep up the good work Thomas!
@_date: 2015-09-25 15:38:22
Really nice effort by your club, you can check bitmaintech from time to time as they are preparing new batches constantly. Also if you are in a rush then check out marketplace/goods/computer goods on btctalk forum and only buy from trusted old members with escrow and you should be fine.
@_date: 2015-09-26 13:12:58
you can buy stickers really cheap on bitstickers.net :)
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:51:47
First and last point hit the spot! Exchanges are easy to DDOS and your funds could stuck or gone missing in no time ;) If you are a buyer, buy your BTC and get it out to wallet where only you hold private key!
@_date: 2015-11-07 14:17:02
Have you tried to withdraw amount that is not exceeding your tier limit?
@_date: 2015-10-04 17:17:40
e-coin.io works great!
@_date: 2016-05-03 10:21:13
Clap clap
@_date: 2015-10-30 10:19:01
@_date: 2015-10-21 13:57:52
Interesting, I tried to withdraw small amount of BTC &lt;1 and it went fast almost instantly, then I tried with UNO and that went fast also. I have verified user account. It seems that delay in withdrawal is just for large amounts of BTC...
@_date: 2015-10-23 10:45:46
Check out  there is a couple of ATM in Australia.
@_date: 2015-10-03 19:28:19
It is working now, for me at least...
@_date: 2015-10-26 22:40:45
yup two different quotes fix that guys. thx
