I like the Airbitz business directory as it also comes with a wallet.  When one spends from the wallet and records the transaction the merchants in the directory are auto filled as payee in the transaction detail.  Neato!!

Great to see a wallet that incorporates such good security while remaining easy to use.

Well, if OP is looking for a user's suggestion, wouldn't it be best to come from someone who is also a developer aw well?

I think all the wallets mentioned are good.  For beginners however, Airbitz strips out the unfamiliar public key and lets you name your wallet.  Airbitz also has advanced features that then may be accessed by the user as their bitcoin knowledge advances.

Great job Paul.  You are right the news still wants to sell fear so they ended the story with the obligatory "bitcoin is v e r y vol... ital" meme.  Thank you for your efforts to get bitcoin on the San Diego map.

Seeing that some big wallets have been hit by random number generated bugs, and have sustained losses; good to see the proactive nature of the Airbitz Wallet team in staying current and securing their wallet.  Cudos!

Great stuff, a directory that has real listings, I am excited

Per Paul Puey - Yes, buy and sell from exchanges with the KYC and AML done directly by the exchange.  KYC and AML WILL NOT be done by Airbitz or be part of the Airbitz wallet which will remain private.

Good steps that should be incorporated by all bitcoin users!

In San Diego and elsewhere for that matter, make sure to check the Airbitz Business Directory conveniently paired with a BTC Wallet for local eateries accepting BTC.

I have a large balance on my Airbitz wallet and completely trust it.  I have downloaded my private keys and wella I have a complete system of spending and storage.  
@_date: 2015-04-04 14:26:51
Agreed.  Excellent easy to use wallet. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 21:56:26
The Airbitz wallet is great to use.  Easy, great user interface, records all transactions, that way your tax man knows what to deduct at tax time, and they are constantly coming out with new features, such as Bluetooth Send/Receive (they of course have QR code but Bluetooth is some much more fun).  Give it try!

Its tax time and the Airbitz wallet with transnational detail has made my life way easier!!
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:38:04
The Aribtz wallet, has it all.  Secure and encrypted, Bluetooth Payment via iOS (skip the QR code if you want), excellent transaction detail screen, downloadable to CSV.  Super good looking and easy to use, overall a very good wallet and its free...not sure how they can do that as they do not share user info, as a matter of fact, you give no info to them!, with anyone.  Enjoy.

Totally awesome, no more using GA and cutting pasting to ensure 2FA.  This is a huge step forward for my inner geek!
@_date: 2015-02-10 19:20:30
Good to see Bitcoin be used and understood.  Great way to spread the message.  
@_date: 2015-02-17 21:55:37
Sweet!  No more messy QR codes 
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:06:40
Truly awesome!  Another first by the Airbitz team.  Congrats!
