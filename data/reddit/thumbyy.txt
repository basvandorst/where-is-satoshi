No, like literally hiding their cash in their couch or something instead of storing it at a bank. If the money is all hoarded, it may increase in value so long as no new money enters the economy. But once again, the economy will fail to grow as the money is stored doing nothing, rather than being invested.
Bank runs happen due to uncertainty in the economy or housing bank. Let’s say our currency is now Bitcoin, a day like today happens where it’s value drops sharply. People aren’t confident in bitcoin maintaining its value so they start selling en masse, eventually causing bitcoin to fail. That would function pretty similar to a bank run.
Without fractional reserve interest rates would skyrocket due to the massively increased cost of capital for the banks. With higher interest rates, the chances of default become higher, further hiking interest rates and reducing the banks’ willingness to lend. Because of this, only the most creditworthy debt holders would be approved for loans, and with no new (fractional reserve) money entering the economy, growth would stagnate and the economy would fall into depression.

I’m very familiar with how banking works. Instead let’s travel back to 1792, abolish fiat currency, and see where society has advanced to in the present day based on the barter system.

Your economy would be stunted without fractional reserve, and susceptible to money hoarding/bank runs/economic depressions without quantitative easing.

I can appreciate someone who’s self-aware enough to acknowledge they don’t know everything. Kudos to you. Parts of it aren’t good (bank/government bailouts), but I personally think it’s a system that functions pretty well, all things considered. I’m not sure where crypto fits into that system right now, and who knows if it will have any impact on changing that system.

You are actually clueless man... do you know the history of how/why “fiat” currency came to be in the first place?
