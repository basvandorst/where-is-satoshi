Yeah it's very solvable.  So far each puzzle has been solved in less than two hours from release.  The next puzzle will be released tonight.  It's kinda generous.

Yeah you gotta use a computer.  It's a steam game so you need that first.
The game's started and $15 of bitcoin has been claimed but the next round of puzzles will be unlocked in about 10 hours \- 6pm PDT.

Give the rest of us a chance!

Why is that?  You want the chance of a jackpot?  I like this way better, since you have a better chance of winning a prize, even though it might only be $300.  You actually have a really good chance since not too many people are playing.

The data says the source is [ which stopped reporting detailed numbers Nov 2017.  So, they probably scraped the website where it says "stats: users: 20M".  Self-reported coinbase numbers.

My guess is 0.39356 BTC
