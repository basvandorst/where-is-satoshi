You dodged the question. Should BCH have more code written for it, and still relevant as a crypto, would you accept it as true bitcoin?

I would hesitate buying into the "hostile takeover" narrative. You seem well informed, so I assume you are aware of, well let's call it moderation environment here, that lead to creation of The thing with outcasting a portion of a community that vocally disagrees with current way of thinking is that those people will find a new forum of discussion and start their own community, outside of reach of the original. Then all the non-vocal people who agreed with their stance will follow. 
In my understanding, Cash started as a proof-of-concept while the compromise between both parties was on the table (X2) but once it failed, Cash was seen as the official implementation for the big block community. This is also the moment things shifted rapidly to favor Cash on some of the platforms you mentioned. 
Since these people are the same people who created (or supported) Cash as their endgame after being excluded from discussion about original Bitcoin, it's only logical they keep using the same discussion forums (as they used to. I agree, strongly pushing for Cash related narrative on originally BTC exclusive channels is sketchy, but that should have been obvious from mile away. However, said channels still discuss and promote BTC as well, though there is the portion of people that have hateful attitude towards it.
What people here present as purposeful misleading, other side views as education about alternative options to people interested in the subject of crypto.
About  I truly have no idea. Hacking, buying the account or such are possible.  I just know about and Bitcoin.com and why they support Cash.
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:42:42
So, if we reach a point where Cash has more work done, would you be willing to accept Core/Legacy chain as an altcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:07:14
I'm not aware of any kind of moderation intervention to posts against Cash on Obviously there were posts but unless you are talking about downvoting then I'm not sure what you would mean by "squashed". If you are talking about downvoting, then you see democracy take its purest form and majority obviously wanted to discuss BCH.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:24:13
Untrue. was created as a lightly moderated forum for big blockers, many who are banned from here. That community **is** the Cash community.
Adoption of Cash is direct answer to refusal of going through with X2 and it was generally viewed as "last chance for Bitcoin core" by these people,
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:33:14
As someone who has been holding for years but lacks the technical expertise to evaluate different views in coding (blocksize debate, for example) and as someone who is currently holding both due to receiving bch and wanting to se things through,  while holding a neutral stance, there's some things that bother me about the debate. 
Correct me if I'm wrong somewhere but the main and basically only effective difference in bch and btc is blocksize and ascii boost thing? So where does this argument raise that cash does not have a right to Bitcoin name, taken it's mostly identical? I understand the frustration it causes but in my eyes both forks share equal right due to identical code base. 
In the end of the day, survival of original Bitcoin is necessary for all crypto because it's *the crypto* in eyes of the general public. I also despise the hostile view many bch fans hold towards original Bitcoin so I'm by no means a "bch troll". I do, however feel like the debate currently is too emotionally charged on both sides and the fracturing of such a big portion of the community is a failure in original Bitcoin developement.

But other companies lack ability to create credit to invest from nothing, even if its operatively from central banks. Devaluation takes effect only when the money hits corporate level of economy. So banks are winning, corporations are neutral and normal people are losing.

@_date: 2016-11-28 10:10:45
Ehm, youre simply disregarding the fundamental difference between drugs and btc, which breaks your entire hypothesis. **Drugs are consumed, btc stays in circulation.** Drug prices originate from high risk transportation, btc price originates from size of the infrastructure and usability. 
If the drug user base gets smaller, prices increase due to volume dropping but risk staying the same = unit price increases. However, if btc user base gets smaller, the ways to spend that btc decrease, inherently dropping the unit price significantly. Investors would also drop out, cutting out ~50% of value, leaving us at around $300/btc due to dark net.
@_date: 2016-12-02 15:49:14
Ehm, the *actual* real life use for bitcoin is still limited to dark net drug market. Even if you *can* use it for other means, it's hardly a reason for anyone to get bitcoin who doesn't already. Hence "nothing has happened". A non-bubble value is based on actual use value of a commodity, and currently the use value of bitcoin is the darknet trade. Ignoring realism in this sense is idiotic.
@_date: 2016-11-28 18:00:30
Yes, but HODLing is still a "use" for BTC in terms of investment. We can kid ourselves all we want, but the fact is that currently a huge majority of the unit price comes from people investing into btc in hopes of making money. It's a bit of a fluke value, obviously. Then a "foundation" of the value (which I'd say is the $250 mark) comes from the darknet, which is "real life usability". If West starts to ban bitcoin, just about all of the value upwards from the "foundation" will disappear and we would stabilize at the $250. Before you argue, no, the other uses for bitcoin really aren't a meaningful source of value for the overall ecosystem. Dark net drug trade is *the shit* when talking about actually using btc as a currency.
India is also quite a poor example, since limiting *local* supply is entirely different than attacking *entire ecosystem* by global scale illegality.
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:58:40
$20,000? More like $20M should that actually happen.
@_date: 2016-12-28 19:07:25
If price would be $1000, Id say 20% would be darknet, 79% would be speculation and 1% would be normal usage. Basically if darknet trade somehow disappeared (global large scale drugs decriminalization), btc would die in terms of monetary value. At least temporarily.
Anyone who disagrees is delusonal, really. What future holds, nobody knows, but this is the case now. I honestly think the most change btc can do to the world, realistically, is to empower (in money worth) enough young liberal nerds that we can take over part of economics and shift focus towards more humanitarian and green business.
@_date: 2016-12-03 17:26:03


In terms of bitcoin, which is impossible to create value in itself and only as a means of transaction, the value comes from it's use a a transaction method. That is, in practice, only happening in dark net where it's the only method of transaction. You can't actually be this stupid can you?


How on earth can you "disagree" with defined terminology? That's fucking retarded.


Holding doesn't create any value, bubble or otherwise. You're simply disconnecting yourself from the trade, being a no-factor. The evidence is literally the bitcoin price history. It's entirely tied to the usefulness of BTC as a currency, apart from the bubbles or speculative fluctuation. The only *actual* use for bitcoin is dark net trade, and when the speculative value plummeted after the MT.Gox incident, we were down to around $250 practically all of 2015. Since then, we've had a bubble starting to form as*literally nothing has changed* in terms of the big picture to support the growth. More and more stores accept bitcoin but exactly nobody has any reason to purchase it outside of a) buying drugs b) speculation (bubble) c) niche reasons like sending money to areas where wire transfer is inconvenient d) avoiding money transfer laws like China. Whenever the speculative bubble dies, and if we ignore the niche uses, we're left with exactly only illegal uses for bitcoin.


Gold has literally zero value in usefulness as money. Nobody uses gold as money.


"Gold jewellery demand was worth US$89 billion in 2015, and accounted for over half of global demand for gold.
Rooted deeply in a diverse tapestry of cultural traditions the aspiration to own and give gold in the form of jewellery transcends generations and national boundaries. The three largest markets for gold jewellery, China, India, and the US, each accord it a unique cultural significance. Acquiring jewellery is connected to celebrations, relationships, self-expression, and hopes for the future in these countries"

What about the massive jewelry industry..? And Electronics industry?
It's very simple. Bitcoin has 2 actual uses I can recommend it to anyone with, speculation investment (a bubble) and buying drugs online. Gold has one one use for a common person, investment, but the value is stable because of the supply and demand being constant due to jewelry industry using it as a primary material.
When the investment interest disappeared from bitcoin, we dropped to the "real value" - the value held up by dark net trade infrastructure. Basically, anything above that ($250) is a bubble, until something else comes around to give BTC a real purpose (outside ideological usage and speculation investments). That may be large scale businesses creating transaction systems based on blockchain or some killer app appearing that makes BTC so easy and convenient and offers something so good that a new wave of actual people actually *using* bitcoin appear, or whatever. I lack a crystal ball, but the fact remains that until that whatever happens, any rise in value is basically a bubble, by definition ( 
That said, I'm personally very positive about bitcoin and I've been HODLing for a few years. I just like to be realistic about the situation.
@_date: 2016-12-02 19:03:54
Umm, definition of "economic bubble" is literally ["price that strongly deviates from the corresponding asset's intrinsic value"]( which basically is all of btcs value outside drug trade.
Speculative value equals a bubble. We will never drop to zero as long as people actively use btc for dark net trade.
@_date: 2016-11-09 12:27:04
Im not sure how *legalizing* drugs can *grow* BTC since a huge pillar in the factual value is the darknet trade.

Ehm, even a slow bubble is a bubble. Literally nothing has happened in the real world to warrant price increase outside investment value, which by definition is a bubble.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:50:22
What you believe is entirely irrelevant and you cant argue by dismissing terminology other people use. Its the cornerstone of communication that we can use certain terminology, and as such bitcoins value is mostly a "bubble". Should the speculative value of btc disappear, we would drop down to $250 which is upheld by the dark net trade.
Golds value has always been driven by the fact that its consumed by different industries and the supply is limited. Its simply ignorant to think that golds value would be only speculative when you can view the outcome of gold industry every time you go to a shopping center.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:54:59

Honestly, if you were any way educated about basics of Bitcoin and understood the hypothetical possibilities, you didn't think 10k was "insane". I bought in roughly 6 years ago and fully expected it to reach 10k and wishful thinking was 100k - 1m sector

For everyone replying here things such as "Bank can't decide where you use your money" or similar:
You DO NOT own the money on your bank account. You have legally lended bank the money, and the accounts saldo equals the amount of money the bank owes you. This means, you are actually using money you do not own, and they are allowed to tell you what not to do with it.
