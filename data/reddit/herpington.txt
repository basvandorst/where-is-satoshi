It actually isn't. If anything, you have *slightly* less options with 2 million than you do with 200k, but those are so exotic as to be insignificant.

US stocks have averaged 10% nominal and 7% real returns for the past 90 or so years. That's before factoring in fees and taxes.
Additionally, with a 100% stock portfolio, you're most likely going to see drawdowns in excess of 50% at least once in your lifetime. What are you going to do then?
Investors as a group suffer from amnesia and forget the history of markets.
I'm a major advocate of investing in stocks, but people need realistic expectations.

I'm honestly not sure what argument you're trying to make.
Whether you had invested 200k or 2 million into VFINX, you would have obtained the same return over the past 5 years. That is, a 15.64% CAGR. That's far above the historical average because we're been in a strong bull market since the bottom in 2009.
If we look back 15 years, the 2002-2017 period (excluding the few days that are still missing in 2017, of course) ended up landing fairly close to the long term historical average at a 9.69% CAGR.
My comment on there existing different opportunities for 200k vs. 2 million had to do with for example investing in tiny illiquid nano cap stocks. Although for most practical intents and purposes those are exotic enough to not matter in the grand scheme of things.
EDIT: My original beef with your "8-13" comment was that you're not going to be able to eat those returns in the long run since you're ignoring inflation and taxes. Even a 4% inflation-adjusted withdrawal rate is not always sustainable indefinitely due to sequence of return risk.
EDIT2: Fixed 1992 to 2002.
