Hello everyone! This is my first post, and just moving over to reddit to try and spread awareness for my designs and clothing! Crypto is accepted and really hoping I can have the community show me the ropes ❤️ I’ve linked the site! Looking forward to messages to learn from the experts ��

Got a similar design on my site if anyone would like it as a phone case, it’s a black and white version! Great minds think alike!!
