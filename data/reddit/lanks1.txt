The U.S. dollar is valuable because it facilitates trillions and trillions of dollars in economic activity. 
Bitcoin facilitates the sale of hits of blotter acid and as a 'screw you' type currency for anarcho-capitalists. These transactions are worth a few million dollars apparently, so that's where the value should be.

That will never ever happen.

The housing sector crash was a complex crash was a result of a combination of factors including: government subsidization of housing loans, unscrupulous mortgage lenders, credit-hungry consumers, ratings agency incompetence and good old fashioned irrational exuberance. 
Futures contracts are available in thousands of other commodities that don't suffer from boom/busts.

No, Canada was filled with hundreds of thousands of native people and some squabbling Brits and French in a proxy fight over territory related to the 7 years war. 
Canada also has people and resources - assets in the creation of goods and services. 
Bitcoin's only value is in the possible, although increasingly unlikely, use to lower transaction fees and to make selling hits of blotter acid over the internet possible.

Don't worry there will be a dead cat bounce before the real sell-off.

I can 100% guarantee that not in this universe or the next one or the one's parallel to this one will Bitcoin ever come close to replacing multiple existing currencies. 
It definitely has a niche, but it's not that big of a deal.

There is a zero percent chance that bitcoin will ever hit that level. This would value all 21 million bitcoins at 2 trillion dollars. 
This is complete and utter nonsense.
