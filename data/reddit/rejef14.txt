Yeah but the nature of my business and the things they purchase are all digital.  It's a website and users will be purchasing monthly memberships and points.  Once they get either it can't just be refunded.  I mean people could buy millions of points, give them out or use them then get a charge back, screwing my entire website and monetary system.
And honestly people don't have to use my website.

I'm actually having a problem finding other methods of accepting payments from around the world that are available to the entire world. I've found worldPay and a few others.  Paypal won't allow me to use them since my site accepts bitcoin.

Well the other options cost quite a bit of money for each transaction too, it costs even more with higher volume, plus it can take several days to get your money.
I am just thinking, why wouldn't someone use something like coinbase to purchase bitcoin then transfer it to my business?  It's just as safe, they can purchase it with the same methods.

Plus I've owned different businesses all my life. I know how humans work.  They love to use a credit card to get something then make a claim and get a charge back.  I've dealt with it many times.

It seems thought that almost anyone can find a way to get bitcoin.

The only other thing, since I can't use paypal that i have found is WorldPay, and about as many people have heard of that as Bitcoin.

Oh also a little while after the site is up, I'll be allowing users to make money using the website, which payouts will be in bitcoin.  So It's kind of important to get my users into the Bitcoin world from day 1.

No have not launched the site yet. I've owned businesses all my life.  However automating withdrawal of a membership upon a charge back is nearly impossible.  There is no way to tie the user to the charge in an API that I have found.  Plus if they purchased points then used them or gave them away there would be no way to recoup the points, so my system could be flooded with points by users who purchase points then charge back.
I mean users will be purchasing Bitcoin with the same methods they would purchase through other methods, so really Coinbase would just be a middle man for payments.

Oh and those other methods like Paypal won't let you use them if you accept other methods and charge less for the other methods than for using PayPal.
And right now Paypal won't let me use their service, which leaves just a few options.  People can use the same methods to purchase bitcoin.
I am thinking it may take a little time for people to open up to bitcoin more or just use it as a way to quickly pay for things.
More and more places are accepting it.
