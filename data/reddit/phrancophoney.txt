Can't stop laughing? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:02:32
No rush, Amigo.  Staying chill will help you make sound decisions.  It's only $50.  Perspective.
Why did you buy $50 of BTC in the first place...???  Have you considered just leaving there as a long-term investment?  5 years?  10 years?  Do you NEED this right now...???
Did you consider simply leaving it there, and then sending it to your own personal TREZOR hardware wallet for safe keeping???  Long term???
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:59:58
Majority of us are here to hold long term, hence the lack of discussion about the skyrocketing price.  What-the-actual-fuck do you want ANYONE to do about this?  You're overstating the obvious, Amigo.  How much bitcoin do you hold???

@_date: 2017-12-05 11:47:09
Set-up an account with QuadrigaCX.
Send your bitcoin to your QuadrigaCX wallet.
Start with small amounts if you'd like to practice and be comfortable with the processes.  
As a Canadian, I've done it many times now since September.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:25:48

You decided to buy "bitcoins" to see if you'd make money, but you don't know how that would happen?
Is this real life...???

"The biggest threats to Bitcoin. I think, Bitcoin isn't just a technology, it's also a community. And, actually probably one of the most effective ways of attacking that community is by spreading disinformation, creating dissent, and [creating] arguments and drama within the Bitcoin community. And I would be very surprised if Bitcoin is the first community—that is an activist grassroots community—that is not fully fully infiltrated by a whole bunch of intelligence services, and corporate spies, and bullshit artists who are trying to cause problems. Why? Because historically we know that every single grassroots activist movement: the environmentalists, the feminists, the anti-war activists—all of them—the communists, the labor unions, have been infiltrated, have been filled with propaganda, have had active agents creating drama. Reddit, I'm talking about you.
So, my advice is: focus on the technology, the technology is real. The drama isn't real, it's completely fake. Some of it is just idiots. Some of it is paid people who are doing this as a job. And I try to pay as little attention to the drama as possible. That's one of the risks for Bitcoin. Fragmentation of the community slows things down. If the brightest programmers we have are spending all day dealing with trolls on Reddit, they're not writing code. Right? And that's a danger for our system." —Andreas Antonopoulos

I kinda cringed when I saw that, too.
I bought my TREZOR on Amazon and the box itself was glued in such a way that it had to be basically ripped apart, and it was also double-sealed with holographic foil seals.

Well, I think that-that is fantastic, Amigo.  
You've been fortunate, and you've made some wise decisions along the way.  You deserve to be congratulated.  
I've been watching BTC since the early days, like yourself, except I did not go through the "Technological Deep Dive" that it took to purchase for fear of messing things up royally.
This Autumn, during "The China Dip", I finally got in and purchased BTC, LTC, and Etherium.  
I like to take the time to fuss over "Lining My Ducks Up In A Row" and I enjoy investing (mostly through my RRSP account for retirement) but BTC And LTC and Etherium now have my full attention.  My goal is to have 1-whole Bitcoin before things get too out-of-control in the pricing department, and also while it's still attainable to buy 1-while Bitcoin for the average Joe, such as myself.
I enjoyed your backstory and was just telling the wife about it.  It's encouraging...so, thank you :)

I don't see why you're comparing Bitcoin to U.S. Dollars in terms of long-term value.  U.S. Dollars are printed-off at the rate of $36.5 million by the Federal Reserve DAILY.  
Bitcoin circulation will end at 21 million coins.  
Your theoretical presentation above is not only skewed, it's misleading.

So sorry.

They DO...???
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:50:13
This is terrible and incredibly flippant of them.  Also, this is not the first time that I've read of negative accounts of people and their dealings with Kraken.  
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:04:38
...and there is that bitcoin-arrogance everyone talks about.  sucks, man.
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:06:08
I like how you stick **TO** your guns.
EDIT:  Forgot a word.
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:29:17
The fuck are you going on about?  Did I say Coinbase was an exchange??
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:14:24
What are we looking at here...?
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:32:35


I am enjoying your story and this thread, so thanks for sharing.  Seriously.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:20:56


Fucking seriously?
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:49:43
Keep waiting.  Fork ain't happend yet.
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:55:02
Unbelievable, really.
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:31:31
You're missing the point.
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:48:44
Ya, but they could have been "Influenced", if you know what I mean.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:05:15
Take a break, man.  Go outside or something.

Canadian here.  Have been buying Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Etherium for a few weeks now.  
I have a Coinbase account, and a QuadrigaCX (Canadian) account.
I purchase with both.  With Coinbase, it's done quickly with a credit card, after the instant purchase is done, I transfer it to my QuadrigaCX account here in Canada.  
QuadrigaCX allows us Canadians to SELL our cryptocurrency, as Coinbase does not support that.  That is why I have that account.  You can buy, and sell, with QuadrigaCX.  
Ask more questions if you like.  I've looked at this from many angles lately.  I've also been in touch with their support representatives at QuadrigaCX via email.  So far, so good with them.  I won't leave my cryptocurrency with them for much longer, though, as I've received a Trezor in the past week to prep for the upcoming hardfork.
EDIT:  QuadrigaCX purchases on my part were via Interac through RBC.  I had them raise my purchase limits.

Sure.  They can pay me in BTC while they're at it.
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:17:50
this.  scammy bastards.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:35:51
I know.

@_date: 2017-10-14 20:21:23
I seriously wish that he wouldn't do this.  
Bitcoin community does NOT need the bullseye on it.
EDIT:  You guys are missing the point.  Do you enjoy stepping on hornet's nests...???  Stay the fuck under the radar.  Be cool.  
Assange is asking for trouble, and WE'RE the ones who will pay.   
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:23:44
Bingo.  Big difference here.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:41:40
He might IF everyone else is already on board and it's being used globally as easily as cash is right now.  Maybe-so.  We'll know in the end.  20 years from now, maybe...???  
I think that this man's point here (in the article) is that this thing (BTC) is fully "Off Of The Ground" now.

I am Canadian.  QuadrigaCX to buy AND sell.
