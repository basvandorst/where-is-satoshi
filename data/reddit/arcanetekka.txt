Bitcoin does do quite a few things that fiat isn't able to. It is trustless, so you are not exposed to counterparty risk. It is decentralised, borderless and censorship resistant, meaning you are not subject to government's monetary policy. Look at Greece as a place where citizens were screwed by the government when the economy faulted. It is inherently deflationary and can be used to store value, something that is important in an environment with hyper-inflation, see: Venezuela or Zimbabwe. I think fiat is important and it's not going anywhere, but there is definitely value in crypto - how much valuation it should have I think is the question.

Love how Crypto Daily is the only one that pokes fun at that

How did you do the exchange? I've only ever traded fiat for btc on an actual exchange. I don't think I'd trust sending btc to a rando unless he gave me cash in hand first.

You have to convert to fiat and pay capital gains at some point if you want to spend your profit though right?

Andreas is great and I love his presentations, but the quotes provided don't give me any more confidence in BTC. This is really talking about blockchain in general. If the currency is rebooted, we hodlers are left in the dust. I'm sure the Bitcoin protocol can continue to adapt and thrive, but would be worried if it fails as a network and everybody jumps ship.

I thought LTC still has ASICs mining?

Sure, I guess its all about levels, I didnt think ASIC-resistance was a core design principle of LTC, unlike Vertcoin for example. Or Monero which switched to CNv7.

The floor probably sits around $1000 since that's the rough cost to mine  a coin and price memory is still high

Haven't had a Boost in a long time, but could just be a bad franchisee making their staff cut corners to save a bit of money. Don't remember it being so bad when I was last there
