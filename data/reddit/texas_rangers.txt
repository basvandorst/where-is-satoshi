Same. Robinhood has always been on the leading edge of coming up with ways I can lose money.

I just want to say don't ever let ANYONE alter your mind when they're not presenting sound arguments behind it. Bitcoin actually was a genius asset to buy, and may still be. It's all about timing. 
So you are ultimately right, as an outsider who doesn't own bitcoin, and you are the one who made the right call in buying BTC.

Ok fair enough. I’m not coming in here to disprove bitcoin, that’s dumb, I’m legit curious because I’ve seen this pattern more than once. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 01:09:07
Parabolic patterns are a recognizable pattern. The end result isn’t always the same long term, but it’s certainly a thing. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 04:59:49
no thats just completely not right. High volume moves generally indicate there's strength behind a move and visa versa. Trading 101.

fucking 250 bitcoin, kidnapping people.....in US that's like 40 years in prison...worth it? How bout spend 1/1000000th of that time you'd spend in jail on a job? How bout it? Or too lazy?

NASA has certainly accomplished more than SpaceX. But I get it, a 15 y/o copmany, SpaceX has the brighter future. I don't know what happened, but at one point we decided going to Mars was not a priority. We stopped dreaming. NASA, and the old guard...go ahead and stop dreaming...actually keep up the cool satellite projects you're working on and exo-planet stuff/ FTL travel, but here's to SpaceX bringing those dreams back.

he invented PayPal, Tesla, and SpaceX....we jerk off to him because unlike the old guard, we see what a difference he's made in this world. NASA and the old-guard couldn't put a man on Mars, so move the hell over. Time for a one man army to do it. That's one of many reasons reddit likes him.

I have it at 2030. Very exciting. Elon says 2024, men on Mars, but I say 2030 and anything earlier is a plus.

That’s a risk of crypto. You pay a tax on your gain. So if you bought BTC At $10k, sold at $15k, you pay $5k in taxes. If you haven’t sold (and are still holding the original crypto) there’s no taxable event. You have realized your capital gains. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:49:10
I don’t own crypto, but do you pay taxes in coin that was seized or in a brokerage that was shut down?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:11:19


Ya that's what you do. In a bear market. But if you're expecting BTC to go up long term, time in the market &gt; timing the market.

Tax rates used to be around 70-90% in the U.S. high of like 91% during the War (2nd WW). Then in 1986 started changes. Wider tax base (more things can be taxes). But lower taxes.

theres no way to retrieve SR btc right?
btw you never woulda held it for 5 years. I had like 300 LTC back then but I never woulda held to $300. 
I'm more a "not interested in buying but still want btc to succeed coiner"
