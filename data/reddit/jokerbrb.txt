Which places would you recommend me to go do my homework? Thanks.

Right, but there isn't another way around it, is there? I mean, I probably should never use this address again but at every transaction I make, I will create an association of my username with a wallet.

Thanks! How does backup work? What happens if I spend the money and restore a previous backup where I hadn't spent the money yet?
Also, my wallet is not encrypted? If I grant root access to a dubious app that can access it, does that mean it has direct access to my money and is allowed to make transactions with it?
To keep the majority of my coins at home, does that mean I have to transfer them to another wallet I have on my PC on another address? Sorry again for all these basic questions.

Thanks! One last question: What are you (and others here) mostly using bitcoins for?

OK so inspired by this I just created a wallet too with the android app. Is that my wallet now 1EYeoE3yxyWBv9nhG19Sd5Y3gaihz5MhbC? 
Three follow up questions: how easy it is for someone to find out who i am from this address? The safety notes shown on the app are a bit scary. How easy it is for another app to hack into it? How does that tip bot you're using here work? Sorry if these are too basic questions. Thanks!
