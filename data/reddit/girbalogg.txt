I understand it is not your fault to be on Hartz4, but it is usually those people on Hartz4 buying unhealthy and expensive food.
You can make much healthier Pizza with ingredients bought from local farmer markets for half the price than those from these delivery services.
My opinion is people on Hartz4 should be banned from making business with those companies (lieferservice.de and McDonalds) for public health reasons.

Isn't lieferservice.de the place where those Hartz4 Empfängers buy their food besides McDonalds?

Thanks, I already made a backup of the wallet and am currently downloading the huge blockchain.
I will give it a try as soon as downloading the blockchain is finished.
Is Kraken legit? Do you know where they are from and who operates them?
I will need to ask my lawyer first about the tax situation since I am holding the bitcoin for more than a year they should be excempt from capital gains tax in my country but not sure how to prove it.

Yeah, real Italian pizza is something totally different thing from the crap you get at these delivery services.
Real Italian restaurants never have a delivery service though but a real restaurant.

They had very nasty Pizza anyways, only those nasty pizza shops run by foreign immigrants were under lieferservice.de.
Pizzas were always full of oil and fat and cheap fake cheese a.k.a. Analogkäse
