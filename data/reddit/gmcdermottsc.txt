I like it! Great job!

That's how 1.05 on ios works. 1.06, won't let you switch back and forth between USD and BTC on the deposit screen. Unless there is something I am missing...
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:46:31
I linked my account to changetip. Any tips on getting tips?

The latest iOS 1.0.6 version only lets you deposit dollars. You don't know how much Bitcoin you are buying or what price circle is charging until you buy. I will stick with the older version 1.0.5

Looks like the cause of the fire was an overloaded circuit.

It is a front end to about three exchanges. You buy from the exchange with the lowest price automatically. I have bought coins from them and sent to my local wallet.

Put in at least 5.05 and get out 15. With these low bitcoin prices, how can you go wrong. I have bought from them a couple of times with zero problems.

Cool list.

Sold some at 300 during a spike, already up, zero fees paid. I like it.

Why is there a 500 usd limit per day on ACH?

There are good people in the world.
@_date: 2015-05-20 22:32:35
Good idea. This would work well.

This is a giant ad for libratax. 
@_date: 2017-01-29 20:51:36
Yes it is legit. Great place to get coins instantly. Check out the volume

Arcbit for iOS will watch a Trezor account if you provide the xpub key. This works well.
@_date: 2016-12-26 21:33:28
I emailed support a few days ago right after it happened. I never received an email back or an email when the transfer failed.
@_date: 2016-12-26 20:33:48
I tried to buy some coin on ipayyou.io, my transfer failed after the price went up. Not sure if I will try again after that.
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:30:31
It would be great if it could accept an xpub key to watch multiple addresses within an hd wallet. I like the guest login feature.

I noticed that if I paste a strong password generated from another source, it will say it is too weak even though it is 16 digits of randomness with symbols etc.

I like ztrader for android. It will trade on multiple exchanges through api and has charts. It is on Google play.

Upgraded from 0.92 to 0.93 with Bitcoin core .10. Asked to delete database, I said yes. It freezes creating the database. Tried a few times to delete the database files manually. I'm glad I moved my funds to a Trezor before the upgrade. Help.
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:38:59
You are doing great work here. Thanks
@_date: 2015-03-12 11:52:03
It gives an error during signup. Tried a couple of times.
@_date: 2015-02-03 12:50:13
I have a solution too. Just buy a  real Trezor.
