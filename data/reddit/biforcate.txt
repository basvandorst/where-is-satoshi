Say, 2.3Btc each? Somewhere around there. 
Edit: wait, looks like that's too much.. I think there going for around 6-700, is that right? So in that neighborhood I think.

GOGDAMMIT COINBASE!  Let me buy some coins!  Their stupid 24 hr limit has been in place all day. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:57:56
In my wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:10:23
Not so strong after all, amarite?

How do you type with boxing gloves on your hands?
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:38:53
Really really wish coinbase would sell me some coin right now. :(
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:44:26
Stupid goddamn mother fucking coinbase.  &gt;:(

 I tried all day to buy coins, but Coinbase said it was at its 24 hour limit.  Got home from work and tried one more time, and suddenly coins were $23 and I could buy them!  Everything went better than expected. :)

This has been my experience.
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:30:20
9000!!??  There's no way that can be right.

You guys have really got to pull your heads out and do whatever the hell it takes to make bitcoins available to your customers.  Your facebook page, twitter page, and other threads here and on the bitcoin forums are full of angry people who want to buy coins but can't.  Unfuck yourselves and make your goddamn service do what it's supposed to do or people are going to drop your ass in droves.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:00:58
Yup.  I think it's past time to explore other options.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:32:40
Yup.  Just send your coins to whichever address you want them to be at.

Spam mode activated.  I'd love to grab some right now.

Same thing happened with me.  Sent 11.5 btc out of coinbase to another wallet.  Transaction was listed as pending for a while.  Then the next morning the transaction was no longer listed, but my coinbase total was still down the 11.5 btc.  Stayed like that for a day.  Then today my balance was back to normal (+11.5 btc), but the transaction was still gone.  I re-sent the 11.5 btc and this time the transaction went through, with about an hour's delay.
So your coins aren't gone, you're just dealing with coinbase delays.

He means at even though the address ledger is public, it's quite easy to hide which addresses you own.

Yea, I'm going to have to agree.  OP might be helped by re-visiting the fundamentals of the bitcoin protocol.  There are a lot of good write ups and youtube videos that explain how it all works.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:50:40
Are you sure it wasn't just sent to a change address in your wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:03:31
The coolest thing about bitcoin is that while the exchanges were going apeshit and the price crashed, the core bitcoin protocol was just chugging along giving zero fucks.  As long as there is internet, there will be bitcoin because of its advantages as a means to transfer money compared to everything else there is.

I'll tell you for 950.

1. Print out a physical wallet and transfer some coin to the addresses you print.  Put the paper in a bank security box or burry it in your back yard.
2. Keep multiple copies of your wallet.  Instead of a single USB, get several.  Encrypt them and put one in your bank box, one in your back yard, email one to yourself, one in Dropbox... Etc.  just make sure your encryption pass phrase is good.
@_date: 2013-03-22 23:11:58
Finally!  Finally got me some coins.  Seriously, 9000 clicks were required. :/
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:31:13
I got some last weekend...  But today, no.  I was spamming the buy button and reloading during crashes, but to no avail.  Missed out on a golden opportunity to buy more coin.  Thanks a lot you coinbase fucking fuckers.  Seriously, unfuck your shit. &gt;:(

They are just a bitcoin address with its associated private key printed on a piece of paper.  If you've taken steps to ensure that the private key for that address only exists on that piece of paper, an attacker would not be able to find that key on your computer or online exchange/wallet.  To access your funds, you would use a wallet program which enables the import of private keys.  The wallet can then access the funds assigned to that address.  
Caution: if you import and spend a portion of the funds on a paper wallet (address/key pair), the remainder may be sent to a different address in your electronic wallet leaving your paper wallet address with a zero balance.
