They also sell your data (in an anonymized way)

I think I may not have been clear enough.  My question was that - given people won't use it as a currency until it becomes less volatile - when do people who believe that Bitcoin could replace Fiat (rather than gold) suspect that might be?
I understand that price volatility is more related to supply than adoption.

I'm relatively new (last 12 months) to Bitcoin, and even newer to this community.  At this point, I strongly believe that it will give gold a strong run for its money as the world's largest store of value, and excited to be a hodler.
However, due mainly to its volatility, I am highly, highly skeptical that it could be used as a replacement for fiat currency, at least in my lifetime.
I feel like that is the consensus among most, but I keep seeing posts/articles suggesting the latter may still be possible.
Where do other's thoughts lie?

That's quite interesting, thanks!  I'm curious, when is your best guess as to when volatility could drop enough for people to adopt it as a means of payment?  Once supply runs out?  5 years after?  20?

DID YOU JUST ASSUME THEIR GENDER

This.  Banks USED to make money from investing your savings. Now they engage in shadier and shadier loans (first mortgage, now autos) until everyone defaults and the government prints money for them

Is that the girl from stanger things?!

Fair play.  "Traditional Fiat" would have been more accurate.

I'm terribly unresearched on this topic - why would I want to store my crypto on a physical device (that I could lose), rather in the cloud (presuming coinbase would refund hacking/theft)?

Wow, cheers for the thoughtful response here.  I was assuming Coinbase would repay me, but you're right -- I don't see any guarantee that they would.  I'm buying one of these.
