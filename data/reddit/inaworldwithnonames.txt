Just commenting so I see what people say. I have coinbase and I can't sell at all through the app in Canada

Yea i never do math.  I understand the basic math needed  for figuring it out though once I get it explained to me. I got it now pretty easy stuff no matter what numbers you're using.

I wonder this too. Where does the money come from. And how long does it take. If you go to sell $85000 in bitcoin tomorrow. And you want your $85000. Who do you go to. Who do they go to. Who physically has the cash.

I wouldnt know what to be more upset over. the fact that you can't access your coins or the fact that the price is plummeting and they're not worth half of what they once were. tough go man sorry you're dealing with that.
