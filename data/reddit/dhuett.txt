eskick, thank you for the feedback. It is much appreciated. 
Forgive me for being a newbie on Reddit. But then, everyone must start out clumsy and unlearned. Apparently, I've already offended a few if I understand this properly: 1 up vote 6 down votes. Please, accept my sincere apology. 
I've had an account here for many years, but never used it. I am only here today because the site at BTCJam, which I just discovered yesterday, had a Reddit community button, which reminded me of my unused and ancient account. So, I thought I would click on it to visit Reddit. 
It would seem I'm off to a bad start already. I would appreciate any guidance, should I further offend anyone with my apparent clumsiness. This I might, because I'm starting to like what I see here. Thus, I am quite likely to return. Obviously, Reddit has improved considerably since I first joined it many years ago. 
As a sysop, and as one who spent many years, over a decade, developing the Internet long before the first website ever appeared, probably my website, which appeared nearly twenty years ago, I take a great interest in new concepts and innovations. There is perhaps a bit too much nerd inside me, for I'm willing to pay interest on borrowing bitcoin at BTCJam which I don't need just to see the whole thing work first-hand. I find the concept exciting, most especially since it grants us a newfound independence from government and banking cartels. 
That's the truth, I didn't use the post button from the BTCJam site to advertise here, I clicked it out of curiosity and then decided to get community feedback about BTCJam. I value what you might think of the website I just found. The nerd in me is far more interested in shaking up the black boxto see what happens than anything else. 
As Dr. McCoy on Star Trek might say: Damn it Jim, I'm a system administrator, not a marketing agent!
