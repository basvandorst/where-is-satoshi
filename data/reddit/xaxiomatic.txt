Yeah we are more or less to the point where libra was announced. I can kind of understand why it pushed the market higher but personally I wish they clamp down on it hard so I really don't mind the drop.
Assuming that it's related. What I've seen from the congress hearings I'm bullish on the fact that either the sentiment there is pro-bitcoin or at worst indifference. And that we might see strong oposition to ZuckBucks.
Healthy in the long run but some downside in the short term. I don't think ZuckBucks would have turned out to be a boost to bitcoin anyway and we would just get an even more distopian version of WeChat's/AliPay systems.
Another walled garden with more surveillance by the big tech giants and a censurable currency with wide adoption.
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:26:37
It speaks to its viability as a payment system.
This is a very narrow view and is just cherry picking imho.

Yeah I was using the term a bit in jest.

Honestly some regulation would be a good thing. More in terms of regulating any service that has custody of customer deposits. Mostly thinking of exchanges here and how trading and hot/cold wallets are handled. Trading could also be made a bit more transparent as well as the financial reporting. That would not really be touching bitcoin just the services built on top.

Honestly if BTC just retains it's purchasing power then it's better than fiat.

The fees should outstrip the reward way before the last halving. Even in the 13th reward era the amount per block is scheduled to be like 0.0122 and some change. And there are 34 halvings total.
Whatever the effect will be I think we can agree that we will start to feel the effect much sooner than the last halving.

Could you recommend some reading where this is described in more detail possibly with some analysis of real market data? Any market is fine it does not necessarily have to be crypto...
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:53:51
Honestly I would encourage everyone to at least make the effort to learn enough about securing your coins yourself and decide after if you still want to leave it on an exchange.
It's partially the reason why bitcoin was invented in the first place. To disperse the risk between individuals and remove institutions that are to big to fail.

Answer me this why is it so important to have one chain win out and the other die? 
There is a genuine use case for fast cheap transactions at the moment. Bitcoin cash could serve that market perfectly fine since not all kinds of transactions need to be at the same level of decentralization and security. So why not put your focus there.
And there is an equal need for a  highly secure store of value. There is literally 0 need for it to be a fight to the death for both chains. Ver does not want to compete he wants a monopoly. 
You guys crack me up with the free speech thing though. The amount of platforms available today to get your point across is the highest it has ever been in human history.

Yeah well the BCH community should distance itself from that guy then.

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:09:50

Yeah really. Sansa can be LTC it would suite her.
@_date: 2019-07-31 21:46:04
It's consensus. If you can get enough users to agree that there is a need to do it it will be done and the majority will follow the new chain.
We might come to a point where most agree that some inflation of supply is desireable. However the difference is that it needs majority support of the people using it. Rather than the arbitrary decision of a select few we have with current fiat systems.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:31:22

@_date: 2019-07-19 07:50:03
After that we should still see some volatility due to the falling inflation of BTC compared to fiat.
A steady rise. That's if the demand stays the same and does not ramp up much.

Nothing works in situations like these except barter. Their problems are bigger than a dysfunctional currency.
Once they get out of this they can use BTC to rebuild and maybe not repeat the cycle. 
@_date: 2019-03-06 06:51:17
While I somewhat agree with your point. 17% does not seem insignificant.
And while cards have their utility phasing out cash removes the physical aspect of ownership and control. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 06:17:49
They work until they do not.
Eventually there will always come a situation where the temptation will be there to do it. I have lived through a period of hyperinflation and it is not exactly something that is readily apparent when it starts. The period when 0s are added at a rapid level is just the dam bursting. 
Bitcoin just removes the reasons listed completly from the equation. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 19:47:12
Insurance really does not improve the situation a lot. The main issue with exchanges is that similar to banks  they create large concentrations of capital and when one goes poof the entire network is affected along with most of the users.
That being said if you are not capable of safeguarding your coin might as well put it where there is some remedy if things go sour. I doubt that there will be a point when every user is ready to secure their funds sufficiently.
@_date: 2019-03-09 18:53:38
I read it more as the collapse of physical delivery and the viability of physical cash as a payment method. Not quite the collapse of currency as a whole.
Which is kind of good for btc since it can move in to fill that gap.

Simplified  against vanguard S&amp;P fund.
You can also find calculators that do it against other historical stock market data. Over longer periods it's slightly worse or break even.
I do however think it has a place especially for a newbie investor. Because it makes you used to investing what you can afford regularly. And thinking about how much that is.
I'd rather not see many "I just cashed out of my IRA to crypto when is it hitting 50k?" threads :). So I'm not saying it's worthless or something like that.
@_date: 2019-03-20 07:11:42
That is exactlly how they work. Every $ that is created is encumbered by debt. The sooner you can get it the less interest you need to pay. Access is limited however so it does not work out for the regular people.

I don't know why people are so much against trading. 
You can start with some obscenely small amount like 1% of your holdings. Do not ever touch the rest. 
Learn on that and slowly increase when you get the hang of it and if you enjoy it. At worst you're down 1%.

The other subreddit has this weird perception of reality. When BCH is more profitable they were shouting that this will make BTC crumble since miners would deflect en masse.
But now that the pendulum has swung the reverse does not apply.
They are likely right but that just tells you what kind of actors are behind BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:19:55
1. Agreed for new folks that's perfectly fine. The swing from 1300 to 170 is where this will naturally work out better so it's cherrypicking a bit. DCA outperforms during downswings and flat periods.
2. Any individual stock can go to 0. Lump sum is better if you're betting on long term appreciation anyway. I'd rather put in a smaller amount today and adjust based on reduced risk when there is basis for that. But I can handle 80 or more % swings. 
3. Agreed.
4. Agreed.
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:10:45
That's all true but it is still better for the entire crypto ecosystem if the user is retained (not burned to badly). Stuff like this never had a lasting effect on worthwhile tech so I'm not worried either.

You are right none of them have. At the moment bitcoin is a high risk high reward asset class and should be treated as such. Investing in it is smart. Putting in your life savings not so much. 
The same basic rules still apply preserve your capital and diversify.
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:02:07
And BCH is loosing steam. I think a lot of people are on the sidelines waiting for it to play out. Now confidence is slowly returning. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:24:47
No early adopters took the most risk that's why they are rewarded with the biggest gains. They get rich we get a stable currency that is not devalued on a whim.
The only way bitcoin is like a ponzi if satoshi decides to cash out all at once. And even then I think the price would recover eventually. I find the fact that bitcoin is deflationary rather liberating.
We've been taught inflation is great because it leads to growth growth growth. But that growth has almost made living on this planet unsustainable. I think it's time for balance.

At worst they would need to account for the eventuality of the original chain crashing and burning. 
There is a chance that the crypto markets completely implode for the short term, forcing them out of business. 
Frankly I'm surprised someone is willing to risk that much.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:01:09
The tech behind bitcoin is solid. It has some groundbreaking solutions to problems that were not solved until it came along. 
Contrary to the economic dogma all other central banks follow it is designed to benefit everyone equally.
It has potential at the moment and that's all. If that potential is realised is unknown. It took us a couple of centuries to switch from minted coins to paper money. Credit cards took half a century.
Bitcoin is 8 years old. My guess is another decade or so.
There will be drops and bumps along the way. The price will come down so it depends for how long you intend to stay in the game. I'd like for most of my transactions to be crypto at some point in my life so I'm staying put until that happens or it goes to 0. 
If you're nervous you're either speculating on short term gains or you're over invested. The first is like educated gambling the second is almost always a mistake.
 
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:42:32
You're talking about diversifying. That's the first thing you should do anyway regardless of the bitcoin debate. 
But cashing out completely is dumb. Set a % target of your net worth that you feel comfortable with ( accepting the fact bitcoin can go to 0 ) based on how risky you think it is compared to other investments.
Then just rebalance every couple of years if it makes you uncomfortable or not at all. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:46:34
Trade with 5% of your btc holdings or less. Consider it money gone. If you don't like it stop. I always trade shitcoins against BTC I don't even care about what the USD amount is. As long as I increase my BTC amount over time it's all good.

Since he is a minor this could get challenging and I wont offer any further advice since investing is more of a hobby.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:37:37
There is a chance of every investment going to 0. 
Enron, Lehman brothers, Madoff fund... those were all seen as solid investments by the general consensus at that time. Sure there might have been a few smart folks who saw the scams but not many. And they all collapsed within a blink of an eye.
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:55:44
Well I'm up at about double from what I started from so half is going back into the hodling piggybank. So even if I trade myself to 0 I'm not down anything other than the time investment.
But seeing that it's kind of fun I consider it time well spent.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:49:32
Depends how the price goes and what volume will be converted to fiat if they decide to cut their losses. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:23:39
In the end this might be a good thing. If it proves that bitcoin is strong enough to resist a FUD storm it will boost confidence and that will only help with adoption.
The price has not budged much other than yesterday's dip. So overall it seems it is resisting quite well.
A part of this is probably due to users hodling but that is sound investment advice anyway... the user base seems to have their shit together on that front.
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:18:26
Solar and wind are not there yet. They have parity in some areas but are still more expensive in a lot of places. The negative prices we've been seeing in EU are based on weather and they are not permanent.
So you'd need batteries to run your equipment at full tilt all the time.
Hydro is king. Just because the capital expenditure on those power plants has mostly been paid of already and they are operating at pure profit - operational costs. And those costs are small. It's old tech so first mover advantage and all that... 
Mind you I love solar and wind and I hope we keep subsidizing until they are the cheapest sources out there. It's just that they're not quite there yet. Besides every other source is subsidized as well including coal/nuclear... so go figure.

Blocks are mined at a fixed rate of 10 min on average. The variance you see sometimes is more or less down to chance. The higher fee just increases your chance that your transaction will be preferred by the miners and included in the blocks faster.
You can mine empty blocks or half full if you decide to forgo the fees from transactions. There is no need for them to be full.
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:29:16
My 2c is that it is a fear based thing. We are taught that fiat is a "safe" system. Where the government and banks offer security in exchange for controlling monetary policy.
Bitcoin has none of that it only offers true ownership and a math formula instead. This is scary to most people. Losing all your coins is a possibility and there is nowhere to appeal to in case it happens. So is currency depreciation since it's a free market and no centrally managed levers to pull if the value drops.
I think long term we can break these barriers but it will take a while more.
@_date: 2019-08-30 06:36:59

@_date: 2019-02-28 08:42:59
No. It's a market gap that no inflationary FIAT currency serves at the moment. If a nation state government decided to have a fixed monetary policy people would still probably buy for the same reasons they but BTC now.
Except it would have been weaker and not have the other benefits that BTC does. Saving is a use case. It used to be more of a thing before the economic elite decided we need to get rid of it... hence the market gap.
You can call it speculation but it's more speculating that the use case is still valid in the long term and that purely debt driven currencies are incomplete in what society demands from them. Yes price appreciation or stability is expected in the long term.

Well i never said that it cant scale on chain. It can the unlimited guys are doing great work in that regard.
However i don't think at this point in time the trade off is worth it or that it ever will be. 
I don't like fees just as much as the next person. But if paying them means that the barrier to entry into the network is kept low I am somewhat willing to pay them. 
But that comes down more to how I want the network to develop. I can understand why people would want bigger blocks since it is a straight up increase. So there is a bit of subjectivity involved I admit.

Imo just lowering the block size wont help regardless of tech progress. There is no incentive to run a node and marginal benefits for doing it. Even if you lowered the bloc ksize the weakness would still remain.

Well the original design intended to do that with mining rewards. It did not account for mining pooling and specialised hardware which came after.
And the system never evolved to fill that gap. Lightning might cover some of this with routing fees and general adoption might as well if services run their own nodes instead of relying on cloud wallets and the like.

No need for a 51% attack or even mining. They control the software and the protocol so they can build in an arbitrary set of rules that would allow them to do that. Essentially a back door of their choosing.

Ok so for the entirety of human history currency was usually issued by nation governments, kingdoms, etc... and monetary policy was set by those who had economic, military or political power.
So how long do you think exactly it takes for humans to switch the mindset that those things don't necessarily need to back a currency for it to be valid. It certainly isn't as short as 10 years...
And of course assuming it can work at all. I'd give it a generation if not more...

@_date: 2017-11-15 08:28:08
Actually that statement is a bit inaccurate. There is an unlimited supply of bitcoins. The constraint of 21 million is enforced by the consensus rules of the network. Those can be changed if needed. 
We are nowhere close to where we would need to start discussing monetary policy. Probably around 2100 or thereabouts.
Currently bitcoin rules are designed to mimic gold somewhat. They are exactly what is needed for growth and adoption at this point in time.
It serves a gap in the currency markets for people who do not wish to be fully invested in the debt cycle that is pushed by every central bank around the world.
In other words we will deal with that problem when we come to it.

Oh I think it is the miners. They have the most control at the moment. All that congestion is pushing up the fees meaning more BTC to mine. BTC that can be used to further push up the value of the fork and suppress the original chain price.
I think the first pump was just a test run to see if they could pull this off.

3 and 4 are rather normal when trying to solve hard problems. Once you dig in into the problem and start crunching numbers you sometimes find that your assumptions are wrong and you will break more shit than you are going to fix with what you intended.
5 happens as a result sometimes because someone tries to force the issue because of impatience. More often than not this driven by an extremely short view of the current state and mostly ignoring all the technical arguments. They were promised a fix so they feel entitled to it.
I am sad to say this is an often seen occurrence in the development process.

Well I am not assuming that this kind of thing would be either cheap or practical to do for a normal user.
Shaming is one thing but if you are willing to burn your bridges why not.
The mempool certainly wont tell you this since this kind of an attack would be impossible to distinguish from normal congestion patterns.
Mind you I am not arguing that this is what is happening. I am asking more for my own understanding how the network works. So thank you for indulging my curiosity.

POW is not really the reason why the transaction fees are as high as they are. The 10 minute block frequency and the block size are the 2 variables that impact the fees not the POW algorithm. 
Basically you could have every piece of silicon on planet earth doing SHA256 and the amount of transaction space available within any given time period would still be the same. Meaning TXs would not get mined any faster and fees would not be lower than they are right now.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:15:39
Increasing frequency is probably worse yeah. 
You need even more bandwidth and possibly more storage due to overhead. You get more forks (not the code kind but the network kind). Sometimes the network is in disagreement on which chain variant is the right one and it takes a bit of time for that to settle on it. Some hashpower is wasted as a result. Which might not be such a big deal considering how much of it there is at the moment.
Those are the downsides I can think of the top of my head. 
It is probably even worse than a straight up block increase.
None of this is a good solution to anything.

Sounds like multisig where the 2nd (or the nth key) is only able to unlock when a certain height is reached.
I think that is well within the means of the scripting that is available. No idea if any wallet actually implements anything like it though.

Another way to look at it is that Inflation causes overconsumption and a horribly inefficient use of resources. Right now I would rather tackle the problem of how to solve unemployment than continue down the path we are currently on.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:52:47
Not really. Or at least not as much as you think. They provide security not transactional throughput. 
A laptop would technically be enough to send the transactions to the chain assuming you can get past the difficulty adjustment or adopt a different way of adjusting for hashrate drops.
They provide a valuable service but the impact is not as high as many people think.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:22:18
Well I was thinking more along the lines if you tried to do it gradually over time.
First spam the lower layers of the pool forcing those users to up the tx fee.
Then slowly raise the fee value of the spam pushing the user to set higher and higher fess on his own transactions in order for them to get a better chance for it to go through. So a gradual ramp up.
So assuming the spam is set at 10s/b right now and we are both paying 11s/b and happily transacting. 
The spammer raises his tx fee to 11 and we are both forced to compete with the spam again and raise our fees...
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:16:45
Not to be confused with BCHC off course.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:07:17
Well if bitcoin is not designed well enough to resist that kind of attack then it does not deserve the market price it has at the moment.
I have a sufficient stake that it would hurt for a while but I would rather see it go to 0 than more people putting money into it if it is as week that it cannot overcome this.
@_date: 2019-06-11 10:48:05
Decentralizing the financial system would already be amazing. I think we will really only get there once another crisis hits the sector. And we once again see that a lot of it is still "to big to fail".

@_date: 2017-11-16 06:21:41
Yes it is. I am just pointing out something that is often misunderstood which is that raising silicone capacity will do nothing much for transaction speed or throughput. I am using an extreme case to point this out. In theory you could hard fork the difficulty if the shit hit the fan. But that would devastate the price most likely.
Miners dont provide tx capacity past one adjustment just security. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 09:05:13
Fine risk then if you dislike to it being referred as a bet. It makes no difference. I hold btc not because of speculation but because of the reasons it was made, the base underlying protocol and the monetary rules set by it's creator. It comes with a high amount of risk and I'm fine with that. It's probably something most people should stay away from at this point in time but that's also fine.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:05:02

Not sure if I follow. Assuming I wanted to get a minimum fee transaction through and I was competing with 1000s of low fee spam transactions with the same fee. 
Why would mine get picked over the others? Once it gets droped from the mempool at that point my choice is to wait or raise my fee for it to go through.

Not necessarily. This would actually make some semblance of sense. Electricity costs and running expenses could have been one of the reasons for the dump.

@_date: 2018-03-15 17:42:24

I can see this dragging on for a year more or further. Alt-coins are still valued to highly compared to what they bring to the table. I don't see us reversing the trend until the halving is in and lightning starts to catch on en masse.
I would do layered buys but that's just me.
@_date: 2019-01-28 18:06:13
Honestly what intrigues me much more than what will happen after or before the halving is what will happen with bitcoin when the next serious economic downturn hits.
It was partially created as a response to the events of the last one so I am more curious if the idea will stand that test and improve matters.
@_date: 2019-01-29 05:45:14
Erm economies are cyclical so it is not like it  might or might not happen. Unless you think we have entered some unprecedented time in human history where this no longer holds true.
It is more a question of when, how hard, and will bitcoin improve things. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 19:45:09
At the moment the mempool is filled with txs paying a higher fee than yours. Probably all the selling going on.

@_date: 2019-01-29 17:07:16
Yeah I am pretty sure I did not as we actually can observe this in Venezuela to a limited degree. Where banks and government no longer functions to serve the people yet bitcoin continues to do so.
But please elaborate if you had a different point to make. I am curious and will grant that bitcoin collapsing when the crisis hits is a possibility but disagree with the notion that it is a guaranteed outcome. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 08:49:16
Just paid 8$ for a SWIFT transfer and I have to wait till monday for it to go through.
 Yeah bitcoin fees suck...
@_date: 2019-01-28 20:19:04
Yeah that depends on your viewpoint. Space on the block-chain is at a premium in times of high demand. So you either pay for speed of the transaction or wait until demand falls down. It is kind of a core design choice really and will probably remain like it is because there is nothing to actually fix.
It is rather a complex subject and more intricate than I am able to go into detail about. But it is basically what the whole argument about blocksize and the BTC/BCH split was about (at least on the surface).
Personally I think the decision to solve this with a 2nd layer protocol (lightning) is the correct one but that is just imho.
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:25:42
When I first read up on the electricity and hardware reqs I thought damn what a waste.
Now I am not so sure any more. It is a tremendous amount of energy going out the window but at the same time it is no longer trivial to attack the network computationally. It could still be done I think but we are fast approaching a point where I dont think it will be possible at all. 
If you wanted global trust this is the way to do it. With enough capacity where no one state can mount the resources to break it. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 23:19:42
The trick is not selling... 
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:44:14
I think we agree I didn't mean that the dip would cause a multi year bear market. Just that there are still a lot of events that will cause a significant price shift.
In some sectors yeah but a broad selloff of 50% across the board is just fear.
People were selling everything even in sectors that were perfectly poised to not to be affected by the crisis all that much. Still pretty thankful to all the people that sold of unilever to 16 bucks a share for example... that shit bounced back to pre dip levels in 9 months.
I agree that the trigger was the fundamentals in financials/housing.

Illegal goods with high demand usually skyrocket in price. Just saying... depends how strong of a demand bitcoin has behind it when someone bans it.

I was speaking more in terms of scaling out development rather than decentralization. As a developer you always want more time to make sure the product is as good as it can be. 
The pressure is less if it is a niche product but with success also comes the pressure and need to scale out and you should not be afraid of that.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:37:26
Silly question but was this not kind of an expected development at some point. I never saw governments just gladly accepting an alternative currency without a fight. 
And since China is one of the most tightly controlled countries outside North Korea this is not really all that surprising. 
Idk I think it is more of a signal that bitcoin is doing its job. It is as expected a disaster for the short term price though.

It can be changed with a hardfork when and if needed. Deflation has its share of problems and we will need to change it if it becomes problematic. But we are a long long away from that.
The main point is changes to monetary policy cant be just made by a select cabal of people who primarily care only about their interest. Instead they would require a broad community consensus before they can be made.

Yes they do. Credit card companies get money on every transaction. The merchant pays it.

It is a percentage around 0.1% split between the card company and both banks involved in the transaction.
@_date: 2017-09-20 04:33:04
Sure we do. Governments dont however. This whole thing was never to go over peacefully everywhere. Bitcoin is a direct threat to the power that nation states hold at the moment. At worst it might be even destabilizing in some cases. It was designed for that puropose.

It is not now. But it might be in the future. There is no timeline by which this needs to happen you just need solid forward progress in small steps.
LN could add sufficient capacity to drive momentum further. This does not have to happen overnight. I think we are still looking at 10-15 more years of solid development before that kind of scale would be within reach.
There are tons of people who just see the current price and think bubble. I am more interested in where the tech and the idea could go in the long run. It will be either moon or bust same as most startup tech products. The only trick here is evaluating if the progress is sound and not to get to emotionally attached to the price. I really dont care what the price is at any given time.

I dont know of any case where I could reliably say that happened. 
Although I have seen weird stuff in the old eastern eu block when inflation was sky high, foreign currency exchange was regulated and the deutsche mark was used as a value store.
If people are willing to pay a premium, willing to risk legal consequences and the volume is there. Then yeah I would say that is an indicator of strong demand.

LN could add sufficient capacity to drive momentum further. This does not have to happen overnight. I think we are still looking at 10-15 more years of solid development before that kind of scale would be within reach.
There are tons of people who just see the current price and think bubble. I am more interested in where the tech and the idea could go in the long run. It will be either moon or bust same as most startup tech products. The only trick here is evaluating if the progress is sound and not to get to emotionally attached to the price. I really dont care what the price is at any given time.

It can be changed with a hardfork when and if needed. Deflation has its share of problems and we will need to change it if it becomes problematic. But we are a long long away from that.
The main point is changes to monetary policy cant be just made by a select cabal of people who primarily care only about their interest. Instead they would require a broad community consensus before they can be made.

Well volunteer work is work. I would say that it is even better work than the 9-5 grind. So we are of the same mindset I think. 
And I doubt i would stop coding completely just do it less frequently and rather code stuff I find fun.
But I have the advantage of a couple of decades and I can imagine that I will be just as sick of it by the time I am 56.

How about all the drama over what is essentially a "static const unsigned int" declaration.
Seriously engineers should have the first say in when to change that and only when they fail should we try other options. Yet we have people who have not wrote a line of code in their life trying to make those decisions. How much energy is being expended over a simple engineering decision.

Silly question but was this not kind of an expected development at some point. I never saw governments just gladly accepting an alternative currency without a fight. 
And since China is one of the most tightly controlled countries outside North Korea this is not really all that surprising. 
Idk I think it is more of a signal that bitcoin is doing its job. It is as expected a disaster for the short term price though.
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:19:55
So why not bitcoin? Developing groundbreaking tech is hard. It is not like there is a road map out there to follow. I would say there are obstacles to overcome but I dont see anything else that would fit the bill at the moment.
I mean humanity only ever managed to pull this off once before with the internet. And that took like 20 years from the first pilot to the first .com domain. And people still didnt know what to do with it at that point or understand what it could mean in the long run.

Ask yourself this. After closing down exchanges what is the single biggest source of crypto in the country.
Unless they have their hooks in the mining operations. They will ban them as soon as most people realize that the easiest way to get crypto is from the mining operations directly.

I doubt it. The spike took 5 minutes. This is automated.

Funny I never thought of retirement as the point when I stop working. It is more about working on stuff only I chose to work on without having to worry about how much money that is going to bring in.

Hodling is not a meme. It is about the best strategy for a retail investor assuming he has made good investment choices. Predicting the markets is hard and even pros more or less cannot beat the market.
Warren Buffet is a long term hodler for example.

You should try nano-cap biotech. It'll make crypto seem like a snooze fest.
Honestly you have not lived until you get a 90% drop and rebound within the same day.
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:23:29
That entirely depends on the amount of demand for bitcoin on the black market.  The easiest way to shut it down is to go after the source. I dont think there is a reliable way to predict that. You might be right and it will not be such a big deal. 
I am just saying that it might be not as clear cut as it seems. They have already cut of their economy from a potentially great market. They might do so again if it becomes to much of a pain point.  
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:11:10
You misunderstood. This is a product by scammers for scammers. 
And there is a large target audience out there for this kind of service. You can draw some parallels to "enterprise grade" software. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:30:27
You forgot "China bans bitcoin..."
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:10:06
Sure I'll gladly sell you mine for 150k and you pocket the difference.
And if it goes in the opposite direction people will still find ways of buying it to keep inflation away from their savings.
All that would do is create a black market for bitcoins. Trust me I lived in a socialist part of europe and I've seen this first hand with fiat for many years.

No this is exactly what makes gold valuable. A condensed store of wealth you can put in your pocket or bury in the ground where no one can get to it.
The whole it looks pretty and conducts electricity argument is entirely missing the point.
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:11:10
Nah OP has a point. A 125% return is pretty good. It shows the market has confidence in the company results and management.
But the same can be said about crypto. This is is not a 0 sum thing. 
You can run a bank well and still be dead wrong about bitcoin. The two are not mutually exclusive.

If Coinbase gets hacked or pulls a MtGox or Bitstamp again we'd see a broad selloff way bellow Segwit levels. 
Just look at stocks which are supposed to be a more secure investment. We still saw a broad selloff in 2008 due to panic. It was not related to the underlying investments as much as it was to human emotion first and foremost. Most markets are confidence driven much as we like to pretend otherwise.

How about we find some more use cases with LN first.
I would rather see more utility added before another bull run.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:25:58
Two weeks.

Erm... ok. I am sure there are tons of worthwhile investments that Buffet will not make. So I kind of fail to see the point.
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:12:42
Lets see. 
I am investing in the core dev team. All the developers and entrepreneurs that have built on top of the network so far. All the future devs that will build on top of LN. And all the miners who run the HW to secure the net.
Seems solid to me... 
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:50:36
Ah well It wasn't me who quoted him the poster above me did. I am not trying to rationalize anything after the fact my reasons for buying are pretty much unchanged from day one.
I don't see how he would be able to apply his methodology to BTC since what he does is very dependent on the company being listed publicly or at least having the ability to check the balance sheets. 
In my estimation much more value can be extracted from BTC for the users than where we are today. Meaning more use cases and a return of it's primary intended function with a couple of years more put into LN development. 
I don't think that's gambling really. That being said I am fine with it failing completely ... 
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:30:48
Of course they can fuck off. That is not the point. But my choice is still to put in some money with confidence that they will not do that. 
And it is not like companies are unchanging when it comes to human capital. Companies lose people all the time. 
Those are my reasons. Bitcoin is just an representation of that fact. Kind of like a share with no voting rights or direct dividends or rights to the underlying assets.

GL with running a full node though. 
Not impossible but there is a high barrier to entry last time I read about it...
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:56:42
Honestly this is not even misunderstanding bitcoin on a technical level. One of the core traits of bitcoin is immutability. Hell call it unchangeable and every lay person with a modest grasp of the English language will understand it. 
You don't need to understand the tech implementation to be able to understand that simple abstract concept.
