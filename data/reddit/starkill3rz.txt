thank you for sharing this intimate part of your life.  sorry never seems enough in these situations.  know that posting this might prevent someone from following the same path. at the vary least it is a cautionary tale to a lot of people.  
my thoughts will be with you and your family as i say my positive affirmations.

create a foundation in his name for a cause/subject he was interested in.  it's better than leaving it just sitting there.  it's not going to bring him back but good can come from bad.  
@_date: 2014-06-13 02:17:56
yeah...mine was three days ago :/
@_date: 2014-06-29 22:05:44
thank you for taking the time to investigate and post this.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:19:31
thank you for your response.  i remember in the early days people being able to use their graphics card to mine, but that was overtaken by asic.  i will check out the hardware comparison chart again.  it makes sense to go the gpu way to dip my toe in, so to speak.
thanks again for the info and time!
@_date: 2014-08-26 21:53:26
checks out.  you know the correct pronunciation.  
@_date: 2014-06-02 20:56:13
holy shit i cannot imagine your predicament.  i have a fraction of 1 btc in my wallet....let alone 800.  talk about first world problems.  
best of luck to your recovery of the coins.  i would help you out but my wallet is still (basically) empty. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 18:13:13
i'm so glad to hear you recovered them.  i also think it is wonderful how appreciative and gracious you have been.  there are some really good people in this community.  
i cannot fathom how you felt (and now feel) but then again i cannot fathom having 800btc.  best of luck to you and your wallet!

umm ....charlotte is the 2nd largest financial center.  
@_date: 2014-07-04 05:38:23
i should wear this to work on one of our casual dress days.
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:12:50
i will admit this is a stupid ? and feel free not to respond if you don't have the time.
when they say to use p2pool to help decentralize, you still need a physical miner...correct?  i briefly glanced at some instructions and they recommended a miner min. of 40 gh/s.  roughly how much do they currently go for?  
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:42:18
what a lovely thing to wake up to on a sunday.
@_date: 2014-04-16 21:18:54
let me check my wallet....
@_date: 2014-03-27 03:40:38
that is an amazing machine.  exceptional work. sure wish i had more in my wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:23:03
my interest in mining mainly resides in gaining a deeper understanding in btc and also contribute (albeit a small amount) something back.
thank you very much for the information.  
@_date: 2014-06-08 19:58:18
same here.  look back on that and wish i would have kept with it.  
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:46:32
under the FAQ they have a minimum recommendation of 40gh/s and i was wondering roughly what a miner would cost that would handle this?
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:11:00
"early enough to make me a millionaire."  
c'mon big money....no wammies no wammies
@_date: 2014-04-19 17:52:30
this is quite a neat idea.  very generous of you.  
i'm trying to hang in there.  
@_date: 2014-04-19 03:55:19
life.  that's my best joke.
@_date: 2014-05-30 15:40:24
what a lovely idea and gesture!  guess someday i should get a facebook.  friends first....facebook second.
@_date: 2014-08-21 17:15:21
or the WMC :)
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:39:04
wish i would have known about this a month ago.  still bookmarked.  thanks. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 23:49:54
thank you for your informative response.  looks like i have something new to familiarize myself with this weekend.
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:43:40
welcome to the bitcoin revolution.  hopefully.
@_date: 2014-09-29 16:43:56
sent my request months ago...no dice here either. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:40:39
does this happen once you have had an account with them for XXX amount of time?  
is this unrelated to having a cc on backup for instant buy?  sorry for the stupid ?'s
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:43:21
nice # to buy at indeed.
@_date: 2014-07-13 18:22:55
now only if we could use btc in some of the head shops in asheville.
@_date: 2014-12-22 20:05:11
go pack
@_date: 2014-01-16 22:33:11
they just talked about this on Around the Horn on ESPN.  Jackie McMullen (sp?) spent her face time explaining how the kings were the first team to accept bitcoin.  she went on to say that she had to look up what btc was, but another pablo torres knew of it as a way to buy coke.  go figure. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 18:33:10
thank you for taking the time to clue me in.  i had a rough couple of days and am running on fumes.  i am, by no means, an expert on btc.  i should have done some research before spouting off at the mouth.  
@_date: 2014-06-29 17:28:42
thank you for taking the time to write this up.  this is part of why i love the btc community so much.  looks like i am still waiting on my 30 days.
edit:  it actually looks like i don't have instantbuy bc i do not have a CC on file.   
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:26:03
how has your experience been doing so?
@_date: 2014-11-11 22:50:47
tumble your btc :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 01:15:25
done.  thanks for posting this.  
@_date: 2014-08-21 18:02:07
thing looks huge for dabs.  gonna be a flavor killer.
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:01:39
i didn't want to click the link to give it traffic, but i caved in.  the first webpage i ever coded back in the late 90s was 100X better than this piece of shit.  
love this part, "Professor Mark Thomas Williams of Boston University is an expert in bitcoin. A bitcoin expert."
redundant sentence is redundant.  fucking moron. 
edit:  i'm the fucking moron.  jokes on me.
@_date: 2014-07-07 03:26:36
i think a lot of people checked their coinbase wallet.  it was worth a refresh. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:58:10
wish this would have been going on last week to raise the price then.  i had to sell of my btc and now am already down 100+ 
i wanted to long hold, but life sometimes says otherwise.  time to rebuild.  
@_date: 2014-12-22 18:16:27
you were supposed to eat it, not smear it on the wall.  
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:00:06
yes i was looking to purchase a miner.  i have heard of those and will look into them further.  thank you.
@_date: 2014-06-04 17:40:58
i lack the passion and motivation....am i in a pile of shit by myself?

requested a beta invite months ago, but never got one.  signed up today and am pleased so far.  am awaiting acct verification and made my first transaction.  went so smooth i even posted on instagram about it.
@_date: 2014-10-22 17:55:39
my gut feeling this is really revolutionary.  the hope that this could really be a game changer.  the anonymity and control.  saying a big "fuck you" to the established financial system, of which i don't want to participate in.

40-50% markup guaranteed.  
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:21:03
i guess i did.  sorry.  been a long night. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 01:11:27
what a wonderful idea and very kind of you.  things like this that make me very hopeful for btc.  can't wait to see where this    cryptocurrency takes us.
@_date: 2012-08-01 03:26:17
the account was auto-generated, but no btc
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:07:12
Trying to get some kratom?
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:08:42
i was trying to place one transaction on my mobile ios and got an error and then the second time got no confirmation or any indication it went through, then i log onto my laptop and make a purchase.  guess what....all of them show up.  
their glitches today just cost me $ &amp; i'm pissed
