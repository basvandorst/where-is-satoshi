Facebook be like: 1) buy LiteCoin 2) only run adds on LiteCoin from there 3) ???? 4) Profit?
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:54:56
Hopefully this will boost BTC back up.
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:49:00
Heard they're going to try and acquire LiteCoin
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:30:30
K, well fuck you too then. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:31:08
Get out..
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:45:51
Not giving a shit about what some people are doing and then double backing on their decisions to "pull out of BTC/stop accepting BTC"?
Thanks? I think..
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:57:25
WTF is Stripe, and why should I care they stopped accepting BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:38:28
and then transfer to BTC via an exchange? Was looking at about 5k.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:19:09
Is it based on the purchasing orders? Also noticed selling has the same $100ish swing. Noob questions I know, still getting the hang of things.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:31:34
Thanks, I tried to go onto Gdax, but can't figure out where to pay with a CC or USD/Bank account to purchase.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:48:36
THANKS!!! MORE EDUCATION! :D I swear, since I officially 'got into crypto' I've been inhaling information on this. I've watched probably 5-6 hrs (a very conservative estimate) a day since 12/20-21.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:11:21
Right? mine's been in processing for over a week I think now.. :\
@_date: 2018-08-06 03:17:53
Well, there cars are pretty shit, so I'd rather buy a Lamborghini or a Mclaren 
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:46:22
Like the old Square Cash app?
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:30:26
Is coinbase still the best way to buy small amounts of BTC? I know a lot of people don't like CB.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:18:40
I'd say it was 'stabilizing'.
@_date: 2019-04-18 06:46:22
Dem zip ties tho..
@_date: 2019-04-30 02:47:37
Why do they charge to use a toilet?
@_date: 2019-04-30 02:47:29
Deposit inside.
@_date: 2018-02-28 06:01:40
price is now approaching 11k mark.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:49:22
All of my investments have nothing to do with that toolbox. It's not hard to see how full of shit he really is, people blindly following will and deserve to lose their money because they didn't do any research.
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:32:05
Could also be a ploy for the "state" to try and acquire as much BTC as possible in an attempt to control it. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:54:34
lol wut?
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:04:57
Next big barrier, especially psychologically, is the 10k mark, then its a run up to 15 and then 20k!
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:33:14
Currency, or any inanimate object for that matter, is Neutral, and a tool. Money isn't evil, its people's actions that  are being amplified by the tool to achieve their goals. 
More people need to put this into their world view and the world would make much more sense.
@_date: 2018-07-28 05:26:27
lel bot....
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:24:08
Also what idiot leftists look like when they're clinging to their crumbling foundation when you confront them with fact, logic and reason.
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:56:25
No, we don't need to talk about him. Anyone pushing a 'course' on Crypto is literally in it for the money only. Him, CryptoNick/RyanBlue, anyone doing this shit needs to just be ignored and not trusted. 
Granted some of my 1st video's I ever saw oh crypto were from Nick and Ryan and started my adventure/knowledge into Crypto, but as I've come so far, I don't trust them anymore. New knowledge changes the game.
Just ignore these twats, and let them die with Bitconnect.
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:05:05
Is this the asshole who's had control of that wallet and been dumping coins on the open market to crash it?
@_date: 2019-05-24 04:58:16
They just want an extra 'slice' of your crypto.
