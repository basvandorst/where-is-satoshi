Just FYI intentionally structuring financial transactions to avoid IRS notifications is a crime punishable by up to 5 years. In addition coinbase and all financial institutions are required to report transactions that add up to the reporting limit within a certain timeframe anyway.

Any/all? I would worry about us Gov specifically but any gov regulation would hurt the appeal and usefulness of crypto. If US or major European markets drop out I would expect the value of btc to drop hard and fast as well as the appeal. It could be as simple as US gov saying "you must provided annual accounting for BTC to IRS or you're a criminal" and most people outside of the financial sector are going to say "nah too complicated".

I am genuinely interested, what do you mean when you say right now it looks like if you can't beat em join em? Certainly it looks like crypto will be part of the financial landscape moving forward, but what does it look like? I'm sure there were early adopters of the automobile who raved about the freedom and utility compared to traditional transportation. "You can go as fast as you want, anyone can drive it, it can go anywhere, don't have to feed It, etc." At some point though gov came in and said "speed limits, license requirements, insurance, traffic cops, gas tax, etc." It seems to me that crypto is still likely in that stage right before the traffic lights go up.
