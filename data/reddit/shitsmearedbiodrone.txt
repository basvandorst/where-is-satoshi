What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in investment banking, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret trades, and I have over 300 confirmed sell offs. I am trained in market manipulation and I’m the top trader in the entire stock market. You are nothing to me but just another client. I will bankrupt you with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of day traders across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your credit history. You’re fucking in debt, kid. I can be any merchant, anytime, and I can trade with you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my flat currency. Not only am I extensively trained in investment banking, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the bitcoin mining bots, and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable credit history off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Your fucking credit is dead, kiddo.
