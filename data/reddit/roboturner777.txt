Peter is the perfect contrarian indicator.  As soon as he starts pounding the table, you know a top in gold and miners is in and a bottom in the USD.  Meanwhile the US stock market goes higher and higher and higher.  The opportunity cost being long commodities over the last 10 years vs the US stock market has been devastating, as I am sure Peter and his customers can attest.  Peter is selling nothing but a pipe dream to his customers who are down severely since 2000 (unless they had absolutely perfect timing and bought in January 2016 and not any time prior or after, or bought exclusively gold or silver metal at the lows in 2000 and no other commodities or resource stocks).

Just off the top of my head, this clown has incorrectly forecasted:
(1) The fed would start QE.  That starting QE would cause the USD to 
crash and U.S. stocks to crash.
(2) Wrong about oil.  Said it would not go below $100 every again.
(3) Wrong about gold.  Said $2000 was a "sure thing".
(4) Wrong about silver.  Still remember when it was at all times highs 
predicting next stop $500.  
(5) Wrong about the USD.  Next crisis everyone the USD would not be the 
safe haven.
(6) Said there was no money to be made investing in U.S. stocks.  
Everyone 1000 point gains in the DOW calling them "illusions".  Now he 
said he predicting the DOW would go up all along - lol. 
(7) Wrong about yields.  10 yield would never fall below 5%.  
(8) Hyperinflation before end of Obama's first term.  Predicted that on 
Glenn Beck - now says never said it.  
(9) Wrong about AUD, NZD, CAD (all these currencies have imploded).  
(10) Euro would not go below 1.30.  Has called for a Euro bottom about 
9000 times.
(11) 10 year would be over 10%.  
(12) The fed would not stop QE.  They did, now is on the more QE

PS has become a laughing stock. Peter was wrong on Gold, Crude, dollar, stocks,bond and now BC. Tell me one thing that he was right about. He asked people to buy Gold at $1800 crude at $120 dollars. He said to short dollar index at 73. Today Gold is at 1270, crude  stocks near lifetime high and dollar index 94. Biggest joke was that he said Gold will go to $5000 dollars and crude 220 dollars lol

I have followed Schiff since his Wall Street Unspun days way back in 
2007-08. This guy is all about money. I remember him bashing Bitcoin at 
like $18 a coin on his Peter Schiff show saying it was a bubble when he 
missed the previous one and Thomas Woods said how interesting it was. 
Also countless people called in back then asking Schiff should I buy a 
home the market has dropped like crazy!! Schiff said it was a horrible 
investment while he bought not 1 but two homes and that it was cheaper 
to rent. While RENT HAS SKYROCKETED!!!! He said if you do it then take 
out the biggest fixed rate loan you can get, this wave of inflation will
 be so much your postage stamp for your payment will be less than your 
mortgage!! I wish I was making this up. Yet this clown tanks his clients
 and goes on TV claiming he is more right than anyone else. At EuroPac 
my position would be down 50% and they would say well its still on our 
buy list and bunch of b.s. about value creation etc. Then why is it 
tanking? Its all bull shizzle. Schiff  priority is to depart your from
 your money at any cost.﻿

Peter Schiff has been wrong at the top of his lungs for decades. He may have predicted the mortgage crisis of 2008, but he's had his head up his canal ever since. He's predicted 29 of the last zero global collapses, along with Weimar-style hyperinflation unknown outside Glenn Beckistan. We're still waiting on that one.
The old gold bulls are never going to like bitcoin. It puts them out of business. As long as Peter Schiff and Rick Rule and the other gilded dinosaurs are peddling gold bricks to the faithful, bitcoin will be more of a threat than a promise.

Peter Schiff has lost a lot of good people a ton of money, that is the real story here. 
Reasons Why Peters Clients Are Bailing:
1) Peter keeps moving the goal posts. Back in 2010-2011, he was saying we had months until the collapse. Then he said It would collapse on Bernankes watch. Then he said there was no way Obama would survive 2 terms without a collapse. Now he says its definitely happening in Trumps first term. 
Peters clients have correctly figured out that Peter has no clue as to when the market will turn. His credibility is non-existent.
2) He charges close to 5% commissions on purchazing and exiting stock positions. On a $100,000 in stock, thats $5,000!!!!!! At Scottrade, I can buy + sell $100,000 in stock for about $15.
3) Peter calls his precious clients "morons" and "idiots" the moment they close their accounts with him. This fact speaks to his character. These are people that trusted him, invested with him and subsequently lost alot of money with him over many tears. Theyre morons for wanting to try something different than losing money?? And whats with the name calling?? You make it very obvious that your "clients" are merely ATMs to you that only deserve decency / respect when they are dispensing money.
4) This is just speculation, but  I have to assume Peters Brokers see the writing on the wall and I suspect that some of them are bailing too. The whole situation is feeding off of itself in a negative death spiral.﻿ Just look at Euro Pac's Glassdoor and Yelp reviews, Schiff's ship is sinking
