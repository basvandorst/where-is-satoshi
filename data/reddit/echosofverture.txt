I have been finding a lot of these on exploited windows servers. Is this box running cold fusion?
@_date: 2014-11-04 00:57:50
So you would be buying fishing hooks and bubble gum? 
@_date: 2014-09-22 18:08:01
Nm see it is
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:19:12
I can hook you up as my grandparents have some. What version do you require and how much btc will it pay?
@_date: 2014-08-14 06:59:39
Should he ride the btc to the store? 
@_date: 2014-08-27 07:22:57
He is free right? At least it got the word out about him in a time when twitter and facebook did not exist. I also do not think Ross has a community as large and supportive as  was back then.  If I recall, did they also try to spread propaganda about that case as well?

Whoa my funds showed up 20 minutes after posting this. Still took 4+ hours. The named should be changed to bitsoonish. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 09:14:02
From the site: Convert your moneypaks into bitcoins with fees as low as 20%. Seems like a lot. 
@_date: 2013-02-26 00:28:26
Been waiting for bit instant to get their shit together so I may try this.

whoa you sell parts for the vape q extreme. may have to hit you up as I need filters but you do not see the whip?  
@_date: 2013-02-17 17:19:24
Odd my account has extra btc. 
@_date: 2013-02-28 16:16:27
Maybe this is why they canceled my order last night and have not replied to my support ticket. I do not understand how their fraud filters kick in 5 minutes before the coin is scheduled to go into my wallet. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 21:34:11
Nfc tag implanted under the skin would be cooler. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:26:24
Maybe I got lucky? Their ordering system must be over loaded. I wanted to buy this morning when it was at $75 but that did not happen. 
@_date: 2013-02-25 22:04:33
Go to the back alley ask for Bruno. Bring cash and come alone. 
@_date: 2013-01-23 16:47:56
You really made 100BTC? 
@_date: 2013-01-25 21:38:11
wow that is cool. I did not know this existed. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:38:37
The funds in Cyprus were donated. Kind of like gox taking btc out of accounts to pay for upgrades.
@_date: 2013-03-23 18:07:37
This happened to me a few weeks ago and they took the extra btc back. 
@_date: 2013-02-06 19:01:14
I use bitusenet and it is a very good usenet service with a high completion rate on posts. I would recommend them. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:01:30
Down for me as well.
@_date: 2013-01-25 20:55:35
Are these real bitcoins that you can spend? If so how do you spend them? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:14:47
Wtf is he going to do steal my private key?
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:26:56
Thinking of buying in the morning. I thought it was going to fall hard but seems to be hoovering around 100
@_date: 2013-04-15 01:58:41
I used my user name last time as well. Your mtgox number in at the top of the page.
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:32:46
How many btc for a ride in your magic time machine? 
@_date: 2013-02-21 20:42:16
You can get a real girl for that price. Is the price of your service automatically tied to usd so if btc triples in price it will adjust. 
@_date: 2013-02-16 02:55:18
Is that why they have been having issues lately? 
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:03:32
It's cool I verified it. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 13:26:51
Check out tiny tiny rss which runs on your own server.

I already had btc in my Coinbase account that I was trying to send to someone. The transaction has been pending for 12 hours and no reply to my support ticket.
