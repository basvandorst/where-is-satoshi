Yep, I got it too... Oh well, this sucks.
This happened to a friend of mine a few months ago too (not exactly the same, but something close to this as far as I remember), unfortunately it was too late when he discovered the mail and his account was frozen (I think it remained that way for about a month) and they notified him only 24 hours prior to this. Needless to say he lost a lot of his profits.
But I already got mine out so alls' good here :P
Edit: I've actually heard some horror stories about people not being able to successfully verify their accounts and not getting their bitcoins back EVER after that.

Hey everybody,
 Qt Bitcoin Trader is an open source application that helps you to place and cancel Mt.Gox and BTC-e orders very fast, with real time data monitoring and detailed information.
I've been working on this open source project for a while and it has been going very well. Over time, with the help of bitcointalk community, Qt Bitcoin Trader has evolved into a stable and reliable trading platform. It's available in English, Russian, Ukrainian, Spanish, Dutch, Norwegian and German. With the latest update support for btc-e has been added, now you can trade litecoins too!.
Developed on pure Qt, uses OpenSSL. Api key and secret are protected by password using AES 256 encryption.
I would really like to hear some feedback, suggestions and criticism regarding Qt Bitcoin Trader.
