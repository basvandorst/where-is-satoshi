As a community we should make one if one doesn't exist yet.
It'd also be nice to see some insight discussing how to handle the taxation of them as well.

500 error right now for me, but this sounds more like what I want. I'll check back later.
I want a replica of Google Reader. Not these fancy flipboard-esque things that keep popping up all over news sites as "Google Reader alternatives"

I'd also guess that right now some people are willing to take on zero fee transitions to muster support for the currency.

Running Mac OS 10.8.3 and bitcoin-qt 0.8 up until reading this post, now running 0.8.1 just fine. 
It sounds like something got corrupted in the upgrade process. I would suggest just grabbing your wallet.dat file and blowing away everything else and redownloading the blockchain.

I would agree with this. I sold some digital goods (which I know is a bad idea on ebay, but I needed some cash) and had a buyer claim they never recieved the item. ebay won't listen to you at all in cases like these.
I could easily see a seller taking advantage of this and saying the buyer never paid and if you showed them a bitcoin receipt they'd be like, "wtf is this?"

This is odd to me. I needed some cash so I took a risk and sold some legitimate digital goods on ebay and one of the buyers was allowed to reverse the transaction claiming they never got the item.
Unless the policies have changed very recently your request should've been honored because they would have no shipping information to prove that they sent you anything.
I would try again via ebay and if you used a credit card via PayPal I would call them and see if they can help you out.
