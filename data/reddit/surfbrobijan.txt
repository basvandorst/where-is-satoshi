i THINK it has to do with that one movie where the black kid from high school accidentally gets ecstasy pills in a bag switch with his backpack, meanwhile he wants a Harvard letter of recommendation from a investment banker who is basically becomes in charge of distributing drugs to makeup for money lost in losing the investment banker's cocaine. In order for the black kid to do the dirty work without being traced he ends up sending bitcoins to the investment banker, meanwhile having a caviot that shows proof of the address he sent to belonging to the investment banker in case the black kid gets blackmailed.
