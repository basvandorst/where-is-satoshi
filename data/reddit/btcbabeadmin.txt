its time people like you SHUT THE FUCK UP
@_date: 2014-05-31 03:54:41
thats a good argument in favor of it, and so is being able to tip people that dont currently have bitcoin or you dont know their address.  however I think its worth paying the bitcoin network a fee and avoiding any middlemen.. its more in the spirit of the coin.

@_date: 2014-05-29 21:50:21
but they can't steal the money like that
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:55:09
I think its pretty cool that with just posting a string of text I can receive instant payment from anywhere in the world.  
@_date: 2014-06-10 20:09:22
it sounds like a scam to me.. imaginary "features" that are just bitcoin things... and disappearing coins after u pay 10,000$ for the "privilege" of being a money launderer 
@_date: 2014-12-21 10:12:16

mebbe bitcoin is BETTER because it has a competeting business model built from scratch that has LESS built in fees.
what is up with all these legacy loving shills on this board lately?
@_date: 2014-06-14 01:15:25
two thirds of a percent ? 
@_date: 2014-05-31 04:57:42
Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of changetip for newbies and for showing off on reddit, but I'm just saying at a certain point I like to get tipped directly rather than retrieve it from a bot.

bitcoin still has time to be the best investment of 2014 at the last minute and ruin everyone's magazine articles!!
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:34:50
