wouldn't COLD be required to know the list of input transactions to pick the ones required in the transaction?

Hi duduqa, just to make it clear, are you looking for bitcoins or for bitcoin options?
As I understood it is the second option but the answers seem to handle the first option.

haha, conseguiu comover o duduqa, ele respondeu lá na outra mensagem :-)

Hi fisker, thanks for offering help.
We were able to find someone who helped him. As far as I know they are doing business since then without any problems but  it's been some time since I last talked to the guy in need of help.
Anyways, it is good to know about you and if anyone else asks me I will have your contacts to provide.
Thanks again

In this case it would be better to use egifter and receive the cashback

I have a service like this in the portuguese section of bitcointalk. Fixed income in brazil pays around 0.85% per month but Banks charge people around 6% for the same time period. 
My terms are 1.9% per month and bitcoin prices have a discount of 30% while being considered as garantee. 
Bitcoins are sent to a paper wallet and not moved until the deadline. 
It happened already of the garantees do not cover the entire money lent. The borrower fullfil his promisse and payed the debt. Even if he doesnt prices went up shortly after and would have covered the debt. Anyway that risk was accounted for in the interests already.

Thanks anyway Shuai.
I got no response yet, but I think the time I posted the message didn't help because of the timezone in Angola.
Let's see how things go today. I will post here in case we have any luck.

Grande Duduqa, parabéns pela iniciativa!!
Um abraço de Curitiba, terra que só aparece no jornal quando tem a menor temperatura do brasil ou quando o doleiro presta depoimento :-)

Hi... just passing by to join the team of the ones who run full nodes without problems.
I run four nodes, one of them on a vps and none of them have any problem like yours. 
The vps one stops from time to time (maybe once a month) due to memory limitations and a few other processes running on the same server. In this case a simple restart brings it back (no reindex required).
I would also bet on some sort of disk error.

did you noticed the file have 26039 duplicated lines? 
It has actually 98769 unique private keys.
I agree with the wordlist would be much better for research purposes

You should check 
Their exchange project is open-source but they have built a business model in which they offer technical/business support while establishing exchanges around the world in order to reach the remittance market.
I know they already have exchanges working in Brazil, Chile, Venezuela, Pakistan and are dealing with another countries (not sure about Israel - maybe a business opportunity?).
disclaimer: Although I don't know them in-person, blinktrade's founder, as well as the owners of the Brazilian exchange (Foxbit) are members of the portuguese community at bitcointalk.org so I have some contact with them.

Is there any chance your car fixes itself automagically after that?
I think people say that regarding bitcoin because their value can return to the previous state unless they sell it (or until it is definitely dead).

I just discovered they do not provide the points for international purchases, so no point in buying from them outside the USA. I am posting it here for the people who search for it before using in the future.

They offer Amazon giftcards for most of the european countries, but they won't  give you point on these purchases.
I just discover it after spending around £700 with them.
[Here is the post I made about it](
Did you get any point when using euro or pounds with their giftcards ?

RemindMe! 2 years "bought 191 btc for 325k 2 years ago."

In my understanding when (or if, as the ones who don't believe it would say) bitcoin achieves an important amount of any fiat currency usage (lets say higher than 50% of it), than it will be the other way around and things will be priced in bitcoins and automatic converted into dollars, euros or any other fiat currency.
This is supposed to happened on a per-currency basis in my opinion and places like argentina, where the government strongly manipulates the fiat, can be the first ones to see it happening if it is easy to the average joe to use it.
