Not really, sorry. Same transaction or not if I have less $ at the end doesn't that mean I've lost that amount?

So what is your answer to the second part of the question?

No you're explaining very well, I just fell you don't really include "eventually" side in your answers. Can it go forever with everybody making profit?

I may be retarded or may be 12, or maybe a 12 yo retard. But is this a good reason for you to be rude?

Gold is not man-made. If you find a $100 bill on the ground doesn't that mean somebody lost it?

Not really about ponzi scheme. I just want to understand what it is. Let's just say as of now nobody wants to buy bitcoin anymore, and will not buy again forever. Doesn't that mean -basically- people who made money took the money of the ones who loose money?

If the price drops and I sell for $10000 then yes I did loose $5000. Your scenario only works if the price never drops ever.

New owner is satisfied because he will use the car, but new bitcoin owner can only be satisfied with profit, and the next owner also, then the newt owner...

So unless there will be unlimited buyers who will pay more and more money for the bitcoin it is not possible for everybody to make a profit from it. It is a timing game to find out who will find a seat when the music stops?
