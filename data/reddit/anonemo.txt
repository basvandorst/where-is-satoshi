This would be a step forward but AFAIK there is no problem with the quality of drugs sold on these markets, and if the vendor knows who's the test buyer he will simply send his best undiluted product while saving the rest mediocre batch for addicts, but of course this can be solved by changing addresses etc, but it does not matter, because:
The overall quality of illegal drugs is much better on these markets than on the street.
The main problem is the FE scam, like [Tony76's case]( or [here]( or [here] ( where an established vendor with great feedback made a sale, asked for FE, then vanished with all the money.
Or sheep marketplace where allegedly the admin of the marketplace took off with all the money.
I like the idea of a decentralized marketplace and there are already some implementations [Bit-Wasp]( [Open transactions]( but seems like no one wants to use one, maybe because there is no entity behind it, there's noone to believe in
And even Tor is too hard for most druggies, not to mention a decentralized self managed p2p market.
Oh and IIRC [TheAvengers]( did something similar with LSD vendors, testing their blotters and tabs in a lab.
