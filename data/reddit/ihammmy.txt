I'm guessing its something to do with the fork. My Nano S is still showing my coins, but it is saying they are worth $0. Give it a few hours :)
@_date: 2017-01-02 13:41:59
What's that? 
@_date: 2017-01-08 11:34:11
I didn't have BTC at the time, but yes, I lost access to all of my accounts that did not provide me with a backup code
@_date: 2017-01-08 11:33:32


Google don't provide you with backup codes...

@_date: 2017-01-02 14:40:52
Good idea.  Thanks 
@_date: 2017-01-06 23:29:14
google removed this feature
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:13:00
Why did you keep it all on them sites? Just curious 
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:58:34
I think they handled something like 70% of BTC transactions until they closed down. Shit loads of people lost shit loads of money
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:46:56
I backup my phone aswell, but i'm not sure if that will also backup the google authenticator app
@_date: 2017-01-06 23:17:00
I don't see why people even bother asking these questions... If everyone knew the answer to this, everyone would be millionaires
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:46:30
I called up Google support when the same situation happened to me. I was told be multiple people that there is nothing I could do to retrieve the old Authenticator entries. I just had to make new accounts or enter one of the backup codes provided by the account

Why do people still use coinbase? I heard their prices arent even good
@_date: 2017-01-08 11:39:31


How are you meant to save them?
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:11:19
Why would you keep them on Coinbase? Have you never heard of the Mtgox story?!
@_date: 2017-01-06 23:29:45
this isnt actually true. I have had the same issue as OP multiple times and you just have to do a fresh start and create new accounts etc
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:36:31
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:13:13
how long did it take you to cut out that graph
@_date: 2017-01-08 11:35:00
that is a good idea

Looks like german version was just copy &amp; pasted...

Thanks for the info. But I still don't understand that if the wallet is only used to hold keys, where is the actual value of my address stored? Is it the ledger? Thanks again!!

What does hodl even mean?
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:48:35
What would your class  as a small investment?
@_date: 2017-01-07 11:52:13
Thanks, i'll do this later. I normally just backup my phone on Google Drive
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:37:33


Thanks for all the info.
If I were to change my wallet to another company from Electrum, could I use my seed words to get back into my wallet? For example, is my Electrum wallet only available on Electrum or can it be used with other wallet programs? Thanks again!!
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:52:30
No sound :(

@_date: 2016-12-28 20:39:03
dont b lazy
@_date: 2016-12-29 10:35:34
buy it?...
@_date: 2016-12-28 18:36:03
Thanks! It all makes sense now.
One thing though. Are private keys needed to receive payments? When I bought my bitcoin I only needed to provide the address, which has seemingly changed now.
@_date: 2016-12-29 12:58:04
Malwarebytes wouldn't even let me on the site
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:43:31
Thanks. So if Electrum shut down for any reason my coins would be lost?
@_date: 2016-12-28 14:37:41
Thanks :)
@_date: 2016-12-29 20:24:10
its not me but you seem very arrogant 
@_date: 2016-12-29 10:17:33
2 hours left

The fees are only low right now because of relatively low buys/sells (compared to the past few months). If bitcoin ever goes up in price as fast as it did in November, then boom - extremely high transaction fees again
