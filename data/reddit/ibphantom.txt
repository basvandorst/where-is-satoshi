When are you gonna realize that they don't care? They've been given ample time to catch back up on public relations. Move your hodlings and purchases somewhere else.

But then if you're Australian, you start losing?

It's a joke. If you had read any of the other posts on this sub, you would've gotten that. Did you not read? The articles he reads tell him that the government will freeze his assets, so he believes it. The article tells him that there's no cap, he believes it. He's informed on the math involved with the security, but not the laws on it because there's no current laws on crypto currency.

I'm sorry your father doesn't love you enough to joke around with you. He's my stepdad and we've been through enough drug addiction recovery issues together to be able to joke about laughing at each other.
@_date: 2018-09-08 18:18:50
Yeah, except this isn't shit that you don't need. Cryptocurrency is useful.

I've been messing with bitcoins since 2013, sorry if I sound noobish to you, what are you gaining from commenting this? Answer the question I asked originally at least. Why would you sound demeaning to any brother or sister interested in Bitcoin. You're the real cringe of the community.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:05:45
He is informed. Read the title. You're assuming he is some nobody that I met on the street, him and I have a relationship. He makes really good money and is afraid of his bank being frozen, not the aspect of it's legitimacy. He's afraid it'll crash because governments will freeze people's assets and force people out, not because they'll give up on it for other reasons. I may sound like a shill, but we have that kind of jokey relationship because we can communicate properly. I'm not gloating, I'm having a nice day and in a good mood; Sorry you're in a bad mood and can't appreciate someone else's nice day/conversation. Cheer up and answer the question. What should I bet?
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:18:31
Thanks for shilling. Have a nice day.

I think you misread. I mean spamming the news outlets to get them to think a lot of people want to see more on Bitcoin, which drives the news to cover more articles on Bitcoin. It pushes people to do research on Bitcoin because we pushed the media to cover it more.
@_date: 2018-09-08 18:19:19
Desperate for BTC to be mainstream instead of always being pushed aside and laughed at, yeah.

Why are you not double checking before sending 12k somewhere?
They should try to work with you, but in the end, its your fault for not knowing what address you're sending to.
If I'm setting up direct deposit for a new job, I'm going to be sure that I put down the correct routing and account number.
@_date: 2014-10-18 04:52:12
Yeah, but haven't you seen movies where the government claims that you are no longer on U.S. territory, so the constitutional rights don't apply there?
What do you do if you find yourself in that situation?
@_date: 2018-06-18 01:44:43
At work, I would put Vaseline on a quarter and put it in the intersection if two aisles. It was hilarious watching people pick it up.

It's not September yet
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:42:27
I still don't understand why anyone would buy anything but BTC. Anything else that's splits off is a gimmick.

This is the kind of stuff that scares me. I want to get into linux and I understand port forwarding(networking in general) quite well, but all the code makes me weary of trying because I don't want to mess anything up. Is there not any easy flash of this?
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:42:57
It's because they know that if they acknowledge Bitcoin, they'd have to acknowledge blockchain as a valid form of secure voting, which would significantly impact elections.

How does the deposit work? Is it a touch screen where you type your wallet number in?
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:26:03
You'd think those government officials would catch on and start making super clusters and mine for themselves. Of course, they probably do take the miners computers and use them anyways for all we know.
@_date: 2017-07-31 03:41:46
Why? My wallet is a physical coin. I put in nfc for tap to pay transfer/private keys. It looks cool and makes people ask more about bitcoin when they see it.
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:05:52
My friends are buying me bitcoin on my birthday, so something will be happening with bitcoin on August 1st.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:34:01
What's stopping someone who is wealthy from buying 51% of bitcoin and causing their own inflation?

Did you see how the Hansa site looked and probably still looks?
