Most likely greed. Take the chance on a penny stock hoping to get rich and go broke. That's kind of how bitcoin works right now. Everyone is taking the chance that it's the future, but so many things could still supplant that idea.

That's the thing. Bitcoin community can't figure out what's it's for. Is it remittance, business transactions, a store of value, or a global currency?
Also, you never stated how Bitcoin is an object of barter, but legos aren't. No one has really adopted it just as no one has adopted legos for bartering. Care to explain?

Yes, they sell upscale real estate in NYC. They are actual real estate agents. Some tech nerd guy did the bitcoin calculations to the asking price of a property then gave a verbal bid to the agent. Some time later, who knows how long, and the sellers lawyer called the agent and implied that's the dumbest thing ever. Even worse was bitcoin lost value I guess and was now a million dollars under the listing price. I think it boiled down to the seller was mad at the agent for considering it, and the buyer was probably just trolling them.

Okay, paper money. That's what they want. Call it Monopoly money because it doesn't matter. They don't want bitcoins. They want paper money backed by their government/economy to do business. If they don't want credit cards then why would they want internet tokens? You can't buy anything with those. You went sixteen blocks and got a cup of coffee, hooray! 
Except I don't think anyone takes those tokens in Greece. A much larger problems loom for them. I'm sure Cyprus was a good example.

I went to dinner with a good friend. She started talking about bitcoin forever while we ate and asked me what I think. I told her it's a neat technology, but it's not economically feasible as a currency.
She got mad and asked for her bill while yelling at me that I don't know what I'm talking about. Maybe I don't...until, the checks came and I paid mine. She started raging at the waiter because they said she couldn't pay in bitcoins. She had no cash or credit card. I got out of there fast with a sad laugh. I think at that point she was arguing with the manager over how to pay.

How, do I need some kind of BTC middle man? Something that would technically be a bank or a lender because the loan would have to be accountable by law. Or you can just lend me 1000btc for a home right now and I'll just freely walk away.
@_date: 2015-06-18 12:54:16
Bitcoin is limited because it doesn't have anywhere near the market or ability to make transactions on the level of a credit card company. There is a zero chance in hell that any economy could be currently functional with bitcoin.
It can't do a single one of those things at one time, let alone all of them at once. No capacity because the community is tiny. It's a fraction of a fraction in usage or user base. Most don't even barter with bitcoins. They just HODL until the price goes up, but now it's dropped down. Oh, the volatility.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:50:52
No one should be 100%. You've got to diversify yo bonds like Wu-Tang Financial. Learn to invest properly. You don't just push everything in one or two boats. As it stands, Bitcoin isn't looking too favorably. Any measure you would use on a stock would tell you to sell.

Then they couldn't buy anything. Greece relies on cash. They don't care about credit cards or crypto currencies. Cash is king. It gets you anywhere and anything you want if you have it.

Huh? I could pay you with legos if you acccepted. They have value. Same as bitcoin. Most everyone in the world won't accept legos or bitcoin as a form of payment though. They both get exchanged for fiat like any business that ever accepts bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:00:27
Uhhh, they don't accept Bitcoin. They are cash driven. Pay me Euros or get lost. Now that belief is even stronger. Economically they have much larger problems that Bitcoin can't solve. People aren't paying taxes and export to import rate really sucks. There is no one time fix-all thing.
If Greece adopted Bitcoin it would be about one transaction a person per month. Not going to happen.
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:38:22
I think he's just bitching about having to be his own bank while having to use a middle man. It may not be as easy as it appears. I don't know if it's growing pains or a failure in the system. There is a reason banks and markets exist.
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:41:21
Too many variables. I think people were upset about their treatment back in the 60's. You can still find veal in most grocery stores, but beef is cheaper. We like big steaks, ribs, brisket, and burgers.
It might just be capitalism at work. Why kill a baby cow when I can get more meat off of a grown cow that is prepacked and ready to sell? Lamb is harder to find and even more expensive. Veal and lamb are usually only served at expensive restaurants.
@_date: 2015-06-18 11:13:11
You tried to compare the $USD to Bitcoin by saying it's a competitor. They aren't in the same realm. In case you missed the point, if Bitcoin can't compete with Legos then it certainly can't compete with the dollar.

Short-sighted and eternal optimists until the day it dies. Everything is a chance for Bitcoin to make it big, but miraculously it never catches a foothold anywhere.
I'm pretty sure Greece is more worried about negotiations and the looming depression they might face. Churches and other groups right now have set up soup kitchens to feed people. The last thing they care about is some volatile remittance experiment to sink them further.

I dislike my short repsonse to your well written post, but are you suggesting we just allow money laundering? In a perfect world laws would stop things we deem bad and that obviously isn't the case. So they are in place to make things more difficult, hinder, and hopefully punish, in some form, those that do bad things like smuggling illegal profits from illegal activities.
You can't stop anything, but it's better to try than not. Perhaps just let everyone sell kids to sex rings and others to shoot up heroin? Free will. Have at it. No more laws and now we'll live in a perfect world? 
I don't agree with every law. I do know for a fact that the laws make things more challenging to accomplish. And the system....that will be corrupt no matter what. It's built into human nature. So what do you suggest; let people be as they wish? It sounds like you are suggesting anarchy.

I don't think I can help you on understanding why money laundering is bad for everyone. Your mind is made up. It's an activity that encourages very heinous things. Weapons, terrorism, sex slaves, illegal immigrants, drugs, tax evasion, robbery, and pretty much any single thing someone would want to do to skirt our laws. It's a way to shuffle money around to hide whatever illegal things that are being done. Are all laws bad?

Your best bet is the core manifesto principles in that it's evolving software to make things more secure, and we need more customer collaboration to accept bitcoin.
I wouldn't do it though. I don't think most people care because they paid for everything with their credit card or cash. Bitcoin has had no function in most of their lives. You can only talk about how it's developmental software to introduce a new way to pay for things. If you gave me a $1 bitcoin then you just threw that money away.

America isn't some fascist state. You simply explain why you have this money and what it's meant for. If they are still confused they can call someone to confirm. This isn't complicated. Police don't think everyone that has money on them is some kind of drug dealer. You are being over dramatic.
Edit: Oh, and the police were so evil they let me call my boss to tell him I don't have the cash to open up shop and I'm in jail. You need a new lead man to open for today. Those bastards!

There seems to be two parties now. Stay at a 1mb limit or move to an 8mb limit. Keeping it at 1mb limits the expansion. Putting it up to 8mb increases use, but could cause some potential security problems or make things seem more centralized. It's all centralized now though. 
Some devs and mods want to keep the lower level where they have more control and can keep making bank. Other devs feel there is a need to move things forward instead of sticking with old corrupted roots.

This is terribly wrong. China sold off some US treasury bonds so they could buy up the yuan to stop it from plunging. Also, they wanted to float the yuan after devaluation to see what would happen. As for buying lots of gold that's not what the market indicators are saying. They may buy around the same amount as last year 900+ tons. It's economically more difficult for China right now to buy more gold with Yuan and stock market troubles. If their economic woes continue downward they will actually buy less gold.

It's like they had a half-assed idea without any direction. So throw it to the public, ask them to pay for it, and figure out how they can force micropayments onto the market.
@_date: 2015-09-24 08:47:53
Because 21inc says that they feel regular payments(credit card, cash, etc.) work well for buying physical goods. Bitcoin is only good for micropayment type systems for digital purchases. [It's right there in their FAQ.](
So if you want to buy actual things then stick with what is widely accepted. That's the 21inc way.

Could you just keep all this bullshit in private emails? Kids bickering and gossiping doesn't really seem relevant. Hell, it's not important to a damn thing except your own personal matters.
@_date: 2015-09-09 22:48:37
Of course you'd say Blockstream. You shill from the mountain tops for them.

It's not illegal yet so they can sell it to recoup costs. Just pause for a second and think before you type.

You can't send them money. You can send cryptocurrency which they need to liquidate into local fiat somehow. Tell Western Union or PayPal they are doing things wrong because their business model is kicking ass. Bit Coin isn't even a tenth of PayPal's market cap.

It was justified because it was legal. If the laws change then it is no longer allowed. You are confused about basic things. Go read some books instead of the garbage on here.

Fact 1: Lightning networks still don't exist for a good reason.

These advertisements get bumped right up to the front page. I wonder if they are taking bitcoins or cash.
@_date: 2015-10-18 15:21:26
Sounds like you are talking about Liquid now.

So bitcoin loves idea men, but you seem to be too far forward thinking. I like it.

Attempt to make fun of banks. Need banks to use to Bitcoin. What do?

This sub would be a bad advertisement for bitcoin though.

Bitcoin discussion is bad enough on this subreddit. Now your masterlords are up to it and you get your jollies. Have a look at your main developers acting like amateurs instead of getting shit done. There is competition out there hard at work.
@_date: 2015-10-13 10:36:54
Only if companies use them. Blockstream like any company isn't just doing things out of the goodness of their heart.

It's a bit too late for that. Most of the rational people have fled and/or cashed out. Now you are left with mostly people on the fringe that have probably taken losses in Bitcoin. That makes things emotional for many here. 
You've got the ancaps that want to watch the world burn because they think bitcoin will take over economies. The dreamers know it will go big because they also want to become rich without having to do anything. Rarely will you find technical discussions without them devolving into silly political dev wars.
The real problem is Bitcoin hasn't been going anywhere, but down. There used to be fervor over the price everyday. Now I think it's a sub rule not to talk about price.

With the Blockchain using BitCoin.
@_date: 2015-10-04 15:00:12
Yeah, I mean there might be some problems with Bitcoin. If there are any feasible fixes it just might be hard to do. Things are working out fine if we can just get past all these bugs that pop up. Not a big deal anyway unless a group fully exploits things. Ehh, the math is solid.
@_date: 2015-10-08 08:43:14
Let me guess, this is a "feature" of Bitcoin for now. If something can be easily exploited then it's broken.
"...the fact that a networkwide attack on the Bitcoin network could be carried out by a bored individual with some coding skills, is probably quite telling in itself."

The article basically begs to please not regulate Bitcoin or it will be dead.
