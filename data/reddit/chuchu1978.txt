Rumor is there is a fork tomorrow. Supposedly a 1 fo1 deal with a bonus if you hold btc

The market bounce is starting. There is a lot of volume in the alt coins which means people are looking for the fork to transfer value from the btc to the new alt coin just as in bitcoin cash. The charts show that bitcoin did not lose 2-3k they show it was a value transfer downstream to bitcoin cash. Those values are an inverse of each other until the stabilization is complete

If it is absolutely necessary to be paid in btc. 
First set up you wallet and go through the verification process. Set up you wire transfer information in the wallet. Do a practice transfer back and forth with the bank to assess fees.
The next step is have them convert the bitcoin to dollars in the exchange and send that to your virtual wallet.

Coinbase has been holding my bank deposit hostage since 12/21 it cleared with the bank 12/23. Interestingly enough it does not clear due to Coinbase issues until 12/29 which is curiously after the fork... the fix is in fellas.

Flat screens of the same size have different resolution but the higher the quality the higher the price. So if I can buy the cheapest I am happy because I get a brand name. Every time you watch the cheaper TV you wonder what the more expensive one looks like and save to purchase as it demands the higher price. So if there are enough cheaper bitcoins, the original has to be worth it.

8 days bank transfer in for me

So your money is tied up and losing value..

Maybe more it depends how much of a% bitcoin loses to new crypto. New money is not the source of investment as we can see with the delayed wire transfers. It is the conversion of bitcoin to the newer bitcoin.

Yes the Segwit2x is tomorrow and at least 2 other people in this thread have old transfers that finish post fork

It all depends on your tax planning for the current year. The main question is if you still have the money you took out. If you have spent it, you are screwed. There are options to minimize but you have to pay the taxes at some point. BTW you are going to cry when you get your bill from your tax accountant since this is new plan on them taking you through the coals.

It’s ironic how they want bitcoin to replace ACH in some way yet one of the major coin “houses” takes 2 weeks to process a transaction. Credit Cards go right through so I surmise they are hiding behind and blaming banks for the delay so the can hold the fiat and profit from it.

This is a price fix. Create multiple lesser currencies to substantiate the value of the top of the line. This creating a tiered purchasing system much like you would see in an electronics store. If you create coins that are available at multiple purchase thresholds much like a tv you can substantiate bitcoins current and future worth based off of scarcity.

You are correct MP the problem is I have a large sum of money being held hostage and no extra fiat to bring in before the fork through a different company.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:19:00
Actually yes you are not alone. Coinbase has been holding onto my wire transfer for 8 days even after my bank has verified completion. They do not have customer service so you may be screwed like me. They may be holding funds due to the bitcoin fork tomorrow to maximize returns

Bitcoin fork planned for 12/28

You are so correct, but it’s sad. They must have known about the fork and bonus and the preemptive move was to stockpile people’s fiat and capture the return under the guise of a crashed system. It’s genious!!

I was actually transferring money in. With the fork if my transaction is not posted I will miss out on the 1 for 1 and extra bonus bitcoin. I suppose since Coinbase already secured the purchase on their end they will keep the currency bonus while holding my trade hostage
