Until everybody starts to "cash out" and just crashes the price

Come back in a couple days so I can tell you I told you so.

Deposit money to coinbase and then purchase off GDAX. You won't be charged with fees as long as you purchase with a limit order. Your coinbase account is linked with GDAX.

Rip when it goes back to 20k Monday night

If your parents want it back, give them what you owe and keep the rest in. (If you don't need the rest of that money)

Until the 10th and 18th, and the Wales dump all the BTC and $$$$$$ easy money
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:59:40
The Whales and people just now starting to hear of BTC and the "profits" so they're all buying at ATHs and pumping it along with them.

You can keep it on the exchange, but it's recommend to use a wallet. It'll keep your btc secure.

I believe it was the fee from purchasing.

Once the Wales short sell BTC it's going to put everyone in a panic mode and I bet it won't raise back up for a long time. Chain reaction of selling. Wont be "dips" just BTC crashing and crashing

Exactly. If you buy anymore setup a wallet. Coinbase is pretty easy to get you started. A little higher on fees though.

I will be holding for a little longer, meh or maybe long term. but just curious on for when I do sell. Thanks

You won't get anything in return with such little investment. Go to an alt coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:06:26
All I can do is laugh and say why would you hold BTC on an exchange instead of a wallet. Live and learn

Thank you very much.
