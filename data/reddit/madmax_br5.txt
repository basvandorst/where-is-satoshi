2X bull ETF! Hold on for dear life!

You admit to not knowing about US politics and then spam this uninformed response all over as if it is fact.

The risk level is too high for mature investment firms to gamble on a big bet. Futures are leveraged, so your investment may actually represent 10X the value. Say I were to bet $1000 with 10X leverage that the price will fall (short position). Well if the price drops 10%, I double my money, since the I am exposed to 10X the price movement in bitcoin. But the opposite is also true -- if the price goes up 10%, I would lose all my money. If it goes up 20%, not only would I lose all my money, I would owe ANOTHER $1000 since my balance would be negative. So even though the rewards can be very great for shorting with leverage, the risks are even bigger, since you can lose more than your initial investment. Because of these high risk, it is unlikely that big wall street banks would be willing to invest significant amounts in short positions, at least not right away.

No that's only if you are in the RED. If you made 300k then lost 100k of it, your taxable income is 200k. If you made 300k then lost 350k, and were in the red 50k, you could only deduct 303K from your income and would have to carry over the remaining -47K for years to come, 3k per year.

That shouldn't matter in this case. If you received $300k and the price goes down to 200K and then you sell it, you would have a -$100k capital loss, so would only end up paying taxes on the 200K. Just make sure to sell by the end of the year to realize the loss (if that is in fact the case).

It's actually only 4% per week to get from $13k to $100k. Compound interest is a helluva thing.

The payback period is longer than it will take for your miners to be obsolete.

less than a year is considered short term, and you will need to pay normal income tax rate for any profits. Over a year is considered long  term and you pay a special lower rate, typically about 15%.

It only matters what you receive, not what you send. You would need to demonstrate that you owned the wallet or account it was sent FROM.

It's for any sale transaction. Doesn't matter if you leave it on the exchange or in bank account, still owe the taxes. So if you buy 1BTC for $10k, sell 1BTC for $15K, you need to pay taxes on your $5k profit. If you held the bitcoin for more than a year, you will pay a 15%  capital gains rate. If you held it for less than a year, you will pay your normal income tax of between 20-35% depending on your income bracket.

Well it's not free; the solar panels are a capital cost that amortizes over time. If you spent $10k on the solar panels and they produce 10kw for 5 hours a day on average (50kwh), then your power cost depends on how long you are in business for. If operating for three years, your effective power cost would be $10k divided by 54750 (50kwh/day X 1095 days), or 18 cents per kwh; equivalent to an electricity rate in an urban area. 
The issue is, next year new mining asics will come out that are double the efficiency. You become a much smaller part of the pool. So to maintain profitability you would have to buy new hardware every year to maintain the same profit factor. 
To run ten S9 miners 24x7, you need to produce 324kwh/day, which at $1/w peak output will cost you $65K in solar panels (which is generous). So your capital costs would be $65k in solar panels, $35K for ten S9 miners, $110K total. Calculators say that with ten S9s and ignoring power cost, that will currently return 86K/year. But with compute pool growing rapidly and miner hardware improving YoY, you will end up making a little bit of money over 2-3 years, but not all that much. Total 3-year ROI is maybe double your inital investment. At that rate, just buy coins (or any other investment).

You can just randomly generate until you find one you like -- similar to mining.
