1. Private blockchains are only useful in the context of multiple economic actors. That's beyond enterprise sales. It's *consortium* sales.
2. If enterprise sales is getting a bill through Congress, consortium sales is passing an international treaty. [link](
3. Private blockchains are more desirable when there is less trust (eg auditability is a goal). But less trust makes consortium sale harder.
4. One inkling of this can be seen [here](
5. An additional factor: there are fewer consortia than enterprises. Hence the market is more [oligopsonistic](
6. So: oligopsonistic market (few large buyers w/ long sales cycles) means lots of leverage vs private blockchain vendors. CAC will be high.
7. Moreover, LTV may not be that high, as consortia may demand totally open source solutions (e.g [PostChain-like](
8. That is, if history of internet micropayments is any guide, everyone wants to be the troll on the payment bridge - browsers, OS, banks.
9. So even if a consortium *does* agree on a private blockchain, pure open source options may dominate...as they are demilitarized zones.
10. That is, FB and Google compete on many things, but can cooperate on Linux as neither party can deprive the other of its contributions.
11. For similar reasons, it may be easier to get consortia to agree on a pure open source private blockchain than a for-profit option.
12. Even if they do agree on a commercial vendor, consortia members won't want to create a monster like studios did with Netflix/iTunes.
13. They have leverage - private blockchain only exists with consortia's cooperation! - so will be hard to sustain profits at their expense.
14. Thus, even though banks have a lot of money, for these logistical reasons it may be hard to build a large private blockchain company.
15. So, to sell private blockchain: (i) assemble a consortium (ii) deal with consortia leverage as buyer (iii) survive long sales cycles.
That's hard!
16.  Hard doesn't mean it's impossible. But consortium sales may prove to be the rate limiting step for private blockchain adoption.

If an attacker manages to compromise both our server and your computer then you are [SOL](  
If he manages to compromise just one, you're fine.  E.g. an attacker who managed to disrupt our email/sms would still be unable to initiate any transactions (he would need to somehow send them to you to be cosigned).
To answer your last question: our service does not allow you to update the email/phone number associated with an account because it's more bulletproof to let you simply transfer your funds to an account with a new policy.

I'm Lucas, the author of the post in question.
I personally *do* believe the most likely outcome will be that Bitcoin wins; i.e. remains the dominant cryptocurrency.  This belief is shared by *all* of the funds investors.  
Holding such a belief does not equate to thinking the expected value of investing in altcoins is negative (albeit the vast majority of the ones that currently exist are IMHO trash).  
The game is early and it's not clear the opportunities blockchain-based technology opens up will be as zero sum as some imagine.

If an attacker manages to compromise both our cosigning server as well as whatever wallet software you are using to manage your private keys (be it software from us or someone else) then you are SOL.  
This scenario is exactly the reason why I [earlier]( commented that a cosigning service should ideally be different from the wallet software provider and this is why we are pushing for other wallets to integrate our API.  
We see TrustedCoin as a cosigning service first and foremost, not a wallet provider.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:00:13
It looks like you accidentally double-pasted the public key trustedcoin [returned]( because the string you cite is two valid compressed SEC public keys back-to-back.
@_date: 2014-12-31 10:41:19
Viewed independently the fund would obviously perform better if an altcoin were to replace bitcoin as the dominant cryptocurrency.  However it's also fair to say this outcome would in a larger sense be net negative for all fund investors (including me) given that the lions share of our personal (non-fund) cryptocurrency portfolios remains bitcoin.

This is a joke.  The author [states](




Being able to collide 32 bits out of 256 realistically gets an attacker all of jack shit.
And how many "weak private keys" are their by his nonsensically arbitrary definition of the term?  "several million" * 768 ~= 2^32 
His claim amounts to saying that if your private key happens to be in this fixed arbitrarily defined "weak set" he can find it really fast ... the rub being that the chance of a key being in this set is about 1/2^224 .
Go home folks.  Nothing to see here.

Gavin's [BIP 11]( and his [thoughts when his faucet got hacked](  The [TrustedCoin blog](  [Bitgo]( and [CryptoCorp]( are also drinking the multisig cool-aid and their writeups make for good reading as well.  
Unfortunately the tools for accessing multisig functionality are by and large pretty primitive (bitcoin-qt command line voodoo or  ).  If you aren't faint of heart and have a strong grasp of bitcoin fundamentals [our docs]( walk through concrete low-level multisig examples step-by-step.
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:23:26
Best practice in a 2-of-3 scheme it to generate your two keys on different devices and store your "oh shit" secondary key in an inconvenient place.  Technically you can also sign using separate devices as well when performing recovery (transferring the partially signed tx from one device to the other) which would thwart local malware.  Our simple reference wallet doesn't support this but it's possible using bitcoinqt command line voodoo.
@_date: 2014-03-04 12:39:16
In this scenario you could simply use your primary+secondary key to unilaterally move your funds to a safe account (assuming you setup a 2-of-3 account).  
Our threat model assumes an attacker may (in addition to stealing your primary key) gain temporary read/write access to your email or phone ... but not irrevocable persistent access.  If you have a 2-of-2 setup and can't regain control of your email/phone, yes, you could be stuck in an endless race.  However, if Eve steals your primary key but you manage to lock her out of your email/phone - then at that point she can't cancel further withdrawal attempts.

it's possible to present a special type of proof (known as a zk-SNARK) that the the bounty address 13D1VNPVyepQWMBPR8XtfQfQ4FJ4qu7DD3 is indeed associated with a 18 character brainwallet formed from 3 words from a specific (possibly large) dictionary and ending with a single digit.  
this proof can be verified by anyone yet (amazingly) leaks zero information about what the brainwallet is other than that it has these properties the organizer claims it has.
this tech is new so there isn't a lot in the way of tools for constructing/verifying these proofs yet, but there should be relatively soon.

That's why in our model SMSs and emails don't serve to unconditionally authorize transactions ... only to veto them.

Despite being out for more than a year some wallets still don't support P2SH addresses ... conspicuous examples being blockchain.info ([soon though]( and all Java-based wallets (e.g. Multibit and Android wallets) that haven't yet upgraded to BitcoinJ [0.11+](  
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:44:56
even beyond the signing requirement, what contests like this really need is some sort of [zero-knowledge proof]( that the brainwallet associated with the bounty actually has the properties the organizer claims.

In a 2-of-3 multisig scheme where we are one cosigner you don't need to trust us.  Especially if you access us directly via our API and are using trusted software to generate the two other keys.  If you do use our software to generated these keys then you are trusting us.  However, an element of trust is irreducible in any situation where you run software you didn't write yourself.  Ideally we'd  like to see other wallet software providers build on us to minimize this problem.  IMHO a cosigning service should not be a wallet software provider.  The primary motivation behind building an open source wallet was to provide an example of how to integrate with our API.
There is no way we (or a hacker who has compromised our systems) can spend your coins with only 1 key in a 2-of-3 scheme.  At any point you can totally bypass us (and our fee) by signing your outputs with your 2 keys ... so even if we go tits up, you are fine.
If you opt for a 2-of-2 scheme with any cosigner, they can't spend your coins, but that cosigner could extort you (by refusing to cosign) or you could be S.O.L. if they disappear.  However, it's [our policy]( to simply publish our keys in the unlikely event we were to go under in order to prevent anyone relying on us as a cosigner from having unspendable coins.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:28:08
"Currently private for convenience" isn't exactly how I'd characterize this :)  Having a clear dissolution policy in the first place is hugely important (and too often overlooked) and this seemed the most defensible default.  In the event it happens it wouldn't be overnight.
But essentially: yes, you should still bother to lock your doors at night even though we're installing a barbed-wire fence around your house.
All this being said, the spirit of TrustedCoin is that we would eventually (for the right price) be able to enforce any cosigning policy the market demands (including ones that explicitly stipulate particular cosigning keys are to be destroyed instead of published in the event of dissolution).
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:31:09
I'm one of the co-founders of this project.  IMHO if you aren't aware of what multisig has to offer security-wise and you have a serious amount of coin do yourself a favor and research multisig now (even if you decide not to use us at all).
Even cold storage based solutions can benefit from leveraging multisig because you can construct schemes where you never are reassembling all the secrets necessary to spend your coins on one (possibly compromised) device ... something you can't say about simple shamir secret splitting of private keys.   
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:43:07
Ideally native wallet software like QT, Electrum and Multibit will eventually offer a "cosigned-wallet" option, where when you create a wallet you can choose a cosigner (which need not be a 3rd party service ... it could just be as simple as another device you control running cosigning software) as well as the parameters of the policy you want the cosigner to enforce.  
That said it will take a while for standards to emerge for and real interoperability to evolve.  Trustedcoin is just our first stab at moving the ball down the field on what will be a long game.

I filed a bug report with them earlier ... it seems like their wallet software sometimes creates transactions with immature coinbase (as in coin generation ... not coinbase.com) inputs (it's a protocol rule that newly mined coins can't be spent for 100 blocks).  This causes later transactions to backlog because subsequent spends relying on the change outputs from these sorts of transactions get orphaned.  Not sure if you're running into the same issue.   Grrrr ....

there's a tiny possibility the passphrase is still in physical system memory if you haven't turned off your computer ... since i'd guess clipboard memory isn't zeroed before it's freed.  
using dd and /dev/mem you can dump it to disk, do a "strings" on it and then write a program to search the output for sequences of words that match the carbonwallet mnemonic word-list  
... probably won't work ... but if you lost a lot, worth a shot.

I could see secret sharing acting as a single puzzle piece in a more complete solution, but my question was meant to encompass both the procedural as well as technical aspects of dealing with this sort of scenario.  
Imagine you come into work tomorrow and your boss announces that your office is now the custodian of a $28.5M account and you are responsible for drafting a security policy to make sure it stays safe.  How would you deal with this?  What "office rules" would you make?  What threat-models would you entertain in trying to find a workable policy.

The answer to your question is yes.  There are two variations of multisig: direct and P2SH (pay-to-script-hash).  In the direct case it's obvious because the key requirements are encoded in the outputs of any transaction sending to the multisig account.  In the (more common) P2SH case your multisig address is created by hashing the script representing the key requirements.  Just looking at a P2SH address you can't tell anything about it.  However, in order to spend from it you need to know the script it's a hash of.  Therefore, any provider who generates a P2SH address for you needs to give you the underlying script as well and you can verify the script is kosher and hashes to the address expected.

By coinbase-type system I assume you mean a web wallet that manages private keys on your behalf.  In this case the solution is to lobby the wallet site to add an irrevocable daily withdrawal limit feature and actually enforce it.  You're already totally trusting coinbase in this security model anyway so this is simplest solution that applies specifically to what you asked.
If you are using a wallet where you manage private keys yourself (e.g. bitcoin-qt), then the multisignature approach others have alluded to is the way to go.  Using a 2-of-3 scheme you can avoid the possibility of being extorted by the 3rd party enforcing the spending policy.  If you store your extra "oh shit" key [time-lock encrypted]( in some safe somewhere, then even under duress you would still be unable to unilaterally sweep your account to some other address in any reasonable amount of time.

I've developed a multisig co-signer API  that can be used for wallet security.  Kinda need to be a developer to use it at the moment but I'm working on a wallet that integrates with it.
There's also [mbelshe's](  2-of-3 web wallet implementation [here](
