The stock market is doing pretty well right now as well, I would recommend you diversify, but I didn't get a bitcoin lambo, I got a bitcoin Kia, lol.

We just mined them from our laptops, every few days you would hear a little ping and message would come up on your computer screen that you mined a bitcoin. Now it takes like a month to mine a bitcoin and that's with an ASIC.

I just left coinbase for hitbtc.com, they have more coins available to buy/sell.

If they really were involved in insider trading and shorting BCH, BTC, then yes. It is still being investigated so I wouldn't grab the pitchfork just yet.

He changed it $10 Million, saying his prediction of $1 Million in 2020 was based on the assumption the BTC would be worth $5,000 at the end of 2017, since BTC is closing $20,000 by the end of 2017 he upped his 2020 prediction.

If you can verify them on the blochchain, they are. At that price,probably not worth the plastic they are printed on.

Isn't that advertising BCH?

In the very near future probably, I'm buying as much as I can right now.

Vladimir Putin would have to be a complete dumb ass to give a known whistle blower any level of security clearance in Russia.

Is this a US thing? I haven't been charged any fees by Master card or my bank. I use a debit card and savings union, not some big bank like Bank of America.

Thank you, that actually makes a lot of sense.

Interesting to see how that could legally play out, the US constitution forbids anyone other than the federal government to print currency inside the US.

He was trolling all those bots that would buy/sell based solely on whatever his twitter was preaching on about.

I thought it was, and Keanu Reeves narrated it.

I'm one of the lucky ones that keeps buying at the lowest of the dips and then watch the profits come in. This is like my fourth time buying low.
