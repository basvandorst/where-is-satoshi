Well I liked hearing about it, fuck the salty people. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:04:09
Not really. I use Excel as a basic calculator all the time.

This is probably a dumb question but does segwit implementation require a hard fork?
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:40:05
Comments like these make crypto enthusiasts seem dumb as fuck. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:09:37


At the cost of decentralization though, correct? 
Not trying to be snarky btw, just trying to learn. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:55:48
20% is absolutely misguided and scary. I feel bad for OP. Sure there’s a small chance things will be alright but.... who knows. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:52:57
No less crystal bally then other posts on here saying its going to 19k in a month lmfao.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:48:24
This is my plan. I'm not so comfortable with risk that I would "invest" any sizeable chunk of money into BTC. That said, what I DO have in BTC, I'm cashing out as soon as I make some money on it. I think Blockchain tech will be revolutionary, but I think that BTC is like AOL or Netscape. Yeah there's some mileage there, but Google will ultimately destroy them all. I don't have the skill or knowledge to predict that Google in terms of crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:57:12
Pretty cringe IMO.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:03:15
This is so important. At the end of the day, bitcoin is a gamble. Retiring shouldn’t be a gamble. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:52:47
lol don’t put this on him dude. He’s just pointing out the unnecessarily hyperbolic nature of your post. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:05:24
Some of the shit you read on here...
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:36:59
lmao there is no way I'm supporting Fidelity "instead". Vanguard is the shit and if they continue down the path they have always gone down, I will support them over everything else in terms of investment vehicles. Yes, even Bitcoin. These kind of posts just appear childish if I'm being honest.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:55:29
After reading a lot of your replies, the sad conclusion I've come to is that you're not even close to smart enough to be "investing" in Bitcoin. Not that you need to be especially intelligent to do so but you can't be borderline mentally handicapped IMO. Its going to be sad when you end up homeless trying to suck dick for the "worthless fiat scum". 
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:30:23
No no you misunderstand. I was just using Google and AOL as an analogy of sorts. I just think some other crypto besides BTC will “win” in the end. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:42:33
Why would you invest what you can't afford to lose? did you think it was just a guaranteed method of getting rich quick? did you wonder why if it was guaranteed everyone in the world (including people smarter than you) wasn't getting into it?
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:39:37
People who listen to stuff like this and end up homeless- I feel 0 sympathy for you. I feel even less for you OP as your irresponsibility with your "advice" makes you deserve whatever happens to you.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:29:46
No guarantee it will come back up, my random guess is that it won’t. If it does start to come back up I’ll buy back in. Maybe. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:27:57
How is it hostile? you're reading it that way. I'm a BTC skeptic and even I think if you really think what you think- short it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:33:45
This comment is how you separate the idiots from the smart ones.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:25:59
RIP bitcoin/possibly crypto in general.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:37:10


...Or y'know, let people do whatever they want with their money.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:56:08
Couple more cringe posts like this and I’m going to have to unsubscribe. Feel stupid just by association really. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:30:29
People on here are delusional. r/BTC is not a good place for anything but some light entertainment. This is clear when you look at everything bad being labeled “fud”.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:08:01
lmfao y’all silly people deserve to be broke. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:20:49

I’m sorry but you literally don’t know anything about investing if you think it’s almost always a gamble. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:26:19
Smart move. I got out at $8700 myself. Not a single minute of regret. Putting the money in my Roth IRA since the market is down. Good time to do some real investing. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:25:36
lmao $8.9k
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:42:27
True story. Just moved to legit investments and couldn't be happier. Now its just entertaining watching the nose dive. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:32:31
If bitcoin is going to be what it promises to be, it can’t rely on the whims and kindness of people to succeed. It has to succeed in spite of human nature. If it can’t weather this storm then it wasn’t going to be all that it was promised to be anyway. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:15:44
Yep. On the one hand its annoying to see, on the other hand it serves as a quick and reliable indicator of maturity level. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:34:43
Good for you man! : )
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:45:59
Reminds me of that scene from the Titanic when the captain decides to go down with the ship lmao.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:29:41
lmao. This is why I can’t bring myself to feel sorry for people losing money. Like...not even a little bit. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:39:52
Do dragons and sorcerers also exist in your fantasy world?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:50:32
Is there a scenario where BTC fails and you don't blame the current powers that be? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:28:10
Both. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:22:33
That's not why I bought it, just want to make some money. If it happens to help other things along the way- great. If not, meh. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:52:50
No more or less of a point to it then 99% (literally) of the shit that gets posted on here. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:50:01
when they run out of things to attack and minor spelling errors are all they got
