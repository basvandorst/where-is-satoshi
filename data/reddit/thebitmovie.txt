Thank you! We will be leaving Washington, DC and heading to Richmond, VA so unfortunately we wont make it to Norfolk.. But we will 100% be passing through Durham, NC and will certainly take you advise! Sincere thanks

Yes and no, let us explain.
Im not sure that we consider it "cheating", certainly we agree it would be ideal to be able to do everything exclusively with Bitcoin 1:1 with retailers who accept Bitcoin, but I dont think doing so is exactly what we are trying to accomplish. Our goal is simply to only spend bitcoin and although we agree that buying gift cards with bitcoin may be a work around, we dont feel it detracts from what we are trying to accomplish overall.
So far we have been successful in not having to use gift cards purchased with Bitcoin. We have used Bitcoin backed debit cards for fuel, we have made our hotel reservations using expedia.com paying with the new Bitcoin payment option and we have eaten exclusively at restaurants that accept bitcon. (minus breakfast that is included with our hotel room)  
We do intend to use gift cards at some point though, if for no other reason that for the experience. There are many ways to use bitcoin, not all of which are direct 1:1 and we are ok with that. We do hope to do this trip again in a year from now and be able to do everything 1:1 but at this point in time we feel part of the fun is finding new creative ways to get things done while we wait for a little more adoption by retailers that will allow wide spread day-to-day use 1;1

Looking now on Yelp, cant seem to find the option for "accepts Bitcoin" ? I have read the articles found online from April saying it was a new function, but can seem to find it?

Have not noticed anything out of the ordinary yet, but we've not been in many remote locations. I'll be curious to see how things run out in the Nevada desert. 8)

We have been using coinmap.org and also google, coinmap.org is great, but we have also been successful in finding local business that are not on coinmap.org 
Searching google has helped us find articles in local papers and on local blogs that makes mention of local area business now accepting bitcoin. 8)

Great question. The simple answer is, no, because we have not thought to use Yelp.. But it sounds like a great resource, we had just not thought of that. Thank you!
