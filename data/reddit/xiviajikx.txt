Being a peer is about relaying/validating block data and transactions into the mempool. Sending a transaction has nothing to do with being a peer.

Insurance. Coinbase has the best insurance. FDIC for FIAT and 100% for crypto as well. Can't really beat that today

Being a peer is about being a peer on the network; meaning you both send and receive data across the network. If you're not a full node, you can't necessarily send data you don't have so you're not a peer.

FDIC does not insure all banks and exchanges, only those who are compliant with all of their regulations as officially registered financial institutions. And coinbase does have insurance on all their crypto. Should anything happen to it, users will be returned money in exchange for their currency as the currency isn't physically recoverable because it's cryptocurrency.

What you described is what I believe to be known as a "fork"

Yes he did. If he knew there would be mining farms in the future, what difference does it make if everyone combines their hashing power instead of one entity basically having a farm. Maybe he didn't explicitly say it, but he was smart enough to know it was something that could exist.

I quite often remember everyone saying Bitcoin can do 3 tx/second while Visa can do thousands, we need to beat Visa. Somewhere along the way this line of thinking fell out of favor and now we're crippling in speed and volume.

Not sure what you're getting at, but 90% of the hashpower supports 2x. If even only 20% move to 2x, block times will slow down, and on top of that the blocks are smaller than 2x. I can't see it going any other way, cause hashpower is king.

Miners get to run the code; they secure the network. The whole point of being decentralized is that there is no central authority to control the protocol and control the software. Miners can run whatever code they want, and if they follow the protocol then their mining is valid. The miners will always have the final say as it's them to secure the network. That being said, it's unfortunate that mining has basically become centralized due to ASICs and the few large players collating most mining hardware.

He might technically be right, but the price was either going to go up or down as it still showed to be unstable, so by predicting one of those two possible directions there are still only two outcomes where he is either going to be right or wrong, and still in a very nominal and random way (who can *really* predict the price?). He isn't any smarter than anyone else, and calling these people out for simply predicting the opposite outcome, or believing that he would be wrong doesn't really prove any more of point that OP is right.
I also want to point out I have nothing against this guy personally (I have no idea who he is), but I just think he's wrong.

You can call me a shill, but I read and post on both subs. I hold neither coin (just dust), but I've been following bitcoin since 2011. I don't have any vested interest in either chain, but I also don't think Segwit and LN will be the solution to the scaling problems. If the miners want 2x, then they can make 2x happen. Hashing power is the ultimate decider.

Bitcoin is supposed to be *better* than banks.

Samsung has all the resources to build their own ASICs; at this point with all the money in it there's no reason not to.

They only make over 50k a day if we're assuming that being "totally booked" means that every single room is booked, and we assume that their room count is the 180 mentioned. Chances are they aren't always fully booked, but in this case they mentioned how it's the beginning of their winter season.

They're waiting for 2X so they can send their coins for much lower fees.

That lady is pretty stupid. If the government is shutting down the internet or shutting down the power grids to stop bitcoin, then what good is cash going to do? Clearly at that point you have a tyrannical government and your raw currency is going to become guns and bullets.
