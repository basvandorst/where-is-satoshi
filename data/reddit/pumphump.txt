sorry man but you don’t really have recourse here.  a quick google search of bitaddress shows that it shouldn’t be trusted.

this is the internet brudda.  i backed up my words with proof, to assume i’m not getting what i need in life is ridiculous.  talking with you plebs is fun.  i’m not even trolling.  i do genuinely believe the other guy is an idiot - and you now too.  so many assumptions from this crowd, no wonder all other crypto subs scream that this is a delusional censored echo chamber ayyyyyyy lmao ��

Yeah.. i make money at every opportunity, you wait and complain when others make money.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:18:22
dog it’s not trolling if i’m being genuine with my statement about you.  this is how you come off.  go cry to wall street bets that you make no money.

not at all, you just don’t give up.  jealousy is a sin, dog.  people made money, people lost money.  improve your FA skills and be a better trader.

yes every time you respond it puts a smile on my face ��

nice assumption but nah i’m long eth.  in fact, most of my stack is eligible for long term cap gains.  look at me, trading AND investing!  amazing how i choose what to trade and what to hold!  
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:13:55
