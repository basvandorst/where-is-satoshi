I don't disagree - however there really isn't any definitive proof to say BTC would go up if the global economy takes a downturn. It could equally as likely go down if you're honest with yourself.

Sure I didn't get back in at $3,000 but then again, nobody did because BTC only ever wicked $3,120 ;)
I waited for confirmation before I bought because I don't just gamble.

I did exactly that 4 Months ago -   [ 
I will post again in time when I am as confident about the futures as I was about this call.

This "hindsight advantage" wasn't that visible 4 months ago - [
Also, this isn't a trading strategy. Trading purely off weekly MACD crosses isn't that great of an idea - this is more of a long term perspective on HOW you should be trading since 4 months ago we CLEARLY started entering a bear market. How I determine the entry price on my long/short positions has almost nothing to do with the weekly MACD apart from how I see the trend going out for the next weeks/months to come.

I don't post a lot - let alone TA predictions because the comments are LITTERED with people like yourself who know nothing about it and LEGITIMATELY think it's just squiggly lines with no meaning or predictive value.

Funny enough I have charts from January 2019 predicting the bull run within 3 weeks of when it actually happened [LOOK AT THE 89 TIME FIB]( (It lands on March 6th, the pump happened on April 1st - interesting right ? Especially looking back at the 2012/2014 pumps and how the 89 Time Fib lines up.) And here is a [ROUGH CONSERVATIVE ACCUMULATION ZONE]( of the $3000 low point - but I never all-in, I ladder my buys and I dollar cost average my entries so I bough on the way down, and on the way up. So yes I took advantage of that. You can bet I took advantage of the foresight I had regarding BTC's recent correction. And you can bet I have a pretty good hunch on where BTC is going in the future - but hey, game is sold, not told so why should I just disclose to you my position to you for free ? XD

Sure AI is very good at dealing with large data sets - and that's what TA is,  just a copious amount of data. However, there are things currently in the market that AI cannot account for - this has largely to do with the underlying fundamentals of an asset as these properties cannot be properly quantified in any meaningful way. 
When an AI/Bot runs a model in which it trades of weekly MACD crosses, it proves to be a very ineffective strategy when it's backtested. However, that's not what I've done. I simply used the weekly MACD as a signal for HOW I should be trading and WHAT I should be looking for - aka a long term bearish trend. This helped me immensely in properly shorting the subsequent pumps on the way down since I was very certain of the fact that the bearish trend would continue for weeks on out. However, how I determined each short entry had next to nothing to do with the weekly MACD.

I mean you're free to pull up the weekly MACD on a larger time-frame if you want to see everything.
It's context, yes the "lines" which are moving averages crossed, but that doesn't just mean I all in - you have to take it in the context of what else is happening in the market.
I don't ever risk everything on a single trade - I dollar cost average, ladder my buys and sells.
