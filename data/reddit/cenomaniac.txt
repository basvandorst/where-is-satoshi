It depends on how long you anticipate your holding period to be.

Coinbase is crap for actually making efficient money on a day to day basis. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:48:49
Totally agree. I've pulled out until I can determine WTF has been happening these past 24-36hrs. It looks like a big selloff could occur. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:34:21
Woah, volume.... someone just pumped it up to $8800... now comes the dump? Also look at that sell wall at 9k, sheesh. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:02:56


@_date: 2018-02-18 06:59:18
Fuuuck this I’m out. Selling while I’m still ahead.
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:54:40
They are when you're looking to buy. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:11:35
Yeah, the quickness of the growth in the past 36hrs should have been a sign not to buy over 10.4k. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:35:25
Oh for sure. Could very well be lower. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:56:40
Holy shit, an inkling of resistance around 9800. Interesting. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:22:12
Down is correct imho
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:42:49
It’s *never* a bad idea to sell when your net assets are positive. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:10:24
If you follow the trend of the lows, the next low spot might be around $8900. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:48:28
It will be lucky to hit 9. It’ll be bouncing below 8 again shortly.
Edit: See?
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:54:07
Found the HODLer. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:01:07
It's not happening so far though. If we see $7900 in the next 24 hours, it will not bode well for this prediction. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:15:42
Don’t buy above $8k.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:09:48
I am only willing to gamble about 3 grand. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:47:54
lol ok
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:58:50
The longer this goes without consistently breaking 9-9.5k the more it looks like this is fitting the monthly bearish trend. 
Still hard to say if we'll see slow price rises or a precipitous drop. We'll know by the weekend.  
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:20:20
What matters is your net holdings. You’re either underwater or you’re not; you can’t be both.
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:05:42
Too soon to say. If it kisses 9k again today, then probably not. If it falls below 8k and stays there, then maybe.
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:59:40
There was a huge jump last night from like 8600 to 8900 in about 30 mins. Volume went from small to large. Total speculation but it seemed like a pump, although not sure where the dump is...
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:54:07
Wooooooooo! All in! Buy buy buy buy! $$$
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:00:10
lol. On what basis? What you want to be true? Looking at the price trends I wouldn't be surprised if we have another push or two towards 11k, but then the lows will start dropping consistently back below 10k. I could even see a major drop to 5.5k soon, just based on the ~monthly patterns. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:18:45
I’m leaning toward this just continuing the bearish trend of the past two months. It wouldn’t surprise me if it were fluctuating around 7k soon. 
I hope I’m wrong and it goes up, but that just isn’t happening so far. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:23:07
Bitcoin is for my entertainment, not my retirement, or even my investment.
If you differ, more power to you. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:39:26
If the US mass defaults on its debt, and the dollar crashes, I am not sure our primary concern would be our savings. I suspect there might be more acute worries. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:13:31
The hive mind disagrees. Which usually means I am right when it comes to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:57:50
Hah, looking at the yearly trend it looks like bitcoin is still falling. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:51:58


You misspelled the word "gamble."
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:52:41
You can’t yet say it’s going up again. The 6k dip fit the bearish pattern of the past two months, and it would have to recover to 10k or so soon to conclude its bullish again.
If it keeps bouncing around 8k it’s looking like at best a return to mean or remaining bearish.
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:21:41
Buy under $8k and you’ll be ok for a couple days. Buy over $8k and gamble.
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:21:24
Eh, following the monthly trend of lows since 6k shows it could be bottoming out around 9700. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:06:52
I only ever regret losing money, not making it. If I make money, I win. And I made money. Also the magnitude of this dip is unprecedented since 6k. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:07:37
$8700 is it for the night, AFAIK. I'm out. Placing my overnight limit down low.
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:25:11
Woooo I like money!
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:52:11
Riding small percentage changes with small portions of my heap right now. Waiting for it to go back down. I think we'll see a natural dip 8.9-9.1k later today. Then buy buy buy.
