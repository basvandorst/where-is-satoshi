Do we know all of the keys?

Then he could have ones outside the trust?
He seems to have managed to get several million somehow? The debt was paid and the loans are no longer owing.

Given the state of news reporting we can all blog our ways to a job :)

And there still seems to be nothing being asked for.
Lots of attacks from the Blockstream people and hyperbole but not a good deal of fact.
So what if Wright was to give away money rather than try and take it? Would this also be some plot?

Text analysis... Next it will be rubbing crystals!

Seems there was a payout...
The ATO "story" is not as it seems.
They raided him the day before a settlement?

Did he pay in Bitcoin ;)

Seems the "story" is not as it was lead to be.
Wright has paid out the company and the raid seems to have been a "negotiating" ploy from the government.

Seems they settled with him.

The School of Arabic Studies in Cordoba, "The existence of representations of tulips in the temples of Konya (Turkey) which date from the 11th century, and the mention of al-Andalus in the Umda, point towards the introduction of tulips into Europe some 500 years before the references known up until today."
Seems that there was some rather obscure research....

What we seem to have most of is a series of attacks with little if any truth on any side.
Has anyone even validated the "evidence" or are we all to trust those with a vested interest in not having Satoshi back.
I have not seen the slightest evidence that Wright is actually seeking funding. Not prior nor now. Accusations are flying around and it seems mud sticks as the answers are not being supplied and fall into a black hole on the other side.
As a flip side, I wonder what people would think if it turned out that Wright was not seeking funds at all. What if this is not some grand plan. Then what?

It seems there was research published in a journal called "Economic Botany"
Turns out tulip bulbs are actually edible and were known as Macedonian onions... The research shows the tulip came into Europe 500 years before the Holland bubble and that Wright must have been reading some really obscure stuff. Who would think there is a journal on economic botany?
Extremely obscure and only recently discovered...
