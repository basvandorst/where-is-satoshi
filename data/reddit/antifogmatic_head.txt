The value of your alts depends on the crypto you used to purchase the alt, such as BTC or ETH. 
You bought your alts in an [ALT]-BTC market. If you had done so in a [ALT]-ETH (Ethereum) exchange, you would've been unaffected by this dip (and in fact, better off in this instance). 
However, once BTC rises again, your alts' BTC &amp; USD values will go back up as well.

Yeah, I'm very confused why my alts are going down at the same time as btc. I thought they always went up while the other went down.

And they're panic selling BTC into USD? That would make sense. I guess staying in cryptos is just an alternative form of hodling. Those wanting to truly panic sell would get out of alts altogether.

An example would be simplest:
1. You have $1000 USD.
2. You buy $1000 BTC.
3. You buy $1000 ALT-BTC.
4. BTC drops 25%.
5. ALT-BTC also drops 25%, to $750.
6. BTC rises 33%.
7. ALT-BTC also rises 33%, to $1000.
Repeat exercise with ETH by replacing "ETH" with "BTC".
Edit: This is extremely simplified, completely ignoring any fluctuation in ALT-BTC. To complicate matters, any fluctuation in the price of ALT-BTC would be affected by the fluctuation in BTC. If the value of ALT-BTC goes down 50% ($500) at the same time that BTC goes down 25%, now you have only $375 of your original $1000. The inverse is also true: if your ALT-BTC doubles in value 200% ($2000) at the same time that BTC rises 25%, you now have $2500, a $1500 profit over your original $1000.

Andreas is such a great voice for cryptocurrency. I like that he talks beyond the price and focuses on how this is good for the community as a whole. It shows that crypto has the ability to self-correct, which will shovel out the shitcoins, just like all the on-paper internet companies that were raking in millions and not doing actually doing any work in the 1990s. It makes way for the Apples, Microsofts, Googles, Amazons, Facebooks, and Reddits of the world. Granted there are major issues with all of these companies/communities, but by and large, life is better off with them in the same way that life is going to be better off with the surviving cryptos compared to the hundreds of shitcoins out there which won't be around in 5 years. Overall, corrections like this make crypto stronger because it grounds the price to human-determined value.

Can you elaborate on that? Btw, by USD I meant fiat, not tether (USD-T). Why would holding tether when the "party" ends be a problem? If you sell $10,000 worth of bitcoin into tether, and the price of BTC falls by 25%, you still have $10,000 worth of tether, not $7500, which it would've been had you stayed in btc.

Wonderfully written. Thank you.
