I've invested in genesis mining for a year. They are legit but I doubt people joining now are able to mine their investment back. Better to just buy. If you are still intent to do it then hit me up and you can use an affiliate code for a discount

As soon as you give me a donation of at least 2000$ I will call the ceo of bitcoin Inc and tell them to change it to over 9000 for you again

Just happened to me, didn't even get an email. HOWEVER took 2 minutes to fill out the verification and was accepted 15 minutes later

How about for Windows?

I mean you COULD consider it more stable but you would also be wrong

I thought lbc pertected against scams, how did it happen? 
@_date: 2019-06-06 21:35:15
Even worse, they are stealing from those who deposited into the lending accounts this week, after the crash happened

How much effort do you have to put in to earn enough for a payout? 
@_date: 2019-02-18 21:12:15
Thanks =D
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:45:08
Me too! Could be because I live in Europe tho... 
@_date: 2019-02-18 21:07:27
The answer is in the currency. it is sweden from one of the largest electronic stores, 3500 swedish dollars is about 250 USD

Did you even read what he said before you copy and pasted that statement, what he is asking is a valid question.

With bitcoin we are our own banks... I hate you too new friend!

I agree they are not the best company, but it still allowed me to use BTC to pay for a phone which I would not be able to do otherwise.  so its still a +1 on BTC adoption from this guy today
@_date: 2019-12-07 00:20:03
I've adopted a similar stetegy except I kept notification for any 10+% change so that I can either buy the dips or get a little excitement that prices are going as planned for the next halvening which ever way it goes I am happy and don't need to look daily

Great looking into it now, it does seem better for what I'm looking for
@_date: 2019-04-09 11:15:29
Depends where you have your coins, everywhere will charge you to move them out, but if you have a chance where they are to trade them for a stablecoin linked to the USD price, it would be the equivalent of cashing out, then just trade it back to BTC later
@_date: 2019-04-09 11:24:31
Thats just it you cant and is a leading reason I do not believe in bigger blocks to reduce fees, we can optimize how things are right now sooo much better than they currently are.  Unfortunately for now we are SOL and have to wait and put pressure on these guys to become more efficient

Where A1 is the cell with your btc amount. also works if you replace usd with any currancy you want
@_date: 2019-04-09 12:08:04
Seconded, with low amounts this is your only option that won't take it all in fees
@_date: 2019-04-09 11:19:41
Agreed, completely wrong direction here.  Would pay regular and then buy more BTC for the same amount elsewhere so that it feels like I paid in BTC but the overhead profits go to somewhere else that appreciates it more

Coinbase is a great place to start. It is simple to set up and buy. Do remember not to keep your coins there long, get them into your wallet asap. This is true for any exchange. Once you are a bit more advanced I do like bisq and use it currently but it is very much not beginner friendly.
@_date: 2019-04-17 09:54:48
probably because i forgot to close the "", typo fixed.  They removed this function a few months ago but it is back and it works fine now
@_date: 2019-04-05 21:51:32
Download bisq. You can set up an e transfer to your Canadian bank account and don't need to trust anyone with your funds
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:14:29
The only real solution is buy a bit now and buy a bit more if it goes down another 500. If anyone knew when it would be back to 6000 they would be billionaires for predicting the future

Well ya it's winter, pants season. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:18:43
Exactly what I was looking for! Thanks

I have a withdraw in a state of awaiting approval for 2 months now.  When I opened a ticket they said they are very busy, please be patient and dont open another ticket.  Customer service 0/10, moral of story, dont hold your breath

Can always use Local bitcoins, it can take 5 minutes from start of trade to spending your coins
