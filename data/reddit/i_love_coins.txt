Yeah, it doesn't matter what kind of power ...
But there's something, something, in the future. Solar Power already has some peaks of more than 100 percent of the demand for power. If you want to achieve a 100 percent renewable energy market, you'd have to produce in peaks (much storm, much sunshine) 1500 percent or more of the demanded energy. On the market the cable-providers take money to take the energy when the demand is lower than the productions. The producers have to pay to give them power. Bitcoin Mining could be a great alternative to use this zero-value-power.

Yeah, sure ... but biomass is a tiny piece of renewables and in most cases economically senseless. 
The current plan for renewable energy is to build many many wind- and solar powerhouses. And if you compare their kw-peak with their specific power, you have to accept that we will see peaks with much much unused energy. 
This could be perfect for miners.

I thought about how I can change Euro to NOK (norway kronas) using bitcoin. But I didn't find any comfortable option and will use my old and expensive bank to get norway cash.
As long as bitcoin is not accepted in the majority of shops worldwide it's no good solution for internationalen transactions. By now bitcoin is an instrument to trade. But I love this.

Same with me. Both Bitstamp and kraken's IBAN was blocked. Since then I only use bitcoin.de. This exchange is safe from this kind of bank-attacks. Also I am very satisfied with their service and support. Many people more should use it.

Uh, Ah, did I really read this?
"Regrettably, the abominable BitLicense has awakened.  It is a creature so foul, so cruel that not even Kraken possesses the courage or strength to face its nasty, big, pointy teeth.  It’s at least a 40-man, bro."
Who did write the post? Some 14-year-old who thinks he is funny? That's absolutely ridicolous.
