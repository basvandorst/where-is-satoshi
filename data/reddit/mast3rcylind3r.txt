You think futures will drive the price down? Can you explain your thinking? In my world, I'm thnking futures will increase the demand further and given that the supply is fixed I'm predicting a big price jump.

No one knows where the price is going. Like I said, use your best judgement and don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Hence why I didn't bet my life's savings in 2013.

Luck? Did I "luckily" decide to spend $2,000 on Bitcoin in 2013? And "luckily" held onto it when it dropped by 70% in value? There's no luck involved -- it's just people doing what they think is best, you make your own luck.

I bought in in 2013, at the then ATH. Dropped $2400 on two coins. My girlfriend at the time said I was an idiot. I've been HODLing ever since.

I think there's already a coin for this. Lest you forget our dear friend Doge.

What makes you say that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:22:23
If the Wall Street guys where smart, they'd already be hodling. Point taken though. Guess we'll see what happens, I'm expecting 20k by Tuesday.

It's because many of us have considered and believed in the inherent value in Bitcoin years ago. We we're scoffed at by almost everyone, and now our investments have finally paid off BIG. That's not to say that Bitcoin is a "guarantee" by any stretch of the imagination (nothing in life is), but many of us -- myself included -- think that this is a world changing technology and are excited to see it mature. If it lives up to our expectations, we expect it to compete with traditional fiat and commodity markets which gives it a ton of room to grow further. That, or something happens that makes it worthless... A few things I can think of would be 1) heavily regulated and monitored internet 2) encryption breaking technology, perhaps quantum computing 3) any other events that could re-shape global economic markets. Just my opinion; I'll be holding on to my Bitcoin for years to come as I don't have any urgent need or reason to cash out now.

�� agree. Fuck those scumbags on wall Street. They're going to try and manipulate this thing but I think they're going to pay big for it. The spread is too high. If they put with a $5000 strike price, there's still plenty of people who will snap that up as an chance to buy more during a dip. No one knows what's going to happen at this point, the institutional investers really don't have an advantage -- perhaps less so since they've been trained to think about trading in a specific setting. Can't wait to break it to them but Bitcoin is neither a commodity or a stock so what they expect to happen likely won't.

I have a paper wallet already. I'm just wondering why this does not exist.

Hi Bruce--assuming from your name that you are who you claim ;)
What are your thoughts on ideas/projects that require substantial start-up capital? How would one approach a VC firm with virtually nothing but an idea/plan for something much more large scale?

Does Andreas frequent this sub? Is there a way I could get his contact information? I would love to speak with ways I can get more involved with Bitcoin either on a full or part-time basis.

Hi Ben,
I hope you can find this under the pitchforks. Here is my only suggestion:
Limit any regulations to *exchanges only* and not businesses or individuals. Exchanges will be the gate keepers for how many (dare I say most future) users of cryptocurrencies actually buy and sell bitcoin, and they should have some sort of gov't stamp of approval / regulation. If you want to buy and sell outside exchanges based in NY, then you are free to do so. You will fail if you try to regulate Bitcoin in any way other than at the exchange level (example: music/video pirating).  
If you want to be successful in regulating Bitcoin and keep the users of Bitcoin happy, then the only way to do this is to provide regulation for exchanges. Anything beyond that is not feasible and defeats the point of Bitcoin. Regulating exchanges gives you a chance to set up a secure avenue for every day users that people will trust! This is a HUGE opportunity, please don't blow it by trying to over regulate!

This is true, but what is the difference between trusting a website like this and trusting an exchange like mtgox?
