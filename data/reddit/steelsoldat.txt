Going through a really interesting time in my life right now, and the thought of someone giving to people they don't know on their own birthday(which in America seems to be selfishly celebrated) is extremely beautiful to me.
Thanks for the post, it's really gotten me thinking &amp;&amp; feeling much better knowing that there are people that do this(never seen it done before, much less with BTC lol).

They usually use Ebay accounts, although would you be able to have an Ebay account? If not I could try to help you out with selling them.
