Much better experience with CoinBase Vs. Xapo. I frequently use the Shift debit card to spend my miners' earnings on little tidbits here and there and have never had a problem. I haven't had to look around for a better alternative, so if there are any I wouldn't know. Then again, maybe I'm not having any problems because my largest spending transactions haven't been over 1.25BTC anyway...

Well it depends which crypto algorithm you are mining as they will all hash differently. This might be a better post for r/NiceHash though

I bought mine on Amazon and it was fine. Sold and shipped via amazon and not a third party. When I received the Ledger it prompted me during the setup process to generate a new seed and had me write the seed down myself. This wasn't a a case of a hacked compromised device, but rather a clever criminal who pulled some slight of hand.

This turned out way funnier than I anticipated. (I never enjoyed this show I’m quite the anti BBT) It didn’t get into any of the Bitcoin politics, no shaming, no fear mongering, etc. it didn’t portray Bitcoin in a negative light. It didnt make anyone want to go buy it though either. It might have just sparked someone’s random curiosity. I don’t expect any price manipulation because of this. (CB only went up $75 after the show ended) While it wasn’t wonderful, it could have been so much worse.
It did however teach you to buy a Ledger Nano S or Trezor and keep your backup seed in a safe place. Hardware wallets may not have been a thing yet at that time. Either way, Mr. Comic Book Store is the MVP now!
I overall kinda enjoyed it. Entertained me enough to see it through. Let’s go buy some more.

Same here, I've been mining with them since they launched. I noticed as of late that getting to the .01BTC payout was taking longer and longer and was thinking of bringing it up to their attention that they should lower the requirement due to the price increasing so much. I literally just reached the payout threshold 2 nights ago. So you're not alone with losing out on around $120.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:58:14
Your AV is wrong. They flag miners because some shady software companies bundle miners in with freeware to use your pc to mine for them. NiceHashMiner is the way to go. Good earnings. Unfortunately a payout these days is around $100, so it’s going to take a while for you to get there. They pay you once you reach 0.01btc.  
  
I’ve been using their services for years, they’re legit! Happy mining!

Nice! It gets even easier to spend basically anywhere if you can find a card service. (Depending on your area). Here in NJ USA I use Coinbase as a secondary "wallet" because I get a debit card through a company named Shift. I leave my spending money (Not my HODL wallets) in CoinBase and I'm able to spend instantly anywhere that VISA is accepted. It's actually very reliable and I've only had one mishap out of the 50+ transactions I've made with it. Idk if they offer Shift cards in Poland, I can see that Visa is accepted there so that would be great.
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:12:54
Yea :( Unfortunately all the big mining companies that folded, did so in an ugly way. This one wasn't nearly as ugly as when Josh Garza's GAWMiners went down, now that was a shit show if I've ever seen one.
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:39:37
Keep holding it down OP! I'm still HODL'ing here too, ever since I accidentally stumbled upon this currency back a few years ago.
I was working a crap job as a Staples computer repair tech, and one of the other techs started talking about BTC. We had a couple of "extra garbage" computers laying around so he showed me how to CPU mine with them and explained to me that this could be used as actual currency. Of course I was instantly interested that I could "generate" a couple dollars here and there by letting my computer run. I read the whitepaper and researched as much as I could about this mysterious money.
I then got a little slick and hatched a plan to get ASICs. Staples rewards their peeons with these "Star Points" that they can exchange for stuff (including gift cards). I was a good slave and racked up many of these star points and cashed out for a bunch of Gift Cards. It was enough to preorder 3 1st wave GAW Fury miners. I mined a whole BTC in less than a year via NiceHash mining Scrypt using very little electricity. So in short, Staples basically gave me 4MH/s worth of Scrypt miners and 1BTC for "being a good boy".
Now that I'm working a much better job, I've been taking any extra funds that I wouldn't miss if lost and I've been buying more BTC with it, like a savings bank account. Over the long haul, BTC is always increasing in value, and much faster than any US savings bank would ever grow. For now I'm quite happy with how this turned out. However, I'll be honest this whole BU/Segwit feud as of recent has almost scared me into panic-selling too. 
I don't plan on directly selling for Fiat. Rather I'll indirectly do so by spending the BTC using a Bitcoin debit card or something someday when I'm comfortable enough with the growth to start spending it. What good is having any sum of money if you can't buy anything with it right? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:24:08
Hmm, I never noticed that 4% and have been mining with them for years... oh well. If Steam accepts Bitcoin directly (pretty sure they do) you should be able to send BTC to the address they provide to you during your transaction. This would be a yes to your question.

For the simple reason of: USD is worth less and less every year (due to inflation), BTC (and other leading Cryptocurrencies) are worth more and more every year (due to people being tired of dealing with inflation). Patience. This may be the best option at this very moment in time, but Crypto pioneers aren't concerned with now, rather with later.

-Yup, this guy up there knows- 
Just take a non-ethernet connected computer, boot a freshly created Ubuntu Live USB, NEVER connect to the internet, use a trusted offline generator (via usb, don't go online with this computer to get it) to generate your keys. Type in all kind of weird shit and move that mouse around in un-natural patterns. Print 2 or 3 copies of your newly generated paper wallets via a USB connected printer (no networking, no internet connected printers). These paper wallets go in a fireproof safe, like a Sentry or a firearm vault or something. One of them, take good namebrand clear tape and put it over the keys and QR codes to shield them from the air. The reason to do this to only one of them is just in case that tape yellows or deteriorates over time causing the key to be unreadable (unlikely if it's Scotch and not dollar store crap). The tape should actually preserve the print better against fading.
If you want to test out your offline generator to make sure it's not generating invalid wallet addresses, generate an additional wallet that you can send a small amount to like a few cents worth or something. You want to make sure you're not sending your life savings over to a wallet generated via an untested source.

Edit: to better place a timeframe, this was right before the BCH fork... maybe 3-4 days before.

I haven't heard of the Crypto "Tether" (I thought you mis-spelled Ether, but Googled it) but I have heard usually very good things about the dependability of ShapeShift and their trustworthiness. As long as you typed your wallet in correctly (Copy Paste), there might just be some kind of random delay. I'm not sure about the speed of that network since I'm unfamiliar with Tether, but I've had Bitcoin confirmations take a stupid about of time every once in a while.

If it weren't for your bank mishap, CoinBase would have been the way to go. A couple years ago, I had my account set up in minutes, set up my bank with the couple transaction verification, and bought like $10. Miner payouts and faucet payouts built up and I needed a way to spend it if I wanted to, Shift card to the rescue. Never had a transaction fail, not even once. They just ask for a lot of info upfront.

It's another potential Hard Fork coming along. I'm not sure what Chain it is set to split from (the Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash Chain) but it would essentially be free Cryptocurrency just like BCH was. So if you wait it out and then sell your BCH and Bitcoin Gold if/when that happens, you'll be able to add a nice little stack of extra BTC to that 8 you already have :) (or I mean if you want to you can hold the forked coins in new wallets as well)
Now, important, this was mentioned in 99hotdog's comment, you have to take some action to separate your forked currency. See, they're going to be at the same public and private key. You're going to want to set up a new Bitcoin Wallet, and a new BCH Wallet (you can do this on a Ledger Nano) You want to take the BCH and send it to a new split Bitcoin Cash wallet, and since now your private key will be exposed from moving the BCH, you'll want to send your BTC to a new wallet too just to be safe.

Still want a Ledger Nano S though...
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:28:43
I'll give you a crash course on the whole thing. So let's say you have 2BTC on Coinbase and you bought a shiny new Ledger Nano S. After the Ledger is set up, you can click on "receive" in the software to generate a wallet address. In Coinbase, you'll "Send Max" to this address to dump all of your Bitcoin to the Ledger. It will be slightly less than 2BTC since Coinbase takes their cut and charges you the transaction fee. Once you have your money on the Ledger, you can use "send" and "receive" in the software to send Bitcoin to someone, or receive Bitcoin from someone. If for whatever reason you want USD, you'll need to sell to an exchange. Let's use Coinbase again as the exchange. You'll send Bitcoin from your Ledger to your Coinbase wallet. You can then sell/withdraw using Coinbase to deposit USD into your checking account. I don't recommend doing this until BTC reaches very high value, since all of this sending back and forth costs quite a bit with the current transaction fees. To buy Bitcoin would be a similar process. Purchase Bitcoin from Coinbase using your checking account, and then send that Bitcoin to your Ledger for cold storage.

When you have your Bitcoin in Coinbase, you don't actually own your Bitcoin. Instead, you just own a promise from Coinbase that they will give it to you (kind of like a USD bank). If Coinbase ever disappears or goes Rogue, your BTC goes along with it. Taking your money out of an Exchange such as Coinbase to a wallet where you own/control both the public and private keys is what truly gives you ownership of your Bitcoin (for example a Ledger Nano S or a Trezor). It's not as easy to sell or spend, but that's the point, you seem to be planning on hanging onto that coin as a future investment. Another benefit of having your Bitcoin off the exchange, is that whenever there is a fork (such as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold), you will be awarded those cryptocurrencies, instead of the Exchange getting it. Keep in mind, when you are in control of your Bitcoin Wallet you are in control of the security of that wallet. Trust no one with your private key or wallet's recovery seed.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:58:59
The way their miner works, is that it will benchmark your GPU(s), calculate how much your rig will earn using each algorithm, and choose the most profitable algo on the fly. No user input or monitoring needed. You can disable the really crappy ones and maybe pick the top 3. For example, my AMD rig will automatically mine Dagger, then Equihash if Dagger's profitability drops, then Lyra2RE if both of those drop. Meanwhile my NVidia rig will mine Equihash primarily, and Lyra2RE if the Equihash drops.
If you want to make any money, you're going to want to use some pretty powerful GPU's such as the mighty 1080ti and AMD's top-tier Vega cards. I'm using RX580's since that's what was the best AMD out at the time. Keep in mind, GPU mining, you WILL NOT ROI. Make sure you have other uses for your GPU rig such as personal computing and gaming for it to be worth it.

The issue some people have with Antminers is that they are owned/manufactured by Bitmain and there is some drama going on with them and the whole blocksize debate and such. Problem is, they have pretty much cornered the mining market and (almost) no one has the balls (or money) to go up against them.
Flaming you would be of no help to anyone since just like you we all started somewhere with a million questions, the more on the train the merrier. The pools are endless, but my personal favorite is not necessarily a pool but a hashrate selling service called NiceHash. People essentially rent the hashing power from your GPU's and ASICS to use to Cloudmine. No matter what Algorithm you are mining, NiceHash will pay you out in BTC. They have never missed a payment in the several years I've been working with them and their servers are rock solid stable. I'm mining 3 completely different altcoins with them as we speak and making a nice BTC profit :)

Well, you have two options. Buy a Motherboard, some video cards, and the cheapest CPU and RAM that will run that motherboard. You'll be mining something like Equihash or DaggerHashimoto to make GPU money (selling those altcoins for BTC). The 2nd option is to pick up an ASIC for SHA256 or Scrypt, plug it in, point it to your pool of choice, and profit. The AntMiner S9 would be worth looking into since it provides the best cost to performance ratio. I'd have recommended a Spondoolies but sadly they bit the dust, I miss those things :(

When Bitcoin starts to reach prices that are unreachable by the average person we're gonna wish we invested more.

They are all worth a dollar each now (making me wish that I sat at the damn computer refreshing that faucet a lot more lol. Cheers!

It depends on the location. Canada has really cheap power (in some areas), and in the US Tennessee and Nevada offer some really cheap electricity too. For the most part though, mining straight SHA256 BTC is a serious battle. You're going up against all the farms. It might be better to get an ASIC for another algo like Scrypt or X11 as they are much more power efficient and provide better return due to lower difficulty.

Yea I missed out on that one too. I've been in the game since right after BTC broke $100. If I had known then what I know now there would have been some large loans taken out at the time haha

Ah, booo that blows.. Idk, for me anyway the end-user benefit is just knowing that you're a part of the beginning of something new, different, and exciting. That's always a nice feeling. Paying with BTC using something like Purse offers benefits due to the discount you receive but for Newegg I don't really have an answer lol

Seems like the past couple days it's only conveniently been down during the hard peaks and dips. For now I'll just leave that as a coincidence, but we'll see.

Yes I prefer that as well. Currently running the dedicated Arris that the ISP gave us along with a WRT3200ACM and it's heaven lol. I feel like the all in one devices are like a "jack of all/master of none"

I know they have your computers, but do you have a backup of your private key? (aka a paper wallet in a safe or a hardware wallet, etc?)
Couldn't you just boot up a linux machine on a public internet connection, dump your wallet into a tumbler and out to a new wallet? At this point at least you'll still have your funds, and they'll just have your computers.
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:22:54
If it ever hits $1,000,000 and seems to settle/plateau there. To me this is highly unlikely, but so was $1,000. If it hits there and looks to continue growing though I'll continue the HODL until the steam runs out. Hopefully by then we'll be able to easily spend directly instead of converting to fiat.

Oh yes I'm sure the server load would be significantly higher during those periods (the high trade volume is what's causing those price swings) but this has happened many times before and I was always able to login and use the CoinBase iPhone app. I'm sure that this time around it just became way too overwhelmed, but in the back of my mind there will always be that little voice saying it smells fishy lol. Actually come to think of it, there has been a huge onboarding lately so it makes sense that CoinBase's servers are dealing with a hell of a lot more people now.

I agree with the wallets stored off the computer. If you're worried about lack of redundancy, maybe make a backup copy and store it in a password protected RAR file on a flash drive then remove it from the computer, then put that flash drive in a safe place.
For novelty purposes I personally just printed out paper wallets and affixed the QR codes to RavenBit and Casascius coins.
@_date: 2017-05-15 16:32:07
When you make your new wallet, take that seed information and generate a text QR code with it. Keep this QR code in a safe place (like a vault). If you ever forget your seed, just whip out your phone and scan the QR code with any QR reader app like I-Nigma. Be careful about what QR generator you use, something offline would be ideal.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:55:55
I always wonder if my solution is satisfactory.. Stack of RavenBit coins. Anything of substantial value gets plopped into meticulously randomly generated paper wallets and hologram stickered to the coins (printed on archival paper with pigment based inks). Coins are vaulted in fireproof solid steel Firearms Vault that only I have the combination to.. Vault is bolted to ground.
Paper wallets are generated offline on a machine that has never had an internet connection, and using live USB Ubuntu.
Question: what benefits do a hardware wallet offer over my current method, and which hardware wallet is the one that is most liked for the most part?
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:40:31
Ok here are some "improper" but easy to understand descriptions..
Router: The name given to the device that these days is actually a Switch, Wireless Access Point, and Router in one (in most cases). A router by definition is a device that connects at least two networks and forwards packets between them.
Modem: The device that processes (demux as written above) the internet signal and feeds it to either a computer or to a network device (router, switch, wireless AP etc.) Some home use wireless routers have a modem built in.
Wireless Access Point: A device that takes a wired internet signal (ethernet) and transmits/receives the data wirelessly over 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz frequencies. These are frequently also built-into home "wireless routers". Dedicated Wireless AP's are usually connected to a switch or modem to use that internet connection.
Switch: A device with several ethernet ports that creates a local network. When an internet connection is fed to the switch, it will be shared to all the other devices connected to it. The devices connected to the switch can also share files, printers, and access other network devices such as security cameras.
Since it's common for the low-end rent-a-modem most people receive from their internet providers (Cable companies, Verizon Fios, Satellite providers, etc.) to be an all-in-one Modem, Router, Switch, and Wireless AP, a lot of people have this misconception that all of these things are just one in the same.

I see your point, however right now as adoption is in the early stages it's a little difficult to purchase things on the fly in your local scene in most places. In the meantime I'm using a hybrid of both Crypto and Fiat currency. When I swipe this thing I'm selling my BTC (using crypto) to someone who is buying my BTC with the fiat currency equivalent to what I'm buying from a place that does not yet accept Cryptocurrency. Although it's not a pure Crypto transaction, I'm still using the network, and technically still using BTC as a currency since a value was traded for another value. Fiat isn't going anywhere just yet, but Crypto is on the rise. This is the transitional period, so I don't exactly feel bad for using transitional money. I currently keep my pure BTC to BTC transactions between friends and colleagues.
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:27:39
Maybe try pointing your 4TH/s at NiceHash? Their fees have been pretty reasonable for me.
Just a guess with what I'm reading around the web, but maybe AntPool is purposely price gouging your transactions to get you all heated and to coerce you into supporting something like BU. Just a thought, I'm not an expert on this scaling debate back and forth, I usually try to stay out of it.
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:16:47
Mined my first (of several) full BTC when it was worth 250-300ish with GAWMINER ASICS that I was gifted from my employer (before Garza scammed the hell out of everyone), still buying dips and hodling (and still mining). Let's go to the moon!!1

When we're saying to dump your Fiat this isn't what we had in mind :)
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:35:00
I will, no shame. I dumped a couple hundred bucks worth of BTC into Litecoin when it was at $20. Rode the bubble up to $30 and dumped it all back into BTC. Not a bad little profit. I think LTC might have a 2nd little bubble when Segwit activates but I'm not so sure. I probably could have made more if I did this with ETH instead but oh well, profit is profit.
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:01:12
Very legit, I have all my altcoin ASICS and GPUs pointed at them and I'm currently banking over 0.12-0.13 BTC a month. They've never missed a payment, and never delayed a payment. They also pay out considerably higher than any other pool I've pointed at.
If Chrome doesn't let you download the miner, you can go to the downloads view and choose to keep the file anyway, it's clean.
You can also get realtime stats in a nicely put together graph, as well as estimated earnings by visiting this stats page (using your wallet address):

Purse is more like a marketplace with many defrauders as members (just like eBay). If you're a little extra cautious and not greedy with the discount you're looking for, most of the time you'll be just fine. I've gone through about 20 successful purchases and got burned once. It just matters who's hooking you up with the goods, and how they're obtaining them in the first place. However, if you're not the gambling type, I kinda don't recommend this service.
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:09:34
Well, Segwit is now officially active on LTC. Let's see what happens.

Hmm, I wonder why I never thought to do this before (after printing out all these paper wallets and sticking them to coins). It might look cleaner if you print it onto a blank address label instead so you don't have to use tape.

Well the Model 3 set to release next year or so is supposed to be in a price range very similar to the bulk of the Hybrids, EV's, Reverse Hybrids (Chevy Volt), etc. So you'll get there sooner than you think.
@_date: 2017-05-08 14:28:03
It might be worth doing so in the future because sweeping wallets seems to be getting more and more difficult. The more popular online hotwallets/exchanges seem to be slowly one by one dropping support for this. Coinbase no longer allows imports, Xapo doesn't, etc. I guess it's a good thing though because it removes my temptation to spend instead of Hodl, but it would be nice to not have to go through blockchain.info to Coinbase in order to spend using Shift, way too many unnecessary fees to bounce from place to place.
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:15:05
It makes the currency "stronger" since it's actually being used as a currency and not just as an investment commodity. The more we use it the more real it becomes in a sense.

From the looks of it they don't charge sales tax if you pay in Bitcoin (via the screenshot above) but then again maybe their shipping address is to a place where there isnt a sales tax? I'm not sure on this one, but that would be a benefit if that's the case.
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:04:15
Sorry to hear that.. I've been there. Do yourself a favor and go buy Acronis True Image 2017, use it to make a bootable USB drive for safekeeping. Then get yourself either an external hard drive (or a NAS-box if you have the money to pony up) that is larger or equal to your current drive. Have this thing make a backup image of your computer at least once a week at a minimum.
Then, one day when the shit hits the fan again, you can just boot from that USB stick, format your drive, install your backup image and hit the ground running. The investment is worth it, especially if you have crypto-wallets to lose.

It's your average HP Officejet AIO, but when I print these jobs I print them over USB vs wireless. I'll admit this wasn't me being cautious, but because Ubuntu hates printing wirelessly to my printer lol. Good point though I hadn't thought about that.

I bought the dip the other day when it dropped to like $1,900 I'm freakin' ready lol, but yes I agree there will be a serious correction afterward.

This guy I've been subscribed to for some time now, "Barnacules" (Jerry), a former upper level Microsoft programmer has been posting about Bitcoin related things every once in a while now with about 900,000 subscribers. Most of his stuff revolves around tech related reviews, 3d printing, etc. but every once in a while he busts out his ASICs and has a quick chat about Bitcoin. He also created some tutorials and introductions to Bitcoin ownership and mining back in the Spondoolies days. Thoooose were the daaaays
