He actually owns a lot of gold. Gold &amp; bonds are 20% of his portfolio. It’s funny his late wife always made him hold it because she didn’t want it all in stocks.

I mean if derivatives are offered they will pay you if you are bearish.  It seems like a good short to since so much of Bitcoins gain has happened in the last 6 months. Has a lot of downside.

Well overtime the dollar value is suppose to go up. Bitcoin is just much faster at growing than actual money. Since it is not affected by interest rates and only by adoption. It could go up forever as long as there are other currencies to trade for it.
