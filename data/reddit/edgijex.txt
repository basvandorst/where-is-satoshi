Are you available for an AMA?

All they could pull off is 9% in two months?

Inner harbor, near the convention center. Then have a yearly Bitcoin convention, where the convention center is filled with merchants.

Talk about going to the moon. If the president started buying lunch with Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:29:33
CNN has a new breaking story.
@_date: 2014-11-20 16:51:36
I think one bitcoin would be worth much more, at least like thee dogg. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:10:42
No money in this? Are you talking about INTERNET MONEY? Bullshit, I want some of that Internet Money now!!!
@_date: 2014-09-21 01:42:34
Yes, please post address

I use USAA for all my bitcoin purchases for over three years with the same account. No issue so far. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 17:16:33
Tax return didnt go to USAA account, but that would be the best option
@_date: 2015-02-06 17:11:13
I see there are many places, but what is the best place?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:27:20
Im willing to pay 800. I just asked this same question.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:58:53
More like 400% two month gain.....or would you like 6000% yearly gain. 
Stocks generally measure by the year. If Pepsi stock went up by 400% and then down 33% you would not say the company is about to die. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:19:55
An FBI agent could send that to his wallet and no one would be able to figure out where it went
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:09:41
I was looking forward to colbert saying. Bitcoin, you just recieved the colbert bump.
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:37:37
Paper wallets also?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:49:20
25 uBTC?. Aint nobody got time for that. People want a full bit coin to feel like part of the movement. If i could only afford 1% of a bitcoin I would not even buy. 
I would wait for a new currency to come out and invest in that. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:04:52
I was so excited about this too
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:50:44
That is over a million Bitcoins a year.
@_date: 2013-04-21 10:05:22
I could see me getting down voted to oblivion for not being the right religion or wearing the right clothes. Even on Reddit you need to conform to get Karma on a regular bases. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:02:29
What base?
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:12:03
In my wallet and when you want it just ask right?
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:16:52
Ride or die baby
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:14:33
@_date: 2013-04-18 12:29:16
You can only trade out Bticoin, no other currency including litecoins. They are lost.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:02:50
LOL, 4x returns. Aint nobody got time for that
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:04:50
A loan for .1 bitcoin?  10 bucks, really? If you need a loan for 10 dollars then you should not be thinking of investing. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:22:52
Explain yo self nigga
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:52:50
I really wanted him to say. Bitcoin users, you just got the colbert bump.
@_date: 2013-04-14 12:40:56
I bought from there 8 days ago and its still pending. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:04:21
I wonder how many of the top 100 still have access to the wallet or is it lost forever
@_date: 2013-04-18 12:27:04
You can only trade BTC out also. So any other currency is lost.

Would you say its not worth investing into mining gear anymore?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:37:27
Sounds like something a hotshot wall street banker would say.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:20:08
If you don't believe in it, then don't buy any. Word to your momma.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:02:17
Not if netflix just became illegal in a country where it was just exploding in. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 12:15:31
A website that lists exchanges that meet criteria and possibly ranks them by stars. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:27:23
Bitcoin has brand recognition mbtc sounds like an alt currency
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:08:20
How do you spend physical Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:44:58
Im still hyped up but have been unable to buy for 10 days :p
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:34:29

@_date: 2013-11-15 23:20:29
Yuffi stealing again for Wutai?
@_date: 2013-07-21 12:03:18
Whats a Bitcoin Orphan?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:47:08
Your last statement was my point. We need some stabilization so people will buy bitcoins and spend them on items. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:31:21
Could you explain why it is a bad idea please.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:15:03
I submitted, lets see if this works. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:28:26

@_date: 2013-12-01 16:23:19
Why make Billions, when we can make. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 12:44:43
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:01:19
Fuck dat guy homie, I aint buy bitcoins fo drugs
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:49:57

@_date: 2013-12-12 16:20:58
roughly a Bitcoin a year?
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:08:39
Damn it, they wont take my money. Is something I rarely say.
@_date: 2013-05-11 18:39:35
The one true god
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:14:59
Im still showing 160 on BTC.

@_date: 2013-12-02 05:10:17
Very nice. The hard part now is not selling it.
@_date: 2013-12-11 06:07:08
You are a bold man to post that here.
