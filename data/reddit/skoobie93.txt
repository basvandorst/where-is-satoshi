You may be right.  Those kids would then be ineligible for employment in the sciences, which would negatively impact their economic and social mobility.  This would create economic pressure on the parents to get with the program.
Trusting in the market's self-correcting mechanisms may not be as emotionally satisfying as immediately forcing other people to behave as you want them to, but over the long run it does produce social change that's sustainable and ultimately progressive.

It wouldn't work everywhere, but in many cases I bet you'd be surprised at how easy it is to pay for things in gold.

Yes, that may well happen if you pay for the house in USD.  Real estate is of particular interest to governments because so much of their power derives from the territorial monopoly on the use of force.  If you really insist on "owning" real estate, you will always have to deal with the filthy grubby hands of government.  Many freedom-loving individuals prefer to keep their wealth in more portable, private forms, as someone else already pointed out.

Those feckless dickheads can't even stop JP Morgan's manipulation of gold and silver on the CRIMEX.

I actually think that gold and silver would quickly re-establish as money in a post-apocalyptic world.  Basically I think civilization would revert to a historical model appropriate to whatever infrastructure and technology remain.  Even if that meant returning to a lifestyle like ancient Rome, there would be local strongmen with armies and headquarters, there would be farms and protection money paid to operate them, there would be something very much like taxation, and there would be a need for a medium of exchange with all the classic properties of money... just like there has been in every place and time, all throughout history.  
In the first few weeks after the bombs fall, food, water, and ammunition will reign supreme; but in the months and years after that, gold and silver will revert to their historic role.

Okay, they ban Bitcoin and then it simply vanishes, just like.... cannabis?

Maybe the sales tax will drive business from eBay to Silk Road?  I mean, there's no law that says you can **only** sell drugs there.

You're still thinking about BTC as a security rather than a currency.  
The point of a security is -- at some point -- to exchange it for dollars which go into your bank account.  As you point out, that bank account is fully under the control of the tax authorities.
But the point of a currency is to exchange it **directly** for goods and services.  This process is only taxable if the buyer and seller cooperate with the tax authorities.  BTC makes that cooperation optional.
