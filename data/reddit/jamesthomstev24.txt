So you are a conspiracy theorist. Got it
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:09:59
Lol what did you do
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:26:45
Lmfao I hope you are trolling and not actually this stupid
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:05:11
$8 fee though? Wtf
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:13:56
Lol why because he isn't a socialist? What did he do that you are so upset about 
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:25:26
I take everything with a grain of salt. Show me evidence and I'll change my opinion 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:09:32
That's not how it works whatsoever. The fork does nothing to change the amount of bitcoin you have. It replicates your keys as a new coin which you would now have possession of.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:56:42
Well then bittrex set you up for failure with that. Always check fees
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:18:32
Flawed how? None of want to use it as currency, it's a store of value
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:03:11
They were given to people with low credit that could not afford them. Because the market was increasing so rapidly they did not anticipate the crash which meant they no longer had the collateral of the house meaning they people in the mortgages would save money by defaulting on payemts to get out of the mortage. This is very irrelevant everyone was saying the loans were very poor decisions for years everyone knew it was stupid but mortgage brokers got greedy

Bch is garbage eat a dick

It's your only chance unless you steal someone's identity lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:10:37
That is exactly what I'm saying they knew they would get bailed out it's happened time after time again. I believe I'm arguing with a teenager, when you grow up you will understand regulation and government oversight is bad once you have to actually deal with it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:08:27
I did the exact same thing exile. Last Thursday traded my 26 Ltc to bitcoin. Missed out on 8k, shit happens
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:10:41

No you are taxed at the bracket of 460k 
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:51:32
Bitcoin atm. Use Google maps to find the closest one
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:49:38
You need edumacation
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:03:42
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:01:28
Quite the amount for you could be miniscule to some of us, but anyways, I would hold or trade for litecoin while it is down and then trade back when litecoin spikes up and bitcoin is down. That's what we have all been doing. Making gains everyday
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:46:51
I took me few hours but this was back in October, did they deny you or it's just taking a long time? If they deny you they would give you a reason why
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:56:08
How are you in college you sound retarded. Oh wait Anyone who has money can get in nowadays
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:30:14
Oh no 2014 all over again!! Wait what happened in 2014? There was no net neutrality until 2015.... please tell me what was so horrific about the internet in 2014
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:03:15
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:53:24
There is no explanation other than error. It isn't physically possible without error
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:29:38
Wow you're so hilarious you should be a comedian 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:57:56
90% of bitcoin investors don't give a damn about using it as a currency. Who sells an appreciating asset
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:20:07
I was not speaking of monopolized areas
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:32:14
I don't know anybody who voted for trump that regrets it. Did CNN tell you that? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:02:12
Nobody cares about buying stuff with bitcoin. It's an asset
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:52:32
If you don't have credit history it takes longer to verify  your ssn for tax purposes
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:51:32
It's took mine 24 hours. Don't stress it will get there
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:31:12
Buy in on bitcoin now still an opportunity. If you look back a year from now and it's at 100k you will be kicking yourself again 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:44:39
Because it can potentially speed up bitcoin mining and transactions because faster (and slower) internet speeds will now be available. It gives the consumer more say in their speeds. But it will hurt poor peoples speeds
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:26:33
Crash? Down 6% is considered a crash? Lmfao
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:15:58
They've been saying that since 2k
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:35:20
No problem bruh. Bitcoin is a failure as a form of currency yes but as an asset it is very far from failure 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:45:48
Never use low fees. Greedy fucker you deserve to wait lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:39:11
Not a good argument. So you're saying a regulation preventing banks from giving loans to low income citizens would be good? Low income citizens should never be able to buy a house. If the government didn't bail out the companies they gave out the mortgages then they wouldn't have taken the risks on those mortgages in the first place. Government minding its own business is always best in a free market
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:30:47
It's all good man I have plenty of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:55:09
What are you like 18 or 19 lol. Class action lawsuit ���� we should sue you for being so stupid ����������

If it was too late it wouldn't be moving upwards while I am typing right now
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:57:41
How much money are you holding? What bills do you have to pay? Will that money make or break you? There are so many factors to this question. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:19:23

Thanks obama
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:48:23
First off roger is a huge dbag. Also there is potential for bash to become centralized which why it is bad.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:19:45
You would be able to pay more for better speeds therefore speeding it up. Net neutrality kept all isp at the same speed. If you can pay to have a faster speed it will then be sped up
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:14:56
Alot was bad loans were being given to people who could never realistically pay them back. Lol tf that's not even comparable not even a little bit
