There's usually a huge difference in the audiences at post level and comment level. Check any contentious sounding yet upvoted default post, the OP will often be highly downvoted.
I guess it makes sense - the people that take the effort to wade through the comments section might be more inclined to fact search and be open to more varied opinions than the 'editorialized headlines' that so often get frontpaged by knee-jerking skim-readers.
Or I'm armchair hypothesizing. I'unno.

I didn't say tolerance. I just said they probably want more varied opinions than a "omg censorship" headline can provide. 
..and anyway, I don't blame them. Crassly crying censorship is silly. It's not like the mods are the government, they certainly don't answer to you.

I remember everyone I knew in high school reading them back in 2005, a year before this. They *were already* pretty big.
So uh, whatever came of the actual comic project? Did you pull an all-nighter and put something shitty together? That's what I always did, sans the explosm ass-whipping.
^(also, nice work taking it in your stride)
