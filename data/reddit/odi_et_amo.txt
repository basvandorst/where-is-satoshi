Here's a truth: What you think is the truth may not be the truth.

   It's not intended to be comprehensive. There's nuance in everything. Wait for 'five reasons bitcoin is the best thing ever'

I read that as: Many constructed elaborate stories behind the mystery, but really it wasn't that mysterious at all; i.e. it's him.

Despite being annoyed receiving those unsolicited calls (with you on that!), you'd have to be a pretty stupid business owner to not pay attention if you did indeed start receiving that much interest for something.

I'm surprised at the overwhelming positive comments here. Does anyone not think this is a negative? The idea of someone very rich with an anti-Bitcoin agenda who wishes to flood a market full of drugs with a Bitcoin logo isn't too far fetched. We're already associated with Silk Road. Imagine what this would do to the public perception if it makes the press. The majority of people will read a headline and reinforce the idea that they don't want to get involved in "Bitcoin"...

My experiences with them have been fine. A little slow compared to coinex.pw but still no problems so far with over 50 trades.

Imagine the headlines: "Anonymous crypto-ATM in gun store"...

To be clear, would this mean the "report $4.92 of capital gains" mean you have to pay $4.92 in tax? Or is it 13 / 15% of the $4.92?

This is why bitcoin payment mechanisms absolutely need to provide a buy back BTC facility for the customer.

Thanks. Hit 17.7 now.

Sorry if this is a stupid question, but how can the market cap be higher in China?

If we're going by history, that'll be in another 3 years time then ;) Prepare for the long hold!
