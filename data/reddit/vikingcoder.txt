For those too lazy to do the math at home, if you mined 50 BTC per week, for one year, and held until now, that would be worth...  drum roll...
$39,091,000 in USD.

ELI5 why the *fundamentals* of Bitcoin are better than the fundamentals of any shitcoin.
Answer: they're not.
CNN is entirely right to broadcast skepticism.  Your average Joe doesn't even own stock.  If they're going to buy something, Bitcoin is way, way, way down the list of sensible investment for them.
Given the hype Bitcoin received, it's not unreasonable to offer a very skeptical view of it.
I own a reasonable amount of BTC, and I'm slightly under water and holding.  But I have lots of other investments going.

Brilliant.  Stick to the Gold Standard.
Elon Musk's SpaceX lands on an asteroid that turns out to have three times as much gold in it as the entire planet Earth.
Then what the fuck is supposed to happen?
Because Gold is literally the basis of the economy, the economy *can't respond fast enough.*
Elon Musk acquires practically everything.

A few things, and they're all really important to me:
* It would be great if you could convert Wallet funds to and from Bitcoin.
* It would be great if you could change the currency on something you're purchasing to "Bitcoin" rather than USD, and use your collection of Bitcoin to pay for something instead.  Of course, the vendor would need to inform Google Wallet that they wanted to allow this.
* It would be *great* if you could *pay* for anything Google sells, using Bitcoin, *with no associated Google or Wallet account.*
The last one is the most important to me.  Picture Google Compute Engine, or Google App Engine, for instance.  I would love to be able to set up an application to run on Google's servers, and have it be paid for directly by sending funds to a Bitcoin address.  If the application is able to collect enough funds, it can keep running.
I could launch a service, allow people to set up accounts and pay their monthly dues, and the service should just keep running as long as users keep paying.  There's no need to tie any of this to a user's Google account.
If this service were running on open source code, someone could fork it, put in enough Bitcoin to launch their own server, and now there's a competitor.  If it provides better service, users will migrate to it.
In essence, I've created a non-profit corporation with no legal personhood behind it that can be sued.  If Google gets a valid take-down notice, they can shut down the service.  Otherwise, it lives as long as people pay for it.  If someone tries to file a DMCA notice, and the service figures out some way to honor it, automatically or through user action, then that's great.  But Google gets Safe Harbor protection, in any case.
There are services where you can buy Cloud Computer time using Bitcoin alone.  Google should get on this bandwagon.
As an ancillary service, it would be great if you could interrogate an application running on Google App Engine or Google Compute Engine, and get Google's assurance about what code is running on that machine.  Like, a complete audit.  That way, when you're signing up to be a user of one of these services, you can assure yourself that some user doesn't have a backdoor to run off with all the Bitcoins.

I enjoy polite conversation, but I'm *baffled* that you would put the words "you want laws to force Target."
Where on Earth did you get that?
I'm proposing a protocol for digital gift cards, and markets that allow us to exchange them.  I think Target would want to participate in that.
How you got from that to "laws to force" businesses is completely beyond me.
I believe the system I propose has lots of pros I like, not many cons I dislike, and would be beneficial to people.
As a person with substantial income and wealth myself, yes, I think the very wealthy (individuals and corporations) hold levels of political and economic power that are harmful to most people, and often use their power to actively harm others.  I think there are a variety of ways to mitigate these problems, not least of which is slowly abandoning central currencies like the US Dollar.
Would you like to continue a polite conversation, or do you want to keep inventing ridiculous positions and pretend I hold them?
@_date: 2018-10-22 19:44:18
I want them to have gift cards.  They do gift cards today.  It's in their interest to have people buy gift cards.  The fact they voluntarily issue gift cards today is proof of that.
I'm suggesting it's in their interest to allow me to trade my Menards card into a Target card.  Or to allow me to pay someone using my Target card, so that then that other person will have the Target card to spend.
If Target screws up their ledger, of how much each gift card has on it, then everyone gets pissed and notices.  Target (working with what, Visa?) already has that problem today.
I'm also suggesting that this protocol and market that I'm proposing could be implemented on a small-scale, local basis, and could scale out.  Eventually brick-and-mortar stores, and online stores, will *want* to participate.
Much like many stores have played with accepting BTC.  We're not using laws to force Target to accept BTC.

It's not for sure that those are the only two choices.
And Bitcoin is far more centralized than most people are willing to admit.
The best alternative I know is digital gift cards backed by online stores, after they implement better verification mechanisms...  And then a market that lets you trade from one to another.  That's the best I can think of.
@_date: 2018-10-21 18:19:18
I own BTC.  But I fucking hate proof-of-work.  I pray something better comes along, soon.
@_date: 2018-10-22 11:56:23
Because anyone can issue gift cards.  Your local food co-op.  Your college.  The kid who mows lawns.
The protocol and APIs matter, of course.  Being backed by someone who provides a good or a service is smart.  And having markets for exchanges is awesome.
@_date: 2018-10-22 17:21:24
Yes, I explicitly want a market.
Toys R Us and Sears Gift Cards aren't doing so well just now.  The only people who want them are people who are planning immediately to purchase, probably in the store, holding an item in their hands.  Everyone else is dumping them on the market, probably at big losses.
@_date: 2018-10-22 17:41:59
Sure, that's one possibility.
But I don't mind if Target keeps their own ledger.  And if it's not distributed.  And if it doesn't use proof of work.
I want it to be fast, I want it to have low overhead cost.  I want a market to change Target credits into Menards credits.
I want to split my Target card up into separate smaller Target cards, and give you a digital card to pay for something.  When you receive it, you immediately tell Target to change my card into a new card for you, that I have no access to.  (Or you ask Target to merge the new digital card with a digital card you have.)
If you don't want Target cards, you have your selection of cards you do accept.  We find a market that helps convert my cards into your cards.  We haggle over the price, based on the exchange rates.
In reality, I want something that can be exchanged for goods and services, can be used "securely" (nothing is truly secure), and has low overhead.
Physical Gift Cards do all of those things fairly well, except they're a pain in the ass to exchange between people on the internet, or to turn one kind of gift card into another.
Adding protocols to enable that would not be hard.  It's just a standard.  Sure, it allows for money laundering, but so does BTC, and so do physical gift cards.
Also, with the system I envision, I'm not making a handful of assholes rich because of the Pyramid Scheme of BTC, crypto coins.
I'm making another handful of assholes rich : businesses.
But I'm doing it in a way that I think democratizes down all the way to small businesses, and individuals, in the most reasonable way possible: with exchange markets.
I'm also not susceptible to a PoW 51% attack.

Walk me through this, I get you to sell me $10,000,000 worth of goods.  I send you BTC, then you give me the goods.  I drive away.
At about the same time, I'm spending $405,516 per hour to make a 51% attack on BTC for as long as it takes.  I reverse the transaction.
I just made about $9,000,000 for my efforts.

That seems subjective, and ignores the case of very large transfers.
As of Jun 9, 2018:




Searching reddit, the takeaway seems to be that yes, you could destroy any proof-of-work system, including BTC, but you couldn't realistically double-spend with one as big as BTC.  So you could try to short BTC.  And depending on where you live, that may be illegal.
If you care to link to articles that you think adequately express your viewpoint, I'd be delighted to read them.
If you care to suggest other search engines, or other search terms, I'd be delighted to do more research.


In case it matters to you, when I execute the same search in a New Incognito Window in Chrome, on Google.com, I get many of the exact same results returned.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:02:07


* "I am almost embarrassed on your behalf"
* "I'm here to call out bullshit when I see it."
* "Triggered."
* "I feel that you are just taking the piss and are partially brain dead"
* "Ising wndoze and gooooogle and chrome ?!?!?!?"
If your intention was a scholarly discussion, I advise you to avoid phrases like those.  If you'd care to discuss why each one was a detraction from our conversation, I'd be glad to explain my perspective.


I did.  My conclusion is that the odds are greater than zero of a 51% attack on BTC.  That seems to be your conclusion as well.  So why all the rehashing?


I repeatedly, desperately, emphatically asked you to offer any evidence or suggestions as to how I should improve my search.  If you are not satisfied that I have demonstrated my willingness to look at the matter from a different perspective, I suggest you re-read my posts.  Note that I repeatedly asked for advice.
And you promised to help. And you didn't provide it.  You cited nothing.  You offered no new ideas for search engines or search terms.  You just typed more words.


That's not what makes you a dick.
What makes you a dick is your language and attitude.
Unless you have mental health issues (diagnosed or not), you are absolutely in charge of your language and attitude.
And I'll note, **you finally admitted the same conclusion I asserted originally.**
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:16:48
It's disappointing that you cited nothing.


Unless there's a fundamental difference, it's just a difference of *scale.*  By which I mean cost.


Really?  "ridiculous"?  How about "scholarly"?  If you are in fact open to understanding 51% attacks, you would study how they work - or fail - in similar circumstances.
Hell, you should *thank* all of the Shitcoins for existing, because they're doing the boots-on-the-ground research that shows how these attacks can play out in real life.
To your point, BTC is different, but it's really only substantively different in *scale*.  That means comparing to smaller networks is very informative.


That's demonstrably not true.  There are things called "forums" where people talk.  You may have heard of them.


That's also demonstrably not true.  Miners live in countries, bound by laws, and often with common ideological goals.
What percentage of BTC is held by someone who would self-identify as "Libertarian," versus the population of self-identified Libertarians in the general populace?  I'd wager it's higher.
And we live in a world economy, with super-power militaries.  Like it or not, we are all bound in many ways, including economically.
Hell, I just watched a TED talk last night, where a scientist was predicting the chances and consequences of a solar flair wiping out *most of the power grid in the US,* all at once.
Black Swan events happen.
If that kind of disaster struck, say, half of the miners in the world?  It'd have a possibly huge impact on BTC.
Bitcoin miners, and pools, are demonstrably economically bound.


If I were performing a 51% attack and had the funding to do it, all of my resources would be organized.
So...  what's ludicrous about that?


So, after all of your bluster, you admit that money can actually do it.
Then you switch to asserting that the fundamental problem is secrecy?
Sorry, but that's nonsense.
There are totalitarian regimes, where information does not go in or out.


Then while all of the bluster?  Why all of the harsh words directed at me?  Why have you spent so much effort trying to convince me I'm not just wrong, but wilfully mis-informed, and calling me "partially brain dead"?


You finish by saying "the danger... still exists," and "chances of meaningful success is very low (not zero)."
Why all of this negativity directed towards me?  I remind you, my initial assertion was:


TL;DR: You're a dick.

Something like 78% of all desktop computers are running some version of Windows.
Google search has something like 60% of all searches.
And Chrome has something like 66% market share.
I asserted that DDG and Incognito Google Search gave very similar results for my queries.  If you think other search engines give better results for these kinds of queries, I'd be glad to try and compare.
Are you asserting there are differences in the quality of the search results, depending on the operating system and browser you use?
Or are you just a gatekeeping "l33t" putz?

Again, any proof-of-work system is susceptible to 51% attacks.
That's a shitstorm horror show waiting to happen.


I don't think it's accurate to say it's possible to arbitrarily manipulate it.
The purchasing power of the gift cards is related both to the supply and demand of goods at the store, and also on the exchange market rates to other cards.
@_date: 2018-11-11 03:43:54
There's nothing special about "calling out" something without actually showing how it's wrong.
