Don't invest more than you can afford to lose!  
I invested $20 back in 2012, cashed out with a nice $40k CAD!
Still HODL'ing a little bit of coin, can't wait to see what the next 5 years brings!

Careful there bud, you might piss off the wrong person at the IRS and they'll classify your trading activities as a business.
I'd just send them the final totals of your capital gains, and just keep the transaction records in case of audit.

I wish rewards cards would just die.  
Your pretty much forced to use them, because the fees are built into everything you buy.
Visa are just a bunch of rent seeking assholes.

This ignores the fact that groups can pool their funds into a single transaction, or rely on the financial services industry to open a channel.
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:51:06
Careful. If you claim capital losses, the IRS will start digging into all the capital gains you failed to report from prior years.

If only there was an investment vehicle that could create liquidity, and drown out the pump and dumpers.   
The SEC should look into that. /S

All markets are cyclical over the long term. The only people who lose their shirt are the ones making stupid short term bets.

Agreed. We need more lightning posts

It'll be presented to the issuing bank within 5 days, but if the check is fraudulent the account holder can have the transaction reversed. Theoretically this can happen months after it clears.
There's a reason exchanges ask for so much ID to accept bank transfers.

Just keep your position sizes less than 5% of your portfolio balance.

Unless your private keys are protected by a TPM or HSM chip, this is about as secure as any random offline computer.

You would have to establish a snapshot through network consensus.  
The core team would publish a snapshot at a certain block height, along with the code they used to prune the chain. A hash of this snapshot would also be made public.
Once the community has sufficiently reviewed the snapshot for any funny business, nodes and miners can start signalling support for that snapshots hash.

Satoshi is waiting for Bitcoin to be more widely accepted, so he can buy a yacht

Lightning isn't solely a Bitcoin technology. We just reap the benefits.

Then how else will they just print money, and get alt-coin suckers to buy it?

Seriously. What a bunch of assholes these devs are.  
  
I know testnet coins are supposed to have no value, but real money went into mining them.

Creates liquidity, and keeps the buy ask spreads low.  
Good for loading up my lightning wallet :-)

Their insurer likely audited the entire operation with a fine toothed comb.
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:40:22
Negative fees would be an awesome mechanic. You would get paid for transactions that create liquidity.

Microsoft contributing to Lightning development is a pretty big deal.

LN routing will be very competitive. Since anyone can setup a node, high fee paths will be non-existent.

Or we can just change the Proof of Work, and go back to mining on CPU's again

The CBOE might have the clout to get this one approved.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:48:03
This is why you set the daily transaction limit, and don't send large funds over it.
@_date: 2018-07-23 23:18:22
I disagree. ETF's and big players will bring much needed liquidity and stability.  
There is no way market makers are going to risk their shirts on a pump and dump scheme.

Prefix announcements should be cryptographicly signed by the originating AS. if the route advertisement doesn't match Amazon's public key, it gets filtered.
At least thats how it should work.

Sadly, Electrum will probably need to file for a trademark to make this go away.
