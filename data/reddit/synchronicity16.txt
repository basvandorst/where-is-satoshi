I think the focus of the article is incorrect ... Bitcoin can easily be stopped ... Blockchain cannot !
As soon as a more popular and better technology crypto comes out then investors, speculators and miners will drop any of the existing coins ...
I wouldn't be surprised if the to 20 coins in 5 years time are coins we've never heard of.

It's a lot of rumour, could happen any time - they aren't going to announce when they will sell ... Looking forward to the day when $400m doesn't move the market

This is an issue for credible businesses and crypto's ... How do they reach their customers online if the main channels are blocking them..... ? 
Google/ Facebook are being lazy - how do they handle this in other markets? Ban car advertising ? Nope... there is something more going on ....

Waaa ... these guys kicked it and their move into AI is genius

I suspect that dodgy people can exchange farm credits for cash off line outside the game ... ? whether that market is big enough to be useful is another question

The more investment vehicles like this, that are bringing crypto's mainstream, the better :)

Crypto is like any new business 90% will fail .. It is likely that this year we'll see that very clearly .. so the emphasis for me has to be on quality

A lot of people think they are investing .. when really they are gambling ... jumping on FOMO / YOLO / peer pressure .... if you don't have a clear investment / trading strategy with clear entry and exit points and risk management defined then you are simply gambling ... 
Nothing wrong with gambling ... there is a problem when you think you are investing and you are actually gambling though ....

With Chinese companies it is often hard to tell if it is a scam or incompetence ....

Would be great to see comparative statistics ... change from day to day ... to last week ... e.g.a bar graph of the average each week of something
Thank you for posting

Great ... the sooner people are educated on this amazing tech the better ... meanwhile the skills shortage will pump salaries ....

I think the banks are running scared .... the blockchain is such a disruptive tech ... looking forward to a rebalancing of society that blockchain may bring

I think we need to understand the motivation of the person who wrote this? Pumping the stock? Getting paid per article? 
BTC Manager can you answer ?
It's clearly not an accurate reflection of this stocks performance or it's performance against the market ...
Look at square's chart and you'll see the bull run started 2 years ago and went parabolic way before november 17 ... in fact in Nov 17 it took a dive ...

I keep it in multiple wallets. I also print and store the keys etc  with my parents (or someone trusted) - just in case the wallets fail ... plus in the cloud in 2 places ... and on back ups ... should be enough I rekon
Great idea about using a multisig wallet

What is important is that Roland respected his own personal risk tolerance ... and the rest is history .... we make our decisions and the self responsible people accept the consequences - good or bad
