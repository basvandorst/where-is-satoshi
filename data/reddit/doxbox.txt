Can you buy a pizza with WoW gold?
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:15:17
Depends on where you are. I'm 100% certain there's a pizza place somewhere that accepts bitcoin.
But in any case you've missed my point.
The US government is concerned because cryptocurrency is basically a stupid easy way to hide money (read: avoid paying taxes) and there is no way to physically stop it.
They're not concerned with WoW gold or Eve ISK, because you can't exchange WoW gold or Eve ISK for something in the real world. If I have 5000 WoW gold, 5000 Eve ISK, and 5000 Bitcoins, I can use one of those to enrich myself, and the other two only inside the fictional economy of their respective game worlds.
Put it this way... I can get *something* physical in exchange for bitcoin, including cash. I cannot get something physical in exchange for WoW gold or Eve ISK. (Assuming you're not a chinese gold farmer)

Nah I'm just stirring shit up. But I'm also not trying to form a currency.

This whole thing just reeks of exactly the kind of thing that kept me away from bitcoin in the first place. Amateur bullshit.

Sorry but bitcoin doesn't replace standard currency. Sure it exists alongside it - bitcoin has even gone farther than I thought it would - but it can't replace it. Might as well flush any financial regulation down the toilet.

I'm sorry I couldn't hear you over the bickering between bitcoin factions. Could you speak up a bit?
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:36:47


NO, THEY WEREN'T. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT BEHIND MY COMMENT. THAT THOSE FACTORS WEREN'T AT PLAY BEHIND THE DOWNFALL OF ANY OF THOSE COMPANIES. THEY WERE ALL REPLACED WITH COMPANIES THAT SHARED THOSE SAME QUALITIES.
Maybe in all caps you will understand this.

Obviously they wouldn't just set up shop somewhere at random and hope the government there is more pliable. They would actively find a host country that is amenable to their aims.
It's not like there's some multi-government coalition of all nations against private spaceflight.

POTUS isn't a dictatorship, but no, I don't trust Trump to keep US currency stable.
But I don't think even he can tank the US dollar in the way Bitcoin can suddenly tank without notice. There are too many cogs and wheels working to keep the train on track for that kind of rapid inflation to happen.
Are you not even going to acknowledge that you just went apeshit about something I didn't say? Something like "Oh whoops I misinterpreted your post and thought you said inflation was good, but I recognize that you didn't say anything like that" 
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:37:40
I was only commenting on the relevant part of that post.
The fact that those companies were proprietary and owned by someone else had absolutely nothing to do with their decline, not for a single one of the mentioned examples. Further, every single example was replaced by something that also has those exact qualities - proprietary, owned by someone else.
If the guy's overall point still stands, or not, I don't really care, I just happened to see this post and I thought the logic was so terrible that I had to comment.

I think he's purposely banking on high employee turnaround. Fresh minds on problems.
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:57:47
Yahoo was replaced with something that is also proprietary and owned by someone. As was Myspace. And Nokia. And Digg.
Linux is a great example of FOSS being resilient to market forces, yes, but there are also countless examples of FOSS being inferior to paid alternatives, or FOSS that has gone extinct.

Okay first of all drop this stupid "you're fixating on the wrong aspect of their comment" nonsense. I've told you several times that my comment was referring specifically to the section of that comment that I had issue with.
Yes, it does matter that another private entity unseated the prior, because the point you (and they) are trying to make is that FOSS/open standards are more resilient.
The evidence cited does not support the point raised. It's perfectly normal and expected that private entities will come and go with time. Corporate entities failing does not mean FOSS or open standards are better, especially considering that I can name a LOT of failed FOSS projects and open standards that never saw adoption.
Mind you, I'm not saying they're *not* better, either. Just that the evidence cited does not support the point being made.
Like.. If I say I am a vegetarian and that makes me stronger than most people - the vegetarianism wouldn't be a significant contributor to any unusual strength, even if I were stronger than most people. (I'm not, this is just made up to show where the logic you're using is wrong)
Edit: Also the internet is not an open standard. I'm not sure who told you otherwise. Internet standards are decided by committee.

Okay but there's nothing backing Bitcoin either. It has proven to be far more volatile than any major fiat currency. I don't understand this point of view?
That's like... "Hm, the roof I'm standing on seems like it might be unstable. I'm gonna stand on this skylight instead."

What? SpaceX did design and build their rockets.
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:02:49
Also... 
Bitcoin is actually *lesser* than fiat currency.
It used to be that currencies were backed by gold and silver reserves, held by the country that issued the currency and paid out to the bearer of currency notes.
Some decades back, most of the world switched to fiat. Rather than backed by the gold and silver reserves of the country that issued the currency, they are backed by that government's credit rating. A bit more risky to hold currency, but still not backed by *nothing*.
Bitcoin is backed by nothing.
People act like it being non-fiat currency is a good thing, but, it's not. It's a house of cards. After the kickoff to the Great Depression in 1929, it was decided that in the event of an economic meltdown, trading could be halted to stem another possible crash. This has been used a few times since, and is probably the single biggest reason why we're not currently in the worst financial times in history resulting from 2007/2008's financial crashes.
With Bitcoin, there is no such measure now in place. The value can (and now has) dropped 50% in a matter of hours.
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:27:17
Uh, what? Bitcoin is most definitely being created. You know, mining?

I'm more than 100% certain that they could launch from any number of Western nations without interference. 
Especially considering that they *do this now*.

Actually I don't think Bitcoin even qualifies as a currency, let alone the best one.
It is a commodity. At best.
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:51:58
Truly you've never tried to withdraw such amounts of money because there's literally zero problem with doing so and banks don't care if you do.
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:03:28
Which, as a commodity based on something intangible, is fine for you to do.
But it doesn't work for a currency. You can't use a currency so unstable for anything critical - if you can't even predict the price of bread tomorrow, how can you base an economy off of that currency?
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:29:03
What the hell are you talking about? Where did I say "inflation is a good thing"? Or anything of the sort? Rampant inflation is terrible. That's specifically the point I was making, that Bitcoin doesn't have any protection against it. The value can plummet without any recourse. It already *has*. If people were actually using Bitcoin as a currency rather than a commodity, that would represent an overnight doubling in price of all goods and services.
Fiat currency has the advantage of a government working to ensure that the value doesn't drop like that. It's not perfect but it's better than completely no-holds-barred economic anarchy.
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:01:34
Yeah if the people who bought at $100 were the common use case then the price would never have gone up at all.
Have you ever heard the expression "this is not a zero sum game" in reference to economics? It's about how value is created, not just exchanged, when two people do business.
Purely speculation based economics is not like that. It IS zero-sum. No value is *created* with bitcoin, it just changes hands. Not just between traders directly, but overall over the entire network. If nobody was losing money on Bitcoin, nobody would gain money. Somebody has to be buying at the highs because that's what the highs are - the highest prices people were willing to pay for them. 
If you got in at $12,000, you're still completely and utterly fucked. And there are a lot of people who got in at that level.
Volatility in any direction is kryptonite for currency.
@_date: 2018-07-24 01:40:03
1) Nobody is telling you that gold bars are currency.
2) Even if people were telling you that, they would be wrong.
3) Bitcoin isn't currency. It isn't used as currency. It doesn't behave like currency. It isn't regulated as currency. It isn't currency. This isn't a judgement on my behalf, that's just the way it is.  It's closer to an investment platform than a currency.
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:42:36
Bitcoin just had more inflation over a two day period than any currency in history. Inflation is the drop in value of a currency, not the printing of more currency. 
More currency being printed will obviously cause inflation, but it's not the primary cause of inflation in most modern currencies because we have many, many examples of why printing more money only makes things worse.
Bitcoin is unstable. That's the fact. It goes up in value, it goes down in value, hard in both directions. It deflates (goes up in value, meaning you require less of it for the same purchase) or inflates (goes down in value, meaning you require more of it for the same purchase). It most certainly is not immune to inflation; it is in fact the prime example of the inflation that rampant speculation can cause.
