I disagree. If you really believe in Bitcoin you don't have those "fiat reserves" and you pay almost anything with bitcoin. The success of bitcoin merchants is ultimately what makes Bitcoin more attractive and valuable.

Exactly. If you know how to store your bitcoins securely you don't need to use them, but most people will probably accept some fees and limitations for the convenience of Coinbase. 
Coinbase is not the service for tech-savvy people. But it might be the service for your parents and your girlfriend (assuming that they are people who don't want to learn about Bitcoin to use it).

I think it's totally possible to buy ~2,000,000 BTC, if you're buying them over a few weeks on different exchanges, because many companies accepting BTC are cashing out instead of using them to pay for servers, advertisement, web designers, etc. (I don't really understand that, because they wouldn't have to pay taxes inside the bitcoin economy)

Hi, I started using Bitcoin almost 2 years ago and I didn't really "get rich" because of that. Many of those early adopters actually lost money to hacked Bitcoin exchanges and unreliable investments - I didn't, but I spent a lot of my Bitcoins a long time ago and I also donated some...

* How does it prevent MITM attacks in the meshnet?
* What happens if someone steals your card? Is there a password or something? Are your keys encrypted?
* How long does it take to verify a transaction? Is it secure, when only a single USB dongle confirms it?

Hi. If the fee is 1% and only one person pays me the 0.01 BTC and publishes the link; does it mean I have to add another file using the same address to receive the payment?
Edit: Ah, received a payout of 0.0094 BTC (and you paid a transaction fee of 0.0005 BTC as I just found out on blockexplorer)
It wasn't easy to find someone buying this file:

In some countries you can register domains without providing details (e.g. .to domains) - and you can also use services such as PrivacyShark…

That's not the point. Mt.Gox never holds really large amounts (they never had &gt;10% of the total BTC). Therefore they do not hold the majority of coins and they are not the only business trading BTC. They are just the most used trading platform, which doesn't make them a "monopoly"... 
@_date: 2011-11-28 20:51:35
I've watched the video and he says: you can (theoretically) find every nodes IP address by scanning the entire internet (4 billion IP addresses) on port 8333 (have fun doing this :p...), but this doesn't mean, that you can link any transactions to the IP address of a TOR user.....
@_date: 2011-12-20 17:43:00
maybe he should sell an instruction and material to build 'em yourself instead. so you are also safe, that he doesn't lose the public key to your coins.

Looks like you don't understand what monopoly means…

I've often traded on VirWoX and never had any issue directly related to their service (only indirectly due to an error of Paysafe, which was solved within a few hours), Their exchange rate is not the best you can get, but it's reliable.

Can I revoke the permissions of your site to access my accounts after confirming that they belong to me? I don't want many services having access to my profiles.
P.S. I'm getting an error when I try to connect Coinbase.
@_date: 2011-12-20 16:13:48
A beautiful morning? Yes for you, if you bought 'em cheaper than that.
It's not a good chart in general, because it shows me that the trades are very centralized on Mt.Gox (more centralized than a few days ago). IMHO Bitcoin is also going up too fast → risk of another bubble.
@_date: 2011-12-19 17:00:46

@_date: 2015-02-14 20:29:30


How could you miss that?
It was first announced on the [forum]( on January 20 2015 and since many people are not too active on the forums they also notified everyone via email:
**Subject:** Confirm Your Membership to Vote in Elections  
**Date:** Fri, 6 Feb 2015 19:41:14 +0000
It was also part of the newsletter /twice/ and on the [blog](
Edit: It was actually mentioned more than twice in the newsletter, I didn't check all emails.
@_date: 2011-12-24 13:37:06
It's the Bitcoin address you can see on the left side of the article (I've scanned it with:  because my cell phone is too old).
@_date: 2015-02-20 20:37:58
This rule was well-known to all members. Harper &amp; Perklin are the candidates I want as board members and they will get my vote again. Their expertise might be useful, but even more importantly their ability to work together with current board members (Jim Harper already worked for the BF - Michael Perklin -&gt; DevCore)
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:39:27
It's mentioned several times in emails, on a blog and on the forum, if you didn't read any of those you probably don't really care about the Bitcoin Foundation. It's your fault.

BTC would be acceptable if Bitcoin becomes the currency of Bhutan.
EUR is also not really a standard symbol, because the EU is not a state and many EU member states are using other currencies (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, UK, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Sweden)

This is wrong because:
* you can't buy every bitcoin (see: evoorhees)
* the U.S. is basically bankrupt

Everything that has been asked, has already been addressed somewhere. 
The sidebar of this sub-reddit is a good point to start. 


Yes, but doing business in Bitcoin and supporting those who are already using it is even more important – it's great to know that there are other people who are aware of technical details, but it doesn't mean that everyone needs to  understand everything about it.
I guess most business owners that will accept your credit cards don't fully understand what happens when you pay with a credit card – but they're accepting them and focussing on their skills. 


Feel free to help filling them.
@_date: 2013-01-24 22:49:55
I think icbit.se allows shorting - if you wait for Mt.Gox to implement something it might take a long time.


Edit: Oh and this looks interesting too:

Yes, that's how it works

They had some technical problems and the developer disappeared, but feel free to fix it if you can: 
I spent ~30 BTC there. Now that'd be worth more, but I don't regret it.

@_date: 2013-03-07 20:32:51


While this is technically true, I want to remind you about the [reddiquette]( Reddit accepts Bitcoin and I don't want them to stop this, because some "Bitcoin people" were asking for upvotes. Just wait for it. People will find us. Bitcoin won't "die" if it takes a bit longer for others to find out about it. 
You didn't ask for it directly, but you're clearly suggesting it.
@_date: 2013-03-17 15:35:29


There was a reddit-like community where almost everything was tied to small bitcoin payments (post creation, responses, upvotes, creating a subboard). It was called witcoin. It was awesome, but the developer seems to be gone.
btw.: the developer was and afaik the last owner of the server was @_date: 2013-02-09 17:43:49




We don't know the exact number of coins in circulation (afaik it's not possible to find out the amount of destroyed bitcoins), but we can easily find out the exact limit of bitcoins in existence at any time (currently 10,759,325 BTC)

Maybe regulations and laws in the US are a problem for them. Does Paymium / Bitcoin Central offer a similar service for European merchants?
@_date: 2013-03-18 20:00:06
Well, it could be true even if it doesn't appear on the charts. Buying up $1,000,000 at Mt.Gox would be very expensive compared to a direct trade with someone who owns $1,000,000 worth of BTC....but I think you're right!

Underpinning the value of gold is that it's rare. Who would like those shiny things, if that was associated with failure and poverty? 
Being a rare element makes it interesting to us, because we like having things that are difficult to acquire - it symbolizes that you're a winner and makes you feel great. 


What if 100 million Americans stopped working for USD? Then it would suddenly be much less valuable and maybe other people would stop using it too.... who would be working for this government to collect taxes if it makes horrible decisions?
