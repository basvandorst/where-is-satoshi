But... are everybody hodlers? No! Those 9,900 people with 9,870,340 BTC should expense them some day, aren't they?
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:48:49
My guess is that 1 BTC will be worth 1 BTC

I missed the dip. Again.

Exactly. The screenshot shows healthy development vs non-healthy development.

Yeah, it is impossible for someone as smart as Gavin could be tricked by Wright. Gavin and Wright purposefully wanted to cheat everybody.

It is really funny to see 
Profitability is starting to go down!
Look at those big blocks! 0.21kb!

Being a programmer, he probably meant:
If (unlikely ( BCH hashpower &gt; BTC))...

add "Original Satoshi" and I'm in.

No, see

The quote you cite from "the benefits of segwit" is part of the problem exposition. It is precisely a problem that segwit fixes. With segwit the txid wont't change ever (and the transaction contents itself also will never change, but that also has always been ensured without segwit).

Signaling for segwit2x implies supporting segwit. That is the first part of segwit2x. You can't do the second part without doing the first part. If you support the second part, you support the first part. 
That's how they defined it. They could have gone directly to the 2x part but for some weird (and dishonest)) reason they included the first part.

Signaling for BIP91 means what it is: support for BIP91 (which clearly says "Segwit increases the blocksize, fixes transaction malleability, and makes scripting easier to upgrade as well as bringing many other benefits."). 
If they are not supporting BIP91, why signal it, then? That's dishonest for me.

Is this the same content than email?

We should all run the first version of Satoshi's code too. There's nothing closer to initial whitepaper than that

I think the part that is harmful is that it is patented. If everybody could "skip doing work" then it would be fair. But the patent prevents others to skip work, so it is an unfair advantage.

It doesn't matter if it is overt or covert. It is the fact that it is patented that hurts the mining economy in an unfair way.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:10:51
It is patented.
