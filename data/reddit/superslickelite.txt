Look up $HMNY and put the chart next to a Bitcoin chart. Welcome to the same world. 
As far as the wolf of Wall Street comment, that dude did some horribly bad and illegal shit to alot of people. Understanding proper risk management and technicals can be more than enough. Look at Tim Grittani or Steven Dux. Or Roland Wolf or Mark Crook or Michael Goode or Tim Sykes or most recently Michael Hudson and Mason Fecht. You can call a bluff all you want but it's kind of awkward to do that and then go to profit.ly and see literally thousands of verified broker trades and data.. ��
Also I don't keep a "portfolio". I'm never in anything longer than a day or two.
Also that came off aggressive, it wasn't haha.
I'm busy in what ever is moving and has volatility, and I'm way more comfortable in nasdaqs and otcs than I am in crypto, my point is that the price action is identical to a pump and dump and there for should be played like one.

The last 4 words of your comment honestly changed the tone in my head haha I was ready to go full face palm. My recommendation is to only trade what's in play and piggie back it. Crypto is too hype based in my opinion, so are penny stocks but at least a penny stock has sec filings and I can see plain as day which ones are scams and catch the middle.
I see many in this sub talking about buying dips but they don't understand what to do after they buy a dip. Who gives a shit if you bought all the dips on the way down, congrats, you lost. Where's your risk? Without a defined risk and exit point it's gambling, not trading or investing. Statistically speaking (there's an actual proven percentage) new traders/investors have a better win percentage if they were to just roll the dice and randomly buy or short then they would if they tried to predict.
I bought my first Bitcoin Dec 1st on the break of $10,000 and sold it mid 15's 6 days later scaling out. My risk was $9400. That's an 8:1 risk reward. Haven't touched crypto since. If you put the btc chart next to a penny stock pump and dump it's identical. Hyper inflation followed by a dump and continuous selling, fueled by the hopes of the uneducated expecting it to go back up. Look at $HMNY. $4-$34 in a few days and after a 1:250 reverse split it now trades at $0.015. one and a half pennies. From $34. Crypto is entirely hype based. There is no predicting, the only way it tradable is that human nature is consistent and therefore creates a self fulfilling pattern.
So my recommendation would be, if you want to trade with calculated risk and actually make money, don't start with something so random like crypto. Trade the easy junk. I make a healthy living trading garbage. Most companies exist only on paper or only to sell their own stock.

Who ever is still holding from last November needs to be hit. This hodl shit is how all of you have lost so much money. Nothing can infinitely increase. Blows my mind how many people buy into crypto not understanding even the most basic principles of trading or investing and they just rely on what the "pros" say. Example: Jim Cramer is only right around 30% of the time if you track it. Yet people gobble it up like he's king. I trade the worst of the worst, penny stocks that can at times get up to 800-1,000% in one day, and people are still chasing it at the top. It's foolishness. Take your profits. You can always buy again.

&lt;Did the Us dollar collapse 89% in the last year?&gt;
100 years is very different than 1... ����‍♂️

What happened was a pump, every single news outlet in the world was talking about it. If every news outlet in the world started talking about EUR/USD and how it was projected to reach 1/10,000 by the end of the year it would do the same thing. Bitcoins "purchasing power" is based on hype. It has a place I'm not arguing that, it's a better option than credit cards, but to say that it is sound money when it goes from $5,000 to $20,000 and back down in a year is foolish. It will become sound as soon as it's adopted more and easier to exchange with the majority of society at which point it won't be worth anywhere near this much because it will be in greater supply. Limited supply is what created the surge, so comparing it to something that the government just prints for fun these days isn't very equal.

If that works for you then sweet haha I'm too much of a control freak, I need calculated risk.

Why? Did the Us dollar collapse 89% in the last year reaping destruction on hundreds of thousands of people?

YouTube is a good free start. Investors underground, madaz trader, Tim Sykes, all good starting points. Investors underground is awesome, Tim has more material than anyone and proven track records over 20 years + multiple millionaire students all on profit.ly . Tim is very show boaty and kinda douchey at times but it's all 100% real and honest. Madazs content is also really good, I've never paid for any of his stuff. Just freebies on YouTube. Profitly has roughly 600-700+ hours of study material. But you have to pay for it.. Obviously. Well worth it. I got Tim Grittanis DVD called Trading Tickers for $897, and with in 3 trades made that all back plus more now that I have the knowledge. I would start with the how to make millions DVD. Watch it 2-3 times. Its 35 hours. And then get Grittanis DVD. Incredible information. 
Now, queue all the hate comments for pitching Tim Sykes:

"you're short sighted if you think this 12 or 18 month snap shot of btc and crypto means anything" 
You lost me.... Are you saying it means something... Or that it doesn't...
I'm short sighted to think it means something... Would mean that it means nothing. So it's worthless.... But you're saying it IS worth something.. 
Not being rude haha that part just hung me up..

Oh yeah I agree. There's definitely a place for it. My main point was for the people buying it on every dip hoping to suddenly be rich. It's pure gambling. Crypto does have a place for sure. Unfortunately alot of people treat crypto/forex/stocks/options/futures etc as a lottery ticket and just throw money away. Which I'll gladly take from them. New comers provide all the liquidity for the veteran traders.

Not at all non sense. As a long time career trader, I can tell you history repeats, the price doesn't move unless the buyers show up, it went to 20k BECAUSE it broke 10. Even handle numbers - 1k 5k 10k 20k etc - in the human mind are big deals. Look back to when it broke 10. EVERYONE bought. And this next time will be even bigger, because everyone that didn't buy the first time now have a bad case of FOMO. (Fear of missing out). So people that have never traded in their lives and have no place buying crypto will be pouring in like gas on a fire.
