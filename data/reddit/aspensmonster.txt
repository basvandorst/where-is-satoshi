Because the AGPL is about [Freedom]( --as are several other licenses provided by the FSF. The "Open Source" community was created specifically so they didn't have to comply with the spirit of the Four Freedoms with respect to software:
* Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
* Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
* Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
* Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.
Ultimately, it comes down to a question of whether you believe that the users have those freedoms --or rights, if you will-- entailed above, or not. If you believe they do, then it is unethical to deny the users those rights. And consequently, choosing a [permissive]( license that doesn't enforce those rights in a [copyleft]( manner --like the permissive, non-copyleft MIT License-- is a mistake, at least from the perspective of ensuring the users' freedom. It exposes your users to malicious middlemen that take the technically-free software, make modifications, and then deny their own users one or more of the Four Freedoms, often all of them.
Bitcoin itself is permissively licensed, and these exact sorts of scenarios play out as a result. This is the essence and spirit of the "Open Source" movement. They either do not believe that users have those freedoms, or else think that the users do, but fail to see the logical disconnect in insisting that developers of software have the "freedom" to deny users *their* freedom.

So... the ads are *surrounding* the content? That can hardly be described as "out of the way."
In any case, advertising is categorically a bad thing (Stow your pitchforks, folks: I'm truly speaking of *advertising specifically* and not communication in general). It is designed to subvert your sense of skepticism by any means necessary in order to get you to behave in a way that is beneficial to the advertiser. Whether or not the benefit happens to be mutual in any particular case or context is irrelevant. There is a bias present in every act of advertising that underpins the behaviours of the advertiser and fosters a relationship that, fundamentally, treats you as a means rather than an end.
Now, I do donate to content creators and other service providers in lieu of being subjected to advertising. However, I doubt ads will ever go away. There is far, *far* more money to be made in advertising than in subscriptions or donations or other payment models. And that, in my mind, is a great offense: that I am *willfully* treated --insofar as a decision is consciously made to deny an ad-free alternative on the grounds that there is *more* money to be made with ads-- as a *means* rather than an *end*.
Suffice it to say... I'll keep my ad blocker on.

Sorry, you'll have to clarify: do you consider such an ad so pointless as to effectively be blocked, or are you simply commenting about my usage of ad block without concern for my interpretation of whether an ad is "intrusive" or not? Of course, I don't object to ads because of their intrusiveness; it's far more deep-seated than that, as I have amply described. But I'd still like to know what you think of my definition of an ad that is "non-intrusive"/"out of the way":

Why not give the OP the benefit of the doubt by interpreting his position charitably? "Harm" needn't be physical. The "harm" could simply be risk of some unfavorable outcome that is deemed unacceptable. The drunk driver commits a crime because he imposes an unacceptable risk upon others of injury. Granted, what exactly "unacceptable" is, and what exactly "unfavorable outcome" is, and who gets to "deem" it so, is its own can of worms.
The intersection of law and ethics is complicated.

I think it takes a very generous interpretation of the phrase "out of the way" to believe that a set of banner ads that surrounds the content is "not in the way" of the content. Sure, you could claim that Banner Blindness makes the ads effectively "out of the way," but the obvious intent of such an arrangement is that the user will both have to visually examine them during the course of navigating the page, and will continually have them "in [their peripheral vision]," lengthening exposure time. Such an arrangement is just as "in your face" as a preview ad. It's just a different style.
I'd consider an ad "out of the way" if it was a single, small ad, somewhere below the fold, that is clearly marked as an ad and doesn't work itself into the typical UI/UX of the page. I'd still dislike it, but that would qualify as "out of the way" to me.

I've argued that advertising is unethical, in that it treats your audience as a means rather than an end. Advertisements are categorically bad for this reason. An "enable by default" policy is a behaviour that treats the audience as a means (there are of course other, more technical, issues with an "enable by default" policy such as malware distribution, but those are ancillary). It is an attempt to extract some sort of value off of each and every viewer, as though the content were an entree at a restaurant and each viewer were a patron that took a few bites. But ideas are not property or even physical in any typical sense, and are not obligated some form of compensation by mere virtue of having been examined; nothing has been "lost" or "consumed" in the traditional sense by mere observation of an idea's manifestation (be it a picture, a film, a book, etc). When, precisely (if ever), such a compensation is *obligated* is quite a hot topic, but the standard notions that guide traditional property law are grossly inadequate for investigating the matter.


Advertisement is not the only source of money. Bitcoin, flattr, donations, subscriptions --these are all means of supporting creators that do not carry the same ethical baggage that advertising does.

Intellectual property really is an oxymoron. We cannot own and package ideas in the way we own and package traditional property. They are fundamentally different things, and require an entirely different approach to analysis. Content can never be "stolen" in the manner implied, because content does not "belong" to anyone; content merely has an author. The author can certainly be said to deserve compensation for his work, but he's not entitled to control of the minds of others in service of that desert, because such manipulation is unethical. I'm making an assertion that such manipulation is unethical because it treats the targets of its manipulation as a means rather than an end. The creator that regards his audience as a sea of captive eyeballs available to the highest bidder, rather than a group of equals with whom there is a mutual desire for connection and contact, is a creator that has a broad misunderstanding of his purpose at best. At worst, he is a creator for an all-together different audience (the advertisers).
To the extent that the notion of a "contract" makes any sense at all in the context of intellectual property, such a contract is inherently unethical if you hold that one should treat others as an end. Artists and journalists --creators of all stripes, really-- cannot make a claim to be creating in service of their supposed audience while they simultaneously align themselves with advertisers. Any "implied contract" based on such unethical grounds is invalid to start. Using an ad blocker to guard against such hostility (however subtle and seemingly benign) is a reasonable response in the face of others that seek to treat you as a mere means.
But the notion of fairness, of being compensated for the part you played in the happiness and satisfaction of others, still stands and resonates with widely held virtues. I've been entirely deontological up until this point, but reality is not so rigid: a world where content creators suffer perpetually as a consequence of the selfishness of others, is itself on shaky ethical footing. But notice, I said selfishness of *others*. A content creator that consciously chooses to generate revenue solely by means of advertising, by using his audience as a means, is digging his own hole. While I'd certainly prefer a world without advertisements at all, I see a situation where the creators provide other means for claiming their deserts (means that respect me as an end) as preferable to a situation of staunch deontological rigidity with absolute disregard for consequence.
In practice, most of modern content creation seems to understand this ethical conundrum (at least implicitly) and has done a decent job of addressing it. While much of the 20th century left us chained to advertising in a truly insidious way, the advent of the internet --of the information age in general-- has done wonders for weakening the control that advertising once had. From [flattr]( to subscriptions, to donations (and of course bitcoin) creators have never had greater autonomy and potential to fund their own work without resorting to ethical compromise. I can't remember the last time I found a particular site that I both wanted to engage with, and that didn't have any alternative to advertisement as a means for generating revenue. Whether it's purchasing a subscription, flattring something, donating to a twitch streamer, backing a kickstarter or indiegogo campaign, or even buying a bit of swag off a youtuber, it seems there's always an alternative to advertisement.
Perhaps advertisement still makes the lion's share of a creator's revenue each month. That's an ethical conundrum in itself. But it's a conundrum faced by the content creator at that point, and a compromise of sorts that doesn't leave me personally feeling quite so ethically queasy. And incidentally, it's an area where bitcoin and similar technologies could greatly assist in diversifying revenue sources :)

There is a class of license that prevents these shenanigans. When it comes to weak, non-enforcing, non-copyleft, "Open Source" licenses, this kind of behaviour isn't a bug. It's a feature; a feature that was actively selected for when Open Source split from Free Software.
