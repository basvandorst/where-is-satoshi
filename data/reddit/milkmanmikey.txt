Yeah, no one really cares about what individual people have, and they care less for seeing it posted up on here in an obvious boast, you’re like the incessant parent posting pics up of their kids - no one cares dude.
@_date: 2019-11-15 14:38:13
Kinda hard when you watch it day by day fucking tanking, sometimes you think fuck it and just want to cash in and short the fucker, then another side of you says to hodl.
I’m a long time hodler btw but fuck me it’s hard to justify it sometimes.
@_date: 2019-11-15 15:46:49
Or, if you see it tank day by day you short it every fucking day until it hits sustainable support. What you’re talking about by buying every time it tanks is a belief that it will go up again and be a sustainable world currency.

I like the cut of your jib
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:25:28
I had the money but not the knowledge or conviction then, even 6 moths ago my life and attention was spread way too thin. Only recently it’s slipped into my mainstream lifestyle. 
Kids, businesses, wife, social circle kept me busy. I’m here now though. Kicking myself a bit .
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:18:13
Mibbies aye and mibbies naw
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:18:15
Thanks for that, just downloaded it.
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:54:48
What risks am I open to by saying that I do?
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:34:44
Thanks brother. I like to dabble in poker and blackjack. Had great highs and terrible bad bears and lows - this is similar in endorphins I have to say. I love it. Keeps me alive.
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:37:43
I guess it is, check my post history on here, if the next couple of weeks go well I’ll be buying a lot more instalments of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:36:42
Maybe I’m naive? I’m not advocating full on disclosure but just a little more transparency. I think we could just be a little more open in our chit chat.
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:01:50
To the moon
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:04:22
I read comments in the discussion threads and it takes me the best part of a working day to read up on the terms and slang that’s being used. If I’d have to guess my knowledge here I’d say it’s about 4% of the 100. Just ordered myself another 4 books to chew through. Wild ride.
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:48:58
As a fairly newcomer, can you tell me how people go about raping your bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-29 11:24:47
Tell me more
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:21:57
A whole heartedly thousand thanks ��
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:48:04
Whatever doesn’t make you a millionaire will only make you stronger

Newbie here ����‍♂️ I drive a Kia X Class
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:19:10
Thank you for your input
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:52:56
What did I mess up?
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:52:03
What’s that now? Your input would be much appreciated.
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:53:15
What’s a larp?
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:51:07
Can you tell me how people go about getting their hands on my bitcoin and what I should look out for and pc/mobile safety tips please, it would be very much appreciated. I think I’m being a little foolish here.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:40:37
Link the app please, I’m getting nowhere trying to find it
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:59:04
Thanks for the useful reply, as habit would have it I don’t do any of those things, but that’s purely down to not being heavily involved in the internet as a whole. A thousand thanks for your reply ��
@_date: 2019-06-29 13:40:24
To the moon, buy the dip, gotta DCA, HODL, this guy bitcoins,
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:32:36
What’s significant here?
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:20:25
I don’t give a shit about that to be honest, let’s talk freely and converse to achieve a forward motion. 
It’s like a child covering his answers at school with his hand, fuck that, let’s be an open community.
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:34:14
I’ve got the funds and just really do believe this is going to go bananas
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:35:15
These are not the droids you are looking for
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:18:56
I just bought that an hour ago from someone else’s suggestion on here - great minds eh.
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:31:16
I’m a 34 year old guy from Edinburgh in Scotland with 2 young kids, no troll here my friend.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:51:10
I’ll take that on board, thanks for your 2 cents
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:52:43
Ok, I will do.
@_date: 2019-05-26 11:19:03
My god 10 to 15 X the ATH!!! Can you imagine that kind of return.
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:27:43
Thanks again for the input
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:37:04
Frozen accounts in exchanges, tell me more please. Why’s that?
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:59:50
I am definitely Alice today, and probs the next few months
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:58:09
Mega thanks, this will be the first thing I read, where it all began.
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:11:40
@_date: 2019-05-26 12:50:29
A thousand thanks for this advice.
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:34:04
Solid advice, buy and hold,
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:51:23
So “BTC” is what it goes by?
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:17:41
97.6% newb here, can you elaborate a little and ELI5, thanks for your input.
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:32:46
A thousand thanks ��
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:45:01
Thanks, I’ll go check it out.
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:37:27
The real MVP, I’ve got about 3 months worth of reading to do I think, can’t wait to start taking bite size pieces out of it. Thanks man
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:36:00
Ever? Big if true
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:36:01
So alt coins are garbage but bitcoin is the real deal?
@_date: 2019-05-26 11:12:28
Gotcha. Thanks
Edit: are there any analysts that you think are worth listening to &amp; who are they?
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:34:11
I’m not looking to wreck less or silly by any means, but I’m definitely looking for a wee something something
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:40:55
Jesus, I can’t wait to understand that in a couple of months time. Thank you for your time.
@_date: 2019-05-26 18:50:44
At least.
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:56:43
Will hopefully do all of these through time. Thanks for your input
@_date: 2019-05-26 11:14:16
I hope for a 30% dip so I can buy some cheaper bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:46:08
Thank you for this.
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:46:00
I’ve lost money before and been able to come to terms pretty quickly, not 51k mind you but I’m not the type of person that would do anything if I couldn’t handle it, like if I lost that money then it’s my fault so who cares? I think I’m going to start off with 1 BTC in a month or so once I’ve chewed through the basics with books n videos. Thanks for your time.
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:21:16
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:53:11
Thanks, what’s dca? Glad you’re back on top
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:22:11
Someone else just said that too, £17 so even if I get a little understanding from it it’ll be worth it.
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:04:34
Thanks, what’s a node
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:46:58
I’ll stay well clear then, Bitcoin it is.
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:55:59
Brilliant stuff, what’s ATH?
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:34:44
Holy Moly, that’s awesome, thanks man
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:05:13
Got them on a playlist already from other comments. Very much looking forward to putting headphones on and getting jacked in. Thanks
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:43:37
You’re talking so hip you’re really twisting my melon man.
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:15:50
Thanks for the heads up
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:28:21
I’m all about that mindset
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:41:48
Ha, I swithered whether I was going to put that in or not, I wanted to be taken seriously. Newbie as newbie does
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:53:31
That’s ambitious I think on my behalf :)
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:54:23
I do like this way of investing and spreading the bet so to speak. Very interested in this.
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:41:44
The good life, I’m 100% going to be doing the same within the next 10 years. Thailand or somewhere near.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:58:56
Just googled him, can you elaborate? Thank you
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:56:31
So you make your whole living from BTC alone, impressive if that’s the case. Thank you very much for your advice, very interesting way to invest.
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:43:36
I surely will, thanks for your advice.
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:26:12
Thanks for your input
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:06:30
Oaf, I’m eager to get immersed in it even more now, you think fiat money and centralised banks will become a thing of the past?
@_date: 2019-05-26 10:09:10
A little excitement, the chance to be part of something in its infancy, and a little money would be good.
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:10:59
Bear market?
@_date: 2019-05-26 11:11:34
No short sightedness here, friend. It would be nice, for sure, but not the expectation or goal.
@_date: 2019-05-26 16:59:50
I’ve folded my wife in on this too, she’s getting hooked as I am. I think I’ll buy in increments over 8 weeks adding up to 4 maybe 5 bitcoin then hodl until we’ll after the halving. That sounds like the best bet to me after reading everyone else’s input, your’all a good bunch.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:53:10
FFS I’ve just checked, yes, I should have bought them this morning ��
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:14:13
Yeah, I can. I don’t think it would ever be that much of a loss though, I can’t see bitcoin going to zero.another question, do you think it’ll spike in June as the analysts have predicted?
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:55:19
I’m Uk so it’s sitting around 6.2 for me.
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:22:47
Oh I do, I just like hearing things first hand in conversation.
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:01:02
What’s FOMO? And I don’t know what dollar coast averaging is yet.
@_date: 2019-05-28 17:04:29
Thanks for the info
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:50:13
No rush, I posted a about 10 days ago asking for advice and people gave me tons, I’m chewing through that just now and going to be buying me some bitcoin as a result of that.
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:53:43
Ha, great plan
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:29:57
Sweet Jesus, was everyone beside themselves?
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:47:33
Does liquidity mean getting your money out? What’s KYC/AML
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:45:39
I’m not looking to get rich but would definitely like to get some extra money from it
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:20:58
Someone else linked the above website, I read a bit and got mega interested, any other literature you could send my way?
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:58:55
One last question, what’s Fiat?
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:24:12
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:51:48
What makes you think that?
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:57:21
You’re a gent ��
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:24:49
I’m very grateful for your thoughts,
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:15:19
That doesn’t make any sense to me at all, I can’t play the drums but I know how they should sound.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:54:14
Already picked up on that from this thread. Thanks
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:12:26
What has been the ATH for BTC ?
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:10:03
Ha, what sites are the best to buy from? What sites or apps should I know about? When bitcoin hits 19k and someone bought at 6k that week have they literally made 13k in a matter of days if they sell?
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:00:47
Yeah I’m tumbling down that rabbit hole now “Fiat vs crypto”
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:24:51
Thanks for the advice
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:20:55
I’m ready coach, put me in the game.
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:28:52
I’ll check him out.
@_date: 2019-05-26 10:06:21
Great input, thank you for your time.
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:39:25
Thank you for your time and advice. I’m really looking forward to crunching all this down over the next couple of months.
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:03:23
Very good points to read, from all the other comments this is like a summary.
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:08:06
Lol, no money is getting out in until I can mindfully navigate what the hell im doing in the first place.
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:46:24
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:37:17
Oh the decision is already made, it’s just when.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:51:58
Ha, thanks for the concern and pointers, I’m not easily lead or easily convinced for that matter, if something makes sense to me I’ll give it some time and research it then come to my own conclusions, if someone is flogging me a dead horse I can smell the bad meat pretty quickly.
@_date: 2019-05-26 11:12:07
Thanks for the heads up, I’ll read into that.
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:50:18
That’s really great of you, what’s your views on private miners to invest money with?
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:33:32
Wonder how many companies make up the other 40%?
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:52:35
Thanks for your advice, I’m buying a ledger in the next coming days.
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:32:58
Great advice, thank you
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:23:20
I hear you, looking at the start of May where I started to gear up to invest at £3,800 and seeing what it’s like now i wish I done it sooner. What’s the chances it’ll go anywhere near 4K again?
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:30:12
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:32:00
I guess you’re right.
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:19:36
A thousand thanks, just reading 2 minutes worth of the explain like I’m 5 bit is great reading, I can’t wait to chew through it.
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:25:38
Really good to know. I take everyone gets excited and buys when there’s a bear market?
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:15:24
Thanks for the reply, I’ll read these later, you think whatever is in those links will be covered by the book bitcoin standard by Saifedean?
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:35:24
This makes sense.
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:08:25
Ok, I’ve just bought that from your recommendation, I’m worried that it’ll be hard to understand for someone like me who is completely external to the process of bitcoin and even stock markets in general. Thanks for your 2 cents
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:38:12
Just subbed, thanks for the heads up! God I love the community spirit on Reddit
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:13:54
Awesome of you to reply, I’ve just bought bitcoin standard 2 mins ago from another comment on here, I guess that’s the bible of bitcoin? 
So do you buy bitcoin to buy stuff or hold onto it when the price goes up?
How easy is it to cash out/sell bitcoin ?
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:01:28
I will, thanks
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:57:32
What’s that now?
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:50:27
What an absolute great bunch of people you all are, it’s invaluable to me to have all this first hand knowledge where to start, the people to read up on, the videos to watch. It’s been several hours now and I’m already thinking the path for me will probably be to buy a BTC in a month or so once I’ve hurdled the basics - lotta reading to do before then.
Please keep hitting me up with everything you’ve got, it’s very much appreciated.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:13:33
Yeah, kinda miffed at my procrastination, still, you need newbies like me
