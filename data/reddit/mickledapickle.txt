I'm not sure if you're being serious, but I will try to answer as best I can!
I'd like to start by saying I'm an investor in BTC and I absolutely see value in it as many others here do as well.
My concern is that to view an asset as "guaranteed to appreciate" is a dangerous perspective to take when considering an investment. During the housing boom, both financial professionals and regular people alike saw assets that were "guaranteed to appreciate" or generate significant returns. Bankers through CDO / synthetic CDO's and regular people through the purchase of houses that were, at the time, continuing to grow in price at astronomical rates. We all know the result of those investments. Obviously a crash in BTC wouldn't have nearly the same repercussions but it is something I would keep in mind when it comes to an asset that has grown so quickly in value.
Also to address your second question -- I would ask that you consider the thinking behind it. If nobody is willing to sell BTC, then yes the price will continue to increase, particularly as mainstream attention is drawn to bitcoin and demand increases. However, you need to understand what drives the actual VALUE of a bitcoin. Unlike another investment, there isn't necessarily a tangible "return" such as a companies revenue/profit but instead intangible value such as the blockchain capabilities and potential future use scenarios in which, maybe, BTC is the universal currency and there is an end to fiat currency -- but it's important to note that this isn't guaranteed (debatable), and if it does occur, there may be bumps along the way.
While I don't necessarily believe that BTC is a bubble that is going to pop, I would exercise caution in viewing ANY investment as riskless. Hope I could help!
