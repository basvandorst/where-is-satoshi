Uhh, the going rate for DOGE was around $1.80/1000. You're the king of getting scammed.

More like Scumbag Bitcoiner: Keeps saying BTC should never be considered a speculative investment, goes apeshit when the price explodes.

Keeping BTC on my phone makes me very nervous.

Panicking and selling losing $75k when it drops in 24 hours?
Are you high?

On Mt Gox as it is in Heaven
Give us this day, our daily Coins
And deliver us from fiat
And not into selloffs
For thine is the wallet, the bits, and the Internets, now and forever

$2500/mo for a studio apartment?
Fuck me!

People are deluded and think it's going to hit $10,000 or $100,000 and you'll feel as silly in a year when that happens for not buying in at $1,000 as you would have for not buying in when a btc was $10/ea.
Personally, I don't see how this growth is sustainable and I believe there's going to be a correction soon. Total guess (Not that any other speculation isn't at this point).

You know what he meant, no need to be pedantic about it.

Maybe she bought 1000 of them when they were like $.50... if so $125 for a ticket into space ain't bad at all.

Seems like "For Now" is your operating word, and I'd agree with that.
In the future, once more retailers begin accepting coins, maintaining a wallet as well as buying/selling becomes as easy as using an ATM, and the price stops fluctuating +/- 200% in the span of a week, they might have a shot at legitimacy.
Who wants to back a currency that's not accepted anywhere, has a high barrier to entry that dissuades casual users, and could change in value from the time you leave your house to get to the store to purchase an item with?

Send some to me, I'll withdraw them (For a small fee, of course!)

It's really all just "TO THE MOOOOOOON" and "BITCOIN AT $10K BY NEXT YEAR? SOURCES POINT TO YES!" and "i wanna buy bitcoin but my parents sed no :("
