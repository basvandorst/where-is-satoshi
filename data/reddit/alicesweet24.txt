Hello My name is Alice im 24 year old Transgender currently waiting for Surgery which is the final stage of my 4 years jurney to become a real woman and living my life the way i so need and desperately want it to :)
Yet current NHS situation and funds is not in the best shape, im trying everyday to not cry and be strong while im waiting for any information or date when will be my turn. Its now a year and because of my Condition and state of mind most of time im spending at home with my lovely grandma and grandpa.
I do not have parents only mum, my dad died when i was little and my mum have another partner and i have been rejected by him so i do not see much my mum, so my old people are my best friends and parents and they really look after me and trying to help me but they struggle. Me my self for other hand Im not going out almost at all  just to work where i do part time job and study at home because im just depressed because of the one body part i want to be removed.
I have chance to speed up this terrible waiting time as i been told but privately, and i will have to go Thailand for surgery and it cost around £ 13 000 i have no chance to have that kind of money or save up by my self, but lately my friend come with amazing idea which can change everything she introduce me to bitcoin and told me lots of good about it.
 She help me a lot even to set up bitcoin wallet so i can stay unanimous as im very shy and basically wont move out from house till i not going to fix my body. I have nothing left but just ask people with money or bitcoin to help me. So if you have anything spare please donate a little part of bitcoin as i no need much one bitcoin is my surgery and i can Live my life normally :) Thank you for your time &lt;3
a little bitcoin donation please im desperate..
