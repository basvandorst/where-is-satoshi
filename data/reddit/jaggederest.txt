There's a natural rate of interest, what it is is open to debate. But if Joe wants to borrow 10 btc and Al wants to lend it to him, Joe has to be willing to pay some rate of interest. The idea of value having a net present value of 100% of it's future value breaks a lot of ways we deal with money - why not borrow an infinite amount of money, if it costs nothing? And why loan anything, if it pays no interest?
Unless what you're saying is that there's no way to make that transaction stick, and Joe will just take the money and run...

Oh I absolutely agree about it being less than 3300% - that's ridiculous if that's what he was offering. Perhaps 1% or a bit more, depending.

There's very little true deflation on that graph. It's easier to look at absolute value than rate of change, since that's an incredibly chaotic graph, but basically before 1900 there was no clear trend in money value, only boom/bust cycles. With the advent of the fed, that stabilized somewhat until the great depression. With the advent of WW2, the great depression was reversed, and since then we've largely avoided it through strong economic growth and wage rises. **Deflation is bad.** We have good evidence in the form of Japan, recently, and several other examples through 20th century history including the Great Depression.

In case you were serious.

Oh no doubt about it. As far as myself, I bought and backed out of my transaction and kept my profits in bitcoin - a whole 0.27, but a 27% return in a week isn't bad.

Reading the contract they signed, Mt.Gox is clearly in violation. You can't contract for exclusive access and then turn around and go "Oh, nevermind"
What do you want CoinLab to do? Sit around hoping Mt.Gox will follow through? Breach of contract is a reasonable and classic time to take it to the courts.
I think it's retarded of Mt.Gox to have signed the contract to begin with.

Never bet what you need to eat. Speculation is speculation, regardless of what assets you're speculating on.

You mean "renounce my citizenship", right? IRS doesn't give a fuck where you live.

iframes, are those like apple branded frames? Because I use a lot of frames on my websites, to make them more interactive.

I'm confused - you mean longer than forever? Honey doesn't go bad, does it?

Right, my point is simply that it's not a frivolous lawsuit from what I can see. There's a genuine dispute over a contract that Mt.Gox signed.
Whether they are right or not, lord knows, I'm not a lawyer. But it's not just 'some guy being a scumbag and suing for no reason'.

Well, clearly since it has done that in the past, that is how the future will play out ...

Try smaller quantities - I wanted 10, but I got 1 no problem.
Then the price increased a lot and I sold .7 to pay for my cash input. Successful bilking the system for 0.3 coins.

Oh, I see, so it's an aesthetic thing. Yeah cool stuff :) I remember as a kid we went to see a neighbor who had bees. Honey on waffles is better than maple syrup, in my opinion.

So you're saying that I can't ever measure lumber more precisely than a centimeter? Real data has real statistical value that can have a lot of decimal places.

I knew a guy who sold 10,000 at $80 or so.
I bet he regrets it now.

I'm not sure why moving to another country would save you from anything - if Mt.Gox is willing to hand your keys over then they're the weak link in the chain. Switch to a more secure exchange, if that's what worries you.

You know, people dig gold out of the ground every year. The supply of gold is increasing.
@_date: 2013-03-21 06:26:10
Gold mining annually is somewhere in the 2000 tons range, so the supply increases about 2% annually, since there is considered to be 120k-140k tons 'above ground'. About 40% of that 2000 tons a year goes to investment, so one might imagine that there was 1200 tons a year of demand for gold usage in chemical and jewelry.
It's definitely not a static amount :)
