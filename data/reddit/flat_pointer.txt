Hitler was appointed by the German President at the time, FYI. He was never elected Chancellor. At the time the Nazis had a large number of seats in parliament. Despite that, his first acts were all about silencing and banning parliamentary dissent as the Nazis worked to gain all governmental authority. 
That said, I think arguing against social welfare via government intervention is not at all buttressed by going straight to North Korea, Hitler, Mao, et all. Your debate opponent is probably in favor of a system like what Sweden put together, which is a bit less of a straw man. If difficult to replicate.
