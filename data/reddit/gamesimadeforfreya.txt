That's what I'm thinking. They also claim to be the biggest exchange in terms of EURO volume which would make sense when they refuse to allow you to withdraw in EURO.

They're lovely until they have your money. They were very very nice when I was asking about their verification process a year ago. Now they refuse to respond and refuse to return my money. 
I'd recommend going elsewhere. And if you don't, don't say I didn't warn you! lol.

Yeah then it asks me for ID that I've already shown them.

Being dishonest and misleading in order to obtain a financial reward. Um yes. It does.
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:49:28
I'd avoid them like the plague after the nonsense I've dealt with.

I like trump. So that doesn't really apply to me. Nice try though.

Down voting me doesn't change the fact that he's an alcoholic that has to take ketamine so that he doesn't shit himself. 
Kraken clearly have a really classy customer base here! Wow.
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:24:39
Yup. Try not to shit yourself you stupid alcoholic waste of space.
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:23:39
No they were fucking shills. Same as the handful of positive trust pilot reviews that kraken paid for.
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:46:51
You make it sound as though I didn't mention that in the title. 
It got downvoted by shills. 
Their support refuse to give back my money.
I don't have time to read their spam. We don't all live in our mother's basements. 
You're a dishonest low life.

Not saying I like coinbase either but at least they were straightforward with me. They told me they couldn't accept my ID from the get go.  Kraken said "yeah it's fine" until they had my money and now they're screwing me. 
I needed the money to pay rent on my new place. Had intended to buy back in next week.  Tbh I don't think I want anything to do with cryptocurrency  anymore.  I definitely won't be using kraken ever again anyway. Horrible company.

I wouldn't have thought so but apparently it is. At least with kraken. I'm not the only person either. Check out their trust pilot that I linked there.  
Of course it has something to do with bitcoin. Some people here are going to end up using them and probably not all but some of those people are going to get scammed like I just did.
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:10:18
Well they've been giving me nothing but nonsense. And I'm not the only one. 
Check the trust pilot reviews. Lots of people saying they are a scam.

About a year. I was verified and they were happy with my ID. Now they're giving me nonsense about it and refusing to return my money. I would just avoid the company is all I'm saying.  Not worth the risk. Use an exchange who's reputation isn't as bad as kraken.

And a ketamine addict. 
Great characters here tonight.
