With the mempool, past performance doesn't guarantee future behavior. If you can show that the minimum fee required to get into any block can be predicted based on the previous 1, 6, or 72 blocks, say 75%, 95% and 99% of the time respectively, that would be more reassuring. But I'm pretty sure that someone paying 10 sat/byte right now is taking a huge risk of not having the transaction confirm until the next weekend.

Not sure how this would work. So your numbers are A128, B128 and (A128 xor B128)?
Another way to protect a private key is to split the 256 bits into 3 parts {A: 86, B: 85, C: 85} of approximately equal lengths, and then distribute the strings:
AB, BC, CA.
Any 2 of those 3 will be able to recompose the full key.
EDIT: Or split the 52-character base-58 key into substrings 18, 17, 17 characters long.

The internet was a technology that was obscure and underestimated in its early days. It grew to be a world-changing phenomenon in just a couple of decades. But there are thousands of other innovations that lived and died in obscurity. Using the internet as an example is tricky because of the survivorship bias.
Furthermore, a big reason the internet grew to be so popular was because it dramatically brought down barriers to entry in publishing in many formats. The contrast with bitcoin is cautionary because bitcoin seems to be relying on its market share and network effect rather than innovating to stay a step ahead of potential competitors. This is a very dangerous and uninspiring route to market leadership.

Given that only a million or so people even own a non-zero amount of satoshis, I feel safe in saying that too many users is a very very remote problem to worry about now, while bitcoin is prematurely hitting its potential. Bitcoin definitely needs ilghtning or some such, but it should not preclude urgently needed on-chain scaling that also continues to keep pace with technology.
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:21:03
Let me anticipate some responses you might receive:
1. But segwit is already an increase to 2 MB or more.
2. We need 100% consensus to successfully hard fork.
3. The network will become more centralized if you increase the block size.
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:42:11


Then you get a sort of proof-of-stake system instead of proof-of-work and the system becomes closed to new entrants. The existing miners can then be used for censoring transactions.

It's not either altruism or short term profits. It's long term profits. Especially since mining is a capital intensive business.

We are at the maximum possible transaction rate - blocks are full and have been for months now. That means the revenues (fees paid by users) are also capped. The only way they would grow is if the fee per transaction grows. This kills growth because it makes competition more attractive to users.

That would be a nice problem to have, but we need to gradually scale up to that point as both demand grows and technology improves (i.e. bandwidth, storage, memory and cpu capacity grows and prices fall). This typically takes the form of 2x improvement every 18-24 months.

Your current computer is a lot faster than your last computer from 3-4 years ago. That trend will continue.

@_date: 2017-03-24 19:55:24
I think this post demonstrates the power of magical thinking. Surely you know that transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are public, and that anyone is able to follow the money. I don't recall anyone on the pro-scaling side actually advocating for banning or blacklisting addresses. I do recall Mike Hearn throwing out tagging coins as a "what-if" hypothetical while qualifying it with "it's not clear this is needed.
As far as lifting the 21M coin cap, again, it's magical thinking to believe that some invisible power will always keep more than 50% of miners in line with your individual preferences. Miners are already able to lift the 21M coin cap if they so desire. So it will cause a chain split and a lot of nodes will consider such blocks invalid. But if there is enough market support (i.e. if recipients accept such coins) it will happen whether you like it or not. I don't think it ever will because of near-unanimous opposition to it, but it's not a mathematical certainty. I should say that I've seen some core supporters say they are in favor of a small amount of perpetual inflation, and that's an opinion I can respect even though I firmly disagree with it. It doesn't indicate malice towards Bitcoin or its users.
Now, if there is a fork with a large balance in favor of big blocks (as most BU miners seem to want), then the minority fork will not need any help destroying itself. Miner desertion will ensure its demise toot sweet. But if for whatever reason malicious miners send out false signals and then switch mining power back and forth between the chains to game the market, protecting the users might require neutralizing such miners. Again there is no violence involved, there is no breach of contract, and there is no violation of the protocol in this. But, in any case, it is 99.9999% unlikely to be necessary because miners don't want to lose money.

Consensus rules aren't like the laws of nature. The only thing that enforces them is the fact that (and degree to which) the network of users, miners and businesses agrees with them. The reason I mentioned this is because PP created a spectre of BU developers unilaterally changing the 21M coin limit just like they're trying to change the block size. It won't be nearly as easy, but the difficulty is orthogonal to whether we are in the core or BU era.

I'm not sure about how electrum works, but in principle it is possible to make these servers trustless. For each address that the wallet wants to watch, it can give the server a thousand addresses (e.g. by only providing certain bits, or actually constructing a set of addresses where all but a handful are randomly selected).
You can also talk to a bunch of servers and use a quorum algorithm to minimize malicious answers. The servers can also crosscheck each other and ban misbehaving nodes.
This is subject to sybil attacks since there is no proof of work, but there's also less to gain by attacking a light wallet in this manner.

Just be aware that in case of a fork you could get your forked BU coins to the exchange very very quickly, but it will take a long time to withdraw core coins to your wallet because of the reduced hash rate and the backlog caused by the still-low block size.

No, they all pretty much take the set of transactions, increment the nonce by one starting from 0 onwards, and if the resulting hash meets the difficulty constraint, broadcast the block.
You could insist that they use something like TEE (i.e. also sign the block with a hardware-locked key from intel or AMD) but adding such a requirement would require a hard fork.

So once it can be demonstrated that a hard fork is not a catastrophic event as some people think, we can do more safe hard forks down the road. We could even have regularly scheduled cut overs that keep the network healthy.

Then any improvements could be phased in predictably and unanimously.

The question to ask is, are you directly or indirectly providing a product or service of value to someone else? With financial services, the answer is clearly yes. People you transact with (buy or sell) are doing so voluntarily out of their own self interest and are willing to pay your asking price for it. That is ethical. You are risking your time, knowledge, resources and invested capital, so it's not just "exploiting capital."
Now, if you knew something that the buyer didn't that would make their purchase less valuable than they think (i.e., if you have insider knowledge), then there are ethical questions you must answer.

Keep in mind that congestion might happen naturally and might look like an attack. Or an actual attack might cause congestion without double spends, empty blocks or reorgs. For example, the blocksize-constrained chain will see further capacity decreases due to the reduced hash rate, and the backlog might increase because of users wanting to move coins to/from exchanges regardless of which coin they prefer.
Also, people unaffiliated with miners might attack the minority network by moving their coins around, contributing the backlog and making the minority chain unusable, so as to destroy its value.

There are certain rules of thumb to reduce the risk of highly speculative instruments. One is to choose investments with good fundamentals. Here, bitcoin's core technology is the same as (or even less feature-rich than) competing cryptos.
Another is that revenue solves most problems. Don't ever let the revenue stream stagnate. Here, unfortunately, we're topping out unless something is done.
Third is don't buy the kool-aid. Listen to reasonable fact-based arguments from both sides and then make up your mind. Unfortunately, both sides of the scaling debate (or at least their loudest cheerleaders) seem to be acting irrationally and unlikely to get anything done in the near term.
So enjoy your paper profits, but keep an eye on what will actually make them real for you.

They have to make new capital investment. But so do the miners in favor of the minority chain.

I was responding to your question "why even care if a transaction is spam" as long as miners are being paid. My point is that it is not enough for them to be paid for the spam transactions. It is important for them to mine other users transactions as well. When blocks are full, they cannot do that, and that is a direct threat to their long-term profitability.
Miners don't really care about non-mining full nodes. They are good for the owner, but not necessarily a huge benefit to the network. If the cost is too high for some users, they will turn off their nodes, while other users with more at stake will turn on their nodes.
I am not convinced by the arguments that big miners will force out smaller miners. There are several techniques like xthin blocks, spy mining, fast relay network which equalize the playing field.
As for setting fees higher, miners, if they are so shortsighted, can already do that by mining smaller blocks than the limit and thus constraining the supply.

If any block size increase, any hard fork, any on-chain scaling (including segwit) is contentious, then there will always be significant numbers of nodes that disagree on block validity. The fix is not to require all nodes to be in 100% agreement, but to ensure that having consistent settings is optimal for most users.
I'm not a big fan of EC, but I think nevertheless that being forked off of the majority is enough of a disincentive that nodes will use block size settings prevalent in the majority chain and remain in consensus.

Each miner decides for themselves, but if a majority have signed on to Viabtc's plan, then they all decide together when they are ready to accept big blocks, and ONE miner decides when to pull the trigger.
This will cause an immediate fork as long as there are still miners mining legacy blocks who will reject the large block. That's where continued majority hash rate support for the large blocks chain becomes necessary for it to survive. In this, though, it will not be any different from the way chain reorgs happen now.

There is one paper, a few years old, that suggested that a certain percentage of low-powered nodes will drop out once block size reaches 4 MB. It did not take into account things like xthin blocks, fast relay networks, spy mining, pruning etc. It also did not take into account how many *new* nodes will join the network because of increased adoption.
There are a couple of precedents where increased centralization caused miners to self-regulate (ghash was one, can't think of the other one). It is worth noting that there are more diverse miners and mining pools now than when blocks were only partially full, so it is definitely a counterpoint to the argument that larger blocks mean fewer miners.

I think this is a tautology *if* you define hard fork as an upgrade with 100% agreement right from the time of the rule change.
However, it is entirely possible for a majority of nodes to upgrade to a protocol change even when the minority does not recognize the resulting blocks as valid at the time of the fork. Eventually, the minority fork should die, become insignificant, or do a fork of its own with less than 100% agreement to change PoW.

An HD wallet with bip-39 mnemonic code gives you a seed made up of 12 or more words. You write those down and that becomes your paper wallet, which you can store in a secure place. You should also print out the bitcoin addresses it spits out so that you can send coins to them afterwards. Those are the only two things you need to consider. If you choose to use a passphrase, you will need that to recover the wallet as well.
The nice thing about this paper wallet is that you can import it into other hd wallets like mycelium, trezor and ledger when you need to spend your coins.
You should ideally use that on an offline computer. If you are sure there is no keyboard sniffing malware or other spyware on your computer, it is also ok to load this page into an anonymous firefox window, then switch to offline mode before generating your passphrase.
In all cases, make sure to verify the mnemonic code by running this in a separate session and making sure that the addresses it generates are the same.

If the number of LN transactions per channel open/close transaction remains fixed, then there is no compounding. A 30% increase in on-chain capacity would afford a 30% increase in LN transactions.

In general this is not guaranteed. If you increase both supply and demand, per-unit prices may go up, stay the same, or even go down. If they go down by a larger multiple than the increased demand, then the total revenue can fall. However, that in turn would put downward pressure on supply and cause prices to creep up again, so revenues might fluctuate before stabilizing.

Bitcoin has value because it serves a purpose - it enables permissionless, decentralized, provable, irrevocable, non-counterfeitable transfer of tokens with a limited availability over the internet.
The "can be used to pay taxes" argument is not convincing. It shows why fiat has value, but not why bitcoin doesn't. You can, after all, sell enough bitcoins to pay your taxes without having to hold on to the fiat, thus effectively paying taxes purely out of your bitcoin holdings.
Commodities (and even intangible goods like software, media files and information) have value even though nothing is priced in those. So the "nothing is priced in bitcoin" argument doesn't nullify its value either.
It can be proved that even if no one held bitcoin, but only bought bitcoins necessary to complete a transaction, then bitcoin will still have value determined by the total value of all transactions in flight.

3. Nobody reasonably expects to go from 2M to 100M per day right away. But Bitcoin does need to grow as technological improvements allow.
4. With caching, you can limit redundant transmissions.
5. Long before we get to visa scale, we will need hard forks for utxo commitments, maybe sharding etc to further reduce the footprint of a node.

I advise against it. The best paperwallet, IMHO, is a BIP32 HD wallet with a BIP39 mnemonic code, and with a passphrase providing additional security, plausible deniability etc. You can even provide your own entropy using diceware, cards etc if you don't want to trust the random number generator used by wallets.

They don't need to go to such extreme lengths. A few hundred millions invested in hostile miners would be all it takes. And even that can be mitigated by shorting the market beforehand. A few hundred thousand invested in unscrupulous individuals to physically attack exchanges and prominent users would also cause a crisis.
One day bitcoin will be attacked by hostile governments and banksters. We're not there yet, but we should grow the bitcoin ecosystem quickly to be big enough to resist such attacks when they come.
We need both onchain and off chain scaling, both very very quickly. Like yesterday. Nothing we do on chain will reduce the incentive to improve off chain and vice versa.

A transaction is a cryptographically signed message to update a globally distributed ledger. You can create a transaction with wallet software of your choice, but once it's broadcast, it is represented by the blockchain, which lives on servers running a huge variety of software. As long as the server software speaks the Bitcoin protocol, you cannot control which codebase that software is based on.

Those 5-10 sat/b transactions go into the same pool as the other transactions, and miners get to prioritize. It's not FCFS. If you want to fill up blocks to drive out even just one transaction, you have to pay a higher fee than that one transaction so it is forced to bid even higher. If you want to drive out all transactions, you have to pay fees higher than all of them.

If it's not a troll, it's hopelessly flawed. The author seems to be under the impression that it is node software that restricts miners from changing block parameters (including reward, difficulty and size). In this they are totally mistaken.
What bitcoin lacks right now is a credible mechanism to propagate accepted network parameters to all the miners. In its absence, miners stick with defaults hardcoded in the core software, and progress remains stalled due to the status quo in scaling.

If you ask someone from the "other" sub, they will probably say you are right, and that we should let the market decide. That clearly hasn't gotten anywhere politically, so the best we can do for now is what 2x has managed to do.
In terms of the actual difference it makes, let's say the organic demand is 900 KB/block, so it only takes 100 KB of paying "spam" transactions to fill up the blocks. At $1/kB, that's $100/block or $14.4k/day to attack the blockchain. If you increase the block size to 2 MB, the attacker now needs 1.1 MB of paying spam, which is an increase by a factor of 11 (more than $150k/day).
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:03:35
It can be quantified. If there are 100M transactions per day, and each transaction takes 1 kB, that's 100-200 GB per day per node downstream.

You say "giving them any other powers" as if there's somebody who can do the giving. The thing is, bitcoin is a permissionless, peer-to-peer network, and there's nothing that technically prevents a miner from broadcasting any random junk on the network.
The reason bitcoin works is because miners act out of self interest: both short-term, in terms of wanting return on efforts spent mining the block, and long-term, in terms of making the bitcoins they earn and save more valuable. So, miners need to rely on a mechanism that tells them what the safe values of all these parameters are.
Currently 80% of them rely on parameters hard-coded in the core node software. In its absence, they would need some other credible mechanism that would keep them mining successfully while scaling the network.
This bitcoinExtreme proposal does nothing to address this need, and will therefore have no effect on the status quo.
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:51:19

Sure, just set up a wallet on a secure device (e.g. a smartphone or PC with no suspicious apps). I like electrum.org, but copay and mycelium are good too.
Make sure you write down the wallet seed and keep it in a secure place where you won't forget it. 2-3 copies in different (but safe) places is ideal.
Then write down the first few letters of the receiving address.
Then, DELETE and reinstall the wallet (or install it on another device), and this time restore using the seed you wrote down. The receiving address should match the address you wrote down previously.
Now you can provide the receiving addresses from your wallet to changetip or any other senders.

The way the free market works is, if a non-coercive monopoly provider becomes less efficient (i.e. charges more, delivers less), then another competitor steals their business by providing more value. This is working as intended.
This applies not only to mining equipment vendors, but to the cryptocurrency market as well.

There's precedent for this in other markets. CPU and GPU vendors sometimes ship you low-tier chips with all the high-tier functionality intact, but disabled through a jumper or in firmware. You still only pay for the low tier though (e.g. lower number of cores, or lower grade computations etc.)

Each individual participating in the bitcoin ecosystem has to make decisions like investing more/less, sending or not sending a transaction, how much fees to pay, whether to burn electricity to mine blocks, which mining hardware to buy, which pool to join, what protocol upgrade to vote for etc.
All of these decisions can be informed by short term or long term monetary interests, as well as moral or political considerations. You can even try to convince other participants of your particular point of view, so that more participants agree with factoring in their perception of other participants' ethics.
However, bitcoin by design is indeed a trustless, permissionless and mostly private network. If you wish to be consistent with the way bitcoin was designed and has functioned since its birth, and if you wish to obtain the maximum benefit from it, then it is desirable to welcome the fact that the protocol rules the network with rigid mathematical precision, without regard to other individuals' perceived motivations. Everybody could be lying, except for the cryptographic signatures on each transaction and the proof of work in every block. Those you can trust and verify yourself. Everything else is ambiguous human noise.

You patent it defensively because it certainly has potential. You don't run it because it doesn't live up to that potential in its current form.
Semi manufacturers have thousands of obscure patents that they never use. Computer chips have lots of circuits that never get used (unless enabled with a jumper or from ROM etc). This is not unusual. There are opportunity cost savings in keeping old modules or adding potentially useful modules when you fabricate the chip, so that you don't have to fabricate a new iteration when the feature becomes usable.

The point is, bitcoin has been around for less than a decade, and the block reward doesn't decay to zero for several more decades. Bitcoin is still very much in the experimental phase. The EDA turned out to be problematic but then the miners' incentives stabilized things. FWIW I still think the EDA needs to be improved, but then the Segwit1x chain also periodically faces adverse dynamics like high fees, unpredictable confirmation times, and even fickle miners chasing profits on the other chain. So I'd say we are all still working on figuring things out before they become a problem :-)


The demand determines the price, and the price affects the hash power. Even at low demands, the most efficient miners will have a greater incentive to protect the chain than to attack it. EDIT: to clarify, even in the absence of a block reward, transaction fees, however minimal they are per transaction, would be the only incentive for the miners, regardless of the block size limit. The mere availability of a higher capacity doesn't mean miners will mine transactions at a loss.


The amount of supply should be decided by those who provide the supply. In a permissionless system with fully autonomous actors, everything can be arbitrary, including fees people pay, the transaction sizes they broadcast, and yes, the blocks miners create. The system works as long as the majority of the network accepts and builds on what these autonomous actors broadcast on the network at any point. That is why there's no need for "an amount of supply *we* will decide" whoever "we" is.

You can generate a signed transaction from tails, copy it (using a phone qr code scanner, for example), and then broadcast it from a normal PC. You can also use the "unsafe" (i.e. non-TOR) browser within tails as long as you are only using it for electrum.

1. We have a very long time (many decades) to go before block rewards are gone. This is especially true if the bitcoin market price at least doubles for every halving.
2. Miners will not mine at a loss, which means that they will not mine free transactions (unless in their opinion such transactions provide a value to the network). The fees can be sufficiently low for ordinary use if transaction demand stays high. Note that big blocks are able to support this whereas small blocks are not.
3. An efficient market needs both buyers and sellers to be able to react to prices by increasing demand or supply respectively. A fee market where the demand is severely constrained is central planning, not a free market.

Do you have a spare pc or an old smart phone? If so, you can boot it with a tails live dvd/usb (pc) or factory reset (phone). Then bring up  on it and disconnect it from the internet.
Next, create a new HD wallet by providing your own entropy (deck of cards, coin tosses, even random keyboard input if long enough). Write down the resulting mnemonic, and copy (e.g. screenshot or barcode scan) the resulting addresses (but not public or private keys).
Then reboot the pc or reset the phone again, bring up either the above web page or something like copay/mycelium wallet, disconnect from the internet, and verify that you get back the same ~~ip~~ addresses after restoring from the previously written down mnemonic.
Then reboot/wipe/factory-reset the device for the last time to get rid of any chance of private key theft.
Now you have generated a wallet while completely offline.
You can subsequently generate and sign transactions while offline, copy them using a bar code scanner (or usb key) and broadcast them from another online computer.

That's a misrepresentation. The actual thought is:"We are asking miners to run our version of bitcoin. If miners think this is good for their business, i.e. if they think the bitcoin economy will accept the coin they mint, then they will do so and we will prevail. Otherwise, the fork will fail and things will go on as before."

What do you mean by "resume using it?" Bip38 applies to a single key, so you should ideally only use it once for spending the entire balance of the key. In any case, if you want to spend the coins from your bip38-protected address, you can scan it into Mycelium. If you just want to verify it, head over to bitcoinpaperwallet.com -&gt; validate/decrypt and check that it generates the correct public address which has the coins that you expect. Do this in anonymous mode with the browser (or the entire computer) offline.

What if, for whatever reason, core does a hard fork to a new PoW on Nov 14, thus abandoning SHA256 completely. At the same time, Segwit2x also does a hard fork to an 8MB max block weight. In this scenario, would you still consider the hard fork "theft" or "fraud?"
So why should the definition of theft or fraud by a completely independent entity depend on the timing of core's PoW change (before or after the segwit 2x fork?)
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:36:08
You have the key, and the transaction you received in the past is the lock. When you spend your coins, you are opening the lock with your key (and locking the coins inside the transaction that only the recipient can open with their key).
Anyway, after the fork there are two blockchain with a common history, which means there are two identical transactions, one on each fork a that you can open with your key whenever you decide too spend the coins on one chain or another. The same key (your private key from the paper wallet) will open both locks.
@_date: 2016-10-26 21:37:56
None of this prioritization will make a difference if the rate at which (even low priority) transactions are coming in exceeds the rate at which they can be confirmed. At that point, the backlog grows indefinitely. In practical terms, that translates to bitcoin reaching a premature equilibrium between new users arriving and disappointed users giving up and going elsewhere.
@_date: 2016-10-29 02:05:22
When resources are limited (and I agree that they are), the most efficient solution is to let resource providers and buyers freely negotiate the supply and price.
When a third party interferes with either side of the market (supply in this case), instead of letting miners and users determine supply and demand, we get an inefficient market with severe structural problems.

It's reality, not a promise. The technology is out there and its open-source. There are already dozens of implementations vying to replace bitcoin. The biggest advantage bitcoin has is its immense first-mover advantage made even bigger by the quadratic nature of the network effect.
However, we should not take this advantage for granted. Instead, we should be striving to stay one step *ahead* of the increasing userbase and provide scaling proactively. Restricting supply while increasing fees is what established sclerotic monopolies do, not disruptive innovators.

You have a worldwide permissionless network that is getting more and more popular every day. All it requires is an internet connection and some free, or even open source software. And it can do about 250k transactions *per day*.
Now, the present backlog could indeed be because of someone's intentional action meant only to fill up blocks, but is it really that hard to imagine 250k transactions per day being conducted by the entire bitcoin user base, for legitimate purposes (i.e. wanting to send money peer-to-peer, as opposed to wanting to foul up the network)?

It's very well defined. Segwit is 1 MB non-witness data plus up to 3 MB witness data.
A 2 MB blocksize (without segwit) increase is 2 MB regardless of  witness or not.
2 MB + segwit means raw block size is still 2 MB, but witness data can be separated from transactions and is allowed beyond that 2 MB, up to some other limit.

8 MB blocks can be relayed on a 100 Mb/s connection in less than a second. 
There are already multiple fast relay networks that are open to individual miners.
Improvements like xthin/compact blocks can reduce the propagation time even more.
Even if miners are consolidated in data centers for cost/efficiency/reliability reasons, that does not automatically mean that control of those miners is also consolidated.
There are hundreds of thousands of data centers in the world.

It wont' be forever, for all nodes. There are solutions possible where miners can put in utxo commitments (e.g. a hash of all UTXOs from genesis up to latest) in each block, and then nodes can trust that while only keeping live UTXOs instead of the entire blockchain in their local map. This is still trustless because you can verify the hashes by downloading old blocks if necessary. The only drawback is that you cannot instantaneously fetch the history of every single dead output from local storage, but then a common complaint is that this is exactly what most nodes do not want to store.
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:10:48

3. The first block with non-witness size greater than 1 MB must include at least one segwit transaction

This is purely opinion and conjecture. There is no evidence of miner centralization with large blocks. Blocks are now consistently larger than a couple of years ago, and there are more miners and more mining pools, not fewer. There's this idea that a big miner can mine large blocks and then mine successor blocks before a smaller miner can catch up, but that comes with its own orphaning risk.
Indeed there is precedent for market pressure against centralization when on two separate occasions a pool got close to 50% and miners left those pools in droves to the point where those pools aren't even around today. IIRC ghash.io was one of the pools.

I'm not sure if you're actually interested in discussing ideas or just calling names. In any case, since there might be other readers interested in the issue, the point is that the "fee market" that core developers refer to is an inefficient one where the supply is constrained (through the block size limit in the predominantly used core software), so as transaction fees and backlogs rise, miners are unable to respond by increasing supply (i.e. transaction capacity). So it's not a proper free market, and a better fee market would be one where those restrictions on supply would be relaxed as technology allows.
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:06:06
Absolutely. Fortunately, there are immediate benefits to an increased blocksize - namely, faster confirmations, elimination of the backlog (at least until demand grows again over a few months), much lower fees, and a dramatically better new user experience. So it's not just a hard fork for the sake of a hard fork.
You don't even need to convert current coins to segwit addresses to enjoy more throughput.
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:44:13
I would be fine with that. I would be fine also with the hard fork including malleability fixes to non-segwit transactions. But maybe once a hard fork is shown to be safe, and even the 2 MB raw block size becomes insufficient in a couple of months, a follow-up hard fork can take care of that.

I think the details are being worked out. I'm pretty sure, however, that all signatories will agree to running code that enforces the above, or they risk their blocks being ignored/orphaned by a large fraction of the network. You can always back out of the HF if none of the preceding blocks actually have size &gt; 2 MB. The "lock-in" isn't real unless it's on the blockchain. It should be noted that even after the HF it is possible to impose a soft limit of 1 MB or less, but it would have to be done by consensus.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:14:22
Never. The pro-segwit belief system requires blocks to be full and fees to be high in order to push transactions off-chain.
If per-transaction fees are low, transaction stay on the blockchain, but then the blockchain (which cannot increase supply in response to increasing demand or prices) fills up and fees increase, which means fees cannot remain low.

There's not much point in arguing with the full node fetishists - they arbitrarily define consensus as whatever the majority of nodes enforce. They ignore the facts:

  3. that 99% of users don't run full nodes,
  4. that economic nodes are those run by exchanges and

So, RBF and zero-conf double spends are mostly independent of each other. Here's how I understand it:
If sender does not use RBF (i.e. set a transaction sequence number less than MAX): Nothing changes. The existence of RBF in the protocol is pretty much a non-sequitur. If sender sends a double spend transaction shortly after, the recipient's wallet can detect and flag this. If sender waits too long, nodes and miners will discard the second transaction.
If sender uses RBF: The recipient has the ability (and indeed the imperative) to wait for at least one confirmation. The recipient has a dramatically higher chance of sending a successful overriding transaction.

The relationship between market price and miner earnings is somewhat complicated. Especially because the above completely disregards difficulty increases since the time of $300 bitcoins. As prices increase, more miners jump in the fray, causing difficulty to increase, hence capital costs go up, and even at higher prices, the return on investment is relatively constant. The RoI can be somewhat higher when prices are volatile (which they always are), but I'm guessing the most efficient miners probably only clear ~5-10% on their capital investment and operating expenses.
The reason it is in the miners' interest to push for more on-chain scaling is not so they can make more money (they could even make less if competition gets too strong), but it is rather to ensure the long-term survival of their business model, which is mining bitcoin while bitcoin is in demand.

For an ordinary coin to become a segwit coin (and take advantage of its size discount), the receiving wallet needs to provide a segwit address first. Even then, multisig transactions get a disproportionate benefit compared to ordinary transactions (simply because they contain more witness data). IF you are about to receive $1000 from your friend/customer, how long would it be before you trust a segwit-compatible wallet?
Transactions that send coins to a non-segwit address get no scaling benefit from segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:42:32
Well then this agreement is good news because you get both at the same time for the price of one!
Edit: more seriously, that position is exactly what seems like hard-fork avoidance to pro-scaling people. We have already seen on-chain scaling from previous soft limits of 250k and 750k up to 1 MB. We've seen how smoothly bitcoin worked with spare capacity and how horribly it chokes with full blocks. It is segwit that needs to be assessed carefully, not on-chain spare capacity.

It doesn't have to be this scary. Hard forks should be well planned yes, but not necessarily rare and avoidable. If you advertise them enough, almost all economic nodes (exchanges, miners and large businesses etc.) will be on board on day 1. Those that aren't will just reject all blocks and quickly figure out that they need to upgrade. If the API doesn't change, then none of the software layers on top the node need to be changed either.

If there's an element of speculation in the valuation, it's quite likely that it's orthogonal (or at least additive) to the utility of bitcoin. So if the utility increases but speculation stays the same, the expected market price will still go up.
It's not just an assumption that current limitations are turning users away. Fees have increased to the point where a lot of UTXOs have turned to dust, and blocks are constantly full, which means that users not willing or able to pay the minimum fee will never see their transactions go through.

BIP148 (and the immense imaginary miner army it commands from its underground bunkers) threatens to orphan blocks that do not signal segwit, thus resulting in a split.
BitcoinABC (and the medium-size, very real miner army its proponent Jihan commands) threatens to start mining a large-blocks segwit-free fork as well as to squish any upstart BIP148 fork **if** it persists and gathers mass. This will cause a second fork, resulting in 3 chains.
In the middle of all this, segwit2x (which commands a promised 85% miner army) should activate segwit through miner signaling and set in motion a hard fork about 3 months subsequent to that.
And core, which doesn't really have an army of its own, is not really on board with any of these proposed forks.
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:42:03
So tell me this. The day of the hard fork arrives, and antpool mines a 2 MB block. You're some other miner. You now have to choose - orphan ant's big block, and risk ending up with a minority chain with 1 small block per hour, an instant 6x longer backlog growing even longer by the minute as users rush to the exits, a risk of wipeout and rapidly waning utility, or choose to mine the chain that 86% miners have declared they intent to mine one.
Even better, ant mines a 2 MB block and along side it, it mines 6 empty small blocks in a row on the old chain.
What do you do?

It's worth noting that the segwit soft fork and the nversion-less hard fork "lie" about different things: segwit lies to unupgraded nodes about the contents of transactions, while the omission of nversion causes lite clients to accept block headers from the post-fork chain, but doesn't cause them to accept previously invalid transactions or transactions whose format they don't recognize.
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:32:17
Yes, those guys are a joke. They don't get that a hard fork to which even one person is opposed is dangerous because it is *ipso facto* contentious.
In their eagerness to increase the block size, they ignore the fact that some full nodes which only have a limited amount of memory, disk, or bandwidth will be priced out of the market. Instead, they indulge these fantasies that Moore's Law (whose death has been proclaimed by experts for several years now) will somehow sustain the network by magically making computers more capable.
These guys are so hung up on so called notions of making bitcoin transactions cheaper and more plentiful, that they don't realize that high fees and full blocks actually make the network safer. If you don't get this, I can't explain it to you. I just don't get why they think they want to attract more users to bitcoin when the network is already struggling to support the few users we do have.
The really crazy thing that they believe is that we should just ignore the expert developers who have worked laboriously on core for all these years, and instead allow random anonymous network participants anywhere and everywhere - not supervised or guided by core wisdom - to decide what to do with the network. That proves that they don't care about decentralization. I mean, I can't even!

It's also quite possible that your transaction is large because it's merging a bunch of unspent outputs. A misconception that a lot of people have is that the sending address contains bitcoins and that's that. But in fact, it contains distinct unspent outputs from different incoming transactions, and each distinct output has to be signed if it's included in the transaction. Wallets will also merge coins from different addresses if a single address does not have enough to cover the transaction.

Non-mining nodes have no relevance to hard or soft forks. Miners also run full nodes, so they can support the entire network by themselves. Without any blocks, full nodes can't do squat.

For a very contrived definition of "working."

The question is whether there are more buyers or sellers *at the current price*
There are bids and asks, with the bid price lower than the ask price. When there's "more buyers" it means more bids are met by market sell orders than asks that are met by market buy orders.
Another way to look at it is whether a trade raises the market price  ("more buyers) or lowers it ("more sellers").

@_date: 2017-05-18 21:44:51
Yes, and this has been raised numerous times before. When blocks are full and there's a permanent backlog, there's no upper limit to a fee that guarantees confirmation.
Let's say the current median fee is $1 and there's already a backlog. So the fee estimation algorithm comes up with something like $1.50. Then all new transactions use this estimate, and the result is that nothing changes except the fees paid, and the backlog still remains.

But what your node says stays with your node. No other node hears you say that. In particular, exchanges and business (through BitPay) do not care about your node's opinion about my big block. There is no mechanism in place in bitcoin for that information to be even relayed by a full node.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:31:42
It might become less of a problem in the short term, but because segwit is a one-time increase, once the backlog and the fees decrease, the demand will increase until blocks fill up and fees climb again. Then segwit is out of tricks. Even LN will not help at that point unless fees stay high, because otherwise people will just use on-chain. And if fees are high, it will curtail adoption because most casual users will not want to pay $10-$50 to lock up their funds in a LN channel.

Here's an idea that would make this more acceptable: the first segwit block must also contain 1.99 MB of non-witness data, and the first block with &gt;1MB non-witness data must also be a segwit block?

A hard fork is inevitable. If ~100% of miners go along with it, a chain split is impossible. According to latest [coin.dance]( stats at the time of writing, 99.3% of the blocks mined within the last 24 hours were declaring support for Segwit2x (NYA).

8 MB downstream every 10 minutes is 8000/600 = 13.33 KB/sec average. Over 1 second it's 64 Mb/sec.
Individual nodes shouldn't have to relay blocks when there are thousands of miners, but if you wanted to, that would add one second per connection per block at 64 Mb/sec.
The node counts decreased over the years when light/mobile wallets became popular. No one is claiming that you would run a full node on your phone, even at today's puny block sizes.
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:29:33
Both replay and wipeout protection are under discussion, though not part of the first alpha release (see  and the subsequent discussion). If 95% of miners get on board, it won't be relevant anyway.
Poison blocks are more likely to be orphaned, so in general it's not as huge a concern as believed. In any case, the max transaction size remains the same in segwit2x.
As for "everyone must upgrade," that is not true for 99%+ of bitcoin users, including merchants who go through bitpay.

We have precedent. On 2 prior occasions, demand has bumped into the soft limited max block size (250 kB and 750 kB IIRC), fees and backlogs began to rise, and both fell once the soft limit was raised.
@_date: 2017-06-20 20:29:05
There's nothing "forcing" anyone to do anything, but perhaps "impelling" would be a right word. Once the 2x part activates, suddenly the "rest of the community" finds itself waiting for an hour between each successive block, the backlog grows like crazy, then exchanges stop listing the coin because it cannot perform, then miners desert, and the block interval gets even longer and so on. If you don't switch to the majority chain, your node experiences infinite time dilation and its network contracts to zero. If you don't upgrade, your node is as good as dead.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:58:51
Yes, of course. This is well known and should have been undertaken at least 2 years ago so we could have been in the position to evaluate it right now. But instead all we got was stonewalling from core. So now someone else is doing it instead of core. That's they way it goes.

For 99% of the users to go along, he just needs exchanges and the nodes behind those 99+% light wallets to switch. Those who rely on full nodes  to track their coins (less than 1% of all wallets) will have to keep themselves informed or risk losing track of their coins.

If it's known, it's not public knowledge. I thought the general understanding is that there was no single instance of theft, but that instead coins were moved out over time, in fact possibly several months before the bankruptcy, and the deficit was made worse by inept forgery through fake trades.

The spouse already knows about bitcoin, so it's easy for their lawyer to question you under oath about your holdings. Even if they didn't know about bitcoin specifically, they will go through bank accounts and last couple years of cash spendings with a fine-toothed comb, and you would either perjure yourself, or come clean with all the details of the coins you hold. If you only admit to some of the coins, the lawyers can simply hire a blockchain forensics expert to try to find any coins you might be hiding, or any assets you might have acquired with coins you spent recently.

Keep in mind though (full disclosure, I"m a big blocker), that one of the purposes of the 2 MB hard fork is to demonstrate the safety of hard forks in general, so that future enhancements to the protocol (including future block size increases) will be less contentious. That is why it is an acceptable compromise to big blockers who think the ideal block size should be a lot bigger than 2 MB, and in general should be left up to miners. We don't think this will adversely impact decentralization, unlike the small blockers.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:14:24
Miners are people too. They have as much right as any other user to choose what to mine. When you use the word attack to mean "mine a fork of their choice (or even both forks) with transactions of their choice," it completely misses the point of bitcoin being a trustless, permissionless system where each individual is free to act according to their own best self interest as they understand it.
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:33:40
Less than 1 % of bitcoin owners run full nodes at this time. The cost of running a full node is actually cheaper than the cost of sending a bitcoin transaction, so there's no incentive to run a full node unless blocks are large enough to get rid of the backlog and the outrageous transaction fees. Segwit is not enough to achieve this goal.
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:11:17

A lock and slow-release mechanism outside the protocol? For example, 3 lawyers in 3 different countries (not including her country of residence) who are authorized to release one three-of-three multisig key each per year to the heirs?

You need to make the 1 MB take less physical room. That's what semiconductor process generations (as well as telecom signaling standards like docsys) achieve. In other words, what fraction of an average disk drive is 1 MB? What fraction of an average broadband connection is 1 MB / 600 seconds?

There are a couple of things missing from that. One is the capital cost of miners. They depreciate very fast because of increasing difficulty and rapidly improving hardware. So a new antminer might take a few months to break even and then a few months after that to become unprofitable.
But the biggest cost is all the miners that DON'T find the block. After all, it only takes the one correct nonce to solve the block, which is probably O(1 nanowatt) in power burnt. But behind that one correct nonce are many trillions of attempted nonces that do not yield a valid hash. That is what takes up almost all of the 20000 "wasted" watt hours.
Economically, the $3.68 is not "earned" by the miner. It is the price you paid to secure your transaction. Your bitcoin is backed not by the full faith and credit of an authority, but by the mathematically provable expenditure of compute power which makes it impossible to nullify or falsify your transaction. That is where the $3.68 (and the 20 kwH of energy) went.

Jihan was one of the earliest miners to agree to run Segwit (as long as it was followed by a hard fork to increase the base block size), and his stance has not changed AFAICT.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:52:31
The first line of the [charter]( states that the parallel upgrades are segwit and a 2mb hard fork. The reason for the 2x is to clarify that whatever capacity the current segwit allows, this will allow 2x of that - so 2 MB MAX_BLOCKSIZE and 8 MB max block weight. This should preempt both the "but SegWit *is* 2 MB" objection as well as the ploy to limit the max block weight as some from core have proposed.
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:51:53
That's not fully accurate either. Some miners support segwit but no HF, others support HF but not segwit, they agreed to mine blocks with both segwit and &gt;1 MB raw blocksize, and their combined hash rate amounts to ~83%, as opposed to less than 50% for either proposal by itself.

Overly secure would be 3-5 backups, with at least a couple of them off-site (stored in encrypted form in the cloud, entrusted to a family memory or friend that does not live in the same household, or in a safety deposit box at a bank).

It's simple really. Bitcoin is open-source. It's a well defined protocol. Anyone can write a client with any changes to existing code, and if you persuade enough people to use it and enough miners to mine it, then it takes hold. In this case, there's 80% hash power and industry players like bitpay who have thousands of users behind the proposal, so it will take over.

I think you two are in violent agreement. "Only part of their size is counted" is equivalent to "it's a reduction in transaction size." If blocks were actually bigger regardless of transactions, you'd get a hard fork. If the transaction size going into the total is not reduced, you would still be limited to a 1 MB wire size.

If core changes PoW, the new chain will be far less secure without all the hash power securing it.
Even if it survives that, the same players with the cheap electricity and cheap data centers will be best equipped to mine with the new PoW, so you'll be back to square one, only with a proven hard fork behind you, so the resistance to hard forks for scaling will have lost its wind.
