I'm afraid that doesn't make any sense to me. If I have a transaction 12 hours ago with high priority that hasn't been confirmed a single time yet, what do I specifically have to do? I use Blockchain for my transactions.

After using it for a good two years or so, this is the first time it's happened. One flaw that didn't do that much in the end is not a good enough reason to me. But thank you for your input.

I use Blockchain.info because it's the first one i tried using. I use it a few times a week to make business transactions, and so far it's done the job for me, without fail. I honestly don't see reason to switch at this point.
Thank you for your input, though.

Now that's a good reason. I'll definitely take a look at it.

Ah. Thank you! My transactions just got confirmed all at the same time, so it's all good.

Still don't get it. Thank you for your time.

They are international, and the only viable option for me at this moment.

Can you explain to me what you mean by "Pay the fee"? I'm primarily using Blockchain for an easier way of payment, never delving much into the finer details.

I don't remember, no. It's only very recently that I begun dealing with BTC in any form.

No idea what Trezor is, but I'll have a look.

What do those two offer that are superior to Blockchain.info ?
I have only ever used blockchain as my BTC wallet, so I don't have anything to compare with.
