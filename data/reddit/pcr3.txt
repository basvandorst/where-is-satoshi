Heres where I see this working :  
This could possibly replace MediaFire, Depositfiles, Uploading, Appdown, etc... 
Replacement/ supplement to mirror sites; its kind of a "faster" lane if you are willing to pay. If all the slots are full, this will allow you to get a slot immediately.  
I work with Android ROMs pretty frequently, 10% of the time the file expires and is hard to find. Honestly, I personally would use this service to avoid Mediafire and other download sites to get fast speeds.

While, you may have been right... I would hold off on any "I told you so"'s.
Imagine if they were to buy in, then panic sell... you'd be "accountable".

Good to know! I have yet to send to another Coinbase user yet.

I will need to check into this... Although it worries me to lose my BTC to another company.

Disclaimer: I have nothing to do with cryptsy besides LTC/ BTC trading.  
I spent a lot of time on the  IRC channel waiting for my own balance to be fixed. It was super annoying when people (like you op) would log in and just start bitching right away. You likely didn't even submit a support ticket like they requested.  
  
They are getting slammed with requests for balances to be fixed and have just recently (yesterday) added an audit button to the balances page which will usually fix "missing" balances.  
  
Take OPs experience with a grain of salt. My experience (besides the lag) has be excellent and I will continue trading on that market.

First, I would buy from Amazon, its cheaper and doesn't support EVIL ebay. 
  
It will take you about 6-12 months to make your money back (the 11$). Don't buy it unless you are doing it for shits and giggles.
Its kind of too late to get into the mining game. Unless you have an edge (like a PCB manufacturing company).

Personally I feel that there is just too much risk. I don't think anyone is willing to take on that task of possibly losing your money. Although I'd love to see this happen... A company that diversifies in Alt-coins like LTC.

To your last question /\  
Basically you spend time trying to earn those BTC, if you calculated it... its like making $1-3 an hour.

I understand this is a EUR company, but does anyone know if you can have an account/ make deposits from US bank?

These Task based earning sites are usually full of spyware and generally not worth it.  
 If you do decide to dabble with this, I would HIGHLY recommend you download VirtualBox and run these "offers" in a cloned machine, because you WILL get spyware.
