Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors (LFTR) 
LFTR is an alternative nuclear reactor which could provide limitless energy and reach a threshold to eliminate poverty and provide a blueprint to the next level of civilization. This would be the advent of robotics, space exploration, Mag-Lev trains, ubiquitous automation, en mass vertical farming hydroponics, end of toxic oil/coal spills, elimination of energy resource based conflicts (oil), and by extension render the petro-dollar useless thus ending the 40 year reign of the fiat monetary system. This could result in a limited growth economy based on sustainability. 
LFTR has all the advantages of nuclear energy but almost none of the disadvantages. Basically LFTR could save the world while crashing the ponzi-scheme fiat system thus giving BTC a chance. 
my 2 btc.

Interface is solid. Its a good looking app (iOS) worthy of trying. Mind you its still in Beta at the moment. Sending bitcoin via IM is really useful and neat concept.

1 BTC = 233 USD and trezor is $120 USD. That is about half a BTC right now.

The price reflects its security and ease of use. No need for a paper wallet or 3rd party website like circle or coinbase. I suppose for some people it isn't worth it.

I recommend buying a Trezor. Its a small device to store your bitcoin securely with jumping through hoops.

My Circle app was showing $200 worth of bitcoin then it disappeared. ???
