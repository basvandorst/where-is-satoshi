I lost everything in the financial crash of '08. And sure, that was a horrible feeling, but at the end of the day, it's just money. The only thing, which truly matters in life is life and the people around you like friends and family. So after some time you get over it and restart ... . 
Having said that, I understand this is hard. Loosing someone close is always very painful. :( Sorry for your loss.

An even simpler guide.
1. Put in hardware wallet
2. Put hardware wallet in rocket
3. Launch rocket into space

Why even consider being a customer at Bank of America, when you have lots of much better alternatives.

They're not all idiots right?
BTW ... any token issued before there is a clear utility is by its design a security. If it barks like a dog, it walks like a dog, ... it's probably not a cat.
Then why is the majority of the industry trying to tell us, that the dog in front of us, which is barking by the way, is in fact a cat.

I can name quite a things I am not happy with:). Trump, the weather (every now and then), ... . If you are unhappy with Bitcoin you can obviously go back to fiat or gold.

Seriously? A headline "Blockchain to be used to decrease poverty, give access to education, medical services for the needy ... ." would have been better.

But the experts and sophisticated bankers who brought us the 2007/8 financial crash are smart and sophisticated?

Accepting prediction advice from someone can't spell ... sure.

Not really a solution. It's like going back to paper money.
