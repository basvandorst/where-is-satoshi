I step away for a few hours and all the sudden changetip is going bonkers... what's happening?

Do people pitch and form teams at the hackathon or should you only come with an idea + team in tow?

If you move to the Bay area, myself and some other cryptocurrency startup founders are creating a free, intensive course for software engineers. It's all about building for the blockchain and writing decentralized applications (we'll be putting up the recordings online, but the focus for the first run of the course is in-person).
Provisional start date is December.
Sorry for the uninspiring wordpress site (still under development and I never said we were designers!):

Because the default is that interest and principal is reinvested into new loans, rather than sent directly to coinholders.
We anticipate that most people will simply sell LC on an exchange or P2P to cash out rather than destroying it. But we think it's important to give people a way to take claim on the underlying assets if they want to (if you can't take claim on the underlying, how do you know it's really there?).
For example, let's say you own 1% of all LC. If you decide to burn it, we take a snapshot of how valuable your stake is. As borrower's repay interest and principal, you receive 1% of those payments until your stake is paid out.

Rename 'Unknown' and 'Other Unknown' to 'Possibly GHash.io' and it doesn't look much better.

If people bid up the price of LC too far above the value of the underlying loans they are being dumb.
We're more interested in trying to create a credit framework for the blockchain.

Cool, will take a look.

Well, it's possible to pump it on a secondary exchange. But it would be very obvious what was happening - there's no 100x scenario that would justify that kind of speculating.

The default is that interest revenue is reinvested into new loans. Typically, coinholders will sell their coin on the secondary market or, if they wish, they can destroy it in exchange for direct BTC payments.


When lenders deposit new outside capital into the lending pool they receive LC.


There's not a cap. There's a cap on the number of loans the network can reasonably/safely make, so that will likely cap demand/issuance of LC in practice.


No. LC is only created when new capital is deposited into the pool. And that money goes to make loans, not to us.


Almost, except LC is simply a claim on the pool, so it's not really accurate to say you get interest *plus* LC. Our revenue model is to charge an origination fee on new loans (which is clawed back if a particular loan defaults, so we only make money on good loans).


No, the BTC goes into the capital pool for making loans. It's still yours.

Burning is currently the only way to change out into the underlying. If we come up with or hear about a better alternative we'll certainly consider it.
You can of course, sell LC to someone else to cash out, but that's a bit that doesn't effect the underlying.
There's no hard supply cap. But there's only so many loans the network can reasonably/profitably make. So, in practice, there is likely some equilibrium between demand for LC and supply of loans that will act as a soft cap.

Tim Swanson's books are both very thorough and more or less up to date.

To add to michwill's answer, ~2/3 of the loans currently outstanding are denominated in BTC and ~1/3 are denominated in BTC. So the price of LC still moves with BTC, but not to quite the same extreme.
As we add loan officers to the network, this mix can and will change. These loan officers will be making loans in many different currencies, so LC will be more of a basket of currencies and won't be overly exposed to any one currency.
The default is for interest and principal to be reinvested into more loans. But if you want to "cash out" of LC, you can burn your LC by sending it to a provably unspendable address. You'll then start to receive your share of interest and principal repayment directly in BTC until you're fully paid out.

LC isn't equity in our company. LC holders receive the interest revenue on loans, but they don't participate in origination fees (our company's revenue).
LoanCoin is a Counterparty asset, so it uses the Bitcoin blockchain. If it's successful and if coinholders want us to, we may migrate it to a sidechain or Ethereum in the future.
