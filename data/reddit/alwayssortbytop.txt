Cheeky. I like it.
Upvoted for historical accuracy.

Wait, you're saying that miners don't validate blocks?
I'm pretty sure that miners check every single block before working on it. This checking can be considered validating. It's the same thing. Regular nodes check, but don't build on top of.
By "nodes left with a smaller percentage of hashpower"
What I meant was nodes validating work from miners with a smaller percentage of hashpower.

I'm always interested in objective facts and that happens to always make me right.

The question is, do they coordinate facial expressions?
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:19:04
It doesn't scale for normal users because opening, closing and disputing a transaction all require on-chain (expensive) transactions. 
The LN is only imagined for small amounts because nobody wants to lock up large amounts of coins. 
LN would be perfect for exchanges that do high-volume back and forth transactions. They wouldn't be good for general users due to high fees unless those users keep them open for years and years.

The miners are part of the community. Users and businesses have been asking for an increase for two years. They've been ignored.

People forget that modest size changes are not dangerous to the network. The marginal decrease in node count will be offset over time by new user adoption (1% of new users choosing to run a full node).

Uh, you could say the same or even more about core, who have been uncompromising. 
The developers of the reference protocol are to be held responsible. They have not listened to the majority of users and businesses. They divided the community and supported the silencing of opposing ideas. Their hands are not clean.

**BitcoinCore also has a bug today.**
It was send discreetly instead of in the open, which was a childish move by core developer Peter Todd.

I'm not gonna argue with you, but I think you're completely and absolutely wrong. Lets agree to disagree.
@_date: 2017-03-15 23:01:07
Core is super centralized... 
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:26:10
They have one guy who decides what goes in and out of their software. He wants "consensus" but really it's maybe 5-10 people who can say yes or no to a change that gets forced onto the network.
Segwit is a perfect example. It has completely capped out at 25% miner support and instead of changing it to what miners are asking for, they are planning a user-activated soft fork and other extremely dangerous, even criminal, DDOS strategies.
Segwit will never get 95% activation, and instead of stalling the network, the 10 people that run core should compromise with what the community wants.

Be sure to sort this by "Top".

Miners don't start work on a larger than 1mb block.. they check it first. They don't just blindly accept anything that is given to them. I'm not sure what you're referring to but I believe we're talking about two different things.
@_date: 2017-03-12 17:04:08
Where did you get the 99%? Developers merely contributing doesn't mean they "love" a proposal, just because they're part of the group.
I'm interested to see a source.

To be fair, I don't think anyone knew or could imagine how bad things could go over at MtGox.

Any miner with 51% of hashpower can potentially fudge the network. I'm pretty sure that's the big security issue people are concerned about when it comes to "security". 
Nodes decentralize, which is another type of security.
So I don't disagree, I just think the POW that miners contribute has historically been seen as securing the network.

A UASF would be a hostile attack against Bitcoin. I don't know why this posts are allowed here no matter what side you're on.
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:37:52
Good, it was reported the right way, and it wasn't shouted on r/bitcoin "Look everyone, Bitcoin Core has a bug!!", unlike what Peter Todd just did. It's pathetic and your defense of him, Segwit, support of core is pathetic too. I've read all of your shit posts.
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:02:03
That's not true, they only listen to about 8-10 of them... and they kicked out Gavin Andresen because he (and others) disagreed.
You can't kick out the people you disagree with and then call it consensus. Further, on the BIP from Gavin for 2mb blocks, it had over 85% support from developer ACKs on Github.
@_date: 2017-03-09 01:50:02
I agree that just having 51% isn't easy to mess up the network, it's a theoretical attack vector.


Miners also validate blocks, and there will still be plenty of nodes to validate on whatever side has 51%. I agree with you if miners are alone with 51% and nobody else validates their work, but that would never be the case.
Meanwhile, nodes left with a smaller percentage of hashpower won't see new blocks at the same rate as the larger POW. Eventually that hashpower would decrease as it switched to the larger chain as happened with the ETH split.


It takes work to find/create the blocks. I think we're talking about the same thing.

It won't work:

No, it didn't. It happened right after it.

lol bitcoincore.org... 
right 
@_date: 2017-03-09 01:33:59
Bitcoin is working right now, and only a small single-digit percentage of users run a full node.
You will never ever get 85% of the network to run a full node unless they are doing it unwillingly.
Also, I disagree because at some point you will have enough nodes spanning the globe to be secure enough. I don't know what that number is - maybe 10,000 - 100,000 with mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:09:20
They're not safe because the network relies on POW for security.
