Nice good find ��
@_date: 2019-07-22 05:24:33
True, hence why I’ll take it
@_date: 2019-07-11 14:00:44
I agree, a lot of this shit has had a chance to develop and launch a product. There’s not much out there we can point to and say, “Yeah, this project will change or improve this industry”.
It’s basically all payment solutions which Libra will take over once it goes live so the altcoin reckoning will occur in 2020.
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:28:45
Exactly...these Dex’s need to hurry and level up.
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:07:24
Definitely too volatile for currency exchange, it’s definitely more like a digital version of Gold.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:49:35
Putting your money on platforms like Bitconnect or Novachain. 
Leaving funds on smaller exchanges that get “hacked”. 
Putting money in shitcoins with no utility and it dies slowly. 
Not practising proper security measures to keep your private keys safe.
FOMO’ing into pumps
Losing your private keys (I suggest a hardware wallet)

1. Bitcoin works whether it’s $0.001 or $17,405.55. The network didn’t break, it was only congested.
2. As a miner, you contribute to the security of the network by staking electricity and computational power. In return you receive a mining reward and fee for successfully mining a block. At present, no government or single entity has yet to hack the Bitcoin network. This means it’s censorship resistant, every year your government taxes you for money you earn, taxes you for money you spent and if they so please they print more money further inflating the supply of fiat and devaluing the purchasing power of your dollar.
3. While this is true, the Bitcoin consensus (Proof of Work) adjusts the difficulty of mining blocks so it averages a mined block every 10 minutes. This is by design and it adjusts every 2016 blocks. There’s plenty of mathematical computations behind the science of [Bitcoin mining difficulty]( So while computers have improved architecture, gotten cheaper and more efficient, the Bitcoin consensus will only release new Bitcoin every 10 minutes so miners can’t cheat and create new Bitcoin out of thin air. This isn’t the case with fiat, the central bank can print more money and control and flow of capital in the economy.
4. No one knows who Satoshi is and for the security of both Bitcoin and that individual, it should remain that way.
I hear your point to have an improved version of what Bitcoin is. But consider this, Bitcoin is a digital version of gold. We stopped backing fiat to gold so we can practise fractional reserve banking. We starting using digital money to have funds transferred quicker and then credit cards came into play to further exchange capital. Now we have Paypal, stripe and other payment solutions to further hasten the exchange of capital. All those things I mentioned after gold are considered higher layer solutions to gold exchange (or exchange of value). 
The same can be applied to Bitcoin and the crypto space. I’m sure there will be a scaling solution on top of Bitcoin such as Lightening so it’s more feasible for commerce. Still a work in progress so there will be further development.
I hope that offered you insight and we can discuss in a **civil** manner even if we disagree.

@_date: 2019-07-12 21:19:11
You make a good point. I think that’s where the government will want exchanges to collect KYC and will draft legislation to **try** to regulate the on/off-boarding of funds.
I see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation but I’m not naive to what it may mean for certain bad actors and evil people who will take advantage.

You must be living under a rock. Thanks to Mark and his attempt at a cryptocurrency. He’s forced the US governments hand to look into Cryptocurrency, namely Bitcoin since it poses the biggest threat. 
I wouldn’t be surprised if cryptocurrencies become a topic in future presidential elections if adoption grows.

True... I get the novelty aspect with some of the OG crypto’s. If it doesn’t scale and the user experience doesn’t approve for the lay man, it’s not going to work out if a new comer swoops in to take market share. 
I’ll give Lybra a chance and see how this all plays out.

Once you know the why of 2017. You’ll know what Bitcoin needs to have it pump again.
@_date: 2019-03-25 13:15:08
What I would advise is to watch Andreas Antonopolis’ videos. He explains the who, what, when, where and how of Bitcoin and crypto very well for a beginner and expert to learn new things.
Honestly, you don’t need to know everything in this space. Just a basic concept of why Bitcoin has perceived value, the power of using a blockchain, the importance of scaling a blockchain for adoption and most important, securing your crypto!

I’d imagine sideways, probably down and then a slight pump. I feel it will have adoption in the developing world before the 1st since the banks own processing.

BTC all the way!

That’s like walking into Facebook and asking for a stock to get your portfolio started.

If you own precious metals, stocks and real estate and you’d expect those to hold value and possibly garner some gains. 
As for Bitcoin, the expectation is to also hold value. It’s a newer asset so it’s more volatile, but yes, there’s an expectation to see it also rise in value too. In the future, once there’s more adoption I’ll use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:14:24

Well my only answer to this is the underlying tech may not be ready to have millions use it every second. We saw how slow and expensive it got at the peak. Hopefully in a few months maybe years we’ll see Bitcoin gain traction.
@_date: 2019-06-15 14:06:30

It’s possible but the majority of people won’t use crypto unless the problems and the over security improves.

The second I read Bitcoin investing service I knew the money was gone. 
Bitcoin was created for the individual to hold their own funds to transfer between peers without a middleman.
It was not created for central bodies to take investment funding.

Yeah it’s tough for on-boarding these days. Most banks may block off purchases so you’ll have to find one that allows it. Kinda of a headache and probably a reason why new money can’t flow in like last year. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 06:50:52
I can see people buying due to the potential hype of the ETF getting passed. Then we may get a correction if it’s not so good news.

The attitude in this thread is why no one rates crypto. We need to be inclusive to all who are curious about Bitcoin. 
To the author, please do a little research into what Bitcoin is, when’s a good time to buy (hint: never during a serious pump), where it can be used and stored, why you wish to buy some, how it works.
After answering those questions you’ll have a better idea of how Bitcoin brings value. Hopefully you’ll learn how to calculate a profit or a potential loss.
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:10:21
Well you basically gained 10 free Bitcoin. That person lost it unfortunately for them.
