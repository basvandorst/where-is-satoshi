WOW. So, just out of curiosity, in layman's terms how do those two transactions show which keys were used?

700 bits for the LOL. :-)

I'd agree. I got the white thread because I was planning on doing decorative stitching based on the TARDIS doors, then scrapped it once I realized that it was a little bit outside of my skill set at the moment.

Okay that's cool. I'd not seen the turbines before. From the sound of it you wouldn't necessarily need to be able to withstand the high winds of interstate-speed driving, just recharge when you're parked for the night. This would be problematic in areas with little to no wind, though, so turbines that work while driving wouldn't be a bad idea.

THAT is super helpful information. I meticulously double-check my work and, while I haven't had a stitch out of place yet, it's good to know that it can still function with a couple of errors.

Thanks! I'm sure he'll appreciate it.

Try it for yourself! :)
(Also, yes, it does scan, even on a computer screen usually.)

Thanks! I thought it was fitting. :-)

Oh yeah, they're brothers, if that's your question. 
In my opinion, that's secondary to the fact that Mike Toomim is heavily invested in the success of one side of a very public, very polarized debate, while also being allowed to pretty directly determine how the vote is measured by designing the election software. Even taking his brother out of the equation, that's an unacceptable conflict of interest.

Jonathan Toomim is a lead developer on Bitcoin Classic (top of list above Gavin Andresen on their site). Mike Toomim is behind consider.it and its backend framework, and is also directly involved with Bitcoin Classic.
So, what's happening here is that the Bitcoin Foundation is advocating for community "unity" and "consensus" on the block size/hardfork debate. In order to gauge the community's opinion, they intend to use a closed, proprietary voting system developed by Mike Toomim, who, because of his direct involvement with Bitcoin Classic, has a strongly vested interest in it taking off and supplanting Bitcoin Core.

Accusing bitcoin of money laundering is like accusing The Internet of hacking you.

It blows my mind that his credibility somehow survived that, and fries my brain that people somehow STILL take him seriously.
