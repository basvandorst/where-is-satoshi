Yes, I have tried two other computers running different versions of Windows.

Great find.  Interesting information.  I didn't have any issues transferring my XRP to the ledger one of the few times I've successfully accessed the wallet since Ripple was installed.  Though, I'd say whatever patch/solution was implemented as a result of the node network access may have impacted the Windows compatibility.

As of now, that's what I'm hoping for

Thanks for the input.  Great point.

So far my customer service experience hasn't been the best.  I'm not going to bash the company given not many crypto-related companies could have prepared for the massive increase in business this year.  Just frustrating that there aren't other options for communicating my issue like a phone number or live chat.  I'm usually very patient, but this market is unpredictable and the last thing I expect to be a hindrance is the hardware wallet.  I will definitely update the post once I resolve the issue.

Do you have the Ripple wallet on your Ledger? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:04:23
Very true.  Forgot about that option. Thanks for the reminder.  Would still be nice to have a working Ledger, though.  Ha! 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:19:56
I agree.  I doubt Windows security vulnerabilities matter much given the additional security features of the ledger, but I guess you can never be too safe.

Good suggestion, but it didn't work.  : /
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:25:21
OK.  I'm thinking my issues might have something to do with the installation of the Ripple wallet on my ledger.  It was working fine before.  Only problem is I can't access the wallet manager to remove the Ripple wallet, ha!

Yes, I have also tried another USB cable.  Thanks for the response.

I just checked and my ledger firmware is current (1.3.1).  Glad you got yours fixed!

Not true actually. I’ve never sold any crypto for fiat and have no plans to do so. It’s my opinion that converting back to fiat would be counterproductive. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:37:48
Gotcha. Thanks for the explanation. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:39:33
I tried that per instructions in the message I received about my flagged post. Tried on iPhone and PC and kept ending up in this revolving door of login screens and recent history. No clue why. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:37:22
What are you even talking about? I didn’t post a price, price prediction or anything close. The majority of posts in this sub revolve around price speculation. My post was far from that, even. So.....nah man

People can’t predict what bitcoin will do thirty minutes from now and this dude is taking about 7 years from now. Someone slap him with some reality
