More like YOLO.

This is the crucial problem. Nobody should have a say, BTC should just... Exist. I wish there were a simple solution like simply computing more blocks per second (instead of bigger ones) to accommodate more transactions. Or making a 1998 Dell PC as powerfully as a Chinese mining plant. Maybe one day!
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:54:13
Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:10:50
This is a great point. True decentralization might be an utopia, after all. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:23:29
Not really, with more blocks you can speed up things. Bigger blocks mean that you can carry more things. 
To carry more is different than carrying faster.

I only have a mobile wallet (Jaxx) and my seed safely written on paper (and memorized). I used to store in blockchain.info but transferred everything to this brand new Jaxx wallet - so I think I'm safe. In any case, I though that by keeping the status quo they want to keep BTC un centralized? 
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:49:04
Absolutely, if you ask my opinion I'd say it's far more likely everything goes to shit. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:55:19
What do you think to be the most interesting/revolutionary aspect?
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:31:31
Don't understand your explanation, everyone's money can't possibly double without a catastrophe as a consequence. Mind rephrasing your point?
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:17:38
To a certain extent, yes.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:28:56
When I set up my BTC wallet on Blockchain, they gave me a 12 word password. Are those words my bitcoins private keys? I also have a super long code of letters and numbers that I have saved on google chrome which is some sort of "username" that I use to see the funds I have in my wallet, is this "username" also my wallet ID (aka code that people use to send me bitcoins)? Presumably my bitcoins are stored on Blockchain's cloud/servers or something, is this secure at all? How can I store my bitcoins in actual pieces of papers? Or let's say, a text on notepad secured on an offline machine? Should I even bother doing that? If I store my bitcoins as text on a notepad, and want to retrieve it at a later date, how can I do that? Is there any fees? 
It's all kinda confusing, I know, but maybe you'll understand my questions and help clarify them. The concepts are kinda unclear to me.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:13:29
That would be dope. I guess the stone wheel must be invented first, so then we can have Pirelli tires. At least BTC is a start. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:14:09
What graph platform is that?
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:47:02
Yeah, I suggested that too. Hopefully he can at least track it down.
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:34:27
Also, if I consider 2,000% then all I'd need to do is 12x my investment, by purchasing 20 BTC right now (instead of ~3 BTC).
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:00:46
This clearly can't happen, it would be a disaster!
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:41:19
Is my Blockchain wallet ID my actual private key?
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:29:21
Sorry for the novice questions, but the majority of people is favoring the split?
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:48:16
Well if anyone needs a reason not to buy 20 BTC (or 3.2 BTC for that matter), there it is. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:51:09
You made great points, do you mind elaborating a bit more on this?


@_date: 2017-05-26 18:34:30
Is the private key simply the combination of 12 words I received when I created my wallet? I was using Blockchain until last night and managed to "open" my wallet on Jaxx (I was told Jaxx is safer) for iOS, anything else I should do? How can I delete my wallet from Blockchain and have it on Jaxx only?
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:47:15
Ideally it would upgrade itself upon increase of demand. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:23:27
Does private keys' letters/numbers change once they land in the recipients wallet?
EDIT: I don't think so, but the public key does. Maybe I'm wrong?
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:22:00
If I had the answer to this question I'd write a paper about it, sign as *Satsohi Nakamoto* and upload it to this sub. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:26:10
I'm also a redditor for three months.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:34:11
Let's say I found a private key. How can I move the bitcoins that are tied to it to my wallet? I don't see anywhere on Blockchain (the website that presumably stores my BTC) a box in which I can type the private key in order to redeem the bitcoins. My understanding is very limited, I'm new to the scene.
@_date: 2017-05-30 00:24:58
I'll simply sell my coins because from my understanding the whole thing will be gone to shit. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:18:37
That's not my only plan, it's just a hypothetical scenario that I came up with by looking at the numbers. I'm with you on this one, I don't think we'll be alive to see the downfall of money.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:14:56
I have a Magic: The Gathering card that subtlety suggests the price of a bitcoin will reach precisely US$1.2 million in exactly 30 years. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 00:51:17
To be honest with you, yes, but consider quitting altogether by mid July (if not earlier).
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:10:57
I have an iPhone, what should I do?
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:11:08
I'm with you, it's utopic.
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:48:08
I just made a post similar to yours. You put in better words than I did, BTC is going to be dead this decade still. If we just had more blockchains, instead of bigger ones or split chains...!
@_date: 2017-05-30 00:36:53
I also have no fucking clue about what's going on but from my understanding the safest possible bet would be to completely swap my BTC balance for Ethereum instead. Since I use Jaxx, this will be easy as pie. 
EDIT: Apparently, swapping for Litecoin sounds like a better idea. I just hope I can swap back again to whatever BTC version turns out to be more popular. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 02:25:27
I believe both coins will instantly and considerably drop in value, therefore I'm preparing for it. You can't simply double currencies in two different markets and expect them to hold value, *let alone increase in value*. It's basic economics, won't happen. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 01:30:50
I'd love to tell you why, but the problem is that I don't even know myself. Look for BIP148/UASF. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:54:00
Thank you for the in-depth response. After I've done these steps, my keys will be stored on my iPhone, inside the Jaxx app, instead of an unsafe exchange/cloud server? Would that be a mobile wallet?

Safely written down


Upon opening Jaxx on iOS, I entered my 12 word code and it "restored" my BTC (never used Jaxx before, by "restoring" I'm presuming that it "downloaded" my funds via the actual cloud/blockchain network to the Jaxx app/my iPhone). Does it mean my funds are now safely transferred to a mobile cold wallet, instead of Blockchain.info?
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:17:35
I couldn't really understand the UASF, my knowledge is still very limited. Are they increasing the size of the blocks so more transactions can go through at once?
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:12:12
Thanks, I also read the Satoshi white paper and helped me understand it a bit more. Turns out bitcoins don't actually exist, they are just a "right" that you can forward to another party.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:31:03
I meant, simply put, as the perfect world your mentioned. We are humans, self interest and greed will prevail until the end of times. Even a fully automated BTC protocol, self sustainable and self scalable would presumably still require maintenance. Whoever has the janitor keys is in control. That's the problem - a completely decentralized system can't possibly exist with the mining technology and scaling structure we currently have. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:06:26
I think that too, for me the most incredible aspect of it is the ease to essentially transport very large amounts of money from one country to another. Also electronic devices integration, it's like money paper simply doesn't need to exist anymore. Paper wallets are also incredible, the whole Blockchain and keys concept is very nice. The human brain isn't wired to understand it completely, I don't know how could anyone even conceive this. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:46:46
Close to 15 BTC, basically $30k USD stored in exchange webwallet... You were asking for trouble. Do you have any proof of your balance? Can't you simply check your wallet ID and see where the funds were moved to?
@_date: 2017-05-30 00:48:37
Once the outcome of this debate becomes clear (resolved), I will swap back my balance to whatever BTC iteration turns out to be more valuable/popular. This is ridiculously easy to do via Jaxx (my mobile wallet) and I recommend noobs like me to consider doing the same. Another altcoin to consider is Ehthereum (not Ethereum Classic).
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:24:55
I don't see the point of a hardware wallet, you can simply lose it, break it and it's too expensive. How easy it is to lose an object the size of a USB stick? I'll never buy one. Will keep using my mobile wallet, its secured by a long pin, my fingerprints hence it's inaccessible for everyone but me. In case somebody steals my phone, I can simply retrieve my wallet via seed (I memorized it and have it on a hidden paper). Come to think about it, essentially I have a paper wallet, which happens to be backed up on my phone. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:12:15
Well, I can see how my reply must have read connfusely to you, but I didn't mean that $2700 is a dip. What I meant is that I believe we reached a peak and right now we are going downhill - I don't know where it will stop though. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:42:04
I know, a hardware wallet is costly though and I already have my phone anyways.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:49:27
You voiced exactly my thoughts. I also have all these concerns and to be honest, unless you have several hundreds of thousands of dollars worth in BTC or any crypto currency if you will, a hardware wallet is completely unnecessary. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:58:04


Very valid point, however my assets do not justify a proper hardware wallet. I'm sorta with you on this one though. But still, my mobile wallet is practically unhackable.


I don't think my iCloud security steps, my fingerprints and Apple password isn't exactly "minimal". Realistically, the iPhone is practically unhackable. It's impossible for someone to obtain control over my phone, given that I simply browse the web and use verified/secure/established apps. It's nearly impossible for someone to restore my phone settings/data on another iPhone, unless he has the password and I'm sure no one can obtain it. The only device I ever entered my passwords on is the iPhone, so no keylogger ever registered my passwords. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:59:32
You speak the truth.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:58:49
I'm totally with you.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:18:35
This FBI story is great, $1.3mil seems like a great deal to whoever successfully hacked the phone. I wonder how they did it! 
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:26:10
So you believe BTC will keep rising as infinitum since last night? Of course not, we are in a frenzy and a peak is being established this week. There will be a correction (dip) and then the price will go up again like it does everytime. It's the cycle.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:32:45
Dip is taking place right now, -3% in the last hour. Expect $2800 possibly $2700 (maybe less) today still.
