How does the LN make sure it gets to the right wallet and that no one in the chain takes funds that are supposed to pass through their channel?

If that was apart of the contract then yes, I'll would be illegal for them to not give it back.

Smart contracts allow you to write programs that automate money transfers. A smart contract could, say, set up automated deposits to an address and allow the seller to choose an interest to charge the person buying the house.

If someone refuses to move out of a house that they're not paying for, that's what happens in the current system.

But by holding onto fiat currency you're missing out on gains so you might as well use Bitcoin and live frugally (which everyone should be doing anyways).

I believe all the things you said are value in exchange. By value in use it means use besides a transfer of value.

Yeah and it's caused by low interest rates and over extension of credit. I'm pretty certain there's going to be another crash coming soon that's worse than 2008 and it's going to be the Feds fault.

Don't waste your time trying to teach someone who doesn't want to learn. 
People just don't care. They have other things they'd rather think about. Like my roommate said, "I'll care about it when it affects me." And that's how 90% of the people out there are.
Or it could just be your explanations. I remember watching a few videos about bitcoin years ago and to me it sounded like miners were solving secret algorithms that gave access to another Bitcoin. Once someone explained to me that miners are simply verifying transactions and they have to agree with each other for a transaction to be verified, it clicked. It no longer sounded like mysterious puzzle solving game with rewards. 
There's also people who just aren't interested in finance. You start talking about central banks and inflation and governments and it just doesn't interest some people.

So you're saying lending will be a way of improving friendship or something? If it's not for profit I don't see why anyone would give someone large chunks of money without getting something in return. 
Credit exists because people can make money off of it. Borrowing is vital to the economy as long as it increases productivity. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:31:53
Wages will have to lower as Bitcoin value increases, else labor will become too expensive. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:22:13
You could be right about that. I guess that would be better for the economy because people wouldn't be buying things they can't afford. The 2008 crash never would have happened if people just didn't buy houses they couldn't afford. The idea that inflation is necessary because it incentivizes people to buy is ridiculous. Most people do not care if things get cheaper in the future. They will buy it as soon as they want it. People who care about that are already saving their money in investments. We need a saving economy so people can start businesses and so people don't go bankrupt. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:51:15
Market cap for all currencies go up when the economy booms. If the fed didn't print money, USD would be deflationary today. 
Bitcoin won't need to be tagged to anything. Competition will cause prices to go down as everything gets cheaper. USD isn't tagged to anything today, businesses are just forced to raise prices as everything becomes more expensive. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:57:21
Who would give someone 50 Bitcoin and expect 45 back in a few years? The lender would be better off holding onto the bitcoin themselves. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:55:49
From the other comments, I've decided that people just won't buy things they can't afford and loans will be used for investments that increase productivity. People will rent cars and houses until they have saved enough money to buy one. If this economic model existed before 2008, the housing crisis never would have happened. Borrowing money for things that do not increase economic output is bad for the economy. It is not sustainable.

So your purchasing power will stay the same but your mortgage will keep getting bigger and bigger, relative to your wage.

You're looking at the depth chart right?
The orange is resistance from going up, the green is resistance from going down. Less orange resistance doesn't mean it's going to go up, it just means when it does go up is going to go up faster. It's the market orders that make it go up or down.

A lender would be better off holding onto their Bitcoin instead of lending it to someone else if that was the case. So no one would want to lend anyone a house. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:13:17
But not your mortgage

How else are you supposed to buy a house? Unless you're really rich, you need to get a loan. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:45:44
House worth 50 Bitcoin, not down payment of 50 Bitcoin. 
Why would the lender want to refinance? You signed a contract saying you'll pay 55 Bitcoin in the future. The lender will love it if bitcoin's price went up 10% in a year cause youll still have to pay that off. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:38:09
Stably increasing at 5% a year you mean? Population increase and increase in supply will continue to deflate the currency no matter how stable it is. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:00:42
Fiat will end itself. The US will soon reach a point where it can not pay it's debts and inflation will be the only option. During times of mass inflation, people have historically moved their savings into gold. But now we have cryptos which are a better alternative. In ten years from now, I predict the USD will be worth next to nothing. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:54:36
Paying 55 Bitcoin will become very difficult as it's value increases.

I expect  all fiat currency to crash in the next 5-10 years because of national debt levels. So adjusting to USD will not work.

They should just crowd fund a lot of things. The government should ask for funding for different things and if they don't reach their goal then everyone gets their money back and it doesn't get funded. Nothing would ever get funded! ��

Inflation does not cause people to spend more and deflation will not cause people to spend less. If you were correct then no one would buy an iPhone when it comes out cause they know it will be cheaper in a year. People who care about saving money are already putting their money into investments. If bitcoin or another crypto reaches mass adoption to where the average person uses it in every day purchases, then the crypto will be very stable. 


No, when cryptos have taken over fiat money, the deflation rate will line up with increased economic output. So when economic output increases by 3%, the total crypto market cap will increase by 3%.  People will only have to expect their investments to have a greater return than that plus interest. Businesses expect their investments to create much greater reruns than that. 


This is necessary for Bitcoin to reach a higher market cap in its early stages. Without those people hodling their bitcoin now, it's never going to reach the multi trillion dollar market cap that it needs to be a world currency.

I know the video says to buy stocks, but it very simply explains why inflation is ahead of us. This is why we should buy Bitcoin.
