having been stupidly scammed for bitcoins before, i'd propose that you wait until ethereum or some consensus based contract system is in place so you can write terms around how you release your bitcoin to this person or group or, heck, it could even been an evil toaster (welcome to internet of things!).

lol, i almost bought a bfl device once. the broken checkout page and customer support email two weeks later were big hints that i should look elsewhere for my fancy hashing circuits.

Huh, I thought onename.io was storing this info on the namecoin blockchain which is more oriented toward this kind of thing (basically a huge, public name/value store).

After doing the dogetipbot thing for a while and taking a break, I am still not sure how to feel about tip culture :\ I suppose those that like it will do more and those that are confused or dislike it will do less.
...goes back to minting and lurking.

If you want to also get Devcoins in return for merge mining with Bitcoin. Developer also built this p2pool tip app if you want to support decentralized mining without buying big iron:

So, graphics card mining? Aren't these systems more useful at scrypt mining than sha-256? Where the antminers at newegg?

&lt;3 that replicant project. i utterly destroyed two cheap android phones while playing around with it :)
FOSS and FOSHardware are they way to go.

You may be right, and I still hold with the best of the 'em. But lately I haven't been able to justify leaving other communities in the lurch just because I want to turn an even higher (potentially, we'll see :)) profit on the mainstreaming of Bitcoin.
Also, diversification makes me feel less anxious anyway ;) And you meet some good folks out there in the smaller communities too.

I would not think about alt-coin adoption as being side-tracked. If Bitcoin has taught me anything it is that competition and diversity is our friend and not our enemy. I believe in Bitcoin. I also believe in the power of open source software and the potential of the human spirit/creativity that Devcoin adopts explicitly as part of its culture.
Crypto-currencies do not derive their power entirely from the innovation of the distributed network and public ledger. They derive much of their value from the people that hold them and the ideas they embody during their lifetimes.
So, again, I ask for help from one community to another. There is enough room for us all.

I didn't use their website to create my Namecoin "u/" entry, but onename.io does pick it up and display it. It's a pretty nice thing to point people to or use for yourself when you're moving around from computer to computer.

"isnt very successful". idk, i've seen worse. they have some devs working in the github rep these days with cool sounding names on the pull requests. as long as people are finding a use for it and taking care of the code i think it must be some amount of successful.

Really liked the last laptop I bought from there a couple years back and am excited about this higher resolution model: 
Also, Trisquel ( runs real nice on them ;)
