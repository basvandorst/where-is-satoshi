He is President of the US, beating both the Bush and Clinton family.
You on the other hand, are definitely humanity's finest.

So, he still won manipulating people, just like any presidential candidate does.
How are your smarter than him? How is the average Democrat voter smarter than him?
Like him or not, like his tactics or not, Trump is smart, and used it to win the US election against literally everything.
Again, what have you done, that makes you capable of calling him a dumb person? Please enlighten us with even remotely similar achievements.
Btw, you honestly believe the impeachment/resignation narrative? And believing that, you dare talk about other people being manipulated. Pls
