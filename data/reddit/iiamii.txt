So if guess it's time to invest in the pesos because Bitcoins seems overvalued ��

To be honest, it's a really basic, poorly written, and just template edited video about it. But I guess the masses watch it :/

Hey, thanks for this podcast, it is actually really enjoyable to watch it, nice sound, good questions.  
Yes I do understand this problem that the crypto space is filled with the idea of "hey, I like this, lets make blockchain about it" even with being just a shitcoin in the end with decent of hype and no real value around it. I would not plan the approach of a decentralized blockchain at any other project, because architecture by itself is a clearly centralized "product".  
However, in the project (it is a competition) they are specifically writing that "the future is decentralized", so in the concept that if everyone would have a temporary residence, you would need some kind of system that helps with the management and ownership questions of it.
In the video, he is only talking about real estate as how it is right now, which would be a wrong approach of decentralization. If you would rethink living as a whole and make people live wherever they want, do you still think that approach would be plain wrong?
Thanks for the answer so far.
Oh and a more off topic question; I am not 100% in the architecture industry yet, though I've repeatedly experience a strong ignorance against blockchain from architects or achitecture students, do you experience like that aswell?

actually no; I did it with the program rhino and grasshopper, aswell as a few other plugins such as Vray here is the video how I made it: [
