In established money networks, it's not uncommon to find cycles: I work for a shipping company; shipping company pays me, I pay coffee shop, coffee shop pays shipping company to obtain more beans.
LN is partially designed to make use of these cycles - when I buy a coffee, I might not *need* to open a channel directly with them. Instead, I can use the existing channel I have with my shipping company (in which most of the money is on my side of the channel) and the existing channel my shipping company has with the coffee shop (in which most of the balance is on the shipping company's side). If I sent a payment *through* my shipping company to the coffee shop, it "recenters" both of those channels, making it easier for payments to go in either direction in the future.
This could be reframed to show a scenario where the coffee shop pays *through* you, though. Let's say its channel with the bean supplier is "saturated", i.e. all of the shared funds are with the bean supplier with the coffee shop having exhausted its balance. On the other hand, its got lots of open channels with its customers. It's to the coffee shop's best interest to *not* let these channels saturate, because that means the channels have to be closed and a new one opened, and that requires both parties to pay blockchain fees. So, the coffee shop splits its payment to the bean supplier into bunches of tiny payments and routes each one through whichever of its customers are online. The coffee shop avoiding blockchain fees associated with opening a new channel with its bean supplier, and also saved fees from closing its channels with its customers since those customers can reuse the channels longer.
I have no idea how LN will play out in practice in this regard. But hopefully this provides at least one believable reason that channels that *appear* to at first be unidirectional might actually be used bidirectionally.
