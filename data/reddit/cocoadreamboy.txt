btw I'm sure you would love to get my algo. I don't think you would understand it, but you would love to get it lol

read my website man, you might actually like it if you do: 
That is the analysis, I have price floor and algos for BTC, BCH, ETH. With historical data to back it up. I've been working on this for a year. I worked on that post for 10 min lol

The price of bitcoin is driven by demand, but the cost of mining is driven by demand for mining equipment. It costs less, naturally to mine a bitcoin than it costs to buy one. The people that have invested in mining equipment, staff, electricity, land, lawyers, etc have a vested interest to keep the price of bitcoin above their creation costs. Just like a gold mining operation would buy any gold that they could get for less than the cost to mine. Bitcoin miners will scoop any cheap bitcoin up for less than the cost to mine.

One more thing, not only did the hash rate change rapidly, but the mining EFFICIENCY changed rapidly. Once I inputted the new efficiency upgrade the price floor shrank down to where the price shrank to in late December.

It costs money to manufacture anything. The difficulty alters the bitcoin return which alters the cost of making one. The prices people are willing to sell to me are the market prices i.e. retail prices. Wholesale prices (which are the things I monitor) are the prices whales acquire bitcoin. Which is the price whales are willing to dump the price to. They won't go lower. 
Whales aren't stupid, they are very intelligent people. I'm just showing you what they pay for their produce vs what you pay at hyper inflated (right now) produce section of your local exchange.

He described bitcoin miners as widget makers. And then said widgets aren't worth anything. I addressed his comment how I believed he intended earlier, this was just asking for clarification. 
What do you think of a fundamental price floor for bitcoin mokahless? 
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:11:19
You really think bitcoin is some kinda fad?
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:32:10
That is provably not true. The bitcoin network has almost $2.5 billion of infrastructural investment (servers and mining farms) active right now as well as almost $3.5 million/day in electricity expenses. That is a lot of sunk cost. The bitcoin network uses more electricity than the country of Finland. That cash flow has effective amounts of value and momentum. Cash flow analysis as well as asset values are the main methods of valuing anything, including bitcoin ;)

what do you mean?
@_date: 2019-05-22 21:36:50
Correct Bitcoin price is SUPPORTED by mining costs not driven by them. The miners have sunk cost and need the price of bitcoin to stay above the floor price. De Beers has a vested desire to keep diamond prices above a certain amount. During valentines day diamond prices naturally increase, but on Halloween De Beers doesn't let diamond prices drop to nothing.

In november 2018 had you sold Nov 8 and bought December 22 you would of had double the bitcoin. that means now you would have 15,400. Now is the same situation. My metrics are to help my clients more efficiently get larger pieces of the bitcoin pie. 
It just makes sense if you want more bitcoin as well as less stress. 
A better statement you should make is I lost out on doubling my investment because I didn't understand when the market was super inflated (i.e. now and in nov 2018).
@_date: 2019-05-23 00:38:11
This is not speculation. This is the only usable metric for understanding what you are buying when you buy a bitcoin. You seem to enjoy being a troll. I hope you enjoy your bitcoin losses just as much :)
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:45:44
Oh my god thank you!!! You're a rose among thorns ;)
@_date: 2019-05-23 03:14:57
Timing the market allows you to multiply your time in the market :) You gotta get that resonance yo!
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:45:35
so you are arguing that the sunk costs in an asset depreciates immediately upon purchase. So the only value in a car is the gas you put in it?
@_date: 2019-05-22 21:16:17
The algorithm finds the infrastructure cost and the electricity cost from the hash rate. This metric can change on an hourly basis. The daily floor price can vacillate up to 20% on some days. In the past 3 days it has gone as low as $3800 to $4900. I monitor what the whales are doing so that people will be able to measure the risk of their investment. I made this to help people protect their money from the whales.

Bitcoin has inherent value as an inflation hedge, wealth storage vehicle, wealth transfer unit, wealth hiding investment vehicle. It is different than say beanie babies. Had the people in Venezuela bought btc with their money instead of holding onto their country's currency they would of been protected from the inflation by their central bank.
Because it costs so much to make a bitcoin if the price is close to the price floor it means that in the short term your investment is protected by the massive whale investment in the bitcoin network. I am not saying bitcoin will forever be of value. I am saying that there is a fundamental price floor metric that is effective at identifying levels of speculation in the bitcoin market.
@_date: 2019-05-22 21:44:23
I am hoping to make logical metrics available for people in crypto. No one else can explain logically why the bitcoin price doesn't go to zero. I can. Right now the market is in extreme speculation. To buy now is foolish, to sell now is intelligent and logical. These metrics would of helped me save money in Nov 2018, and they will help people save money at the end of may too ;)
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:48:54
Miners aren't stupid man, Yeah if you are mining on your CPU it costs 12k/bitcoin, but no one is doing that. These people have invested millions/billions in bitcoin. 
If they have failed they fail over a long term basis, not today. If the price floor is broken heavily THEN sell because the bitcoin mining infrastructure is breaking down. That is how you know a coin fails, when the price floor drops out ;)
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:14:41
Only a moron FOMOer is buying right now. I only buy when I can get bitcoin at a 10%-15% markup over what the miners get it at. I am a smart educated investor, with effective metrics ;)

Work to create something is valuable for a time. The floor can't be zero if the bitcoin hash rate is above zero. I'm not saying the hash rate can't go down to zero, but at the current momentum you are looking at a \~$4300 price floor. If you invest now you are looking at a possible 47% drop. In contrast if you bought on May 2 you were looking at a 15% drop ($5390btc to $4575 price floor). I do not believe in hodl, but I do believe in understanding the market and making profit.
@_date: 2019-05-22 21:03:49
You could also give the analogy that the supply has been preordered by miners, in their infrastructural and operating costs. They have bought the new supply at a price already. The demand for bitcoin has already be bought up to the price floor.
@_date: 2019-05-22 21:07:28
It is not the price of mining equipment that has increased 16x, but the difficulty of mining has increased significantly over the past 3 years. The btc hash rate has gone from 1.39exe to \~50 exe now. That is almost a 50x increase. The only reason the price hasn't gone up 50x is because the efficiency of ASIC's has lowered the cost of mining equipment on a per bitcoin basis.

The price floor for widgets in his example was short term. It doesn't last forever, but he proved my theory because for the time HE WAS MAKING WIDGETS they had value based on the cost of creation. so much so that other companies started making them. After they are worth less no is going to make them. 
Everyone on this comment board is arguing in agreement with my economic theory. The price floor exits while hash rate is active.
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:52:30
That specific time was when I really exacted the science of my algorithm. We are heading towards a new efficiency upgrade soon (within a week). That is why I'm so confident that we are currently in a pump part of a pump and dump.
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:54:44
please specify more on my lack of understanding, how so?
@_date: 2019-05-22 21:24:42
The algorithm incorporates depreciation, electrical costs, and other factors into converting hash rate into simple dollar values.
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:16:21
thank you
@_date: 2019-05-23 00:14:46
you can find the hash rate here: 
you can find old efficiencies here: 
I'm trying to make this easy for people. So people don't lose their money and have some sort of idea of how much a bitcoin is worth. I want to mature the bitcoin market so these pump and dumps stop doing so much damage. I've been in crypto for 6 years. I know more than 99% of all crypto traders. I am sharing my experience.
@_date: 2019-05-22 21:58:47
lol yes, why is it crazy to say that the bitcoin miners have a vested interest to demand bitcoin past a certain price point? Their demand is backed up by their infrastructure and electricity costs. The speculation above the floor price is hoopla and can change at any time. The people really invested (the miners/whales) will not let it go below the floor price no matter what the speculators say/do. 
Try selling a diamond for a dollar, it will be easy.
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:15:50
Did you look at the price floor? The speculation is out of control even still ;) after the most recent dump
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:15:02
Dude, why did you go?
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:43:48
read the site, I post my data. look for fundamental data archive button man. It is right there. scroll down. 
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:43:01
Why don't you look at it, and then tell me you wouldn't benefit from knowing the wholesale cost of bitcoin and using that information to recognize when the market is in a bubble. 
To not use this data is like buying a house without knowing how much the materials cost. bruh
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:27:21
how so?
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:27:49
I made this so that people can ask questions and test my analysis ;)
