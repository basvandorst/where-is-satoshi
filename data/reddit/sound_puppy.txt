I guess it doesn't matter since we won't be around for the end.

It's still worth consideration even if just for entertainment value. Besides, the next hundred years is deeply rooted in the present. Without future consideration, we might as well forget about environmental protection, emission reduction, and we'll never live to see another Alien civilization, so why bother looking for Earth like planets?

Bitcoin is a perfect example of how the economy is flawed. There is no value in a bitcoin. Its completely useless, just like a dollar is. If you want true value to be measured you need a credit system. A persons value is more than just what things they have amassed. 
Should we really be working hard to calculate these complex solutions, just so the early adopters can get more rich? Or should we be working on things that improve society and actually matter?

hmm. If there is a finite amount, how can it not be possible for a single person to buy every one, given they have enough dollars?

Someone out there with a lot of wallets is playing the market like a violin.

So is it possible for one person to own all the bitcoins?
