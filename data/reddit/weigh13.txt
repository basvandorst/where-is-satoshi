This is why you should by some every week regardless of price and set some aside to by large dips.

Cause one is done with consent and the other is by force so there is less incentive to do a good job when you have a captive market. Also, if you think people in government aren't doing it for their own profit, I don't know what to say.

If people paid for these services in the free market we would have better and cheaper version of all of them. Making people pay for things without consent isn't a solution to anything.
@_date: 2019-07-30 02:56:31
You just have to use it once a month to keep it active. I would just buy a stick of gum when the price was surging that month. I wish this would come back. It was a such a great card!

I agree with all of these except their being only one currency. That will never happen and if it does, it will only be because a Tyrannical government decrees it.

I think any healthy ecosystem will have multiple choices if both crypto and more traditional currency methods.

How do you prove that its your wallet without showing them your private key?
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:28:52
This really only applies with large spikes in appreciation. If bitcoin, for instance, stabilizes at some number and begins to only grow very slowly, perhaps even predictably, then it would not stop spending of the currency today because tomorrow it won't be that different and it would actually give people more power over their finances by giving them the ability to plan better for the future.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:53:15
Ah! Thank you! This makes perfect sense. So I did receive the .02396 back, it just doesn't look like that on the wallet. Thanks for the link!

You can do instant buys on coinbase with a debit or credit card. No waiting at all. Just a small fee.

@_date: 2018-10-30 19:03:32
Market competition is a beautiful thing. Without the middle man of the government taking our money and giving some of it to road companies how much more efficient could our roads become?
But its not about figuring out how things have to be in the future, it's about realizing its wrong to take money from people by force to pay for things. Government isn't corrupt, it's designed to operate that way. As long as people make excuses for it and pretend like roads have never been made without governments the larger our governments debt will grow and the more money taken from productive people.
@_date: 2018-10-30 13:18:12
Well the CIA sells drugs but I'm thinking more through voluntary services that compete in a system where you can choose which services you want to pay for and what you don't. (Sounds kind of familiar though...)
@_date: 2018-10-30 17:32:51
There should be no government angencies. Those angencies are why our government (not the country) is in debt!! They can't and will never be run efficiently because that's not the point of the government.

Actually yeah something like that. We already private military contractors. But honestly the best military is a well armed citizenry. That is the primary reason the US has never been invaded. We have more guns in more hands than any other country on earth.

Which miner would suggest to someone wanting to do just that? I mined back in the day when the GPU was still usable to do so, but I also used an online pool website. I'd want to be more in control and not have someone taking some of my mining profits. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:57:09
This is pretty close to our current system. This is a fiefdom where you can't own land but must rent it from the Lord. The government is the Lord of the land and none of us can own property or land without going through them, and even then you don't really own it, you rent land from the government until you die and they rent it to the next person.

That is a great strategy actually. I don't know why it didn't occur to me to use limit buys in that manner. buy 50 bucks now, set it to buy 100 at a 6k and then 150 at 5500, etc... Very nice and simple strategy.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:48:17

Looks to be unblocked now. I was able to trade back my BCH to BTC at the peak last night, so I'm happy about how that worked out. Would have sucked if it was blocked last night. 
Could I have used Kraken to buy BTC with BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:30:59
That was fun! I put 1/5 of my bitcoins into BCH for a couple days and doubled those bitcoins! All in all not too shabby.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:23:01
Awesome, thank you for that explanation! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:37:58

"According to Katsunori Sago, the fair value of bitcoin should be around $US100 — nearly 99 per cent below its current level. "
Not, I think it should be and here is my argument for that case... just IT SHOULD BE. This is a horribly written article. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:23:10
No problem, this should be a place for learning, especially now that lots of new people are coming into the space. Most of us are on some stage of the learning process when it comes to crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:45:18
Thats a terrible analogy. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:12:26
That's smart!
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:25:29
Because right after the fork everyone will be selling their 2X and using the money to buy more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:32:50
Exactly my point!
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:10:40
Is LTC like a 100 times more expensive over there?
@_date: 2019-02-23 02:39:41
Why not? Its free advertising!
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:51:20
Its all a part of the process. Greed is a driving factor, it isn't evil by default. Without greed we wouldn't have the technology that bitcoin is built on in the first place. Wanting a better life and creating better tools was also driven by greed and desire. We are just on the wild west of that technology and so we are seeing a gold rush phenomenon. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:03:20
Just buy in a little now as we hit the BTC low again.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:54:52
That's like telling a prisoner who is wrongly accused that he should feel grateful that the government has built a roof over his head and pays for his meals. Without them he would have nothing! Actually no, without them he'd have better housing and better food and he'd also be FREE. 
PS. I'm curious how you think taxes pay for "society" itself. Are you saying ancient cultures or tribes didn't have society if they didn't have governments or pay taxes? Do tell!

I bought BCH at 800 and sold right after the peak of 2.5k. My transaction took like 30 minutes but I caught it on the way down using shapeshift to buy right back into bitcoin. I more than doubled that bit of my bitcoins I was willing to gamble with. Very fun couple days there. :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:06:19
There is no such thing as utopia. True freedom of the individual would be close though. I'd just be happy with a society where all obligations are chosen voluntarily and not forced upon you through unchosen debt and laws forced upon you at gun point.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:41:58
But how can you prove you weren't buying something with that money or exchanging it for something else? Would you have to prove to the IRS that you owned the wallet it was sent to?

@_date: 2017-11-11 14:32:54
Well true, but its a knife falling but you don't know where the floor is so you still have to grab it as some point while its still technically falling not knowing where it might stop (or perhaps on a bounce which would be even more dangerous with a knife).
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:28:48
So, wait a minute, according to this sending your bitcoin from coinbase to another wallet to store offline would be a taxable event.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:06:33
Exactly right! And it becomes harder and harder over time to mine them.
@_date: 2019-02-05 03:25:14
It looks bad on this company.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:37:16
I don't know what you're talking about. I put in 1/5 of my BTC into BCH and more than doubled those bitcoins when I bought back in at the peak. That was totally awesome!
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:35:58
It makes sense. The characters are morons.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:28:34
Seems to me this is one bitcoin divided into .125 segments getting ready for transit on the block chain, which was a large chain tied around a pack of donkeys and taken from town to town for local exchanges.

There is one huge difference I can think of:
The mortgage crises in large part occurred because the government was forcing banks to give loans to people that could not pay these loans back. This is what led to a huge amount of toxic loans which the bank then tried to hide by combining them and selling them. No one is being mandated to buy bitcoin, we are choosing to.

There already will never be 21 million bitcoin because many have already been lost. You are correct that bitcoin is extremely deflationary because there can only ever be less and less over time as people die and bitcoin is lost to the great ledger in the sky.

That does appear to be the case. Unless you're like me and leave your coins on Coinbase during the bicoin cash fork. They claimed down the road we would see those coins but still nothing. They are being more specific in their promises for this one, but I'm still not sure I can trust them.
