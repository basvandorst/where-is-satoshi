She couldn't find a way and doesn't wanna do it in any roundabout way. Thanks though!

Ok, I give you permission, as soon as you buy one Bitcoin right now, and if you don't spend it by the end of this year, you can. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:13:13
It's fake? So sell all your Bitcoin and save yourself all this needless anxiety. I'm recommending this for your own good, arse.

Predict it now: What, right now, would constitutes a "crash"? Name am approximate dollar amount and let's see if it hits that number by next Friday.

I checked Wikipedia to see if you're right about that, but there's no birth date or even a birth YEAR recorded there, so you may be right -

Forget Reddit Gold; you deserve a Reddit Bitcoin for that.

Please keep posting comments like that. They serve as a great motivation to make sure I'll be standing at my voting location at 7 AM on Election Day, AND that I'll continue express my support for President Trump every single day until then, everywhere I can. Please keep insulting me. Write another comment even angrier than the last!

Gotta love this line:


Yup, and just rose to $7,400 and appears to be leveling off at $7,300. All in a day's work.

Yo wake up, Whammo, BTC just hit $8,004.59 (at Friday, Nov 17, 2017 at 01:14:11 UTC). You don't wanna be snoozin' went it rockets past $9,000 next week. I'm just tellin' ya right now!!!
Full disclosure: I don't own any Bitcoin. I just like reading and talking about it.

vitriolic hate? my comment was charming and friendly invitation. I know you're secretly a Trump supporter who's just imitating some of the more dramatic opponents. That's why I encourage you to keep going with it

Then sell off all your Bitcoin, because he just promoted a Bitcoin-using pro-Trump website to his 43 Million followers! Here's a good alternative:

Fuckin awesome. I'm seeing 7561.54 on coinmarketcap. I saw 7532, then 7551. ..all in the past 20 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:10:48
I agree! :)
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:51:43

@_date: 2017-11-17 15:09:41
The only coins I trust are: 
-&gt;  Sexcoin $0.021820

and 
-&gt;  AntiBitcoin $0.005142
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:58:49
Yes I do, and I'm glad you're bringing it up also. Keep talking about it to spread the word!
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:33:47


Exactly, and  that supports my point that it hasn't taken off; maybe it hasn't taken off *yet,* but it hasn't taken off, as of right now. I'm not complaining about it, I'm just stating it. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:32:03
I'm actually from New York, never been to Canada. My name is based on a joke from the 2016 U.S. election. Other online names of mine include "blondegirl256" and "Proud2BChinese" and also "ArizonaGrandfather."

Taken off from where it was, but not "taken off" in the general sense of being something that the average person is using, like the Internet, email, Google Search, Skype, smartphones, and Facebook. I'm talking about real ubiquitous mainstream use, where it would be stupid to ask someone "Hey, you use Bitcoin?," the same way it'd be stupid to ask someone if they use any of the other things I named--and when the answer *is* no (at least in America), it's virtually always because a person uses a later competitor (like Snapchat instead of Facebook, or FaceTime, Kik, or Viber instead of Skype).

But the matter of how widely adopted and used it is, is perhaps the most significant question of all. If the users and holders lose faith in it, abandon it, what good is it that the technology itself is still running? It's like a bunch of servers hosting a website that no one ever visits.

Yeah, exactly! Like, for instance, the past 141 seasons of Major League Baseball are just one single 141-year-long season. Or better yet, every game is just part of one long intermittent ongoing game between Team A vs. Team B. It's weird how anyone want to watch it after seeing just a few minutes of it. Same goes for football, basketball, hockey, and whatever else. Good thing I don't play or watch any games. I'm not into things like differences or specifics or details. I just eat and sleep. And the same goes for money--like, people are getting rich from Bitcoin? Ok, there have always been people with more money than other people, and that's just another game. Big whoop. I rise above it by staying here in my pajamas in my bedroom all day and no one can stop me!

And see this, from November: Are Vegas Casinos Mining Cryptocurrency?
(Of the videos embedded here, at least watch the 2nd one ("MGM Grand ...") and at 4:00, you'll see "MGM CTO Briefing - Payments / Bitcoin - Stripe")

Nah, not fluid; just like pretending to be different people when I'm online. You can see lots of people like me in the BlackPeopleTwitter subreddit. And for people pretending to be even richer than as rich as they already actually are, there's this sub $-)

How millions of people will be in relation to Bitcoin throughout 2018
