The issue is that you weren't able to place a bet because the countdown had finished and a "no more bets" message would have already appeared - placing chips on the table isn't "placing a bet" if you've already been told betting is closed. And the fact that you already knew this would happen because you'd tried it before just shows that you're trying to extort and defame Cloudbet. I can't believe they even gave you 1 btc when this isn't even really a bug, it's just you trying to exploit an idiosyncracy.

No problem, I was going to post a referral link, looked at the rules, then figured I may as well make a post anyway

Funny how you started the video after their countdown had finished and the "no more bets message" comes up - you can tell because there's no countdown in the bottom corner (like there is at the end of the video for the next hand). If you're going to try and get sympathy on the internet at least show the whole story - take your 1 BTC and be happy they gave you anything!

If you read all the,comments about it you'll see that it was actually the guy trying to scam/extort cloudbet, he even took it to a dispute resolution site and they ruled against him

It didn't cost you anything because you didn't place a bet. Go to any casino in the world and place chips on the table after the dealer says "no more bets" and see what happens...
