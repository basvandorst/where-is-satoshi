You're the one that gives red pills? LMAO
Here are some undisputable facts for you:
Support for Bitcoin Core is at an all time low, while support for BU is rising steadily. Miners are beginning to realize they're being played by Core, and are slowly getting in line with the majority of Bitcoin holders, of whom a vast majority (90+%) support BU. Even among moderate pools like Slush, up to 25% of miners are signalling BU.
And no, these polls can not be gamed, they are based on however many Bitcoin voters own, which is a system Core used to frequent as well until they realized they lost the majority of holders to the other aisle.
How is this an irrelevant minority? The scales are tipping, Core is done. BU is inevitable at this point.

*"I don't think there are a lot of BU supporters."*
Then proceed to act like it's a fact? According to a recent poll on Bitcoin.com (which Core used to frequent for polls as well until the scales tipped in BUs favor) where people voted based on the amount of Bitcoin they actually owned, a vast majority of holders are in support of BU. And why would the ones that actually owned a majority of Bitcoin want to harm it? Please explain.
But that doesn't fit the narrative of this subreddit and can't possibly be true because you don't think it is, right?
Have you ever considered that it's actually Core trying to manipulate peoples' opinions on reddit, and not the other aisle?
Consider this red pill a free gift.
