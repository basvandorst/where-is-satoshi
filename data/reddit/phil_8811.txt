I've got it on my site:
@_date: 2014-10-08 17:15:16
Good to hear, I hope you enjoy the game.  
I try to keep what I can in bitcoin, but because of the recent crash I'm temporarily cashing out most of what I receive.
@_date: 2014-09-16 01:44:44
Check out my site,   
Many games are in stock and instantly delivered, and I can get anything else from the Steam store on request.
@_date: 2014-05-12 06:01:03
Done.  =)  
[SteamBitShop.com](  
I sell Steam games for bitcoin. Most of them are delivered seconds after broadcasting payment. I also take requests for any game or DLC that's not listed on the site.

I don't sell wallet cards but I can get you any game on Steam.

I will. Once it hits a flash or daily sale I'll reduce my price.
@_date: 2014-07-13 05:14:42
I solved this using my bitcoin node, [easybitcoin-php][1], and the following PHP code.  
Visiting the page and passing a tx hash will output "high priority" if the tx has a standard or higher fee, or if it has no fee but high enough priority, otherwise it will output "low priority," or "error" if there was a problem.
    &lt;?php
    require_once('/var/www/easybitcoin.php');
    
    $bitcoin = new Bitcoin('user', 'pass', '127.0.0.1', '8332');
    
    $tx_hash = $_GET['tx'];
    $tx = $bitcoin-&gt;getrawtransaction($tx_hash, 1);
    
    $coin_age = 0;
    $in_value = 0;
    $out_value = 0;
    $output_too_small = false;
    
    foreach($tx['vin'] as $input) {
      $tx_in = $bitcoin-&gt;getrawtransaction($input['txid'], 1);
      $value = $tx_in['vout'][$input['vout']]['value'];
      $coin_age += $value * 1e8 * $tx_in['confirmations'];
      $in_value += $value;
    }
    foreach($tx['vout'] as $output) {
      $out_value += $output['value'];
      if ($output['value'] &lt; 0.01) {
        $output_too_small = true;
      }
    }
    
    $size = strlen($tx['hex']) / 2;
    $priority = $coin_age / $size;
    $fee_per_byte = (($in_value - $out_value) * 1e8) / $size;
    
    if (is_numeric($priority)) {
      if (($priority &gt; 57600000 &amp;&amp; $size &lt; 1000 &amp;&amp; $output_too_small == false) || $fee_per_byte &gt;= 10) {
        echo 'high priority';
      } else {
        echo 'low priority';
      }
    } else {
      echo 'error';

The problem with those is that the keys/links I'm selling are one-time use, meaning I'd need to set up a new file or payment page for every item, instead of for every product. Thanks for the suggestions though.
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:47:10
I understand your skepticism, but in this case it is misplaced.  
I've acquired all of my games through legitimate means, either through reputable, well-known sites like Amazon, or through Steam trading. Besides the feedback others have posted here, I have over 2 years of flawless reputation from Steam trading. I chose not to include that in the OP because it links to my Steam profile, but here is some of it that can be found in my post history anyway:  
[confirmed trades](
Also, buying games from a third party does not in any way violate Steam's ToS. The only issue with third party sites is whether or not they can be trusted.
Edit: One more thing I'd like to point out is that every game I sell is region-free, meaning it will activate just fine in any country without using a VPN or anything like that.

@_date: 2014-07-12 07:52:02
That makes sense, but I'm actually more concerned about a payment with no fee being dropped from the network after a product has been delivered. I can already make 0-fee payments wait for a confirmation before delivery, but it would be nice if users sending legitimate (high priority) 0-fee transactions didn't have to wait.

Edited to exclude that right after posting, but the solution is to use an Electrum brain wallet, or one with similarly high entropy.
@_date: 2013-09-11 04:31:46
You're able to make your own 12-word passphrase with Electrum, you just need to encode it into hex first. However it's not recommended, see [this thread]( for some discussion.
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:16:40

You could easily do test runs of the public key generation and compare them with results from another machine, then confirm by sending small amounts.  
If you're worried about attacks that are complex enough to defeat all the security measures I described, you'd better write your own OS and software.
@_date: 2013-08-24 05:19:40
It kind of is, since Bitcoin is an ideal solution to the problem described in the article.
@_date: 2013-08-13 23:05:07
The difficulty would have to drop first, before profitability would go up for the remaining miners.
@_date: 2013-09-19 22:33:52


[Electrum]( or [Multibit](
@_date: 2013-09-18 21:23:01
Don't store your savings in an online wallet, or even a wallet on a networked PC. Use cold storage. I recommend [Electrum](  
What do you mean by "can't access it"? Is their site not loading for you?
@_date: 2013-08-26 05:17:21
To be fair, I believe "our" interests overlap with theirs, for the most part.
@_date: 2013-10-27 18:35:29
I've sold a couple hundred digital games on Bitmit, and bought a few items as well. I highly recommend it, for both buyers and sellers. The experience has only improved over time as they add new features, and their support staff was very helpful in the few instances I needed to contact them.
Here's [my Bitmit page]( if anyone happens to be looking for cheap games ;)
@_date: 2013-10-15 19:31:45
[Pywallet]( should work.
@_date: 2013-08-26 01:08:20
I highly recommend using Electrum for offline storage. It's easy to use, but also has a lot of advanced features if you need them. Here's the [official tutorial](
@_date: 2013-09-18 01:11:26
Because it's 19kb and the minimum recommended fee is 0.0001 per kb.
@_date: 2013-08-23 21:44:56
I'm highly confident that they erase logs, however you can't be 100% sure. A trustless p2p mixing service would be ideal, but none exist yet, as far as I know.
@_date: 2013-08-22 03:09:59
For now, use [paper wallets]( (store multiple copies in safe locations). Later on, invest in a good hardware wallet. You could get the [Trezor]( now but I'd wait for more options.
@_date: 2013-09-15 01:57:53
I'd recommend not even using the default client. Use [Electrum]( or [Multibit]( and you don't need to download the blockchain.  
If you really want to use Bitcoin-Qt, you can speed up the download by grabbing most of the blockchain from a [torrent](  As far as your connection issue, I'm not sure, maybe just let it run for a while to find other nodes.
@_date: 2013-10-18 18:53:43
Unless you really need some specific feature that Armory has, I'd switch to Electrum.
@_date: 2013-08-13 23:44:09
Right, but that isn't going to have much impact on profitability compared to difficulty. For example, if half of the total mining power drops off the network, about half as many blocks will be found per hour, until the next difficulty adjustment.
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:19:41
No problem. All you need to restore the entire wallet is the seed phrase. It's deterministic, meaning you can generate as many addresses as you want and the seed will restore all of their private keys.
@_date: 2013-08-24 02:28:30
Yeah, that's fine.
@_date: 2013-10-04 04:35:28
cgminer isn't able to, use [vanitygen]( instead.
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:32:47
Definitely easier, just not as portable.
@_date: 2013-08-27 19:09:55
Since bitcoin saves store owners money, they will likely incentivize customers to use it. This could be done in many ways, the most obvious being a discount for bitcoin purchases.  
As for ease of use, that will change. Using something just like a credit card to pay with bitcoin may not be that far off.
@_date: 2013-08-25 22:03:40
Yeah... it's mind-boggling.
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:08:45
You could boot an offline OS via USB or use a Raspberry Pi, to reduce cost. Regardless, I would say the additional cost is worth it by far when dealing with any significant amount of bitcoin.  
@_date: 2013-08-31 05:56:26
Funny you should mention that, the [link]( I posted in the time travel thread pretty much discusses the same idea under the heading "The Government Strikes Back." Even if something like that were to happen, there will always be a ~~black~~ free market, no matter how risky it is.  
Anyway, we could speculate on such wild theories endlessly, but more than likely Satoshi was/is just a brilliant programmer who had no idea what path Bitcoin would eventually take.
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:26:38
Malware on the PC could still easily intercept the private key and deliver it to an attacker once an internet connection is restored.
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:58:22
You need to turn on expert mode in preferences, then right-clicking an address in the receive tab will show the freeze and prioritize options.
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:48:02
No problem :)

This is one reason I really like Electrum. Your 12 word seed phrase restores your entire wallet, including change addresses, and it's very secure. (128+ bits of entropy)
@_date: 2013-10-25 00:21:29
I love Electrum, my only significant complaint with it is not being able to send to multiple addresses using the GUI.  
If you could add user-friendly support for multi-signature transactions, that would be a huge step forward.  Support for the upcoming payment protocol would be important as well.
@_date: 2013-08-19 04:08:30
The blockchain.info app supports using paper wallets, as described [here]( However I don't think it can import the private key permanently, which would be nice.  
Edit: Actually it can, very easily, just press menu, then "scan private key."
@_date: 2013-11-06 02:08:31
Right, sometimes it's just easier to think of a private key as being equivalent to whatever amount of BTC is unlocks.
@_date: 2013-09-15 19:35:33
By selling that much BTC, he'd crash the market, defeating the whole purpose. Besides that, I think it's likely that a large portion of BTC mined from early blocks is lost forever. Satoshi and the few others mining that early on had no idea BTC would reach $100+ or even $1, so they'd be much less inclined to keep it safe.
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:22:36
Try this:  
@_date: 2013-09-28 23:02:33
1) To be safe, only invest in bitcoin by buying bitcoins.  
2) You're right on this one, trying to start mining now is a gamble at best. Refer to point 1.  
3) Be careful, know what you're doing. Problem solved.  
4) Don't use a human generated passphrase.
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:48:39
Yes, it lets you prioritize or freeze sending addresses.
@_date: 2013-10-08 19:42:42
You can create offline storage with [Electrum]( which would allow you to spend coins as needed while still keeping them completely secure.
@_date: 2013-09-14 04:33:44
To be anonymous you'll need to avoid exchanges. You could use localbitcoins or torATM, but I imagine it would take several, possibly many transactions to reach your goal.  
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:00:27
You could boot linux from a USB drive, just be sure to disable all network connections and never boot that drive while connected to the internet.
@_date: 2013-09-08 22:36:09
It's relatively safe, but not 100% safe. For large amounts of BTC you should definitely use cold storage. (an offline computer or paper wallet)
@_date: 2013-09-14 04:23:46










(from the [NIST recommendation](  
Could someone confirm whether Bitcoin uses this specific algorithm? As far as I can tell it doesn't.
@_date: 2013-08-15 02:53:19
An escrow service would probably be a better option.
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:49:45
Posted that into the Electrum subforum for you, hope you get it sorted out soon.  
@_date: 2013-10-27 07:57:43
I use a dedicated offline computer (Raspberry Pi) to run an installation of Electrum. This allows me to spend coins from my cold storage while keeping unspent coins secure. Instructions for doing this can be found [here.](  
As Cowboy_Coder stated, you can also boot from a live CD/USB to achieve the same effect, just be sure to unplug your network device(s) once Electrum is installed.  
If you don't plan on spending the coins for some time, you also have the option of simply writing down the 12 word seed phrase and using it to recover them later.
@_date: 2013-08-31 01:02:41
That was entertaining. Makes me wonder how long until we see a novel or film with cryptocurrency playing a major role.  
Here's [another take]( on this kind of scenario. Both are far-fetched, to say the least, but still interesting to think about.
@_date: 2013-08-15 04:09:30
Actually it costs $0.95 per transaction, takes up to 3 business days, and has daily and monthly transfer limits:   
So, no, it's not a great competitor to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-31 04:16:31
You're right, cold storage is the only way to be sure. Electrum is my preferred method for now, but I'm hoping for an inexpensive, open hardware wallet in the near future.
@_date: 2013-08-24 01:39:05
There are a few ideas out there. [This one]( in particular looks promising. In fact it can be used right now, with some effort.
@_date: 2013-08-24 06:47:40
I was going to respond, then I realized this is your anti-bitcoin troll account.
@_date: 2013-08-15 02:06:34
If proper security measures are taken, it would be impossible to steal your coins, and impossible to know that you even have them.  
Making Bitcoin illegal at this point is extremely unlikely since its use by legitimate businesses is rapidly growing. Over-regulation is a concern, but there would be ways around it, especially due to Bitcoin's decentralized nature.
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:07:52
A paper wallet would be the simplest way to give them BTC. [This site]( has a really nice design with instructions printed onto the wallet. As for clients, I'd personally recommend [Electrum.](
@_date: 2013-10-20 06:04:00
The basic idea is to secure your private keys on a small device so that they never touch your PC. It's like using an offline Armory/Electrum install, but far more convenient. [Trezor]( is the best example as of now.
@_date: 2013-10-13 20:44:27
[bitmit.net]( :)
@_date: 2013-08-18 04:35:16
I think we can expect Bitcoin banks to be established at some point, offering secure storage of Bitcoins for average people who don't want to get into the more technical aspects of it. This would significantly reduce the amount of lost coins.
@_date: 2013-08-19 03:24:16
To be sure, simply withdraw them to a wallet on your own computer.
@_date: 2013-08-23 20:57:04
Yes, the coins would be mixed with coins other people have deposited, meaning there should be no link between what you deposit and what you withdraw.
@_date: 2013-08-31 05:22:26
Found the source:  
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:42:36
Yes, but I would generate the seed using dice rolls or similar, rather than trusting digital RNG.
@_date: 2013-09-15 19:42:39
Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:47:41
I was thinking of using both. Use true randomness (e.g. dice rolls) to generate the Electrum seed.
@_date: 2013-08-19 06:23:02


That's extremely improbable. On the other hand, I don't think it's wise at all to invest *only* in bitcoin, as the OP seems to suggest.
@_date: 2013-10-20 00:04:50
Coinbase doesn't allow you to purchase with credit cards, it uses them as a backup funding source. It could happen at some point, but I'm sure it would only be for users who are level 2 verified. They might even add additional verification due the the risks associated with accepting credit cards.
@_date: 2013-08-19 00:27:23
Once you've got the Bitcoins, I'd recommend Electrum for offline storage since it's easy to use and "light" (you don't need to download the whole blockchain). Here's [a quick tutorial](
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:18:38
If you're going through the trouble of using a separate PC, might as well keep it fully offline and use Electrum. (or Armory if you really want to download the blockchain)
@_date: 2013-08-29 06:38:48
You can either use the -datadir flag to change where bitcoin-qt stores data, or create a symbolic link from another drive to the bitcoin directory. Creating a symlink can be done using the command line, but [this software]( lets you do it with a few clicks.
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:00:24
I believe it's possible to flash the radio firmware in order to disable it completely.

The password prevents you from exporting private keys or spending coins. Once you export a private key it can be used without a password. (This is true of any wallet software.)  
The seed can be used as a brain wallet, but it is highly secure. (128+ bits of entropy)  
Importing a master public key only allows you to view the addresses in the wallet and generate unsigned transactions, not spend coins.
@_date: 2013-10-27 07:15:43
True. If you feel like testing your luck, go for it.

@_date: 2013-11-06 03:29:44
I just tried this, and it does appear to export the keys. However, when I imported them into another wallet they added empty addresses that aren't part of my cold storage wallet. 
I'm not sure why it does that rather than simply disabling the export option for watch-only wallets, or displaying an error message.
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:42:59
Sounds good, just remember that the order of the words in the seed is important.
@_date: 2013-08-31 05:15:26
I was being completely sarcastic, but I guess the reasoning would be to scare people away from bitcoin.

If you still have the hard drive, try plugging it into another computer and searching for your wallet.dat

You should not use an online wallet for long-term storage, there are too many risks involved. Ideally you'd have a dedicated offline PC to store your coins. You can find a guide on how to do this with Electrum [here]( Note that a separate PC is not required, you could unplug your current PC from the internet and boot a fresh live linux USB/DVD as well.  
A paper wallet could work as well, but with Electrum you'd be able to make transactions easily when you need to. If you do go with a paper wallet, use the same procedure when generating it. (fresh OS with computer and printer disconnected from all networks)  
Edit: You could also do a hybrid of those two methods, by starting a fresh Electrum wallet offline then writing down the seed and storing it safely.
@_date: 2013-08-18 18:22:07
The method I described above would accomplish that.
@_date: 2013-09-29 18:45:03
Only brain wallets with weak passphrases are insecure.
@_date: 2013-08-15 02:39:20
Right, which is why projects such as [Tor]( and [Talis]( exist, to anonymize your internet activity. By using a coin mixing service in addition, it would be practically impossible to link your Bitcoin transactions to you.  
Of course, this might be seen by some as an excellent case for making Bitcoin use illegal.

@_date: 2013-09-29 19:59:24
Your encrypted wallet.dat isn't actually a brainwallet, since you can't extract any private keys from the passphrase itself. Without your wallet.dat no one could know your private keys, even if they guessed your passphrase.  
That being said, it's important to keep your private keys safe. For any large amount of BTC you should use offline storage.
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:30:05
Right, that would be the next-best thing to having a dedicated offline computer.

* It's normal to have multiple addresses, you can pick any of them to receive coins. It's recommended to use a fresh address for each transaction, and Electrum will generate as many as you need.  
* You can install the same wallet on multiple machines by restoring from your first wallet's seed.

Mixing services exist which will take your BTC and exchange it for someone else's, breaking the transaction chain that links to you.  
As for your bonus question, that depends on which wallet you use. Electrum can both "prioritize" and "freeze" each address you own, allowing you to control which address(es) will send BTC.
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:03:52
You could sell stuff on [Bitmit]( or other similar sites, or try to find some work that pays in bitcoin over at @_date: 2013-08-17 08:02:59

This, exactly. Well said.
@_date: 2013-09-30 07:50:53

Multiple private keys are derived using the chain code and root key. They can be used to recover your private keys, you just need to get past that error. I think the easiest way is to remove the watch-only wallet, then try importing your backup again, but I don't know exactly how to do that.
@_date: 2013-08-09 05:46:19
I think it would make a lot more sense to develop an Android/iOS app for this purpose, or even a dedicated OS for more security. There are a lot of old smartphones out there just waiting to become portable, easy-to-use hardware wallets...

I would go with [Electrum]( You could export your private keys from Qt into Electrum, but it's better to just send all your BTC to a new address generated by Electrum, to take advantage of its deterministic backup.  
Another option to consider is [Multibit](
@_date: 2013-08-24 01:56:07
You can use "apt-get -d install" on an online machine to download the packages without installing, then transfer them over to the offline machine and install. Packages are downloaded to /var/cache/apt/archives by default.

Most, but not all. One concern would be spyware on your own PC that could effectively negate your security measures. When dealing with significant amounts of BTC, better to be 100% sure it's safe than 99.99%.

The paper wallet should include a private key, and that's all you need to access the coins. I'm not really familiar with Armory, but another client like Electrum would be able to import the key just fine, and from there you could send the BTC where it needs to go.
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:39:58

@_date: 2013-10-30 18:33:37
That will work, or you can use "Export Unencrypted" and change the private key format to Bitcoin-Qt. You'll see the private keys listed after "priv" in the block of text it generates.
@_date: 2013-09-18 18:44:44
He has a valid point.
@_date: 2013-08-19 18:23:35
Yeah, that's a great solution for long term storage. Another one would be using an offline Electrum client to store private keys and an online one to generate transactions. That allows you to send coins from your cold storage easily while keeping what you don't spend secure.
@_date: 2013-09-16 20:27:45
One thing it has that I wish Electrum had is the ability to send to multiple addresses in one transaction. Can't think of anything else.
@_date: 2013-10-22 04:20:01
All the coins are still there except the first ones sent, which you received. Blockchain.info is in control of the address, so they'll be able to get you the rest.

I suppose physically disconnecting or destroying the antennas might be necessary. Still, I would rather do that than wait months for a dedicated hardware wallet.
@_date: 2013-08-26 18:54:17
Yes, your method is secure. One thing I'd recommend (if you're creating new keys fairly often) is using an Electrum seed instead of a single private key. That would give you an unlimited number of addresses to use, and no need to worry about change addresses if you wanted to spend part of your balance.
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:45:22
Right, the offline device is only used to sign transactions. It's not any less cold storage than Armory is, since your BTC is stored completely offline.
@_date: 2013-09-30 07:38:05
That site doesn't actually let you enter your own root key and chain code, only the paper backup, which I just realized after trying it.

Here's the offline tutorial from Electrum's site:  
@_date: 2013-08-16 05:49:53
Yes, because it could lead to Bitcoin being so widely used that you wouldn't even care about converting to fiat.
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:06:15
Not exactly, since Electrum doesn't use the Diceware word list. You'd generate a 32 character hex string and input that as the seed.
@_date: 2013-09-30 07:04:10
Right, I was thinking of normal paper wallets. You can use [brainwallet.org]( to recover each private key from the backup.  I would save a copy of the website and run it from your own PC.
@_date: 2013-09-12 05:34:08

Here's a working software implementation: 
@_date: 2013-08-29 20:13:41
@_date: 2013-08-18 03:57:47
In the scenario you described, I don't know of an attack that could be used to steal your coins, but that doesn't mean such an attack doesn't exist. I guess my point is, when dealing with larger amounts of BTC, do you want 99.99% security or 100%?  
Personally, if I'm going through the trouble of booting a separate OS to sign transactions, I see no reason not to use true "cold storage."
@_date: 2013-10-20 19:04:41

If you did a "quick" format and haven't written data to the partition afterwards, then chances are pretty good that you'll be able to recover the file. I've found this free recovery software to work well:   
Note that it may not recover the filename, so you'd be looking for *.dat files and may need to check each one by attempting to import it into a BTC client.

@_date: 2013-08-26 02:30:13
As a unit of currency, bitcoin's value doesn't depend on the dollar or any other currency, it's simply based on what people are willing to exchange for it. If enough people were to begin using it as money, it could potentially overtake some major currencies in use today, but honestly that is a long way off, if it happens at all.   
The real power of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, in my opinion, is the fact that no central authority controls it, making it more free from human corruption than any state-issued currency. It also has key advantages over other alternative currencies, such as gold.
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:50:38

Since actually buying some BTC might take more time than you have, I sent you a dime's worth. No need to repay it in any way, just go spread the word :)  
Also, in case you weren't aware, the default fee on many clients will eat up half of that, but you can safely set the fee to 0.0001

You should really use an offline wallet for the best possible security. Someone mentioned Armory, but I would recommend [Electrum]( instead, it's quite easy to [set up and use.](

Here's the exact procedure, if you want to spend coins from your offline wallet safely:  
@_date: 2013-10-14 21:46:12
Electrum is great. It will also let you send coins from your offline wallet pretty easily, using [this procedure.](
@_date: 2013-10-16 18:54:00
If you set it up properly, it would work, but I would use [Electrum]( instead. It has a lot more features, including the ability to send BTC from your cold storage while keeping it offline.

Maybe someone could put together a tool that merges data from these sites, or automatically copies data between sites?

Any connection to the internet will be inherently risky. For maximum security, generate a fresh private key offline. (A dedicated PC is ideal, but a live USB/DVD on a PC unplugged from all networks is acceptable.) To send BTC, you'd generate the transaction with the online PC, sign it using the offline PC, and broadcast it with the online PC.  
Instructions for doing this via Electrum can be found [here](  
I recently tried installing Electrum on Talis without success, but I'm sure it's possible. Since you'd only be using it offline, a standard Linux distro would be fine.

I agree, use Electrum and you don't have to worry about change address keys or making a new backup after a certain number of transactions.
@_date: 2013-08-22 06:57:48
Go with MultiBit if you want a simple client, or Electrum if you want more advanced features and a deterministic wallet. Either one will let you import your existing private keys so you don't need to send to a new address.
@_date: 2013-08-21 20:36:27
What method did you use to import it?
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:32:51
No, you're going to need software of some kind. You could conceivably write it yourself, or just review the code for an existing client.

You're able to verify that you have in fact received bitcoins by checking the blockchain, which is the public record of all bitcoin transactions.  
Based on the questions you're asking here, I'd recommend reading up on some of the technical aspects of Bitcoin. [This video]( is a great introduction.

The article is posted at the Online Trading Academy, and the one view that's positive rather than negative or neutral comes from someone who's part of that group... interesting.  
Some of these "experts" are seriously misinformed, too.

Would you happen to have a source for that? I was trying to dig one up but didn't have any luck.

Let's hope the FCEN and other regulators get this through their heads, if nothing else.

Electrum is equally as safe, much faster, and uses far less resources.  The only real reason I'm aware of to use Armory is if you want to run a full bitcoin node.
@_date: 2013-08-28 05:26:06
If mx2 uses any of the same inputs as mx1, nodes that have already received mx1 will not broadcast mx2 or add it to their memory pool, so mx2 will not be included in a block.
@_date: 2013-08-17 04:13:11
There's a fix for that, it's called using appropriate security measures.

Yes, it does. Check out the full procedure here:

That's correct, assuming the private key was generated securely.

A smartphone's antennas can be disabled easily enough, even forced to remain off despite user action. A graphing calculator might work as a hardware wallet, but I think a properly configured smartphone is a much better choice overall.

The OS is open source, you could potentially review every line of code yourself. The BIOS is closed source, however it's not really a BIOS, its only purpose is to initiate a bootloader from the SD card.  
Even if the software or firmware were infected, it's not a problem. Since the Pi is not connected to the internet and will remain that way, it isn't possible for malware to send your data to an attacker. The only real concern is that the random number generation is compromised in some way. To eliminate that potential threat, simply use a source of true randomness to generate your seed or private key.

They'd be worthless for mining BTC, but they could still mine other SHA-256 coins.  
Edit: And that's all they'd be good for, since there aren't really any other applications for repeatedly doing sha256(sha256()).
