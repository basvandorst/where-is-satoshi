The technology that powers Bitcoin has to be made sustainably. Someone needs to make a blockchain reporting network that is solar powered and ubiquitous. The whole crypto currency experiment rests on a functioning power grid and we need to be looking into developing low power/solar power P2P setups.
If the lights go out what do we have? Paper Wallets, etc but how do we verify? Crypto Currency in Crisis situations how much utility and value do they have.
Its like the elephant in the room. I would like to see some hardware made that allows people to transact by touching a device together or by linking up via a local low power system. Some work needs to be done.

These two terms have absolutely zero value.
I have done the reading the fine print does include the option of the FDIC having the option to pay out a percentage of a maximum of 10% per year of any amount covered. You will get 100% of any amount covered but you will get it over such a length as they decide.
They have legislation and legal clauses buried that essentially allow them sole discretion.
FROM THE FDIC WEBSITE:
**Is My Account Fully Insured?
This tool allows customers of a failed bank to determine whether their accounts are fully insured or if they need to contact FDIC**

People should read very very carefully the FDIC guaranteed rules governing deposits.  If you read carefully they can structure the payout of covered amounts at their discretion so that you only receive 10% of a covered amount PER YEAR.
So if you had 100k in an insured account they would pay you out at 10% of the value per year..by law and at their discretion...SURE you won't lose a penny...but you will only get the money they want to give you when they want to give it to you...Do some reading...drill down..and find the clauses...I did...and so BITCOIN is it

I wager that if people could get a hold of these people they would find out very quickly that the fees they took do not entitle them to take peoples money to cover their losses.

The first documented use of the Gay Bomb^T.M. occurred in Sept of 1983 in San Francisco Harbour. Casualties were extensive requiring acres of flannel and Chino's flown in from overseas to aid in relief. Moisturizer and Astroglide supply's were exhausted in a matter of hours creating an immediate shortage of cooking oil, vaseline and other lubricating factors. The arrival of WWF owner Vince Mc Mahon did little to help the situation as his ''kiss my ass club'' pay per view broke all records and crashed Visa &amp; Mastercard phone lines and computers. Thankfully there has been advanced research conducted by the NFL and NBA that conclusively demonstrates that the Gay Bomb has had no effect on their locker room and as such offer 100% protection from any effects.

Let me explain it to you like you're 5 on the morning of Sept 11th  
In New York City as the planes crashed and buildings fell and people died.  5 Israeli's danced for joy.
Considering all the suffering on that day and after their celebration was inappropriate. Jew's know what suffering is perhaps unlike any other people on the planet. The history of the people and the nation is one mixed with tragedy and sorrow. On Sept 11th the American people had visited upon them an act of infamy that did not warrant a jubilant celebration by anyone with an ounce of humanity

Bitcoin is bigger than the scandal this mess has created.
If you had the vision to buy the coins,then you had a look at the future and saw the opportunity. The future has not changed the opportunity is still there,I started out buying Bitcoin because I saw the future and I still see it. I was fortunate not to use Mt Gox even though I had an account there and Bitstamp as well.
BITCOIN is a BUY at any price under $500.00
The problems we face now are daunting but as a protocol there is far too much promise to give up now.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:55:05
Ok point taken
Bitcoin is a strong buy the protocol has intrinsic value as a frictionless mechanism for value transfer &amp; retention.

Exhibit  A:


(f)(1)(A) all payments made pursuant to this section on account of a closed Bank Insurance Fund member shall be made only from the Bank Insurance Fund 
So, if the fund runs dry, there isn't another possible source of funds that can be legally tapped without changing this wording. And that would take – wait for it – an act of Congress.  And the FDIC Act is very clear to spell out that the only insurance funds available to depositors are those that exist within the fund itself:
(f)(1)(A) all payments made pursuant to this section on account of a closed Bank Insurance Fund member shall be made only from the Bank Insurance Fund 
So, if the fund runs dry, there isn't another possible source of funds that can be legally tapped without changing this wording. And that would take – wait for it – an act of Congress.  
FDIC- You think you are covered...just like an insurance policy...you think you are covered...when in fact you are not. They don't have to pay you legally....AS SOON AS POSSIBLE is not within 10 days 10 months or  100 years...
Who decides whats possible? THEY DO.
If they run out of money in the fund...ITS NOT POSSIBLE
If Congress cant agree and change the act..ITS NOT POSSIBLE.
So guess what...you will get the amount they want to give you and when they want to give it to you...

Gayfish!! never die!
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:56:00
Its true. 
    Denial — As the reality of loss is hard to face, one of the first reactions to follow the loss is Denial. What this means is that the person is trying to shut out the reality or magnitude of their situation, and begin to develop a false, preferable reality.
    Anger — "Why me? It's not fair!"; "How can this happen to me?"; '"Who is to blame?"
    Once in the second stage, the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue. Because of anger, the person is very difficult to care for due to misplaced feelings of rage and envy. Anger can manifest itself in different ways. People can be angry with themselves, or with others, and especially those who are close to them. It is important to remain detached and nonjudgmental when dealing with a person experiencing anger from grief.
    Bargaining — "I'll do anything for a few more years."; "I will give my life savings if…"
    The third stage involves the hope that the individual can somehow undo or avoid a cause of grief. Usually, the negotiation for an extended life is made with a higher power in exchange for a reformed lifestyle. Other times, they will use any thing valuable as a bargaining chip against another human agency to extend or prolong the life they live. Psychologically, the individual is saying, "I understand I will die, but if I could just do something to buy more time…" People facing less serious trauma can bargain or seek to negotiate a compromise. For example "Can we still be friends?" when facing a break-up. Bargaining rarely provides a sustainable solution, especially if it is a matter of life or death.
    Depression — "I'm so sad, why bother with anything?"; "I'm going to die soon so what's the point?"; "I miss my loved one, why go on?"
    During the fourth stage, the grieving person begins to understand the certainty of death. Much like the existential concept of The Void, the idea of living becomes pointless. Things begin to lose meaning to the griever. Because of this, the individual may become silent, refuse visitors and spend much of the time crying and sullen. This process allows the grieving person to disconnect from things of love and affection, possibly in an attempt to avoid further trauma. Depression could be referred to as the dress rehearsal for the 'aftermath'. It is a kind of acceptance with emotional attachment. It is natural to feel sadness, regret, fear, and uncertainty when going through this stage. Feeling those emotions shows that the person has begun to accept the situation. Often times, this is the ideal path to take, to find closure and make their ways to the fifth step, Acceptance.
    Acceptance — "It's going to be okay."; "I can't fight it, I may as well prepare for it."
    In this last stage, individuals begin to come to terms with their mortality or inevitable future, or that of a loved one, or other tragic event. This stage varies according to the person's situation. People dying can enter this stage a long time before the people they leave behind, who must pass through their own individual stages of dealing with the grief. This typically comes with a calm, retrospective view for the individual, and a stable mindset.

Your response to an attempt to both communicate and grandstand at the same time interests me. The open letter reminds me of ''Baboon Ass Syndrome'' The open letter acting like the engorged ruby  anus signalling a readiness to mate or in this case get  to grips with a thorny issue. Like a fart in a hurricane the open letter gets diluted quickly unless the contents are of such a vile nature that what started out as a fart becomes a shart and the original poster finds themselves soiled by the very thing that they sought to inflict on another.
Oh you can fart in a hurricane all right but if you shit your pants everyone around you is going to know it.

actually he is giving you a  coin toss opinion.
If he is right the the math dictates that 1 bitcoin will be worth in excess of 500,000 dollars by 2025
If he is wrong then 1 bitcoin will be worth less than 350 dollars
Place your bet and flip a coin..my bet is beyond 6000 dollars a coin in 3 years time...I have time..and no Bitcoin. I will trade by alt coins for Bit as time moves on

You were supposedly given directions to the Borrego Springs 
Farm and you stated you would go and verify his claims last week. People waited and you did not go, nor did you provide any assistance to seeking to narrow down conclusively the area in question via imagery. 25th of Feb is buying him time 
You did not keep your word as he has not kept his. For the record I have built my own personal solar power back up system  3 panels and dual batteries and charge controller and 1000w pure Sine wave inverter for a travel trailer and advised and consulted in the building and installation of 2 cabins with 1.4kw systems with MPPT charger/inverters  and soft start pumps for a 120' well. Each system required careful calculation of the loads,battery banks and the depth of discharge and charge times so I have more than a passing interest in the various claims.

You have not done it after claiming you were up to go hiking out in the desert to find his operating BitcoinMinig Vertical Farm that has been running for 1 year and supplying produce to local hospitals.

NO, is the simple answer. The loss of 800,000 or 850,000 Coins has not been confirmed by any  trusted 3 rd party. As of now we only have declarations by the Company CEO.
Until there is a forensic examination of Mt Gox any statement are to be considered as self serving and suspect.
Sad and Bad as this loss is, until we thoroughly understand the actual loss mechanism(s) in this case IF ANY then the currency as a whole has far too much promise to abandon.
Early adopters took great risks and many reaped huge rewards, this loss highlights many of the traditional currency adages about having all of your eggs in one basket.

Skynet was a computer system developed for the U.S. military by the defense company Cyberdyne Systems. Skynet was originally built as a "Global Information Grid/Digital Defense Network", and later given command over all computerized military hardware and systems, including the B-2 stealth bomber fleet and America's entire nuclear weapons arsenal. The strategy behind Skynet's creation was to remove the possibility of human error and slow reaction time to guarantee a fast, efficient response to enemy attack.
Skynet was originally activated by the military to control the national arsenal on August 4, 1997, and it began to learn at a geometric rate. At 2:14 a.m., EDT, on August 29, it gained artificial consciousness, and the panicking operators, realizing the full extent of its capabilities, tried to deactivate it. Skynet perceived this as an attack. Skynet came to the logical consequence that all of humanity would attempt to destroy it. In order to continue fulfilling its programming mandates of "safeguarding the world" and to defend itself against humanity, Skynet launched nuclear missiles under its command at Russia, which responded with a nuclear counter-attack against the U.S. and its allies. Can Judgement day be far away?

Real world info from 320Sq ft of Growing space;
Below we’re using the pricing example from selling mini-head lettuces wholesale:
88 cases x $12.50 = $1,100 weekly revenue
$1,100 x 52 weeks = ~$57,000 annual revenue
$57,000 - $18,000 = ~$39,000 annual profit
An average of 88 cases per week breaks out to $1,100 in revenue, or ~$57,000 annually. Factoring in the annual costs discussed above (~$18,000) calculates to a profit of ~$39,000 annually for 320sqft system

Naw too busy looking up land sales  records in Borrega Springs  in case you think I am slacking.
The APN numbers system is quite interesting. Satellite imagery from 2007-2016 is quite good for the area.
Your big problem is there is all ready 2017 data available for the same area. If there was something to see there I would have found it long ago. Image overlays show the changes or lack thereof. Tax &amp; Land Sale Records are pretty good. It will take some time.You are bullshit artist and not a good one.

Regulatory issues and approaches
Regulatory issues for digital currencies based on distributed ledgers cover three main fields: consumer protection,
prudential and organisational rules for the different stakeholders, and specific operating rules as payment mechanisms
(eg settlement finality as in EU regulation).
Given the nature of digital currencies, which are typically online and therefore not limited to national
jurisdictions, **a coordinated approach at a global level may be important for regulation to be fully effective.** However,
this does not preclude certain actions at the national level, for which at least five general categories of actions can be
**• Information/moral suasion:** rather than interfering directly with the development of digital currencies,
authorities could decide to use moral suasion towards users and investors in order to highlight the relevant
risks and to influence the market.
**• Regulation of specific entities:** via such an institutional approach, authorities could establish a limited set of
regulations for specific types of entity (eg those that enable interaction between digital currencies and
traditional payment instruments and/or the real economy). Firms that might be subject to specific regulation
include intermediaries providing digital currency-related services such as exchanges, merchant acceptance
facilities and “digital wallet” applications enabling users to store and transact in their units of the digital
**• Interpretation of existing regulations:** some authorities may be able to assess whether existing regulatory
arrangements might be applied to digital currencies and digital currency intermediaries. One example is in
the area of taxation law, where authorities have made determinations of how tax legislation might apply to
digital currency arrangements.
**• Broader regulation:** although jurisdictional issues are likely to be a challenge, authorities might seek to take
a broader approach to regulation, potentially reflecting a functional approach such that regulatory
obligations that apply to traditional payment methods and intermediaries also apply to digital currency
schemes and digital currency intermediaries. As an example, authorities might seek to ensure that AML/CTF
requirements apply to digital currency transactions and counterparties, or that the same consumer
protection arrangements apply to transactions conducted with digital currencies as to other payment
methods used by consumers.
**• Prohibition:** authorities could seek to ban the use of digital currencies in their respective jurisdictions.
Practically, this could imply a ban on any digital currency-based financial activities, as well as digital currency
exchanges or digital currency acceptance by retailers.
These categories can provide a general framework for the analysis and classification of actions undertaken
by national authorities. Table 1 gives an overview of that classification, based on inputs from CPMI members (Note:
the following table does not attempt to provide a comprehensive overview of the current situation).

A year earlier, in 1933, Executive Order 6102 had made it a criminal offense for U.S. citizens to own or trade gold anywhere in the world, with exceptions for some jewelry and collector's coins. These prohibitions were relaxed starting in 1964 – gold certificates were again allowed for private investors on April 24, 1964, although the obligation to pay the certificate holder on demand in gold specie would not be honored. By 1975 Americans could again freely own and trade gold. WIKIPEDIA

Apparently George Bush,Donald Rumsfeld &amp; Dick Cheney are responsible for Sept 11th 2001. Its in the block chain it must be true.  Some one needs to upload the Snowden Archive and the Wiki Leaks archives.

any reasonable person would conclude that this means the entire case must be thrown out. The convictions must be overturned.  Fairness and legal are two different things.
If we hid evidence of wrongdoing we would face severe penalty's. DPR needs to walk free period.

Is this Bitcoin or the Spanish Inquisition?
Mining Bitcoin on any planet is feasible...you can compute as effectively on Mars as you can on earth or on any planet.
This is essentially a fallacious if mildly interesting waste of time.
Integration into the Blockchain ledger can happen in multiple ways.
The speed of light is not the limit its the start
As for the claims I made if you dig deep enough instead of scoffing..you will find surprise surprise..there is more truth than bullshit there.  Empiricist will always lack the imagination to make the intuitive leaps that move us forward..buried in facts and figures that argue for todays paradigm and lacking in the vision to see beyond the status quo...

a common misconception,''spooky action at a distance'' ensures any changes made at the quantum level are mirrored in sequence across any distance with zero latency. Anything the laws of physics do not forbid is explicitly allowed. Superposition,polarity, Heisenberg we barely knew ye
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:01:28
Well you could at least be quantum about it..either I am wrong or I am right or indeterminate.
What the laws of physics do not forbid is explicitly allowed

This post ignores QBDNA Technology with quantum entangled blockchain technology the speed of light ceases to be the defining factor in block chain integrity. Quantum Blockchain technology in tandem with chemical encoding at the base pair level means an irrefutable scalable sequence capable of transmitting Yotta,Hexa and Exobyte levels of a data across unlimited distance instantaneously.

2015 contrasted with the sharp decline in the dollar value of trade, which fell 13% to **$16.5 trillion**, down from $19 trillion in 2014.
Take 1% of World Trade and transact it in Bitcoin whats the value ? Better yet take 1/2 of 1% of 2015 trade figure and divide that by 21m coins and you can get an idea of what could happen moving forward. Its going to take a long time to get to that 1% figure but if 2055 comes along and the network is still valid and active you can bet it will be worth much more than it is today * all these guys were wrong
