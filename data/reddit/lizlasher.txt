It's awesome. The screen looks great, the keyboard and trackpad have good resistance, and most importantly, it works (unlike my 2009 Macbook Pro).

I'll research and update! Thanks for the corrections :)

The exchange rate between bitcoin and USD when I posted was about 1 bitcoin is equivalent to $200. That means .1 bitcoin (.10000000 bitcoin) is $20 because 200/10 is 20.
When I say bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places, that's like saying the USD dollar is divisible to 2 decimal places, i.e. $0.01 is 1 cent, and that's the lowest number we transact in typically (although banks use fractions of pennies).

Electrum is a desktop wallet, where as Coinbase is an onine wallet. Both are reputable, so diversifying sounds good to me.
Yes that is an address, but I have no way of telling who it belongs to (and just assume it is yours). On blockchain.info, I see that you have 0 btc (sorry).
With reddit, there is no need to 'link' those accounts (you'll see what I mean). Bitcoin tip bot allows you to send/receive btc to/from your reddit handle. It's easy to use, but a little bit complicated to explain all the nuts and bolts. Go to  to read more about it.
Good luck!

Thanks for all your helpful feedback! I've posted a revised version of Bitcoin 101 that now includes a new section on how the price of bitcoin is determined:

Thanks - I'll look into that!

I'll aim to add that, thanks for the suggestion!

You can buy bitcoins on one of the many exchanges. They will have a wallet for you, after that it's up to you whether you want to keep your wallet on the exchange or manage it yourself.
Example exchanges include bitstamp and coinbase.

I downloaded the coinbase app. I couldn't find a viable way to send or receive bitcoins between cell phones (my husband and I just tried). Do you know how?
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:19:03
Ah, I see - I had to request using a QR code to allow another person to send me bitcoin since he didn't have a coinbase account. Thanks! +$0.10 verify

Now you have more!

Hey 16rjg4 - thanks again for your input! I think I still have a knowledge gap about how change addresses really work. I understand what you wrote and it makes sense; I will try to research further and also consider the best way to distill this idea down. Any help here would be much appreciated :)
Generally, this whole section of the handout was to explain why new addresses are often used for change addresses, and to caveat that from what I've read / heard, once you've sent money from an address, that old address is slightly less secure so best practice means use a new address. But at the same time, you don't really have to worry about this unless you have a paper wallet since most software programs take care of it for you.

Yeah - the analysis was done by volume. For currencies other than USD, Mt Gox still has the highest volume.
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:32:24
Good point! I'll make this distinction more clear in my next revision.
@_date: 2013-10-29 19:12:50
Thanks for the suggestion! I agree this is a better way to explain wallets/addresses. Another clarification I can add then is that a paper wallet is an example of a wallet with only one address. I'll definitely incorporate. Cheers.

If that is the one that is at the top of the search with the orange icon (can't remember the name), then yes, it's reputable. Lots of happy users. That's the one my husband has. As always, be careful.

Bitcoin is such a rabbit hole once you start diving into the technical stuff. I'll google around and learn more before I update to make sure I'm being accurate :)
