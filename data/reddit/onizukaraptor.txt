If the story is true, that means ~75k bitcoin is gone forever? Isn’t that bullish news?

Sounds good in the future. But what happens when the amount I used to be able to buy a car with can now only buy a can of coke by the time I try to spend it?

Some kind of secure Api interaction with exchanges. Would be nice to be able to trade without leaving crypto in exchanges.

If someone wants to censor it wouldn’t it be easy because you can track where it came from? 
Isn’t it less private because its a public ledger? Ie people will know how much money you have in your wallet and where you spend your money.
There are more consumers than merchants and chargebacks exist to protect the consumers from fraud.
Not trying to be a smart ass but really want to know the answer.

Got some ransomware late 2015,  even infected my cloud backups. No idea what bitcoin was but paid the hackers 1.5btc and looked into it. I was amazed at what I found. This would be the future,. 
I started buying more btc and eventually other crypto. Started building rigs and mining eth and others. Sold almost all before crash, been trading and now Im accumulating again. 
Thanks hackers!

Yeah, I was sent a decryption key to get my data back, I’m sure there are others that paid, depends on how important the data is.

He said it right there that his time horizon is 12 years, I think he will be more than fine.
