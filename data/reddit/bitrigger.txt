There's usually an additional 12cm fan or two per machine. Gigabyte's cards have slower fans and need more flow. Asus's have high-revving loud fans, but are mainly enclosed in plastic and harder to cool additionally.
All cards were approx. 10'C hotter before we used AMDOverdriveCtrl to force memory clocks down. Series 6xxx cards can't go lower than GPU clock-100 MHz. At least not without re-flashing BIOS. There's one Gigabyte's 5xxx overclocked to 990/150 and it runs great so far.
And yes, 2 cards/mobo is due to cooling. RIG0 has cards forcibly spread apart a little, for overhead fans to have any effect.
Edit: [updated screenshot]( shows RIG3 overclocked and RIG9 "expecting" (block generated, status "immature", waiting for 120 confirmations).

[Room temperature](
It was above 42.C two days ago, before AMDOverdriveCtrl was used to lower the memory clocks.

Transferred to market accounts as soon as they are generated. And usually sold right away.

It's definitely not very pleasant - selling for a certain amount, waiting two days to receive the money (selling via SEPA - direct transfers within EU) - and watching the price go way up in the meantime.
But hey - 50 coins is still a lot. A block (first this week) was generated just a few minutes ago. It'll do nicely towards returning the investment as soon as possible.

Rigs upload their status to a webserver every minute, which displays them like you see in the browser screenshot, or like [this]( for monitoring via mobile phone.

Let's hope so. This week looks bleak compared to last one. Invested around 6-7k EUR into the equipment+office, got 3k out so far (in 2 weeks).

Solo. Got 5 blocks last week, 0 blocks this week - machines were down because of relocation. The old place couldn't supply enough power, so the fuses kept blowing.

Mostly just custom shell scripting. Using stripped-down Ubuntu 11.04 with poclbm.
