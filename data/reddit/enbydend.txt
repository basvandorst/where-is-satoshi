Coinspot is easy if you don't mind their fees

At the time, Yes.
Now, not so much.

My cousin (15 at the time with no money) asked his dad for $1000 to buy BTC at under $3.
His dad said no.

Depends where in the world you are.
I'm sure you have plenty of options that a quick Google search wo u I'd solve.

Never too late to put in whatever you feel comfortable with every paycheck.
Who knows 1% of your weekly wage could end up being a years salary.
If not, you wouldn't have lost much.
And you would always buy the tops and bottoms.

Did not read your name.
Well played...
Please ignore. =p
@_date: 2018-09-28 05:47:28
Not sure mate.. sorry
@_date: 2018-09-28 05:41:54
No, you cannot do both.
A stop is a trigger for your sell/buy price.
So place the stop slightly higher than your sell price.
Or buy price slightly above the stop.
You've gotta decide which way you want to go.
@_date: 2018-09-28 06:24:42
Oh I see.
Well that would be a bit risky for the exchange with the wild swings we sometimes see.
Why dont you set notifications/alerts for 6500 and 6800. Then watch closely and get ready to buy if it hits your targets.
@_date: 2018-09-28 05:45:02
Did the stop price hit?
@_date: 2018-09-28 05:46:17
Then there is not trigger for the buy/sell price.
@_date: 2018-09-02 11:04:03
Wow. So much stupidity in one post. Thanks for buying at 20k. See you at 50!
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:10:53
Why would anyone exchange for it then?
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:06:29
Seems legit.
Send me your TRIG and then I'll send you whatever you want.
Or you know. Maybe you can use an exchange and do it yourself?
I dunno.

100% I am!
Especially in crypto &amp; especially this meme triangle. 
Why? 
Because everyone thinks they are master traders. The whole crypto sphere was watching this. Once it broke, every single trader was quick to sell. Que big drop. Many, many people on the sidelines waiting, so if it broke up, they all would have piled in for the same reason.

Needs a few more 9s
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:01:52
Since it has broke out below that triangle, its dumped hard. If you read the graphical analysis, you should have sold once we got out of it.
If it had broken up, then you should have bought.
What's so BS?
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:41:06
Yep, I agree, much easier in retrospect. But this meme triangle has existed for weeks/months.
@_date: 2018-07-18 03:20:52
Hahaha
