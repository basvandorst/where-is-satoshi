If he has a bit of land, start planting food and get a cistern for water. Trade stuff for animals you can milk, chickens that lay eggs.
If the wheels come off, and it seems they are, her can live off the free food and eggs for a long time.
Until you can get him the hell out of there.

That's why you have gems. Gold is heavy and noticeable. 
You can sew 100 rubies or diamonds in a coat and no one will even feel them in the pat down.

You have to look at this historically.
All the currencies that have come and gone, but mankind always values gold and gems.
Let's use a  scenario:
You're on a tour in south america and your child gets deadly ill.. You speak no spanish.
How do you communicate at the pay for service clinic that you will give them bitcoin? 
How would they even get near a computer?  However you can reach to your hiding place,
pull out an ounce of gold and it requires NO language, and you get what you need.
I don't see why people insist on positioning bitcoin VS gold.
It should be bitcoin AND gold. It's the strongest combination!
Imagine you are in a situation, you have your bitcoin, some gold, and maybe some gems.
You are way ahead of everyone.
Don't limit yourself.

When there is a disaster, or war etc. Gold is king.
Say there is a huge solar flare and it will take 1-2 years to replace all the destroyed power infrastructure.
Walking around with your wallet full of bitcoin is worthless as there's no internet or electricity.
**So gold will always be king. Not as an investment, but as a protection**
Gold should be seen a a stockpile you have that you don't expect to ever profit from, but is always there to keep you safe.
Bitcoin is a currency that is tied to limited supply and market trading fluctuations and may or may not
make you a profit.
After 9/11 here in the city, all the phones,credit card terminals, atm and banks were not working.
However gold requires none of those and people will always treasure and value gold.

This article doesn't mention the *plethora of firmware chips* out there.
Each manufacturer has their own. So while they may have exploited one controller from one manufacturer, they would have to do this to all other drive makers as well, which is going to be impossible.
There are some drives that cannot have the firmware updated.
"Nohl says he and Lell reached out to a Taiwanese USB device maker,"
This would be Alcor Micro, a controller brand notorious for use in "fake" usb drives. They say 32GB, but are really a 512mb chip with a falsified firmware. The will sometimes be reflashed outdated drives, like 1gb or 2gb drives flashed to be 16gb or more.

Steve is dead and innovation with it.
Apple needs to really up their innovation, like a bendable, roll up ipad with front and back 20MP cameras, 500GB flash storage, and 4K resolution with wireless support for your TV.
What they will do is make more and more mediocre upgrades (like more and more colors for the device). They already added gold color for the Russians and Bling people. Only a matter of time until you get NFL team colors or some bullshit.

People go there to iceskate in the winter, not realizing most of the surrounding buildings are vacant.
Utterly unsustainable, and only a matter of time before tax income

If they can't keep downtown vibrant and full of business, the core of the tree is rotten and it's time to leave before it crashes down.

Both. 
But have some Gold.
If there's a serious world issue like a solar flare, or massive earthquake, volcano. No computers, no internet, no power. Bitcoin is an asset only in the wired/powered world.
Have both, but remember Gold is there for when everything fails.

Silver, by weight and value is not practical as an emergency resource.
You going to lug around kilogram bars of silver?
Platinum is not bad, but most uneducated people can't tell platinum from silver. 
Gold you can cut into or cut in half to show it's not plated. You can snip off pieces, or cut off curls with a knife.

You forget fear.
If you have governments gearing up (and they are) to make bitcoin transactions outside of the corrupt existing banking system a crime.
What average person will use bitcoin outside of the approved legal method if there is a jail sentence for not doing so?
You just watch, and mark my words. They are planning to place chains upon bitcoin, and while it may have no real effect, what it will do is put fear into the users and make them comply to the wishes of government and big banking.
Just watch, it's only a matter of time:
Bitcoins must be bought from authorized outlet
Bitcoin transactions must be declared to tax office
Bitcoin will be regulated by a government appointed body that will make arbitrary rules backed by legal penalties.
Did you really think the banking industry and governments would ignore bitcoin and not enslave it?

If you go to mail a package in the U.S.  and use a prepaid envelope, they won't allow you to drop it off in the drop off bin. Even if it's paid in full, you have to go on line, and hand it to them.
If you use the kiosk in the lobby it's ok (they know who you are)
If you use the online postage it's ok (they know who you are)
Basically if you write it out by hand, using a prepaid they demand you go to the lobby to hand it in. I assume to get you on video .
The data tracking on even mundane items like your mail is real and probably substantial.
I expect if the usps tracks an item, the NSA has a copy of all that data, forever.
That's why they hate untrackable postage.
This is also why I expect the bitcoin exchange on wallstreet to be a shell to create an I.D.
requirement for taxes to track bitcoin. Eventually all no I.D. Bitcoin transactions will be limited by law
to a certain amount under penalty of imprisonment.
