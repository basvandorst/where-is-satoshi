I think "sound" and "bitcoin" dont really go together when talking about stability.

I dont think actual speculators who have enough money to move the market are going to be basing decisions off of CNN newsreports

Until bitcoin stops having having wild value swings (its down nearly 66% from a year ago) its going to be hard for many to take it seriously as a CURRENCY. Currencies need to be a stable store of value. It would be better for bitcoin adoption for it to just sit here in the mid $200's for the next 5 years, than it would be for the value to swing back up.
Few business are going to accept something as currency that has wild variations in value.

If you want bitcoin to actually be what you seem to envision then yes you do. You need it to be a currency that all hands can use, not just those willing to risk savings eradicating price swings

Based on what?  Hope? This isn't just a short term dip, its been a year long glacial push down the mountain of the value in a currency.

If you dont know what that sentence means, and you are (essentially) participating in currency trading, you are definitely under-informed and at a dangerous risk of being hosed. Currency trading, which is what a lot of people are doing by seeing bitcoin as some sort of "investment", is one of the riskier things you can do.

Its a currency. At its heart any currency has to be a store of value, preferably a stable one. If your currency is dramatically losing value, it becomes pointless

Unless 20k was just a pump and dump of an unregulated asset that can easily be price manipulated.

You're saying renting, and gaining no equity for 20 years in order to save up to buy a house outright with cash/bitcoin, is superior to being able to live in that house with a low interest rate mortgage &lt;4% for those 20 years? An interest rate mind you which you can outearn fairly easily when even modest investment choices?

Low interest rate debt which allows you to live in a home at 35 rather than 65 when you've accumulated the full cost of a mortgage has value.
Or even if you HAD the money upfront for a home low interest rate debt at 4% for a mortgage vs investing it at an average of 8%, means you can allow that money you saved from an upfront buyout to compound in growth.

"Invests" in bitcoin. Doesnt know what an ETF is.

Im NOT saying bitcoin is a bubble. But when bubbles happen, just because a lot of people are willing to throw more money in the game doesnt mean it stops being a bubble.

Absolutely not. This is dangerously wrong. The entire model predicts both people have a chance of winning. They can both win and the model is right. The model is invalidated if Team A and B play 1000 times, and instead of Team B winning 160 times (16%), its wins say 450 (45%) times.

What experience would that be?
