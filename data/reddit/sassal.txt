Ethereum isn't using DPoS.

It's like russian roulette with excuses; we never know what they are going to say next!

thanks :)
The replies ive gotten have been "Sorry this went to spam".
So an email to your customer support department goes to spam? I've gotten that excuse twice.

As an Australian myself, and son of a business owner who will be accepting Bitcoin shortly, this is great news! :D
My only gripe was that they were saying 'real money' when referring to AUD when they should be saying 'fiat money' in my opinion.

1. I don't think so. It was a required step. It was used to keep in contact with me to tell me when my account was ready.
2. I'm not sure. It didn't give any information on that. I'm assuming it would be something similar.
Yeh I already have :) He's very excited to learn how Bitcoin works also!

It's been 20 days now and I still haven't got my refund on the ATM I purchased. It's pathetic. Sadly, I knew that it was really risky going into it but I still purchased one. Probably never seeing that money again :(

I deleted it because I know it came across as nonsense. It sounded better in my head haha. I don't have a real reason for trusting them - I guess I just do...

I'm not sure if there is one in Melbourne but i'll keep a look out!

Once the barries of entry (such as buying Bitcoins) are brought down we will see a lot more people purchasing Bitcoins. It is still relatively hard to buy Bitcoins for many people around the world. 
Bitcoin discounts would be a great option for merchants wanting to bolster their sales and avoid credit card or paypal fees as well.
You make a good point but I think if my points are addressed then we will see mainstream adoption pretty quickly.

Why no android update? Why support Apple when they hate cryptocurrency? I don't get this...

I don't think it's that long of a wait. I went and got a coffee with my friends and before we knew it it was ready.

Checkout experience was perfect. I used my iPhone Coinjar app to send the Bitcoin across and the transaction went through instantly! I'm not sure what went wrong with the other redditor :\

That's actually incredibly interesting. I don't know much about biometrics but thanks for doing some research into it. I'm not sure either if the biometric data would be handled securely but I'd hope it would be.

Well they could of at least just said AUD instead of 'real money'. I feel that it takes away from the legitimacy of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-10 15:35:04
Thanks :) That mean's a lot!

Just bought one :) Always love having a seamless experience paying with Bitcoin! Thanks a lot for the discount too! :D
