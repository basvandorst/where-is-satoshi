I'm putting it all on BTC. When moon, no job needed.

Same argument about broken countries as always. Yeah they might need it because their economy is in the toilet and they have no other recourse. But we don't need it in the US, nor do most developed nations.
And even then, I've heard so many stories about scammers and scam exchanges defrauding people more than any corrupt government ever has. Not to mention mobs and gangs robbing and torturing people to get their passwords, and thus entire savings. 
To me, the whole Bitcoin thing has very limited use and appeal, and it's definitely overhyped.

It just jumped another 1.5&amp; Don't miss out!

How do you see the old website?

The Titanic once ran smoothly too, but that doesn't mean it didn't sink.
You can zoom out all you want, but past does not equal future.

 [   Click on 1 Day graph, Look at the jump between 6:50 AM and 7:50 AM.

Listen, I poop 4 times a day, and if you think that’s easy, that it doesn’t take energy and time out of you, you got another thing coming. There’s no reason to distrust. Trust me. Buy and spread the word. You’ll thank me. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 21:49:49
How much did you buy? It was obviously not enough. You need to buy more.

The moon is not buying your bullshit.

Smart investors don’t just look at charts and extrapolate, which is what most bitcoin “technical analysts” are doing it seems. 
Smart investors also look at 1. the reasons behind the changes, 2. the true value of the product, and 3. the trend in the product’s use by the public, etc. 
We can see by now that 1. The reason for the spikes were hype, hence bubble. 2. The true value of the product is pretty much nothing since the average Joe doesn’t need it as a currency, and everyone is using it as speculation. And 3. The general public is not adopting it — I don’t know anyone who makes purchases using bitcoin, when credit cards, pop money, Venmo, etc., already suffice. 
Bitcoin is rapidly becoming a laughing stock; its reputation is now simply that of a gambling tool and a means of manipulation by scammers. Its holders are simply zoom–out delusionals, greater-fool hopefuls, and fanatics. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 12:48:25
About 500. Go buy some now
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:42:26
I just quit my job and cashed out my retirement to put it all in btc. The bull run is starting. I don’t care what anyone says. I’m going to either go big or go broke. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:17:53
Finally, someone with some sense, instead of all the bitcoin fanatics.
I've never had a problem with using credit card or popmoney to buy things. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:25:01
What the fuck. Isn’t that the point of this sub? To encourage everyone to get in and buy bitcoin ??
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:39:08
Just more confirmation that it's simply gambling.
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:12:29
Because free market. People are free to do terrible things.

I lost about 2k so far, but that's only because people are not buying like they're supposed to. Everyone needs to buy.

What does the month have to do with anything? A bull run can happen at any time. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 17:05:05
Why is this unique to crypto? Couldn’t these thugs just torture and extort regular money from people?
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:50:29
BTC is bound to go up to 50k. Buy now!
@_date: 2018-05-29 00:07:08
Just tell your friend to zoom out
@_date: 2018-05-30 14:32:37
Bitcoin is alive as long as everyone believes it is. 
Stop wondering and buy so that we can all go to the moon. Tell your friends to buy too. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:24:06
I DON’T WANT TO BE A FUCKING BANK!! I’m not some paranoid schizophrenic. I keep my money in a bank instead of under my mattress for a reason. I want interest returns, I want fraud protection, I want portfolio management services. I want credit cards, shop-safe cards, debit cards, free checks, and a plethora of other options and services that banks offer. 
I can buy whatever I want. My bank is nice as fuck to me. If they weren’t, I’d go somewhere else. But I’m not going to go reinvent the wheel and be my own bank, that makes no sense. 
Societies created banks and people used them since ancient times for a reason. Why are we trying to roll back to the stone age out of paranoia?

A classic version of the Greater Fool scam. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 17:06:30
I don’t understand the difference. With regular money, someone can still put a gun to my head and demand that I wire money to them right?
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:09:40
How is babby formed?
@_date: 2018-05-28 12:04:30
To scam people with hype?
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:50:36
This sub would be dead without the lambo seeking price watchers. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 02:11:28
No, it shouldn't be going down because everyone should be buying. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 11:43:57
Who gives a fuck about the technology. I’m here for the lambos. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:17:44
Fucking what? Do you guys actually take this seriously?
@_date: 2018-04-25 04:56:34
Wtf. This is right? How are you getting away with anti-bitcoin comment and not getting banned?
@_date: 2018-04-08 04:03:15


Using btc is more costly than using fiat. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:44:31
I too used to think all regulation was bad. And then I got some common sense.

@_date: 2018-04-08 04:02:02
You're making too much sense. We frown upon that around here.
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:54:37
Not complaining. Just making observations. I feel bad for people who lose money on btc. Could be going to better uses.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:43:24
Manipulation. It’s called pump n dump.

Some people just don't care I guess. Glad I could help. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:40:19
This is incorrect. We all know that if you HODL, the price will go up.
It is written in the BTC commandments. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:47:16
Just beware because this looks like a pump, which will be followed by a dump. If you don’t sell before the dump, you’ve basically given money to the manipulators. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 03:21:17
Fuck this gay Earth.

Someone would have to live under a rock to not know what bitcoin is by now.
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:08:37
Nope, I wipe from back to front, all the way to the tip of my cock. Want to get it all. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:29:34
More volatile and farrrrr less useful other money.

Are you a wikipedia contributor?

Manipulators are blatantly raw dogging the unsuspected now.

So moneyness can be a good or bad thing?
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:42:44
I’m not saying they know exactly what it is of course. That’s part of its UX problem; you really need a C.S. background to fully understand it, which is just another barrier to its adoption. 
People know it now as that new gambling fad that makes you lose money.
