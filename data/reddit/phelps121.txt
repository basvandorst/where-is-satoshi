I’d like to know 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:14:27
Anything you can afford
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:24:58
Profit is profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:48:44
That would be ideal, but as a business I think fear would stop them doing this. Imagine holding 100 million in bitcoin and it suddenly drops 50%. Numbers like that would shake a company 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:18:25
Alt coins are always more of a risk. Hence why it seems attractive. 
Your money your gains/lose 
You will naturally make a decision if you trust a coin or not. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:14:58
Doesn’t matter how much you put in, you will get the same % gain 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:07:54
Lol, thank you and are you holding any LTC 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:26:56
Private key 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:47:48
Nice,you should pass it forward 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:24:42
Think the file you need to find is wallet.bit I think 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:01:42
Really? Best exchange for supporting the forks? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:28:26
Don’t be an ignorant nob. People will keep asking these questions. People may worry, people may just be curious. 
Don’t push the newbies away from bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:58:56
But surely it’s becoming to the point where it’s not worth investing 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:24:03
To much money invested now to drop to a penny 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:44:46
I pray for you. That you left a few BTC in there. If so enjoy 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:36:44
I would fight for the bitcoin. Good gains made 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:42:23
I’m in LTC and that’s starting to pump so no lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:19:58
In all honest. I’ve invested into Alt coins. On bitcoin if you invest now, you need it to hit 25k to double your investment. 
On a $1 dollar coin. $2 is same gains 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:22:17
I owned half a BTC just over a month ago, spent it. I can now see I made the right choice :))))))))
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:38:47
Wouldn’t amazon and Walmart push the price down. For example, the public spend 6 million on amazon using bitcoin. Amazon now need to sell that bitcoin back into the market and if done in 1 dump. 
6 million was a guess. It could be a lot more 
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:43:41
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:41:18
Please send me photos , I missed the rocket 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:47:00
Keep this thread updated please I would love to know the result 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:40:24
It won’t get last 20k just yet, people will cash out but give it time 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:43:19
Yep , don’t know why people think they will just hand over their profits... just let the winners enjoy
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:31:49
30 mins. Nah you fine.. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:48:13
Crash. Wow 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:40:21
This is painful. Check everything for a private key dude 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:27:21
Litecoin is the solution 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:13:18
Are sales allowed on here? Could sell to another user (uk) bank transfer 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:02:15
You can buy gold using bitcoin. Buy shit Ton of gold and sell it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:27:56
I’m sorry but 100k is your opinion. X5 investment is great but it will take HARD work to hit 100k
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:00:22
Paper wallet If your smart enough to not lose it 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:00:48
Mine is instant . UK 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:31:37
Enjoy lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:16:18
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:05:50
I spent 6k on a iPhone 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:56:24
If I’m understanding it correctly then the transfer delay may cause issues 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:28:48
Would need huuuuuggggeeeee amount of money to do this. If someone has that much money, they already found a way to fill their bank 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:52:08
Them poor customers who have lost loads of money from a employee who downloaded something with a virus. This could ruin some people
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:23:00
Scam or anything ? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:06:25
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:14:38
What was the ROI?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:03:21
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:39:44
Well is holding it’s price very well above 11k, which gains good support, everyone who was waiting for a dip decide to buy in 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:17:51
You lucky sod
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:19:38
I agree,  banks see Crypto as a rival, countries hate it to. Money is leaving countries due to crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:24:55
Have a look at WTC (Walton coin)
Seems like a good chance to get in early.
Good team , good model 
I’m 70% in
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:52:37
 That will be a pain to resolve, wait a few hours I’m sure BTC will go up another 1k lol that will
cover the fee 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:20:43
God the news is always talking bad about Crypto, 
Just accept it!!
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:29:39
Pretty sure mine took less then a day 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:32:21
Fair enough 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:43:42
Not enough money, please look into it. There is so much more money literally everywhere you look. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:21:21
Bitcoin is seen more as a way to store value. Alt coins are good for normal payments and movement of money. 
That’s why bitcoin is compared to gold 
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:44:46
Yeah it is legit? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:22:01
Give me that 0.6 lol 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:35:54
Bitcoin will never go to zero. If bitcoin EVER drops to such a low price. I will sell everything I have to buy as much as I can.. no doubt it would another cycle 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:05:51
Also enjoy it, that strength to hold all the from 2011 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:07:37
Sorry to sound rude. Are you trying to transfer a large sum of BTC? Could be the reason of the high fee ? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:41:47
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:32:43
Or they will use LTC 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:45:15
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:00:31
Ltc 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:27:24
Coinbase seems ok just high on fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:40:58
You forgot your password haha 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:30:59
Bitstamp don’t seem to have any for sale, I looked the other day 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:39:01
It’s just 2 bucks dude. Move on
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:34:36
Localbitcoin and sell for gift cards or whatever you fancie 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:10:42
Coinbase for ease 
@_date: 2018-03-18 23:06:25
What’s your private key so I can confirm this claim?........       I’m joking never send your Private key 
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:24:13
I wouldn’t risk cash.  But a bank transfer is a lot safer 
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:41:40
What is this 
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:29:01
Try to speak with LB then selves , I’m sure they have a procedure for this 
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:01:11
But each time you need fiat for food or rent, you need to pay a withdrawal fee :( 
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:50:45
Made my day 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:08:49
That’s not right, only thing you can do from
Hear is move on, learn from this and don’t accept gift cards for large amounts.. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:47:30
That guy is not thinking very big, you can same for the Internet, there’s an insane amount of websites that do the same job, but some are clearly better. 
The better ones grow and expand, 
The crap ones die off
This will happen with crypto 
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:36:34
Always about money. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:50:13
It’s only seen like this because we are still in a very early stage. Of course the price can spike and drop like crazy but sure it will.. but one day maybe one day I’m sure I will find that remote control I lost for my tv 
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:23:49
The next boom is coming, all theses posts I’m seeing I can sense it in my hairs �� it’s coming
