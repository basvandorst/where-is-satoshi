I've been using their service for the past year I think and I've never had any hiccups whatsoever. Extremely pleased.

**Registration and Name check**
* According to the laws in Korea, Korbit requires individual information during the registration.
* In order to join the member, email is necessary, and after the registration, e-mail verification is necessary.
* Name check is not mandatory. However, without the name check, only bitcoin wallet service can be used.
* In order to trade in Korbit exchange, during or after the registration, name check process needs to be completed. The name check method is cell phone authentication method. Mobile phone in Korea is necessary for this process.
* If you don't have a cell phone under your name, please register without the name check first, and send us the passport copy, bank book copy, cell phone number and registered e-mail address to {member_email}.
* Members under 19 years old can only use Korbit wallet service.
This is from their site, so I guess there's nothing inherent in their service that stops foreigners from using their service.

I've also been pondering on the possibility of somehow combining block chain technology with manufacturing but haven't been able to really delve into the details yet with my limited knowledge and skill set. I've got alot of extracurricular studying to do! Your post was quite interesting!
Also, with the advent of decentralized autonomous corporations, IoT, and AI, humanity seems to be in for some pretty strange ride. I'm betting the near future will be so much weirder than we anticipated.
