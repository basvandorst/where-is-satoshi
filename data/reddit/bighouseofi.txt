I'd like to give an example of something I experienced recently.  I hope it relates on some level.  I had an issue with an item on Amazon  and felt the need to speak to someone.  On the contacts list, there is a button that says, "do you want us to call you".  Click the button and lo and behold, within 2 minutes, the phone rings.  I answer and it is Amazon customer support to help me.  Now, I am just assuming that Amazon is significantly larger than Coinbase with myriad more issues.  Human contact has is and always will be important in growing a business model.  It creates loyalty. It will make you rich(er).

i have accounts at coinbase, circle, xapo, and have a trezor.  Let us look back with nostalgia when you could call coinbase and actually talk to a person.  then, lets think fondly how they had a chat function.  those days long gone.  it is great when you don't have any issues.  the moment you have an issue, it's not good.  unfortunately, it involves your money, which of course ramps up the stress ten fold.  i don't believe they are doing anything purposely to mess with people, but the net effect is instant paranoia.  been there done that.  hang in there.  be a patient pit bull.  I wish i had better advice, but the less hands the better.

Took a solid five days.  I contacted their customer support during this hand wringing phase and they responded by email quickly.  It was all fine but not for me.  Do use a cashiers check which means only the recipient can cash.  Its not much but its something.

My scam antenna is up.  Anybody verify or deny this?  Seems like a great way to lose bitcoin
@_date: 2016-04-23 13:14:43
I have a xapo account.  It is honest with a caveat.  You have to send them a check to fund bitcoin.  It made me very nervous and i was sure i was about to get ripped off.  But all was well.  Nonetheless, i transferred all offline.  I also have coinbase, circle.  You dont need to cancel your accounts.  Just transfer out.  Like many here,  i agree with the peace of mind you get keeping the vast majority of bitcoins offline.
@_date: 2016-04-26 00:33:29
Another attempt to steal bitcoins.  Dumbest scam ever.

Just reread my post. Bought bitcoin via coinbase. Its early here.

I know its simplistic. But this is still cheap for many.

I dont recall borat giving away bitcoin thongs.
@_date: 2014-06-25 02:48:46
I suddenly envisioned a whole lot of things that could be blockchain dependent without necessarily being bitcoin dependent. Voting. Skocial media. Email. Just to name a few. It excited and disconcerted me.

No Hector.  Anybody who invests realizes risk is  the ying to the yang of reward. You weigh your tolerance and make your choice. Making assumptions about who would or would not do something is exactly like making assumptions on a person who goes by the name Hector.  See what i mean?

Wild and wacky water bottles.  I was thinking more in the line of bitcoin thongs, like the ones i will be wearing.

Nice job.  I think the one question that needed to be queried, was if you are a man or woman.  I think the ecosystem is overwhelmingly male and we need some hot nerds who can mine coin and show some ass.  At least I would like that.

I am at btc chicago and saw the film last nite.  It was professionally done but to me i couldnt tell who the audience is meant to be.  For anyone familiar with bitcoin nothing new.  For those unfamiliar, maybe somewhat draggy and there was a glaring omission of even a footnote about mt. Gox fall.  Its hard because the btc story is fluid and everything is old the minute it happens.
@_date: 2014-07-22 03:29:07
Oh Hector.

Shipping personally is the whole point of going. Nonetheless most people are saying that mining 2 terrahash with these machines is a losing proposition. Thoughts?

bryce, where are you getting the 2000.00 figure from?  
@_date: 2014-06-25 02:24:18
Yes exactly. But a blockchain exists without a bitcoin
@_date: 2014-07-23 23:35:37
We all know that the one weakness to bitcoin success is people.
@_date: 2014-07-13 17:41:43
Its meant to be uncomfortable.  And of course disingenuous.  Now quit with the criticism and help me flesh this out.
@_date: 2017-02-17 21:43:51
I concur here. i use coinbase but god forbid you have a problem.  If u do, post on reddit as they respond in a timely fashion here.  That should tell you something.  Keep the large portion of your btc in cold storage and no matter what happens you will be ok.
@_date: 2014-06-21 14:55:56
let me tell you, i have been shown piles of gold before and been taken.  will definitely personally ship if they are real.  I'll probably wind up getting pistol whipped and kidnapped.
@_date: 2017-02-17 21:47:55
Regardless of fakery, getting a coinbase rep to patiently help you aint gonna happen.  When your money is involved it is stressful.  Also, imagine with the china stoppage how much coinbase is growing.   No matter what anyone thinks they are poised to be the worlds bitcoin "bank"
@_date: 2016-06-03 16:41:18
You pay yourself interest by buying more bitcoin.  You are the CEO of your own bank.  Its all you.  I know its hard to fathom. No big brother offering you services in the bitcoin world.  There are a lot of people who like that thought.
@_date: 2016-06-03 16:25:12
I have a coinbase account, circle, xapo and a trezor.  At some point, with any service, you are bound to have a glitch.  Even though most are resolved without incident, when your money is involved, the stress level is through the roof.  Do yourself a favor and get a trezor. Regularly transfer coins to yourself.  Once you realize that one of the great things about bitcoin is that you are your own bank, a lightbulb will blink on.  Remember, coinbase, and all the others do not pay interest. They do not offer loan services or anything a traditional bank offers except for an easy way to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-04 01:16:00
Not to mention, where once you could speak to coinbase customer service, now it is difficult to get a response via email.  I have seen more than twice when an individual places their issue here, someone from coinbase actually responds.  They process millions in bitcoin transactions and make money on the buy and sell. They are very large.  They are not a bank.  Buy a trezor.  Transfer bitcoins to yourself.  Use mycelium to interface with your trezor if you ever wish to buy something.  Keep your bitcoins with you.
@_date: 2016-06-14 12:20:17
I have used xapo, and had an issue.  I went through the app and sent an email.  They were very prompt in responding.  I will say that customer support is the main downfall in exchanges like xapo, coinbase, circle et al.  When your money is involved it is very stressful waiting for and email, tweet or response through reddit.
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:24:27
So correct me if i am wrong.  Coinbase has effectively gone from charging 1 percent on buy and sell to 3.75 on buy and sell.  they have lowered instant buy to 50 bucks.  (From 1000 for me yesterday) Yesterday a 20 dollar buy took an 11 cent fee.  Today it is 65 cents.  The only way around this if you use coinbase is to transfer money to your usd wallet (if in us), transfer the money to gdax and buy on exchange. Of course it take 3 days for transfer to hit the wallet.  Coinbase twisting the knife just a small twist.  Shhhh shhhh.  Go to sleep.

Gonna be vague on purpose here.  Was in Europe in April on a trip for high earners from retirement investment companies.  I own a small audio visual company and was providing some ancillary services.  I can't tell you how hard it was for me to hold my tongue when they were talking about 10 percent gains per year, and I was sitting there watching 300 percent gains in a few months between owning coin and GBTC.  I said nothing, but I believe me I felt a sense of satisfaction as i visualized a chart exactly like this one in my head.  
@_date: 2016-12-17 15:20:45
with all due respect, asking what the point of bitcoin is just doesn't matter anymore.  It just "is".  Questioning is futile.  Whether one finds a reason for it's use or disuse, the fact is clear, it "is".
@_date: 2016-12-23 13:53:17
Its still a portfolio.  Pretty sure i cannot go to betterment with 50 dollars and tell them all i want is 50 of google.  It

i am not looking to buy/sell, but it's all over eBay and I was wondering if anyone has done either with success.  To me it seems an obvious fail, but i figure with so many listings someone must be doing it and i wanted to know their experience.  That's what I mean by facts.
