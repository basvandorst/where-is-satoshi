Noone is using bitsquare either.. have you even traded on it yourself? I realize that it will get better if more people use it, but I wouldn't use it myself at this time nor recommend it as a practical solution to anyone.. basically only use it if you want to experiment.

It probably isn't a worthwhile way to buy BTC but it will probably "work". The fees will be bad and I imagine they may ask for ID - there are probably better services out there.. even 247exchange.com although the fees are bad is likely a better route and they take CC directly.

Yea.. that's the thing.. the only way you can be sure is to try it and see.. maybe even shop around for other bank accounts.. for instance you open an account at a bank that is a direct correspondent of the destination bank it may avoid some of the fees. In general I think larger banks may be better for this... since they may have a larger correspondent network.. but that may not always be true either.

Most likely you can send a SWIFT transfer from your existing bank account.. it might require going into a branch if your online banking doesn't support it, but it's a standard banking service that surely is available everywhere.
Say it costs the equivalent of $50 to send a SWIFT to bitstamp or kraken.. that's a lot of money, but if you send $5000 in one transfer, it's only 1% of the value.. so effectively you're able to buy BTC for around 1% in fees.
If you don't have $5000 of value to send at once, maybe try selling BTC on localbitcoins (in order to get more fiat to send by SWIFT to re-buy the BTC) - or try to find some friends in a similar predicament and pool your resources.
btw.. I would not recommend sending $5000 until you've made sure that you're doing the process correctly and that it works.
For smaller amounts localbitcoins.com may not be a bad place to buy either.. look for any cash deposit to the seller's bank account options.. those are usually the most efficient (meeting up physically for a cash exchange takes people's time which you are paying for.. and any gift card type deals are always extremely inefficient).. sometimes you find cash deposit offers for 5% over the market.

I don't really know.. but I guess you could create a smart contract system on it to transfer value backed by yourself between you and your friends. So in that way it's permission-less.. but if you want to tie into any of the other contracts on the blockchain you probably need some kind of permission from whoever controls those.. unless they are open to anonymous/unpermissioned parties participating.. which they could be.. but probably a lot wont be.

probably none of the above.. maybe over-leveraged longs somewhere.
