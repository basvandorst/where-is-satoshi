Crypto Compare is one of my favorites.

Wow, that's really shitty man. Just goes to show you that you should never trust anyone on the internet. This will be an expensive lesson learned for you. I hope that asshole [will realize this is fucked and return the BTC. If not, I hope karma hits him hard.

I wouldn't say I'm rich (I consider "Rich" several million dollars) but I've made a large amount of money online. I just recently got into bitcoin when it was around 4k so I've made a nice return. I'm pretty young (under 25) and initially bought some stupid shit when I started making money (ex. sports car, designer clothes, etc.) but honestly having a lot of money doesn't really feel like anything. It's nice not to worry about money, but I feel like a lot of people think if they had a lot of money their life would be so different, but that's not the reality (in my experience anyway).

One whole bitcoin? Well I find that kind of hard to believe given your age, but if this is true then you learned an important and expensive lesson early on. Day trading is more than likely going to hurt you rather than benefit. I guarantee you won't make this mistake again.

This dude is a complete cunt. He scammed [out of 0.1 BTC last week. I'm glad you didn't go through with this, as you would of certainly lost your money.

At $50,000 I would probably take out my initial investment, but definitely wouldn't sell it all. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:43:02
A lot of newbies who bought at ATH are freaking out right now. I went all in at 5k and haven't bought since, I think I'll sleep fine tonight! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:46:50
I went all in at 5k and haven't bought any since, but if the price were to fall to 5-7k I will be definitely buying more.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:52:37
I understand why someone would view it this way, but for me when I bought in I had the intention of holding for a few years. It's only been two months since we were at 5k. Who knows where we could be at two years from now. HODL!

For computer - GDAX // for mobile (if you have iOS) I’d recommend the “HODL” app. Has many coins listed and you can choose what exchange you’d like listed for current price

I think $100 is a good amount to invest right now to test the waters, with such a small amount there isn't much risk involved.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:03
HODL! Until you sell at a loss, you haven't lost anything yet. I believe we will be back at 19k soon. There is just a lot of hype surrounding bcash at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:56
No time for 18k memes! It's at 19k baby!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:45:45
I remember we were all saying a few weeks back that bitcoin would hit 10K by Christmas. The growth has been crazy!

Flash sale, getting ready to stock up!

The rate at which you bought is locked in, doesn't matter what the price does after that. While it might not have worked out for you now, imagine if you bought at a lower price and after the money clears the price is now double. It wouldn't make sense for it to now charge you the current rate when you bought previously. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:19:29
Wow, my experience was quite the opposite. I told my dad about bitcoin a few months back, he had heard of it before but didn’t know what it was. Now that I’ve invested and made a little money, he’s always texting me the current price (as if I don’t check it all the time) and telling me that I should buy more haha. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:00:30
Not something that is recommended but I hope it works in your favor. I just bought an extra .35 btc myself, crazy how .1 is almost worth 1k now! IMO I believe you’ll be just fine in the longterm.

Everyone needs to stop commenting, nothing is beating this guys story. Hopefully that push mower is still kicking!

I wouldn't mind a little flash sale 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:22:14
No one knows. It could dip, or it could keep going up.  If you’re in it for the long haul just buy now. No point in waiting for a dip. The “dip” you’re waiting for could be higher than the current price. I bought at the ATH of $5000 and thought that was way too expensive to see any gains, and here we are at 8.2k. Buy now and HODL. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:48:55
If holding BTC feels unsafe that’s probably a good indication that you’ve invested more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:16:48
You already know the answer, you’re just looking to justify it. BUY &amp; HODL! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:06:20
High risk, high reward!
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:20:03
If I suddenly had an extra $50k in my account I would throw it all into crypto, 80% BTC 20% alts. That is just me though, I'm not in any kind of debt and have a well paying job so I'd just invest it all.
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:11:01
I’m 21 and have similar savings. I bought two. Just make sure if you buy a large amount keep them in hardware wallet. Probably the safest option.
