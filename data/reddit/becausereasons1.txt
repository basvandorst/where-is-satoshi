And this is why Bitcoin's market domination is at an all-time low...and falling
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:35:00
Funny they won't be accepting Bitcoin payment anytime soon

Wealthy early adopters would stand to benefit if they donated coins to developers and bitcoin proponents. Invest in the growth!

People forget that every previous bubble that burst was due to lack of the asset providing enough utility or wealth generation to justify owning it. Bitcoin offers wealth generation and utility that improves synergistically.

I boggles the mind. Not all degrees are created equal

Something doesn't feel right...

Except previous dips weren't based on any inherent faults of bitcoin. This one is Bitcoin's fault

This sub has devolved tremendously. Inversely correlated with the price coincidentally

Should have had pornhub pulled up on your phone as an Easter egg
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:22:34
Don't fucking post the price unless you have something meaningful to add. We all have price alerts. Jesus christ

Not sure I trust this either. Millenials aren't saving money.

Serious question: would wall street legally be allowed to do things to Bitcoin they otherwise can't? That would mean serious market manipulation freedoms
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:58:04
Not true. We use it for illegal stuff plenty

Capitulation ending. Despair in 3....2....
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:58:00
This is fraud

Could be their way of setting up a Bitcoin oligarchy. Get as much BTC into the hands of few before the masses get a chance.

Dan Bilzerian bought "a shitload of bitcoin" and has tweeted his frustration at poliniex about cashing out

Crypto is primarily speculation that a given coin will see widespread adoption on par with a currency such as the dollar, yen, euro. The network and general consensus of approving users is the only backing. It's actually very similar to traditional currency in the sense that it's confidence in the system which gives a fiat dollar value.

Am I the only one that's sitting here like "yeah but the transaction fees...." 
Bitcoin needs to scale or else it will only be used as a store of value against alts

My birthday as well! 
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:55:00
This is the big thing. Bitcoin is so globally known as an emerging asset that it's more likely to reach multi-trillion dollar market cap than not.
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:03:13
This is not a good thing. He exploits currencies/countries for his own gain.
