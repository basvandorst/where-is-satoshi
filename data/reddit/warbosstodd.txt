Awww, you’re adorable. Someone can’t honestly disagree with you, they have to be paid operatives huh? Would it completely kill your turgid 3 inch errection to know I actually have investments in Bitcoin, bitcoin cash, lite coin and Etherium? 
Kinda kills your whole argument there doesn’t it?

Well when you’re out waving it around like this everyone’s gonna see it. 
Nice that you have a little 1 line retort but no real response to me 
1) calling you out for a bullshit claim I’m being paid to have an opinion contrary to yours
2) telling you that I’m invested in crypto currency as well and am calling you out for your shitty and incorrect opinions.

Oh I’m not offended. Your claim is a blatant logical fallacy to try and discredit my opinion since you have no logical or factual basis to argue from. Now that I’ve repeatedly embarrassed you and shown that your mentally incapable of mounting a real argument you’re resorting to a completely unprovable opinion of me because of it. I’m going to guess that poking out from under your Trump bumper sticker is a Ron Paul one you reluctantly covered. 
Either way, good luck to you friend. I have a feeling you’ll need it.

It's also a shitty post.

So rather than worthless fiat scam paper you’re putting all of your funds into online math problems that we don’t know who has the answer key? Whiiiiiiiiiich only has value because a group of people says it does which makes it a fiat currency.

And see, your ego is so fragile that you can't possibly bear to let someone else have the last word. Watch, let's see if you can resist replying just one...more...time.

So OP pretty much embodies the negative stereotypical BTC investor. Rather than addressing the inherent problems with crypto he chooses to lash out (anonymously and quasi-privately) like a cowardly toddler who got caught doing something wrong and blames his siblings. 
Don’t be an OP.

So your qualification for someone being paid to sway opinion is if they have a developed vocabulary and know the definition of a “slur” you used? Wow, you really are weaponized stupidity aren’t you?
