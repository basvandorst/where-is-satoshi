Now we’re talking about exceeding the global money supply. Now if the dollar inflates, that’s not impossible ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Gdax/Coinbase still best. Need more currencies tho.

??? Don’t think so. It’s just clear to me you don’t understand what you’re talking about. This is not manipulation. They’re protecting investors from losing large amounts of money.

We can only hope

I’m not really sure if we’re debating here, but yeah that’s what happens when banks create a bunch of funny money. We end up with a derivatives market 5-100 times all the money in the world

They're not overwhelmed. They're protecting investors until there are more orders on the books. They are operating in post only mode for now, because if they allow market sells right now the volatility will be insane.

Of course not. That’s a whole different ballgame.

Probably just more manipulation by Ver and his bois.
Just kidding, I have no idea the cause but wish you the best of luck.

In a year when Bitcoin is worth &gt;$25k a piece will it be worth compromising your friendship over this silly bet?

Nervous wasn't the correct word - maybe "concerned" would have been more appropriate. I suspected, but didn't know for sure whether the fork would fail. Happened a bit sooner than forecasted by Coinbase.

Move it to an exchange and do a little swing trading. You'll need to recoup the fees too, but could save you from spending more money.
