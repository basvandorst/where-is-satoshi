If you have USD in GDAX you could do it instantly, buy and sell, and repeat. Not sure whether it is tied to your daily limit. Instant orders are charged a fee on GDAX but limit orders are not.

Buy some ethereum on Coinbase, transfer it to Binance and invest in alts. That's what I do.

All centralized parties are prone to be audited by their authorities.

Seriously, is it really a fair answer.

Create a wallet, load btc, generate private keys, share part of it on paper and the other part through email or other channe. That way, nobody can accidentally get hold of it

Once registered and approved on coinbase use their gdax to buy. $0 fee on all limit buy and sells. Also, dont be misled by bch community buy btc and not bcash.

I guess tomorrow they will say Bitcoin is crashing.

Sentiment analysis for my favourite coins? Latest news, twitter mentions, reddit threads, trending news etc. I would like to these statistics so that I can foresee demand. MVP for bitcoin and then eventually for other coins?

In a way price drop is a disguise in blessing. People are not constantly worrying about price and freaking out. Instead the focus is on developing the technology. This is what Bitcoin is about. Think long term.

Not really a rally but whatever.

Have to write an article though.

A very geeky friend told me about it when I was in the college, couldn't buy one until mid 2017. I tried buying some in Oct 2016 but Coinbase messed up so things got delayed.

Nice to see young minds being shaped to be entrepreneurial. Pretty sure you are one to be the thanked for. They will surely be millionaires by the time they graduate college.

TA has to be consumed with a grain of salt. Even the most skilled analysts are wrong sometimes. Read 'The Intelligent Investor' and adopt strategies that will protect your investment. Take decisions and own them.

India hasnt banned crypto trading, there is an embargo by the financial institutions that fall under RBI. What that means is your account can be suspended if you transfer between crypto and fiat accounts. 
I dont know any Indian exchanges where a lot of cryptos are listed but the most popular non Indian ones where you dont have to undego KYC are Binance, KuCoin, Hitbtc, liqui etc.

I waited 6 months for my account to be approved by coinbase, so this is a better alternative.
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:17:05
Yeah, there are very limited options for now. But eventually OTC and P2P services will come up, you may have to wait for that. For now there are very few options to convert to FIAT.

Apparently they are still at it instead of improving their blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:22:25
I still see it as suspended.

This is great!!
