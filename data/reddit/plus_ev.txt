I don't think this guy alone caused the crash.  He just made a profit off of it.

True, but there is still the risk of blockchain.info getting hacked or their owners turning malicious and modifying the javascript that handles your password, enabling the theft of your coins.  To be 100% safe you would need to review the javascript every time before entering your password.

OP got it from MPOE's blog: 
Edit: I misread killerstorm's comment, there appears to be no source on the USD figure.

The source of these numbers is 
Was 200k BTC really lost when TradeHill shut down?  I thought that it was only Dwolla and/or fraudsters scamming 100k USD from TradeHill, and TradeHill ate the losses and fully paid customers.  Occasionally, I even see threads where Jared from TradeHill returns customer funds to customers who initially neglected to file a claim.

Butterfly Labs is selling a 30k box advertised to do 50.4GH/s.  I don't think anyone has received one yet, and they have stopped responding to my email questions.

The market should have already have this priced in.  Despite this, I believe there will be some increase, but certainly no where near doubling.

You are right, I was mistaken.

BFL asic preorders were initially only available through bit-pay using bitcoins and cost $150 - $30k per unit.

Correct, he did not profit overall.  He did profit off of the initial price decrease.

200k BTC (~1M USD at the time) is an extremely high estimate for an incident I have yet to see a single customer unable to eventually recover their funds.  I noticed in the footnote he says it could be as low as 25k BTC, but I still find this estimate high as there is no evidence of losses.

The people who think it isn't a scam would have higher returns just investing in the service instead of betting.

They are probably using libraries that yubico provides which store the keys securely (hashed).

Attempting to circumvent the limits can also raise suspicions.
