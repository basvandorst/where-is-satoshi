That PR segment too, is that a delta wave?
With a bundle branch block that means we're looking at Wolff-Parkinson-White here lads. Expect some crazy arrhythmias (volatility)

TLDR: US pension fund should allocate some high risk investments into Bitcoin to improve the rate of return on their pensions holdings (and thereby hold off a pension crisis in the US)
This is based on the value increase of Bitcoin from 2015-2019 compared to traditional investments
Isn't hindsight great!

I think you put some great detail in this comment and fully agree with you. 
On a side note, I believe Bitcoin and its wallets are still messy and complex for general public use. However there's hope over the next decade that wallets will become more simplified allowing people to step up to cryptocurrencies. This is why I still see Bitcoin in its early stages.

As much as we like to read these articles, we must always be aware of our own cognitive bias and personal desire for bitcoin to prosper. I encourage others to always create arguments in their head that oppose positive bitcoin articles or alternatively subscribe to r/buttcoin for an alternative perspective
Edit: Please understand that I am pro bitcoin, I just don't want people selling all their worldly possessions for more btc. Having a balanced view is key.
