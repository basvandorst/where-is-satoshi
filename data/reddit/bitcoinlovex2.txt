Honestly, I see that both side are fueling fire, not just one side for sure. There are rude and immature people both side for sure. Even some main players in Bitcoin community are not following good manners. I guess that is the reality of Bitcoin ecosystem right now. It is not really professional at all. That is the culture of Bitcoin network. Some positive things are that we don't have much hierarchy, and we can chat with big players easily and casually. That is good things and if we allow open discussions to happen naturally, our conflicts in the community rather resolve very quickly, frankly, logically, and economically.  
The escalation begins when we pick a side and don't allow open discussion publicly. In short time, we think we make peace but actually that will make both side voice even louder and angrier because no place to talk together.
If we really want to see Bitcoin successful, we really need to allow diverse opinions and open discussions. And I think this subreddit is the key. I hope the moderator allow this comment and start allowing diverse opinions and open discussions. Thanks @_date: 2017-04-23 18:12:47
SW allows more transactions. Does it increase the bandwidth for nodes?
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:03:32
Oh sorry, you are right. It is every 2.5 minutes. I thought every one minute. Ethereum has every 15 seconds. Very interesting.  Both coins seem working OK. Why can't Bitcoin adapt shorter block time? Isn't it better than the block size increase?

u/nullc So, SW is basically optimizing technology? Making the data format efficient so more transactions, two to four times, can fit in a same block. So over all bandwidth will theoretically reduce two time to four time when the number of transactions is same comparing to the current system? Do I understand right?

I think we are in the same boat. Not all users need to run full node- we both agree. For some users SPV are more than enough- We both agree. 
Sufficient enough number of full nodes which secure the network should be run all the time- we both agree.
The point of discussion should be what is the sufficient number of full nodes and how much is the cost to run it. What the benefit should be and how kind of incentive we can create if we need to maintain certain number of full node for the security of the network.

I got a lot of small daily payment to my wallet so when I send all these together in one transaction, the size of transaction get bigger and the fee get higher than usual. 
The amount of Bitcoin is not factor of fee but the size of transaction. 
Well, the fee should not be the high, though. I paid a same kind of transaction last month and it was only $2. It got so popular recently but congest Bitcoin network. It means that it is time for Bitcoin to scale up otherwise people will quickly abandon and use something better instead.

@_date: 2017-05-31 16:28:08
It because 80% of industry agree for the compromise. Then you can safely adapt the change. Originally core developed the SW because they don't want the risk of coin split. So BIP148 sounds an oxymoron to me. In this point, it is not "what to improve", but it is matter of "how to implement" SegWit2x.

@_date: 2017-05-17 16:43:02
We wanted to avoid the risk of a coin split via a simple HF scaling, So Devs chose to SWSF wih 95% of miner adaption instead. Now suddenly it is good idea to force SWSF via UASF which can has the risk of a coin split. So why do we need SW in the first place. What is the point?

If we use only on chain, 32 mb is far small for the level of visa txs. Satoshi was talking about 500mb size block size for the visa level txs. But the very important point is that we won't reach the level for many years. It took for 50 years Credit card to reach the level. Maybe Bitcoin reach by decade or  two. Then the network environment will drastically different, much better and cheaper than now. 16 years ago,  when the first time i used internet, it was 56kb/s tell phone modem with the fee of $80/month. Now I can get 1Gb/s with $100/month. We got to think about that. Also there should be more soft ware solutions like side chain, lightning etc. So we should not worry too much.

It is the Dev's fault. Not listening from miners who have power to implement the change, CORE Introduced a controversial proposal with the super high threshold of 95%. Why do they even think it will go through without any problems? They are out of touch of the reality and it is an irresponsible decision making.  Either, if it might come from their sincere devotion of bitcoin or conflict of interests, which some might assume, it is a bad leadership. Then they say bitcoin needs no leader .......

Well, probably only few hundreds or much less people support BIP148, not millions for sure.... Almost no miners support so it means they will split the coin. So it means bye bye to them. I don't know what they want but, If the split is that they want, I don't stop them to go away. After all this is an open source project and any one can folk any time if they want. I think that is after all the best way to resolve the conflict......

@_date: 2017-05-18 12:48:22
It is not same security. Especially the block is full. I like lightning but use cases are rather limited. You have to make a deposit to send money each time you open a payment channel. If we want to avoid that  big companies like coinbase who have to comply the financial regulation will be the payment hubs. But that is very dangerous. My point is no one solution fix all problem of scaling, including LN, SW, sidechain, Onchain scaling.... We should not rely on just one solution.

@_date: 2017-07-08 00:32:16
If you don't give any incentive to run node, of course less people will run nodes.... Even it costs $10K to run one node, but same time if you can make $15K to do so, many people will run nodes. Instead of complaining, designing better system with good incentives is better attitude.....
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:26:54
I agree eventually nodes should be paid and LN is one good thing solution. My point is that we should not relied of only one solution when we have many neutral inclusive solutions on the table. We just need both solutions and make them compete each other. We should not block one or other. 
Even Bitcoin Core deve who is developing LN admits it has limitation. “Even with 1 megabyte blocks, Segregated Witness, and the Lightning Network deployed, Bitcoin will only be able to cater some 14 million users,” Dorier said. 
Don't get me wrong, I am not criticizing the technology but each one has its limitation and we should adapt  solutions as many as possible in order to embrace billions of people on the earth. If we can, all of us here will be much richer than right now.
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:16:23
This is very first Satoshi's response after he published the white paper, answering the critic that Bitcoin network can't scale which also the first response to his white paer.... The scaling debate started in the inception of Bitcoin.

Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.
The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.
If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.

@_date: 2017-05-18 14:07:30
You are brainwashed. We can do both.  Hardware and internet speed are improving every day....  Off chain and on chain need to compete each other for their services. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:21:04
I start understanding SW of not technical code, but its approach.  
It is not a simple upgrade. It is very complex. It is giant code. It includes many features and changes. It has good incentive changes for one / questionable changes for other.
Core has not been able to sell this because the complexity. Bitcoin is very a complex system in the first place. So why it is so easy to explain a even more complex system. 
The complexity creates confusions and questions. No every one can read code, I don't either. So many need to rely on the experts. Even you can read the code, it is only rules of the game. You don't necessary know how the new game will be played. One small detail might affect the game tremendously. We only can assume the part.
The complexity also give spaces to someone to add hidden new incentives. If the new system is more complex, there will be more moving parts. It mean more spaces to hide. So we can't criticize that some people really doubt the intentions and don't believe SW at all even though they can't explain specific problems. 
It reminds me that when Affordable Care Act bill introduced, it has one thousand pages- no body really read before voting. I didn't read it but I certainly knew there were many incentives for insurance companies just because from the length of the page and approach of making the bill.... 
I don't say Bitcoin is corrupted like US politics... Probably x100 more cleaner than that. But I don't deny that after all we are designing a money which is worth a lot and there are many big interests of different businesses. 
When upgrading such system, I think avoiding the complexity is good or must....
As all we know, Bitcoin is not  an easy system to reach consensus in the first place. If the subject change becomes more complex and decision making becomes much much harder.
If we need a big change in the code, it has to be very very simple and something everybody in the ecosystem can understand. There are no other ways for this unless we are ok for coin splits. 
The complexity comes from the design approach. 
The approach is avoiding a contentious HF or coin split. In order to do so, it has to be a SF.
Upgrading any moving systems need tremendous effort and planning. It is just difficult to change anything while it is moving.
Just imagine you are expanding your restaurant. It is not easy doing the construction while you are cooking food same time. Similar analogy, you try to upgrade to putting extra seats on moving car. 
That is the SF. If the change is miner and small, it might be good idea to take the approach. But if the change is massive, it will bring more complexity over benefits. 
Generally speaking, in some point, the owner of the restaurant decide to close the restaurant for days and complete the construction. Or the car owner decide to stop the car and make a change their seats....  
There is a lack of leadership in Bitcoin ecosystem. Many people don't know difference between authority and leadership. 
Well, I still optimistic about the future of the space. Even if there will coin split, I don't think that will kill Bitcoin nor Blockchain. It might be better to have... who know. At least, at the end of day, Bitcoin is a service, like a business. We have customers and competitors. If we can't cooperate together, it is good idea to split. Unlike business, Blockchain allows us to try two different paths easily. Then maybe it is not so bad idea to try both- only time will tell the truth. 
 
That is why I don't necessary disagree UASF-even it is little oxymoron, avoiding HF to might cause HF, nor a simple HF scaling upgrade. In some point, it reaches wasting time to just doing endless debate......
