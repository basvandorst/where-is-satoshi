Thanks, I'm not super into mathematics, but I understand you when you say that this scenario happens every once in a while (3.6% of the times) I just thought that the distribution was less scattered because each time I checked it before it the interval was approximately around 10 minutes between all the blocks.

I totally agree something has to be done about the block size. But if bitcoin is going to turn into the economic singularity it has the potential to be, thorough thought has to be put into how this change is going to be implemented. 
Many big changes or crossroads like this one will happen in the future, what they will be about is impossible to predict. It's really important how the system will tackle these changes. So how bitcoin will change is the big and difficult question. 
The evolution of the system has to work, because it is an ever-changing on-going project. I'm not a developer or economist, but I really believe the survival of bitcoin is dependent on this. I don't know how it will work, and how bitcoin can evolve in the best possible way, but I know one system that does work and that is the one that is all around us. Again it is time for us to look at nature for inspiration :)
All the time we call Bitcoin an ecosystem, and that is a key term. Bitcoin needs both the stability and the flexibility inherent to any natural organism or system of organisms. And it needs to be immersed in the core as well as all applications. 
Maybe it is time to bring in some of the worlds foremost AI-people and system ecologists on this? :)

Thanks! I think I get it, I was just surprised by the big difference in the time intervals, didn't see that before :) Nothing strange going on then I suppose

Okey! I wasn't aware that it could have such a large range though.

There will always be people willing to sell bitcoin, if not the price will go up because of demand, until enough people are willing to sell to meet that demand. Simple market economics
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:24:43
Yes, and it's also sad that alot of BTC-friendly comments resort to the same low-level arguments and smearing. But maybe they too are sock puppets, what do I know. 
I can only do my part and downvote comments I regard as un-constructive and upvote those that I feel actually brings something to the table �� regardless what "side" they're on. Sometimes it's like trudging through horse shit. But atleast it feels like I'm contributing!

Main chain in irish means mooncoin? Good then I know where to place my bets!
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:33:54
Yes, hash rate will move around depending on price and profitability on the two chains. It's a constant striving for balance. Hash rate moving from btc to bch, or hash rate increasing on bch, is insignificant for the price. 
It is however the other way around, increased profitability will cause more hash rate, like for example the recent increase in price of bch. The cause and effect is price -&gt; hash rate, it is not hash rate -&gt; price.
So what is the point you are trying to make?
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:10:29
Great, thanks!

If XT comes out as the main fork, what stops the bitcoin core team from implementing the same changes, and then make their own fork if they want to, just like gavin and Mike are doing now? And let The nodes decide?

There is no end to all these really bad solutions being proposed. It is like they're trying to ruin bitcoin on purpose.. i find it difficult to be willing to comprimise when things like this give me zero confidence with the developers and supporters of BU.

The value of bitcoin is not backed by electricity waste, it's backed by the belief of the users, like any other currency, fiat or crypto. The only thing the electricity "waste" is backing is the proof of work and the blockchains untamperability.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:02:21
Bad advice. Might be poorly regulated now but that will probably be different in the future, even 1 year from now. In my country it's your own responsibility to declare and proove your economic transactions, get caught and you are guilty of evading tax.
However, 100 euro isn't really a big sum of money to worry about though. 10x or 100x that I would be a little more careful about.
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:24:42
I'll burn a bit in the name of Satoshi for you.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:31:55
It's the other way around, the amount of electricity needed is based on what value bitcoin has, you should read up on difficulty adjustment and how that balances the rate of blocks and block rewards. 
Value of bitcoin goes up
 -&gt;
 someone sees profit in building miners and dedicating hash power to mining
 -&gt; 
difficulty adjusts
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:29:46
Yeah that is true but it isn't the only reason though right? The concept of pow is really powerful and innovative but without people believing in it bitcoin is worthless
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:13:31
Of course! The stock market is crashing because people need to sell so they can buy cheap crypto! Bitcoin caused this

A private blockchain is just a shared database.. Whats new here? To me it seems like the banks are just finally responding to the threat of bitcoin by looking at solutions to send money between banks and countries in an easier way. This is nothing new, and could've been done years ago if they just had the incentive. Whats new about the blockchain is its distributed, secure and decentralized nature.

Any reason why it wouldn't actually be possible to have it open forever theoretically?

I think it's genius for PR reasons to call it the public blockchain though.
@_date: 2016-05-31 10:23:05
It's not the same, you are writing it as:
Increased costs for miners -&gt; The market (the selling and buying of bitcoin market?) compensates this by increasing the value of a bitcoin (?)
I don't see a direct correlation between those two.
@_date: 2016-05-14 10:20:07
It was a good talk, but I got fed up when he got to the part where he was talking about not letting other peoples failures getting in your way. You will get quite lonely with that attitude

"There are some beginners in the Bitcoin community confused about why the halving would increase the value of coins. This Satoshi quote sums it up perfectly. As the network power grows, the halving will result in more expensive coins... "
Here you imply that the market price per coin will change.

"The Trust Machine", It's genius!

He's really rude but he means that when there were issues with withdrawing USD but not bitcoin, people with USD on the exchange would scramble to exchange those USD for bitcoins to get their money out, thus causing the price to spike even further.
@_date: 2016-05-31 08:59:27
That quote from SN is either from another context, or he didn't even understand it himself. You got one crucial point backwards:
"As the network power grows, the halving will result in more expensive coins through the natural dynamics of the market to compensate miners for their increased costs. "
There is no natural dynamic to compensate the miners for their increased costs. Instead the dynamic lies with the miners to adapt their operations to the price of bitcoin and the block reward.
50% block reward -&gt; 50% less revenue for miners (fees unaccounted) -&gt; Miners continue to mine at loss, or miners will stop mining until equilibrium is reached, where the network hash rate has decreased with 50%, and the difficulty adjusted accordingly with 50% as well. 
This scenario is with a stable price, and the price of bitcoin might rise because of: 
Fewer newly minted coins -&gt; Decreased marginal supply -&gt; Bitcoin price adjusts accordingly (Supply and demand)
So yes, maybe the price will double, and then the miners can continue mining as usual with the same hash rate because you get half the amount of bitcoins as reward but for double the value, so the revenue stays the same. 
But there is no direct correlation between 
less revenue to the miner -&gt; price adjusts to compensate. 
IMO the halving effect in itself will have less impact then double the price of a bitcoin. But the halving as an event could trigger larger price rises because of the anticipation and the hype, and cause a rally that will sustain and fuel itself for a while bringing new people onboard. In the end a higher price will mostly be because of bitcoins natural growth with more and more adopters and less because of the halving.

@_date: 2016-05-28 18:09:47
I think the truth is a combination of all those factors, and the reason why there is no absolute consensus is because bitcoin was and still is novel in its properties with a short history. 
Also the whole mt. Gox thing seems quite shady. Nevertheless, people were willing to accept those prices as realistic and it looks like we're heading up in that direction again.
