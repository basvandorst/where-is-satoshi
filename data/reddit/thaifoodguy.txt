Another Wall Street scumbag.  
Denied for years that market manipulation in gold &amp; silver trading was happening under his watch until participants came out and admitted they were doing just that.  Even held an "investigation" that found no instance of market manipulation.

Saw the headline, was wondering what Immigration and Customs Enforcement was doing with bitcoin and why they were on Wall Street.  Pleasantly surprised.

I coud see swapping BCH for BTC as 1031 compliant as the code base is very similar.    For BTC to Ether maybe not so much.  
I'd like to see more advice on this issue.  It affects anyone who got rid of their BCash for more BTC which is probably many of us here.

Yes, legally your deposit is an unsecured loan to the bank.  
They would never give YOU an unsecured loan, so why should you give THEM one?

and the rack, wiring and inverter.   At some point the money saved by generated electricity is more than the initial outlay.  After that point, it's "free"
@_date: 2017-02-21 00:26:44
Not OP but I'm looking to put a rack of solar panels in my yard.  I'd be doing most of the work myself.  Once the panels pay back the initial expenditure in electricity savings, the power is essentially free.
@_date: 2017-02-21 01:14:13
Cars and TVs don't generate income, solar panels do.  Under PG&amp;E's net metering program if I generate more power than I use they send me a check, not a bill.  Eventually these checks will amount to more than the cost of the system.  
@_date: 2017-02-21 01:46:58
Mortgage no, but yes property taxes. I'd pay taxes whether the panels are there or not.   The numbers don't lie.  With tax incentives, and cheap panels ($.25/watt) it's in the black after 4.5 years.

Nice!  Congratulations!
I'm sure mine is on the way.  Had dinner at a Chinese place a few nights ago and my fortune cookie said :
"Something on 4 wheels will soon be a fun investment for you."
I've never known a fortune cookie to lie, right?

Here's a chart of opium poppy production acreage in Afghanistan 1994-2015.  Note the lowest production was 2001, the year the Taliban was in control.  Ever since we brought "freedom" to the country, production of opium has been rising.  This is feeding the addiction problem here in the US.  2017 is looking to be the biggest harvest ever.

Filed last week but the money comes out of my account today.  For some reason the bank decided to place an extra hold on a cashiers check i deposited on the 11th and they said they're not releasing the funds until the morning of the 18th.  Who will win, B of A or the IRS?
At least there's no state taxes here.
