To get a good sense of who "created" the Ripple technology, one needs to look no further than Github contributions:

author here: yup, that's her FB group. If you guys are interested in an IAMA with Alakanani, I would be happy to set that up.

Ethereum is trying to build and market their own cryptocurrency along with their smart contracts implementation. That's one reason why it's taking so long.
Codius is a pure smart contracts implementation that can work with any web service including Ethereum. As such, it will be ready much sooner and we'll be able to start playing around with smart contracts interacting with consensus networks like Bitcoin now rather than later.
In terms of cooperation, Vitalik hung out at Ripple Labs for months prior to launching Ethereum. Codius was designed with maximum cooperation in mind and hopefully can help improve and unite the ecosystems of all cryptosystems.
And now it's open source!

I'll tweet from my Twitter account  Motherboard should be shooting out a tweet, too.
Going to set up the thread now and open it up for questions, since I won't be around for the actual AMA unfortunately.

haha, thanks

YES! There's a huge dearth of awesome bitcoin art ;]

DUDE! YOU GUYS ARE SERIOUSLY THE BEST! THANK YOU! I'M RICH!!!

Yup. And ultimately, what bitcoin is for finance, 3D printing is for manufacturing. Both gold confiscation and gun control eventually become obsolete.

Kind sir, you are far too generous. I cannot thank you enough. Now to figure out these bot shenanigans...

Hey patrikr, I understand your point and it's unfortunate that we didn't credit ngzhang or any of the other co-founders for that matter, but this was about the Avalon project as a whole and the specifics of production never came up (as we were focused on the big picture). I'll make sure to give ngzhang his proper due in the future. Apologies if you were offended.

Author here: I'm not endorsing tax evasion or any kind of criminal activity. What Apple is doing is perfectly legal. The uber wealthy use similar strategies to minimize their tax bill. That's the overarching trend as multinational companies become global citizens. I'm just wondering when average people get to hop on the bandwagon. Right now it's about resources, but will bitcoin help close that gap?
@_date: 2013-03-26 19:03:51
Are we really arguing over whether Wozniak or Jobs created Apple?

We do!

Author here. Excellent point, especially in light of that whole fiasco in Cyprus. How the government reacts is definitely the big wildcard here, although you'd have to think they'd have a much harder time trying to confiscate bitcoins.

Thanks mariodraghi, you're too kind. Indeed, we're working on a longish form video documentary, but at this point, "soon" might be wildly subjective. Stay tuned.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:14:46
Yeah, it's promising stuff. I'll have a more comprehensive interview/regulations piece ready in a few days. Stay tuned.

All of the Avalon founders created their ASIC miner. I figured that was understood.
