Soooo. I sent some bitcoin a few days ago to bittrex and it's still unconfirmed in my wallet. It appeared in bittrex wallet as an unconfirmed deposit then it disappeared today. Will it return to my wallet?

It's football m8, nothing every happens until someone gets twatted in the face with the ball.

I thought it was a good listen. Good job for sharing it

It's happening

This is my first. I started buying around January. Around the 800-900 dollar range. I made a bit of money trading alts. Lost some as well.
 Learnt some shit. Then it all went down hill as we all now and I've been holding ever since. I'm probably down 50% of my initial buy in. But it's been fun.

Maybe batman. The hero we deserve. But not the one we need.

I've never really understood the whole. It's used to buy drugs thing. I'm pretty sure you can buy drugs with US dollars as well. 
Maybe we should just ban currency all together.

That makes sense. Thanks for your input.
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:49:17
Thank you for a decent reply. This is in no means a head in the cloud kind of thing for me. I did a fair bit of reading this past week and this is just a thing on the side that might turn out ok.
Thanks again

Did it ruin your day that much? Get off reddit and go outside

Obviously some people don't have a sense of humour on this sub. It's pulp fiction for christ sake, that shits always funny
@_date: 2014-05-01 06:30:03
What does it mean?
... Sell
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:24:40
Pretty cool. Good job.

Good job on finding such a thing. From a health point of view. Why do you take part in a 'sport' that is riddled with injuries. Like seriously. Kipping pull ups...

From your post history it seems you're a throwaway copy pasta. No thanks

Yeahhhhh. As much as I enjoy a good old fashioned hand cutter offerunio. We're civilised. If indeed Karpeles has commit a crime then hopefully justice will prevail and he'll be tried for those crimes. 
Shit happens my friends.

I don't know how easy it would be to talk Saab round to accepting bitcoin

Both? ��

Well. If you’re prepared to lose 401k... because that’s effectively what could happen obviously. Make sure you make the decision for yourself as you say it’s your 401K. 
Maybe play with like 10k or something? I wouldn’t risk your entire capital unless you’re in a position that you can live without it.
