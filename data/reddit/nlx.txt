Can anyone with experience tell me what the financial effeciency would be of investing in a  in current conditions?
It costs 4125 euro (0.355 BTC / USD 5126) and it states:
Ethash 181.2 Mh/s Groestl 111 Mh/s X11Gost 41.4 Mh/s CryptoNight 4140 Mh/s Equihash 1740 h/s Lyra2REv2 34200 kh/s NeoScrypt 3900 kh/s LBRY 810 Mh/s Blake (2b) 5940 Mh/s Blake (14r) 8100 Mh/s Pascal 4140 Mh/s Skunkhash 111 Mh/s
Anyone got any ballpark figure clue as to how much time before it mines 1 BTC ( or any other well known coin )? I’m not calculating the price of electricity yet.
And how does this actually work? Do I need to mine a complete coin before I can see any profits? Or can I just lend off my computing power to some bigger farm that pays me partial coins?

I always use Litecoin to transfer money from/to Gdax. Kraken needs 12 confirms for LTC (approx 30 min.) but Gdax only half that!

Why the hell do people expect that “being 16” or “being a girl” deserves them a place in the spotlight? If anything, being 16 means you are still learning, and you might make big (easy to spot) mistakes that can cause bugs costing the user a lot of money. And bragging about being a girl is the exact opposite of equal opportunities expectations. Both have zero to do with what we should expect from the app, yet it is the first thing that gets mentioned, even before the nature of the app is even conveyed.
If this is the way you’re planning your marketing, I’m not even looking at your app.

My rant isn't directed at OP. Not only does OP state to *not* to be 16; OP also doesn't tell us if (s)he's a boy/girl.
Still, I chose to rant on this topic, because the original 16-year-old-I've-written-an-app-girl-topic already had over 600 comments.

Quit it with the stupid FUD title that is supposedly telling good news, while actually it has a FUD message in it, for it implies The Netherlands is/was considering banning crypto.
But in fact: the Dutch Financial Authorities (Not the Dutch Central Bank) is considering banning DERIVATIVES on crypto as well as other online high risk investment products, such as binary options. As a side note they mentioned that banning the crypto themselves is isn’t doable as it isn’t even an ‘investment product’, but they didn’t even say they were considering that at all.

What I'm trying to do? Well, will it for example be possible to do something like this:
- Let's say the current price is 5000 and I have some bitcoins that I expect to go up in price
- If price rises to 5500, trigger a SELL limit order to protect me in case the price starts dropping again
- The limit order should fill once the price drops back to 5250.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:48:57
How true is this? Meaning how many people, how much delay and since when?
For me no problems two weeks ago:
- issued a 250 euro withdrawal on December 13, and it arrived two days later.
- And did withdrawal first of over 0.1 Litecoin and later on the same day of over 1.0 Litecoin on December 16, and both completed within 30 minutes. Both were later deposited back as well, and at quicker pace even because Gdax needed less network confirmations in regards to the exchange that I first withdrew to.

You say "Buy stop only on higher than market price", but what if I still buy stop on a lower than market price, as that seems possible at least in sandbox. What will happen? And what if the accompanying limit price is filled in on a higher or lower value than the stop price? Can you please answer my more specific example questions that I added to my post above?

I dont exactly know. I'm new to this game. But looking at coinmarketcap, that was what I noticed.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:01:14
I should have been more clear with my question. I'm not asking why there is any difference at all. I'm asking how this difference can be so huge! But I think I have figured out an answer myself. Most exchanges listing over $10k are not listing it on a $ pair, but on other fiats like KRW. Only the smaller exchanges list over $10k on BTC-USD. So it's not a fair comparison, as BTC for Zimbabwe fiat is already passed $17k.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:28:54
Can anyone please explain the technicalities of how other exchanges have passed the $10k mark by far (some almost at $11k) , while GDAX is still listing under the $10k mark ?! I just don't understand.
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:06:57
Sure we will swing back. But I've still to see "higher", because we still haven't been back higher than the high before the crash of December ($20k). Nor higher than before the crash in January ($17k). Nor have be swung back higher than before the crash in February ($13k).
And each time the crash bottoms are deeper and deeper. Januari ($10k), Februari ($9k), March ($6k).
So now will we easily recover to before "March's crash" ($12k) ? I think it will depend on whether this crash will again go lower than the previous crash of $6k.
Right now I'm all in since two days ago, thinking I had bought the dip. So I'm hoping won't bend and sell...

I don't have to read the document where all the gold diggers that make unsubstantiated claims towards the bankruptcy have been included whilst they still needed to be confirmed.
The ENTIRE marketcap was around $10B, including wallets and other exchanges. And only $650k was lost, being around $0,5B. It's just impossible that back then Mt Gox lost $25B of other people's money. Even including fiat. Because that would mean 49 time more money would have been lost, compared to what was stolen.

The entire Bitcoin market cap was nowhere near $25B when Mt Gox went belly up. So what are you talking about?
The highest Bitcoin did until then was around $14B including all exchanges and wallets, where one coin was worth approximately $1155. Just before the hack went public, the market cap was $10B and one coin was worth around $820. Around 650k BTC was lost, so that puts the damages at around $0,5B.
If the bitcoins left over were indeed around 200k BTC, as you said, then it would mean that all creditors can be paid back if each left over BTC was sold for $2.5k. So if all coins were sold right now, Mr Karpeles could pay off everyone that owed him AND become a billionair.

It actually has something to do with an explosive increase in value in November and December. If you've missed it in the news, shame on you. That bubble has now burst and prices are going back to mean. That's why prices are falling. The drop has nothing to do with Roger Ver's cough, the SEC's fart, the alignment of the planets or the headlines on The Onion. People need to stop searching for reasons that don't exist and just accept the prices are correcting. And will keep on correcting until they reach mean, which I guess is somewhere between $5k and $6k.
