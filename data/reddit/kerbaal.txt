Leaving us to ponder, which group is greater, the people trying to figure out what this means to the markets; or the people trying to figure out how this draws a penis?

One thing I wonder on  lets say I sell on an exchange, then the exchange pulls a gox and I never get my money. Did I realize anything just becuase they said they sold it for me? Or do I realize it only after the legal battle and possible settlement?
Not in that situation, but, having seen these things go down in the past and, you know it will happen again in the future, how bad of a limbo is someone in in a case like that?

Its tempting to think everything needs a technological solution but, you need enough people to actually adopt it. How about a noise based solution?
Maybe its time for mining pools to look at what privacy concerned individuals that they service actually want and for those people to ask for.... a data retention policy!
Logging IPs is actually fairly reasonable, if a person can use tor, its even easy to deal with from a concerned client end. However, what need is there for them days later? Weeks later? If some of the data is useful, great, can IPs and any other PII (thats personally identifying information) be scrubbed? Perhaps users could have an option to request their data be retained longer, for some compliance need or even just because their system was stolen and they are tracking the thief as someone elsewhere in this discussion suggested. 
But data retention is not hard to implement at all and is a very sensible policy to have. Its something descerning bitcoin miners should look for in a pool and judge pools based on. 
edit: and while we are at it, how many of them have warrant canaries?
