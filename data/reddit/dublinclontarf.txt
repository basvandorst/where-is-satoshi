I don't know how long you've been using GMail, I've been using it since it began and before that I used Yahoo for email. The difference between Yahoo and GMail in regards to spam was colossal. The majority of people don't get much spam now, I'm getting it at a rate of about 2-3 per month.
Anyway you should have a look at this  it's pretty much the most common and effective form of spam filtering and is what GMail use. As I've said, the spam problem has, as of now been fixed, although this may change in the future.

I think the spam problem has been largely fixed with bays filtering.

A crash back to 1-2USD would not be a bad thing. Short of there being a massive outside reason (collapse of Euro for example) or internal reason (brand new must have service paid only in bitcoin) then the price growth should be steady.
Another cause may be that something that WAS holding back the price of BTC is now gone.
@_date: 2012-01-04 20:37:09
So does that mean the price is going to go up?

Ripple is a small time version of what caused the banking crisis, the idea that debt from one person was the same as another, and could be packaged up and sold off.
Debt from a friend is not the same as debt from a person who is removed 7 or 8 times. 
The overall result would be the same, you would have a short lived boom (if it ever took off) and result in a massive bust as the knock on effects from people defaulting spread through the system.

Pretty much, this is inflation.

An option is where you buy the right to buy something at a specified price for during a specified time.
If the price goes over what your option says then you're doing good, if not then you lost that money you spent on the option, on the other hand, if the price Had risen...

A GLBSE client, have a look at the python (and JavaScript) code on the dev page (at the bottom) of glbse.com
GLBSE, Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange, I'm sure if your client is anyway half decent the owners will pay you for it (probably bitcoin).

If they have $1 and someone gives them another, they have grown their economy by 100%. They could grow 200% a year but if all they're starting with is SFA(Sweet Fuck All) then those numbers don't mean crap.

Fees are not mandatory.

Use your common sense, of course Gox keeps the btc.
@_date: 2011-02-06 23:00:07
That is exactly what it is, and shares are being sold for bitcoin. First (tiny) round has already been completed.

Is there an unlimited amount of gold to mine? 
Are you telling me that as long as I keep digging the stuff will keep showing up?

Yes. Its a very handy way of moving from one fiat currency to another :D

If you have some gold, and someone else loses their gold how is this a bad thing for you? 
There is less gold in the world, but there will never be none, and the gold you now have left is worth more.
Replace gold with bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-09-02 06:16:20
Yeah not yet. And that's part of the problem. In the same way bitcoin.com was bought by tradehill someone will register Bitcoin as a trademark unless a non-profit for the community does it first.
@_date: 2011-09-02 03:49:37
There already IS an instant money transfer service, it's called WesternUnion, the only problem is they're pricey.
@_date: 2011-08-30 15:36:17
tldr; some (not all) of the prices are actually better if you buy in bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-09-05 04:57:35
Very useful as a value transfer system, and with th help of options contracts its great for hiding wealth.
@_date: 2011-09-10 19:45:18
Is he wrong?
@_date: 2011-08-21 15:08:21
Sure, you could use GLBSE for just that. Talk to nefario his contact info is on the site, he'll help you do it.

The first job is for Javascript and is an ongoing contract, the second is a once off $1500 worth of bitcoins for building a ruby library to LibertyReserve.
@_date: 2011-09-05 15:16:07
I dont know why this is getting voted down, he's mostly right. GLBSE works along similar lines (smart contracts) but there is very little there that could be used to enforce those contracts.
The only thing that could (short the smart contracts getting recognised in the first realm)would be to implement a murder market, such that if you violate a contract over a certain amount you're going to get your legs broken,  if the cotract you violate is high enough value you...get murdered.

Actually worried more about the server the bitcoin is stored on and how well it's secured.
@_date: 2011-08-10 20:07:37
Because of all the chargebacks they're implementing Know Your Customer regs.

Not charity, business. They're buying the Polish market.

Do you have a better idea(really, do you, would be much obliged)?
@_date: 2011-09-02 03:49:00
There is a reason that there are no instant payment transfers, unless using WesternUnion.
So unless they're setting up a WesternUnion like system this isn't going to end up with the startup going out of business from scamming.

Yeah, but sometimes people are just plain old nice. Often (not always) people get bags of cash they lost returned to them (if there was any contact information in the bag).
Yes you must asssume that they will not give back but mostly people tend to be good.

Missing link to bitcoin stock market
@_date: 2011-09-02 03:40:21
She (in the video) has no idea what she's talking about, it's only to give the impression that they're on top of things (so as not to make themselves look incompetent).
She says about in the past they were able to get target people? This (tech-nol-ogy as she says) has specifically been developed over the last 10 years to prevent the likes of the police being able to track people.
The absolute worse they will be able to do is pose as sellers and catch the odd buyer, and they won't even be able to do much of that.
I would say idiots but that video is just to give the adverage person (that doesn't understand how things work) the impression that they're tackling it. It's a PR piece.
@_date: 2011-07-29 17:21:33
Is this the same Paxum that MagicalTux of mtgox was pissing all over on the bitcoin forums recently?
Has this change of heart come as a result of gox trying to find an alternative to dwolla before it collapses?

No, you just cant transfer $1 to Africa from the U.S. as the fees are greater than the money being sent.
@_date: 2011-07-27 11:46:29
In the blog post he did mention that his last trip to the U.S. was in 2000, and that the experience was very pleasant, he even says that yes he was naive.
However, you arrive with only $600 (when you're main source of income is going to be bitcoin), what would you say when they start questioning you? 
Don't forget he'd been traveling for a few days already before arriving.

I try to get around this problem by keeping all my transactions in bitcoin and if possible not exchange in or out. Although I am principally operating in the bitcoin economy when I'm spending anything online.

Newbies rarely do, they think that just because it's digital that it's different. The important thing is that it has the needed properties of good money.
Some of those being:
a store of value,
limited in supply
You can use anything as money as long as it has these qualities. Some things make better money than others. Gold, silver is very good. Paper money is ok but gets most of it's value by government fiat. Prisons have candy and cigarettes, Schools have whatever the latest card game craze is (remember Pog? better than gold when I was a kid). Anything.

This is very painful for bitcoin, I know quite a few people who lost quite a bit (although not as much as Bruce) in this.
On the other hand it really isn't the end of bitcoin, this is a difficult lesson that (hopefully) has been learned. You can't simply trust someone based on them being there the longest, you need something else.
It also means that users should be be more careful, and less trusting.
