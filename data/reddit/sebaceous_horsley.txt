I took a quick glance at the code, and from what I can tell it's much more dark market ready than OB since it doesn't require you to host shop nodes, and it works over TOR, VPNs and other anon protocols. Not sure how it avoids sybil attacks, but the idea is cool.

Always sell your exploit to the highest bidder.
@_date: 2015-12-17 18:30:37
Interesting. Sounds a lot better than having your own browser to browse them like OB does.

OKCoin keeps copies of its private keys with relatives of the CEO who don't even know what Bitcoin is. They don't use multi-sig. They are so critically mismanaged that if it goes fully GOX, expect no sympathy.

OpenBazaar _is_ decentralized, it's the individual stores that are centralized.
Glad to see DZ fix this issue. Good work. Did you code this?

If he's such a prodigy, why is he at 3 moneygrab, mostly hot air projects? (serious)

Wait. hosting their own Factom chains on MS servers? Doesn't that mean that the original Factom coins will be worth absolutely nothing?
@_date: 2015-12-17 22:28:32
Yes. That was my point. Not sure what you gain from repeating it, but ok.
@_date: 2015-06-14 13:03:41
Sorry about that, turns out its only visible to connections... 
@_date: 2014-12-18 14:43:08
I think Ayn Rand and the red pill community are disgusting, and childish. I mean look at her life story, it doesn't exactly motivate you to follow her ideals. I don't understand your point. There is no _problem_. I've never seen this phenomenon _anywhere_ else than OKC. 
It's not that difficult to pick one of the other 100 websites out there at random. It just has the highest incidence of cray...
@_date: 2014-12-18 14:37:02
For whatever reason, out of all dating websites, people on OKCupid are notoriously the worst. You can go anywhere else and you won't find as many soulless, vegan, man-hating femnazis with a tumblr complex. Seriously, _anywhere_ else is so much better that I'm wondering if there's something inherently wrong with that site. Something like 90% of the profiles in my area are all militant vegetarians.
@_date: 2014-12-21 19:34:31
I find vegan, man-hating femnazis really off-putting. I don't know why you would think I care about their opinion of me. I only date people who don't ooze frustration at the opposite gender.
@_date: 2014-12-18 14:55:36
Yeah of course there are decent girls on there, but after a few completely insane dates I decided to use a different website, where I was honestly _shocked_ at how much more well adjusted the people were there on average.
@_date: 2014-12-18 16:22:30
And I think the stronger belief people (male and female) also scare away the 'moderates' over time. So I think we accurately figured out the OKC phenomenon. Great talk, thanks.
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:08:22
Maybe that attracts the wrong kind of people? To me it feels like job applications and recruiting people, haha. Maybe I'm just oldschool because I prefer going outside.
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:04:35
Well I did say the _people_ on OKC are the worst. Most likely that applies to men as well, it's just that I wouldn't know. One of my female friends said that the guys there were the most prone to rage issues.... and threw a tantrum if you postponed by a day. But I can't speak from experience on that, since I date women....
@_date: 2014-12-18 14:39:55
There's bitter and misogynistic men on every dating website... doesn't make a difference.
@_date: 2015-05-26 12:50:47
I thought that was just a rumor?
@_date: 2014-11-30 11:57:33
Thank you robot dearest.

I have been working on a theory that cryptocurrencies are essentially cults. Looks like he thought the same thing, and banked in big time on that idea.

Congrats, you've just mined 100 islamophobiacoins by posting this title.

And ironically less theoretical

Spot on, how else would they appease investors?

Another quality RaptorXP post...
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:23:15
Beautiful answer. I hope Snowden sees it.
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:47:16
Many people think owning 51% is a magic key to unraveling Bitcoin and changing transactions that are years old... **Nope.**
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:44:55
How is buying Bitcoin not an investment? If demand increases, then the current price can't be supported anymore.
@_date: 2015-08-14 15:25:18
You realize this applies to Average Joe who wants to sell his friends $5 of Bitcoin?

Honduras, one of the poorest countries in the Americas, has agreed to use a Texas-based company to build a permanent and secure land title record system using the underlying technology behind bitcoin, **a company official said late Thursday**.
@_date: 2015-08-05 08:44:07
Can we get a clear answer to this?


@_date: 2015-08-14 23:03:44
So... no argument then. Got it. 
P.S I'd like to see a business that appreciated 500,000+%. And if you're saying its very speculative, then it must have potential to be an investment. No?
If you invest in a grocery store, it is unlikely to reach every human being on earth.
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:49:08
Why is it different?
@_date: 2015-08-14 23:07:00
You need 51% for _one block_. You can't just go backwards with the same amount of hashing power, because time doesn't stand still. And do you not think the 'consensus' would notice?
@_date: 2015-08-15 09:18:06
Coindesk, Reuters, German newspapers, etc. Tons of places.
@_date: 2015-08-14 17:44:29
Nobody thinks banks will want to do that. Decentralization circumvents them. Honestly you are one of the least informed individuals on this subreddit and you keep posting, and posting and posting.
@_date: 2015-08-14 20:02:59
If they used BitPay it wouldn't suck so hard. I'm not sure what they're using.
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:59:43


HAHAHA! Good luck. You would need more computing power than has ever existed on earth, and a way to slow down time. You would need to take the world's top 500 supercomputers and make like 1,000,000,000,000 of them. For that money you could just give every human being on earth a million dollar contract and a truck full of precious metals to stop using Bitcoin.
And besides... who the _fuck_ would use your fork of the chain afterwards?

Yes please, I'd love to have a proprietary software and hardware locked raspberry pi connected an outdated miner which periodically sends money to a corporate entity. Makes total sense. Sign me up.
@_date: 2015-11-26 12:27:00
Wonder how much of their $120 mil 21 is spending on shilling which explains nothing about the actual use-cases of their proprietary crapbox.
@_date: 2015-11-02 12:52:11


@_date: 2015-10-18 06:51:03
Yes, _I know_. I'm trying to see what you think it does. It's not a sidechain and it's relies on centralized trust. The writing is so vague it can be interpreted in many ways. This looks like it will be a lot of fun.....
@_date: 2015-10-18 05:57:08
I wonder how long it will take people to learn about the thermite and realize this is complete horseshit.
@_date: 2015-10-18 06:39:56
@_date: 2015-10-18 06:05:07
No, because unlike forum posters they would do their research and laugh at this.
@_date: 2015-10-18 06:27:11
Yes, but what they wrote is suspiciously vague.
@_date: 2015-11-06 21:21:16
I noticed that cam sites with other types of payments usually gamble with the money and pay out once a month. With Bitcoin you can theoretically withdraw whenever you like.
Also Tiffany's is bizarrely smart, I chatted with her briefly.
@_date: 2015-03-16 06:36:33
Thanks for jerking everyone around. I've been keeping track of your official statements and really, you flip flop so much that I find it hard to trust your enterprise. You don't even provide any information about what you will use. As late as a month ago, Overstock representatives said _in person_ that you will be using Counterparty. I don't think this is too professional...
@_date: 2015-10-18 06:04:12
What is that even supposed to mean!?!?!? 
@_date: 2015-11-10 19:10:03
As someone who earns their living in BTC, this is really useful. Can't wait to pay my groceries in BTC.

That seems redundant. How are the servers even secured?

Forum mass migrations don't work unless they happen organically.And I'm not sure if Roger is trustworthy.
