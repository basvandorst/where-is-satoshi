Keep an eye on your email, and thank you for the support!
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:33:56
Send us a custom order request at contact including the model name, capacity, and condition of the phone. Also make sure you let us know you're international. We'll then go ahead and process your order!
@_date: 2014-02-07 02:13:47
Thank you for the support - we're excited to give you bitcoins in return!
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:08:40
Sorry we're currently only accepting major carriers within the United States. Canada is at the forefront of our international expansion plans.
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:22:26
Thank you very much for the support!  We have tons of work to do but it's coming along. We really feel that we can help drive Bitcoin adoption with this model.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:51:19
Thanks for spreading the word! A beta key request at this time shouldn't take more than a few hours. We do plan on launching in Britain but we don't have a set date for now.
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:46:31
The list is a bit long, we currently accept over a thousand different models. Feel free to request a beta invitation at  and you'll be able to check them all out!
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:09:18
Thank you, we flagged our developer! :)
PM us your bitcoin address.
@_date: 2014-02-07 02:57:06
We will! Lets first get you set up with a beta key, send us an invite request at 
@_date: 2014-02-13 01:49:55
Thank you! If you use it, feel free to give us feedback. We're good listeners!
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:22:38
Going international is a huge priority for us and we're working hard on getting it done correctly. It takes time, but we're getting there!
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:44:56
If you have a second please jump on our site chat "We're here to help!" button on the bottom right.  We would like get you passed w/e issue your encountering.
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:41:54
We like you liking the idea. :)
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:23:46
You're not so evil after all. Thank you for the support and happy cake day!
@_date: 2014-02-08 14:04:59
You can visit our website and see if you have any electronics that you'd like to get rid of in return for bitcoins! 
Make sure to request a beta invite!
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:39:19
We're debating hiring you for customer service. :P
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:40:57
We accept a large range of Android phones and cameras on top of Apple iPods, iPhones, iPads and Macbooks.
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:18:09
We resell them to other people who need them. In the near future we'll be offering them for purchase with bitcoins!
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:41:43
Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:17:38
We're not mobile optimized for the beta but will be for official launch. You can either communicate to us by email or through online chat, whichever one is more convenient for you. Thank you for the support!
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:27:07
Where do you seem to be running into a problem?  Looks good on our end.  Are you having issues logging in or are you awaiting an invite? Feel free to email us at support
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:45:30
Thanks for the fixed link!
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:08:29
If you have any feedback for us we'd love to hear it! contact
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:21:38
Thanks for checking us out.  Let us know if you run into any other problems.
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:33:09
It could be due to the amount of traffic that we're getting. The majority of users aren't having issues. Do you get this 404 by accessing the homepage, or the registration page, or both?
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:21:08
Hey I just wanted to remind everyone that Mintspare accepts a wide variety of electronics and pays you in bitcoins as soon as we receive your product. There's no need to wait till a buyer is found. Bitcoins are then sent to your very own Mintspare wallet instantly!
See for yourself what products we accept, it'll only take a second (or two)! 
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:33:37
Thanks, we think you're pretty cool!
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:18:05
Here at Mintspare we are a fan of crypto-currencies in general and have not ruled out the option of accepting alt coins at a future date. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:27:21
Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:01:57
Thanks for the heads up! We've let our developers know about it.
@_date: 2014-02-13 00:55:47
Him speaking! I do not. This was done because of personal preferences. I won't be disappearing. My business address is public and I welcome private tours to it. I was fully identified by a well known stock exchange, Mintspare was crowd-funded and we raised over a quarter million dollars. I'm here to stay and be part of Bitcoin's explosion in the year 2014 and beyond. =)
If you'd like to further discuss this I'd be happy to talk via email to reassure you or anyone else for that matter. I believe your careful approach on such a situation is very valid. (Email: my first name @ mintspare.com )
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:18:40
We support you supporting this message! :)
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:45:06
We share the same vision!
@_date: 2014-03-14 00:45:44
Hey nextgeneric,
Galfry, founder of Mintspare here! I wasn't able to replicate the bug you speak of, feel free to contact me at galfry and I'd be more than happy to be of any assistance!
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:17:38
iPhone 3G is listed on our site.  A beta account is required at this time in order to browse our offerings.  Go to  to request a beta key.  Thank you for you interest!
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:26:54
Send us a beta request at  and you'll be able to narrow in on a specific capacity and condition to find out the exact price we'd offer you.
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:33:18
Hopefully this will give them a wake up call.
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:48:06
Thank you for the support! :)
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:34:33
That's very kind of you, we appreciate the support! :)
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:06:51
You're pretty cool yourself.
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:17:31
They're definitely of interest to us, we're just taking some time to accept additional electronics as well as expanding internationally because we want to do it right.
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:46:16
Thanks for the support! :)
@_date: 2014-03-15 15:15:31
We're legit! I'm Galfry, the founder of Mintspare. Feel free to reach out to me at Galfry if you have any questions or concerns!
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:34:25
Can you get with us on online chat? We'll try to fix this problem as soon as possible.
Simply go to  and select "We're help to help!" at the bottom right of the page.
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:41:08
Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:29:24
We're looking to launch internationally in the near future! 
Our price list will be viewable to all once we close our beta. During the beta, we require a beta key in order to browse our website.
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:23:02
We don't currently have a specific timeline for Europe, although it's definitely on our minds!
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:22:36
You're the best! Launching in Britain is really high up on our to-do list, but there's a lot of logistic and technical issues that need to be figured out. Keep an eye out for us. :)
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:31:52
We believe that both are doable if someone has the right intentions, and we'd like to think we do.
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:15:07
Sorry at the moment we are not mobile optimized.  At full launch all features will be available across all platforms.  In addition you will be able to browse our offerings and pricing without creating a login.
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:31:40
That's a lot of bitcoins! 
Thank you for the heads up, we fixed that bug recently. We'll be in beta for another two weeks or so.
@_date: 2014-02-13 00:43:15
There's some information here: 
We'll also be releasing more information on our operators and board of advisory in the near future!
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:33:35
It's not an environmentally friendly one though.
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:21:22
You only have to sign up for the private beta. If you'd like to wait till our official launch in March, you'll be able to browse the entire site without ever making an account.
@_date: 2014-02-10 03:06:04
Thank you for the support TWAM13!
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:17:16
Make sure you check out  and trade in that iPhone .  We are in beta currently but still processing two orders per customer.
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:33:27
Still having an issue?
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:53:23
You can submit that information along with your carrier on our site and it will provide you with an automatic quote. If you haven't requested a beta key yet in order to have access to the site, you can do so at:
