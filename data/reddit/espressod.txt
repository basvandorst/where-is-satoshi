Please explain why paying advertisers have negative reviews. Why aren't they using the "delete negative review" button you're alleging exists?

HBS empirically tested and subsequently debunked the extortion conspiracy theory  (see Section 3.4)

That's why I linked the article, but here's key quote in the intro: 
"The Hagertys can’t actually prove they were extorted; nor can, it seems, any other small business owner who’s made this claim. When interviewed, the Hagertys won’t even say that the claim their sign made is in fact true. Salakjit Hagerty, who talked with the Yelp salesperson, does not speak English well. Larry, who wrote the sign, admits he was never on the phone with anyone from Yelp. Does he definitely know what was said to his wife? “I can’t say definitely because I didn’t speak to them,” he says. At first he says “every” positive review of the business disappeared from the site; when reminded Yelp only contacts businesses with three-star overall ratings or higher, he goes silent."
Business owners with negative reviews have a lot of incentive to attempt to poke holes in the system, but anecdotes alleging this stuff have never led to any smoking gun evidence of malfeasance on Yelp's part. On the contrary, rigorous empirical studies have *debunked* them.

False. Encourage you to read this long form piece:  
TL;DR HBS has debunked the extortion claim and many businesses have incentive to sling BS about Yelp because not all businesses can have perfect ratings.

Because Yelp aggressively filters out fake reviews posted by the business owners and this angers them.

False.
