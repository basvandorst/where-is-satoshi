And what makes you think that governments or banks won’t come up with their own crypto? Instead of buying trillions of BTC, they could use half that money and create their own that could be way more reliable and sufficient.

Fuck off dude!! Don’t give us that scam shit!!
portbitcoin must be brain-dead to want to loose money like that... which means it’s too good to be true... which means it’s a scam... and which also means that most likely you are in it as well and here trying to motivate new innocent buyers to loose their money.
So get lost!!

Do some critical thinking, dude!
What kind of moron would want to loose money like that??
Always remember that if it sounds too good to be true it is certainly a scam.

What do you mean as long as I use all my entire stack?
Say I had 10k in fiat money on gdax, yet only used 5k for that 2 month period, how does not using all 10k affect how much taxes I pay?
I assume that I would, again, only pay what I used—which, therefore, would still not make a difference because my net tax burden is still zero, right?

Guys, first time doing taxes for crypto.
Anyone know of a good way to do my taxes for crypto?
Coinbase has a horrible way to show the history of your money, and so does Binance, so I am assuming there is an easier way?
@_date: 2019-01-11 10:27:13
That’s what I was thinking as well.
I know how much went in and how much I made/lost. But a few months ago someone told me that I had to lay out every transaction made in any exchange from day one of the year 2018. Meaning, every time I bought and sold coins it has to be reported. That’s way too much of a hassle. I thought I could just say how much went in and how much I made/lost by the end of the year.
So I can just do that and no problems with the IRS?
Plus, what form do I use to report it? And does it have to be done together with the non-crypto taxes?
On a side note:
Can’t believe the moron CEO of amazon cheated on his ex-wife, there goes billions of dollars towards a wife that didn’t contribute anything to the creation of amazon, and all because the retard had to cheat.

Obviously that is possible, but that means i have to purchase bitcoin and send it, price could go down during that process and money is lost.
Any other way?
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:14:35
Yes but after I sold, right?
Say I bought at 8k and it went up to 8.1k and I sold at that price, that would be more than 1% of profit.

Thanks, I will look it up.

Guys, have you noticed how the exchange ALWAYS goes up between 6-10am/pm, always that range.
I assume it's because when it's morning here it's evening in china, and vice versa. People start to invest after they get back from work.
So this means that the next 3-5 hours will be steady, quiet, not much ups and downs. After that, it's either downhill or uphill.
Now although it is scary because you never know when people decide to pull out their profit, at least we know the time range at which it will happen—or so I assume.
Get ready for the next hit folks.
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:42:12
All that means is that you buy back in when it's lower and sell when it's higher. Use some new money to buy in low and when it goes up high you can at least balance out your money or even make some in the process.
As long as prices go up and down you have chances of making money. You don't need to wait for 20k to make a decent profit.

What we need is a Natural Law Resource Based Economy, look up Jacque Fresco from The Venus Project and Peter Joseph from the Zeitgeist Movement.
As long as we have fiat money backed up by debt people around the world WILL suffer, WILL become homeless/jobless, WILL continue see wealth inequity and many more problems.
A NLRBE won't be a perfect system (no such thing as a "utopia")—especially during its transitional stages since it will take time for our current outdated and useless value-systems and beliefs to be overcome—but it will, nonetheless, be better in every way than any monetary system was/is/will ever be.
For now, since we are still in our comfort zones, people will oppose a NLRBE, but wait till shit really starts to fall apart, wait till we end up in a huge depression. It is in times of pain that we come together to create something better for the future. 
Steve Jobs didn't just give us the IPhone and said "there you go, figure that shit out yourself", he had to EDUCATE people about the IPhone for people to begin believing in it and take the necessary steps to support it and see it grow even further.
The same principle applies to a NLRBE, we need people to be educated about such a system, how it will function, how we will engage and interact in such a system, and etc.
Crypto-currencies/block-chain technology will possibly fail for one simple reason, and that is that the majority of humans have already been brainwashed to seek profit over everything, because profit brings about a "happier life".
"for the love of money is the root of all evil"
PS: But don't become a hippie now and start living in the woods, you know, the "off-the-grid" type of person. We obviously need money UNTIL we transition into a NLRBE. Till then, this shit is all we got and we can only hope that crypto will eventually do a better job than fiat.

You missing the point about the CEO of amazon, but that’s ok, it was just a side note.
I still don’t understand what I am supposed to do with the taxes, like which form or the same form as regular taxes and etc., but it’s ok, I will google it and see what comes up.
Thanks for your help

I get taxed less on what trades? What is LTCG and how do I maximize my LTCG bracket?
Sorry, this is new to me. I thought it was as simple as paying regular income taxes, around 25% and good to go.

Actually, being rich or poor from a monetary perspective doesn't mean much without being rich at heart.
There are many poor people who, after making millions, becomes just as much of a greedy asshole as some rich people are right now.
So what you probably mean is that we need people with a rich heart to switch positions with those who are rich financially yet poor at heart.

Thanks for making it easy to understand.
But why is there sometimes talk about whales dumping or manipulating the market when, by sound of it, it's very difficult for whales to even pull a 1% profit, let alone a 10% or more.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:33:36
I had a question if anyone could help me out with it.
I bought bitcoin on coinbase and also added money to gdax, however, since this is my very first time, both of those transactions are taking 3-5 days to complete, in the meantime I can only buy again with new money which I don't want to do since I already bought bitcoin and also added money to gdax.
Once the money arrives at gdax in my usd account, is that a somewhat safe place to keep the money until my ledger nano s arrives? Of course once it arrives at gdax I want to start investing, however, that "usd account" does not seem to be an actual wallet.
On coinbase it does say "bitcoin wallet" so I assume that that is a safe place to keep the bitcoins for now.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:05:22
Hey peeps, have a question.
Say I have 10 million and bought bitcoin right now at market value, I assume the price would go up because of the high quick volume. Could I then just sell it again once it reached, say, a 1% increase in profit to make 100k in ~30 minutes?
I am wondering if that is how big whales play on the exchange, and also, whether or not such behavior is even legal or allowed.
@_date: 2018-02-19 14:56:48
Hey folks, bought a Nano Ledger S so that I can keep my bitcoins safe, should arrive in 2-3 weeks.
However, I heard that you always pay a fee when transferring your money from, say, gdax or coinbase to the Ledger, is that true?
And if so, how does one avoid those fees when transferring money into and out of the Ledger?
@_date: 2018-02-19 06:59:58
So if I sell and buy bitcoin throughout the year, it is considered &lt; 1 year (current income tax rate) , and if I buy bitcoin and KEEP it for more than one year it is considered &gt; 1 year (around 15%)??
When do I have to decide on FIFO vs LIFO? From moment to moment as I am trading, or at the very end when it is time to pay taxes?
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:52:54
Hey guys!!!!
I am new to crypto/bitcoin, I was wondering if you can buy in more than once???
Say I bought at 10k and it fell to 9k, can I buy in at 9k again and have 2 buy orders from the same account?
And if I can, how does gdax know which one out of the two I am trying to sell if, let's say, it goes up to 11k??
Meaning, I would be making a 1k profit from my 10k but-in order and 2k from my 9k buy-in order. How does gdax know which of the two will sell first when I sell at 11k??
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:45:49
It definitely is a great time to buy.
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:48:08
Thank you buddy, that was really helpful.

Dude, cryptocurrencies have trillions of dollars and many millions of people involved, holding your money at a bad time is more likely to do good than it is going to do bad—unless something better comes around to make crypto disappear.
Plus keep in mind that this is just the beginning of the year and almost everything has to do with how people FEEL.
Once this college semester is over and summer kicks in people will be buying crypto again.
Of course there are other factors that play a role in the ups and downs (such as whales selling their coins or buying more, and etc.).
But to think that it will go down so badly and for so long that cutting your losses is the best option is just insane.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:22:43
oh yeah, that's right, can't sell if no one wants to buy, so that's why buying at all once is almost impossible with huge cash. 
Which is good because people won't be able to take advantage of the exchange.
But how do big whales manipulate the price so as to make profit? I keep on hearing that they can do such a thing yet no-one has explained it in detail.
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:23:03
Hey folks, I had a question regarding taxes when investing in bitcoin.
Say you bought at 5k and invested 5k, meaning you got 1 bitcoin exactly, it then goes up to 6k, that means a profit of 1k and taxes are taken out off that 1k profit, easy as pie.
However, what happens when you trade for, say, 2 months. 
- Got in at 5k, 1 week later you sold at 6k = 1k profit
- 2nd week buys in at 5.5k and sells the 3rd week for 6k = .5k profit
- 4th week buys in at 6.5k and sold the following week at 6k = .5k loss
- 6th week buys in at 8k and sold the following week at 7k = 1k loss
- 8th week didn't do shit because you upset you lost all your gains.
Now, with that example in mind, as I understand it, you actually have to pay taxes on EVERY transaction that you made leading up to the end of the second month.
Meaning, even though you are back to 5k in fiat money, you STILL have to pay taxes on the transactions where you made profit, right?
PS: I am asking because one youtube video mentioned that it is exactly for that reason that day-trading is not so good of an idea when you consider the taxes that will have to be taken out for every transaction.
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:59:37
Nobody can tell you to get in now or not.
The range at which it seems to have gone up in the past 36 hours was between 6-10am/pm, after that it was much more quiet and steady.
So, you can buy in now and hope that it goes uphill again between 6-10am, or it will go downhill because people want to take out their profits.
I have a feeling it will go up again so waiting till 4am to buy in again at a slightly lower price.
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:05:54
That is IF it goes down to 1/4 of the price, it could go down just slightly more and then back up. The best way to invest when there is a dip is to put NEW money into those dips while holding the old money.
Say you bought 5k at 10k market value and it dipped down to 5k market value, if you add another 5k at that dip and it goes back up to 10k, you make 100% profit on the new money while loosing nothing on the old, that way you make a greater profit than you would have selling the old money at, say, 7k to cut your losses and reinvesting it at 5k. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:55:59
If I invested 10k in bitcoin, made 5k profit and 2 months later lost 5k in profit, would that not result in 0% taxes since the net profit is 0?
Keep in mind that during that whole time I kept on buying and selling over and over again from fiat to bitcoin and still ended up loosing the initial 5k in profit.
This whole tax thing is a little confusing, do you still pay taxes on the profit that was made even though the end result is the orIginal 10k that you began investing with? Meaning no profit actually made at the end.
@_date: 2019-05-12 04:41:19
How do?
@_date: 2019-05-12 04:40:25
Is it even worth taking a risk now? I know someone said that ppl who were part of the 7k loss on Binance will try to re-establish themselves and thus more bitcoins will be bought, but I just don’t see if it’s worth taking a risk now instead of waiting for the next set-back and then reinvest. Any thoughts??
