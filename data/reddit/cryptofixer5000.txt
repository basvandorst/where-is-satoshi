The global financial meltdown of 2008 saw stocks fall 40% and rebound to new highs less than 2 years later. Btc is down ~85%, and you think it's going to replace the current financial system. I'm not trolling. Just trying to get the delusion out of your head. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:48:40
I'll just interpret that as, you have no clue what you're talking about. However, I'll still give you a chance to explain how fractals have anything to do with markets or prices. Go ahead, buddy. Give it it try
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:35:19
You want the lower class to buy bitcoin and lose 85% in the last year. I want the lower class to save their hard earned money and lose the 1% inflation from their savings accounts. There is clearly a better option.

No, because it hasn't happened yet. Your crystal ball analogy is flawed. Bitcoin enthusiasm peaked in december 2017. It already happened. No crystal ball needed. The dollar and markets have no tipping point. There is no hype about them. But, you can go ahead and tell me your conspiracy laden predictions if you want. Being generous, I'd say there's about a 95% chance I'm right and at least that much chance that you're wrong.

Another very useless price trend theory. If there is one thing I've learned about bitcoin enthusiasts, it's that they'll expend endless mental energy trying to learn about pointless, unhelpful things just to try to get rich with minimal effort. They've collectively outsmarted themselves believing that their intelligence/ understanding of something complicated somehow would translate into the destruction of wall street and the entire financial system. And the very sad thing now, is that they're expending ridiculous mental energy in analyzing the past price movements and looking for patterns and trends that confirms their beliefs. It's not good. Trend/price analysis work only as well as coin flipping. This has been proven over and over again in the stock market.

The Fed raises rates when, the economy is booming, unemployment is really low, and/or inflation needs to be controlled. They drop rates when unemployment is high, the economy crashes, etc... to prevent a deflationary spiral (e.g., another great depression). The Fed doesn't produce the national debt. Congress does. The Fed prints money and, you probably don't know this, the Fed BURNS money too. They are currently BURNING money..., which is effectively the same thing as raising rates.

Despite what people are saying, the reality is NOBODY is excited about it. You know what people would be excited by? BTC at $100,000. Not gonna happen buddy. The people who claim to be "excited" by this supposed buying opportunity, are in such severe denial about bitcoin's failure, they're just hoping there are other suckers out there that are dumb enough to absorb their additional losses. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:34:16
Quoting Buffet, aye? You know he also said bitcoin is rat poison. There is no way to know whether it's a bargain or not. Also, if you're looking at price trends, you've already lost. People were rationalizing their buy decisions the same way when it was at $11k, then 9k, then 8k, then 6500, etc., etc. It's crumbling. You have to be really stupid to buy now. There is literally nothing that can cause the price to go up at this stage. Bitcoin sentiment is so negative now. And that's your only true gauge for its future price. It's a failed investment, a failed currency, and a failed political movement. That's the current sentiment.

@_date: 2018-11-20 22:51:02
You're not making any sense, and the multiple question marks don't help. BTC price is almost exactly correlated with enthusiasm, or google searches for the word "bitcoin." That peaked last december. Market potential has nothing to do with where the price is going. You could say that since only 600 million people own iPhones, Apple stock is massively underpriced because there are 7 billion people on the planet. But that's a stupid conclusion. Get it?????

I mostly get downvoted in this sub. I don't have anything against bitcoin. Just been seeing a price implosion and trying to get people out while they still have something left. I started back when the price was $11k, and you would not believe how many times I've been insulted and how creative people get. Meanwhile, they've lost a lot of money and will continue to.

The Dow is made up of huge cash producing corporations. It is totally unanalagous to a single cryptocurrency that does not produce anything. The price to earnings ratio of the Dow is around 20, which means the market cap is 20 times earnings. Bitcoin's is infinity, because bitcoin produces no earnings, no dividends, and no cash. That means, if you're going to draw an analogy between bitcoin and Dow, a value investor will kindly let you know that an infinite multiple means no margin of safety, insane amounts of risk, and is most likely very overvalued. Also, it's not about participants. It's about hype. People who have heard of it and made the decision to buy or not buy. I'm saying that you'll find very few, if any, people in the entire world who (a) have not heard of it, and (b) would buy given the last year 11 months of decline. Please, try to refute this. I am listening.

The aren't that many that actually want it to go down. Just people that see it at a speculative bubble and are not participating. That paranoia is not really relevant here anyways.

@_date: 2018-11-22 15:30:01
You just described the core of the problem with bitcoin price speculation. It takes a lot of time and energy to understand bitcoin, but understanding it has nothing to do with how much return you should expect to make on an investment in bitcoin. It has no valuation metrics--like earnings, profit margins, debt, R&amp;D expenditures, sales figures, etc--on which someone can form a proper opinion of whether the investment is cheap or expensive. No matter how much you understand it, you are purely speculating on its future price, unless you don't care whether you will make a return or not. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:09:59
No need. I invest to make money. You can keep investing in your political project. Orthogonal... I don't think it means what you think it means. I will always gauge any potential investment on proper valuation. And I would never pressure my family to throw their money at anything other than passive and diversified index funds or roboadvisors. Especially something that is purely speculative, like bitcoin.

I don't have a suggestion. You had the suggestion. But, a bank does not let someone with POA take out a mortgage on his client's house for cash. Especially not for DCA'ing bitcoin. It would definitely need the consent of the property owner. My suggestion is that he leaves assets as they are, and uses his own money to buy bitcoin. Her should not use any more than he's okay with losing. Like, 10% of extra cash.

Not google trends. Google searches. It spiked in December 2017. You'd be very mistaken if you think this type of spike in hype happens with the same thing more than once. This was global hype. Not some mini bump based on a small group of enthusiasts. It's not confirmation bias on my end. I don't have money in bitcoin. I'm just stating pretty obvious facts and trying to get you out of denial. You're wrong about trying to correlate this to world markets or the dollar. They're not based on hype. Google searches for them have never gone through a radical peak that indicates speculative hype. Also, you're sort of correct that the dollar has "peaked" I'm value. It's an inflationary currency by design, so that people use it, instead of "hodl" it. It's a nasty ride you're going through. Don't take it out on people trying to help you.

Chicken and egg fallacy. You don't know whether price initially causes searching or vice versa. However, it's irrelevant now. How do you get it out of its current negative feedback loop? The answer is, you can't. The global hype peaked and dropped. These things never happen twice for the same thing. Business Insider is one of many sources that show this very obvious correlation. That's because it's a correlation based on fact. I'm not acting like it's a surprise. It's not a surprise to me. The only predictions I've heard from you all is "to the moon." You all have "bought the dip" from $11k all the way down to $4k. And it keeps crashing. This is not a "perfect trend of cycles." That is some epic level denial. Time to face reality.

A fallacy is the use of faulty reasoning in making an argument. You said price/hype create a positive feedback loop, which I agree with. But, you're somehow using this to argue it's all coming back, which is very flawed. Your use of chicken/egg in this situation is fallacious. You also falsely equate volatility with hype. That is just plain wrong.
Price of BTC is not predictable, just like the short term price of any stock. If it was, it would have already arrived at the predicted price. Get it? I'm not a part of any circus. Just letting you know, that you can't predict BTC price, and that the price is almost 100% correlated to hype (e.g., google searches for the word "bitcoin").

You're an ideal bitcoin investor. You invest only 10% of your extra cash in bitcoin. You acknowledge that it's highly risky and that you could lose all of that 10%. You enjoy learning the technology, which I totally agree, is very interesting. You believe in it and you believe it will change the world, even though most believe it probably won't. Very nice post. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:07:52
If that's your proper argument, you're so fucked. Tell, who do you think is going to buy this time? You think lightning strikes twice? Once global hype spikes that somehow it can happen again without people saying "bitcoin was a bubble, and it burst"? Who are these suckers you think are going to buy it and send it to the moon? The only sources of money that can help it now are too smart to make that mistake.

Okay, so you suggest the guy already has the money to invest the monthly mortgage payment into bitcoin? Why then, would he posting here asking for suggestions of HOW TO INVEST THE MONEY FROM THE PROPERTY? Why the fuck are you making that assumption? Also, your assumption that POA comes with rights of ownership is fucking stupid. He didn't say he owned the place. He said he got POA.

At least you still have your health... I hope.

Watching the helicopter take a hodler dump while you're taking a real dump. There is something very fitting there.
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:49:31
The answer is NO period. Regardless, it is a joke post. POA doesn't give you power to restructure finances.

So, the shops will be middlemen for fiat bitcoin sales? Brilliant. I bet a bunch of dumb fucks will see this as evidence of adoption
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:11:19
Exactly.

Let me first take the opportunity to salute you Schittlord.... next, it's because he said it himself.

And you think reddit experience makes any difference?
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:21:44
Let's see here. You're on the bitcoin subreddit lying about making tons of money on weed stocks. Sorry to say this buddy, but your situation must be really bad. Hope you see better success in the future. I really do. You must be desperate.

Past price trends never predict future price outcomes. There are thousands of you chart analysts throwing darts, one of you is bound to be in the ballpark of a bottom. Note, there were countless analyst targets saying $7500, $6500, $5800, $5000, $4500, and even $500 as the bottom. Your chart and prediction is not "right on the spot." It's a guess based on a trend. That's all.

Make no mistake whose head is in the sand. Sorry you're getting these losses.

That video is dumb. Transference is real though. You think I'm in denial. Look in the mirror
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:38:52
I'm actually not mistaken. You're taking bitcoin's tech and seem to be correlating that to its price. I'm rebutting OP's post and the supposed underlying message that the price will bounce back based on past trends. Knowledge about btc's tech has nothing to do with its price. I hope you understand.

No it hasn't. It didn't go completely global until late last year. You now have people trading it in pretty much every country in the world. You're wrong and you're in denial.

Factoids... btc at $3800 :)
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:23:28
That's a massive lie, and it's not fooling anybody. Look at the price. Most are getting out. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:22:04
Get out of denial. Your ego is out of control. Get your mind straight. You're obsessed with trying to outsmart others and be right. It's ruining your decision-making. Because you're completely wrong about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:32:07
Just to clarify, there's a difference between price or chart analysis and value analysis. This past analogy has absolutely nothing to do with the current price conditions. This is why chart or price trend analysts are no better at predicting the future than flipping a coin. I've been seeing this video passed around a lot lately as confirmation that hodling is the right move. This is called confirmation bias. It feels good believing that someone else's past mistake proves your current decision-making is correct, even though the two are completely uncorrelated. You want an intelligent prediction? BTC hit its tipping point last December. Everyone in the world learned about it, got excited, and then it faded. You won't get that enthusiasm again, since everyone in the world has already been there and done that. It's over buddy.

Yes, let them. No need to push for an ETF to try to fool people

Right... currency trading is speculation, unless you have inside knowledge, in which case, you're corrupt. No good either way.

Replacing current and historical earnings with other metrics has been done many times before. It doesn't end well. People replaced traditional valuation metrics with things like webpage visits in the late 90s. They were mightily proven wrong when the dot com bubble burst. It may not be unreasonable to think of x times increases, but I don't think it's very realistic given history.

I looked it up. It;s actually the idiotic belief that some top Washington officials conspire to magically manipulate the value of USD for bank or corporate profits.
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:25:32
That's exactly what I'm saying. And the money is exiting bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:43:08
Zero... seriously. If there is no utility for bitcoin as a currency that fiat can't fill, the answer is zero. If you're asking the value of bitcoin as a value store, like gold, then it's not possible to tell until there is a financial crash and bitcoin settles at some arbitrary level. Meanwhile, it's too volatile to predict what the actual value of it is... beyond pure speculation
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:38:35
Didn't ask what?
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:05:39
Well, I guess we don't make them that stupid anymore. I've seen people here wishing that had spare cash a couple weeks ago so they could buy more bitcoin. It's plummeted another 40% since then. Only the dumbest money out there is still playing around with bitcoin. It's about time to pack it up before it gets really bad.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:21:34
In what imaginary universe is bitcoin valued "by commodities"? Do you know what you're talking about?
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:01:35
He meant "not necessarily" bitcoin. He's right though. Cryptocurrencies make dealing drugs and hiring assassins much easier.
