Realistically, most people will continue to recieve their primary income in fiat for some time. That means the process for most people is going to be spending money through lightning but then still paying a fee to top up their channels. The lightning network will reduce the fees because i can pay a single fee to get an amount of money into the lightning network, rather than paying for each transaction individually like before. But the blockchain is still going to be congested from people funding channels and businesses either closing or de-funding channels to get btc out to pay suppliers in fiat.

But it's not a usable currency when the fees are this high. I'd love to spend it and a shop i frequent accepts it but i'd be paying 20% on top of my regular purchase price.

If mining is unprofitable, some miners will stop mining. As an example if 50% of miners drop out then the probability of each remaining miner solving the block doubles. Since almost every miner mines as part of a pool, this effectively doubles the pay out (in btc) for the remaining miners.
It's really not possible for a price drop to cause a "block chain collapse" which i assume you means insufficient miners to run transactions. The most likely effect would just be a decrease in hardware purchases.
Edit: i just looked through your post history and it looks like you're posting the same stuff over and over. You should seriously go and learn about this stuff before you continue posting.

You're pretty much spot on as long as the exchanges also support LN

A blockchain transaction is required to open a channel

Sorry to hear about your job but good for you owning a whole coin!

I can understand why this would make people nervous but in a world where more places accept crypto then it stops being a problem

lol, so harsh

Convert to crypto, then close an empty account

maybe it's more like fusion? I don't think LN was ever promised to be a quick job though

Love the positivity but I'm afraid I bought a bit so it should be on its way back down now
