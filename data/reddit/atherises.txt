He teaches good things. Just gotta listen to the full picture. Playing the board game helped me understand a ton that helps me constantly. For example... One but mistake I made in my first few games was not leaving enough savings. That forced me into debt until it was out of control. Now in real life I have made a point to keep a few thousand in savings for emergencies. Invest the difference on assets that are profitable from the moment of purchase. I wouldn't suggest just learning from him, but he does teach good things

Yes you should hide it, but there are easier ways. You can use a Bitcoin scrambler for instance that makes it much more difficult to track

Don't just hodl. Average down! If you buy ethereum right now, you are looking at 5x profit just for a return to its ATH. It has proven it can hit it. Just keep buying!

It depends on your definitions. If you consider the US dollar a pyramid, than maybe. If you consider the stock market a pyramid, than probably. Otherwise probably not

Right now, each BTC is split into pieces of around .0000001 and could be split into 10x that much whenever needed. Whenever it gets scarce make it possible to trade a smaller piece of BTC

It has to be hodl worthy first XD
@_date: 2018-10-22 07:56:49
In my opinion, that will come after cryptocurrency is commonly used to transfer value on a personal basis
@_date: 2018-10-27 04:13:12
Do not get into Bitcoin for money. Do it if you believe in the tech. If you are confident the markets will crash, you could short which is relatively high risk. You could save with an indexed investment. That means you can't claim all the profits, but you will never lose. The catch there is it may slow down your wins, but losses won't effect you. Honestly, you are looking at years before any real gains can be made from stocks or crypto. Be very careful with your investments
@_date: 2018-10-31 11:13:20
You are right. Cryptocurrency has WAY more potential than google or amazon. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 07:43:20
My personal opinion is that self regulating cryptocurrency is more valuable to me than a larger return. I hope to not see much regulation through governments. By regulation I'm refering to turning cryptocurrency into a new stock market where government forces certain rules to be followed, and tracks and taxes profits and what not. They can mostly regulate through entry point. Prevent people from moving money to where it can't be tracked
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:39:08
It very well could. I secretly hope it does
@_date: 2018-10-20 00:09:34
Coinbase is a legitimately licensed exchange. You can store your money there, but wallets are safer from hacking attempts. I personally don't use wallets because I day trade, so I need money on the exchanges. You can connect a bank account and use that to add money to your account, or send it back to your bank when you want to claim profits or otherwise take money out. The fee is 1.5% per trade, unless you transfer to gdax which is directly connected to coinbase. With gdax you can technically avoid all fees if you do it right. I suggest learning gdax relatively quickly. 
@_date: 2019-11-13 21:09:08
I hope you are trolling, but in case you aren't... You have been hit with a common scam. Don't send the money. No businesses have any logical reason to refuse cash or card. The only reason to use Bitcoin only is to prevent people from tracking them after the scam. If they are threatening you, call the police. I guarantee they don't have anything on you. They are just lying to convince you to send money.
@_date: 2018-10-18 13:29:47
Yo mama's so fat, she pulled out of bitcoin, and we hit 100k

If you consider the stock market a pyramid scheme, than Bitcoin could probably be considered one as well

Looks like they did have a name change. Thanks for clarification
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:51:31
Only if you believe the stock market, and forex exchange are as well. It retains value in the same way.
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:40:57
I'm predicting the next BTC high around 200k, so do the math and figure out how much is needed to be rich by your definition

@_date: 2019-02-01 09:53:50
True. Besides we are likely near the end of the bear market I think

5k by July 4th. Bet
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:36:07
I don't short. I just buy low. My last buy was 3800
@_date: 2019-12-08 05:20:59
2.5k, then the moon. Already bought though. Not risking if it if I'm wrong
@_date: 2019-12-14 05:46:12
10 years is enough time for 2 full cycles. Could be a million by then
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:23:42
This last bull run, bitcoin entered the public eye. Now everybody has heard about it. Big time investors, and corporations will look for entry soon, and following that the public will get back into the space. Once it has survived 2 major bear markets, people will begin to trust it as a currency, and even the more cautious investors will join. That should happen once we pass 20k again
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:48:15
Yes. I could see it going as low as $1,000 at the very lowest, but timing the bottom is almost impossible. My suggestion is to buy so you don't miss out, but don't look at it for a year. At current price you are looking at around 3000-6000% profit during this next cycle. You don't want to miss out on this XD just gotta stay strong during the downtrend. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 08:15:12
Any particular reason? Genuinely curious
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:11:32
Many are predicting another year of bear market, and a drop to 2500. Don't bet money you need in the next few months. Long term? Absolutely! Short term? We could see a lot more down action. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:50:23
If you can't afford to lose it, sell out and don't buy back in
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:15:22
Lol why?
@_date: 2018-11-09 05:49:30
It just means less money could cause a larger fluctuation. If somebody wanted to invest $100,000 in 30 different altcoins, the lower market cap coins will typically have the largest fluctuation from the large buy.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:24:34
Exactly. But I could sell anything by request
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:13:43
They do though. They facilitate an exchange between two people. And charge a fee. As long as people have cash and btc to trade, there will be transactions made
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:31:37
My extreme low is 850. If it goes below 1k I will be extremely surprised. At 850 I will rethink my strategy
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:41:34
Been watching that. Probably going to be a huge drop over the next few days
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:42:44
Thinking about it
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:30:58
Yessir! 3100 is my projected bottom so I'm going all in at 3500
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:44:32
Nice! 
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:25:22
3k, 2500, 1k, and 850 are all possible turnaround points (my personal TA, it's okay if you disagree) be prepared for it to go down that low. At the same time it could stay moving up tomorrow! The odds are extremely low of going below that. You have held this long. Just stick it through
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:42:42
We appreciate you taking one for the team!
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:49:13
850 is the next major turnaround point I have. If we go that low, I won't complain. Gives me more time to save and prepare
@_date: 2018-11-24 03:33:32
For the 360th time or something
@_date: 2018-11-14 10:08:15
I won't be surprised if BTC goes down for another year. Even as low as 2500. All I know. Is that it will recover, and it will make me rich. I'm gonna keep buying every time it drops.
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:29:10
I'm excited! A similar drop has happened at the end of many bear markets in the past. Putting my last buy order in around 2500
@_date: 2018-11-04 16:32:47
Neither. An infinite sideways will curse us all
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:14:45
Because it isn't an exact science. Could be as low as 2500 easily, could turn around at 3500. Heck I could be way off. 3500 is my safe buy to ensure I don't miss the buy point
@_date: 2018-11-02 07:19:13
Holy shit you scared me. Gonna give me a heart attack with those numbers!
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:21:48
Probably. You may not hit the exact bottom, but you won't regret it in 5 years
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:29:39
Many people did that at 20k and got absolutely destroyed. I think it is a terrible idea, BUT if there was a time to do it, it would be after a huge drop like this. Be willing to ride it to 0 though. If you can't afford the mortgage, don't do it.
@_date: 2018-11-24 08:12:53
My prediction has been 2500 for several months. A few days ago, now that the patterns are nearing completion, I am moving my prediction to 3100. Give or take a bit. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:27:46
That's not how exchanges work. The price of bitcoin is irrelevant to them
@_date: 2018-11-02 03:23:50
I do it all. Crypto, metals, stocks, forex. crypto has the fastest moves so it is the most profitable
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:52:43
It isnt enough money to hold some. I will be able to match the amount in the next 6 months as I save
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:26:18
I see 850 as a potential bottom. I am getting a new job and I'm prepared to put some extra income in all the way down
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:38:13
Challenge accepted
@_date: 2018-11-24 03:03:49
Nobody would buy at 100k because of the buy wall. It is guaranteed to go down from there so few orders would work out
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:04:04
Ah I see. A double negative because there will be a bull run
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:32:32
Lol in this market, nobody is ever sure. The risk/reward ratio is amazing though. I'm gonna keep buying till 0, or recovery! Worst case I lose the small amount I put in. Best case, 150x or even more
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:25:26
There will be prejudices on both sides. Some hate bitcoin for the wrong reasons. Some love it for the wrong reasons. If people get overly defensive on either side, they probably aren't confident on why they believe what they do. I personally believe in Blockchain, but not Bitcoin in the long term
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:48:58
Honestly you are too late to level your own emotions. It took me 6 months of trading such an insignificant amount, it meant nothing to me. I then  had to spend 6 months building up till I could trade my full portfolio with low emotion. If you aren't to that point, you just gotta trust those that are thinking straight. If you can't afford lost it all, pull out. If you already can't afford how much you lost, might as well stick it out. If you can afford to lose it, the risk/reward ratio is amazing right now. It will probably be a year before full recovery though. Last bear market ended after a full year of sideways. With those factors in mind, I wish you luck!
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:27:12
It is also at the 75% correction line. It has a few reasons to be a support 
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:28:11
Trying to get an idea of how many people would be interested in this. If I were to offer to buy anything online, and have it shipped to people in exchange for cryptocurrency, how many would consider it? Benefits for you: you could directly pay for something with BTC, and no attachment to your name, so you can avoid the capital gains tax (if there is any left at this point XD ) You also won't have to wait for a withdrawal to go through before ordering something. On the down side, it would require people trusting an online stranger because there is no way to regulate it. I would benefit because I could create wallets not attached directly to my name, and maybe charge a small fee for picking up the item you want. I could even go to stores and pick things up for shipping out. Is this something anybody would consider, or is it a bad idea because it kind of comes off like a scam?
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:46:59
Lol he is doing just fine. Told me to sell out at 17k and I didn't. He has lost close to nothing
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:54:45
It could reasonably go as low as $2500,  And maybe a quick drop to $1000 for a few moments. Anything below that is a bad sign for crypto in general. Note that it may not go that low. That is just my lowest estimate
@_date: 2018-11-17 00:33:11
Permabulls always downvote this stuff. Lol. I see 2-3k as well. I'm not complaining though. It will over double the profit potential
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:18:37
Only introduce someone if they can survive a lot more down action. I still see a year of bear ahead
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:28:45
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:06:02
I only bet what I am willing to lose in crypto because I am willing to accept I could be wrong. Too many people bet too much in hope, and give up right as the opportunity is in front of them
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:30:07
I'm considering buying a rig from somebody giving up on Bitcoin. It is less worth it short term. More worth it long term at the moment. You will receive more BTC, but less cash value
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:34:29
Eventually the tech may develop to work as a currency. In it's current state it cannot. Right now it is running closer to a decentralized stock market

Technically you can do both. You can even build government agencies on blockchain. It is a very versatile technology. If the internet was remade around blockchain, the level of security and privacy would be amazing. Never place limits on the types of things technology can be adapted for
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:30:19
Just to be fair. This is a way better time to do it than at over 10k XD but yes bad idea overall
@_date: 2018-11-24 08:27:34
Where do you think it will drop to?
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:41:27
Im up 10k at the moment, but down 10k in the bear market. I was up 20k before the crash
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:14:42
Thinking about it
@_date: 2018-11-24 02:45:07
About 3k is my projected bottom, and it looks like it will hit sooner than I thought. 15k this year would be nice, but it may take a year or two to hit it
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:23:21
I have major supports drawn around 5300, 4300, 2500, and 1k is my last one before I get worried. I think 2500 makes a lot of sense as a bottom. 4k as well, but I don't think 4k will hold. 1k would make me happy if it holds and begins recovering. That will multiply profit potential.
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:31:53
I will be putting more than 25k in this year XD
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:16:23

They don't unless it is directly stated. Fees would be declared if there are any. Typically they make money off of the trades back and forth between people on the exchange
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:53:01
Worldwide cash value is around $80 trillion. If bitcoin truly takes off and becomes a worldwide currency it would rival that value split between 21 million bitcoin. Theoretically that puts bitcoin at a max of 3.8 million in current U.S. dollar value assuming everybody were to use it. It isn't linear though. Value is created and lost, and prices change. As things get cheaper, that value has more buying power. There are also lost bitcoins to take into account as well as an infinite amount of factors that could move the potential.
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:47:38
I did. I believe cryptocurrency can't be stopped, and has potential to destroy nearly every world power out there that cannot convince people to donate willingly. As a libertarian this is very important to me
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:26:03
I have a handy silver chart for you. It may help you understand the concept of NOT selling at the exact bottom when all you have done is matched inflation. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 08:58:29
Note... if they only accept bitcoin it is likely a scam. Make sure to ask around before throwing money at something you aren't familiar with. If you are just buying drugs you are fine

Obviously we have vastly different strategies. I like to buy low, sell high. Probably a foreign concept to you. I had all my reasoning typed out, and unfortunately accidentally closed reddit... you aren't worth typing it out twice, but if you genuinely want to know my reasoning, I will answer if you ask
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:45:19
So about 1 million bitcoin purchased? All at once it would have a wick spike up to like a million, then back down to like 10k probably. Staggered over a day it would quickly move up to around 10k
@_date: 2018-12-13 15:04:29
I saw that same quote applied to the stock market today. After a whopping 12% drop from ATH XD I guarantee we are a lot closer to bottom than stocks are

Which means the cost of mining is likely lower than expected

@_date: 2018-12-11 17:58:55
Nice. I'm betting on 300k, but not till 2025. The majority scaling in the last year or two
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:29:41
It has nothing to do with actual location. Governments or agencies could indirectly track you though on two conditions. First off, the wallet address needs to be linked to your identity directly. For instance, you entered cryptocurrency through an exchange that requires identity verification. Secondly, they would need the resources to link your name to your location. Access to government records would be the most likely way, though there are others. Anybody without access to your address records couldn't find you. And anybody who couldn't link your name to the wallet adress couldn't find you
@_date: 2018-12-16 10:55:22
Well... they booted me off so they lost my business :P
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:55:15
This last crash brought knowledge of bitcoins existance to the general population. Everybody knows it crashed. Once it recovers everybody in the entire population will be aware of a full cycle. That will bring trust to crypto among the general population. This tech will change the world

@_date: 2018-12-03 15:12:49
Volume over the last 24 hours was about $175,000,000 worth of bitcoin. It would take 43,000 people putting in 4k each to throw the cycle off by one day. Sellers would also see it as overbought, and dampen the effect more. You would have better odds running a pump and dump on a low volume coin. Even then it is risky
@_date: 2018-12-25 17:37:40
4k. I have another 2500 to throw in later as well 
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:11:22
