Comms101. You have a representative available, and on message. If the entire team were here all day, they wouldn't have the bandwidth to make progress. Give it time.

I'm sure that you're hearing this from many others in management too, but please do act decisively here. You're in control of a seemingly uncontrollable situation due to your dedication to the community over the last 30 hours, but the longer this drags on without some/most getting access to funds, the more dire things tend to become. Thanks for all of your work thus far, and here's to a resolution!

Are you still "leaning this way", or are you now leaning a different way?
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:42:09
Would the plan for withdrawals be announced as planned today regardless?
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:53:40
Can you guarantee that those in currencies (LTC/ETH/ETC) unaffected and confirmed to be safe and held by Bitfinex in full will receive their funds back in due time?
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:48:11
Yeah, just a +1 here. You could be the only one here coming out looking like a hero...
Keeping our collective fingers crossed for some good news.

FYI, I'm invested, and feel strongly that the involvement of suits does holders more harm than good. Once the lawyers get in, the 36% will only grow. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:28:15
Thanks for all that you're doing. Please do your best to keep your head above the fray and to ignore things like the other unnecessary response to your comment below. You're the only lifeline here for thousands of us, and we appreciate your constant presence here. Keep it up. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:23:46
Will access to those funds be provided in due time? 
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:02:35
For my note on minority/majority, another user pointed out that it was likely about half of BTC based on a comparison to the last time their total was made known, but when you factor for **0% of USD, 0% of ETH, 0% of ETC, 0% of LTC stolen**, we're all but assuredly looking at a minority of users
And again, you **must** give BFX a change to enact a plan to assist those robbed before demanding that and team *punish* all users. 
Do you really think that legal processes wouldn't take place by more people if the users not affected were told they'd suffer *after confirming that they weren't effected*. 
What's obvious here is that they're working on making it right. Give peace a damn chance, please. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:24:22
You aren't helping the situation, on the contrary. Have a good night. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:07:59
Yeah, they've had one update per day officially. Today's should be the biggest yet. Fingers crossed, hands held!
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:41:42
"...Our plan to launch withdrawals...". I'm at work and literally just threw up with a sense of relief. Thank you. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:31:26
What's the likely outcome here though? Someone files an injunction to get 100% of funds back for non BTC wallets? Don't the BTC hodlers then counter to force bankruptcy and we all lose? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:51:43
This needs to be answered. BFX is dipping into the companies profits over the last few years, and putting how much toward users?
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:27:27
You've confirmed that other currencies were unaffected. Do you have an initial timeline or even a ballpark as to when access will be restored? 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:39:56
This comment reads like a viagra testimonial. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:53:42
It's been nine hours. People have slept, and it's the afternoon UTC. You have to be able to say something right now. Announcement at Xpm, something. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:23:44
Can any announcement regarding withdrawal be made with respect for time zone differences?
For example, 10AM EST would still have most in China and most in Europe awake, whereas othertimes might be the middle of the night for most?
I'd expect the traffic to be very heavy upon an open... Thanks.

This has been said before, and I'll counterpoint it again. If the vast majority of accounts are not effected by this hack, and BFX can develop a plan to aid those who were attacked, then "socializing", where BFX moves funds out of the segregated wallets of 100% of users could be a bigger story than the hack itself, and to think that that situation would be *free of legal trouble* would be comical.
To the user above, let and the BFX team try to resolve the situation for everyone **without** dragging the entire community into the pit when most are unaffected, just to make those hurt the worst feel a little better in the short term.

It's a self funding rebate system. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 18:10:26
Oh no! Ethereum support? Attack!
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:14:21
OH! We are FinTRAC certified as a NON-MSB, even after the Direct Sale pitch. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 01:13:45
We have code for processing direct sale of coins, and for pulling exchange rates, as well as some educational material etc. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:24:13
Preferred accounts? The main players in core/mining powerhouses? 
@_date: 2016-05-27 13:33:15
Is there any sourcing to this at all? If this were true you'd see a 100$ price spike by day's end...
