As long as the volatility stays so high, price will be set in another currency most places even if payed in bitcoins.
For someone accepting bitcoins that wants to minimize risk due to price change, systems like bitpay can automatically sell most or all of the bitcoins received for other currencies. 
That means bitcoin can function as a means of exchange and a speculative investments, even if it is not a unit of account or reliable store of value.

If it is a standard fee you can change the fee in the options of the standard bitcoin client. If you lower the fee too far it could take a long time to confirm.
If you received a very large number of very small transactions you may need to split your transfer into more than one transaction.
If some of the bitcoins involved in the transfer have very recently been moved you should wait an hour or so and try again.

While I agree now is not a good time to invest in mining hardware, sale price vs mining revenue is not the only important factor. 
The time to earn that money is also important. The revenue from the first batch may be needed to pay for the second batch.
The company may be able to earn more by selling several batches of mining hardware rather than just holding onto and mining with the first batch.

If you send a transaction with bitcoin-qt that is less then your total balance, the change from the transaction will be sent to a newly created bitcoin address. This can result in your bitcoins being spread over several different bitcoin addresses. This is no problem because funds from more than one address can be combine into one transaction but can make it harder to figure out your total balance, using other means.

Bitcoin-QT, electrum, and armory are all local wallets. Bitcoins are always online it is the private keys that let you spend your bitcoins that can be online or off.
Any encryption would do I tend to use truecrypt for encrypting backups.

If you have been actively using the same wallet both on blockchain and bitcoin-qt, they may have become out of sync with each containing addresses the the other does not.
Pick one and create a new address, send all the bitcoin visible to the other wallet to that new address. After that use separate wallets in QT and blockchain.

I think paper wallets are over rated. The important thing it to have multiple backups not connected to the internet. The storage medium is fairly unimportant. 
If you are concerned about physical theft I think a encrypted usb thumb drive is the better option. 2-4 thumb drives in a home safe plus 2-4 in a safety deposit box should protect you both from hardware failure and theft.
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:19:35
I don't know about armory specifically but the default client, creates 100 key pairs when first run. New key pairs are created as previous ones are used. 
The point of this is so that a backup does not become outdated every time you send coins or receive them at a new address.

It depends on where your bitcoins were stored. If you left them at an exchange all you need is a username and password.
If you had them in a local wallet, you need the hard drive of the old computer. The file you need is located in (on Win7)
C:\Users\ [your user name] \AppData\roaming\bitcoin\ 
and is called wallet.dat
If you can get that file: install a new copy of the wallet software and copy that file to the same location on the new computer.

My layman's understanding is that if you are a miner and you sell bitcoins  directly to a customer for other currency's (Bitcoin OTC, Ebay, etc) you are subject to the regulations, but if you use an exchange you are not.

Just a bit of trivia but: While we know the maximum amount of bitcoins that will ever exist we do not know the minimum. A miner can choose to create less new bitcoins than the normal block reward or even none at all when creating a block. This has in fact happened at least once already.

Saying bitcoin has no value is like saying Windows 7 has no value(after all microsoft can create as many copies of windows 7 as they want). If there are economic transactions that can be done cheaper because of bitcoin then bitcoin does have fundamental value. Bitcoin is a tool and what can be done with it gives it value.
That value may be above or below the value implied by the market price but it does exist.

Unless a majority of miners decide to reject any block containing transactions to or from the "evil" address, It only takes one miner to prevent the freezing of an address.
If miners did try to reject such blocks it would be disruptive to the network as a whole and as such financially painful for the miners.
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:46:39
It's been awhile since I have done any mining and I don't remember what the reasoning was but it could very well have just been a play it safe sort of thing. 
But I think it comes down to creation versus pay, if you grow wheat you owe takes when you sell it, if you received wheat as part of your pay you would owe taxes on its value at the time you received it.
At a minimum any bitcoins a miner got from transaction fees would have to be viewed as pay rather than creation. Also any miner participating in a mining pool is more receiving pay than creating something since they can get bitcoins without ever finding a block themselves.

Make several encrypted backups of your wallet whatever you do.

The amount of computing power used for mining only changes the rate at which bitcoins are created briefly. As soon as the next 1 or 2 difficulty changes occur the rate gets back to normal.

generaly because they don't intend to pay at all just file a dispute and get their money back after the bitcoins are delivered

A zero confirmation bitcoin transaction can be trusted at least as much as a check can be. If you are worried about fraud you ask for ID so you know who to go after if there is a double spend.

I am not a lawyer or other expert but from my 2 years of learning about bitcoin this is my understanding:
The value of your bitcoins at the time you mine them is standard income. You need to declare that income and pay taxes on it even if you don't sell your bitcoins.
The value of your bitcoins at the time you sell them minus the value when mined them is capitol gains.
If you sell your bitcoins directly to customers you need to register as a Money Service Business unless you fall under one of the exceptions.
If you sell your bitcoins on a exchange you do not need to register.

Just pay the damn taxes.

Either could be correct, it will just come down to which becomes the common usage. The 's' seems to be winning so far.

I have heard of similar happening with a hand crafted transaction. Any bitcoins included in a transaction that do not have a destination listed become part of the miners fee.

You should never have just one copy of your wallet. But when dealing with very large sums it is best to never have it in a unencrypted form on anything but a dedicated machine.

collateral, you might not be able to seize bitcoins but you can seize a house or car.

After 100 transactions you need to make new backups.

There have been several attempts to do just that already. For a bitcoin clone to beat bitcoin it does not need to be just a bit better it must be much much better. This is because the more people that use it the more useful it is. So even a slightly better version of bitcoin with fewer users is overall worse than bitcoin.

The weekend dip is most reliable when people are buying bitcoins as soon as their money hits the exchange. The less idle cash sitting on exchanges the more effect the lack of new bank transfers has on the price.

Perhaps some one just noticed they are a millionaire on paper and wants 1/3 of it to play with.

Mining difficulty is not pre-set it adjusts based on how fast bitcoins are mined. When more computing power is added we get ahead of schedule then difficult automatically goes up to compensate and we get back on track for the last coin being mined in 2140.
If the amount computing power goes down because miners quit when profits fall difficulty will go down to compensate.

As an imperfect workaround you can send transactions that are larger than the average size you were receiving but smaller than the one that required the fee to another address you own as a way to consolidate smaller transactions.
It would be a slow process (if you don't pay and transaction fee) that might take several iterations before you can send the original transaction you wanted to make without a required fee.

All you **need** is the wallet.dat. But moving the block chain data will save you from needing to download it all again.

Bitcoin is still too complicated with too many potential pitfalls to be suitable for anyone that is not self motivated to learn more about how it works.
If you promote it to someone who is not going to go off and spend the time to learn how it works you are just got to end up costing them money as they lose their wallet or have their bitcoins stolen.

Accepting a 0 confirmation bitcoin transaction is less risky than taking a check. If you feel at risk for double spends ask for ID.

If you can monitor all traffic to an ip address you can tell if a specific bitcoin transaction originated at that ip.

Well it is certainly not a ponzi scheme because ponzi scheme involves a scammer claiming to have secret investing techniques that will make a great deal of profit.
With bitcoin every detail of how the system works is publicly available information since the software is open source. Further more there is no promise of profit.
Bitcoins price is determined by market forces alone. If more people want to buy than want to sell prices go up until less want to buy or more want to sell. If more want to sell the price goes down.
Bitcoin is still very experimental any number of things could cause people to lose faith and a crash in the price.
However the price is not yet high enough to support the volume of transactions seen by other methods of exchange so there is room for the price to go up.

The days of GPU mining are gone. The mining market is so overly competitive at the moment that hardware manufactures are the only ones making decent money.

A double spend is essentially the bounced check of the bitcoin world.
Some one sends you bitcoins gets something in return quickly and then sends the very same bitcoins to themselves. If they succeed then the second transaction is the one that becomes the true one and you are left with neither bitcoins nor the sold item.
 Doing so is easy but not reliable at 0 confirmations. Doing so becomes infeasible very quickly as more confirmations arrive.

The backbone of bitcoin is the block chain. The block chain is a history of all bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin miners add to the block chain. This process is intentionally hard so that it is very difficult to rewrite history. Bitcoin miners are awarded bitcoins so that someone is willing to do that hard work. 
Every block is linked to the block before it, and the longest chain of blocks is accepted as the official version. So if you want to change history you need to be able create new blocks faster then everyone else combined.

Thanks that one worked for me.

There is way to much mining competition at the moment. It may make sense to get into mining at some point in the future but that day is not today.
