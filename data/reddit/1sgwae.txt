Can u change the downvote to be going up with a smaller slope?
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:19:12
Maybe their good with numbers, and dont abuse thier power so much.
Useful figureheads which are good talking points for conspiracy theorists, while the shadier things are kept on the downlow.

It makes everyone elses bitcoin worth more since they will have to rebuy.
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:47:20
You know they sell rc lambos for 10 dollars.
I can't afford the batteries though. Should've invested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-30 04:16:59
For every dollar bitcoin drops from now until 2021 (inclusive), I will eat one jizz.

If warren buffet had purchased 10 million in bitcoin 7 years ago, he would probably be the richest man in the world today. 
How many bitcoins he have today? 0? How many coins us smart bois have?
Thats what I thought.

inb4 anyone claims bitocin doesn't hold value, 1 bitcoin will always be worth 1 bitcoin.

Bitcoin is valuated at 40k-1million per coin according to people in the know on youtube, and twutter.
@_date: 2018-06-11 02:43:04
Who was talking about fiat, man that sht wont mean anything when a bitcoin worth billions one day.
@_date: 2018-06-06 01:34:30
Well if the community agrees to it, we could increase the limit on maximum amount of bitcoins. 
Maybe create a fork for developing countries tied to fiat. Have bitcoin be the official standard of US/EURO.
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:16:42
No im saying when you do need to pull out your gains, should attempt to do so before others peaks. When bitcoin was hitting 20k, you shouldve sold at 15-17k. The amount of coins sold at 20k+ was probably negligable.

Chill with the fud. 
If you have to question anything about bitcoin, then bitcoin probably isn't for you.
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:56:17
What about version control on blockchain?
@_date: 2018-06-19 14:35:48
Well you gotta be slightly ahead of the herd. Because as soon as too people want to cash out at peak, the price is going to drop hard. 
Its similar with the stock market, but way more dramatic in a low volume trading system like newer markets.
Sell right before the tip, else exchanges will crash, or take time to "cool off"
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:14:20
Wasnt there some newer device thats better than current bitmain devices for only 2.5k?
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:15:24
20 mins later, and its at 11k.
Buy, buy, buy!
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:39:31
Huh. its down to 7.6k. Wonder if its a fuzzing algorithim. Or spike from elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:07:41
That means 75k worth of bitcoin need to be bought every 10 minutes, and 11 million needs to be bought per day. This can't be right?
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:11:36
Look like lower range of the last two digits, is 09, and upper range is 85. I just ate  and hour ago, so I think next week will be good.
@_date: 2018-06-12 01:06:40
They lashing out because they afraid. 
Look at these feeble attempts to protect fiat.

Keys use a secure hashing algorithm. Its not garunteed to be secure forever.
Why bare minimun encryption is increased every so often.

My salary is 70k, actually its 60k, actually its 30k, actually its 300k.

take out a mortgage, or sell my house. Have a million after tax, buy bitcoin at 7k each, wait for 19+k, while living on the streets, or shelter for 5 years. End up with a guaranteed 2 million return, for a 2x? return.
I like it.

lol that domainname.

I live in major city in nicer part of town. Allows me to commute to work in 10 minutes one way.  Two spot garage because I suck at parking. 4 bathrooms for one person is pretty nice. Piss in whichever one I'm closest too.
Living in apartment by yourself is only 2k cheaper per month, and you don't even get a forth of what I have.

Shipping, parts, labor, and overhead is probably more than buying a brand new computer.

Its really easy to increase value when you start at early point. North Korea can have 10000% increase in gdp from a international cargo ship sailing along its boarders. You can average that out to be 1000% increase YoY. 
Beanie babies went up some ridiculously amount too, but can this **hodl**?  Look at MTGOX bankruptcy sales of a few bitcoins crashing the markets. I feel bitcoin is still propped up by the 2.3 billion in tether printouts.
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:26:57
Just use fiat for purchases now, and bitcoin for your retirement account.
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:59:59
If they had inbested in bitcoin, this wouldnt be a problem.
@_date: 2018-06-07 04:07:08
6200 invested in stock market over that period would be 16500 (about 5.6% return if you invested in middle of 1999 right in middle of stock market rebound). If you spent 833 per year on repairs/maintenance, than total amount in brokerage account would be 42000.
In this situation, your investment would have kept up with inflation. Not bad to drive a nice looking, 44 year old car for free.
If you had invested in early part of 1999, and/or most of the maintence costs were recent, then you'd have beat inflation.

The majority of the bitcoin miners, core devs, and owners
I think if someone can crack the key, the coins could be accessed.
@_date: 2018-07-16 12:07:18
Advertisment is another benefit even with no purchases.
Maybe its owned by those cartels, and helps identify people for kidnapping, extortion, and murder.

Is thia what is forcing rhe price to be stable?

"No user funds were affected". Whats to worry about then?
