I think a sovereign nation adopting it as recognized currency is a possible catalyst.

Two hours after posting your question, USA Today posted an article discussing exactly this: [Stockman accepts Bitcoin donations, but FEC doesn't](
The FEC is currently deadlocked on whether BTC donations are acceptable.
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:10:03
Good.  Please do follow up with [your promise to donate everything past 2.26052786 BTC](
Although it would be breaking the promise to donate all ~20 coins to I really agree with post [asking for the Bitcoin donation wealth to be spread around a bit](  There are so many other charities in desperate need.
Personally, I would like to see you donate the 6.7 BTC to top off the [SeansOutpost donation drive to have Jason shave his beard]( and then the remaining to some of the other charities listed in that post.

FYI, you can see the transactions above here:
Props to for sending you 0.11 BTC (~$11.47USD) to a random stranger, and to you for sending it back.

Great to hear! Didn't work two weeks ago when I tried.

$1,000USD/mBTC would literally be the headline value of $1 Million/BTC.
That's a total market cap of over 12 Trillion USD.
I don't think the moon would suffice, more like to Alpha Centuri.
@_date: 2013-11-09 10:01:10
Or you could view it as: you can still send 1.00000001 BTC, but you cant send 1.000000001 BTC.

From the 'formatting help' tab below the comment box: "Lines starting with four spaces

In other words, they are not subject to markdown.

Kudos to Coinbase for resolving the issue so quickly.
I've noticed in general they tend to over-state how long until a transaction will take and deliver in well under their stated time (at least when going from Bitcoin -&gt; Bank accountt).

Ah reddit never ceases to amaze me.  Someone who is begging with a sign gets 0.001, while a random comment gets 50 times that amount.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:44:37
C'mon, don't [you]( have millions of BTC laying around?
@_date: 2013-11-10 09:07:01
Well, it hasn't been approved yet, but I posted a proposition to bitbet.us: ["1 BTC will surpass price of 1 Troy Oz of Gold in USD by Nov 1, 2014"](
edit: [The bet is now active](

Awesome!  Now my wife can start using bitcoin!  She won't use any app unless it runs on her iPhone...

A whopping 0.0 BTC received 9 hours later:
Reddit is fickle to say the least.

Sorry to hear that -- I hope it wasn't much. I lost the 0.01 BTC that inputs.io gave me when I signed up.
I'm of the opinion it was all a big scam plan from the beginning to pull exactly this sort of theft.
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:57:06
You're lucky to have gotten your BTC out of inputs.io!
@_date: 2013-10-28 23:17:04
So who was the lucky winner?  The graph indicates 499922 wallets... which means 500,000 must have been reached by now.

As much as a believer in Bitcoin I am, I have a hard time believing it will ever reach the same value as the [entire world yearly GDP of 71.83 Trillion USD](
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:34:40
Sorry, but I think you're overshooting quite a bit.
The entire Money Supply (M2) of USD is around $11.5 trillion 
At $2 MM per Bitcoin, market cap would be $24 trillion (using current # of BTC of ~12 MM) .
While I believe in BTC, I have a hard time believing it will supplant the worlds reserve currency entirely twice over.

Yup, this guy is legitimate. Kudos on figuring out how to import your private key and sign a message in Electrum!

Two months ago, the spouse and I went to [a Japanese Steakhouse](  The other couple at the table was from LA and the woman was a credit card transaction processor.  After hearing that I immediately asked "do you know about Bitcoin?"  She had not, but I spent the rest of the meal talking about it.  She seemed quite interested -- especially in the no chargebacks aspect.
Not quite the same synchronicity with the other members at the table as your story, but it discussing Bitcoin at a Japanese Steakhouse was definitely a familiar story to me :)

You tell *me* to stop complaining then call me an unthankful human being?  Wow.
I wasn't complaining.  I found it funny and was just trying to point out some irony...

When I introduce Bitcoin to someone new and they ask "But... what can I buy with bitcoin?" I always respond first with "Gyft.com! You can buy a gift card with bitcoin on your phone right in the store before you use it!"
Gyft is providing a *very valuable service* to the BTC community bridging the gap between the bitcoin network and the major retailer's current payment systems.
I applaud your contribution and use your service regularly -- well, not as much as I should as I tend to horde my BTC :) ; but Gyft definitely makes it easier to spend them.
I also hope one day soon you get Apple to allow purchases of cards with BTC inside your iOS app.  That would be killer.
