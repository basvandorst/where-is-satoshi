I'll buy some more when it dips below 11k i guess
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:14:21
I hope 8,5k but wouldn't be surprised if it bounces back close to 9k either
@_date: 2019-07-15 06:05:04
I guess I'm buying again if it reaches about 8,5k
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:27:51
Seems like the dip is officially over. Congratulations to all of the big dick people who bought the dip!
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:47:23
So pants down now: Who of you sold for below 10k?
@_date: 2019-07-02 16:14:04
What do you guys think will be the new ATH at this years bull run?
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:22:43
Because there are many newbies investing in Bitcoin. They panic sell once it goes down a bit which causes other newbies to panic sell and so on
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:10:43
I think prices will stay around 10k for a few days until the bull run continues. It seems to be that many people think it's going to 8k first before a climb to a new ATH but usually Bitcoin goes against what the majority thinks it will do. However i will just hold as usual and buy a bit more during dips
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:04:30
Will be better again tomorrow after the weak hands are out (probably they will buy back higher though)
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:09:04
If you got some spare money. I just bought some more for under 10200
@_date: 2019-07-11 02:42:03
I think we will pass 14k after this dip
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:17:28
It will be up fast usually after the dip. No time to wait until it goes back up, better buy on the way down
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:54:28
No worries, bull run will probably continue after a few days of consolidation. Whats happening now seems to be quite normal considering the price shot up too quickly last wednesday. I guess it reminded many about 2017
@_date: 2019-07-09 10:36:18
Dude the price is still much higher than yesterday
@_date: 2019-07-02 16:02:35
So did you buy it back? How much did you lose?
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:42:53
We are back boys!
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:50:36
Still waiting for 8,5k to buy more
@_date: 2019-07-21 14:43:21
Nice research bro
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:56:45
I know how you feel. I invested a lot during the dip after december 2017, but eventually bitcoin always goes back up again
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:14:24
Nice dip bros. Just bought some more. Damn lucky me that i sold my altcoins 2 months ago
@_date: 2019-07-14 09:42:44
What do you guys think how much lower it will go?
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:30:46
I would hope so too if I sold my Bitcoin. Lets see
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:13:10
Hope you take it as a lesson not to sell during dips
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:32:49
Hard to hit the peak i guess. Hope you're not at a loss now. I think this bullrun is about Bitcoin, thats why I don't want to be invested in any other coin
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:43:54
What matters in the end is getting more Bitcoin before halvening in 10 months
@_date: 2019-07-14 09:47:28
Don't think thats happening anytime soon. The road until 20k will be a rocky one with many pullbacks on the way. After that the masses will probably jump on the  bandwagon again
@_date: 2019-07-14 10:21:32
No reason to get offensive though
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:01:36
It tested below 10k twice now. Seems like we bottomed out
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:07:24
Hello Bitcoin community. I plan to invest 5 million Euros (I am from germany) of my savings into Bitcoin and want to make use of this dip. Do you think it will dip lower again soon or should i invest now? It's a serious question and not meant as a joke. Thanks in advance
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:13:00
Thank you for the advice. I just bought some for 11500 and will keep track of the chart to buy more
