And what exactly do you think is going to do it?  Years of people doing what I wrote.  But you like to dismiss things you can't pull together and just pretend "something else makes sense...  I just don't know what it is".  
  
A lot like the patient with a broken finger telling the doctor everything hurts but its not her finger.  
  
I've got tons of crypto and usd, so unless you can prove you've accomplished more than me, I'm just dismissing you as a typical internet troll avoiding real life because you suck at it.

It's how currency is established and why this is jittery.  It'll take time to adopt and level out, but it'll be because real estate does this, that it begins to level.

Buy property and list it ONLY rentable in bitcoin, but establish a flat mBTC rate per day/week/month, instead of saying "$1500 but I accept btc".  
  
BTC will take off if someone that holds a lot can build an ecosystem with an exchange rate of coin, not comparing to USD

I was reading with all the fees, hacks, fraud, and mistakes that the available Bitcoin pool is reaching 0, which would previously make the supply demand ratio good for sellers but it's unknown what that means for buyer demand knowing it's technically dying.

Its just a matter of using their bank account for direct deposit.

Actually gave in and tried the BTM, complete waste of time.  
Only had $100 limit, had misspellings on the instructions, then best of all, did nothing.  I tried the $100 thinking I might have to do a bunch, scanned, paid, waited 5 minutes where it timed out.  
It was in the blockchain but still nothing.  
To top it off it was out of receipt paper and gave no electronic receipt or anything to come back and pick up the money.  Had to talk to the manager of Ketchup to get a support number, support basically told me to wait, wait fucking 30 minutes, I just left.  I ended up getting a refund like 4 hours later.  
Complete waste of time.
