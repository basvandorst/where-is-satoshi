These two do not go together.
An altcoin that is piggybacking off of another project's infrastructure and reputation isn't worth considering.  Shady business.  
Respectable altcoins have their own blockchain, and forums for that matter.

Lightning is by all rights an altcoin. 
That they try to profit from the bitcoin name, when having nothing to do with it, is shady business.
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:44:47
Larger max block size is in no way good for the average bitcoin user.
It *is* good for further centralizing mining power, something that needs to be avoided with extreme prejudice. That will benefit only a few already powerful players, to the detriment of the rest of us.
@_date: 2016-08-02 09:44:36
As of today, there is yet no need.
Yes, optimizations. Better use of bandwidth with the current max block size.  Actually a decrease in block size would be very useful. It promotes the "average Joe"'s mining endeavors.
We've already seen far too much mining power centralization, and this is a huge threat. Larger block size increases the chances of a 51% attack, something that would be disastrous to bitcoin.
We need to promote the little guy getting back into things, not cater to already wealthy conglomerates.
The bitcoin dev team has been working on this, and many other things, safely, sanely, carefully, for quite a while now. There is no DOOM! Scenario.
Side note: crap like "lightningcoin", "classiccoin" and other fly-by-night operations, piggybacking on bitcoin's infrastructure for personal profit, are to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
If they seek any crumb of respectability, they would offer *actual* competition as a proper altcoin (own blockchain, and forums for that matter). If theirs is better, people will use it.
@_date: 2016-08-02 09:33:08
What?  


(emphasis added for clarity)
Increasing max block size will encourage *further* centralization.
It benefits large wealthy players, but is very bad for the average Joe, and bitcoin in general.
We need to be *very* careful. There are already large and powerful players that would love to hijack or destroy bitcoin's infrastructure for their own gain.
We've had way too much spamming of nonsense like increasing block size willy-nilly, with no protections in place. These ideas are either woefully misinformed or just so much more propaganda and astroturfing from scam artists.
Actaully, not even "artists", because their mumbo-jumbo is very easy to see through, especially after they have non-stop spammed this and other serious bitcoin forums with their abusive propaganda.
Sad thing that some do buy that snake oil, but fortunately, this and other bitcoin forums know what's really up.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.

What, you think it's ok to just let any and all altcoins use bitcoin's blockchain?
To each their own blockchain, that is how altcoins work. If for some strange reason there was a project that invited multiple, incompatible currencies on the same blockchain, fine.
This is not how bitcoin is made, and other projects hijacking bitcoin's blockchain for their own is completely disgusting behavior. Worthy of extreme disrespect that it shows.
@_date: 2016-08-20 20:51:12
ohhh.. "popular" alt?  You're talking about that cesspool.
Yah ok, coinbase supporting that idiocy says it all.
and by "blocksize" we can assume you mean they are fully for increasing it immediately, with no protections in place to protect against even further mining power centralization. 
We've seen such crap from get-rich-quick scam artists all too often. No wonder the name was familiar. :(
@_date: 2016-08-02 10:50:45
It is not a "belief", it is simply common knowledge.

The question stands, and it is an important one:
Can you transfer Lightningcoin, Thundercoin, Classiccoin alt coins to a bona fide bitcoin wallet?
*IF* that was possible, could you then use them as standard bona fide bitcoins, from an official wallet?
No, these altcoins are *incompatible*. They have nothing to do with bitcoin. 
They are their own cryptocurrencies, and they'd be better off to advertise as such. 
Altcoins and competition are a good thing.
Trying to affiliate your altcoin so closely with bitcoin is a despicable practice, 
and to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
@_date: 2016-08-14 08:27:48
They do absolutely nothing for bitcoin. By all rights, they run an altcoin. Just an unscrupulous one that disingenuously piggybacks on the already established infrastructure of another project.
They have no right affiliating themselves with bitcoin at all. The two are incompatible. Shady business all around.

oh god, give us a break.  As if you have a clue what you're talking about. 
We understand "game theory" and have had way too many spammers spreading total disinformation here lately.
We're rather tired of it. The hostility and destructiveness is in no way from serious bitcoin / cryptocurrency enthusiatsts, but from some get-rich-quick scam artists with large corporate funding to spread such ridiculous propaganda.
People here ARE aware of the truth, and that is that upping max block size indiscriminately, with no protections against even further centralization, is ridiculous.
Ain't gonna happen, was never any chance in hell of a hard fork to do that, no matter how much spam and disinformation is spewed by dishonest scammers.
@_date: 2016-08-30 20:17:02
Altcoins are good.  We all share the same internet.
The bitcoin blockchain, name, and bitcoins themselves are taken though.
These altcoins, lightning, classic, all the various scam artists trying to affiliate themselves with bitcoin are completely disreputable.
There are plenty of legitimate altcoins, that respectfully represent themselves as what they really are. This is a prerequisite for taking them seriously, at all.
@_date: 2016-08-14 12:52:53
This is not a question as, again, blockstream does nothing to help bitcoin.
Can you use blockstream to send bitcoins to a bona fide bitcoin client?  If not, then it is not bitcoin, it is an altcoin, and needs its own blockchain, and forums for that matter.
The "value" they are creating for *themselves* does not help bitcoin, only themselves.
@_date: 2016-08-01 12:55:33
Not in the least. There are other, much better methods. 
Optimization is FAR better than just brutally upping max block size with zero protections.
@_date: 2016-08-01 10:04:33
Agree except for the ridiculous "case" for willy-nilly increasing block size.
Actually, max block size is too big as it is. There will never be a hard fork just for increasing this, no matter how loud all the propaganda scam artists scream. There is zero contention there.
@_date: 2016-08-30 20:14:22


What are you on about?  
Altcoins advertising as having something to do with bitcoin is completely disreputable.
IF they had anything to offer, they'd not be so shady about it.

This and other spam threads like it are full of people being paid to vote. Sock puppets galore. We've seen it all a million times. 
The sad thing is, newbies to cryptocurrency are victimized by the shameless disinformation and propaganda. Still, it's easy to see what's going on. 
Usually there is no intelligent argument. The "conversation" quickly descends into silly shaming attempts and downright shit slinging (as seen so clearly above).
"Useful idiots" is what the scam artists call their victims. People that buy into the bullshit. Thankfully, the armies of sock puppets are seen strongest in posts like this that have nothing to do with bitcoin.
Still, it is a problem, just as Lighningcoin, Classiccoin, and all the other disingenuous altcoin projects are.

@_date: 2016-08-12 14:09:15


Your entire post there boils down to 3 assertions of yours, the rest are simply straw men arguments (as seen above). Rather abusive ones. Stop that.
1. Bitcoin is not designed to replace fiat.
2. Bitcoin is about doing person to person transactions with no intermediary.
3. ..things like bitlicense are ... regulations when Bitcoin is interfaced with the legacy financial system.
\ and \ directly contradict each other, don't they?
1.) I have never heard anyone saying that bitcoin will replace fiat. Quite the contrary; It is a very worthy alternative, provided it remains independent of governments, and the industries that run them. There we can agree, not a replacement for fiat. In fact, it must be strongly protected from *becoming* just another fiat. Really no idea where you came up with that one.
2 &amp; 3.) As said before, there are already plenty legal channels for retribution against unscrupulous exchanges. We need to be VERY careful promoting even more government interference. It is unnecessary. The very best way forward for bitcoin would be free from any special laws concerning it. Welcoming even more special government regulations against cryptocurrencies is inviting disaster. 
Calling this real concern "cultist nonsense" sound silly, or like an industry shill. There are very powerful players that would love nothing other than to turn bitcoin into just another fiat. To ignore that threat is folly.
(This and other serious bitcoin forums have been under heavy attack lately by paid shills spewing disinformation and blatant abuse. We're all rather tired of that nonsense so, if you wish to be taken seriously, I strongly suggest you stick to your talking points and leave the hyperbole to the scam artists. We *do* know enough to tell the difference, so again, stop that.)

Lightning has nothing to do with bitcoin. It is not an improvement at all, they are just piggybacking their project on bitcoin's already established resources.
Shady move. There is nothing strange about finding it disrespectful to use another project's resources for your own benefit.
I will have to look into Lightning more, but from what I understand it's akin to "colored coins", something bitcoin definitely does NOT need.

This yahoo company might control a few bitcoin devs, but they are in no way the end-all-be-all.
Again, they have zero to do with bitcoin, they are a commercial venture. 
To distrust commercial interests in such a strong position to influence the project is only sane. This is another huge threat to bitcoin.
For instance, it is a well known threat that allowing too much centralization of mining power is incredibly dangerous. The benefits of cryptocurrencies to large commercial players, vs the general population of users, are very significantly different. They are not always compatible, and very often completely opposite.
I say again, this company contributes nothing. Certain developers do, but under what circumstances and with what motive? Better to have bitcoin slow, but honest than give in to greed.
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:48:48
People buying into fly-by-knight scams that hijack the resources of actually respectable projects might be ignorant...
Pointing out that such shady projects and teams are a problem, is anything but.
Can you send me bitcoins with a lightningcoin client that I can recieve and send with a bona fide bitcoin client?
If not, then it is is an incompatible altcoin, not bitcoin, and is in need of its own blockchiain.

If they really wanted to contribute something, they could submit it to the bitcoin project. They don't, because they are running a get rich quick scam using bitcoin's good name.
If they acted as the altcoins they actually are, that would also be respectable. 
As you say, just because they *say* they are part of bitcoin, doesn't mean it's true.

Exactly the opposite. People that have been around for a while know full well the level of spam and disinformation that scam artists constantly spew here, and other serious bitcoin forums.
Max block size is already too big. Increasing it is in no way a "better way". People that actually know about and care about bitcoin know this.

Absolutely. The huge risk of centralization of mining power must be avoided. There is zero good reason for bitcoin to willy-nilly increase block size. There are MUCH better solutions coming down the pipe.
In fact, max block size is too big right now. A *decrease* would be beneficial to bitcoin in general,

You are so much much talking about yourself here.  Talk about an agenda!  Half the crap you say has zero meaning, just silly shaming attempts and straw-man arguments.
Where you're at least *trying* to make a sensical point or 2 is interesting, it's just buried in this huge diatribe of tinfoil hat theories and abuse. Not easy to pick out anything worth commenting on, but we'll try again...
Again, that serious bitcoin forums are plagued by paid shills is no secret, and very far from theory. Trying to deny it is simply ridiculous, especially here on reddit. 
We do agree that even more specific cryptocurrency regulation is to be fought, and it's good the trademark app for bitcoin was axed.
You know, it sounds like we agree on more than we don't, at least the 2 or 3 serious things you've said through all this. That we do tend to agree on your serious points just makes all your crazy talk even more confusing.

@_date: 2016-08-10 05:25:31
oh ok, I get it.  
Regulation of a service is not the topic at hand. It is governmental regulation of bitcoin in general. Nobody could know what YOU were talking about because 99% of your posts in this thread are nothing more than silly shaming attempts.
Now it's clear you are desperately trying to convince this forum that regulation of bitcoin, allowing governmental control, is somehow beneficial.
Coinbase and such, as GOX before them, will suffer sudden and permanent excommunication from the cryptocurrency community when they fuck up.  We *already* enter a a legally binding contract with them. Nothing more is needed. 
**There are already *plenty* of channels for legal retribution against such exchanges. We need no more government control / regulation over bitcoin itself whatsoever.** 
They would only be another tool for powerful agents that would so love to co-opt, or destroy cryptocurrency. This is a very large danger that is very well understood here.
@_date: 2016-08-31 22:02:56
You cannot use bitcoins on a bona fide bitcion wallet that are sent with a Lightningcoin client. They are incomparable cryptocurrencies. That is the very definition of altcoin.

Can you transfer Lightningcoin to a bona fide bitcoin wallet, and transfer it away as bonafide bitcion?
No, you can't. The two are incompatible. Lightning is an altcoin, as are all these so-called "layer 2" scams.
They are by all rights, altcoins, just with zero integrity. 
If they had anything worthy to offer they would call themselves altcoins. Competition is a good thing.
Straight up mooching off the name of an already established project, brigading respectable bitcoin forums with their abusive trolling... and as we see above, straight up shit-slinging when they're called out for it.
If lightningcoin advertised itself as what it actually is, an altcoin... if they had done something positive for cryptocurrency from the beginning, instead of the crap fest they're driving now,
hell, if it worked better than bitcion, I'd use it too.

"open" does not mean that any project can just come alone and try to steal the good faith, reputation and name of the parent project. Well, can, but they show a complete lack of integrity and honesty doing it.
A fork, modified, ok. That is an altcoin. That is respectable. Own blockchain see, then they would be doing something good. Competition is to be encouraged
As it stands, trying to affiliate themselves with the mother project when they have nothing to do with it... 
Only bad for bitcoin, very dirty business, and completely untrustworthy.

"everyone here" ??  No, there are only a very few that think that some completely unaffiliated project is somehow, magically, part of bitcion, or has any right to claim such.
It is also very well known that tons of money is dumped into shilling here. Advertising paid for by these scam artist to spread this ridiculous idea that they are bona fide bitcion anything.
The vast majority of people on this forum know what's up with these unscrupulous outfits.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:43:39


Not for bitcoin, in the least.
They need their OWN blockchain for that kind of project, which I guess is true (?), but for some reason they are still calling it bitcoin? Shady shit.
I don't see any benefit from any project doing this except themselves. To piggyback on bitcoin's already well established name and resources is to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
I like the Mega project, and I wish that crazy fucker Kim all the best. Know people that have worked with him.
Still, he has no right (though plenty of reason) to call his micro transactions "bitcoin". None that I can see.
Again, this is NOT a good thing for bitcoin, its users, or supporters.

There is no "block size debate", just a bunch of propaganda from get-rich-quick scam artists.
There was never a chance in hell of turning bitcoin development over to any of the projects screaming for an instant increase in max block size.
Any scale-out concerns already are being addressed in a sane and safe way, with none of the risks of further centralization of mining power that the spammers would so love.

He is leader of exactly nothing.  This shit has been paraded out as "proof" so much, and been pointed out that this Back character is nobody, it's not even funny.
There never was any question of "consensus" or "majority" or any of your buzzwords. The question is irrelevant, because there is no chance of it happening, no matter how much scam artists pay people to hype up this type of spam.
There is zero good reason to up max block size presently. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:39:30
Not really.  I find absolutely zero need for it. 
I highly doubt the vast majority of bitcoin users will ever even know about it, let alone find it useful.
If they had anything like a good idea, why didn't they make a push request to integrate it into bitcoin instead of trying to piggyback on bitcoin's success?

Can you use Lighningcoin with a bona fide bitcoin wallet?
No, you cannot.  Lightning has zero to do with bitcion.
If they are using the bitcoin blockchain to transfer their own incompatible coins, they are nothing but leeches.
Altcoins need their own blockchain. Anything less is robbery.
No, tcp/ip is not anywhere near comparable. Do you people all read the same script or what?

So, they are for bitcoin transactions, specifically.




Yes, this is clear. We are talking about new regulation *specific* to cryptocurrency.  Class, this is a Bad Idea.
Put your hands up and step AWAY from government regulation. 
There is zero benefit for extra laws mandating the transaction of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and other currencies.  There are plenty of laws governing business contracts. I still assert that any larger control is not needed for cryptocurrencies. Allowing the government to treat it as fiat is a bad, bad idea, for a lot of  very important reasons.
Anonymity, secrecy, security... things no bank has any motive to really offer. 
Waltzing into the cesspool of corruption that is our modern, globalized, and *completely* corrupt fiat system with our eyes closed = the destruction of everything good about bitcoin.
Don't take that first step. We need to stop the crap like this that has leaked into bitcoin as it is.
If the only way we can exchange crypto for cash (of whatever country) is with *full government consent*, then let's just not. 
You insist on making this all so very, very personal, so here's my critique on your conversation style;
The rest of your post is just more empty social commentary that is neither interesting, nor welcome. 
Not to mention directly contradicting yourself, again and again.
You've been warned against both.
That there are shills on social media is no secret. It's very obvious when a bunch of advertising money is dumped. Messages  with 1% signal, 99% noise, not unlike the ones you write, are abundant. 
Nobody with any actual knowledge takes them seriously. Sadly, they do catch a few newbies. Sway them for a bit until they learn the truth. I fell for such  emotional diatribes for a day or 2 when I found  out about cryptocurrencies too. 
I'm just cherrypicking your actual, *somewhat* realistic points, and easily filling them with holes, as has been done again, and again here. It's all been tried before you see...  and  if anyone actually serious about cryptocurrencies, what benefits they bring, they only have to do some basic research to see the difference.
As I said, we're all really tired of the push to gain control. Don't be another victim! The people paying for such propaganda are a very, very bad investment. Better your spend your time really looking into technology rather than this broken record that our governments, or somehow our current banking system, is an answer.
 
Zero hate here. I don't blame the masses for working for such scam artists. I've been poor and did call center sales. 
I do abhor the damage it does to a promising tech like cryptocurrency though. The people behind it are infinitely more dangerous than any telephone sales sweatshop owner. 
 
Protip: If you wanna set a trap for the misinformed, there won't be any of them reading this far down, so stop the drama. You're wasting our time, and it seems like, someone's money.  You really need to START with your huge emotional outbursts. ;)

Good points, and my point stands even stronger.
These "layer 2" scam artists have zero to do with bitcoin, either the protocol, or the bitcoins themselves. 
They are altcoins, pure and simple. Trying to piggyback on the bitcoin name displays a profound lack of integrity. 
If they were halfway respectable in their dealings, offered real competition with their altcoins, I'd take a look.

@_date: 2016-08-04 07:23:09

And what about security risks? Difficult enough to keep bitcoin anonymous, what is this extra level of complexity they want to piggyback on bitcoin mean for privacy?

"centralization" in the context of cryptocurrency has to do with mining power, not implementations.
We don't need even more dodgy altcoin schemes trying to piggyback on bitcoin's infrastructure. 
Start a bona fide altcoin. Actual competition is good. To do that, you need your own blockchain (and forums for that matter).

No, the bitcoin blockchain is for bitcoin. Some project trying to hijack another's resources is a detestable practice. Not to be taken seriously or trusted.
There is absolutely no reason for bitcoin wallets to use lightningcoin. If lingtning project has anything worthy going for it, they can either 1.) offer to integrate it into bitcoin with a push request. 2.) get their own blockchain and offer actual competition.
What they are doing *is* piggybacking their incompatible product on top of another project's resources. This is shady as hell.
wait, it is denominated and settles in bitcoin...  so, I can use a bona fide bitcoin wallet and you can use lightning to send me bitcoins?  I think I asked this before. It is a *very* important question.

Larger block size puts smaller miners at a distinct disadvantage, and big money players at an advantage. This encourages the risk of one group or entity gaining a controlling percentage of mining power.
With that they can do all kinds of stuff to cheat, or downright ruin the blockchain network.  This is a very serious threat, and bitcoin does have some very serious enemies. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 06:44:15
The whole classic coin debacle, and many others like it, was nothing more than a hostile takeover attempt. They not only wanted an altcoin, they wanted to kill the parent project (bitcoin). Completely hijacking bitcoin's already established infrastructure. 
Thankfully, it didn't have a chance in hell of succeeding, no matter how much propaganda / disinformation money they poured into trying to sway public opinion. Nobody in their right mind is willing to turn bitcoin over to a tiny handful of devs, especially ones so lacking in respect or integrity.

So it takes B and C off the blockchain, for people to add all kinds of whatever they want to it.  This is the problem I see. My concern is that there are many organizations that would love to turn bitcoin into something controllable, profitable, like fiat is. 
Being able to track transfers could well lead to laws outlawing anything else. This is a very realistic threat.
I am against anything that allows such tracking functionality (more than we have) to bitcoin. "colored coins" for example. Horrible idea.

I disagree with such simplistic black &amp; white sentiments.
I definitely see a negative in any technology piggybacking on bitcoin that makes tracking transactions easier / verifiable. This MAST project, like so many other projects we've seen lately, would allow that.
Bitcoin has many enemies. Large financial organizations would love to twist it into something profitable and controllable like fiat. They also have powerful lobbies to push such into law, if the technology is available to do that.
This is why I disapprove of anything in that direction. Even that part of Segregated Witness itself is undesirable. I see it playing into the status quo. 
In my eyes, this is a real threat to bitcoin. If it fails, it will be through laws that make untraceable transactions illegal. This must be avoided.

At this point, there's no need to even try to explain it away with stupidity. It's just outright greed, and a disgusting disrespect for the very thing they make the most money off of; Bitcoin enthusiasts and businesses.
@_date: 2016-04-03 06:04:01
In the end it's a mute point, because this MAST *is* a side project wanting to piggyback on bitcoin, which is only a fantasy. We've seen plenty of these lately. An interesting thought project.
I don't think you're thinking things through if you say this improves privacy. With the parts it unloads from the blockchain, people can add whatever they want, including stuff that does verification.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:29:38
No, it may only rest after retribution for its despicable actions.
On its way out for sure, but hopefully not like GoX, that got away with millions. 
There is nothing left of Coinbase that is anything of worth. They have zero integrity. Their actions show this very clearly.
Sighing onto Jihan's 2x scam,  supporting Ver's hostile takeover attempt.  
Coinbase is  fully anti-crypto, and absolutely anti-Bitcoin.
Only their own profits are motivating their shady actions.
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:05:43
Not to forget, Ver has hardly any dev team to speak of working on his BCH scam.
The ones he *can* get to work for him have proven themselves completely incompetent again, and again.  They couldn't even figure out how to increase block size!
An actual Bitcoin dev pointed out the mistake, so that they wouldn't spam dangerous garbage on the blockchain.
They're still spamming garbage (BCH), but it could have been even worse.  The entire thing is nothing but a get-rich-quick scheme with zero credibility or usefulness as an actual cryptocurrency.

You cannot compare something like ETH with Bitcoin.  They use different technologies.  
BTC has proven the far superior.   Has much wider adoption, and a much larger Dev team.
By all means though, go ahead.  But SegWit is just starting, and the future looks bright ahead.  
@_date: 2016-04-19 07:54:24
Tying your bitcoins to something so uniquely identifiable with you yourself is a horrible idea.
This would completely negate the anonymous and secure nature of cryptocurrency, one of its major advantages.
@_date: 2016-04-19 08:04:36
No idea how you came to that conclusion. They have *acted* exactly like they want complete control of bitcoin. Actions speak louder than propaganda.
Any advantage that classic coin offered, bitcoin is already working on.  Bitcoin has every advantage, without the enormous (and really unrealistic) risk of turning the project over to a tiny handful of dissenting devs.
There is absolutely nothing "regular" about how the classic coin team went about it. Hostility, shilling, downright shit-slinging, spamming. Not just here, but on many bitcoin forums.
There is a large and knowledgeable bitcoin dev team. They're on it. What is painful is to consider how many were fooled by such devious practices such as classic (and again, many other get-rich-quick scam artists).
The shady part is them not offering true competition. Altcoins are good. If Classic Coin was truely better, hell, I'd have used it. The shady part is also the manipulation tactics, lies and blatant disinformation they spread, trying to make their project seem like a "thing". 
Even if they turned around and showd some integrity now, made an altcoin with *its own blockchain* (and forums, for that matter), they have completely lost all trust in cryptocurrency community.
Again, there are many projects trying to hijack bitcoin's well deserved name and infrastructure. I frown upon any such shady tactics from any project that uses them.
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:20:06
There's a damn good reason governments don't want Crypto to exist.  The best things about it is that it takes power out of their hands.
For buying coffee, we have fiat, ATM cards, Visa and paypal. Centralized points of failure but quick n cheap for trivial things.
For keeping money safe from banks and political gangsters, making international payments with little interference, protecting a person's hard earned savings, we have Crypto. These are virtually priceless advantages.
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:57:15
No, there is zero "robustness" about it.  There IS a huge ton of propaganda that Ver &amp; Co pays for.  We see it every time he pushes another of his scams.
All you have to do is look up the dev team behind BCH... there hardly is one.  And those that there are, are completely under Ver's control.
It cannot in any way be called a legit Crypto. 
Some might use and abuse it for a quick buck, but that is all it is good for.   It has no future.   
I didn't bother dumping the scamcoin.  NOt going to trust my BTC to some exchange...  hardly any even offered it.  Now of the ones that did, the largest just took a huge dump and shut down for a day or so.
Is coinbase back up now?  Not that I care.  They are completely untrustworthy. Signed Jihan's 2x scam, and said they would support Ver's takeover attempt (bch) if it was successful (and any other they could profit from, obviously).
No, none of these gangsters have any "robustness", not even for those in on their scam.  They are well known for stabbing each other in the back.  Look at the so-called Hong-Kong "agreement"... an agreement among gangsters, that the main instigators dind't hold up for even a few months!
Same with the NY "agreement" (aka the 2x scam) ... a bunch of disreputable outsiders agreeing with themselves to run a hostile takeover attempt on Bticoin.
None of them robust whatsoever.  Adoption of BCH is laughable, and you need to take your propaganda back to /bct where it belongs.
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:50:01
BCH is useless as a currency.  
Ver has no dev team to speak of, and controls the entire thing.  It cannot even be called a legit altcoin.
A get-rich-quick scam is what it is.  Please don't advise people to use it. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:53:21
The things Bitcoin really shine at are just as good as ever.
For tiny transactions there are credit cards &amp; cash that don't have those advantages. They aren't needed in that case.
The real wonder of Crypto &amp; Bitcoin is getting around the disadvantages that centrally controlled Fiat / Banking systems bring with them.
@_date: 2016-04-02 04:40:49
There are other currencies for such things. It's like trying to piggyback traceable bank transfers on top of bitcoin.

Oh, it's been very clear that Ver employs astroturfers and shills to push his scam coins for a long, long time.
Caught pretty much red handed with his Unlimited scam.  
I don't have the link with me, drat, but there is plenty of evidence if you are interested in digging through the older posts. About a year ago I think?  
The man is absolutely despicable, and his cohort Jihan is no better.  Shady gangsters to the core.
He uses /btc as one of his launching grounds for disinformation and propaganda campaigns.  Blatantly promotes his scam site bitcoin.COM there, absolutely a conflict of interest.  
The sub is basically owned and operated by scam artists.  
Not to mention, when you see Ver start pushing another scam coin, and simultaneously, so many crypto forums all over the web are hit with a slew off anti-bitcoin propaganda, "Big Blocks NOW!" disinformation,  and when pointed out that they are factually wrong, dive right into shit-slinging and derailing...  Yah, you know that they are paid.  The typical MO of such propaganda outfits.
We've seen it so much before, with XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x BCH...  every damn time.  
Fortunately the scams, and the shilling that go with it, are getting easier and easier to spot.
@_date: 2016-04-20 18:41:07

@_date: 2018-01-07 23:54:23
no, willy-nilly increasing block size will give exactly those shady bad actors even more mining centralization.
They've already been caught gumming up the mempool by spamming garbage blocks, then they push more of their "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda.
Their schemes have been denied again, and again, for damn good reason.
Bitcoin is still gaining value, is no way anywhere near the crash &amp; burn such gangsters say it is.  
What we need is to be patient and let the scaling tech unfold, now that Jihan, ver &amp; Co have been fored to stop blocking SegWit, things are moving forward.  Safely, sanely.
Things would be much better now if those yahoos hadn't been meddling, and now giving them what they want is the LAST thing we need.
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:37:58

And that is just fine.  Bitcoin is finally able to move forward with SegWit, and the scaling tech that opens the door for.
Handing more power over to the ones that were BLOCKING progress so long would be insanity.  That is exactly what willy-nilly increasing block size would do.  No thanks.

For all  your sugar coated words, you're still spewing "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda.   
Willy-nilly increasing block size would just put more power in the hands of the ones causing the problem.  Jihan, and his shady mining outfits spamming the blockchain with garbage to clog up the mempool,
then brigading legit crypto forums with their Big Blocks! disinformation.  
No, not gonna happen.  Bitcoin is doing just fine.  The roadmap is clear and is being implemented,  carefully, sanely, slowly. This is the only resonable way.
If you don't like the current state of things, go tell Jihan and his shady mining outfits to stop being assholes and leave Bitcoin alone.

no,  even if Ver &amp; Jihan managed the 51% attack they have tried to stage so often, it would still be totally unworthy.
BCH has zero value as an actual Cryptocurrency.  It is in no way even an altcoin.  It is a huge joke.
These yahoos that constantly pay for shills to push their "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda...
spam the blockchain with garbage to clog up the mempool...
they couldn't even figure out how to increase the block size!  LOLOLOLOL
Nobody in their right mind is investing in that BCH crap as a legit Cryptocurrency.
It is purely a pump-n-dump get-rich-quick scheme, like all the others from Ver, Jihan &amp; their cronies before it:
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, Bcash...   there will be more, but,
fortunately these scams are getting easier and easier to spot.  
No Open Source project can steal the resources from the parent project, try to proclaim itself the "one and only" and hold any semblance of legitimacy.  BCH has zero to do with Bitcoin, it is simply a hostile takeover attempt, like so many before it.
Please learn something about Open Source, Crypto and Bitcoin before you go spouting nonsense about "consensus" you got from /btc or some other cesspool of disinformation run by Ver.
Consensus means what direction the Bitcoin Open Source project will go.  
Jihan, Ver, and their gangster cronies are no part of it.  They are directly working against Bitcoin, its community, devs and reputable miners.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:17:22

the company that said it would support Ver's hostile takeover attempt BCH (or any other, obviously)?

This is false.  There might be side projects, spinnoffs, such a wallets and such, but the "main BCH dev team"  (ha ha) if you can call it that, is basically non-existant.
There will be no miraculous updates.  Their only idea is to infinitely increase block size, and completely centralize the mining power (and control) of it.
They basically want another paypal, completely under their control.
There is no way in hell this tiny team of incompetenets (they couldn't even figure out how to increase block size!) will come up with anything like the Lightning tech, not without SegWit.
And they cannot implement segwit wihout killing the ASICBOOST bullshit Jihan is running.  Nope, not gonna happen.


Your advice is good.  I do that myself.  Buying doesn't cost a lot in fees.  You're talking bullshit there.
If they bought $100 monthly over the last 6 months, any fees paid would be tiny compared to the gains made.
Unless you're one of the ones that pays $90 in fees for a $100 transfer and then goes on /btc to complain about how Bitcoin is broken,   or even worse, to legit crypto forums like here (were people don't accept such lies so easily).
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:34:10
BCH is in no way a legitimate altcoin.  It has zero value as a cryptocurrency. Hardly has a dev team to speak of, and is completely under the control of the gangster Ver.  
As for actual altcoins, there are many.  None have emerged as being as technologically robust as Bitcoin, nor have they gained acceptance in such a huge market as Bitcoin.
The scenario you're talking about could happen, one day, maybe, but never with the BCH scam.
Anyway, now that Jihan, Ver &amp; Co were forced to stop blocking Bitcoin progress, we have all the wonderful, safe and sane scaling tech to explore that SegWit allows.
The idea of willy-nilly increasing block size is insane, it would just put more power in the hands of those gangsters and Jihan's unscrupulous mining concerns. Ones that are already far to large.
No, we'll just let Bitcoin move along as it is. Slowly, steadily, and carefully.   
For all the doom and gloom propaganda, disinformation from Big Blocks NOW! shills, Bitcoin still is chugging right along.  :)
Onward and upwards.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:56:07
You can always go back to /btc and invest everything in the BCH scam... why don't you just toddle on off back there.

@_date: 2018-01-07 23:23:57
Oh hell no.  Exchanges make plenty enough money.  
The ones that offer what people want will be used. That is incentive enough.
Also, Coinbase signed onto Jihan's 2x scam, and blatantly said they would support Ver's BCH hostile takeover if it succeeded (and obviously any other that comes along they can profit from).
Colinbase is not to be trusted, at all.  They don't want to use SegWit for purely selfish reasons, simple as that.  
Other actually trustworthy exchanges, that actually support Bitcoin, have already implemented it.  They deserve our business.
coinbase does not.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:32:40

@_date: 2018-01-14 23:12:16
Hiccups.  the tech is in its infancy.  
Bitcoin has survived brutal attacks like this many, many times.
Survived them all, and now SegWit has been irreversibly activated.
The Bitcoin community had a lot to do with that, threatening a UASF.  forcing Jihan &amp; Co. to shape up or ship out.  
To the great delight of reputable mining outfits, bitcoin community, and I'm sure the Bitcoin dev team.
There will always be shady bad actors such as Jihan, with btc1, x2, or Ver with Classic, unlimited, BCash...
but Bitcoin, and Crypto in general, are still doing just fine.
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:57:25
This is in no way a good promotion for any Crypto.
Google = evil.  It's like Ver saying something remotely good about Bitcoin; 
if that ever happened, he would have shady ulterior motives. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:20:12


The backlog is majorly caused by shady mining concerns under Jihan's thumb.
Shady companies like Coinbase could alleviate this greatly by adopting SegWit, and eventually tech like lightning &amp; Co.  They obviously see bigger profits elsewhere.  They'll go the way of Gox &amp; Co before them.
Never forget, Coinbase signed Jihan's 2x scam, and said they would support Ver's BCH attack if it succeeded. :(
As cancerous as such compaines are, they are not the *source* of the problem mempool being so clogged. The mempool is not so full from simple use, it is most often an attack by the shady mining Jihan is responsible for.
We agree, large (actually TOO large) Crypto exchanges like Coinbase need to get with the program. The reputable, trustworthy ones are. Many have already implemented Segwit  Coinbase is not among them.  The OP story is an example of those that are the future of Crypto.
And we agree too.. Bitcoin is doing just fine.  It has lived through so many hostile takeover attempts at the hands of Jihan, Ver &amp; their cronies...  their attacks are getting easier and easier to spot too.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.

Trying to hijack the resources of a sibling / parent project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source.
You don't do that shit if you have any shred of integrity, which is why Ver's reputation is so shitty, and not just in Crypto.
Nobody wants to deal with such a shady outfit, which is why he can't get any decent devs to work for him. Pretty much career suicide.
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:44:56
Is this suppose to be irony?
If you're serious, then your answer to scaling is handing even more power (mining centralization) to shady outfits like Jihan's. The ones that have been caught again and again mining garbage blocks to fill up the mempool.
The same ones that push their Big Blocks NOW! propaganda and disinformation to no end.  
No, shady gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have been denied their schemes all along, and will continue to be.
The boogyman of some fantacy "market share loss" would be infinitely better than the total takeover of Bitcoin by unscrupulous bad actors.
Much better to play it safe, carefully implementing *sane* methods for expansion.  Safeguarding against even further mining power centralization is key to Bitcoin's longevity and usefulness.
Your idea of a "band-aid" (willy-nilly increasing block size) would only do much more harm than anything, an no amount of fear-mongering and disinformation will change that.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.

Coinbase is shady as hell.  They signed on Jihan's 2x scam, and said they would support Ver's hostile takeover attempt if BCH succeeded (and obviously any other for that matter).

The 2x scam has nothing to do with Bitcoin, except as yet another hostile takeover attempt on it.

@_date: 2018-01-20 01:27:08
Jihan and the shady mining concerns under his direction are also well known for spamming garbage blocks to clog the meme pool.
This usually comes in conjunction with Ver pushing some scam coin or other (hi BCH) and a huge brigade of propaganda and shilling that hits legit crypto forums (including this one).
The pattern is very clear to see for those that have been around even a few years. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:39:32

@_date: 2018-01-13 14:25:15
Anyone that knows the first thing about Crypto, and specifically Bitcoin, does know this.
That is why the Bitcoin communtiy, devs, and trustworthy minng concerns have denied gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co their "Big Blocks NOW!" scams again, and again.
There is a whole bunch of disinformation and propaganda pushed by said scam artists is all.  This, and other legit crypto forums all over the web are bombarded with shills and astroturfers pushing Ver's latest scam coin, or Jihan's latest takeover attempt.
They are the only ones ridiculous enough to promote willy-nilly increasing block size, especially now with SegWit activated.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:45:47
Unscrupulous mining outfits under Jihan's thumb do this on the regular.
Most often in coordination with Ver pushing another scam, such as BCH.  
It's an often seen trick they use, spamming the blockchain with garbage to clog the mempool, then bombarding crypto forums all over the web with their "big blocks NOW!" propaganda.

@_date: 2018-01-07 23:30:38
That's absolutely rediculous.  If you pay attention to crypto trends at all, you see people moving from altcoin to altcoin all the time.
First, people aren't moving away from BTC en-mass like the disinformation pushers want us to believe....
Senond, if they did, What Mr Hunt says is exactly what would happen.  Currently there is no other crypto that has shown itself to have the longevity and usefulness of Bitcoin, nor the worldwide adoption.

One attempts such exactly like Ver, Jihan &amp; Co have again and again.
Trying to steal the resources of an already established Open Source project, instead of producing their own.
Ver has zero claim to the name Bitcoin. Neither he nor his incompetent "devs" he has working for him have ever contributed one line of code to the Bitcoin project.
Ver just constantly tries to steal the name, offering one get-rich-quick scam after another.   BCash is just the latest in a long line of such scams: XT, Classic, Unlimited, and mixed up in Jihan's scams such as btc1, 2x...  none of which have anything to do with Bitcoin.  
Well, except they are hostile takeover attempts against it.   
Also, look up the very real threat of a 51% attack, which is why these gangsters have been denied their "Big Blocks NOW!" crap again and again, and will continue to be.
Ver, Jihan &amp; Co produce nothing worthy. None of their scams can be considered bona fide altcoins.  They only try to steal the hard work of others, and profit from it by fooling people that don't know better.

They've been denied their power grab again and again, for damn good reason.
Now that they were forced to stop blocking SegWit by a threatened UASF, we can move forward with *safe and sane* scaling options.

They signed Jihan's 2x scam, and blatantly said they'd support Ver's hostile takeover attempt (BCH) if it succeeded (or any other attack, obviously).
They have zero credibility.  
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:47:06
Yah, it is a tricky thing to take advantage of.
Those that got lucky and found someone actually willing to buy BCH, and had the know how, sold off immediately. 
Now it is pretty much impossible to sell the crap, on any kind of trustworthy marketplace anyway.
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:01:59


Beware of Coinbase!  They originally said they would support Ver's BCH scam if it was successful.  Coinbase are very scummy and only after profit. They have zero interest in Open Source or any kind of integrity whatsoever.
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:31:55
Because it's not any kind of logical argument.
In fact, it's an outright lie, like BCH itself.  It has no worth as an actual cryptocurrency.  It is not a legit altcoin, just a get-rich-quick scam, like so many of Ver's bogus attempts before it.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:33:16
More importantly, pointing out Roger Ver's scams, like OP is so usefully doing, would get your comment removed and you a ban.
Ver doesn't like any truth on his darling little /btc propaganda outlet.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:32:00
People aren't *opposed* to it,  well, except for Jihan &amp; his unscrupulous mining outfits.
Lightning just isn't quite ready for primetime yet. Testnet is the place to  experiment and bughunt for now.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:09:12


what are you talking about?  The official bitcoin wallet already has SegWit.  just not implemented in the GUI yet.
Other things were more important to do first.  The user interface is in an upcoming update.
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:56:25
Says the one pushing Ver's BCH scam.  Give us a break.
People here do know what's up.  Go ahead and push your get-rich-quick schemes, but if you try it in a legit crypto forum, you cannot expect to get a friendly response.
Better promote such scams in /bch.  They love the crap over there. The sub is pretty much run by Ver anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:30:07
According to Murphey's law, much more likely to be a buyer responsible.
I remember back when we just reached $200 and I bought some... Within hours, huge dip.  
I was pretty sure that was all my fault, but a redditor posted that he did the same just then...
So it was him for sure. ;)

How would they fool people into buying their scam BCH?
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:13:28
The anti-Bitcoin brigadiers come from /btc 
This and other legit crypto forums are constantly being attacked, as well as Bitcoin itself. 
Shady gangsters like Ver &amp; Co are well known for paying shills. :(
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:17:19
Forget it.  welcoming government "regulation" is the exact opposite of what crypto is about.
Tempting, for sure, because of bad actors like Roger Ver &amp; Co, but it brings with it much more problems than it fixes.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:22:07
False.  The ones supporting BTC aka actual, bona fide Bitcoin, are absolutely legit.
Roger Ver's scam BCH is in no way legit.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:49:09


Sadly, that is the entire focus of Ver's bullshit scamming projects.
They were getting sued because his bitcoin.COM scam site was so blatantly committing false advertising.
Why reminder posts like this are so great. (thanks OP!)
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:02:57
People wanted to dump the scamcoin BCH.
@_date: 2019-07-26 22:14:36
Legitimate competition is welcome and admired.
Trying to steal the name, image, and blockchain of a parent project is  completely corrupt, and any project doing so proves they have nothing real to offer. 
They spit in the face of everything Open Source stands for.
There is only one Bitcoin Open Source project.  The source is free to copy, but not the name, graphics or blockchian. 
You have a nice dream, but the things listed in OP's graphic are dead set against working with the crypto or open source  community. They work against it.
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:23:16
One of a long line of Roger Ver's attacks on Bitcoin.
It is based on the legitimate Bitcoin open source project, but is worthless as a cryptocurrency.  He has no dev team to speak of, and those that will work for him have proven themselves dangerously inept again and again.
BCH, like so many of Ver's scams, tries to steal the name, reputation, graphics, etc.. of the legit Bitcoin project. 
This is extremely bad, and discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source.
As an aside... you probably mean "bitcoin" Cash... there is actually  a separate project called "bcash" that (far as I know) has nothing to do with Ver's scams.
The thing to look for is BCH = Ver's scam.  
BTC = legitimate Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-04 12:47:05


Yes, it does.  Just not through the GUI yet, which should be included in an update or two.  There are other ducks to line up first.
You can implement SegWit on the command line right now though.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:58:12
The whole goal of Ver's propaganda outlets like /btc is to be confusing.
Anyone pointing that out is not welcome there.
Ver's bch isn't even a shitcoin... not a fork, not a bona fide cryptocurrency at all. 
It is just another in a long line of Ver's get-rich quick schemes.
He has hardly any dev team. The ones that WILL work for him have proven themselves inept to the point of being dangerous, again and again.
They couldn't even figure out how to increase max block size! (the key to Ver &amp; Jihan's scheme for a 51% attack)
A noble Bitcoin dev showed them their mistake, to avoid even greater damage.  
BCH, like all of Ver's scams, is a complete disaster, and nobody in their right mind would invest, unless they were in on the scam themselves, or duped by the disinformation.
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:21:18


This is absolute, total bullshit.  Mods here are tollerant to a  fault with all the blatant hate and propaganda Ver &amp; Co constantly spew.
This thread is no different.  Pure spam. 
None of those pretending to be Bitcoin have any respect for open source, Crypto, or any of the noobs they take in with their get-rich-quick scams.
There is only one Bitcoin open source project.  The code is open, the resources of the project (name, reputation, images, branding) ARE NOT.
If  you want to make an altcoin, it needs its own name, and blockchain.  Anything else spits in the face of Open Source  generally, and Cryptocurrency specifically.
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:09:05
No,  bitcoin core IS the official Bitcoin open source project.
BCH is just another of Ver's long line of scams that tried to steal the name and resources (images, name, reputation) from the legit bitcoin "core" project.
A legitimate altcoin is very welcome to fork from Bitcoin.  More (legit) competition is a Good Thing.  That is  not what BCH is.
Ver has no interst in such. Nor does he have the technical knowhow to produce a real altcoin.  All he does is try to steal the identity of an already established Open Source project (legit Bitcion BTC).
This type of despicable behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just cryptocurrency.
Why threads like this are important reminders / PSAs for newbies, so they don't get caught in his scam BCH (or whatever comes next).
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:00:15

This is what Ver &amp; Co are doing with their scam BCH, nothing else.
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:25:36
Calling it Bcash or BCH makes no difference, it's the same scam.  
No worth as an actual crypto, no dev team to speak of. Directly attempting to hijack the name and reputation of another Open Source project.  Shady as all get-out.  
BCH is just another in a long line of get-rich-quick schemes from the gangster Ver.
Who cares what people call it?  A pile of shit, by any other name, still stinks as bad.
Nobody in their right mind will trust his scam with anything of worth. 
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:17:54


Completely and totally false. There is one, and only one official Bitcoin Open Source project.
BCH (bitcoin cash) and other such scams have simply tried to steal the name and other resources (symbols &amp; such) from the parent project.
This despiclable behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all the Open Source word, not just bitcoin.
Roger Ver is behind so many of these get-rich-quick schemes / attacks.  Unlimited, Cash, mixed up in Jihan's crappy 2x deal, etc...
none of them are actual bitcoin. Not even legitimate altcoins. An altcoin can be based off of Bitcoin, but to be legit it needs its own name and branding. That is how Open Source works.
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:21:18
Better yet, don't deal with them at all.
Coinbase signed onto Jihan's 2x scam,
and explicitly said they would support hostile takeover attempts such as Ver's BCH if successful.
Coinbase is anti-Bitcoin and not to be trusted.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:59:23
That is like saying if you just sit down with the people that kidnapped your children, maybe we can all come to an understanding.
No.  BCH is a scam, nothing more, as anyone who does a bit of research quickly learns.
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:33:02
rediculous.  There are tons of people in this sub that are active in many other legitimate bitcoin forums.
The people that are clueless (or paid by Ver) are over at /btc.

Absolutely on the money here Mr Cannibalism.

Complete and total bullshit.  Crawl back to /btc where you came from.  You and your brigaders.  
From the votes here, they're at it again. Those yahoos constantly try to spread their propaganda here.
The Mods here are tolerant almost to a fault.  Nobody is banned here unless they constantly and consistently step WAY over the linke spreading BCH bullshit.
/bch on the other hand does not tolerate anyone speaking out the truth about Ver and his long line of scams attacking Bitcoin.

BCash doesn't even have a good base layer.
The tiny dev team it has working for it is completely under Ver's control. 
There is zero chance of them coming up with anything close to lightning. They couldn't even figure out how to increase block size! 
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:05:25

There is only one bona fide Bitcoin Open Source project.

LOL.. the very concept of Bitcoin is to sidestep such authoritarian bullshit. 
This sub is an enormous power for good.  Spreads information, fun and provides real info on scams like Ver's BCH &amp; Co. to protect newbies.
This sub, among other legit crypto forums all over the web, are bombarded with propaganda by scam artists... 
as documented by all the get-rich-quick schemes in the OP image.
There is only one Bitcoin Open Source Project. Always was, always will be.  Trying to steal the identity of a parent project is discouraged with extreme prejudice, in all of open source.

@_date: 2019-07-26 22:04:48


no, that would be scam artists like Ver &amp; Co, that push for bigger blocks to solidify their centralization of mining power. (hi Jihan!)
The Bitcoin project has made ENORMOUS bounds where scaling is concerned.  Segwit (which the scam artists fought against tooth and nail) ushered in a whole row of new solutions.
Lightning and many others. Massively decreasing the load on the official blockchain.  Not every cup of coffee needs to be in the permanent ledger.
And for really important stuff, that is also an easy option. 
None of the scams in the OP image are legitimate "forks".  Nor are  they even legit altcoins.  
Trying to steal the name and other resources of a parent project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source.
Such scams spit in the face of Open Source, and anyone running them has nothing but a get-rich-quick scheme
 (Hi Ver, Hi BCH, Hi /btc).
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:35:24
This is THE main bitcoin sub on reddit. There is no denying it.
The scams listed in the OP image have spit in the face of everyting Open Source stands for.  
Cesspools of disinformation and propaganda like /btc are plentiful.
Thankfully, we've seen plenty of such attacks on the bona fide Bitcoin open source project.  
People do know what is up.
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:56:45
Fees only went up  real high when Ver, Jihan &amp; Co were running active attacks.
Much like this whole thread, just so much blatant anti-Bitcoin propaganda it ain't even funny.
Have a feeling Ver's about to launch another "bitcoin" X scam.  His BCH is only the latest in a LONG line of such, 
and we see such propaganda pushed every time.
@_date: 2019-07-26 22:10:32
They are not legitimate forks.  They are scams, pure and simple.
Good luck  finding an exchange that deals in them. If you do, get in and out quick, because such shady outfits have no business doing business.  (hi Coinbase, hi BCH)
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:35:32
He missed the boat on cashing in the BCH scam coin.
It is now pretty much worthless. At the beginning of the attack (that BCH falsely labelled a "fork") it was worth doing such.
Now, people are just not botehred to sell it off for the pennies it is worth.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:11:37
Oh stop.  There hundreds and hundreds of devs working on the open source Bitcoin project. 
And when speaking about crypto, "decentralized" means specifically mining power and node distribution. It has nothing to do with software development, whatsoever.
You'll hear people trying to confuse the two all the time when shilling for another of Ver or Jihan's scams.  Please don't repeat their disinformation.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:37:30
EVERY SINGLE attack Ver launches on Bitcoin (and BCH is only the latest of MANY) 
has been nothing but a pump n dump get-rich-quick scheme.
Classic, Ultimate, mixed up in Jihan's x2 scheme, now BCH aka "bitcoin" cash.
So many have tried to steal the name Bitcoin, and none have hand anything to do with it.
(Except to the extent that they tried to steal a parent project's (legit Bitcoin's) identity.)
Also, When Ver "split" BCH (aka, launched the attack), Anyone holding legit Bitcoin (btc) also got equal coinage in the scam (bch).  THEN it was lucrative to (very carefully!) cash in on the scam bch doppelganger and get out.
It in no way diluted BTC's value.  (Well, except how every one of Ver's scams does, confusing newbies.)

This is disnohnest, or lacking in information.
/btc has been under Roger Ver's control LONG before his latest BCH scam, true.
It has been used to promote a whole line of such attacks on Bitcoin though.  Classic, Ultimate, now "bitcoin" Cash...
He was also mixed up in his buddy Jihan's bogus x2 scam.
/btc is a cesspool of propaganda and disinformation. Pure and simple.
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:20:56
Ver pretty much owns and operates /btc, one of many of his propaganda outlets all over the web.
Also, he is well known for hiring paid shills and brigading legit crypto forums all over the web.
We see constant attacks here (and many other forums as mentioned)  whenever he launches his newest round of attacks.
BCH is only the latest in a LONG line of them. :(
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:25:05


This is not true at all.  The mods here are tollerant to a fault with allowing Ver's BCH spam. 
You have to step WAY over the line to get a comment deleted, and oh crap, if they have to ban you for spamming BCH scam bullshit, you well deserved it!
/btc is owned and operated by Ver, who runs the BCH scam. They  are, indeed, extremely hostile to legit Bitcoin. As is only logical, as the whole scam is a direct attack on the Bitcoin open source project.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:19:27

Jihan, Ver &amp; CO's attacks on Bitcoin are the problem here, nothing else.  Don't start with more of their Big Blocks NOW propaganda.  They have been denied that power grab again and again,for damn good reason.

@_date: 2019-07-26 21:38:31
Exchanges that deal in blatant scams, like the majority on the list in the OP image, are not to be trusted.
(hi Coinbase) 
Trying to steal the name, image, blockchain of a parent project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source.
There might not be a law against it, nor should there be, 
but it means nobody can trust that project, or the people running the scam (hi Ver, hi BCH).
Any company that is so abusive they'll deal with such shit has no place on the market, at all.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:16:54
We'd never get any real scaling tech, because then Jihan, Ver and other shady gangsters that have blocked progress so long, and launched so many hostile takeover attempts, would have full control.
What they want is a centrally controlled payment system, much like Visa, or a central bank.  Willy-nilly increasing block size would only give them more mining power centralization.
That way lies madness.  IF it is absolutely necessary, the huge and international Bitcoin dev team will do it. Safely, and sanely.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:50:25
Oh, they know EXACTLY what they are doing.  Ver and his cohorts anyway.  
Anyone crypto newbie that does serious research for themselves quickly learns the truth and abandons Ver's /btc scam sub.

Exchanges NOT filtering out scams IS a dangerous situation.
Anything selling any of Ver's scams, or any in the list of pretenders in OP's image have no integrity whatsoever.
Legitimate altcoins are fully welcome! Bona fide competition is a Good Thing. 
Trying to steal the name of another project means the thieves have nothing real to offer themselves.
If an Exchange is so corrupt, or blind they don't pay attention or care, then they deserve to be discarded like the trash they're pushing.

Not dealing in scams does not equal being "judicious".
Waht a load of crap.
Exchanges need to have integrity. This is not a hard concept to grasp. 
What is inherently anti-crypto, and anti-open source is trying to steal the name and other resources of a parent project.
The SOURCE is open to copy, nothing else.  Crap like the list in the OP image are scams, pure and simple.
Exchanges that deal in them are promoting scams. Pure and simple. (hi coinbase, hi BCH)
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:46:40
Ver has already thought it all out.  Him trying to steal the name of another Open Source project is fully by design. It isn't the first time he's pulled such shady shit either.
/btc is used by him, as well as his scam site bitcoin.COM to promote his scams. 
There absolutely is a *real* bitcoin. The original open source bitcoin project. The name and all other resources belong to it.
The source code is free to copy and use for your *own* project, including own name and blockchain. Such legitimate competeition is fully encouraged and welcome.
Ver, Jihan, and their gangster cronies are neither interested in honest competition, nor are they capable of it.
Hence the long line of hostile takeover attempts. This behavior is to be discouraged with extreme prejudice. It only proves they and their get-rich-quick schemes have no legitimacy.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:45:24
No, they are seperate entities.  BCH, Ver's scam, has nothing to do with bona fide Bitcoin except attacking it, as Ver has done many times.
There was no "dilution" at all.  Bitcoin (BTC) is still it's own market, as is Ver's BCH scam.
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:52:28
Bitcoin has only one standard.  That laid out, in black and white in the Dev thread of the Bitcoin open source project.

Because this, and other legit crypto forums all over the web, have been constantly bombarded with nonsense propaganda and disinformation pushing "Big Blocks NOW!" 
It is no coincidence that such brigades coincide with every new scam that Ver, Jihan &amp; Co. launch. 
Now that those yahoos have been forced to stop blocking SegWit, safe and sane scaling can move forward.  There is no reason to even consider increasing block size until we've explored other avenues we have available now.
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:15:58

@_date: 2017-12-20 00:51:43
Ver's whole reason for trying to hijack the Bitcoin name and reputation is to confuse his scam coin with the legitimate bona fide Bitcoin.

Oh, those conversations sitll go on.
There is just a whole bunch more FUD, propaganda and disinformation from shady bad actors such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, pushing their scams with "Big Blocks NOW!" nonsense.
This and other legit crypto forums are brigaded by such shilling &amp; astroturfing promoting scams such as BCH, 2x, btc1, classic, unlimited, etc.

@_date: 2017-12-22 12:55:34
Transactions need to be validated. 
Also, when a new block is found, the next one in line wins. Those with more bandwidth have a big advantage there.
This is why gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are constantly pushing their Big Blocks NOW! propaganda.  It would give them an even bigger advantage, pushing smaller mining outfits even further off the map.

@_date: 2017-12-20 00:54:23
It is not idiotic to stand up for legitimacy and honesty in Open Source projects.  
Trying to hijack the resources of another project is bad. There is zero reason to stick up for Ver and his hijacking and disinformation attempts.
He has no legitimate claim to the name, or any other resources of any other project. There's nothing directly illegal about what he's doing, but it still absolutely proves that he's a scam artist and nothing else.
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:54:53
None of the yahoos trying to steal Bitcoin's name have an iota of the know-how, tallent, international HUGE dev team...
If they had anything worthy to offer, they'd make a real altcoin,
instead of running a scam on an already existing project.
The mere attempt to do such = total crap that should be shunned with extreme prejudice.

To hear the promoters of scam coins talk about the white paper, it sounds exactly like that.  
There have been a long line of them from gangsters such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.  and every time they try to push one of their hostile takeover attempts, legit crypto forums are bombarded with propaganda and disinformation promoting them.
Lots and lots of nonsense about the white paper, and Satoshi's original vision... blah blah blah.  Zero logical merit behind them.

That would just further encourage even more mining power centralization, which is why scam artists such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are constantly pushing for it.
There is no reason to talk about block size until all the exciting scaling tech that SegWit opens the door for has been explored.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:56:14
They hardly even tried to hide their motives, which are completely shady.   BCH, 2x, btc1, Classic, Unlimited...  all scams and hostile takeover attempts.
They won't be the last, but thankfully, they are getting easier to spot.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:08:35
willy-nilly increasing block size would give shady mining outfits like Jihan's even more mining power centralization.  This is why he and Ver, and other scam artists, are constantly pushing their "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda.
Handing these bad actors even more power would be insane.  Not gonna happen.
Now SegWit is activated, and we can move forwards.  No need for talk of block size, we're using block weight now.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:05:57
The mempool was so stopped up, mostly due to Jihan and his band of untrustworthy miners.  They do like to spam garbage blocks,  and it's no coincidence they've historically  ramped up such activity when Ver is pushing one of his scamcoins or the other.
So it kinda does have to do with some (unscrupulous) miners, but not the way OP thinks.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:20:58
Yes, and the scam artist Roger Ver should also stop using bitcoin.COM to sell his scam BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:36:27
If you can't have a good honest discussion anymore, don't blame the community..
The fault for that lies squarely on the shoulders of scam artists like Ver, Jihan &amp; Co. They are the ones that blocked progress so long. They are the ones spamming the blockchain with garbage blocks to clog it.
And now we are seeing, yet again, another wave of brigading with their ridiculous "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda. 
Go over to /btc, that Ver basically owns and operates, and tell him and his shills to knock it off. 
We're trying to have acutal, intelligent discussions here, and other legit crypto forums all over the web, but it's difficult when being hit with wave after wave of Ver's astroturfers. 
SegWit is no longer being blocked, and work is moving forward on safe and sane scaling tech it opens the door for. Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:40:11
There's absolutely no reason to call it "bitcoin cash".  
There's also absolutely no reason for the use of "core".
Stealing the resources of another project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
Along with all the other shady stuff going on with Ver's latest scam, trying to hijack the name right away tells you what a shady outfit he runs.
On top of that, all the technological problems. That's another topic though.
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:24:38
Encouraging people to investigate for themselves is IN NO WAY condoning or encouraging violence.
Trying to hold Jones responsible for that nut job is absolutely absurd.
This is the type of lame excuse that abusive, monopolistic companies try to hide their political censorship behind.
They are the liers, spin artists and propagandists. Allowing *actual* calls to violence and *real* hate speech from left-leaning people and organizations on their platforms, while pulling bullshit, like you're repeating here, on people with right-leaning views.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:49:22
Giving into that 2x scam is zero compromise. 
That's like saying it's wise to "compromise" with kidnappers.
The constant push for "Big Blocks NOW!" is a power grab, nothing more.  It would only increase mining power centralization, decrease node distribution. 
Exactly why Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. have been denied their schemes again, and again.   Not gonna happen.
If you don like the congestion, put the blame where it belongs. Shady bad actors that blocked Bitcoin progress for years (hi Jihan), and are, yet again, spamming the blockchain with garbage blocks to clog it.
Saying we should "compromise" with these hostile attackers is the exact opposite of wise.
Bitcoin will be just fine.  We've seen such hostile takeover attempts from these yahoos many, many times.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:37:09
Not everyone has piles of cheap bandwidth.  Bitcoin needs to be available for as many people as possible. 
It is incredibly valuable to countries where governments crash and steal money from banks.  People's life savings gone.
Not with Bitcoin.  They can stash a good deal away where it cannot be touched by any centralized power.  
Doing away with that would be killing one of the most useful things about it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:53:08
What "dip"  first, second?  Makes no sense.
Bitcoin goes up and down... overall it climbs.
Zoom out a bit and look at all the millions of "dips" there have been.  
This is par for the course, nothing special.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:03:04
Yes, blocked by shady miners, not all of them.  Jihan and his band of gangsters to be exact.
There is no "narrative" here, except the "Big Blocks NOW!" bullshit that Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. are constantly trying to push.  They want more mining power centralization and less open range nodes. 
If you don't like the current situation, go complain to them.  They're the cause of it.  Tell Jihan to stop spamming the blockchain while you're at it.  Him n Ver hang out over at /btc,  so why don't you saunter back on over there now...
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:30:41
This sub doesn't censor. 
Trying to assert that rediculous theory is like saying the earth is flat.
You can go ahead and do that, just don't expect people to take you seriously.
The knowledgeable Bitcoin / Crypto fans in this sub do know what's up.
Talk about Ver's propaganda outlet (one of many on the web) /btc...  
cesspool of disinformation pushing Ver's latest scams. There, the censorship is real.
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:59:09
Very good example.  Bitcoin side-steps the middle man (banks) and gives you DIRECT control. 
One of the very best things about crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:24:55
Decentralization of mining power, as well as node distribution is vital for the success and longevity of Bitcoin.
High fees?  There is no way that high fees can centralize anything.  On the other hand, increasing block size would.
Take your blatant disinformation attempts back to /btc where you got them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:49:03
No, they never should have used "Bitcoin" at all.  This is very shady business and discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
The source code is open to copy and use for your *own* project. The parent project's resources are not.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:05:19
Might wanna offer a slight fee. 
Im not seeing those times at all, and paid a reàsonabe fee for $100 of BCH transfer. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:23:00
Never forget, Coinbase was in on the 2x scam, 
they also straight up said they would support Ver's hostile takeover attempt if it was successful. (meaning BCH, but they've shown they'd do the same for any attack)
They are not to be trusted.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:30:41
Indeed.  Zero need to panic. The price will climb back up again.
He didn't lose anything, he still has his Bitcoin, which will be worth more than he originally invested. Dude just needs to take a breath n sit tight.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:13:44
No it doesn't.  They want to willy-nilly increase block size until mining power is completely centralized, and node distribution equally in the hands of a tiny minority of already too powerful players.
Ver's latest scam coin has nothing to do with technological advancement. It is yet another get-rich-quick scheme. 
Besides that, the "dev team" that he can get to work for him is minuscule, and has proven themselves incompetent again and again.
The man is well known for using paid shills to promote his scams. Uses /btc as a launching ground for his propaganda and disinformation campaigns, as well as his scam site bitcoin.COM.
There is zero reason to increase block size until all the tech SegWit opens the door for has been explored.  And then, if it is nessicary, the bona fide Bitcoin dev team will do it,
not some tiny handful of incompetents controlled by gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:37:28
Only temporarily.  The price will go right back up soon enough.
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:37:27


Jones didn't harass anyone.  You're repeating baseless MSMedia lies that you haven't bothered to investigate yourself.
This is how they get people to support their blatant political censorship.
Jones is just one of the latest victims in a literal information war being waged on us. It seems to be effective, judging by how many people are blindly repeating their propaganda and disinformation as if it was truth.
@_date: 2019-07-21 15:27:13


LOLOLOLOL  
oh god,  that is hilarious.  They are a massive cesspool of propaganda and disinformation. Just one of Ver's many propaganda outlets on the internet. 
They constantly brigade and attack legitimate Bitcoin forums all over the web. 
Please don't spread such blatant disinformation.
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:12:15


The source is open, but trying to steal the name of an already established project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Cryptocurrency.
The abusive copycats here are not legit altcoins, they are attacks against everything Open Source stands for.
Just like Ver and his constant hostile takeover schemes. 
None of them have to do with the official Bitcoin Open Source project. 
Make your own name, own branding, offer *legitimate* competition, that is fully welcome!
No project that tries to steal the name / reputation of another is in any way worthy.  
If any of the yahoos pulling these get-rich-quick schemes had any merit, they'd contribute to actual Bitcoin.  Ver &amp; Co. have never contributed one line of code. IN fact they couldn't figure out how to increase block size!  o0
They have as little interest, as they do talent.  Laughable, but also dangerous.
None of the fakes listed are "contributing" anything positive. 
They are spitting in the face of everything Open Source stands for.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:43:37
No it didn't.  That's a lie.
You lot need to take your anti-bitcoin bullshit back to /btc where it comes from, or one of the other forums Ver uses to launch his propaganda.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:17:02
Didn't need to.   That type of anti-Bitcoin propaganda is constantly and consisantly seen every time Jihan, Ver &amp; Co push yet another scam.  BCH is only one more in a long line of them.
The whole scaling problem is one they, themselves created by blocking progress so long.  And we have to hear this ridiculous Big Bocks NOW! disinformation constantly, from people pushing their scams.
Their shills and astroturfers are a plague on legit crypto forums all over the web.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:12:30
Roger Ver you mean?  Scam artist extraordinaire for sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:05:25
The shady businesses that signed into Jihan's 2x scam anyway.  (hi Coinbase)
Shady bad actors are still trying to block progress.  :/
It's ok though, we've been through this all before.  Bitcoin is doing just fine, and now that those yahoos were forced to stop blocking SegWit, things can move forward.
@_date: 2018-09-22 04:39:43
Politics.  Purely partisan politics. 
It has nothing to do with their bullshit "reasons". This is pure, 100% political censorship. They are well known for it.
Yes, they have the "right" to do that, but they are hypocrites with zero integrity. They allow *actual* hate groups to use their service, because they agree with their politics.
Thankfully, we have Bitcoin to sidestep these abusive, monopolistic corporations.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:54:19
They'd be wise not to.  Not too much.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:43:22
Hating on Segwit?  No, the entire Bitcoin community, devs and trustworthy miners have been in support of Segwit all along.
There was a huge brigade of disinformation and propaganda pushing scams like BCH, 2x &amp; Co.
Such anti-Bitcoin propaganda gets pushed whenever Jihan, Ver &amp; Co come out with another scam. There's been a long line of them.
Coinbase was fully in support of Ver's BCH hostile takeover attempt. They are not to be trusted. :(
Segwit, and all the exciting scaling tech it opens the door for, is the way forward.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:03:32
The high fees are for the most part the fault of the very scam artists pushing thier Big Blocks NOW! propaganda.
Jihan and his shady mining outfits spamming the blockchain with garbage to clog the mempool is a huge factor.
Then they send in their shills to spew nonsense about how handing them even more power, by willy-nilly increasing block size, is somehow, magically, a good idea.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:27
This is a much more accurate analogy of the situation.
An even more accurate one would be that Ver is trying to hijack the good name and reputation of a completely separate Open Source project.  Shady shady business.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:06:03
That is a roadmap to disaster. No thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:21:16
bitcoin is doing just fine. 
What is annoying is all the crap promoting yet another scam by Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, and their ridiculous Big Blocks NOW! FUD.
Legit crypto forums all over the web are, indeed, attacked, every time they launch another round of anti-bitcoin disinformation and propaganda. :(
They were the ones blocking SegWit so long. Now that it's free to move forwards, there's no reason to talk about block size. Yet we're still constantly bombarded with that crap, in a lame attempt to promote Ver's BCH scam.
A lot of the problem we're seeing with congestion is caused by just these yahoos too, spamming garbage blocks.  We've seen it all too often before.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:44:44


Obviously sarcastic (or completely idiotic) to those in the know,
but shit ain't funny.  We see crap like this all the time, and a newbie will take you seriously.  
Don't do that please. If you insist, don't be surprised if you're taken as a shill / propaganda agent for Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
Legit crypto forums on reddit, and all over the internet, get brigaded regularly with just such nonsense. 
Every time Jihan, Ver &amp; Co push another scam. (XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCH, 2x...)
@_date: 2018-09-22 04:36:11


This is rediculous spin.  He was talking about a political battle of words, wrapped in the flowery metaphor of an old-west gun fight.
Nobody in their right mind would think he actually meant shooting a real gun. Well, except some corrupt MSMedia that tried to spin it that way, and people that repeat their bullshit.
This type of disinformation / propaganda isn't directly censorship, but it is above and beyond.  
Whatever you think of AJ, he didn't break any ToS. He was kicked off of a group of monopolistic social media platforms purely as an act of political censorship. 
Now paypal is doing the same thing, for purely political reasons. 
Yes, they have the "right" to do that, but it is still very slimy and shows they have no integrity or honesty.
Jones is just one of the latest victims in this war on American citizens waged by left leaning media / companies. This has been going on for quite a while now. Jones was just a high profile case.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:30:01
Oh god, take that crap back to /bch where you got it.. err I mean /btc... same damn thing.
Bitcoin is doing just fine, would be much better without constant attacks from Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, and a band of shady miners spamming garbage blocks, desperately trying to promote their "Big Blocks NOW!" nonsense.
No, these yahoos have been denied their grab for even more mining power centralization over and over, which is just what willy-nilly increasing block size would do.
Safe and sane scaling solutions are in the works.  Turning over even more power to bad actors would be insanity.
If you don't like the congestion Bitcoin is seeing, go complain to the source of it... Jihan's shady mining outfits, and Ver's scamcoin pushers... they were the ones that blocked progress so long. They're the ones still fighting against it now, for their own selfish gain. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:52:49


Oh, so like Fiat?  Yup.
This means nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:42:40
Seriously,  can this little dip please stay low until payday?
Not a huge difference, but every little bit helps.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:54:48
Trying to get "more space" by haphazardly increasing block size is no solution.  That would just increase mining power centralization, which is the *very* obvious reason gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are constantly pushing for just that.
Not gonna happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:53:26
Oh, the motives are very, very clear.  BCH is just another in a long line of scams from Ver, Jihan and their cronies.
They want another centrally controlled payment system. There is no technical credibility in their projects, and they have zero interest in honest competition.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:09:28
Without decentralization, you may as well just use a bank, or Visa, or any number of other centralized payment systems out there. (such as BCH btw).
The key factor that makes Bitcoin so valuable and useful is decentralization.  
Please, learn the first thing about Crypto in general, and Bitcoin in specific, before you come into a legit crypto forum repeating Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's anti-bitcoin propaganda. 
btw, running a full node is incredibly valuable. It lets you validate your own transactions. Very smart thing to do.  It also strengthens the network.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:44:45
Nobody was begging for the 2x scam except for gangsters like Ver, Jihan &amp; Co. 
Everyone that that actually knows a bit about Crypto saw that shit as the scam it was. 
Just like Bcash, Classic, Umlimited, XT, bct1..…. Long line of get rich quick scams with no tech worth. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:44:06
Thank goodness for that. 
Still, the point stands, the blatant hypocrisy is real.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:20:02
We are. The entire Bitcoin &amp; crypto &amp; open souce community, as well as worthy mining outfits. 
People who matter know that Ver is a scam artist. 
Keep the knowledge flowing, and let the Dev team get on with progress that matters. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:35:53
Ver is well known for paying for astroturfing to promote his scams. BCH is no different.  :(
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:59:32
If it was needed, Bitcoin devs would do it. 
Very hardly has a Dev team for his scam BCH.
We're not going to bigger blocks because it is not the best solution, and has many, many dangers.  
Has nothing to do with Ver's scam coinn, or Jihan's shady mining outfits. 
Though, larger blocks would benefit them, to Bitcoin's detriment. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:32:20


That never happened. That is just more propaganda and disinformation from the same people pushing the censorship. 
All Jones said was that there were some very fishy things about the official story. TONS of people were saying that, and there are absolutely big questions that are still left unanswered.
Jones said, many times, that he believes people died that day. 
The MSM try every way they can to spin what he said into something horrible. They are the real criminals here.
Please actually research the situation before you go repeating corrupt MSMedia lies.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:43:14
On the other hand, Bitcoin is the most technologically worthy, and the one with the most longevity and security.
Scams like BTC are a joke... Ver's scam coin hardly even has a dev team.  It's a pump-n-dump tool, nothing else.
There are legitimate altcoins.  For instance, Litecoin has a strong technological base and decent development, but little market and adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:00:33
Oh, people listen.  There is just a very loud minority of paid shills and the newbies Ver has duped.
The entire Bitcoin communtiy, trustworthy miners, and smart businesses have been saying the same thing.
Only get-righ-quick scam artists such as Ver, Jihan &amp; Co, and their goons pushing their scams, say otherwise.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:26:40
It was that way with every scam that Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. have pushed.  There have been many.
Xt, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, BCash... there will be more.
Fortunately, these get-rich-quick schemes are getting easier and easier to spot.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:51:49
Bullshit. Jihan and his uncrupulous mining outfits are a major cause of the clogged up mempool. 
They regularly produce garbage blocks , especially when Ver launches another round of propaganda for one of his scams. 
BCH is only the latest in a long line of them. 
Part of that propaganda and disinformation is them pushing their Big Blocks NOW! spam. 
Handing over even more mining centralization to those yahoos is no answer. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 07:16:48


bingo.  If you still have the bitcoin, you haven't lost anything.
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:18:51


False.  That is just more propaganda and disinformation from the same abusive people behind such censorship.
This biased political censorship has been going on for quite a while. Jones is just one of the latest (high profile) victims.
These abusive, monopolistic corporations constantly and consistently censor right-leaning views, while blatantly allowing / promoting actual hate speech from leftists.
The same 5 or so companies that own pretty much all of our corrupt corporate MSMedia, also have enormous influence over these social media monopolists (FB, Twitter, Google, etc..).
They are, and have been, waging a literal information war against the American people, and the world.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:48:36
Bcash is a scam coin.  All exchanges should have dumped that garbage as soon as it hit the market.
Good on Mex for doing the right thing, though it could have been sooner.  
Shame on other unscrupulous exchanges for supporting the BCH hostile takeover attempt.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:02:44
It isn't so much disagreement with the paper itself...
it is how it is constantly used to promote scams and hostile takeover attempts from Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
The arguments presented have no technical merit, they only are spreading anti-Bitcoin disinformation and propaganda in promoting scams from shady bad actors.
Same as when you hear them going on about programming being "decentralized", when that jargon, in the context of Crytpo, refers only to mining power and node distribution.
So yah, the white paper is fine, using it to promote hostile takeover attempts, naturally is looked down on.
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:49:30


It has fuck all to do with good business decisions. It is blatant political censorship, pure and simple. 
Yes it is (currently) legal, and yes, they are hypocritical assholes for doing it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:56:41
Ok, so go use Ver's latest scam coin if you don't like it.  While you're at it, tell him to have his buddy Jihan stop spamming the blockchain with garbage. 
Oh, but then you'd actualyl have to *DO* something... and you want things to just be fixed.
You realize, even if the devs were idiotic enough to willy nilly increase block size, you'd also have to *do* something to take advantage of that.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:40:59
Talk about hate-fuled politics!
Go back to /politics where such hatred and disinformation belongs.
This place is for Bitcoin. Take yer own advice.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:59:46
Oh, they CAN implement SegWit.  Why coinbase hasn't yet is pretty obvious.  They did sign that 2x bullshit, and said they'd support Ver's BCH attack if it was successful. They're not to be trusted.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:53:06
It most likely won't.  There's no reason to even discuss this rediculous "Big Blocks NOW!" crap.
SegWit is activated, and we have safe and sane scaling tech to explore.
Willy nilly increasing block size would put even more power in Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's hands, which is why they are pushing so desperately for it.
Not gonna happen.   
IF, somewhere down the line, it is decided, then the Bitcoin dev team will do it,  safely, carefully, and not because of threats and attacks. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:31:23
Yes,  BCH is wide open because it has no real protection against it.
What they call protection is purely opt-in, which is no protection at all.
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:47:39


And everyone else has a right to call them out for being hypocritical assholes for their blatant political censorship. 
They allow all manner of *actually harmful* organizations to use their service, just because they agree with their politics, and get all ban-happy with right-leaning views.
This company has zero integrity.  Thankfully we do have Bitcoin to sidestep such horrendous abuse, but Bitcoin isn't anywhere near being a replacement yet. :(
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:29:23

You want the .ORG one.  
Beware of the "bitcoin".COM scam site! It has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:53:22
BCH, like so many other of Ver's scams, is nothing but a get-rich-quick scheme.  Short term is right.
That garbage hardly even has a dev team.  There's no future or technological value in it. 
We've seen this many times before with Ver's scam coins.  Classic, Unlimited, and him being mixed up in Jihan's btc1 and 2x scams...
They make a little blip, spread tons of disinformation and propaganda, but are shady as all get-out from the start.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:38:58
Hahaha. 
BCH is a scam. It hardly has a dev team.  Take your Vercoin spam back to /bch where it belongs. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:24:34
Right, so they should never have offered trading Ver's hostile takeover attempt BCH in the first place.
THAT would have been ethical.
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:19:29


This is absurd propaganda from the same people behind the censorship.

@_date: 2017-12-21 05:53:02
Many people like Ver, Jihan, and other gangsters. 
People that actually are FOR Bitcoin saw thorough that shit from the start. 
Block increase brings more mining centralization.  Zero reason to even discuss it now that those asshats have been forced to stop blocking progress. 
SegWit, lightning &amp; Co are the future. 
Wanna talk about bad development?  Look at the disaster that Ver's scam coins are. BCH is only his latest scam. None have any worth. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:33:58


The "people" you're talking about are shady scam artists like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
They attack Open Source, Crypto, and specifically Bitcoin consistently and almost constantly.  
It has nothing to do with Crypto and Bitcoin itself, except as a sign of its success, being valuable enough to try for hostile takeovers against.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, BCH... a long line of shady get-rich quick schemes.
Bitcoin has survived them all, and just keeps on chugging onward and upwards.
So your big dream is still alive, just be aware there is a lot of propaganda and disinformation coming from bad actors, trying to say otherwise.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:44:08
Those actually have logic behind them though.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:23:04
POW change would fix the fees. Or gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co stop attacking Bitcoin,
or, we hlod tight and enjoy watching tech like Lightning &amp; Co unfold organically. 
Quick fixes lead to disasters like Ver's latest scam coin BCH. Safety and longevity are far more important.

"those that weren't"  aka,  the unscurpulous miners under Jihan's thumb,  or corporate interests that Ver collected.
none of those poeple have the slightest interest in the longevity and usefulness of Bitcoin, or cryppto in general really.
They spit in the face of Open Source also.  
Please, inform yourself before you go reapeating their bullshit.
None of their scams have any shred of technilogical merit, nor integrity in the blatant disinformation campaigns they empoy to push them.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, BTC, 2x ...   A long line of complete bullshit with dev "teams" so laughably inept, they could not even increase the block size.  
If you have something positive to say about thses yahoos, please, show us some semblance of reason and link to a credible source,
because your assertion that anyone in the Crypto, or Open Source Community,  were FOR these scams,  is akin to claiming that the moon is made of green cheese.
Jihan, Ver, and their cohorts have done nothing but attack Crypto and Open Source.  They are working directly *against* such communities. They are no part of them.
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:42:21


Yes, currently they do.
And everyone else has the right to call them out for the abusive, hypocritical assholes they are for doing it.
In fact, it could reasonably be argued that their blatant political censorship is causing direct harm to America.

It is absolutely both.

The shady gangster Jihan Wu is all wrapped up in Ver's latest scam coin BCH.  
Bitmain is Jihan's darling, and just as shady. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:37:23
Except for the things you hear on legit crypto forums like /bitcoin and others all over the web actually are based on logic, reason and reality.
The crap promoting scams like BCH are not.  There is zero comparison.

He never did that.  Stop repeating MSM lies.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:43:10
BCH is a centrally controlled scam coin run by the gangster Roger Ver. 
It hardly even has a dev team. There is zero comparison. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:40:36
Can corrupt, bad actors stop launching such hostile takeover attempts such as BCH?
Sadly, these are not idiots, they know *exactly* what they are doing. :(
The ones that support such are working directly *against* Crypto, and Open Source.  You do realize that, don't you?  If not, you need to inform yourself about both.
We ALL know coinbase said they would fully support the BCH attack if it was successful. There is no denying that. This implies they support any hostile takeover attempt, as long as THEY can profit from it. Coinbase is not to be trusted.
 
Segwit has been supported by trustworthy mining institutes, and the Bitcoin community, from the start. There is some *reasonable* discussion about the details. NONE of it includes abusive disinformation promoting max block size increases.  That would be madness.
Willy-nilly increasing max block size only encurages more mining power centralization.  That is why gangsters such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co push for it so hard.
BCH, 2x, Unlimited, Classic, XT.... a whole long line of SCAMS these gangsters are behind.  We've seen all too many of them.  We'll see more.  Fortunately, they're getting easier and easier to spot.
None of them have anything to do with Bitcoin, they are just trying to steal its name and resources.   
Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have not contributed one line of code to the Bitcoin project. They only attack it, and its community.


oh god.  boatloads.   Again, you are saying the moon is made of green cheese.
Either learn the first thing about Open Source, and Crypto, or get back to BTC where you can repeat their bullshit ad absurdum.   People here do know what is going on, and the actual, factual threat that the thing you are attempting to promote entails. You need to learn it to,  or don't be surprised if you arn't wlcome with open arms.
This is the type of bullshit Crypto has had to deal with from scams from Ver, Jihan, and their cronies:
It has been known for a long time that this latest scam of Roger Ver's (xt, classic, now unlimited) have no technological value.
This latest attempt, Unlimited coin, is written by a handful of completely incompetent "devs", as has been abundantly demonstrated, again and again! The links below are *just a beginning*.
The Bitcoin Community is well aware, and nobody in their right mind will turn Bitcoin over to this snake oil salesman Ver and his ridiculously broken software teams. Not to mention the shady mining concerns (hello Jihan &amp; Co) that supported it before it became so blatantly obvious that it was Dead On Arrival.
Some background on the dangers of this Unlimited nonsense:
[These three well written articles by Aaron van Wirdum explain BU's 'Emergent Consensus' (spoiler alert - it's got issues)](
Even more damning, a complete rundown of the blatant, wilful scam that is Unlimited:
Thanks to for this excellent writeup, and plethora of linked sources:
[**The Astounding Incompetence, Negligence, and Dishonesty of the Bitcoin Unlimited Developers**](
As if that was not enough!  (thanks to for the excellent writeup and links.)
Add to this the [Damning evidence on how Bitcoin Unlimited pays shills.]( 
Roger Ver has no shred of integrity, honesty or trustworthiness in him. He and his cohorts such as Jihan &amp; Co are shunned with extreme prejudice by the Bitcoin and Crypto community, as well as Open Source in general, for for their destructive practices.
Just as his latest hijacking attempt, Unlimited is, Jihan's 2x hijack attempt is, 
as well as the cesspools of disinformation and propaganda they use to organize their paid brigading (hello /btc).
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:14:26
Well, definitely working for Ver, that's obvious.
Doubt Ver would spend the time himself. He's well known for using paid shills / astroturfers to promote his scams.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:23:39
Turning the scam BCH into something of value is very ethical.
Other exchanges should have done the same. 
Shady outfits that signed onto Jihan's takeover scheme 2x are not to be trusted, and those trying to push Ver's BCH takeover attempt even less so.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:28:17
You lot get back to /btc to push Ver's scam coin BCH.
You have your own forum for that crap.
Any exchange that deals in such hostile takeover attempts is not to be trusted.
Those that promote such scams either.
@_date: 2018-09-15 21:08:11
Bcash is not a legitimate altcoin, nor a legit fork. 
It has zero value as a cryptocurrency.
What it is is another scam, the latest in a long like from Ver, Jihan &amp; Co.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:41:47
10-20%??  Dude, this, and other legit crypto forums are getting hit with yet another wave of "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda.  Hard.
It's very predictable too. Ver has been spewing his bullshit publicly again, making another push for his latest scam coin.
The vast majority of the crap we hear about "concerns" have little to no logic behind them, simply demanding bigger blocks, with no thought as to the danger that brings with it.
And if pointed out, quickly degenerate into shit slinging... sometimes they just start flinging shit right off the bat, such as:


@_date: 2018-09-01 08:19:07

This offer has just as much legitimacy as Ver's attempted hostile takeover of another Open Source project.  Zero, naturally.
Unfortunately, he's actually fooling people with his scam coin. :(
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:38:08
He can't even get decent programmers to work for him. 
Ver is a snake oil salesman, nothing else. 
@_date: 2018-09-15 21:09:10
Bcash has always been centralized.  There are only a tiny minority mining that scam. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:35:25
Yes, dumped the scamcoin BCH,
like every trustworthy exchange should have done immediately after the attack launched.
Anyone that didn't dump that garbage after the split is just asking for trouble.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:47:04
No you did not.  People blather on constantly about all types of altcoins here.  Especially when Ver is pushing another scam coin like BCH.  
The mods here are tollerant almost to a fault.  You have to go WAY against the sub rules to get a comment deleted, let alone 
banned.  
Get real.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:11:29
So, your idea of a "resolution" is to put even more power in the hands of already too large, unscrupulous mining outfits under Jihan's control.  
No thanks. Not gonna happen.  That is no solution at all.
@_date: 2018-09-22 04:43:31
See the horrendously biased and abusive political censorship practiced by Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, Google in general...
They constantly and consistently censor right leaning views, while allowing all manner of actual hate speech from left leaning people and organizations.
Yes, they have the right to do this (debatable), but everyone also has the right to call them on their hypocrisy and total lack of integrity. They are literally waging an information war against the population at large. Jones is just one of the latest victims. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:29:05
Good point.  Also, don't forget that Ver only has a tiny handful of incompetent devs working for him.
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust anything of worth to a handful of devs under the control of a shady gangster.  Well, not unless they're in on the scam themselves too.

False.  That is just more biased spin, propaganda, disinformation from the same people behind the censorship.
At the same time, they allow left-leaning organizations and individuals to participate in all manner of *actual* hate speech on their platforms.
They may have a legal right to their politically biased censorship, but it clearly shows their obvious lack of integrity and abusive hypocrisy.
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:13:24
It is not rediculous or far fetched at all.
Quite the opposite. Big heads of these abusive, monopolistic social media corporations had just had a big meeting shortly before they all, suddenly, decided to censor Jones.
It would be far fetched to think they did NOT collude on the censorship.
@_date: 2018-09-22 05:31:09


Rights have nothing to do with censorship.
Paypal has the right to censor Jones.
Everyone else has the right to call them out for their blatant hypocrisy and total lack of integrity too.
They allow all manner of *actually* harmful left-leaning organizations to use their service, because they agree with their politics.
Yes, it is legal for them to do this, and yes, it is slimy as fuck.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:50:00

BCH is in no way a legitimate fork, nor altcoin.
It is a scam, pur and simple.  It has no use as a cryptocurrency, just another of Ver's get-rich-quick schemes.
IF these yahoos wanted actual competition, they'd use their own name and blockchain.
They have neither the interest, nor the capability of making anything of worth themselves, so they try to steal the name of an existing project and fool people.  This is a scam, not a cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:12:44
To celebrate the latest scam coin.  
The only thing rabid here are your disinformation and blatant propaganda. 
The only thing irrational is you lot thinking you won't get called out for trying to hijack the name and reputation of an already existing project.

Err.. no.
Jihan and his shady Chinese mining outfits were blocking SegWit for years, until...
the Bitcoin community threatened them with a UASF. Telling Jihan &amp; goons to shape up or they'd be shipped out.
They shaped up.  
Oh, Jihan tried some silly 2x bullshit, of course, but that was DOA, as well as his buddy Ver's BCH scam. Though the latter did get some corrupt corporate investment.
In the end, the corrupt miners were shown they don't run the show.  The reputable mining outfits celebrated loudest in the Bitcoin community,  and Jihan, Ver and their /btc shills are still butthurt.
@_date: 2018-08-20 01:47:41

@_date: 2018-08-02 15:32:26
It is absolutely a scam.  You don't just go and hijack the name and other resources of another open source project.
This kind of fuckery is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of open source, not just crypto.
Ver's scam isn't even a legitimate cryptocurrency.  He has no dev team to speak of, and the ones he can get to work for him, work for him.
There is only one Bitcoin open source project, and Ver and his long line of scam coins have nothing to do with it, except constantly attacking it.

@_date: 2018-08-02 16:28:35
We've seen so many of Ver's get-rich-quick scams come down the line, they are very easy to spot.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, mixed up in Jihan's btc1 and x2 scams, and now BCH.  None of them have any worth as legit cryptocurrencies, and spit in the face of everything Open Source stands for.
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:22:14
BCH isn't a legitimate altcoin.  It has no use as a crypto, just as yet another get-rich-quick scam.
We've seen a long line  of such attacks by Ver &amp; Co.
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:25:12
You know you're dealing with one of Ver's shills when they start trying to confuse decentralization with software.
No, in the context of crypto, decentralization refers to mining power and node distribution, NOT software.
There is only one Open Source Bitcoin project. Deal with it.
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:23:55


Proving, yet again, your complete and total disregard for all that is holy in Open Source.
Shady behavior like this alone proves you've got zero integrity.  Just like Ver's scam coin you're trying to promote.
If you were interesting in "improving Bitcoin" you wouldn't be trying to hijack its resources.  You'd submit code.  That would be fully worthy.  You have zero interest in Bitcoin except to scam people into thinking your darling BCH is somehow a part of it.

equal chance of getting 10% more.  It all evens out, and really, we're on a pretty steady, slow upward climb.
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:21:26


This shows an absolute and complete disdain for everything Open Source is based on.  You do NOT go stealing the name and other resources of an already established project.
Not if you are interested in having any shred of credibility or integrity. 
Obviously, neither the shady devs behind this scammy app, nor the corrupt corporate scam artist Ver have any interest in such.
Also, there is zero need to use the moniker "core".  There is only one Open Source Bitcoin project. It is named simply Bitcoin.
This is in no way a matter of simple opinion. It is industry wide standards / best practices.  
Propaganda like you're spewing here is only making it more obvious what a scam this app is.
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:45:09
It has long been one of Ver's propaganda outlets.  BCH is only the latest in a long line of his scam coins.  /btc is pretty much his, and has been for a long time.

They are not to be trusted.  The less people use that garbage company, the better.
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:21:20
All Ver does is deliberately attempt to mislead.
He has neither the interest, nor the capability of creating a legitimate altcoin, so he constantly tries to hijack another already established project.
BCH is a scam from the start, and apps that try to pull a fast one like this are as shady as he is.
@_date: 2018-05-01 11:11:48
No, you're talking about the open source Bitcoin project. 
There is zero need for the "core". Only the scam artists Ver, Jihan &amp; Co. Insist on naming it that. 
Bitcoin is simply Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:16:44
Calling out a blatant scam for being a scam (BCH) is in no way "regulation".

This, and other legit crypto subs all over the web, are constantly bombarded with Ver's corporate shills. Massive disinformation brigades pushing his latest scam coin.  BCH is only the latest in a long line.
We've seen it all before, far too often.  Nobody that knows the first thing about how Cryptocurrency works is duped into Ver's scams. 
BCH scamcoin has no worth as a crypto. It has a laughably small, and incompetent dev team.
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:14:49
Fully under roger Ver's control, tries to steal the name and other resources of an already established project. Scams people, fooling them into believing they are getting bona fide Bitcoin.
BCH hardly has a dev team. It is worthless as a crypto. It isn't even a legit altcoin. It is just another in a long line of Ver's scam coins.  
We've seen it so many times before.
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:26:16
Why would anyone want to talk to the scam artists that wrote this piece of shit app?
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:00:44


Legitimate altcoins use the code, but make their OWN project.
Bona fide competition is a Good Thing and is fully encouraged.
What is discouraged, with extreme prejudice, in all of Open Source, is shady outfits trying to hijack the name and other resources (blockchain in this case) of an already established project.
The Source Code is open,  but the resources of an Open Source project belong exclusively to that project.
What Ver does constantly and consistently is try to scam people by calling his get-rich-quick schemes "Bitcoin"... thou he's never made one pull request.. never submitted a line of code to the Bitcoin open source project.
Trying to hijack the name, reputation and resources of an already established project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just crypto.
BCH is not a fork, it is not an altcoin, it has no use as a legit cryptocurrency.  It is only another of Ver, Jihan &amp; Co.'s hostile takeover attempts.
We've seen this so many times..  XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, X2, and the latest is BCH aka bCash.  
IF Ver had an interest in *actual* comptition, he'd make a real altcoin.  
He has no such interest, and is not capable of such.  The yahoos he can get to work for him couldn't even figure out how to increase block size!  And the tiny dev team working for him on BCH,  is working purely for him.
Nobody in their right mind would invest any value in Ver's scams, unless they were duped by his lies &amp; anti-bitcoin propaganda, or were looking to profit from the scam themselves. 
Again, Ver constanty spits in the face of everything Open Source stands for.  Zero integrity, and the whole crypto community knows it very well.
This isn't the only legit crypto forum that gets spammed with his shit.  The scam site bitcoin.COM is a SCAM site.
/btc here constanty promotes all his crap, and other bad actors like btc.COM are no better.
There is one Open Source Bitcoin project.  Only one.  And it is chugging right alone, despite all their attempted abuse. :)

@_date: 2018-08-13 17:25:42


Yes, though BCH is not a legitimate fork in any way shape or form.
It is not a bona fide altcoin, it is simply another of Ver's hostile takeover attempts.
Nobody in their right mind is going to invest anything of worth in a coin with no dev team, and the idiots he *can* get to work for him, work for him.
Only people that are in on the scam are investing, or the poor victims they've fooled.

You have zero argument.  Nothing that has not been debunked again, and again and again,  every time Ver tries to push another of his hostile takeover attempts.
You have presented no worthy argument here whatsoever. If anything, you've just dug the hole deeper.
Your remarks show an extreme disrespect for the Open Source, Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin communities.

Shady behavior like this is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
Ver has never contributed one line of code to the Bitcoin project. BCH is in no way Bitcoin, it is an attack on it.
If he had any shred of credibility, he would not try to steal the name and other resources (blockchain) of an already established project.  Shady, shady shit there bub.
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:30:25

Don't even try.  You know exactly what the problem is.  Trying to hijack the name Bitcoin, and scam people into thinking your trash has anything to do with the bona fide Bitcoin project.
Despicable, detestable behavior. You spit in the face of everything Open Source is about.

Very careful attention is needed when someone claims something like this.  Who is behind this "news"?

Just perfectly described the /btc sub, and the brigades shilling for Ver's scam BCH.  
@_date: 2018-05-07 00:57:53
Ver has no "Why" behind his constant scams, except his own selfish interests.  
His "coins" he constantly attacks the Open Source community with, specifically Crypto, and very specifically Bitcoin, show Ver has zero interest in healty, honest competition.
He is consistantly trying to steal the good name and resources of an already established Open Source project.
This is disgusting behavior, discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
Ver's "why" as you put it, is nonsense and his actions completely anti-social, anti-Open Source, and most of all, anti-Bitcoin. 
**BCH is the same get rich quick crap as Ver, Jihan &amp; Co's other get rich quick schemes before it:**
It has been known for a long time that this latest scam of Roger Ver's (xt, classic, now unlimited) have no technological value.
This latest attempt, Unlimited coin, is written by a handful of completely incompetent "devs", as has been abundantly demonstrated, again and again! The links below are *just a beginning*.
The Bitcoin Community is well aware, and nobody in their right mind will turn Bitcoin over to this snake oil salesman Ver and his ridiculously broken software teams. Not to mention the shady mining concerns (hello Jihan &amp; Co) that supported it before it became so blatantly obvious that it was Dead On Arrival.
Some background on the dangers of this Unlimited nonsense:
[These three well written articles by Aaron van Wirdum explain BU's 'Emergent Consensus' (spoiler alert - it's got issues)](
Even more damning, a complete rundown of the blatant, wilful scam that is Unlimited:
Thanks to for this excellent writeup, and plethora of linked sources:
[**The Astounding Incompetence, Negligence, and Dishonesty of the Bitcoin Unlimited Developers**](
As if that was not enough!  (thanks to for the excellent writeup and links.)
Add to this the [Damning evidence on how Bitcoin Unlimited pays shills.]( 
Roger Ver has no shred of integrity, honesty or trustworthiness in him. He and his cohorts such as Jihan &amp; Co are shunned with extreme prejudice by the Bitcoin and Crypto community, as well as Open Source in general, for for their destructive practices.
Just as his latest hijacking attempt, Unlimited is, Jihan's 2x hijack attempt is, 
as well as the cesspools of disinformation and propaganda they use to organize their paid brigading (hello /btc).
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:52:08
You're basically advocating dealing with hostage takers by a "construcive / creative, less toxic way"... 
Dude, get out with your concern trolling.  Ver, Jihan &amp; Co. have done nothing but attack Open Source, Crypto and Bitcoin this whole time.
They have no legitimate standing whatsoever.  They just want to willy-nilly incerase block size until they are the only ones in control of &gt;51% mining.  
Gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are a huge threat, and it is assinine to think they have any interest in your fantasy of "less toxic" with them.  They are the toxic itself.
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:37:25
To be fair, this adds nothing new to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:12:15
It's the same in the US.  The US government might have the longest arm right now, but are still only puppets to huge corporations and the international bankers. A tiny minority of super-wealthy parasites have bought our country's governments, and use them for their means with impunity.
Some political types might even fight against it, but that rarely ends well. Look at JFK, or even Snowden.

you mean lawless. Ver's "permission" to hijack the resources of another already established project are still denied.
Such destructive behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
If Ver could or would make a legit altcoin, own name, own blockchain, it would be welcome. Honest competition always is.
He has zero interest in such, nor is he capable of it.  As his long line of scamcoins clearly demonstrates:
xt, classic, unlimited, bch, also mixed up in Jihan's scams btc1 and x2.
Ver, Jihan &amp; co have made a career of attacking Open Source, Cryptocurrency, and specifically Bitcoin.
They have produced nothing of value, they have no dev team to speak of, only corrupt, corporate backed takeover schemes.
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust BCH with anything of value unless they've been duped by Ver's scam, or are part of it. :(
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:47:11

Screw the Bitcoin 'foundation'. They don't represent anyone but themselves. Stop talking to those parasites.
I see a need for some organization for meetings, particularly for the core devs, but I think they already have that.
Outside of that I think small groups are great, focusing on public relations (advertising) and such.
There is no and can never be a central organization representing bitcoin. Including, but not limited to these BFoundation idiots. Each one of us is for ourselves, and we like it that way!
@_date: 2018-05-09 06:14:11
That is an incredibly hostile attitude to people newly interested.
Sounds exactly like what Ver wants.  Nobody talk about his scam, so he can dupe more people into his latest. 
We've seen so many before from him, but this BCH is the most damaging. 
How many will innocently stray into the trap that is bitcoin.COM without any mention of it on legit crypto forums like this one.
Yah, there's not much else going on except the steady progress. When you see a new release, or breakthrough in the new tech SegWit now allows, promote the shit out of it!
In between though, the news is just trying to keep people from falling into Ver's scam coin.

Publicity campaigns like this get picked up by news agencies. The sensational destruction makes for good entertainment. It could just get some broader attention than Bitcoin fans and Apple haters. Definitely more than doing nothing.
There are probably a lot of other ways to bring attention to the problem, what would you suggest?

Go spend some time in the deep south of America first.
There are WAY too many Americans living way below the poverty line. There are, indeed, places here inside our very borders that are just as undeveloped, unhealthy, underprivileged, uneducated and downtrodden as in the so-called "3rd world".
Go look at the homeless problems in our biggest cities too! Every empty space is full of the rejects of our society. Then look at Europe. In my travels to Germany for instance, I was amazed at the ammount of empty buildings (E.Germany) but the shocking LACK of people in them. In a major metropolis in America, those buildings would be packed with the underprivileged. 
The thing that makes this so sad is the all-too-common patriotism some Americans have.  The ridiculous idea that we are doing SOOO well compared to "the rest". That is a dream you were told to believe. Throw your TV away.
We need to fix our own fucking problems before we go trying to fix other countries.
That is not even what our moderns "wars" are about though. Bringing "Freedom" to others is a big fat joke when our very own is so constantly under threat from the wealthy puppet masters that have bought our politicians. 
The true reason ALL people on this planet are suffering has no borders. There is a tiny minority of insanely ultra-wealthy parasites that control America, Europe and all your 3rd world countries. Entire nations suffer for their power / money addiction.
You suffer too, even in this Great Land of Amerika...  even if you don't yet realize. :(

err..  no reason to try to define bitcoin as anything other than bitcoin.
Bitcoin is an open source cryptocurrency project. One of, if not the, most successful one.
BU has zero legitimacy or integrity, and very little actual tallent. They've demonstrated that abundantly.  If they wanted to be taken seriously, they would offer a legitimate altcoin (which is what it is).
They cannot offer actual competition though, so they pour tons of corporate funding into disinformation and propaganda, pushing for a hostile takeover of an already successful project.
This kind of destructive behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of open source, not just cryptocurrency. 
Fortunately, people on legitimate cryptocurrency forums such as here (and many others all over the internet) are well aware of such shady scams.
The only irony is in trying to define legitimate disapproval of such hostile takeover attempts as "misunderstandings and lies", when BU &amp; Co. spend so much of their corporate-backed advertising budget on just that.
@_date: 2017-02-17 00:10:45

@_date: 2017-02-12 05:35:05
Oh crap, you seriously are trying to quote some ClassicCoin scam artist as a  "source"???!
That ClassicCoin hostile takeover attempt crashed and burned long ago, like so many others.
Exact same thing these BU yahoos are trying to pull. 
If they had any shred of legitimate worth integrity, or merit they would make a damn altcoin.
(which, is exactly what they are). They cannot, they can only try to rip off bitcoin.
*Actual* competition is good. if someone has a better idea, produces a better coin, we'd use it.
BUnlimited, ClassicCoin and other get-rich-quick scams, actively try to hurt bitcoin *for profit*.
They have nothing to do with bitcoin. Such destructive takeover attempts must be (and are) shunned.
Open source means the *source* is open, not other project's resources (i.e. name, blockchain)
Trying to steal the resources of another project is discouraged with extreme prejudice
throughout the entire open source community!

1. The mods of this sub are the opposite of heavy handed.
2. Any project attempting a malicious takeover of another project's resources is discouraged with extreme prejudice in Open Source, not just cryptocurrency.
What you say about UnlimitedCoin, and that cesspool /btc's blatant disinformation campaigns, are completely correct,
and yes, this shit needs to stop.  Unfortunately, it won't. As long as bitcoin is successful, we'll have get-rich-quick scams like BU, ClassicCoin, and these yahoos VIA, trying to associate themselves with the Bitcoin project.
They have nothing to do with Bitcoin whatsoever, except for their attempt to hijack it.

Which will never happen. 
BU is nothing but a hostile takeover attempt.
If they had any chance, they'd make an altcoin (what it actually is) and offer real competition.  
They cannot, so they try to steal the name and resources of an already successful project.
Nobody in thier right mind  is going to turn bitcoin over to a handful of shady-as-hell devs,

The only thing politically motivated here, is the downright shit-slinging demonstrated in your original post.
That the moderators actually allowed this, after it was obviously caught by the spam filter, makes your entire concern-troll in this thread completely ludicrous. 
Personally, I'd have left it deleted, and given you a temporary ban for continuing attempts at spreading blatant propaganda. 
The mods here are much more tolerant than I am, which, again, makes such screams of "CENSORSHIP!" even more absurd.

SegWit is the sane and rational answer.

There was never any plan to fork bitcoin just to increase block size. 
That would be insanity without protections in place against the further mining power centralization it would encourage.
@_date: 2017-02-10 21:30:15
Decentralization in the context of cryptocurrency has to do with mining power, nothing else.
There is no "decentralization of development". 
If BU (and other such get-rich-quick scams) wanted to have any semblance of legitimacy, they'd straight up make an altcoin (which is what it is).  But no, they choose to attempt to steal the resources of an already established project.

No. Fiat will most likely always exist. It does have its uses.

If they are successful in their scam and hostile takeover attempt...
I don't see any point in calling that "success". 
The entire BU thing is a train wreck, 
and we've seen way too much spam here from such get-rich-quick projects.
You hear much more here about ClassicCoin?  They crashed and burned too, 
as will UnlimitedCoin, like so many other scams before it.
@_date: 2017-02-12 06:04:55
Incompatible with WHAT exactly?
there is no reason to even use the "core" descriptor.
You are talking about bitcoin.  
A project trying to steal anther's resources is incompatible. 
Classic was incompatible. It died, for damn good reason.
BU is incompatible, and oh hell it needs to disappear.
They were  both fatally flawed from the start, or they'd have made a pull request with real code to the ACTUAL bitcoin project and been merged.
They were not, and will not be. Again, for damn good reason.
@_date: 2017-02-16 20:12:10
It's irrelevant how.  Why is very obvious.
We've seen all too many get-rich-quick schemes lately.
They aren't worth the effort to figure out why. Personally I say such blatant spam needs to be axed, but the mods here are extremely tolerant.
@_date: 2017-02-14 05:38:42
Blocksize is already too large, and mining power already too centralized. Simply increasing the one with no protections against the other invites disaster.

@_date: 2017-02-18 20:28:50
Case in point.  Huge mining concerns in favor of such disastrous bullshit are to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
A few years back there were mining pools that came close to that critical 51%, and showing their integrity, they split up, encouraging their members to pick smaller groups.
That type of behavior is respectable and shows a true comitment to cryptocurrency.
We see exactly the opposite from shady operations like these "btc.top" yhoos, and the outfits they promote, such as "ClassicCoin", "Unlimited", and so many other scams we've seen go through.
They have nothing to do with bitcoin, they just want a quick dollar.
@_date: 2017-02-10 21:10:31
Yes.  Max block size is already too large.
SegWit is the safe and secure way to go.
@_date: 2016-03-23 17:29:33
You have some reading to do.  
Maybe Segwit isn't the answer. This is still being discussed. It is the best alternative to date I've read about.
What definitely is NOT the answer is turning over the bitcoin blockchain to some tiny handful of derisive devs that want to instantly double or quadruple blocksize with zero protections in place. That would be pure folly.

Bitcoin is not a replacement for fiat.

Don't like Bitcoin? Use another altcoin, or start your own.
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:54:01
There was no HK "agreement", and SegWit allows the equivalent of bigger blocks without the massive risk of further centralization of mining power that simply increasing max block size would.
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:40:35
There is zero reason to list UnlimitedCoin alongside Bitcoin.
They have nothing to do with each other.

Well, leading in that they are the latest get-rich-quick scheme of the month.
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:25:03
Get-rich-quick artists that have zero interest in bitcoin's longevity or success. 
We've seen their corporate-funded disinformation and propaganda  all over the internet. 
Fortunately, they are easy to spot, and are discouraged with extreme prejudice on legitimate cryptocurrency forums, including this one.
The mods here are incredibly tolerant, and allow all but the most blatant and dangerous spam  to stay, but people here know what's up, and point it out regularly when cesspools like /btc brigade.

We've had enough nonsense here. There is hardly ever a rational reason, just more shit-slinging, as this entire thread is designed for.
Competition is good, but Bitcoin really is still the only game in town, and it is ridiculous to attest that "most" believe the opposite. What SammieData is asserting is simply false from all sides.

Keeping spam off the sub is not censorship. 
There are projects with zero chance of taking over that spent way too much advertising money clogging up bonafied bitcoin forums (this sub included).
At that point it is simply a hostile takeover attempt, disruptive and spreads disinformation. By all rights, such threads should be deleted as they appear.
There is plenty of intelligent discussion on any number of altcoins, so no, there is no censorship here, only good and proper moderation.
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:15:45
/btc is a cesspool of disinformation and get-rich-quick scams.

No actually, it just is talking about mining.
There is lots of FUD, blatant disinformation being spread. This is some of it.
People trying to make their project's attempted hijack of the bitcoin blockchain look like something good use the word wrongly to confuse people. That's all.
Decentralization is a term referring to mining power. Don't trust anyone that says differently.
@_date: 2016-03-28 15:55:50
Please stop spreading such disinformation.
Possibly you were not aware, but now you are.
Using technical jargon falsely like in the title is bad for bitcoin.

Spreading disinformation and FUD is welcome over in /btc. We suggest you return there now.

@_date: 2016-03-23 14:21:02
Turning over the bitcoin blockchain to a tiny handful of dissenting devs, no matter how deep the pockets of their corporate backers, would indeed be very bad for bitcoin.
An effective takeover? That depends on the true motivation behind it. To destroy Bitcoin as it is would be the result. To warp it into something more like fiat would be inevitable at that point, and everyone looses, except for the fat cats behind the destruction.
@_date: 2016-03-31 17:51:47
Larger blocks would be an *advantage* to huge mining farms, not a disadvantage.
The threat of too much mining power being centralized by one group or player is a big one. 
This is why we need to have protections in place before we go just upping blocksize indiscriminately.
And yes, respectable miners are fine with this.
@_date: 2016-03-24 13:13:21
This is a prime example of the destructive type of shit-sliinging that has been going on the last months on bitcoin forums.
Zero content, childish shaming attempts.  Obvious spam that has zero place in any serious forum.

BU is not bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-05 11:16:40
There won't be a hard fork, not for the crap BU is pushing.
This BU bull is just another scam artist outfit with a large corporate advertising budget, Spreading disinformation and propaganda is all they can do. If they had any shred of integrity or an actual product, they would come out as a legitimate alt coin. They can't. 
We've seen all too much of this type of fly-by-night scam, on this and other legitimate cryptocurrency forums. (lookin' at you ClassicCoin &amp; Co.)  
Pay no attention to the hostile capitalist takeover attempts.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-02-22 18:46:37
Bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 07:36:27
The completely ludicrous scams like UnlimitedCoin, ClassicCoin &amp; Co would have been the death of bitcoin if their hostile takeover attempts had a chance of succeeding.  What such shady outfits want has nothing to do with hard fork, soft fork or anthing like it.
What they want is to completely hijack another already successful open source project.
This behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all open source, not just cryptocurrency.
Careful planning, like with SegWit, for Bitcoin's longevity and safety, are vitally important. 
The large and knowable Bitcoin dev team has been working on solutions for any scalability problems for a long time now, and produce realistic, healthy solutions.
No way in hell anyone serious is willing to turn bitcoin over to a tiny dev team of scam artists and their  corporate (or worse) backers.
@_date: 2016-03-17 16:10:56
What division?  There is no real division, no matter what the annoying propaganda artists keep saying.

@_date: 2016-03-24 09:31:42
The title of this post is editorialized bullshit. We've had way too much of this propaganda campaign. There is zero "control" issue, and "centralization" means mining power exclusively, contrary to the title's blatant FUD.
This thread is a destructive waste of resources. Blatant spam that deserves to be deleted.

It is only a good thing to block spam and nonsense. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 23:24:44
Seriously?  Look at all the corporate funding scam artists like UnlimitedCoin, ClassicCoin &amp; co raised.  
They cater to people / corporations that are also out to make a quick buck.
Huge mining firms, governments, corporations... You ask a silly question really.
Bitcoin has become a target, and not just for such as them.
There are powerful players that would love nothing more than to turn it into another easily controlled fiat, for their own profit, or destroy it outright. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 19:15:31
This is exactly what is going down. There really is no debate, just a huge amount of money from Classic Coin corporate backing.  This has been plaguing  bitcoin forums, as well as this sub, for months.
@_date: 2016-03-25 00:11:47
This is exactly what we are talking about with decentralization. It has to do with mining power and protecting against any one player getting a controlling interest.
To assert otherwise is either willfully spreading disinformation, or showing you don't know what you're talking about.

The mods here are tolerant the to the extreme. I'd delete every spam thread outright. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 15:14:54
I wonder what, exactly, they stand to gain.  This is extremely worrying. There are a lot of big businesses dead set against bitcoin because it is not controllable as they see fit.
With the extremely aggressive takeover attempts, and what amounts to straight up propaganda and shit-slinging by new "classic" altcoin fanatics, on in this sub, and elsewhere, ya really gotta wonder what the hell is *actually* going on.
It is very easy to imagine people wanting to twist bitcoin into something they can more easily control, and profit from, than in it's current form.
The entire thing is shady as fuck.  Go make yer own altcoin, that's fine. It needs its own blockchain and forum though. Leave bitcoin out of it.
@_date: 2017-02-22 18:45:55

@_date: 2017-02-26 14:59:45

They cannot, so they are attempting a hostile takeover of an already successful open source project.
This is extremely shady shit, and discouraged with extreme prejudice by the Open Source community.

This forum is tolerant of such spam, disinformation and propaganda, almost to a fault.

@_date: 2016-03-13 18:13:34
No there is no censorship of intelligent discussion here. In fact, a lot of downright bullshit is let slide.
Jezus, now you're even yelling "censorship!" without there actually even being any. I wish there was actually, then we wouldn't have to waste our time with stuff so completely irrelevant to bitcoin.
(well, it is relevant in that Classic Coin is cluttering up the bitcoin blockchain, when they should have their own)
No man, there simply are not good reasons put forward to argue with.
At least, very few and far between. I have had 2 conversations in the last 2 months with normal people about Classic Coin.  They were honest, but had some bad info. They did present their points intelligently though, and gave the information they had as backup, false as it was.
So many other conversations just immediately devolve into spreading obvious lies, disinformation, going way off topic, or ad hominem shit slinging. This is the vast majority, because there *is no* actual, good reason for Classic Coin, or any other altcoin, to exist on the bitcoin blockchain.
If it had its own, as any proper, self-respecting altcoin does, I'd be all for it. But then too, it would need its own subreddit also, as it really does now.
@_date: 2017-02-18 20:22:58

This is less than useless and does not belong on the bitcoin blockchain.
So many companies / institutions / organizations would love to turn bitcoin into something easily controllable for profit,  or destroy it because it resists just that.
Attempts to push such things onto the blockchain must be denied if all the great things bitcoin has over fiat are to survive.

Segwit is a step in the right direction.
The rest of the mumbo-jumbo you're preaching is not relevant to bitcoin. 
There is not other node software. Bitcoin belongs on Bitcoin's blockchain. All others using it are intrusive, abusive, and have no place here. 
Keeping the board free of such spam and harmful elements is good moderation. 
Edit:  If you buy coins that cannot be used by standard bitcoin clients, those coins are not bitcoin. 
Sorry for you that you got duped, but preaching otherwise here is only promoting more harm.
This forum is not for promotion of altcoins, especially not those that are destructive to bitcoin.
Intelligent discussion about respectable altcoins (on their own blockchain, with their own forums) is always welcome. This is not what you are doing.
@_date: 2016-03-17 16:08:13
Nobody fears anything. It *is* rather annoying to hear the same old tired off-topic crap every day though. 
Altcoins belong on their own subs, and blockchains for that matter.
Keeping spam off the sub is not censorship, it is good moderation.

Electronic money.  
Throwing away cryptocurrency's massive benefit of circumventing government-controlled financial institutions, 
in favor of (a shallow promise of) more easily using it to buy coffee,
would be a terrible trade-off.
Fortunately, SegWit will allow a way to make the latter easier, without threatening the former.

@_date: 2016-03-25 06:47:42
What isn't an altcoin?
Respectable altcoins use their own blockchain. Competition is good.
Using the bitcoin blockchain for incompatible currencies is a destructive practice that should be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
@_date: 2016-03-28 08:48:39
Does it produce currency that bona fide bitcoin clients can use?
No, so it is an altcoin. This is a very simple idea to understand.
It has nothing to do with bitcoin but trying to hijack the established bitcoin infrastructure (blockchain).
Respectable altcoins that fork from the bitcoin project need their own blockchain to be respectable.
The bitcoin community is not going to turn bitcoin over to a tiny handful of derisive, destructive devs. Especially not after seeing all the blatant propaganda, disinformation, astroturfing and downright shit-slinging their project produces.
Competition is good. If they did it right and their altcoin was actually better than bitcoin, people would use it. As it is, they simply cannot be trusted at all.
@_date: 2016-03-24 15:32:04
What the hell are you talking about dude? 
This silliness has gone on long enough.  An alternative implementation is something that is incompatible with bitcoin. 
This is what is being promoted with the completely false definition of "implementation diversity".  Total FUD. There is no such thing.
What you are talking about is not alternative whatsoever. Clients that use bona fide bitcoin currency are bitcoin clients. (unless they load a bunch of garbage data on top that real bitcoin is not designed for).
So, exactly what "implementation" are you promoting then?
And again, you are using the tern "centralization" completely wrong, even though we went through what the actual meaning of that term is. This shows a world of bias. 
There are plenty of conspiracies. Do you know what that term actually means?  Looks to me like you're working for one. The question everyone wants to know is which one?
And so many are promoting a ludicrous trust in some tiny team of non-bitcoin devs taking over all of bitcoin's established infrastructure. These are not to be taken seriously. There is no real chance of that happening, only destructive behavior. Sadly akin to this conversation.
Give it up man. Nobody is even reading down this far. You're wasting your employer's money.
Either that or you have actually bought into all the FUD and really believe what you are saying.  I was once like that.
There can be no trust in a team that invests tons of money in disinformation. Twisting the use of technical terms for political and profit driven gain, as is so, so often the case here lately, is nothing more than detrimental to bitcoin.
Those that promote projects using incompatible currencies, but using the bitcoin blockchain, are spamming. Period.
The only question is, which one of those projects are you promoting?
@_date: 2016-03-12 20:02:01

**De-centralization in the context of cryptocurrency has to do with mining power exclusively.**
Other projects using bitcoin's blockchain to produce incompatible currencies are a destructive waste of bitcoin resources.
OP's FUD title is also a waste of resources. Fully editorialized propaganda. As is /dangero's post above (if he realizes it or not). This is an attempt to hijack the bitcoin blockchain. Simple as that.
**There is no such thing as "implementation decentralization".**
We've had much too much of this blatant disinformation here (and so many other bitcoin forums) lately.
There is no "control" issue, except the control of our Bitcoins that the ones behind this post are trying to accomplish with their false advertising. This is very shady business and not to be trusted in the least.
Reality is, Bitcoin devs have detached the alert system from clients. 
This is fully in order, and they do have a good reasons. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 20:29:57
How to raise it without allowing huge money players to consolidate a dangerously large, controlling percentage of farming power, that is the real issue. 
Just willy-nilly raising blocksize to the sky, without careful consideration and protections in place, could be absolutely disastrous.
( And turning the entire blockchain over to a tiny ClassicCoin dev team to do it, absolutely ridiculous. )
Bitcoin devs are working on this. We're not up against the wall at all. Don't listen to all the DOOM! propaganda and politics. There are solutions to this concern, and time to implement them safely.

There is no debate.  There are actual cryptocurrency enthusiasts,

People are not going to turn bitcoin over to a tiny team of secretive devs. Only shady snake oil salesmen looking for quick profits support that nonsense.
No amount of advertising money, trying to drum up some fantasy "debate", will change that.
@_date: 2017-02-18 20:38:04
When we talk about nefarious outfits such as Classic, Unlimited, or the dozens of other scams we've seen being pushed, we're talking strictly about scams.
They have zero to do with the Bitcoin project, they are simply trying to hijack another open source project's resources.
Because, they have *no merit of their own*.  If they did, they would start a legitimate altcoin.  That is fully encouraged and what Open Source is all about.
The *source* is open, but the resources of a specific project (name, and in this case blockchian) belong to that project.
Trying to steal them is discouraged with extreme prejudice and only shows how untrustworthy the hijackers are.
Again, nobody is going to trust some tiny dev team that acts like this, especially when they dump so much funding into blatant propaganda and misinformation like the likes of "unlimitedCoin", or the scams that came before. 
Those "classicCoin" yahoos also crashed and burned, and for damn good reason.  
The only people supporting such hostile takeover attempts are the ones pouring money into the hostile takeover attempt.
@_date: 2016-03-24 02:52:06


Sorry dude, but this is a completely rediculous statement. How did you come to that conclusion from this?






In any case, the devs are working on this, so all the hoopla about a hard fork is completely silly. We have time to be careful, considering pros and cons, and do it right.
Also, if you are seriously interested, it's not hard at all to find information you need.
[Segregated witness still sounds complicated. Why not simply raise the maximum block size?](
@_date: 2016-03-24 16:25:16
This is exactly the kind of juvenile shaming attempt that we're all tired of here.

About your "cencorship"...
There was an insistence that an altcoin should not be able to flood in and take over another coin's sub. Especially with so much of said shit-slinging, disinformation and downright propaganda.
This is completely responsible in my eyes, but the mods gave it up because the abusers were screaming "Censorship!"
So now we get a ton of crap posted here, in the name of openness, about an altcoin (ClassicCoin) that is trying to hijack the Bitcoin blockchain and kill the parent project.
@_date: 2016-03-23 04:19:21
It has been quite apparent, not only on reddit, but on many bitcoin forums, that this type of destructive behaviour is taking place. 
Astroturfing, disinformation, downright trolling. Someone is spending a lot of money to sway opinions. 
Very glad for this confirmation. 
We only need to look at the shitstorm that is /btc to see the cause.

Is the currency it uses compatible with [bona fide bitcoin clients]( Can I send/receive actual bitcoins with it (as per bitcoin specs)?
If not, then no, it is not a bitcoin client. If it is trying to use the bitcoin blockchain in way it is not meant to be used, then it is only destructively, intrusively, cluttering up the bitcoin blockchain.
(Aggressively promoting such destructive behavior on bitcoin forums = spam)
Same goes for nodes or mining operations. If software is doing things on the bitcoin blockchain that are incompatible with bitcoin, then it is an altcoin that belongs on its *own blockchain* (altcoins are good).
If it is fully compatible, then there is no question really.  
This is very simple, so what is your question *really*?
@_date: 2016-03-13 11:54:46
Wut?  that is exactly the thing that would make it worse.
We need to have protections in place so that huge players don't take over the blockchain. Only then can larger blocksize safely be implemented. 
Zero fork required. Bitcoin is already working on this.

Or at least offer somewhat intelligent and interesting talking points. This has now devolved into the opposite.
These harmful tactics have become far too common, and all too obvious. :(
@_date: 2016-03-24 08:18:17


And a hard fork changing blocksize would make it at least as easy, if not easier. 


That "IF" is unrealistic in the extreme. Not sure why you'd even say something like that.
The *whole idea* is to avoid a hard fork, for many, many reasons. Backwards comparability is ensured with this soft fork roadmap. It would be optional, and also fully legitimate Bitcoin currency.
Also, there are many other optimizations being planned to use the blocksize we have to max advantage. 


No, you're not understanding. It is more efficient use of the blocks. Please stop cherry picking like this. 
I agree Segwit might not be the best option, but it avoids a lot of the problems a hard fork would.
In any case, any solution is best handled by the already large and knowledgeable Bitcoin dev team.
Or, do you have another suggestion? Just out of curiosity, what altcoin project's tiny dev team would you like to turn bitcoin development over to? Who are you promoting with all of this?
Please not one of the projects that have been so aggressive lately. We've been inundated with propaganda and disinformation these last months. Deep pockets paying to sway the less knowledgeable public to their own disadvantage (and large profit for the financiers).
IF someone has a better idea, it would be obvious by now. So far, nothing. And the aggressive hijacking maneuvers of some projects make it impossible to trust them in the least.
There really is no controversy. We all know a blockchain up, or optimizations might be needed in the future. Bitcoin devs are working on that, and many other things. 
I say again: Bitcoin is doing just fine.

The "ClassicCoin" activity clogging up the bitcoin blockchain cannot be counted one way or the other.
So yes, you are right, that sillyness is not a long term trend at all.
Nor does it have anything to do with Bitcoin, except a hostile takeover attempt by a handfull of drisive devs (with huge corporate advertising money to try to make it seem like a "thing").
Increasing the blocksize indiscriminately, with no attention to safety, could be disastrous.
These "classic coin" yahoos are busy spreading all kinds of disinformation like you responded to, and it seems like that is exactly what they want.
Thank goodness they never had a chance in hell with their silly takeover attempt.

There is no disagreement.  
There are bitcoin enthusiasts working to make it stable and long-lived,
and there are corporate interests that would love to make a quick buck (lookin' at you BU). 
An then there are interests tied to Fiat, that would love nothing more than to co-opt or destroy bitcoin.
The latter two are to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.

If you actually believe there was ever a chance of people seriously trusting the bitcoin blockchain to a handfull of derisive devs, handing over the entire project to them (for what reason? none) then dude, I'm sorry. You have been duped.
The only people still squacking about this sillyness are either the sock puppets being paid for by Classic Coin's corporate backing, or the victims they have fooled with their onslaught of propaganda and astroturfing.
There never was any chance of them taking over, there never will be. The aggressive and disruptive, downright abusive manner they've gone about things precludes any kind of trust or even slight respect for their "Project".
This is the truth.  I'm sorry they fooled you.

Aggressively promoting projects that are incompatible with bitcoin, yet insist on using its blockchain, is spam.

Divide what?  It is the blatant shilling, astroturfing, shit-slinging and propaganda that has been so disruptive lately.
There was never a chance in hell of ClassicCoin taking over. People are not going to hand over the blockchain to some tiny hand full of dissenting devs (no matter how much corporation propaganda money they pour into public forums). The majority never agreed that their hostile takeover attempt was a good idea. Far, far from it. Never a chance of it.
The large and knowledgeable Bitcoin dev team is working on any problems ClassicCoin seriously tried to adress, without any of the outrageous, completely unreasonable risk.
There is no censorship here. Simply an insistence that altcoins (as classiccoin by all rights is) have their own sub, and really, their own blockchain.
Now please, go sell your snake oil elsewhere. The place stinks of it lately.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2016-03-13 17:26:35
No reason to fool anybody. All it takes is looking at the actual situation. 
This is just one more example of the kind of disruptive nonsense I'm talking about. Zero content, just trying to derail.
It is extremely rare that I've seen any Classic Coin supporter bring up any halfway intelligent reason for it taking over the bitcoin blockchain and destroying the parent project.
You just get snide remarks like this joker.  It would almost be funny except for outright lies they often spew.
@_date: 2016-01-28 01:53:15
No, some small group of people want an altcoin, and are drumming up a lot of bullshit about bitcoin.
Instead of just starting up a project of their own, a fork, they want to to biggyback their ideas on top of the bitcoin blockchain. This is not acceptable.
Any further attempts to do so only make the situation worse.
Fork away, but leave bitcoin out of it. That is the only way.
@_date: 2016-03-14 15:41:20
What else is this ClassicCoin doing?  They want to take over the bitcoin blockchain and kill the parent project.
They are broadcasting their own incompatible currency on the bitcoin blockchain, so far as I understand it.  Something that every legitimate Bitcoin client filters out. But nodes still have to deal with this trash and pass it on.
So often I hear the silly idea of "decentralization" couched as "alternative clients"... which makes zero sense.  There are alternative *coins* aka currencies, and that is good, but alternative currencies (and their clients) on the same blockchain is completely ridiculous.
You've given me money for thought. I need to look into how the actual network works. My understanding is that ClassicCoin is using the bitcoin blockchain, and they do get passed along by nodes, even though no bitcoin client can use them. If that is not true, 
if Classic coin is not using the bitcoin blockchain, then it is truly just another altcoin, and all the hoopla they are driving is even more ridiculous. If it *is* using the bitcoin blockchain, then it is simply the hostile takover attempt it appears to be, and has no place anywhere in the cryptocurrency world.
Altcoins should have their own blockchain, own network, (and own forums for that matter).
And now I've gone WAyYY  off topic for this thread, but I appreciate your Gedankenanstoß a lot Mr. Evanston.
@_date: 2016-03-13 11:01:07
This makes absolutely no sense. 
Blocks are not like movies. They are like the pieces of movies being moved around, if anything. 
The only "movie" that should be on the bitcoin blockchain is Bitcoins.
If we increase the pieces so much that huge corporations have a major advantage, can send out fake pieces and corrupt most transfers... Bitcoin dies. 
This is a terrible analogy, and they way you put it forward does not have anything to do with crytocurrencies whatsoever. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 08:41:07

Tons of that on all kinds of bitcoin forums lately, since the hostile takeover attempt of "ClassicCoin" and all their corporate advertising money.

If they wanted people to have a choce they would have simply made an altcoin, as this new "clasic" by all rights is.
That they are trying to forcefully take over an established electronic currency's infrastructure is simply abusive.
In the end it detracts from both services. Make an altcoin and give people a real choice, not try to take over, or destroy a good thing.
In the end it very much looks like some small group wants to take advantage of a good thing, twisting it for their own profit, at the detriment to everyone else.

@_date: 2016-03-25 00:00:18
I am very well aware. I'm correcting the misuse of the term "decentralization" for people that are not up on the technical jargon.
It has to do with mining power being spread out. It has absolutely nothing to do with spamming incompatible currencies on the bitcoin blockchain. 
Some people are trying to make their shady practices sound like a good thing by twisting the word into something it simply is not.
Don't trust anyone doing this, they are spreading disinformation for their own profit.
@_date: 2016-03-24 23:44:53
The problem I'm talking about is when people start spouting "decentralization" when they really are talking about using incompatible currencies on the same blockchain.
There is no such thing as "implementation decentralization".  Those would be altcoins. See my meaning?
Decentralization is important so that no one player can gain a controlling %. It has nothing to do with different clients, mining or node types on the same blockchain. 
This is to be discouraged with exteme prejudice. It is destructive behavior, yet there are plenty of disinformation artist trying to make it sound like a good thing by using the term decentralization falsely.
@_date: 2016-01-19 09:10:03

There are so, so many organizations that would love to twist Bitcoin into something more controllable and profitable like fiat currency. The banking industry not among the least. Also other cryptocurrency projects funded by establishments looking to do the same.
There is a huge amount of trolling, propaganda and disinformation on bitcoin forums to confuse the less informed. The above comment is a perfect example.
The bitcoin blockchain is made for bitcoin. Cluttering it up with other project's data is hostile behavior. 
This goes for pretty much any cryptocurrency project. One currency, one blockchain. This is how bitcoin works.
Altcoin projects are good. If they are better, people will use them. Competition is a good thing.
Trying to hijack the infrastructure of another project is a detestable practice and is to be discouraged with extreme prejudice. This kind of behavior can neither be called an atlcoin, nor be be trusted in any way.
Promoting such (especially with clueless shaming attempts) is nothing but destructive spam, and is also to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.

How the bitcoin wallet connects has nothing to do with (de)centralization.  You're using that term wrong.
Of course Bitcoin clients use the bitcoin blockchain. What alternitive would you like? Do you realize what a rediculous idea it would be to invite every altcoin to use the bitcoin network?
That's not how cryptocurrency works, not bitcoin anyway, so please think about what you're actually saying there.
Decentralization is talking about mining power, nothing more, nothing less. How do you know?  Put out a bit of effort to learn is all. You would know what the term decentralization means if you had.

You're just proving the point that this onslaught of astroturfing and shit-slinging means there is no way to trust anything from the Classic Coin team.

Decentralization in the context of cryptocurrency refers to mining power.
It does NOT mean allowing any tom, dick and harry scam artist to call themselves bitcoin-this-or-that and spam up the Bitcoin blockchain.
The software is open for any to fork from, but the resources of the different altcoin projects belong solely to those projects.  This is key in any Open Source project, and abusive hijacking attempts are discouraged with extreme prejudice.
So no, there was no contradiction at all, just a misunderstanding you have about what decentralization actually means.
@_date: 2016-03-24 12:22:50
That has to do with bitcoin, but "decentralization" is a term with a completely different meaning in the context of cryptocurrency.  
**Centralization** is a large threat because when a major player, organization, group, has a **controlling percentage of mining power** they can do very, very bad things with it. This is the definition of that term in the cryptocurrency world. Period. 
Please do not fall for the propaganda and disinformation saying otherwise. It has absolutely zero to do with clients, various projects wanting to piggyback on established bitcoin blockchain, or anything else.
Clients and miners using non-compatible currencies over the bitcoin blockchain are not Bitcoin. They are destructive and to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
We cannot have every altcoin that feels like it piggybacking on another project's network willy-nilly. This is incredibly shady behavior and promotion of such is spam.
With all the spam floating around here lately, your confusion is not hard to understand. Now you know the truth, so please use the term correctly from now on.
@_date: 2016-01-18 01:23:33
The very obvious project going on here to influence popular opinion in favor of a practice that is to the detriment of bitcoin.

This is good for none but the few that are orchestrating the propaganda.
Bitcoin is for everyone, not for a select few's profit.
Want it to change? Do it right.  The crap being flung around here lately, pushing so hard, is completely untrustworthy.
Bitcoin is just fine as it is.  If not, things will change naturally, not by force.
@_date: 2016-03-25 00:09:19
In cryptocurrency, decentralization has a very specific, technical meaning.  It has to do with mining power and protecting against any one player getting a controlling percentage.
Some try to use the term to make their shady behavior (trying to hijack the bitcoin blockchain for their own project) look OK. 
"Implementation Decentralized" is an absurd idea. There is no such thing. Such blatant disinformation has no place in any serious discussion about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-25 06:55:17


Ok, we are on the same page then after all.
You see so, so much disinformation here lately trying to assert the false idea that decentralization also means different, incompatible currencies using the bitcoin blockchain. A completely false use of the term.
It is a destructive and annoying practice, aimed at confusing people for politics and profit. 
I apologize, I must have confused you with one of those disinformation artists. My bad.
There is no such thing as "decentralized implementation". That is my main point.  What you're saying about a decentralized network is OK, though I'd add the term is most useful when describing mining power.
Describing multiple, incompatible currencies on the bitcoin blockchain is completely a false usage, and now I see we agree on that. More power to ya Mr One.

There is no need for the "core" descriptor.  
There is the Bitcoin project, and there are altcoins,
and then there are scams like XT, Classic, and now BU.
The latter have nothing to do with Bitcoin, except for trying to hijack Bitcoin's resources.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:25:06
This crap has been going on for months and months.
A short recap of the main points though:
Open Source means the *source* is open. A specific project's resources (name, and in this case blockchain) belong to the project. Trying to hijack another projects name, reputation and resources is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just cryptocurrency.  
The tiny UnlimitedCoin dev team has horrible quality control in their code. They have demonstrated this abundantly, releasing poisonous blocks. This was a very big deal, never should have happened at all.
This tiny dev team is also very secretive, playing their cards close to the chest, which is inherently very bad in an Open Source project, let alone one handling people's money.
And then we have people like this Roger Ver yahoo, spewing all kinds of blatant lies, propaganda, and downright shit-slinging. Dude obviously has a severe lack of technical know-how. The one thing you can say about him is he's a damn good salesman. He has a ton of corporate money to spend on his misinformation campaigns.
Speaking of propaganda and shit slinging, you can also tell that this, and other legitimate cryptocurrency forums are constantly brigaded by corporate shills, working for such shady organizations.
They are very easy to spot nowadays. Any attempt at legitimate discussion quickly deteriorates into name calling, diversion, and abuse. There really is no argument they can offer to support the likes of XT, Classic, Unlimited, etc....
We've seen all this happen far too often before. It surely will again too, as long as Bitcoin remains popular. :/
Thankfully, such scams are much easier to spot nowadays. Keep an eye out for the things they have in common, a few of which I've listed here for ya.
Nobody in their right mind is going to hand over Bitcoin to such an underhanded, tiny dev team of get-rich-quick artists. The only people that support them are other scammers, such as the already too large mining conglomerates that support them.
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:22:13

Then again, ETC didn't try to act like it was actually bitcoin did it, so your point is irrelevant. 
Or wait, did it?  In that case you've strengthened mine.
And bitcoin keeps increasing value.   As well as some other well-run altcoins 
that actually have worthy dev teams and act responsibly.
Unlimited Coin, Classic Coin, and other blatant hijacking attempts are doomed to fail.
oop, one already has,  the other will too.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:27:55

If pushed and pushed without thought for safety of the network, any preparation or forethought, then yes.
The bitcoin devs are working on this. We're nowhere near against the wall. There is plenty of time for a rational plan.
Yet there are so many screaming "hard fork now!", pushing to turn the blockchain over to a tiny dev team of dissenters and killing the parent project.
Rational arguments that we can use larger blocksize is something completely different, and is talked about often here, and other worthy bitcoin forums. Intelligent discussion is welcome, and that is obvious.
Also very obvious is the other side... The disinformation and downright shit-slinging such "conversations" so often devolve into. That is blatant spam and needs to be controlled. 
This is not unlike your reactionary strawman comment.
I say again, there is no censorship here, only well deserved culling of destructive influences.

@_date: 2016-03-23 15:10:30


There is though. That is the main problem, and why we need to be so careful.
Larger blocksize, with no protections in place, will greatly benefit huge, wealthy mining farms, and be a detriment to smaller groups, or individuals. This will tip the scales even farther and tend to centralize mining power.
Having one huge player get a controlling percentage of mining power is an enormous threat. 
Even large mining pools will scale back or split up to maintain respectability. This is a very well known problem. It is why decentralization is to be encouraged. (meaning mining power decentralization. There is no such thing as client / implementation decentralization) 
I encourage everyone that does not understand why we can't run willy-nilly into larger blocksize, with no protections, to inform themselves about it.
@_date: 2016-03-24 09:38:05
Seriously, this blatant FUD has been so annoying these last months.
The title of this post is spam. Zero basis in reality.
That's not what decentralization means at all. It has to do with mining power exclusively, not implementation.

What is *not" is the resources of the Bitcoin project itself.
That is simply how open source works. 
Core *is* bitcoin. The bitcoin blockchain belongs to the bitcoin project.  
BU is using the bitcoin name, and spamming up the bitcoin blockchain, though they have nothing to do with bitcoin.
This type of shady behavior does not fly in open source.
@_date: 2016-01-18 00:08:20
I really wonder at this point what big profit motivation is behind this huge "up the blockchain"  message that is being spammed here.
Who stands to gain from it?  At this point it's pretty obvious it is not positive for bitcoin. It is obviously positive for *someone* though.
Whatever it is, it needs to stop.  IF things need to change, then not this way, not for the benefit of a select few.
@_date: 2017-02-12 20:33:10
If the get-rich-quick scammers running BU actually managed their hostile takeover attempt, there would be no more bitcoin.
Fortunately, there's not a snowball's chance in hell of that happening.
@_date: 2017-03-23 01:28:15
What an absolute load of crap. 
Simply increasing block size, with zero protections to the threat it would bring, would be lunacy. 
Was not going to happen, and the disreputable scam artists pushing for such are only out for their own quick (and temporary) profit. 
Segwit is the way forward.
@_date: 2016-03-12 19:51:38
Very little to do with the community, and a whole ton to do with advertising dollars. The sock puppet astroturf army is what sucks so bad lately. 
About time that ClassicCoin just gave up it's silly idea of forcing a hostile takeover with no real grounds. Then we can all get back to discussing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-23 17:22:38
The whole "Classic Coin" debacle is a perfect example.
So much FUD and propaganda around that. Seen so much disinformation by people promoting this silliness.
On occasion, someone has a serious thing to say, but those are few and far between.
Most "conversations" quickly devolve into shit-slinging. Pretty obvious the majority of people doing this are astroturfers. Paid shills looking to derail any intelligent conversation.
The whole thing is disgusting. It is a pest here, and on many other serious bitcoin forums.
In my opinion, such blatant examples of spam and destructive behavior should be deleted, but then they cry "censorship!" so mods let a ton of bullshit slide on by.
No, keeping spam and aggressive promotion of destructive behavior off the board is not censorship, it is good moderation.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:42:17
BU itself is a hostile takeover attempt. Their tiny, secretive, and obviously technologically disadvantaged dev team is desperately trying to steal another project's resources.
If they had any shred of talent or integrity, they'd offer legitimate competition with an altcoin.  They cannot.
They only thing they have going for them is a bunch of corporate advertising money, and other get-rich-quick scam artists (already too large mining outfits).
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:29:48
There never was a Hong Kong agreement. 
Also, there is zero reason to "compromise" with scam artist like Unlimited. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 10:45:12
Yes, but these "stratis" people seem to be shooting for people actually using their experiment as a production node. :/  Very, very iffy.  We've all seen way too many hijacking attempts from scams such as XT, ClassicClin, and lately UnlimitedCoin.
By all means, experiment and learn, but as you say, nobody is going to trust some tiny dev team to write an actual production bitcoin node, well, except disreputable miners promoting scams such as listed above.
@_date: 2016-03-13 15:41:43
There have been no real life reasons to get behind Classic Coin.  There are some "issues" it might try to address, but they are already being adressed by the bitcoin devs.
The vast, vast majority of what you hear from Classic Coin supporters is abuse, disinformation and blatant propaganda. No reason, no actual points to make.  It gets tiring. It is a huge waste of time and needs to stop.
It is also more and more clear to more and more people just how useless and downright annoying such silliness is. We've had to put up with it for months now, and not just on reddit.
If you, yourself, are not an astroturfer, then I'm really, really sorry for you, because you've been fooled. Please, don't repeat the blatant FUD and lies these people are pushing.
@_date: 2016-01-27 20:16:18
Wishing for a fork to also use its own blockchain, as altcoins do, is only right and would be the best for everyone concerned.
Also, though we do talk about altcoins here sometimes, it is not the place for one fulltime. This "classic" idea needs it's own project.
Trying to forcefully take over bitcoin harms everyone.
@_date: 2016-03-18 21:08:30
Multiple node implementations... on the *same* blockchain?
That's not how this works.  Each altcoin to its own blockchain.
This is part of the disinformation and downright silliness that needs to stop.
Respectable altcoins are a good thing. From litecoin to dodgecoin. Shall we invite them all to use the bitcoin blockchain?  No.
On blocksize... increasing it willy-nilly just encourages huge mining farms that could gain a controlling percentage. This is a very large threat and there needs to be protections in place before any serious implementation can be put in place. 
Throwing caution to the wind because of trumped up "controversy" would be deadly to Bitcoin. Scream DOOM! all you want, we've got time to do things right.
There is a very large and very well educated dev team working on all the points you're trying to make. I say again, there is zero reason to panic and turn over the blockchain to some tiny minority of devs, no matter how much money they have for advertising. 
There never was a chance of any hostile takeover happening, and people trying to make it a thing, especially with such ludicrous ideas as "client diversity" is completely counter-productive.
There is no real controversy. There are topics of concern, and they are being addressed very well without all the DOOM! reactions.
Diversity of mining power is the key point of major concern. This has priority, and the devs are working on it very well.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:37:28
Upping block size indiscriminately would cause vastly greater problems than it would "fix". 
Segwit is the safe and sane solution.  Simply upping block size is no solution at all.

The entire BU propaganda, disinformation and downright shit-slinging is FUD.  Paid for by corporate backers.
We've seen this shady behavior before so many times (ClassicCoin being another well-known example).
UnlimitedCoin was destined for failure from the start The only people supporting it are other get-rich-quick scam artists, and the poor people that have been duped.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:23:18


You mean the corporate sponsored propaganda mill /btc.
Yah, we've had quite enough of the scams promoted there (XT, Classic, now UnlimitedCoin) 
and are really tired of the paid shills that Roger Ver uses for brigading legitimate cryptocurrency forums with disinformation and downright shit-slinging.
That's all this latest scam of his has going for it. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:23:39
This "message" is complete and total disinformation and propaganda.
There  is no truth to it whatsoever.
You'd be in favor of increasing max block size willy-nilly, with zero protections in place for the even further mining power centralization that would promote.
This is insanity, as anyone that knows the first thing about cryptocurrency, especially bitcoin, is well aware of.
Ain't gonna happen, and there was never a chance of it.
Contrary to such blatant nonsense, SegWit is the way forward, and bitcoin is doing just fine. There is no legitimate "controversy", except maybe what to do about the already destructive centralization of mining power we already have.
Encouraging more of it is madness. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:20:05
This is for Litecoin.  It has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:26:56
It means the vast majority are very much centralized and under control of a tiny minority of people.
Just makes it even more clear what a corporate scam BU really is.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:38:43
heh, they won't have anyting to exchange if no nodes pass along incompatible spam, nor wallets use it.
Their cut of the transactions would quickly become a dustbowl, like the shady miners that insist on supporting such an attack.

Technically incompetent too, and pretty blatantly so.

Giving miners power to blackmail Bitcoin like that is the opposite of a solution. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:13:37
No, the term has nothing to do with software development. 
It has to do with decentralization of mining, and yes even node power.
Software development of bitcoin is concentrated fully on the Bticoin Project itself. There is no other.
Just as altcoin development is concentrated on those open source projects.
Where we run into problems is sleasy get-rich-quick scams trying to steal the name of another project, then blathering some ridiculous bullshit about development "decentralization" to excuse their hijacking attempt.
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:27:20


False. We fully expect and condone reputable behavior.  Anything but is discouraged with extreme prejudice.
Legitimate mining outfits have, when approaching that deadly 51%, done the right thing, splitting off into smaller groups and encouraging their members to do the *moral* thing.
These completely shady mining institutions that are looking to attack now, have none of such going for them.  Neither do the tool they are currently using: this latest scam UnlimitedCoin.
Yes, we need to protect ourselves from such, but no, it is very much expected that miners and all open source projects, act exactly the opposite.
Cryptocurrency does need to be hardened against such shady get-rich-quick scams.  It sounds way too much like you're trying to apologize for such behavior "because they can".
Again, only other shady get-rich-quick scam artists have such an attitude  (large banks and corporate driven governments included).
@_date: 2016-03-24 23:50:15
No, this is not what the term means in the context of cryptocurrency. When we talk about decentralization, we are talking about mining power, and protecting from one player gaining a controlling percentage of it.
 What you are talking about is something completely differnt. Please do not try to confuse the two.
There is lots of spam and disinformation like this going around. Improperly using the term "decentralization" to make it seem OK for more than one currency type to use the bitcoin blockchain.
This is destructive behavior and should be discouraged with extreme prejudice. Ironically, the people pushing this FUD most are on reletively tiny dev teams that would love to take over the entire bitcoin blockchain and kill the parent project.
This is, of course, a ridiculous idea, but still we hear again and again their propaganda about "implementation decentralization". There is, in fact, no such thing.  They are describing a rouge project's hijacking attempt. 
Again, this has nothing to do with what the team actually means in cryptocurrency jargon.
@_date: 2016-03-12 19:59:20
haha... what the hell are you talking about?
Get outa here with your sillyness. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 08:34:15
This "Classic" altcoin should, by all rights, already be fully active. It is, in fact, a completely independent project, and it needs its own blockchain. So, and only so, will the better currency be shown by majority.
As it is, they are so aggressively, desperately trying to kill the parent project, piggybacking on bitcoin's already established infrastructure, it is impossible to respect or trust them.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:15:59
It is the only attitude to have.
This yahoo wants complete monopoly control of bitcoin.
There is zero reason to negotiate with such destructive actors.
Quite the contrary.  They will adapt to what is good for bitcoin, or be removed.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:30:43
Unlimited is not Bitcoin.
They are spamming the bitcoin blockchain with useless crap.
"diversity" in the bitcoin blockchain is completely idiotic.   Where are you getting such ideas?  Please stop listening to the cesspools of disinformation such as /btc &amp; Co.
There is one Bitcoin project.  The code they use is open to fork from, as in any open source project.
The project's name and resources are NOT free to use.
In this case of Bitcoin, it means their blockchain.
Such shady behavior scams such as XT, Classic, and now Unlimited partake in are discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source.
These have zero to do with bitcoin whatsoever. 
They are a cancer on the face of open source in general, cryptocurrency and are (laughably) trying to hijack bitcoin.
We've seen this crap all too many times.  the tiny Unlimited "dev team" could not make a decent altcoin if they wanted to. Even if they tried, they would deserve some respect for trying.  
What Unlimited, and their shady corporate backers, and disreputable miners backing them, are doing now, is completely destructive.  
Again, they have zero to do with actual bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:57:58
There is zero comparison between legitimate cryptocurrency forums such as this one,
and corporate funded propaganda mills such as /btc.
Anyone paying attention knows full well that /btc promotes scams such as XT, Classic, and now UnlimitedCoin.
This yahoo /super-bad, *with a day-old account*, spouting some off-topic gibberish, about the Illuminati or whatever, *claiming* to be pro-bitcoin, is just trying to derail actual conversation, providing an easy strawman.
This is typical behavior of paid shills under Roger Ver's employ.
@_date: 2016-03-17 19:26:15
Forum censorship is a complete non-issue. It does not happen.
They might delete spam and nonsensical disinformation. Not the same.
We are here to discuss Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency, not be inundated by altcoins, let alone hostile takeover attempts. Crying "censorship!" *is* the strife.
Altcoin promotion belongs in its own sub, not trying to take over this one.
Bitcoin development is worthy of discussion, of course, and is fully welcome here.
There is much too much talk about "division" that simply does not exist. 
The question itself was silly, as was OP's answer.
@_date: 2016-01-28 16:00:38
Defame?  They *are*, by all rights, altcoins.
Attempting a hostile take over of an existing infrastructure like bitcoin's for their own altcoin project, they have defamed themselves, through no fault but their own.
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:39:40
There is absolutely zero reason to "compromise" with scams like UnlimitedCoin, nor disreputable mining organizations.
Nobody that knows the first thing about cryptocurrency is backing such destructive hijacking attempts, except other get-rich-quick scam artists.

No such thing. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 15:08:38
I wonder why people are so very gung-ho to wrest control away from the active and stable dev team.
It very much sounds like someone wants to twist bitcoin in a direction that will be more profitable to them. There are people that would love to destroy any bit of the anonymous nature of it, for instance.
I don't trust anything about this "classic-coin" business, not the least reason being how gung-ho agressive, even propaganda like the idea has been shoved down our throats. 
This is not a good thing for any of us, but probably will be for a select few that are behind it.
The bitcoin devs can feel and act as they wish, I have my own very strong reservations. This altcoin belongs on its own blockchain, and it its own sub.  
@_date: 2016-01-28 15:10:48
Anyone is free to create an altcoin.  The problem with this "classic-coin" is they are trying to destroy bitcoin, completely co-opting the already established infrastructure. This is not OK in any way.
Go off and make as many altcoins as you want, but aggressively taking over an already established project is simply shady as fuck. It should not be allowed to happen.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:08:58
"Decentralization" means mining power in this context.
Hostile takeover attempts do not = decentralization.
*legitimate* altcoins are a good thing, but that is not the topic at hand.
If scams like BU would offer a bona fide altcoin instead of the shit they're trying to pull, there would be zero problem.
They cannot.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:00:19
Supporting UnlimitedScam is nothing to be proud of.
This is one more horrible coding flaw in a long line, and more will come.
Nobody in their right mind is going to turn Bitcoin development over to a miniscule group of incompetent, corporate-backed  scam artists.
@_date: 2016-03-28 17:32:22
The title of this post simply does not jive with what you claim.
"Give up power" over what then? More importantly in favor of what?
There is no truth to either, as it has nothing to do with the occurrence you're reporting.
And people can easily read the rest of this thread you know. Your stance elsewhere doesn't jive with your last message here either.
In any case, this thread is old news, thank goodness.
Quite possibly some less knowledgeable folk have been misinformed by it as to what decentralization refers to. That is sad.
Then again, maybe some have learned the truth from it.
@_date: 2017-02-10 23:57:08
There is no reason to throw out the baby with the bathwater.
SegWit is nothing but a good thing. The only ones not on board are big-blocker get-rich-quick corporate backed scams. (lookin' at you BU &amp; Co.)
There is no real debate, just a ton of advertising money 
spent spreading disinformation to make it look like there is.
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:37:41
So, 2 devs went off to create yet another destructive hijacking attempt.
See, instead of doing anything respectable, like start an *actual* altocoin,
they did what is aggressively discouraged in any open source community,
tried (and are trying) to hijack the resources of the parent project.
These yahoos have abundantly demonstrated that they are severely lacking in tech know-how (this latest is by no means the only example) and have shown they have zero respect for open source, or cryptocurrency.
Supporting such get-rich-quick scam artists shows a person either:
1.  needs to learn more about how open source, and specifically cryptocurrency, actually works.
2. already are aware of point one and still support these scam artists and their shady corporate backers.
Actual Open Source and Cryptocurrency advocates strongly suggest you inform yourself more before repeating blatant propaganda, 
or get back to cesspools of disinformation like /btc where such is promoted. :(
Such spam is not welcome in any legitimate cryptocurrency forum.
@_date: 2016-03-17 16:23:51
Keeping spam away, figting astroturfing and disinformation is *not* censorship.

The mods here allow discussion though, as this thread still being here proves.

Not to mention that the BU dev team is TINY, and have show again and again to be severely lacking in technical merit.
Even if they offered an actually legitimate altcoin instead of this shady hijacking attempt, they the BU project would be completely unworthy. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 20:19:36
The only thing that is "tearing apart" the community is an aggressive takeover attempt by another altcoin competitor.
The entire "classic" thing needs its own sub, as it needs its own blockchain. Trying to take over an already established infrastructure might be easier (and most likely profitable in some way), but as you say, it is bad for bad for the majority.
@_date: 2016-03-13 10:55:36
Exactly, that is the whole problem.
Raising the block size will tip the scales even farther to huge money projects like these farming outfits.
There needs to be assurances that no one farming pool can take over the blockchain. Some have scaled back to maintain balance, but a hostile attacker would have no qualms.
Increasing the blocksize indiscriminately, with no protections in mind, could be disastrous.
@_date: 2016-03-13 08:16:34
Case in point.
@_date: 2017-03-22 06:55:11
It is another sign of their centralized model. Something completely against what cryptocurrency in general, and specifically bitcoin, is all  about.
Also, as if they weren't shitting all over Open Source best practices in the first place, playing favorites with closed sources really is that last yard of rope for this BU scam.

@_date: 2016-03-23 14:13:57
Yes, pointing out and discouraging such destructive behavior is a topic of interest.
Aggressively promoting it though is nothing but spam, to put it mildly, and has no place here.
Nothing subtle about it. The shitstorm of disinformation, blatant propaganda and downright abuse going on the last months here has gotten way out of hand. For example, the whole "Classic Coin" crap, among others.
Altcoins are good, but to be a respectable altcoin they need their *own blockchain*, and forums for that matter.
@_date: 2016-03-18 21:56:59
Majority what?  Authentic, bona fide Bitcoins are by far the majority of traffic on the bitcoin blockchain, as it should be.
Others are just cluttering it up. This is destructive behavior. The bitcoin blockchain is designed for one currency. To argue otherwise is absurd. 
This conversation has now devolved into uselessness, like so many others I'm talking about.
This forum is about bitcoin, not some fantasy implementation. This is destructive and has no place in any serious discussion here. This is in no way controversy, it is a waste of time. This is what people are so tired of. Blatant disinformation attempts.
Good on ya if you want to support an altcoin, or group of them, that use *their own* blockchain like that, just please, don't try to call it bitcoin, or spam bitcoin forums with it. 
Alcoins need their own blockchain, and forums for that matter.

If he "said it was a mistake" that little tidbit *conveniently* got zero press coverage, 
in stark contrast to his downright lies before hand.
Seriously, you think anyone is going to trust this yahoo?  Or you either, with this diatribe of bullshit trying to stick up for him? 
This UnlimitedScam, and Classic before it, and pretty much everything the man touches, is poison.
You know it full well, but you're still desperately trying to "correct the record" for some reason (claiming it has nothing to do with profit no less!).
Give us a break.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:36:29
Nobody here is banned for anything but blatant, abusive over-the-top shit-slinging.
The mods here are very tolerant of UnlimitedCoin spam, almost to a fault.
Trying to assert otherwise is ridiculous, and will only get you tagged 
by legitimate cryptocurrency advocates 
as a shill or useful idiot, for damn good reason.
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:25:46
there is no entire group of "people", just a bunch of advertising money spent on propaganda and disinformation.
An unfortunate few crypto newbs do fall for it, for a bit,  but anyone serious realizes what's going on pretty quick.
/btc and other corporate driven propaganda centers are not only annoying, they are downright abusive.
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:27:01
You mean what a small handful of blowhards want. With all the energy being put into it, you really have to wonder about the motivation behind it.
Bitcoin is fine just the way it is.  If it needs improvement, then not through a hostile takeover.
There are plenty of altcoins,  why don't they just go make their own?
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:07:12
A "valid purpose" is not get-rich-quick schemes and scams.
Longevity and usefulness of cryptocurrency is VASTLY more important than temporary profit.
There is zero "good" about such shady dealings, even less about an open source project agressivly attempting to hijack the resources of its parent project.
This depiclable behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of open source (and any closed source for that matter!), not just cryptocurrency.
It is incredibly reckless and irresponsible to support such scams, and the destructive financial backers trying to destroy Bitcoin for temporary profit. :(
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:24:52
How can too much power be concentrated in Bitcoin?
Core *is* bitcoin.
We're talking about mining power here, not software.
@_date: 2017-02-11 02:37:29
Decentralization has to do with mining power, not clients. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 17:42:44
The entire blockchain is stolen
Can these "operators" produce actual bitcoins?  Are the two currencies on the bitcoin blockchain compatible?  
Therefore, the only option is for those operators to support an altcoin with its own blockchain.
OR use bitcoin.
What is fully not OK is for some yahoos to storm in making incompatable clients to disrupt bitcoin operations.
This is so obvious it really is a non-issue..
@_date: 2017-03-11 10:26:32


and thank goodness for that.  Let it just stay that way.
NOT being under control of fat-cat bankers, like our joke of a fiat system is,
is one of the main benefits of cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:13:43


To achieve this, there is currently no other working, tested, or even reasonable plan besides SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:47:22
Coins held in your own private wallet are safe (assuming security best practices).
It is ill-advised to hold large amounts of Bitcoin in any exchange for very long.
IF this BU scam actually starts spamming their useless garbage onto the Bitcoin blockchain,
simply run a full node, ignoring their incompatible blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:32:00
IF.  hehe.. and IF BU actually went ahead with their attack,
it would only harden Bitcoin against future hostile hijacking attempts.
Highly doubt it'll ever happen. Their corporate funding would disappear overnight.
They have much more to gain spending a good deal of it on spamming legitimate cryptocurrency forums (like this one) with their propaganda and disinformation.
They've shown again and again, that advertising budget is all they actually have going for them.  There is no legitimate technical merit in their miniscule dev team. 
Like XT, Classic, and so many others get-rich-quick scams before them.
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:31:07


Bitcoin will always be bigger than the scam that is UltimateCoin.
Investing in BU is pure folly. They have suckered in large sums of corporate investments,
as the hostile takeover attempts before them have (lookin' at you ClassicCoin).
They have all failed, and will continue to.
@_date: 2016-01-19 09:07:24
The only real solution here is to simply make another altcoin. If it is so much better, people will use it. 
Trying to ruin bitcoin is not any kind of answer, but it is what the ridiculous idea of a hard fork would accomplish. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:21:47
Bu is nothing if not evil.
They have zero going for them except a large advertising budget to pay for propaganda, disinformation and downright shit-slinging.
The disreputable mining outfits backing them are no better.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:25:57
And "getting the job done" very much includes the security and longevity of bitcoin.

No, you simply are presenting zero rational "argument" in the first place.
We've been through this time and again.  Please learn some more before bringing up such ridiculous assertions.
If you insist on spewing such garbage, be prepared to be called out on it.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:29:47
no, nothing you said in your first paragraph is true at all.
UnlimitedCoin is completely incompatible with bona fide bitcoin,
they are not even a legitimate altcoin.  (they would never survive by offering actual competition).
They have zero claim to the name Bitcoin, and spamming their parent project's blockchain with their crappy code is inexcusable.
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:42:35
Bitcoin.com is a huge scam, and this is well known in the cryptocurrency community.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:40:08
IF that ever happened,  (doubtful), then BU would cease to exist overnight, as everyone sold off the few pennies UnlimitedScam coins are actually worth.
Really though, who the hell would even buy BU?  It was destined for failure from the start, as so many other get-rich-quick scams before it.  
How much are ClassicCoin units worth these days?  heh
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:41:45
Nobody "communicates" with spam and malware before binning it.
The mods here are actually incredibly tolerant. Me, I'd kill this thread. 
This scam artist Wu is not worth giving a platform to.
Such as he are not interested in "conversation" just their aggressive takeover attempts. 
Yet here we are, and still such scam artists love to scream "censorship" when there obviously is none.
Such antagonistic propaganda just makes such obvious antagonists all that easier to spot for *actual* cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Among other destructive propaganda, like this joker Wu's article is full of.
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:11:22
which makes their entire get-rich-quick scam pointless in the first place.
Any BU attack is pre-programmed to fail from the start. 
As shady as those yahoos are though, they'd try to pull a fast one and change up something to keep their scam alive for as long as possible.
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:18:16
Yes, UnlimitedCoin has zero to do with bitcoin.
It is an altcoin, except with none of the honesty, integrity or actual functionality.
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:05:19
Is it just one spammer copying this exact text everywhere, 
or are they all just reading from the same script?
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:29:53
because it is a lie trying to hide behind nonsense.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:22:11
Decentralization in the context of cryptocurrency refers to mining power, not software implementation.
There is the Bitcoin project, other legitimate altcoins, 
and then a row of scams trying to hijack Bitcoin's resources.  
(XT, Classic, Unlimited, etc...)   
Such shady behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of open source, not just cryptocurrency. 
Whenever someone spews this nonsense about Bitcoin *software* being "decentralized" you for sure can find some scam or other (as mentioned above) behind it. :(
The code itself is open for anyone to use. The Bitcoin name and blockchain are resources of the Bitcoin project.
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:45:04
Like asking to "compromise" with spam before throwing it in the bin.
Ver and his scam outfit Unlimited are not interested in any such thing,
nor are the disreputable mining conglomerates threatening to attack Bitcoin.
There is zero reason to negotiate with such destructive agents.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:38:31
It is a very good and accurate analogy.
Hijacking a plane would work even better.  
There is reason to care about the "opinion" of the hijackers.
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:49:59
95% of the garbage comes from the corporate-sponsored cesspool of disinformation that is /btc.
There is absolutely no comparison to serious cryptocurrency forums like this sub.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:30:17
There are no "debates" on hard fork really,  nor willy-nilly increasing max block size with zero protections.
There are just the same ridiculous propaganda and disinformation spewed here, and debunked here, again and again. Propaganda campaigns paid for by corporate investors of scams like ClassicCoin, UnlimitedCoin and Co. 
The entire fantasy of "debate" on these topics is ridiculous. As is the fake and hyped up "consensus", "split community" bullshit.  There never was any, and this Hard Fork stuff is just more of the same.
Actual, serious debate over safe methods of dealing with expansion and growth have been had.  SegWit is the sane and reasonable answer.
Turning over Bitcoin to some tiny, secretive dev team with a severe lack of technological merit (not to mention a shred of integrity) is no answer at all.
@_date: 2017-03-23 10:33:57
Zero need for the "core" descriptor. 
Bitcoin is used through bona fide Bitcoin clients.
It use to be standard to run a full node along with them, which dropped off a lot after "thin-wallets" became popular.
Still, a lot more people are starting to run full nodes again now, as protection against such shady hijacking attempts such as XT, Classic, and lately UnlimitedCoin.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:33:12
people running BU are encouraging an agressive hijacking attempt.
Their attitude is exactly the *opposite* of "caring about the network or its future".
Quite the opposite, they support just another get-rich-quick scam.
We've seen this too many times before. XT, Classic, BU... they all crash and burn, and there will be more.
Fortunately, they're getting easier and easier to spot.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:21:08
Destroying bitcoin is toxic. That is what BU and the disreputable mining concerns pushing this bull are trying to do.
Back to /btc with the lot of you.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:50:21
yup, and would continue to.
That's the reason these BU yahoos don't start a legitimate altcoin.
They know damn well they have nothing but advertising money going for them.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:35:18
No, there are actually very good technical reasons for not willy-nilly increasing max block size.
Only get-rich-quick scam artists want such a ludicrous idea.
@_date: 2017-03-24 22:42:33
There is no civil war. That would require civilizations fighting on each side.
Fact is, there is only one community fighting against the corporate-backed abuse of scam artists.
The vast, vast majority of cryptocurrency experts and legitimate advocates know exactly what's up:
There is a hostile hijacking attempt, and a huge amount of lies, slander and propaganda coming from UnlimitedCoin, paid for by their corporate backers.
The only ones supporting these talentless yahoos are other get-rich-quick scam artists, like disreputable mining conglomerates,  and the army of shills under Roger Ver's pay.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:56:38
Irrelevant.  Nobody worries about insulting spam as they throw it in the bin either.
I do feel sorry for honest people that have been duped, but all they need to do is learn the first thing about cryptocurrency to protect themselves against such scam artists.
The vast majority of the propaganda and disinformation we see here, and other legitimate cryptocurrency forums, comes from cesspools like /btc, that are run by just such get-rich-quick artists (and, sadly, a small minority of naive people they fool for a time).
As people actually learn about how cryptocurrency and Open Source work, they quickly flee such corporate-backed propaganda mills. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:47:06
Geeze dude, just look at the mess Fiat is in.

This is not mud slinging. It is simply reporting facts. 
UnlimitedCoin does a fine job of discrediting themselves. 
They are the ones who resort to mud slinging, as anyone can clearly see. 
Calling out such scams is only good for the Bitcoin community, of which Unlimited is no part. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:03:09
"Cooperation" with scam artists like BU, or destructive mining outfits trying to hijack bitcoin, 
is not on the table, and for damn good reason.
SegWit has a 2mb+ block size increase included, with protection against the danger a simple increase would create.
Trying to block that, and ridiculously insisting on a naked block size increase with zero protections,
is only done by corporate backed scam artists (as above), and the few actual newbies that are taken in. :(
No, there will be no HF simply to increase block size. There never was going to be, also for damn good reason.
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:33:04
Sorry bud, obviously you're on the /btc "side" and in the minority.
The /btc bullshit brigade is so damn obvious in this thread it's not even funny.  People here DO know what's up.
Still it is allowed by the mods here btw...
next week we'll still hear bogus screams of "cencorship!" from the brigaders. 
And bullshit about instantly increasing max block size with no protections... and how miners need to be in control of bitcoin's direction... and other ridiculous crap.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:30:31
SegWit is not alienating anyone.
BU on the other hand is directly trying to hijack bitcoin, and spending tons of money on blatant propaganda. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:07:54
There is zero reason for the descriptor "core".
There is Bitcoin, and there are other legitimate altcoins.
Then there are get-rich-quick scams like XT, Classic and now UnlimitedCoin, trying to hijack Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-23 08:27:49
Decentralization in the context of cryptocurrency referrs to mining power. It has zero to do with software. 
To see someone in business making money off Bitcoin, that has so little idea about the tech itself is, very sad. 
This remark, so often repeated as blatant disinformation by scams like BU, shows that shapeshift cannot be taken seriously. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:36:09
Climate change denial in this context is akin to denying that scams like BU are destructive.
The vast majority of experts and serious cryptocurrency advocates assert this. 
Supporting UnlimitedCoin = Anti-vaccine level ignorance (or downright destructiveness).
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:45:46
Actually, the bona fide Bitcoin project is simply named bitcoin.
The others are merely hostile takeover attempts.
Altcoins are a GOOD thing, offering legitimate competition.
XT, Classic, and now Unlimited have zero claim to the Bitcoin name, blockchain,
nor any claim to legitimacy that serious altcoins have.
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:18:51
Actually, quite accurate.  The shit code they push, plus the blatant lies they tell about the complete ineptitude it consists of is enough.
For anyone that has been paying attention, this simple link is enough.
Add to that the downright shit-slinging Ver does, going so far as to pay shills to spread disinformation and propaganda on legitimate cryptocurrency forums such as this one. :-(
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:50:29
This sub is incredibly tolerant. If you actually did have a post removed (doubtful) it had to be for something blatantly against the rules, or very abusive. 
The reality is, you have to go WAY over the line to get anything deleted here. Those that do very much deserve it.
Protip: stop spamming serious cryptocurrency forums with blatant propaganda, disinformation, or downright shit-slinging (like /btc is so well known for) if you want to be taken seriously.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:43:05
Right.  Best sell the useless UnlimitedCoin for as much as any sucker will pay. 
It will very quickly be less than pennies on the unit.
There would be no need to withdraw bona fide Bitcoins. 
They'll continue on as always, as they have through so many other hijacking attempts.
@_date: 2016-03-23 14:39:50
The problem is using the blockchain for things it was not designed for. This is a huge waste of resources and very destructive.
There is a Bitcoin dev team, and anyone doing the above is no part of Bitcoin, they are trying to steal its resources for their own project.
Respectable behavior would be to join the bitcoin dev team, or start an actual bona fide altcoin with its *own blockchain*.
Hijacking another project's resources is destructive and to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
@_date: 2016-03-13 15:12:53
Nobody in their right mind ever considered turning over the bitcoin blockchain to some tiny handful of devs.
The idea is absolutely absurd. It was never going to happen. There was never a loss of "consensus" to begin with.
The only people still squawking about such silliness are the sock puppets paid for by Classic Coin's corporate backing, and the victims that they have fooled with their aggressive propaganda campaign. 
I am sorry if you have been fooled. Please stop repeating their disinformation.
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:20:15
BU is a huge mess of lies and disinformation, with zero technical merit.
Damn right, nobody in their right mind would hand the Bitcoin Project over to this tiny band of incompetent liars.
Even if the scam artist Roger Ver wasn't backing the scam.
The UnlimitedCoin project's goal is to turn bitcoin into another easily controlled, profitable fiat. Unscrupulous mining conglomerates would love the same thing.  
If these destructive players had their way, there would quickly be NO bitcoin  at all.
They have nothing to do with the Bitcoin Project, and never have.  (except trying to hijack it)
There is zero comparison.
@_date: 2016-03-24 12:43:11
Overuse of the term decentralization is not a problem...
Completely FALSE use of such tech jargon is. Sorry, your title is a shining example of such.
and please "give up power"... you expect anyone to believe you didn't know exactly what you were implying?
What project do you promote to hijack the bitcoin blockchain?


And there you go again.  Please inform yourself what that word actually means in terms of cryptocurrency. Stop using it falsely to for profit and politics as you are (knowingly or not).
Continuing to do so is nothing more than spam (to be very nice about it).
I'm going to have to downvote your post as being irrelevant to the subject you are commenting on.
In fact, the entire thread is worse than useless.  It is very difficult to believe, after such obviously biased language, that you were are not aware of this when authoring the title.
Reality:  Decentralization is important for *mining power* so that no one organization can gain a controlling percentage. If that happened it would be a HUGE threat to any cryptocurrency (in this case bitcoin). That is all (de)centralization means in this context. Period.
Centralization has *zero* to do with implementation. All implementations using the bitcoin blockchain to produce or use incompatible currencies are a huge waste of resources and extremely destructive to bitcoin.  
There are lots of organizations that would love to twist bitcoin into something more easily controllable (profitable) like fiat currency. Such blatant disinformation and misuse of technical jargon is destructively playing right into their hands.
Promoting such is spam and is to be discouraged with extreme prejudice. We have had way too much of this here, and other bitcoin forums of late.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:48:22
We're talking about Open Source projects here bud.
The resources of a project (including name) belong to that project.
This is just the same with companies. 
Open source means the source code is open to use, not the parent project's name, or in this case blockchain.
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:30:53
There is no reason to worry about the feelings of scam artists.
You also don't worry about the "arguments" of spam as you're throwing it in the bin.
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:47:57
Yes, eventually anyone with money to back his scams will know his reputation and tell him to take a walk.
Unfortunately, as long as Bitcoin is doing so well, others will replace him. :(  We've seen such attacks all too often. There will be more.
On the other hand, fortunately,  such get-rich-quick artists and their destructive scams are becoming much easier to spot. Every attempt just strengthens the bitcoin community to such social  attacks, and *legitimate* corporations are become less naive.
It is encouraging to see the joint decision from the majority of major bitcoin exchanges stating plainly that such hostile takeovers will not be acknowledged without bulletproof protection from double-spending. (aka, real proof of consensus).
They've seen too many scams come through too. :)
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:19:01
What, exactly, is your view for Bitcoin?
All we've seen so far is, "turn it over to a minuscule, secretive, inept dev team, that caters exclusively to miners and corporate interests." That is exactly what UnlimitedCoin is, as they've shown to no end.
If they actually had the technological know-how to offer a serious altcoin, and it proved worthy, hell, I'd use it to.
They do not, so they have not. They are running an aggressive hijacking scam instead.
What we want is an end to the spamming of propaganda and disinformation supporting such destructive "projects".  They are against everything Open Source stands for, not just cryptocurrency. They have zero to do with the Bitcoin project, except their hostile takeover attempt on it.
If you see the attack BU is trying to stage as being beneficial for Open Source, Cryptocurrency, or Bitcoin, please explain how.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:31:25
There is zero reason to "compromise" with spam.
SegWit is the only reasonable way forward.
Noting else today even comes close.
@_date: 2016-01-28 16:45:59
There is nothing wrong with an altcoin. 
Trying to destroy the original project you're forking from though, attempting to steal its network for your own altcoin, is extremely hostile, to say the least.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:33:29

People here do know what's up.  Sell your snake oil elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-03-08 18:09:08
No, the same cannot be said, in any way, at all.
Please do not attempt to spread lies and disinformation here.
Classic and Ultimate have zero to do with bitcoin,
nor are they *at all* worthy technologically, even if they offered a legitimate altcoin.
We've seen it all before, and it has been debunked ad absurdum.
You're not even offering any solid opinions on a solution.
SegWit is the way forward.  
The large and knowledgeable bitcoin dev team is  on it.
And Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:47:06
Centralization in the context of cryptocurrency has to do with mining power and nodes, not software.
Neither of these abusive hijacking attempts, ClassicCoin, or UnlimitedCoin, have anything to do with the Bitcoin project.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:14:03
They aren't any type of legitimate altcoin even.
BU has a minuscule dev team (with little skill at that).
The only thing they have going for them is a huge advertising budget provided by corporate backers they've scammed,
and disreputable mining concerns that are already dangerously huge, trying to blackmail Bitcoin.
There is no way this crap would ever make it as a legitimate altcoin, so they don't even try. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:19:50
That (1MB nonsense) is not the only lie.

downvoting truth?  Please, either inform yourself of cryptocurrency jargon, or step aside and let the adults talk.
This thread serves no purpose but blatant disinformation, and your comment is just as harmful.
We've been seeing WAY too much of this shit-slinging lately. Someone has deep pockets and is paying well for this kind of onslaught. 
This thread should really be banned as the spam that it is.
@_date: 2016-01-28 15:18:22
People "need" to discuss "classic-coin" as much as they do any other altcoin. Not at all.  They are completely separate projects, and should be treated that way.
That some yahoos decided to try to fuck bitcoin over by programming clients to use the blockchain in wrong ways does not mean it has anything to do with bitcoin. Quite the opposite.
Fork away, go make altcoins to your heart's content. If they are better I'll use them. Leave bitcoin, and its existing infrastructure, out of it.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:27:18
Hi /btc!
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:43:29
So the vast majority of cryptocurrency experts and extremely knowledgeable advocates calling scams such as BU an attack,
are, in your opinion, Ignorant.
Yah, err,  sorry Mr. Whale, but actual reality disagrees with your assessment.  You might want to rethink who you're actually talking about.
XT, Classic, now UnlimitedCoin are nothing other than dangerous hijacking attempts.
there are no serious opinions to the contrary.  What there is though, is a huge slew of blatant propaganda and disinformation behind them, paid for by greedy corporate interests.
Very much like the massively ignorant and abusive disinformation,  ney, downright shit-slinging you're spreading here.
Time to get back to /btc.
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:31:07
Facts are not straw men.  Anyone that knows the first thing about cryptocurrency knows that increasing max block size willy-nilly (as scams like UnlimitedCoin want) would lead to massive mining centralization.
The "strawman" is trying to assert otherwise, for various unscientific reasons, with zero factual support.  (As said scams love to do.)
No serious cryptocurrency expert or knowledgeable advocate would agree with such lunacy.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:21:17
There is one implementation of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin project itself.
There are many altcoins, of which UnlimitedCoin is one.
Just, BU is not legitimate, choosing to attempt to hijack the resources of another Open Source project instead of offering bona fide competition.
Such shady behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just cryptocurrency.
Therefore, BU can't even really be called an altcoin, it is simply a get-rich-quick scam, like so many others before it.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:40:39
It does though, completely.  There is zero reason to add that +2mb, as segwit already includes it!

This is not an "attitude", it is simple fact, pointed out by an extremely large number of extremely reputable cryptocurrency experts and advocates.
UnlimitedCoin is a scam. Just another hostile hijacking attempt.
Such shady behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice 
in all of open source, not just the cryptocurrency community.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:16:53
bitcoin.com has nothing to do with the Bitcoin project.
bitcoin.org is the bona fide bitcoin team's site.
@_date: 2016-01-29 17:56:46
Using code is not a problem at all. This is whay we have so many altcoins. They are forks.
The difference is, respectable altcoins have their own projects, and blockchains.
Coding a client that is incompatible, to use the original project's infrastructure, is extremely abusive.
Altcoins galore. This is a good thing.  If this "classic-coin" wants to be successful, let it. I'll use it if it's better than bitcoin. What is completely abusive is for them to try to take over the already established infrastructure bitcoin uses.
This new altcoin needs its own blockchain, as well as its own forums (including subreddit).
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:49:11
We've seen the likes all too often.  Lookin' at you ClassicCoin.
Obvious hostile takeover attempts are obvious.
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:33:37
Jezus,  
just as much disinformation and propaganda as Ver is pushing.
Nobody worth a damn agrees with Ver on his UnimitedCoin scam, or any of the other ones he's been behind.
Trying to apologize for the damage the man has caused is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:43:36
Only for a very short time, if at all.  Hard to imagine anyone offering actual money for UnlimitedCoin in the first place.
If anyone does, sure, take full advantage, but do it quick! it won't last long.
you see, BU is not even a legitimate altcoin.
If they used their own blockchain, as any respectable bitcoin-based altcoin does, everything would be fine. In fact, legitimate competition is good!
Attempting to hijack the blockchain of another project is the problem, and a large reason why this scam was bound to fail from the beginning, like so many others before it.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:51:41
And for damn good reason.
Willy nilly increasing max block size with zero protection against the even *further* mining power centralization that would promote is lunacy.
Ain't gonna happen.  The only people still pushing for that are get-rich-quick scam artists, and a few cryptocurrency newbies that have bought into their scams.
SegWit is all ready to go, offering larger block size.  and said scam artists are actively trying to block it, because they cannot profit from such a sane and reasonable solution.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:42:05
It doesn't take a genius to know that bona fide Bitcoin would continue on like always.
This scam BU never stood a chance, for so many reasons.
the entire thing is hype and propaganda, and is really getting very tiresome.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:54:57
If there was a threat of such happening, it would be dealt with.
We'd have time to put protections in place.
That's not what 99% of the "Hard Fork!" nonsense being spewed here (and other legitimate cryptocurrency forums) is about though, is it?
No, the vast majority of Hard Fork enthusiasts are pushing propaganda on one hostile takeover attempt or the other.  ClassicCoin, UnlimitedCoin, a long line of get-rich-quick scams with large corporate-backed advertising budgets (and little else).
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:17:57
There is no "diplomacy" in "concessions" with destructive actors.
He wants complete, monopoly control of bitcoin. He has no business being in business, or having anything to do with cryptocurrency.
Such disreputable mining outfits are to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:59:45
We can easily deduce that the VAST majority of Bitcoin users fully support SegWit.
Conversely, it is very easy to see that the only ones supporting this latest hostile takeover attempt (BU) are other scam artists, and the poor people / businesses they have duped.
The UnlimitedCoin team is severely lacking in credibility and integrity, not to mention technological merit. 
This is very clear to anyone that knows the first thing about cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:27:14
Oh god, what a huge load of crap.

The only thing trying to cripple bitcoin is the hostile takeover attempt by an altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:28:53
Zero need.
IF UnlimitedCoin decided to go ahead with their attack,
they would quickly cease to exist.
Bitcoin would go on, as always.  There is zero need for a POW change.
@_date: 2016-03-23 15:24:06
Any project piggybacking onto the bitcoin blockchain is hijacking bitcoin resources. 
Would you like to just invite all altcoins to use the bitcoin blockchain? Do you realize how absurd this idea is?
No, altcoins belong on their *own* blockchain. Other projects cluttering it up are being destructive.
If bona fide bitcoin clients cannot use that transaction, it is not a bitcoin transaction and has no place on the bitcoin blockchain.
This is very simple, and should be obvious. Please stop trying to defend such destructive behavior. It is to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:28:05
Well, it's blatantly obvious that they are in no way equally valid.
Anyone that can stomach that yahoo Ver's bullshit long enough...
heh heh.. he really is the best advertising for how NOT to run an altcoin. 
He and his projects have zero to do with bitcoin though, 
and should not be given the opportunity to pretend such. :(
@_date: 2017-03-24 07:45:59
There can be no "common ground" with scams like BU, and the huge blocks that disreputable miners push for.
They have proven to have zero interest in logic or reason, nor the longevity or safety of Bitcoin.
Again, there can be no "common ground" with such destructive agents. 
Segwit is a very intelligent and safe increase in block size. It also opens the door to much more efficient use of them.
As is abundantly clear, the get-rich-quick crowd have no interest in such. :(
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:15:16
err...  some huge mining concerns are now very busy trying to completely destroy or control the network.
Not to mention backing blatant hijacking scams like BU. :(
If miners act so unscrupulously, they fully deserve to lose their investments.
@_date: 2017-03-31 09:08:00
Because bitcoin.com has nothing to do with Bitcoin,
it is a scam, and directly hostile to the Bitcoin project.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:32:54
Actual knowledge about how it actually works.
Scams like UnlimitedCoin, ClassicCoin, XT and a row of others before them, have demonstrated they do not.
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:26:24
Hostile hijacking attempts like UnlimitedCoin are not interested, in the least, in facts.
Ver is nothing but a get-rich-quick scam artist, and has had every opportunity to act responsibly.  He refuses.
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:22:29
There is no legitimate "debate" and never was.
There was also never a question of "consensus".
Again, there is no reason to "debate" with spam.
Nobody is going to turn over bitcoin to a tiny team of secretive, corporate backed devs. 
Bitcoin is a HUGE project, with a HUGE, very knowedgeable dev team.  
If these yahoos that constanty scream "BLOCK SIZE" against all logical reason, actually had any integrity, they'd just make an altcoin.
They can't, because their get-rich quick scam would never actually WORK.    So they keep trying to hijack another altcoin project (bitcoin) that actually does work.
They can't make a quick buck from an actually functioning cryptocurrency though...  shame for them huh?  And shame ON them for trying. :(
@_date: 2017-03-12 17:04:05
there wouldn't be a "new front runner". 
There would be Bitcoin, as always, and a failed takeover attempt with valueless coin.
Anyway, what theoretical reason would there be for a hard fork? 
And what would this other "runner" possibly be in your opinion?
Please don't say that UnlimitedCoin scam.  lol... not a chance.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:28:09
There is nothing to thank unlimited for. Quite the opposite. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:22:36
Wat? 
Bitcoin is never going to completely replace fiat. It was never meant to.
Trying for this ridiculous ideal, you'd gladly hand over bitcoin (and surely all cryptocurrency) to the hands of the international banks and greedy forces that own them.
No thanks.  Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general is valuable for other reasons than fiat is, but fiat will still be useful, and exist.
To try to make the two the same would destroy crypto completely.
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:04:21
UnlimitedCoin has nothing going for it but "social gaming".  Thier methods are very much akin to ShareBlue, CTR &amp; Co.
They have little to no technological merit:
Even if they decided to produce a bona fide altcoin, nobody would use it, so instead they spread lies and disinformation.
Cryptocurrency in general, and Bitcoin specifically, needs hardening against such social attacks, as well as more sophisticated technical ones.  We've seen such scams, and such despicable social propaganda methods before. (hello XT, ClassicCoin)  UnlimitedCoin will not be the last.
Serious cryptocurrency enthusiasts are well aware of corporate propaganda mills such as /btc. Still they do damage. Derailing legitimate, productive problem-solving, and trapping newbies to cryptocurrency (for a while anyway) with their lies.
Disreputable miners also have a loud bark, but very little bite, unless they can use such blatant hijacking attempts for their own gain. :(  This is what we're seeing now with this latest BU scam.
And it's a well known fact that even more destructive elements would love nothing more than to flat out destroy bitcoin, not just co-opt it for their own profit. It is hard to imagine anything other than the Chinese government being fully aware, and looking to profit from, such abusive tactics.
"Game Theory" definitely includes lies and propaganda.  It is the only context that actually applies to scams like BU.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:02:30
Cryptocurrency culture has learned a lot from such scams.
It is getting easier to spot them. The more they push their blatant abuse, the easier it is to debunk.
Hell, I remember when that scam ClassicCoin had its run a couple years back.  UnlimitedScam does not have it so easy.
The next get-rich-quick scam, and those that follow, will be up against an ever increasing resistance to their corporate-backed bullshit.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:18:22
Like the lies and slander pushed with corporate backed advertising dollars by scams like XT, Classic, and BU?
Or the straight up shit-slinging from huge, greedy, disreputable mining organizations trying to hijack bitcoin?
If that's what you're saying, then you'd be right.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:01:35
There is no real drama in the community.
What there is is a fairly constant barrage of disinformation and propaganda from cesspools like /btc, run by corporate backed scams.
We've seen this so often before.  XT, Classic, Unlimited,  and there will be mroe, so long as Bitcoin is so successful.
There never was any real drama though, just a bunch of corporate advertising money to spam get-rich-quick schemes.
Fortunately, the more they try, the easier they are to spot.
@_date: 2017-03-11 10:31:55
The Fed is only "federal" in name. A very misleading name.
It has zero to do with any part of the american government, at all.
There is a laughably tiny and weak "oversight" committee run by our government, just to keep up pretenses, but they have no real power at all. :(
"The Fed" is completely owned and run by a conglomeration of international banking concerns.
Again, it has zero to do with our government. This is exactly why it is so dangerous. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:03:23
There was no such "promise". 
Indiscriminately raising max block size with zero protections is lunacy.
SegWit *has* a block size increase, plus much more.

What bitcoin "executives"?
Bitcoin is an open source project.
Scams like XT, Classic, and now BU on the other hand....

oh god, /btc speaks about itself.
There is no "debate" with spam and scam.
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:15:35
LOL...  no.
The only ones supporting this newest scam are other get-rich-quick artists, and the poor people they've duped.
There is a severe lack of technical merit behind the UnlimitedCoin project, run by a tiny group of secretive, corporate backed devs.
If they wanted to provide bona fide competition, they'd make a legitimate altcoin (which is what BU is). 
They cannot, so they've gone with shadily attempting to hijack the reputation, name, and resources of another actually worthy Open Source project.
This type of behavior is discouraged in all of Open Source, not just cryptocurrency.  It is fully destructive.
@_date: 2016-03-21 22:41:05
Is it though?  Does it use the bona fide bitcoin network? Bitcoin blockchain? Then it is aiming to clutter up the parent project and deserves no respect. 
Even trying to piggyback something on the side is dubious. Trying to twist bitcoin into something more like fiat is very dangerous. The motivations behind such a project deserve the utmost scrutiny.
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:41:16
Who says they're being rational? 
There are plenty of powerful players that would love nothing more than to run cryptocurrency into the ground, or completely co-opt it, turning it into another profitable fiat.
It is very easy to imagine the insanely wealthy banking industry burning a few hundred million to do just such a thing. Or corrupt corporate-controlled governments.
What might not seem "rational" might be because you're looking at the threat too closely, and need to step back to see the big picture.
In the end it makes no difference, and navel-gazing discussions about "morality" are rather useless.
How cryptocurrency can protect itself against the abuse (as embodied lately in UnlimitedCoin and the shady mining conglomerates backing them).
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:00:52
Negotiating with people trying to blackmail you into submission is a horrible idea. 
Zero need to either. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:43:40
no,  /btc is a majority of propaganda money paid for by destructive corporate investors, or worse.
And a tiny minority of poeople that fall for their bullshit, before they actually learn about the technology that cryptocurrency actually uses.
Then the newly informed and learning leave /btc, and other cesspools of disinformation, or are kicked out for pointing out the bullshit that abounds in such propaganda forums. 
Here on /bitcoin people can talk about ACTUAL cryptocurrency tech... as well as other actually legitimate cryptocurrency forums.
This thread has beens brigaded by /btc and their like. But threads like this, full of cancer, are easy to spot for people that actually know a thing or two about cryptocurrency.
OP shows a prime example of the destructive behavior and outright bullshit that is slung from forums like /btc.
Realy, it was a mistake to call out their bullshit, it's better to just ignore it.
Damn is that crap annoying after a while though.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:11:36
Oh god,  seriously?  
Ok, back to /btc with you.  
Such ridiculous spam is not welcome here.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:25:40
Ridicule of miners trying for a hostile takeover of bitcoin is fully rational.
Bitcoin (no "core" needed), and all of open source discourages such destructive behavior with extreme prejudice.
You need to stop hanging out on that corporate propaganda mill /btc so much. :(
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:48:05
That is not a fork.  That is a hostile hijacking attempt.
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:23:47


This is an incredibly important distinction.  Hijacking another project's resources is an asshole move. Discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source. 
Offering *legitimate* competition means forking the source in a separate project. Different name, different blockchain in the case of cryptocurrency. This is called an altcoin, and is a Good Thing.


There is no "debate". Hostile takeover attempts such as XT, Classic, and now UnlimitedCoin are just that.
They lack all legitimacy, integrity, and at least in the case of Unlimited, technical merit.
The only thing they have going for them is tons of corporate advertising money to push this fantasy of legitimate "debate". 
This is a disgrace is right; against everything that general business practice requires, not just Open Source, cryptocurrency, and not just Bitcoin. 
Again, a true fork is called an altcoin.  UnlimitedCoin is nothing of the sort.
At this point, having this threat of a hostile takeover attempt actually happen would be very good.
Unlimited would very quickly cease to exist. Their corporate propaganda money would dry up, as the backers they've duped cut their losses.  
Then legitimate, serious altcoins could move on from the attack.
Unfortunately, it seems the Unlimited scam artists and their disreputable backers never plan on actually committing to such an attack. Bitcoin will always have such destructive hijacking attempts aimed at it, from shady corporate interests or shady government agencies. A long line of them before this latest, as described, and there will be more.
This latest round will push the Bitcoin project, and all of cryptocurrency, to hardening against such social attacks with no technological merit, as well as more sophisticated technological ones.
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:52:49
They can *TRY* a hard fork all they want,
and it will fail miserably.  Nobody is going to trust a tiny, secretive dev team and their get-rich-quick scam.
Whoever follows them off that cliff will simply lose their investment,
and bitcoin will be just fine, as it has been through so many other hostile hijacking attempts.
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:00:51
None, and nobody would care, unless to put try them on a blacklist. 
BU is a scam. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:03:36
btc.com runs a mining pool. Now they have their own wallet too.
They are a separate project and have nothing to do with bitcoin.org.
bitcoin.org (run by the actual Bitcoin project) has a large list of bona fide bitcoin wallets that they promote the use of:
[Choose your Bitcoin wallet](
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:13:29
This latest scam (BU) isn't even worth mentioning in such numbers,
any more than the scams before it (XT, Classic, etc...).
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:19:13
There is no real debate.
There are a few shady scam artists (BU) spreading a lot of lies and propaganda trying to make it look like a legitimate debate.
All they actually have going for them are deep pockets of their corporate backers,
and shady mining outfits trying to hijack bitcoin for profit. :(
We've seen attacks like this before, with all the shilling and shit-slinging that accompanies it.  XT, Classic, and now BU, and there will be others as they each crash and burn.
Fortunately, they're getting easier to spot nowadays.
@_date: 2017-03-23 10:21:52
There is no other "side" to the story. 
There is Bitcoin,
and there are hostile takeover attempts like XT, Classic and now UnlimitedCoin.
The latter's "story" is nothing but a string of lies and blatant propaganda.
Such scams are severely lacking in respectability and technical prowess, to put it very nicely.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:41:51
We are talking about open source cryptocurrency projects, not apples.
There are objective fitness tests when considering the viability of code. 
UnlimitedCoin hasn't learned that lesson very well yet, as they've shown us abundantly. The entire idea is ridiculous.
So no, it is not subjective as "apples taste bad", or anything else so juvanile.
The vast majority of experts and very knowledgeable cryptocurrency advocates would never dream of putting money into a scam like UnlimitedCoin. 
Again, for damn good reason.  It is, in fact, a hostile takeover attempt, aka, an attack.
You can say "well I hold the opposite opinion!"  but don't be surprised that nobody takes you seriously.  Especially when you have absolutely zero logic to back it up and just spout childinsh things like this "apples" comment.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:22:48
And, yet again, the exact same copy-pasted text from another /btc propagandist.
Anyone can see how much this account contributes to that corporate-backed propaganda mill.
Sorry dude, you and your buddies don't seem to realize, your spam is unwelcome, and very, very obvious.
The only hostile takeover attempts is such scams as XTC, Classic, and now Unlimited, that such corporate disinformation mills as /btc constantly promote.
There is only one bona fide Bitcoin project.
If you lot (and your corporate masters) want to offer true competition, 
make a legitimate altcoin, instead of trying to hijack the resources of another Open Source project.
Of course, UnlimitedScam cannot. Not with their ludicrously inept dev team.
They have shown themselves unworthy again and again, not only through their horrendous quality control,
but the blatant shit-slinging and disinformation they spew here, and other legitimate cryptocurrency forums. :( 
(the above mentioned copypasta I'm responding to here is one of the milder examples)
@_date: 2016-01-27 20:22:55
We do talk about altcoins here a lot, but it is hardly the place for a base of operations for any others than bitcoin.
Fork away all you want, leave bitcoin out of it. That's the way to keep bitcoin healthy.  If the altcoin they call "classic" is better, people will use it. This is a non-issue.
It really does need its own subreddit, and definitely should have its own blockchain. Trying to forcefully take over bitcoin's established infrastructure is no good for anyone but a select few looking to profit from it.
Until this happens, no, things are not improving at all.  This sub is for bitcoin.  Their altcoin needs its own project.
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:59:09
A very small amount of people want it really, really bad.
They are fully free to make another altcoin. If it is so superior, it will be used.
Leave bitcoin out of it.
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:32:32
Still no idea what you're talking about without specifics. 
Anyway, the point stands that the "hard fork" hype is overwhelmingly disinformation from destructive influences.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:14:36
This is exactly what BU, and other scams before them, are attempting.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:16:58
Exactly.  If these yahoos had their was, there quickly would be no bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:20:35
both hostile, destructive takeover attempts.
Let's go ahead and add ClassicCoin to that number.
UnlimitedCoin is just the latest.  It too will crash and burn.
There will be more too. Thankfully, they're getting easier and easier to spot. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 16:38:08
You're now talking to, and about, nobody but yourself.
You do offer good advice.  Please, take it. 
Also, we all noticed you refusing to tell what project you're promoting.
@_date: 2017-03-23 10:55:31
This sub is *extremely* tolerant to spam from scams such as BU.
Complaining about some fantasy "censorship" is completely ridiculous.
If someone breaks the forum rules in such an *extreme* way as to *actually* have a post deleted, or even get banned (extremely doubtful) then they damn well deserved it.
Coming in here screeching "censorship", when there could be nothing further from the truth, will just get someone labelled as an obvious propagandist by actual cryptocurrency advocates. And for very good reason.
Personally, I already have /zimmah tagged as "anti-bitcoin shill" from other such shit-slinging shenanigans.
If I had my way, him and his /btc posse of disinformation pushers would have been banned long ago,
but as is abundantly clear, the mods here are extremely tolerant. That his obvious spam above still stands, is just more proof.
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:07:22
BU is nothing but bad.  It is worth saying whenever the subject comes up.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:59:22
Oh please,  understanding that BU is just another in a long line of scams only takes the most rudimentrary understanding of cryptocurrency.
Nobody in their right minds is willing to turn Bitcoin over to a tiny, secretive, and technically incompetent dev team.
Not to mention the completely shady practices BU engages in.
And don't try to say that this sub doesn't allow extreme ideas. Legitimate cryptocurrency forums all over the web (including this one) are bombarded by disinformation, shilling and downright shit-slinging from scams such as XT, Classic, now BU.
By all rights, this crap should be binned as the spam it is, but the mods here are *extremely* tolerant. 
If you ever did wind up going soooo far over the line to get your post deleted, 
it would be nobody's fault but your own.
@_date: 2016-03-21 22:34:13
Anything that clutters up the blockchain is BAD.
If someone wants to add some extra something or other with zero disruption of normal bitcoin activity, then fine.
Really, if they want respect, they'd just make an altcoin. If it is truly better, people will use it.
There is a huge push by big corporations, banks, governments, etc..., to try to twist bitcoin into something more like fiat. That is a dangerous road and we need to be very careful about shady motivations.
One of the very best things about bitcoin is that it is open for everyone. Trying to put controls on it (as so many would LOVE to do, for Profit) is worthy of all our caution.
@_date: 2016-03-13 08:16:07
Just more derailing tactics. If you look at OP's other comments, it's very obvious they are extremely hostile to Bitcoin.
Sadly, when mods axe such destructive and less-than-useless threads, the enemy only scream "Censorship!"  :(
All in all, the mod team here has done a good job, considering the finances being poured into messing with public forums like this one, by these destructive agents.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:47:43
The uninitiated / newbies here just learning need to be aware of such destructive influences. 
People that have been around cryptocurrency a while have seen this all again and again of course, but some new people might still be taken in. (I suppose that's the point of their spamming here).
I think that bot is very useful, and thanks for pointing it out.
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:53:54
That would be less than useless.
Please do not encourage such destructive scams.
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:32:18
Bingo.  This is simply future-proofing.  
If anything, the ridiculous idea of  "micro-transactions" (less than say, a penny) being included on-blockchain would negate the necessity of so many decimal places.
If anything, such ridiculous "decimal-place arguments" argue against themselves.
Micro-transactions were always meant to be clumped together,
as the original Bitcoin code set the path for Level2 transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:10:33
No, UnlimitedCoin has zero to do with bitcoin,
except trying to aggressively hijack Bitcoin's resources.
This type of shady behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source.  
Only other scam artists would support such scam.
BU has zero credibility, and next to zero technical merit.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:04:52
Seriously?  UnlimitedCoin was DOA, and has gone downhill from there.  
Nobody in their right mind is going to turn Bitcoin over to a tiny, incompetent dev team,
nor the shady scam producer running it. We've seen this crap all too often (hello XT, Classic).
The only thing UnlimitedCoin has going for it is corporate advertising money they use to spam disinformation, and downright shit-slinging on legitimate cryptocurrency forums such as this one.
BU is yet another abusive hijacking attempt from the corporate sector, or worse.
@_date: 2016-03-24 10:29:57
I hear you. This kind of disinformation is entirely too common these last months.
I am as annoyed with it as anyone else.  Just please don't propagate such propaganda. 
I say again, decentralization in the context of cryptocurrency *exclusively* means mining power.
It has zero to do with various implementations piggybacking on the bitcoin blockchain (or any other project).
On that we obviously agree.  And I'll aim this at the spammer you answered. You're right there, I responded one comment too deep.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:03:46
err.. IF BU or any other shady scam actually tried a real attack....
running that full node would be a very good defense against them spamming up the Bitcoin blockchain with their bullshit blocks.
You can fully validate your coins because you have the entire *legitimate* bitcoin blockchain there to confirm against.
If there was such an attack (highly doubtful with bu, but Ver and ChinaBU might get desperate before they fade)
leteitimate miners, wallets, exchanges and nodes would simply ignore their spam blocks.
Wait, you work for the scam bitcoin.COM? 
then you most likely are not running a legitimate node in the first place,
Everyone knows that .com site has zero to do with legitimate Bitcoin.
The actual bitcoin.org site, run by the bona fide bitcoin project, is the only one that has legitimate claim to that name, and the bitcoin blockchain.
Back to /btc with you now.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:50:05

Get lost, troll.
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:32:53
/btc regularly brigades here with exactly such lies, propaganda, disinformation... 
and it regularly degrades quickly to downright shit-slinging when the fallacies in their favorite ~~projects~~ scams are pointed out.
That place has nothing whatsoever to do with legitimate cryptocurrency enthusiasm. 
It's a cesspool of get-rich-quick artists promoting hostile takeover attempts.
The destructive lies and behavior in OP's example are fully their MO.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:08:07


Is this just one person spewing this ridiculous bullshit, 
or are they all copy / pasting the *exact same text* from the same script?
There is one bitcoin project.
BU has zero claim to the bitcoin name, nor do any others.
Only shady hijacking attempts like XT, Classic, and now Unlimited want to claim so, and show themselves as completely unworthy in the attempt.
Nobody is going to take a minuscule "dev" team (what all 4 of them?) backed only by shady corporate interests and disreputable mining outfits seriously.
Not to mention that they have shown themselves completely technologically inept.  Producing one deadly bug after another, and spamming the production blockchain of the parent project (bitcoin) with their crap.
They would never survive as a legitimate altcoin, let alone this ludicrous and abusive takeover attempt.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:48:54
Not everywhere has the wonderful bandwidth you do.
The awesome thing about cryptocurrency is helping the Average Joe, not just those wealthy enough to take advantage of it.
Your entire "argument" would push Bitcoin into being just another centrally controlled Fiat.   
No, no thanks.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:39:20
Anyone with the attitude displayed above does not not understand the first thing about Open Source software.
ANYONE can contribute code to a project.  ANYONE can fork that project's code.
That is where many, many legitimate altcoins come from. Legitimate competition is a Good thing.
Unlimited, and other scams before it (xt, classic, etc..) is an altcoin, but not a legitimate one because:
while the source code is open,  another project's *resources* are not.
this in includes the parent project's name, and in this case, blockchain.
An aggressive hijacking attempt such as the shady projects mentioned above have attempted
are discouraged with extreme prejudice in the Open Source world, and for damn good reason.
Anyway, even if the yahoos coding this silly UnlimitedScam did make a legitimate altcoin,
nobody would use it anyway, not after the "dev team" (what 4 of them? lol) have displayed such obvious ineptitude.  
Not to mention being backed by nothing but shady corporate interests and disreputable mining concerns. :(
Oh, and all the blatant disinformation and propaganda, even downright shit-slinging UnlimitecCoin has aimed at legitimate cryptocurrency enthusiasts and *worthy* developers.
Very clear they have a huge advertising budget, seeing how often and brutally they spam bona fide cryptocurrency forums with their crap (this one included).
/btc is nothing but a corporate-run propaganda mill.  Nothing worthy has every come out of such cesspools of disinformation.  Please stop listening to, and spreading such destructive nonsense. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 22:38:20
there is no way the "smear" /btc
They do just fine themselves. :(
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:45:37
There is zero "crusade" against.
/btc is simply a corporate-backed propaganda mill. 
They and their ilk are on the attack constantly.  Legitimate cryptocurrency forums deal with this spam constantly, including here at /bitcoin.
The hostile takeover attempts promoted by such (ClassicCoin, UnlimitedCoin, etc...)  have proven to be of zero worth technically. Let alone the downright disinformation, propaganda  and shit-slinging they spend so much of their advertising budget on.
They have zero to do with bitcoin, at all, except their attempt to co-opt or destroy it.
No serious bitcoin enthusiast holds such destructive projects in anything but contempt.  Their method of attempting to hijack another legitimate open source project is discouraged with extreme  prejudice by the entire open source community, not just cryptocurrency.
There is zero need to add the descriptor "core" to bitcoin.  There is only the bitcoin project.  The name belongs to it, as well as its blockchain.
There are plenty of other legitimate altcoins.  Classiccoin, Ultimatecoin, &amp; Co are not among them. They have proven themselves unworthy of consideration not only by their shady as shit actions, but by the ridiculous joke of the technology they're built on.
They have zero going for them but tons of corporate advertising money. 
Still, bitcoin is doing just fine, and will continue to, long after this latest threat has crashed and burned, like the others before it.
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:59:47
That UnlimitedCoin is an agressive and destructive hijacking attempt with little to no technological merit is not a "theory", unless you're talking about theories such as gravity.
They constantly spam legitimate cryptocurrency forums (this one and many others) with blatant disinformation, propaganda and downright shit-slinging.  Paid for by greedy corporate backers.
The only people that do not detest such destructive behavior are other get-rich-quick scam artists, such as the disreputable mining conglomerates that are taking advantage of this completely manufactured "debate". 
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:46:52


Talking only about about /btc here.  The projection is cringeworthy. 
We hear all too much of this crap from people there, about exactly what *they* do so often, 
but trying to blame it on others.
Serious cryptocurrency forums (such as this one) are rather tired of such blatant spam.
Thankfully, it has been done so often, it's rather easy to spot nowadays.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:11:20
He's not interested in anything but complete control, or alternatively, destruction, of bitcoin.
These assholes want monopoly control of transaction fees.

Oh god, this exact same copy-pated text, YET AGAIN.
Is this crap all from the same person, or do they all have the same script? 
This account is a huge /btc contributor.  'nuff siad. :(
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:17:06
UnlimitedCoin was DOA, and everything they've done just makes it more obvious they are nothing other than a hostile hijacking attempt with zero technical merit whatsoever.
Please, before you spew the nonsense you've read on the corporate propaganda mills such as of /btc and such, 
[Inform yourself on The Astounding Incompetence, Negligence, and Dishonesty of the "Bitcoin" Unlimited Developers](
(quotes mine, they have zero to do with the bitcoin project, and never have)
@_date: 2017-03-23 10:23:57
Good way to describe scams like UnlimitedCoin.
There's damn good reason people don't want to use it too;
They know how cryptocurrency and open source actually works,
and Unlimited fails miserably at both, quite willfully.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:34:28
hah.. your own propaganda chart there proves it was litterally the opposite of "gradually". 
It is so blatantly obvious, and who knows if this is even factual, seeing as it's just an image with no source.
Fact is, there was an enormous, practically simultaneous patching campaign of UnlimitedCoin software that could only have been from a centralized source.
And anyway, just the fact that there way yet ANOTHER catastrophic failure in their code shows the severe lack of technological merit the tiny BU "dev team" has.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:03:41
With the alternative of being *brutally forced* to use some rediculous scam like UnlimitedCoin, ClassicCoin, etc, by greedy get-rich-quick artists.
SegWit is the way forward. It is FAR, FAR superior to any other proposal. There is not even another offering that has dependable code, let alone integrity or trustworthiness.
@_date: 2016-03-24 09:08:43
This post's title is blatant and biased disinformation.
**Decentralization for cryptocurrency means mining power exclusively.**
There is no such thing as "implementation decentralization" as this title so falsely implies.
The only "control" issue is that of the poster, and whatever project they are working for, with such dishonest wording.
This type of propaganda has plagued Bitcoin forums for months. 
*Please be aware of the actual facts:*






@_date: 2017-03-15 19:36:12
There are only a very tiny ammount of people that do.  The get-rich-quick scam artists running the hijacking attempt.
Then there are a ton of shills paid by their corporate-funded advertising budget.
Sure, there are a few cryptocurrency newbs taken in by disinformation mills like /btc, but when they learn a bit, they flee such cesspools with a quickness.
This attack is coming from already too large, destructive corporate influences, not "people". 
We've seen this happen all too often.  XTcoin, ClassicCoin, now UnlimitedCoin.  There will probably be more, so long bitcoin is successful. :/
Thankfully, the more they push their bullshit takeover attempts, the easier they are to spot.
@_date: 2016-01-14 09:35:42
They are, however, detrimental to bitcoin. 
Fork away, many alcoins exist. Leave bitcoin itself out of it. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 14:20:12
There is one definition of altcoin.
Alternative implementations are, by definition, incompatible with bitcoin. 
Why are you still going on about Segwit? Back to the subject please.
Hard fork IS BAD.  There is so much more harm done with such a thing, especially when the new dev team (whoever it is that you are promoting) is so tiny.
No dude, if a hard fork is actually the answer, then it will be done by the actual bitcoin dev team. 
That is, has been, and will be the "concensus".  There was never a serious question about it. Please don't put too much weight in the propaganda money pouring into such silly ideas.
There is no need to rush into this. "Accepted" is a ridiculous term, as you yourself are pointing out with your critique of Segregated Witness.
I'm still curious what altcoin you're promoting.  What project would you like to have take over the bitcoin blockchain? That is the serious question here.
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:48:59
Shady as fuck how he spun the bullshit going down.
I wonder how much of Rodg's money he got out of that deal?
Money he's since spent trying to scam and manipulate Bitcoin, and others, into yet another easy to control fiat.
Attempt to apologize for his despicable actions, complete lack of integrity, or even a modicum of morals, all you want,
just don't be surprised if you're labelled as the same.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:13:29
/btc is brigading here pretty hard,
yet again.  :-(
@_date: 2017-03-28 09:54:58
You can't spend less than a penny with "cash" either.
Micro-transactions were never meant to stay on-blockchain.
The original code set the roadmap for 2nd level transactions,
and were clearly referenced in the original whitepaper.

@_date: 2017-03-20 01:26:11
Naw,  bitcoin will continue on.  Slow n steady, as it always has.
@_date: 2016-03-24 13:07:09
Ok, just stop with your nonsense "alternative implementation".
You are no longer talking about bitcoin, you are talking about an altcoin.  
I'll not argue with you about the merits of Segwit, only the merits of turning the blockchain over to whatever tiny dev team you seem to be promoting.
I do understand your point, there needs to be, at some time in the future, a decision made about the way forward. This is not such a huge issue that we need to turn over bitcoin development to any altcoin team.
There is plenty of time to work things out, and there are a LOT of people on the bitcoin team working on that. Optimizing the blocksize we have now, without running over a cliff in a panic is very important.
All the screaming of DOOM! and HARD FORK NOW! is ridiculous, and honestly, very annoying. 
We've been over this twice now.  I still am waiting on your answer:
What altcoin are you so aggressively promoting?
If it acts respectably, having its own blockchain and forums, and is *actually better*, then people will use it.
Cluttering up bitcoin forums (this one, and others) with fantasy takeover attempts is highly destructive. Same for the bitcoin blockchain.
On this I hope we can agree.
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:11:49
BU is a hostile takeover attempt. No tech merit, or trustworthyness. 
This is abundantly clear.  
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:27:24
These scam artists don't deserve the attention.
They are actually talking about themselves.
So much projection it's pitiful.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:28:54
He's saying exactly the opposite.  
Bitcoin is valuable by itself, not because of miners.
Miners are infinitely replaceable.
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:45:10
Miners would be complete iditots mining useless coin that nobody wants.  (lookin' at you BU).
Your entire idea about how this works is completely backwards. It is called supply and demand.  If there is a demand (nodes running bitcoin), there will be miners for it.
If all miners suddenly started mining only some other altcoin (BU say), they'd simply lose all their money, and other miners would step in to mine bitcoin, taking advantage of the vacuum.
Of course, that's a silly scenario, because miners are not going to mine useless coin.  They might try to influence it to their advantage, but ultimately, they're just acting incredibly shady doing so.
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:17:00
For damn good reason though.
UnlimitedCoin is nothing more than yet another in a long line of get-rich-quick scams.
Their tiny, secretive, corporate-backed dev team are severely lacking in credibility, moral integrity and technological merit.
Yes, even ignoring their destructive hijacking attempt and  all the propaganda / lies they spread,
simply on a technological basis, their project was doomed from the start. Basically, they don't even HAVE a project,
it isn't even a legitimate altcoin. It is simply another attack on Bitcoin, greedily trying to steal another project's name and resources for their own selfish gain.
There is zero reason to remain unbiased when discussing such destructive influences.  We don't try to remain unbiased as we throw spam into the bin either.
Where we *can* agree though is that actual Bitcoin users are in control. Such a scam will simply be worked around and go up in a puff of smoke, like so many others before it.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:19:24
there is no "BU community"
What there is is yet another hostile takeover attempt, as others before it (xt, classic), and a shitload of corporate backed propaganda money being spent trying to spread the lie that actual cryptocurrency enthusiasts want anything to do with such scams.
There might be a tiny minority of actual newbies taken in by their lies, but as soon as they learn a bit about cryptocurrency, they flee from corporate shilling mills such as /btc, and the scams such promote.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:23:28
/btc is brigading hardcore, yet again. :(
@_date: 2017-03-06 00:18:11
Sorry, /btc IS bad.  And it has been shown again, and again.
I'd strongly suggest you stay far clear of that cesspool of disinformation and scam artists.
At first, when I was learning about crypto currencies, I did hang out there for a month or two.  It is very quickly apparent that there is zero actual science or even logic behind the scams that are pushed there.
ClassicCoin, UltimateCoin...  they have nothing going for them but huge amounts of corporate funded advertising money.
As people learn more about cryptocurrency, they quickly flee from such destructiveness.
Oh, and that they brigade here so often, spreading complete nonsense, and when they are called out for clarification, they so so quickly resort to outright shit slinging.  
So, please, tell us what hostile takeover project you approve of that /btc is promoting this week,
and be very specific about what you think is good about it, and why it actually belongs on a bitcoin forum.
(Classic, BU, &amp; co are actually altcoins btw)
@_date: 2016-01-18 22:47:19
People pushing to completely change it need to just go make another altcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:28:41
Wow, the mods here are incredibly tolerant.
So, so many baseless accusations of "CENCORSHIP!"
(and they 99.9% come from /btc and other corporate cesspools of disinformation).
I fully agree with that rule though.  Damn, if it was my sub, I'd straight up nuke and ban the blatant propaganda.
I suppose that sets a bad example?  heh,  donno what is worse actually.  So much abusive disinformation all over the internet (not just here) promoting blatant scams such as BU. 
Anyway, if you present your opinion in a reasonable level headed way, it won't be deleted here.
even if it is directly promoting such scams. :(  Please don't pretend as if decently put comments are deleted.
If you go WAY beyond all reason, then you damn well deserve your comment to be deleted,
but that is very rarely the case even then. This entire thread is a huge spamming attempt, OP is a complete shill, /btc is brigading this thread *hardcore*, but still, here we are.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:23:45
Unlimited trying to steal the Bitcoin name and blockchain in the first place just proves how untrustworthy they are.  This is not done in Open Source.
(let alone that their tiny "unlimited" dev team doesn't have a clue technology-wise)
The code is open, a specific project's resources belong to that project.
We've seen such get-rich-quick scams crash and burn many times before (lookin' at you, ClassicCoin).  They are to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
Miners can choose to hash out useless UnlimitedCoin if they wish,
destructively spamming up the Bitcoin blockchain with their garbage.
Legitimate Bitcoin nodes, exchanges and wallets will simply continue ignoring them.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:02:39
No, today we live in a completely different world than back then.
There was no way of envisioning the threat that massive centralized mining is today, 
nor the massive corporate funded propaganda campaigns pushed by scams like BU.
These threats are in no way what S referred to as your "server farms". 
He meant individual Bitcoin advocates, not greedy scams and government-funded attacks.
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:47:32
Almost makes more sense than him actually believing all the shit-slinging he's doing.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:39:09
It's about another hostile hijacking attempt by shady scammers.
BU has no integrity, technological merit, or legitimate philosophy.
And simply increasing block size would be very foolish.
"philosophy" cannot dictate the direction of Bitcoin, only solid, proven science.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:54:37
It's pretty damn obvious to anyone that's been around a while too. This and other legitimate cryptocurrency forums have seen disgusting levels of disinformation, propaganda and downright shit-slinging from scams such as XT, Classic, and now Unlimited.
Fortunately, they're getting pretty easy to spot.
@_date: 2017-03-03 22:52:48
lol..  You support bigger blocks, without regard for bitcoin's safety or longevity.
Have any of the yahoos over there on /btc informed you what a 51% attack is?

Actual knowledge is a wonderful shield against bullshit.
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:25:58

That site has zero to do with the Bitcoin project.
Zero cheek, just flat out reality.
your type is not welcome here, or any other legitimate cryptocurrency forum.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:26:12
Miners are not going to hash out useless blocks that nobody uses or passes along,
so reality is exactly the opposite of what you're trying to assert.
What's shitty is the huge mining concerns trying to hijack the network, and supporting scams like BU.
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:02:22
It actually amazes me that this scam artist Ver is even given a platform to spew his nonsense.  
He has zero plan or any real understanding of cryptocurrency, and makes this very obvious, constantly.
The best thing about him that anyone can really say is that he's a damn good salesman (with no real product).
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:58:42
Technically, BU is not taken seriously by anyone worth a damn. Not one little bit.
The social attack such scams as XT, Clasic, and now Unlimited are capable of is very clear though.
Fortunately, such corporate-sponsored propaganda is becoming very easy to spot.
It is heartening to see the majority of Bitcoin exchanges getting wise, as their recent release demonstrates.
UnlimitedCoin will be considered unworthy to trade 
unless it can provide solid evidence of protections against shady maneuvers
(which is impossible with their get-rich-quick scheme).
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:22:18
No, you yelling "CENSORSHIP!" like all the other scam and spammers that brigade here... says you are not, at all a neutral bystander.
There is no censorship here. And that this ridiculous thread still is here is proof of that.  
The lot of you need to get back to /btc where you belong.
@_date: 2017-03-23 01:41:21
Such lunacy as simply increasing max block size, with zero protections, is completely destructive lunacy. That would only encourage even more mining power centralization. :-(
The scam artists promoting such are not to be trusted. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:11:27
What we mean when we talk about "centralization" in cryptocurrency has to do with mining power, not software development.
It is a specific term in a specific context. 
Bitcoin is coded by poeple contributing to the bitcoin project.
Sleasy scam artists *calling* themselves "bitcoin" but having zero to do with the project itself is not "decentralization" even in the false way you're using it.
Though such get-rich-quick scam artists love to try to confuse the jargon in exactly the same way. :(
@_date: 2017-03-23 10:16:58
Actually, the largest and most vocal segment "supporting" this scam BU are paid shills. 
The entire sham is much more comparable to ShareBlue, CTR &amp; Co. than any kind of fantasy "community".  
People are really sick of scams like this spewing disinformation, propaganda and downright shit-slinging. We saw it with XT, Classic, and now UnlimitedCoin. 
And yes, the democrats lost with just such abusive measures.
@_date: 2016-01-28 15:01:16
"upgrade"... you mean completely abandon bitcoin for an altcoin that has aggressively stolen bitcoin's infrastructure.
@_date: 2016-01-23 12:20:55
This new "classic" takeover attempt is a perfect example of a push to control the network. 
By all rights it is an altcoin, but they are dangerously messing around with the bitcoin blockchain and infrastructure. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:52:52
stay far away from propaganda mills like /btc.
Also be aware they do brigade and spread their toxic propaganda here quite a bit.  
You'll hear actual facts about cryptocurrency here though. There are tons of very knowledgeable people posting in ths sub.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:27:19
They themselves say their "proprietary node" is not bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:15:02
Anyone with a shred of understanding about how cryptocurrency works, and has looked into the joke that is UnlimitedCoin, knows full well that there is nothing even slightly resembling "improvement" in it.
It is a hostile takeover / hijacking attempt, nothing more.
Also, it has nothing to do with Bitcoin, except that Bitcoin is the target of that hijacking attempt.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:35:54
Good luck finding anyone to offer you actual money for UnlimitedCoin, 
even IF their threatened attack ever went through.

@_date: 2017-03-19 22:29:20
bah!  the "drama" is yet another destructive get-rich-quick scam trying to hijack bitcoin.
We've had XT, Calssic, and now BU try this crap. Surely others before them. It is nothing new.
They only thing they have going for them is a large corporate-funded advertising budget to spread misinformation, trying to hype up some fantasy "debate" where there is none.
Nobody in their right mind is going to turn bitcoin development over to this tiny group of greedy yahoos, except other scam artists.
@_date: 2017-03-23 19:58:11
Very very good idea to learn about the tech behind cryptocurrency specifically and open source in general.
Part of that is knowing that, in the context of crypto, "decentralization" refers to mining power. It has nothing to do with software coding.
Bitcoin developers are, by definition, "centralized" on the Bitcoin open source project. Same with altcoins.
The *source* code is open to use, copy and fork, but a project's *resources* belong to that project alone.
Where things get nasty is scams like XT, Classic, and now BU trying to hijack another project's resources (name, and in this case blockchain). 
Such shady behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of open source.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:46:19
Who the hell is "we"?  
The ridiculous disinformation you're repeating here (that has been thoroughly debunked again and again) only make actual cryptocurrency advocates even more concerned.
Back to /btc with you. They like such blatant propaganda over there.
Legitimate cryptocurrency forums such as this one aren't buying the snake oil.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:35:43
Nothing.  Bitcoin would remain Bitcoin.
This incompatible BU nonsense would simply continue to be ignored by bona fide Bitcoin miners, nodes wallets and exchanges. 
Miners and exchanges dumb enough to insist on spamming the Bitcoin blockchian with that useless scam would lose their investment.
It's a rediculous idea, and the only ones promoting it are get-rich-quick scam artists with large corporate advertising budgets, pushing disinformation and propaganda.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:25:08
Crazy, willfully out to make a profit with blatant disinformation, and 
or duped by such disinformation.
There is absolutely zero technical merit in UnlimitedCoin.
Even if they had made a bona fide altcoin, nobody but other get-rich-quick scam artists would support it.
Thier technological ineptitude is just the start. Willfully spamming lies, disinformation and dwonright shit-slinging is their MO, just like other scams before them (hello XT, ClassicCoin &amp; Co.).
@_date: 2017-03-23 22:59:22
That makes absolutely zero sense.
What you are talking about are altcoins.  There are plenty of them.
They are not bitcoin though. There is only one Bitcoin project.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:00:19
Huge ammounts of corporate backing from interests that are clueless about actual cryptocurrency, or are directly against it.  We've seen this exact thing before.  XT, Classic, etc... and now Unlimited.
Completely incompatible with Bitcoin, zero claim to use that name, spamming another project's production blockchain with their bullshit...
zero worth technically, so they don't offer legitimate competition that a real altcoin would.
Instead they spam cryptocurrency forums with disinformation (hello /btc brigarders!) with corporate advertising money. Well, until their corporate backers finally realize that their minuscule, secretive "dev team" is full of shit.  (how many does Unlimited have, all of 4 or so?)
The only "good" thing that can be said about Roger Ver is that he's one hell of a salesman. :(
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:02:05

Yes, there are many bitcoin clients. Several are promoted directly by the bona fide bitcoin project.
Nodes though, there is only one I'm aware of.  Trusting just any 3rd party with such important software is risky.
Just look at the crap UnlimitedCoin is trying to push. 
These "implementations" can be potentially ok, but again, it's risky running such important software that doesn't have the large and knowledgeable bitcoin dev team behind it.
I wonder how many of the smaller ones on that graph are actually using fully compatible, bona fide bitcoin?
The ones that are not, have no business using the Bitcoin name whatsoever. They are altcoins.
Legitimate altcoins are a Good Thing. Hijacking the resources of another project (name, blockchain) and spamming incompatible garbage on the bitcoin blockchain is inexcusable.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:13:00

Very easy to spot too, so stop trying to make legitimate Bitcoin advocates look bad with outlandish gibberish, *claiming* to be pro-bitcoin.
UnlimitedCoin is nothing more than a hostile takeover attempt, and has nothing to do with Bitcoin, except their abuse aimed at it.  Same with that unwashed toilet /btc.

There is already consensus. There never was a real question about it. It is a complete non-issue.
The actual issue is that we cannot allow huge money players to control the blockchain. Increasing blocksize without proper, careful protections in place is extremely dangerous.
The people pushing some silly narrative about "consensus" being needed are working for a hostile takeover attempt of the blockchain by big money players.
This means the whole "Classic Coin" silliness. It never had a chance, and it is tiring having all this blatant disinformation thrown around trying to make it seem like a "thing".

Why would anyone bother.
BU's laughable "dev team" is all the destruction needed.
Nobody in their right mind (except other get-rich-quick scam artists) would dream of turning Bitcoin development over to those yahoos.
UnlimitedScam nodes going back online virtually simultaneously makes it extremely obvious they are being run by a centralized organization. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 20:45:34
Yes, I was stuck on the silly idea of currency "decentralization", which does not (or at least should not) exist on a blockchain.  Embarrassing.  I uhh... got confused for a second there.  :)
Of course mining decentralization is key. Too much mining power could give control of the blockchain to one party (or group). 
This is a HUGE concern and must be protected against.
The sort of "decentralization" I'm against is having various incompatible currencies on the blockchain. This is just clutter and nothing positive at all. 
You gave an excellent reply, and probably informed some people not so familiar with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:55:22
Err... the Bitcoin project, is just that, an open source project.  
It has a HUGE group of very knowledgeable developers.
Anyone can contribute.  This means submitting code to the open source project with a push request.
There is no "control" about it except for, as in any open source project, the full vetting of code for merit.
Scams like XT, Classic, and lately Unlimited, have offered no code to the bitcoin project.  
They have nothing to do with it whatsoever.
What they are doing is trying to hijack another project's resources, claim them for their own.
This kind of shady behavior is looked down on with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just cryptocurrency.
If UnlimitedCoin wanted to (or could) offer legitimate competition, they'd run a bona fide altcoin.  They don't, and it's been shown that they cannot.
Nobody is going to turn bitcoin development over to a miniscule dev team of secretive, shady scam artists.

err scaling is ok, but not at such extreme risk.
There is already a dangerous concentration (centralization) of mining power.  Look up what a 51% attack is.
Increasing max block size with no protections would encourage even more centralization.  Dicouraging the little guy miner, as well as full nodes to boot.
We have an answer ready to go. It works, it is tested and tried and true.  Only scam artists and greedy miners don't want it.
Segwit is the answer for actual bitcon stability and longevity.
Increasing blocksize willy-nilly is exactly the opposite.

A hostile takeover attempt of an already existing software is in no way beneficial.
What it is is an altcoin, it's just that some people don't want to do the work, so they're trying to steal it from an already established project.

The disreputable mining conglomerates trying to blackmail the Bitcoin project are not in any way to be trusted either.  
**The major benefit of cryptocurrency (including bitcoin)** is strong resistance to such centralized, corporate / government backed attacks. Destructive actors would like to turn Bitcoin into just another easily controlled fiat currency, or destroy it outright.

instead of trying to steal the resources of another project.
The tiny BU dev team cannot offer anything worthy though, as they've clearly shown.

They simply mine bitcoin because it has value, and are replaceable.
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:07:45
Your "understanding" how cryptocurrency works is completely irrelevant.   
BU is a huge scam, and they've proven it.  It has zero to do with bitcoin.
You're supporting turning bitcoin over to a tiny dev team that would make the entire project secret. 
The BU "development team" has shown, again and again, that they have no  bug control workflow whatsoever.  Neither do they have an actual working code base.
If they had anything, whatsoever, to offer, they's make a damn altcoin. That would be respectable, and welcome. 
They do not though, because they cannot.  Nobody would use their crappy coin, because it dose  not work the way they want.
What they DO have is a ton of corporate advertising money. :( 
Look up what a 51% attack actually is. when you understand that, you'll understand what Unlimited coin scam artists are all about.
There have been legitimate bitcoin mining pools that have come close to 50% mining power... they split into smaller groups, encouraged their members to move over to the new offshoots.
That was legitimate support for decentralization, something that is the base of cyrpocurrency's longevity and safety.
What Unlimitedcoin is promoting is all power to the already too powerful mining corporations that are already too close to that critical 50%, and have zero interest in splitting up, or in the actual benefit of any cryptocurrency. Let alone bitcoin.
Anyway, "Unlimited" has nothing to do with bitcoin to begin with. By all rights it is an altcoin. 
Forking an open source project like bitcoin is fully OK and encouraged. IF they came up with something better, people would use it.  
What is NOT ok in open sourse is to fork a project, and try to hijack / steal the resources of the parent project. (in this case, blockchain, and name)  Such shady behavior is looked down on with extreme prejudice in all of open source, for damn good reason.

Actually, it is allowed in vast amounts. The mods here are incredibly tolerant. This sub (and other legitimate crytocurrency forums around the internet) are constantly brigaded.  
Very little intelligent discussion comes from it.  The crapfest that is /btc allows no such thing.  Promoting blatant hijacking attempts as they do = sapm.  On many levels.
Disinformation. Direct abuse of Open Source best practices, and worst, a very willful desire to undermine the best cryptocurrency project out there.
There is only one bitcoin, and there are those that would seek to co-opt another project, steal it's resources,  or destroy it outright, 
(as so many have tried,  aka ClassicCoin, UnlimitedCoin, and Co)
Are discouraged with extreme prejudice in any open source community.  Their behavior is irredeemable. 
Not to mention that even IF they actually did make a bona fide altcoin (what classic, bu and others actually are) their rediculous schemes would  not be worth the trouble to even consider.
So,  here we are... them trying to fuck with bitcoin, yet again.
We're all rather tired of it, but it will probably continue as long as bitcoin is so successful. 
Thankfully, such snake oil salemen are easier and easier to spot.  We've seen so, so many of their type spam nonsense, and downright shit-slinging on serious forums, it's pretty easy to spot now.

Even that outdated phrase, "cash" does not mean less than a penny.  And even those are being done away with by many fiat systems. Micopayments are not even *possible* with "cash".  This is a ridiculous argument.
Small transactions were fully planned by Satoshi, as he paved the way for Level2 transactions in his code, and spoke of them in that very whitepaper.
No, micro-payments were never meant to be on blockchain. That would be absolutely ridiculous.  
Scam artists such as UnlimitedCoin and disreputable mining conglomerates, constantly spread such blatant disinformation (such as /nikize has repeated above), for their own greedy, destructive profit.
It is abundantly clear their motives have absolutely zero to do with either Satoshi's intention, 
nor the benefit of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:33:23

They are nothing but destructive to one of Bitcoin's greatest strengths: side skirting such destructive control.

As long as Bitcoin is popular, we'll have to deal with such shady hijacking attempts and get-rich-quick schemes.  Thankfully, we've seen so many of them lately (hello ClassicCoin) they're pretty easy to spot.
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:47:04

The mods here are almost tolerant to a fault to spam and propaganda from scams such as UnlimitedCoin.
Saying otherwise is just more of the same blatant propaganda, and easily debunked (as has been done again and again),
just like all the other disinformation spammed here supporting scams such as XT, Classic and now UnlimitedCoin. 
If anyone steps over the line soooo extremely  as to have a post deleted or actually get banned (highly unlikely) then they have nobody to blame but themselves. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 23:56:47
The way to do that is not just start spamming the blockchain with any and all incompatible currencies.  That is an absurd idea. Respectable alt coins have their own blockchain. This competition is healthy and good. If they are better than bitcoin, people will use them.
Trying to piggyback a project on top of anther's established infrastructure is shady as hell and is to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
Do not trust people talking about "decentralization" meaning cluttering up the bitcoin blockchain with incompatible currencies. This is blatant disinformation spread for their own political and monetary gain. Again, shady as hell.
The actual definition of decentralization in the context of cryptocurrency has to do with mining power, nothing else.

There is a huge downside to willy-nilly upping blocksize with no protections to the even further mining centralization that promotes.
SegWit is an intelligent answer. It has bigger blocks included already, without the downside.

There must be some protection from outside influences looking to ruin the thing that makes bitcoin so great. The propaganda campaign seen here, the hardcore abusive takeover attempts suggest anything but motivations for public good. 
Looks much more like someone wants to rake in huge profits by twisting bitcoin into something it was never meant to be. 
If the ideas this altcoin dev team have are good, then their altcoin will be successful, maybe supplanting bitcoin. There would be nothing wrong with that, but trying to take over an established project that is doing so much good is simply destructive, and delves their whole "clasic-coin" altcoin project under a dark cloud of shady motivations.

If miners insist on hashing out useless blocks, spamming up the Bitcoin blockchain with hostile trash like BU, 
They will simply be ignored, by nodes, other miners, exchanges and wallets,
and be replaced with miners that act with integrity.

@_date: 2017-03-20 01:12:37
You basically just described centralized banking. :(
No, that is in no way what cryptocurrency is, nor can be allowed to become.
@_date: 2016-03-24 12:19:38
Not attacking you at all man.  Just the message. 
No, this has zero to do with centralization... and there you go again.
What's the lesson we learned today kids?  Centralization, or decentralization, in the context of cryptocurrency, has to do exclusively with *mining power*.
Please stop using those words to describe something else. 
The bitcoin dev team is huge. Turning over the project to some tiny handful of dissenters that want to hard fork over to their own project would be disaster. 
Not gonna happen.  Please stop spreading this disinformation and ridiculous fantasy scenarios.
They are destructive to bitcoin and have as little place here as they have to do with reality.  None.
@_date: 2016-03-24 02:43:02
If classic coin is not using the bitcoin blockchain, produces incompatible currency... then what are they doing using the Bitcoin name?
It is my understanding that it is, actually, using the bitcoin blockchain. The incompatible currency just can't be used by any bitcoin client. :(
Colored coins is another very good example of a very bad idea that should be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
As far as the forums go, I'm talking about astroturfing, shilling, sock puppets, a propaganda campaign, spam.
This crap has been horrible the last months, and it is well beyond average background internet toxicity levels. It is also a waste of resources and destructive behavior that should be discouraged with extreme prejudice. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:34:14
Actions speak louder than words.  
UnlimitedCoin is nothing but yet another hostile hijacking attempt.
If they wanted any credibility, they'd start an altcoin (which is what UC is).  They can't, because nobody would use their cockamamie plan.
So, like the other scam artists before them, they resort to spending tons of money on disinformation and propaganda, trying to drum up some fantasy "issue" where there is none.
@_date: 2016-06-27 10:44:20
I already have.  
And again:  Larger block size increases the cost of mining. Therefore, it endangers mining becoming even more centralized. This is a Bad Thing. 
Also, other projects trying to hijack the bitcoin blockchain  (or any project trying to hijack another project's resources) is a Bad Thing.
It it to be looked down on with extreme prejudice. Shady as fuck.
Very simple. To say otherwise is supporting abusive behavior. 
And now, we've had plenty enough of this type of blatant spam here lately. It seems to me you'll find it much more friendly over at /btc.  
You see, here, people actually *support* bitcoin, actually know how it works, and look down on such ridiculous and abusive ideas.  Incompatible projects abusing the Bitcoin blockchain is a Bad Thing. Period.

It has been spammed here to no end these last months, and is very unwelcome.  go back to /btc with that crap.
@_date: 2016-06-26 21:13:59
Potentially, but at 51%+ it starts getting REALLY dangerous.
Anyway, that just strengthens the point.  Decentralization, 
a wide spreading of mining power, is very important.
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:22:41
SegWit is an increase in max block size.

(unlike so many other scams we've seen such as UnlimitedCoin).
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:57:37
Except there is no real "war" at all, nor even a legitimate "controversy".  Never was.
What there *is* though, is a lot of corporate advertising money being spent on blatant spam and disinformation from a long line of scam artists. 
(lookin' at you ClassicCoin, UnlimitedCoin &amp; Co., and their little army of /btc agents)
As long as bitcoin is popular, we'll have to deal with shady get-rich-quick schemes attempting hostile takeovers. Thankfully, they're pretty damn obvious for anyone that knows the first thing about cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 17:14:53

There is not going to be a hard fork to increase block size. 
It's a pipe dream by some tiny team of scam artists.
@_date: 2016-06-28 11:54:43
wtf are you on about now?  
Miners were not, ever, in control of blocksize bud, nor can that ever be allowed.
Segwit is an *optimization* of block size, not an increase.  Also, it's not actually Segwit itself, but other optimizations that come with it.


again, complete nonsense.  Indesriminately increasing block size with no protections in place is no answer.
The bitcoin dev team are working on any *legitimate* scaling issues, as has been discussed with you elsewhere to no end. There is NO doooom scenario as you are trying to suggest. 
Absolutely zero evidence for it in reality, anywhere. Only pure bullshit propaganda.
Please stop spewing such disinformation now. We've been debunking your absolute nonsense in this thread for hours.
We've tried to reason with you. You refuse. We've given you a chance to make a legitimate argument for your ridiculous claims. You have utterly failed to do so, and continue spamming disinformation.

@_date: 2016-06-28 10:46:54
lol..  dude, you cannot compare tiny altcoins to bitcoin,  yes, there we agree.
err.. mining is profitable, but it is not what bitcoin is about AT ALL.
The driving force is bitcoin's USEABLILITY.  If we allow shady miners to control blockchain size, soon some large player or other will have that crucial 51% concentration of mining power, and bitcoin dies.


false. better usage of blocks is in the works. This is the safe and sane variant until safegards are put in place against detrimental centralization.
The bitcoin dev team are working on any *legitimate* scaling problems. There is no DOOOOM scenario, regardless how much money is put into disinformation to the contrary.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2016-06-28 22:25:03

Now it's gone beyond spam into downright trolling.
We've tried to have an intelligent conversation with you, with these results, now just go away. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 11:27:14
lol  'progress' is the insane forcing of a hard-fork solely to increase block size.
This is completely rediculous.  It directly encourages even more centralization of mining power.  Directly encouraging that dangerous 51% concentration of mining power that would be bitcoin's end.
Anyone, miner, wallet devs, infrastructure people, anyone pushing for such a destructive block size increase, with NO protections in place against the centralization that would ensue, is to be taken seriously. Quite the contrary...
People supporting such ludicrously destructive ideas are working directly against the benefit of bitcoin in specific, and cryptocurrency in general. They are to be held in extreme distrust, with extreme bias.
If Classic Coin &amp; Co wanted anything else but contempt, they would have produced a real competing product, instead of spending so much money on blatant propaganda, wasting all our time. They belonged on their own blockchain. If their implementation was better, hell, I'd have used it too.  Nope, they went for a power grab. Trying to hijack Bitcoin's blockchain. Completely humiliated now, some are STILL trying, with threads like this.
Sorry boys, that ship sunk long ago.  Time to move on to the next get-rich-quick scheme.
Back to /btc with the lot of you.
@_date: 2016-06-28 21:03:31
It is very, very simple. AGAIN:
**Can LightningCoin transactions be used by [bona fide bitcoin clients?](
And again, the idea of keeping *tiny* transactions from being catalogued forever on the bitcoin blockchain is not a bad one,
 but doing it as some side-project trying to hijack bitcoin notoriety... I don't trust them one bit.
IF (big if) they had something worthy, with no detrimental strings attached,
it would have been offered in a legitimate push request to be vetted and accepted or rejected.
How they are doing their "business" looks shady as hell to me. 
I'll look into it more, but just the very way they go about things is not good.
@_date: 2016-06-27 23:41:07
If Classic Coin and other such get-rich-quick schemes wanted to earn an iota of respectability, they would have done just that: Use their own damn blockchain (and forums for that matter) and offer real competition. 
Instead, they have spent untold time and money on blatant disinformation and propaganda, trying to drum up some "issue" that never was there, and profit from it.
Trying to hijack a parent project's resources (bitcoin blockchain) is shady as hell, and the way they've gone about it is to be discouraged with extreme bias.
They never had a chance, and after seeing how much time and energy such shady projects have wasted, how detrimental it is to cryptocurrency in general, and bitcoin in particular, *actual* bitcoin enthusiasts are rather sick of this silliness.
So yes, take your altcoin to it's own blockchain.
@_date: 2016-06-26 21:03:08
Bittorrent is a completely different animal. Zero comparison,
and no, it is not "opinion".   It is simply how things work in cryptocurrency.  Please inform yourself a bit before believing the misinformation and propaganda spread by these fly-by-night upstarts.
Having umteen thousand implementations all on one blockchain is madness.  Shall we just invite every other altcoin to use the bitcoin blockchain? No, that's insane. 
There is no problem having alternatives, competition is GOOD!
What is bad is when a child project tries to hijack the resources of the parent project. One altcoin, one blockchain. That's how things work.
@_date: 2016-06-28 10:50:22
There is absolutely no DOOM. That is my point.  
Increasing blocksize indiscriminately is insane. It only encourages centralization. Allowing a crucial 51% centralization must be avoided at all costs. 
Again, there is no DOOM scenario. Nobody in their right mind supports turning over bitcoin development to a tiny dev team of dissenters that support this insanity of willy-nilly increasing block size with zero safeguards in place.
Also, we've had plenty enough of such blatant and aggressive disinformation tactics here supporting such silly ideas. Now, go back to /btc where you belong.
The bitcoin dev team are working on any *legitimate* concerns with scaling. There is currently zero need to increase block size. There will be no hard fork for that.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2016-06-27 23:22:36
Confirmations are in no way unreliable now.  Please stop with the blatant disinformation. 
To hear all the shills and scam artists (not to mention useful idiots that swallow their snake oil), you'd think bitcoin has ground to a standstill and people are leaving in droves.  ha, nothing could be farther from the truth.
It's absolutely ridiculous. There has been no significant change in confirmation "reliability",
and people are not "no longer using bitcoin" because of any such nonsense. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 07:14:30
We know that letting 51% (or above) mining power fall into the hands of one party (or conglomerate) is extremely dangerous.

@_date: 2016-06-28 09:51:01
Is "classic coin" compatable with bona fide bitcoin wallets or mining? NO. Therefore it belongs on its OWN blockchain (and forums for that matter).  If they had done that they might get some respect. 
Competition is good. They didn't ever want that. What they (and their financial backers) wanted was to hijack bitcoin. They failed miserably, and for very good reasons. 
They've shown themselves far too shady and greedy to trust, with all the blatant and abusive propaganda and astroturfing they spam.  That ship has sunk. Besides, as said before, nobody in their right mind is going to turn bitcoin development over to some tiny group of dissenters. 
Miners cannot ever be in control of block size. Of COURSE they want larger ones. It cuts out competition. This encourages even more mining centralization. This is an enormous threat for any cryptocurrency. The point you're making is only in favor of being VERY careful with increasing block size.
There is no real threat from "classic coin". it's a bunch of hot air with no substance behind it.  IF they ever had a chance to get their way, it would be disastrous for bitcoin. Not gonna happen.

Also, damn, I'm surprised anyone else made it to the end of this massively long thread. heh.
I suppose the vote count shows where you stand on the other issues being discussed here.
On that we won't agree. Mr. Trolls has the sane view and that other yahoo is just spamming more disinformation.
I'll look into lightning more, but really, I see no need for it. If they have something good, merge it into bitcoin, not piggyback it on top.  I don't trust the scenario at all.
@_date: 2016-06-27 23:31:34
There was serious hype and propaganda from fly by night, get rich quick scam artists, with massive funding for spam and shilling.
Classic coin never had a chance, despite all the advertising money they wasted trying to drum up some non-existent "issue".
This thread is just more of the same bullshit. I really wish it, and all such blatant spamming and disinformation attempts would just be locked on sight. 
We've had WAY too much of this crap lately, not just here, but on so many bitcoin forums. It's time to give it up.
@_date: 2016-06-26 07:26:10


Because increasing the blocksize would tend to centralize mining power even more.  I hope that was a typo.
Also, I am unaware of any one group or person that has anywhere near 51% of mining power. In fact, I have often read of mining pools that have gotten close voluntarily splitting into smaller groups.
What "handful of miners/pools" are you talking about?
@_date: 2016-06-28 22:31:27
We've had plenty enough of the snake oil.  Nobody is buying.
We've tried reason, we've tgried intelligent conversation, and still this crap...
Enough already.  
No, regular bitcoin wallets will have bitcoin.  Thank god, and all the dirty get-rich-quick schemes will fall by the wayside.
IF any of them actually contribute productively to the actual project, in a respectable manner, then those contributions will be merged.
OR, they need to get with the damn program and have their OWN project, like respectable altcoins do.

There is absolutely no logical argument for anything the anti-bit-coin faction spamming this crap has to say.
it's been going on WAY too long now. Again, it is a MASSIVE sign of the dev's fairness that this bullshit is tolerated.

You, anyone that has any interest in cryptocurrency (being the vast majority of readers in this forum), and I,  know...
One Altcoin : One Blockchain.  This is absolutely by design. Anything else is lunacy.
Maybe there are some experiments going on that would do otherwise, but all *serious* production level altcoins are, in fact, *designed* to have seperate blockchains.
*If you REALLY believe the opposite, as you've just written*, and are not just being paid to say it, *I strongly suggest you research what you're actually talking about*.   
Now, lurk and learn, or go back to /btc where you came from.

Letting "the biggest businesses" dictate bitcoin development is the exact OPPOSITE of wisdom. It is insanity.
Destructive agents are telling us these blatant lies. Anyone can look at the numbers. Bitcoin is growing. There is no DOOM scenario as they so desperately want us to believe, just more blatant propaganda. They ineffectually try to instill fear where none is needed, purely for their own greedy profit.
People know what's REALLY up here. The shills and useful idiots are only are wasting all our time, and their money.
Actual informed cryptocurrency enthusiasts are tired of these blatant lies.
**Catering to these so called "biggest businesses" (read, scam-artists) would negate everything bitcoin actually has to offer**. Why don't we just use fiat? The Biggest Businesses already completely control that!

@_date: 2016-06-27 12:00:05
what the hell?  "identity politics"? Please.
Raising the blocksize without very secure protections in place, or none at all, as so many spammers and, unforgettably, useful idiots that buy into the propaganda, are so gung-ho for, is a Bad Idea.
We have had an intelligent discussion. You tried to say something that is completely contrary to reality (that raising the blocksize is no problem, or even produces (somehow, magically?) decentralization of mining power. 
It was pointed out to you that this idea is completely silly, and opposite of what the effect will actually be. This has zero to do with anything other than the dynamics of cryptocurrency.
Oh, and here we go again, "no central authority"... I'm sorry, there is  a very large group of very knowledgeable people that have been developing bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general that are, indeed, authoritative. Knowledgeable people learn from them instead of spewing nonsense. I suggest you do the same now.
Again, if someone codes something much better, submits it, it is accepted. As is with open source.
Letting any and all altcoin prjects, incompatible with the mother project, try to hijack the mother projects resources (blockchain in this case) is nothign more than abusive, and is to be *strongly* discouraged.
Also, any encouragement and disinformation supporting such abuse is to be corrected. If the parties insisting on spreading such harmful disinformation refuse to desist, in the face of authoritative knowledge, then they can easily be seen as spam, and it is fully OK to treat them as such.
Rich people may invest, yes. Where the problem lies is when they invest in shilling, astroturfing, spamming disinformation, in support of projects directly against the mother project, for thier own greedy profit. This has been a huge problem on legitimate bitcoin forums for a while now. 
Please stop.
@_date: 2016-06-26 09:43:09


No, there has been no huge increase at all, just a ton of very obvious propaganda to make it seem like it. More silliness from a few shady projects that have been spamming this, and other legitimate bitcoin forums lately.
Transactions have always gotten stuck sometimes. There is no real evidence that this has increased at all as much as the propaganda suggests.


Interesting err.. "theory".  Again, zero support for it in reality. 
Note the illogical use of "artificial" above. There are damn good reasons for limiting blocksize, else it would have been increased years ago. Sounds like someone has been hanging out on /btc a bit much? Probably better to go back.
People here, actual bitcoin and cryptocurrency enthusiasts, actually know what's up.

@_date: 2016-06-26 21:29:52
Yes, there is a huge difference.  All bittorrent clients can use the same torrents. They are compatible.
We are talking about different INCOMPATIBLE projects trying to piggyback on Bitcoin's blockchain, for their own greedy benefit,
instead of building their own infrastructure themselves, as is only right and respectable.
oh god, please go away with your "consensus" gobbldygook.  There is consensus, there never was a question, at all about consensus.
Someone has been hanging out on /btc too much. 
If someone has an implementation, a client, that is INCOMPATIBLE with normal, bona fide bitcoin clients, then it is an altcoin and belongs NOWHERE NEAR the bitcoin blockchain.
This is a very simple thing to understand.

Sorry bud, "what I've seen" is obviously from the likes of /btc. Not to be taken seriously whatsoever. Blatant spam, disinformation and propaganda are not reasons to do anything with bitcoin.
There never was any question of "consensus". Nobody is going to turn over development to some tiny development team of dissenters.
Also, increasing the block size willy nilly would be insanely detrimental to bitcoin's future. Ain't gonna happen.
What the community actually wants is a safe and sane way to improve the project. This, the bitcoin devs are doing very well.
Whoever you've been asking doesn't count one bit. What actual bitcoin users are *doing* is what matters. Miners, wallet writers, all manner of people actually involved in actual bitcoin business are in support of the dev team.
No amount of ridiculous propaganda will change that. It's time to give it up.
@_date: 2016-06-26 21:18:14
Who is telling you this nonsense?
Gaining a controlling percentage of mining power is VERY MUCH a real threat. Very possible, and has come close to happening several times.
Who is "limiting bitcoin's value"?  nobody, so that's irrelevant.
What the point here is, is that increasing the blocksize willy nilly directly benefits large mining farms, and disadvantages the Average Joe.  This will lead to more centralization of mining power.
This must be avoided.
@_date: 2016-06-27 13:23:41
Lightning network is just another scam.  They are by all rights an altcoin, belong on their own blockchain, and have no business being associated with bitcoin whatsoever.
Any hard forks in the past have been done through the large and very knowledgeable bitcoin dev team. 
A FAR cry from some tiny upstart of dissenting devs spreading disinformation for their own profit.


Yes, there we agree. And the way they operate, spamming legitimate bitcoin forums (not just here) with abuse, disinformation and propaganda is despicable. 
Again, increasing the block size willy nilly without VERY careful consideration and bulletproof protections in place is insane.
On a side note, I do not support SegWit. Any attempt to further de-anonymize bitcoin transactions is completely counter-productive in my opinion.  If we go down that road, there is a good chance powerful players (governments , and the banks controlling them) will require full disclosure. This is also a Bad Thing.
This is something to be hashed out in the dev team that is.  Starting some seat of the pants team and trying to take over all of bitcoin is ridiculous and destructive.
Anyway, 
IF any of these dissenting, money-grubbing, abusive altcoin teams actually have any legitimate concerns, the actual bitcoin dev team is *already* working on them. Mind you, without the risk of turning over development to such reckless,  yahoos. To try to forcefully take over the bitcoin infrastructure as so many of them are, is detrimental to cryptocurrency tech in general, and bitcoin very specifically.
If they were to act with an iota of responsibility and respectability, they would implement their ideas on it's OWN damn blockchain, and forums for that matter. That would be a very good thing. Competition is good. If they had a better product, hell, I'd use it.
What they are trying to do though, spreading lies: i.e. that massively increasing the blockchain, with no safegards against further centralization of mining power that would encourage, is despicable and completely dishonest. Shady as fuck and aimed to profit none but them and their financial backers.
There are things bitcoin can do better, but no, letting altcoins use the bitcoin infrastructure is not one of them.

Destructively trying to hijack the resources (name, blockchain, etc,) of an already established project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.

"free discount" my ass.  It's the price of growth, as it always has been.
Why would miners agree to that?  For the benefit of Bitcoin, that's why.
Miners cannot be allowed to control block size. There must be very strong controls put in place to ensure that a crucial 51% centralization never happens.
Respectable miners agree. Mining pools with integrity have split themselves into smaller agencies volentarily when they approached 50% mining centralization.
Mining concerns pushing to willy-nilly increase block size, with no safeguards in place, are not to be trusted. Neither is anyone supporting forcing something so detrimental to bitcoin. Very bluntly, shady as fuck,
and legitimate bitcoin enthusiasts are rather tired of this silly game. Miners included.
There will be no hard fork to only increase block size. The idea itself is completely insane.
Any *legitimate* issues with scaling, the bitcoin dev team is dealing with very well. Safely, sanely, carefully.
@_date: 2016-06-27 03:41:09
I'm sorry, but what you're saying makes no real-word sense whatsoever.
Bitcoin is not litecoin,  and yes, block size does have a large impact on the ease of mining. Bigger means an advantage for bigger miners with deeper pockets.
How could you possibly say exactly the opposite? 
Larger blocks do not mean higher usage. Usage will stay the same, slowly growing. The devs are working on ways to deal with this steady growth. 
Just willy nilly increasing block size will lead to disaster.
Larger blocks will help miners outside of china?  How?

AKA, not bitcoin.  Piggybacking on top of bitcoin's popularity.
BAD, all bad.
If anything good was in LightningCoin, it would be implemented into bitcoin, 
OR they'd do the respectable thing and use their own damn blockchain to create real competition.
I think the entire scenario stinks.  
Bitcoin could use some type of off-chain transactions so we don't need to store .005btc stuff.. maybe even bigger, on the blockchain,
BUT, it needs to be accepted by the bitcoin project itself, not just piggybacked on top by some external get-rich-quick, fly-by-night scam artists.

What MINERS are saying?  no, no no,  you mean what HUGE mining conglomerates with very deep pockets are saying.
Of COURSE they want larger block size. Makes their life easier, decreases competition, increases centralization.
This also is a HUGE threat to bitcoin.  Miners in favor of willy-nilly increasing blocksize (for their own profit) are not to be trusted.
True supporters of bitcoin, mining pools that have approached the crucial 51% mining power, have done the Right Thing, they voluntarily split into smaller groups to avoid such a huge threat.
Those are the miners we need to listen to. And really, no miners should be allowed to unduly influence block size. That way lies the downfall of bitcoin.
There are enough large players out there that would love to control, or destroy bitcoin. Letting any of them gain 50% or more mining power would be disastrous.
The devs are dealing very well with any *legitimate* issues on scaling, and safely, sanely. Bitcoin is doing just fine.

In no way, shape or form is such a rediculous block size increase in any way good.
It will do nothing more than give already-too-large mining concerns complete control, pushing any smaller players right off the map.
It has nothing to do with HDD size, it has everything to do with bandwidth.
Please learn the first thing about Crypto, especially Bitcoin before coming into a legit Crypto forum spewing baseless assertions as if you knew what you were talking about.
Even if you don't care about everyone having the bandwidth nessicary, what you SHOULD care about is that the higher bandwidth requirements are only a benefit to already-to-large mining outfits, and will push smaller ones off the map.
This leads directly to even more mining power centralization. The LAST thing that Bitcoin (or any similar altcoin) wants!

Right, the absolute limit is 1MB. as your link fully confirms.
Of course huge mining conglomerates are in favor of fully using that limit. 
Those with deep pockets only profit from larger block sizes.
Now, back to the *actual question*:
You think miners should dictate an increase past 1mb?
THAT is the question.  Obviously you do, and from the spam you've spewed here, it's very obvious why.
They should not, that's my point. The vast majority of respectable miners, those with integrity and an interest in what is best for bitcoin, agree. A simple blocksize increase with no protections is a Bad Thing. 
Do you see, at all, the danger in letting miners dictate such an increase? 
Do you see any need for protections against the further centralization of mining power that would encourage?
If not, you have not yet fully understood the dynamics invovled.
Or maybe you have, and are only trying to confuse people less knowledgeable, for some profit of your own. 
There is a huge risk in increasing block size with zero protections in place to ensure against further centralization of mining power. 
Those spreading disinformation on the contrary are not to be trusted whatsoever.
@_date: 2016-06-27 23:19:13
What an enormous waste of time and energy.
Increasing the block size willy nilly like that is insane. There need to be very solid protections in place. What the devs have planned, optimization instead of blindly and disasterously increasing block size alone, is absolutely the way to go.

Legitimate altcoin projects use their own name, and blockchain. Bcach (BCH), and so many previous scams by unscrupulous bad actors such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, are using the hard earned name and network of an already established project (Bitcoin).

The (HUGE) benefit of running a full node is that you can confirm your own transactions, not depend on anyone else to.
This use to be the norm. Now the blockchain has gotten so large, and so expensive to run in bandwidth, that "lite" wallets have become popular. 
Anyone seriously though, runs their own node, so shady characters (hi Jihan) don't have a chance of pulling shenanigans.
I have heard that you can run a trimmed node for about 2GB / month bandwidth.  This is a very conservative estimate.
Considering that upstream is usually MUCH slower than downstream, and Bitcoin requires both, it makes the problem even worse.
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:07:32
The Bitcoin project is run by Bitcoin project devs.  They don't own the source code, that is free for anyone to use.
The name, blockchain, and other resources belong to the Bitcoin project though. This is how Open Source works.
Such coding projects progress and improve. Saying it isn't still Bticoin because it is improving is completely absurd.
If someone doesn't like it, real competition is fully encouraged, and as said, the source code is there for anyone to use.  If your coin is better, people would use it.
Just use your own name, and use your own blockchain. Those belong solely to Bitcoin. 
Trying to steal the resources of a parent project just proves you're completely untrustworthy.

A very shady mining conglomerate wants an increase in blocksize, purely for profit.  Completely UN-respectable and fully lacking in integrity.

Nowadays, that the Bitcoin blockchian has gotten so heavy to deal with, we see all kinds of "lite" wallets, yes.
This is NOT a good thing!  :(
It use to be absolutely standard to run a full node along with a wallet, and is still VERY MUCH recommended, especially for any sizeable transfers.
You're just emphasizing my point. If anything, the max block size of 1MB is already too large.
willy nilly increasing it is the last thing we need. 
It would also promote even more mining power centralization,  an even larger threat. 
You are arguing for the destruction of what makes Bitcoin so powerful, its decentralized nature.
Indescrimately increasing block size would make it so only VERY LARGE players  could mine, or even run full nodes, putting all of us at the mercy of a few powerful players.

"Development decentralization" has no meaning in the context of cryptocurrency. 
Decentralization applies to mining, and mining alone in this context.
If someone wants to add to the bitcoin project, they simply need to code something better than what we have now, and offer it to be implemented. That is the the way open source works. 
How cryptocurrency does NOT work, is for multiple dev teams to be fighting over usage of the same blockchain. Each altcoin must have its own.

Classic coin is an altcoin startup with a tiny group of devs, with massive financial backing, that they use mostly to spam respectable bitcoin forums with disinformation, in an attempt to spread confusion. They do this purely for profit. It is nothing more than a hostile takeover attempt of bitcoin resources, with corporate backing from large players.
There was never a question of them gaining control of Bitcoin as they want, regardless of the lies their propaganda agents spam all over bitcoin forums.  We've all rather tired of their abusive silliness here.
Such disinformation a lot like you're trying to spread. I won't call it blatant lies in your case, but you do have a lot to learn about how cryptocurrency works.

Considering all the support for Jihan's BCH scam you're spewing all throughout this thread here, in the guise of "please let's be equal", it's pretty obvious why this post was created.  nothing
We've seen this crap before all too often. If, by some miracle of coincidence you're not from /btc and just blatantly promoting Jihan's latest scam, as they do, it would be *very* difficult to tell the difference.
The only vitriol comes from Jihan, Ver, and their paid brigades supporting scams such as XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, and now BCH.  Nothing they and thier goons have offered has any *substance*. Quite the opposite.
The Bitcoin community has been extremely patient, the mods here almost to a fault, and I can't imagine how the Bitcoin devs haven't straight up axed such nonsense with a POW change by now, not to mention the disdain Jihan &amp; co have earned from legitimate Bitcoin miners!
No bother, SegWit will activate soon, and all Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's plans can be safely ignored for a bit.  Such destructive takeover attempts though, will never be forgotten.
No, the subreddits are in no way comparable. /bitcoin supports Bitcoin.  /btc supports shady takeover attempts.
Don't come to a legit crypto forum spewing anti-bitcoin, anti-open source propaganda and expect a warm welcome. :(
Legit programmer or not, someone with any clue about Open Source, let  alone Cryptocurrency, would not be making such ridiculous assertions, as if they knew the first thing what  they were talking about.

This is a very bad thing, and it is not natural, whatsoever, for anyone that actually supports Bitcoin.
Legitimate mining concerns have historically split up, encouraged miners to form smaller groups, when getting anywhere NEAR the deadly 51%.
Jihan has been doing nothing but the opposite. :(
Fortunately his and the mining concerns under his control (only seller of his hardware) haven't reached 51%, not near it, else Bitcoin wouldn't exist, and we'd have nothing to talk about.
This threat must be garded against at all costs, which is why such shady behavior from Jihan, Ver &amp; Co has eaned them so much disdain in the Open Source, Crypto and Bitcoin communities.

It is nothing more than the latest in a long line of hostile takeover attempts from Jihan, Ver &amp; Co:  XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, x2, now BCH.

There is no fighting in the Bitcoin community. The disinformation about a some kind of "debate" is completely bogus. There never has been a "split" in the community.
The Bitcoin community, Bitcoin devs and legit mining concerns, have been behind SegWit all along.
The problem has been bad actors such as Jihan and the unscrupulous miners under his control and snake oil salesmen like Ver. They are the problem that held Bitcoin back from safe and sane scaling strategies so long.

You're absolutely right Mr. Hodler. Miners with actual integrity, that actually support bitcoin and cryptocurrency, are against anything encouraging that oh so dangerous 51% centralization of mining power.
Segwit might have some problems to iron out, (I strongly disapprove of any anti-anonymizing efforts)  but the other optimizations that come with it are so much better than a ludicrous, naked increase in block size it isn't even funny.
We have smarter miners. Miners with actual integrity, they are the VAST majority, in reality. They have since long seen through this redicouls DOOM straw man fallacy that Classic Coin &amp; Co have been spamming so hard.
The blatant spam and propaganda being spread in this thread ( and on so many other bitcoin forums) by the likes of Mr. Day &amp; Co there are nothing but the last dying tremors of a long dead scam.
These fools have failed to realize their misinformation is falling on educated ears now.

Very very bad things can happen when a majority of mining power is controlled by one entity. This is why decentralization is so important.
It would not take having to register with a single entity to mine, just for mining to become so expensive that it is only profitable for a select few.

What they want is another centrally controlled payment method. We already have credit cards, paypal etc... no thanks. 
Indiscriminately increasing max block size is extremely dangerous, leading to even *further* mining power centralization, which is why such bad actors (and their supporters) are looked down on so harshly.

There is no comparison. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:30:40
There is no "the" blockchain. There is a Bitcoin blockchain, Litecoin blockchain, etc... each to its own project.
Each legitimate altcoin also has its own name. Such as the Bitcoin project, for example. 
Trying to steal that name, and abuse its blockchain, is inexcusably shady business.
The "gatekeeper" of any Open Source project is the actual project itself. Not hard to understand.
The blockchain of any altcoin similar to Bitcoin is for one reason, for that altcoin.  That is its only legitimate use.
Want something like it, make your own.  The source code is free for anyone to use in their own project.
The resources are not.
If anyone tries to steal your project's name, blockchain, or any other resource belonging to the project, they would be equally discredited as illegitimate and destructive by Open Source and Crypto communities, not to mention legitimate business that use them.
Scams such as the likes of Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's:  XT, btc1, Classic, x2, Unlimited, BCH, and any other abusing another Open Source project for their own selfish gain, are

Attempting to hijack the resources of another project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
Bcash has no claim to the name Bitcoin, or its blockchain, let alone the reputation and network that it has built up over the years.
Legitimate altcoins do not try to cash in on the hard work of others like this. They use their own name and Blockchain. Only then can they offer legitimate competition. Bcash is in no way legitimate, let alone trustworthy.
Again, this is true for any Open Source project. 
On BCH specifically, it is nothing more than a power grab. Not just unscrupulous because of the hijacking attempts, but it well known that indiscriminately increasing max block size leads to further mining power centralization.
We already have credit cards, paypal, etc. The last thing anyone needs is yet another centrally controlled payment method, which is exactly what Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have so desperately tried to turn Bitcoin into with previous takeover attempts, and now are trying to create with this latest BCH scam.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:51:13
There is one Bitcoin project.
The source code is open to use for another project, but the resources of the parent project belong solely to it, this includes name, and in this case blockchain. 
The type of hostile behavior Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. are guilty of is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just crypto.
If they had the skill or any shred of integrity, they'd offer actual competition with a legitimate altcoin project. Own name, own blockchain. That would be respectable.

We've had all too much of this abuse here, and on other legitimate crypto forums all over the web.
Ironically, this only solidifies the disdain and mistrust that destructive snake oil salesmen such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. have earned in Open Source, Crypto and Bitcoin communities. 
Please, Mr. Cock, take your own advice.  I hear /btc is just the place to spew baseless disinformation (i.e. 8mb blocks = any type of answer) A large amount of such anti-crypto anti bitcoin lies actually stem from there, a known rally point for [Ver &amp; Co.'s paid shilling]( that spread such propaganda.  You'll feel right at home.
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:30:00
No, the blockchain, as well as the name Bitcoin belong to the Open Source project Bitcoin.  It has one name, one project, and many, many knowledgable devs.
The jargon "public" has zero meaning in the context of Open Source. You're thinking of publicly traded stocks.
Please learn the first thing about Open Source before you come into a legit Crypto forum making silly assertions. 
The source code is free for anyone to use and modify, for their *own project*. You can also submit code to the original project. This is legit competition and fully condoned. Jihan's tiny "dev" team has never even *tried* to contribute to the Bitcoin project.  They have zero claim to using that name and reputation. Done nothing to earn it whatsoever, quite the contrary.
The resources of an individual Open Source project belong to it alone.  Just as whatever name, blockchian, network, reputation and any other resources *your project* builds, also *belong to that child project alone.*
**This is how Open Source works. You cannot just go trying to steal another project's resources and expect to be seen with anything but contempt and disdain.**
Obviously, Jihan, Ver and their goons have no interest in integrity or credibility, as this is what they've been doing all along. Even if they had the slightest interest in making a legitimate altcoin, they've proven again and again they are not capable of it.  No dev worth anything would work for them. They only have a tiny handful of incompetents. The disreputable actions of that "dev" team are as bad as the snake oil salesmen Jihan &amp; Ver's.
Again, the source code is open to use,  the resources (including blockchain) belong to each project individually.

The *true* value of BCH is $0.  
A flatline of 0 is also stable though, which is where BCH is headed.

Bandwidth.  Full nodes are already hard to run for the average consumer, where this use to be the norm.
Now it's gotten so slow to d-load, and keep updating, the blockchain, "lite" wallets have become popular.
This means you're trusting other nodes to verify your transactions for you, instead of doing it yourself. :(  This is not recommended for any kind of large sum transfer at all.
Too easy for shady characters (hi Jihn) to pull shenanigans.
And then there is mining power... once a mining outfit finds a block, there is a race to get the next one in the chain.  The more bandwidth you have, the easier it is to win that race and propagate the next block.
Larger blocks put huge (already too large!) mining outfits at an advantage, which is why Jihan and his goons push their "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda so hard. :/
With SegWit all ready to go, there is no longer any legitimate reason, but an attempt to control Bitcoin, to even talk about block size.  If, one day, after SegWit and other safe and sane scaling measures are exhausted, *then* it might happen. That would be a long way off, if at all.
While you're at it, look up what a deadly thing a 51% attack is.  Basically the death knell for a cryptocurrency.

It is not fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:09:29
Willy-nilly increasing block size (as Jihan has so aggressively pushed so long) is dangerous. The LAST thing Bitcoin needs is for unscrupulous mining concerns to gain even more mining power concentration.
First SegWit, and the other safe scaling measures it opens the door for. Until they are fully explored, there is absolutely no need to talk about block size.

Neither of these get rich quick hijacking schemes are technically worthy.

That is what BCH REALLY is.

eh, there aren't THAT many that took advantage.
Ones that did had to risk dealing with shady exchanges, risking the BTC in exchange wallets to get the BCH out. Could have easily lost the BTC they used too.
The VAST majority just ignored that whole scam. As they will with Jihan's next x2 silliness.
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:25:24
The vast majority of legitimate exchanges already stated very clearly that they won't deal with something like BCH unless it can guarantee playback protection, which they can't.
The code can't even be considered in alpha, has had no testing, and being pushed into a production environment.  Typical of the handful of incompetent devs that Jihan has working for him.
We saw this with him and Ver's last scam, Unlimited.  
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:04:42
The source code is free for anyone to use in their own project.
The resources of each project belong to it alone. That is how Open Source works.
Trying to steal another project's resources, such as name, and in this case blockchain, is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Cryptocurrency. 
There are plenty of legitimate altcoins. True competition is a good thing and fully encouraged.

There is absolutely no reason for a block size increase until SegWit and the other safe and sane scaling measures it allows are fully explored.
Why do you think that this "Big Blocks NOW!" scheme is in any way a good thing? It would only promote even more mining power centralization.
No, IF a block size (or with SegWit, weight adjustment) is needed, it will happen. Slowly, safely, with protections in place against Bad Actors such as Jihan, Ver and Co that are pushing such big block propaganda for their own selfish gain.

Zero value.  None whatsoever. 
It is even risky "selling" the useless crap BCH for whatever you can get for it.
Count yourself lucky that you cashed in on that opportunity early, **IF you can get that value out.**
I'd strongly suggest you get your Bitcoin out of any shady exchange that deals in Jihan's latest scam asap!
Oh wait, you cannot.  They are not honoring the scamcoin until 20 blocks.  whoops!
You can't deposit any for exchange, only risk bona fide Bitcoin for the "split".  This is all vaporware.
At the end of this fiasco, **Better hope you can get out the original bitcoin they told you you could split!**  
Highly unlikely.  Lots of people are going to get robbed.

No, Satoshi would have been dead against stealing the resources of another project for greedy personal gain.
IF Jihan &amp; Co were to offer legitimate competition, with a bona fide altcoin, (own name, own blockchain), that would be enocuraged wholeheartedly.
They have neither the interest, nor the capability of doing such, only in consistently attacking Bitcoin and other legit projects.
We've seen so many destructive, aggressive takeover attempts, it's not even funny. XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, x2, now BCH.

Just as Litecoin belongs to the Litecoin project, right on down to jokes like Dodgecoin... all alt coins.  
Unless they are *specifically designed* to allow all manner of *incompatible* transactions on their blockchain (which makes zero sense, really) to each altcoin project, its own blockchain.
This is how cryptocurrency works, friends. Don't let anyone tell you different.
How open source software works is, you can freely fork a parent project, modify it to no end.  Even offer the changes back to the parent project. If they are worthy, they are accepted.
How it does NOT work is forking a child project, and agressivly trying to hijack the resourses of the parent project.

It has no value of its own. Quite the opposite.

The code being copied and altered is no problem, that is what Open Source is about.
What a HUGE no-no in Open Source is, is the hijacking of the original project's resources. Name for example, also blockchain in this case. 
That is what makes Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's schemes hijacking attempts.
"scarcity" has nothing to do with a hostile takeover attempt.

@_date: 2016-11-28 02:54:33

They and their supporters are the untrustworthy bad actors that were blocking bitcoin progress.
After SegWit is locked in irreversibly, their former schemes can be safely ignored, but not forgotten.
Fortunately, such hijacking maneuvers are easier and easier to spot and protect against.

There is no "scaling debate" that simply increasing max block size solves.  Quite the contrary.  Increasing it with zero protections is insanity.
Never was gonna happen. Never was gonna be a hard fork or any such silliness simply for that.  
There have been no reasonable, sane arguments for such, only get-rich-quick scam artists trying to hype up some fantasy "debate" or "consensus" nonsense.
Careful, efficient use of block size is the solution. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 20:54:40

The "debate" is just a bunch of advertising money spent on propaganda and hype by get-rich-quick artists promoting vaporware.

No reason for any legitimate exchange to even touch this latest scam.
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:59:20
Then the price is going to BOOM...  Worst time to spend.
Eventually it will reach a somewhat stable plateau (around the vicinity of the moon, I hear),
then spending / trading it will become attractive.
Adoption is pretty irrelevant when you can trade it for fiat.

Again, using the source code for your own project is fully encouraged. Trying to steal the resources of the parent project is discouraged with extreme prejudice, not only in Crypto, but all of Open Source.
Resources of an individual project include name and in this case, blockchain. 
Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's constant attempts to steal the parent project's (Bitcoin Project) resources is shady as hell. There is absolutely no apology for it. 
So many come in here thinking it's all fair game without the slightest understanding of what Open Source actually means,  especially when they get here from cesspools of disinformation like /btc, that support such abusive hijacking attempts. :(

Why don't you just go ahead and admit what your real motives are?
What you said you were saying is not what you were saying. Actually impossible to tell what you were actually saying, and you have not cleared that up one bit.
If you refuse to clear up the point (and I did give you opportunity, and now again), then don't be surprised if people assume the worst.

@_date: 2016-11-24 10:39:38

Seems like you don't wanna do that though, so we'll leave it at that.
@_date: 2016-11-28 04:42:31
no, not at all.  It is already a protocol, that any open source project is free to use, for their OWN project.
That includes *gasp* using their own name, and blockchain!
aka an altcoin.  This already happens every day.
So, you and the people you support want to be taken seriously, get to it!  the source code is out there.
We know someone knows how to program. If they put half their energy into something useful like *actual* competition for bitcoin, instead of aggressively trying to hijack another project's resources, they might have something worthy by now.
But no, nothing is coming of it, because it is pretty obvious none of the scammers are really interested in cryptocurrency, or its users, just their own greedy profits.
"small number of developers"  lol..  Bitcoin has a very large and knowledgeable crew of developers.

Ain't gonna happen bub.  Bye now.
@_date: 2016-12-09 06:49:40
For what possible reason?
There is none. The more effecient use of blocks SegWit brings with it is an infinitely better idea than willy-nilly increasing block size.
There will be no hard fork just to increase max block size. Never was even a question of it.

@_date: 2017-01-31 08:05:22
insurance on a bitcoin wallet?  Are you serious?
Who would you trust to insure it when your very government is not to be trusted? 
Bitcoin will not replace fiat, nor is it meant to.  It is very good at anonymously transferring funds. Any move to threaten that vital feature is a threat to bitcoin itself.
There are other ways to move money with "insurance". You need to trust the insurer, and the banks that are transferring it, and also the governments where those banks are located.
Bitcoin (and most cryptocurrency ) sidesteps all those risks.  The insurance is the blockchain.  Unless you do something very stupid, it is impossible for anyone to "steal" your coins.
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:20:40
Don't see any reason why a legitimate exchange would even consider dealing with Jihan's latest BCH scam.
IF you find one that will offer anything of value for it, take advantage immediately, it won't last long.
@_date: 2017-08-07 09:03:59
This is a ridiculous idea.  Much better to invest that money on your OWN full node. Trusting some 3rd party, non-profit or not, is just asking for trouble. You're arguing *for* centralization.
And, of course, this is why indiscriminately increasing max block size is so dangerous.
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:29:26
To everyone else that knows the first thing about Open Source, Cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin,
Bitcoin is an Open Source Cryptocurrency project of which there there is only one.
Trying to pretend hostile takeover attempts have any legitimacy are not only false, they are abusive to the ideals Open Source and Bitcoin are built on (AKA: anti-Bitcoin).
 It is not just I that assert so, but as said, the entire Industry and Communities that produce and support such projects.

Mining power has already been dangerously centralized. The Chinese government could theoretically take over and combine several of the huge mining outfits there to produce a deadly 51% attack.
Yes, this threat is dangerous enough. We need more decentralization.
Bigger max block size benefits (already too) large mining outfits, to the detriment of the average Joe. It can be argued that 1mb is already too large.
There have been mining pools that, when approaching 51% mining power, have voluntarily split into smaller groups. This is how it should be done and shows integrity. It also shows how very, very serious that crucial 51% is.
We cannot though, depend on the integrity of powerful players for the longevity and health of bitcoin (or cryptocurrency in general). There are too many powerful players that would love to destroy bitcoin.
We must encourage large amounts of small mining outfits and individuals running full nodes. Just instantly increasing max block size with no protections against further centralization only benefits the huge mining outfits,
not to mention makes it easier for destructive players (banks, governments, etc) to attack bitcoin.

Nonsense.  The mods here are extremely tolerant, almost to a fault.
You have to cross WAY over the line, blatantly breaking sub rules to deserve a comment to be deleted.
We see so many disinformation and propaganda brigades from supporters and paid shills of Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.  Their comments are allowed.
Personally, I consider deleting spam, and banning destructive spammers supporting such scams is good moderation. The Mods here though, as said, are extremely tolerant in the name of transparency and good will.
Trying to assert that there is any censorship here is just more propaganda and disinformation. Nothing could be further from the truth.
@_date: 2016-11-14 23:02:40
With Segwit, there is ZERO REASON to increase block size as you are asserting.  There never was.
Simply increasing block size with zero protections against the catastrophe that would encourage is insane.
@_date: 2016-11-28 03:12:16


Stop right there. 
This *is* a huge problem, and until you understand it better, there's not much else to say.
There have been large mining pools that approached that very dangerous 51%, and showing their integrity, they split up into smaller groups.
If there was no danger, why, oh why would they DO that?
Please, inform yourself about this before you start preaching for the destruction of bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency that depends on decentralization) that an increase in block size with zero protections against further mining power centralization would bring.
You cannot, in the least, count on someone acting ethically. There are many powerful players that would love nothing more than to squash bitcoin completely, or co-opt it for their own benefit.
If such an operation was allowed, it would be much, much too late before anyone could do something about it. :(  It is an enormous threat and cannot be waved off by "I don't see it".
Most of the crazy schemes that we see that include indiscriminately increasing max block size come from corporate-backed propaganda campaigns. 
Sadly, many misinformed people, just learning, are taken in and buy the snake oil they're selling. Come in saying things like you're trying to with no real idea what it means.
This, and other legitimate cryptocurrency forums are quite tired of that type of spam and abuse now, though you'll get a lot of knowledge if you ask honest questions without pushing that agenda.
 
@_date: 2016-11-28 01:19:55
This level of crap cannot, in any way, be explained by simple stupidity.
No, dude knows he's selling snake oil. Fortunately, we do too.

@_date: 2017-08-05 05:42:02
2x is just another of Jihan &amp; Co's scams. They have been attacking the Bticoin community, project, and legitimate miners for months and months now.
Some shady nitwits that went for Jihan's latest scheme can just go ahead and be disappointed.
Bitcoin will move on, as it always has. Come ONNN SegWit!
@_date: 2016-06-27 23:48:57
no cost to jsut increasing, willy nilly, the block size?
Dude, you are *completely* ignoring a huge problem.
Larger block size puts large mining conglomerates at a big advantage, and the "average Joe" at a disadvantage.
The risk of encouraging further centralizaton of mining power is very real, and much, much worse than an infinitesimal "big cost to doing nothing". 
The risk of one player gaining 51% or more of mining power would be so disasterous, it is imperative that we have solid protections in place before even thinking about just upping block size.
Besides, there is no "big cost to doing nothing", regardless of all the hype and disinformation spammed here by shady players.
The devs are on it, and in a way that is *good* for bitcoin. There will be no hard fork to increase block size.
@_date: 2016-06-26 20:35:52
What's the point this vid is supposedly supporting?
As blocksize gets bigger, it takes longer and longer and people need more and more bandwidth to even deal with it.
It even supports the 51% risk.  
Interesting, but no idea what you're trying to say.
(sidenote: who the hell downvoted simple facts?)
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:02:00
You mean less subject. Less centralization makes hostile takeeover attempts (like Jihan's x2 nonsence) less of a threat. 
Why Jihan, Ver &amp; Co push their "Big Blocks NOW!" schemes so hard. 
@_date: 2016-11-27 16:40:01
SegWit helps transactions much more than simply upping blocksize would, but *with* very important protections against the risks of simply increasing max block size.
Willy-nilly increasing max block size would put bitcoin in a very dangerous situation, so SegWit is actually the perfect answer. More efficient use of blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:01:38
The only "hatred" shown has been from bad actors such as Jihan, Ver and Co, constantly attacking already established Open Source projects.
They are shunned in crypto and open source communities for damn good reason, as well as those that support them.
@_date: 2016-11-14 23:15:26
You need to look into how things work more if you have "no idea".
The error lies in your lack of knowledge, as you, and all those pushing for an irrational and destructive increase in Max Block Size with zero protections against further mining power centralization have absolutely nothing to back up such assertions.
That is why there never was going to be a hard fork for simply upping max block size, there is no serious debate. The consensus always has been a sane and careful use of the block size.
And yes, 1MB was already too large. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:00:23
perfect time to stock up on more
@_date: 2016-12-14 14:34:21
It is vaporware because it has no chance of actually working.
The "development" will go on indefinitely, scamming as much capital investment as possible. When that dries up, so will the project.
There is nothing to make anyone think this scheme has any legitimacy. If it ever got popular it would fail miserably, which is why it never will actually get off the ground. It's very easy to see if you know the first thing about cryptocurrency. It solves nothing and only adds a ton more complexity and risk.
So, vaporware is a very apt term. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 03:34:49
There is no explanation for such empty, derisive comments.
Those that would love to vastly increase bitcoin's "adoption" 
with zero interest in its longevity and safety...
can go take a flying leap.  
@_date: 2016-11-27 21:29:01
No, the community is very much united, and their voice can be clearly heard here, and other legitimate cryptocurrency forums all over the internet.
What the community is against, and very tired of, is the spamming blatant propaganda and disinformation from get-rich-quick vaporware sellers. The ones trying so desperately to hijack bitcoin's resources for their own profit.
(and failing miserably)
Plenty of them over on /btc if that's your interest...
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:14:27
Bigger blocks would DECREASE the number of users.  Not everyone has the bandwidth to handle running a full node as it is now. Also, it would put smaller mining concerns at a disadvantage, encouraging even more mining power centralization.
If anything, it could be reasonably argued that 1MB is already too large.
@_date: 2016-11-14 22:45:59
For what possible purpose?  So some get rich quick scemes can make a few mill at the majority's cost?
Or large players that would like to destroy bitcoin can more easily launch a 51% attack?
Max block size before SegWit was already too large. SegWit makes all this block size hoopla completely irrelevant now (it was before too, actually).
@_date: 2016-12-09 13:06:49
Ridiculous propaganda is ridiculous.
@_date: 2016-12-18 11:31:46
SegWit is an actually beneficial, fully developed thing. It is being used as we speak.
This lightning nonsense isn't even out of alpha development. Unfortunately, it is being promoted, and sold for profit, as if it was an actual product. AKA vaporware.
There is zero comparison between the two. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:03:58
Hard for for what?  Don't be silly. 
SegWit is a no brainer.  A few greedy miners will try to hold all of us back, but they'll come around sooner or later.
@_date: 2016-11-25 18:19:05
of a very deliberate and willful nature.
Actually, that's called a scam artist, not bad judgement.
At this point, there is no doubt to give him the benefit of.
@_date: 2016-12-14 14:30:33
It has zero to do with bitcoin. It is nothing more than another altcoin, that then transfers whatever they use into bitcoin.
They are asking us to completely trust them with our money, like an exchange, but with none of the benefits or securities.
What happens when their exchange for Lightningcoin -&gt; Bitcoin gets held up? This is inevitable if enough people start using it, which is why it is doomed from the start.
It solves nothing, while adding a ton of complexity and much more risk. No thanks.
Bitcoin is an actual, real, trustworthy solution.
@_date: 2017-08-06 10:45:54
hahaah  no.  People are dumping Jihan's newest scamcoin as fast as they can find fools that will offer anything for it. 
Its "worth" will soon flatline at $0.  The only thing keeping that from happening is Jihan, Ver &amp; their goons pumping it artificially.
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control with anything of real value.
@_date: 2017-08-07 10:39:17
A fork can refer to a project, within itself, making an new version incompatible with the old. In this case they have every claim to the name and other resources (blockchiain) as it is the *same* project.
A fork can also mean a completely separate project using anther's source code as a starting point. In this case they have no claim to the parent project's resources whatsoever.
Trying to hijack another project's name, reputation, other resources like blockchain etc... is extremely shady business, and is seen in all of Open Source as extremely abusive. 
Those that do this, such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. earn every bit of disdain they get for it.
@_date: 2017-08-07 10:47:39
You don't seem to understand what a fork is.
If it is done internally, by the same project, the name, blockchain and other resources remain with that project.
If a *separate* project uses anther's source code as a starting point, the resources of the parent project remain wholly its own. The new project requires a new name, blockchain, etc.
These are both considered forks, but have very different rules depending on their origin.
Your idea that it is any way ok to attempt stealing the name, good reputation, any other resources of another Open Source project is what has no basis in reality.
Such abuse is detested in all of Open Source, and a very fast way to completely ruin your reputation. 
Jihan, Ver and other such bad actors that have constantly tried such, deserve every bit of disdain they recieve.
@_date: 2016-11-09 20:28:33


Agreed.  
Get rich quick scam artists, and large established banking institutions would love nothing more than to increase max block size with NO PROTECTIONS against the havoc they would cause for their own greedy profit.
There is no real debate, because the only people FOR this, are  directly working AGAINST bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general.
Nobody in their right mind is actually going to go for that, as history has shown.
Again, we basically agree. The only "debate" is trumped up by a tiny minority of already wealthy players willing to throw the rest of us (even all of  us) under a bus.
@_date: 2016-11-14 22:59:38
Damn straight.
All the get-rich-quick vaporware scam artists pouring so much advertising money into manufacturing some bogus "block size debate" are only destructive influences.
Anyone that actually knows a thing or three about cryptocurrency, how bitcoin works anyway, would never consider it, and has not.
Carefully moving forward, slowly, with safety in mind is key.  There was never going to be any hard fork just to increase max block size. In fact, it could be argued 1MB was already too big.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:59:58


LOL  The price plummets with every block found.
Also very funny how often they repeat how "successful" it is, when people can't even deposit anywhere but a couple shady exchanges.

Minus value in fact. Such unscrupulous behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2016-11-08 00:27:55
Exactly what cryptocurrency project are you promoting?
How do they intend to deal with the threat of further mining power centralization when increasing max block size?
There need be no discussion unless there is a very reasonable and sane answer to that question. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 04:10:55
Indeed, 1MB was too large to begin with. You  meant increase, not cap.
Even more insane to wantonly increase it even more with no plan to protect against the danger that would bring.
Ain't gonna happen.


Through what magic could that possibly happen?  The only thing instantly increased max block size would bring is to even more benefit already insanely powerful mining operations and other wealthy players.
What miners invest is for their own profit, nothing else. Their goals are profit, bitcoin's goals are usefulness. They are largely incompatible. Putting miner's first cannot, and will not happen.


It has nothing at all to do with hacking. Undermining yes, quite possibly. Much more possible with a reckless increase in max block size. The truth is exactly the opposite of the nonsense you're talking.
**With increased max block size, with no safety protections, a wealthy player, state, bank conglomerate, corporate, or otherwise could much more easily launch a 51% attack. That is the reality of the situation.**
This is a very serious threat, and you're trying to convince people of the *opposite*?


This yahoo is straight up spewing gibberish now.
This is the very worst kind of spam. Straight up, blatant disinformation.

@_date: 2016-12-14 14:09:02
You have to be pretty dense to think bitcoin would survive putting miner's interest over the longevity and security of bitcoin.
Thankfully, the vast majority of us here, and other legitimate bitcoin forums, are well aware of the dangers your type of "logic" brings with it.
There will be no hard fork to increase max block size. There never was a question of this.  Just a bunch of hype and disinformation from scam artists and their corporate advertising money.
@_date: 2016-12-14 14:40:35
"decentralization" in the context of cryptocurrency has to do with mining and nodes. It has zero to do with the project itself.
There is the bitcoin project, and there are those that would piggyback on it for their own profit. Such despicable actions are discouraged with extreme prejudice in the Open Source world.
A project's code is open, its resources (name, and in this case, blockchain) are NOT open. They belong to the project itself.
So no, there is no "decentralized bitcoin world" as you are referring to it. This type of blatant disinformation and propaganda has been spewed all too much here lately, and we're all tired of such spam.
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:58:38


There is no risk of this happening in the first place.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2016-11-27 20:10:27
No, we only need SegWit.
Effecient use of blocks. There is no reason currently to further risk even more mining power centralization.
Point 2 can be completely left out.
IF a smart answer like SegWit is, some day, not enough (for normal bitcoin users, and larger players with actual integrity), there is plenty of time to come to an intelligent answer.
Willy-nilly increasing max block size for no other reason than greed of a few already super-wealthy players (or destructive powers), is insanity.
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:55:25
False.  The only reason average users no longer run full nodes is because it takes so much bandwidth now.
Running a full node is very, very good. You can validate your own transactions instead of trusting outside parties.
It guards against hostile shenanigans from bad actors (hi Jihan).
Running a full node is a no-brainer. Arguing against it is either naive, or dishonest.
@_date: 2016-12-05 10:21:16

That is absolute bullshit.
The mods here are tolerant to a fault. 
And again, instead of any intelligent reasons to back up your insane assertions, we, yet again, only see ridiculous, completely baseless shaming attempts.
Also, blockstream is not bitcoin. The 2 or three devs that tried to "make a deal" with mining interests in china, ridiculously promising a dangerous increase in max block size with zero protections against its dangers, fully deserved to be ridiculed. 
Zero integrity there.
What do you actually mean with "push rights"?  Are you talking about making pull requests?  Might at least want to get your jargon down before making ridiculous statements.  
Now, say something intelligent that actually supports your assertions. If you cannot, don't be surprised if they are seen as just more abusive spam.
@_date: 2016-12-14 14:02:08
There is no legitimate "debate" here. 
There is zero legitimate reason to indiscriminately increase max block size. This would only benefit already too large mining operations, further centralizing mining power,
or help destructive elements that would love to co-opt, or destroy, bitcoin.
There will be no hard fork just to increase max block size. There never was any chance of that happening, no matter how much money shady scam artists pour into propaganda saying otherwise.
@_date: 2016-11-27 21:26:06

the community is tired of the propaganda about OP's illogical point 2.
@_date: 2016-11-27 20:16:04
What reason is there for raising the max block size? To increase the profit already huge mining conglomerates? To further disadvantage the average Joe miner?  Not a good idea. 
Not to mention that raising max block size with zero protections against a 51% attack various destructive influences would love to create (governments and the banks that run them) is insanity.
There is so, so much loud propaganda and disinformation being spewed by the ones that would profit most from such insanity. So, so little actual logic or plan that make sense for such a dangerous block size increase. That is why their get-rich-quick scams are seen for what they are. Scam-artist snake oil.
We need slow, intelligent growth. Careful, with protections against the very real threat of letting bitcoin become just another controllable fiat, or being outright destroyed.
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:43:46
Offer an actual legitimate reason for indesriminately increasing max block size.
We never hear any, only ridiculous shaming attempts (aka big block propaganda) and straight up disinformation.
Nobody in their right mind wants to even further centralize mining power, as willy-nilly increasing max block size would. There was never a question of consensus. No hard fork for increasing max block size is going to happen.
Bitcoin is doing just fine, no matter how much advertising money destructive get-rich-quck scammers spend trying to push such baseless hype.
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:46:17
There is absolutely no comparison between the cesspool of disinformation that is /btc,

@_date: 2016-11-14 22:47:50
And and incredibly stupid thing to do with zero protections against further mining power centralization. 
Which is why nobody in their right mind was actually for such a ludicrous idea.
Upping max block size with no consideration to the HUGE risks that would bring was never going to happen, despite what a few well-funded scam artists tried to hype.
@_date: 2016-11-20 17:49:22
Easy enough, it wasn't much of anything to begin with I guess.
@_date: 2016-12-14 14:18:53
So, nothing to do with bitcoin. 
What's this "thinblock" altcoin you speak of, and don't they have their own forum? 
@_date: 2016-11-28 02:33:02


Raising max block size just for that is insanity. That is why nobody is for it, except for already-too-large mining concerns, some get-rich-quick scam artists (hello Classic Coin, Unlimited &amp; Co.) and destructive elements like too-big-to-fail banking conglomerates.
There  can be no "compromise". That means the compromise of safety and longevity of bitcoin. Miner's profits can never, ever take a front seat, let alone the threat of even worse motives.
There is no debate over this. Never has been, just lots of advertising money dumped into blatant propaganda trying to hype up some fantasy "issue" with zero actual backup of facts.
Well, except the ones you just pointed out.  Willy-nilly increasing max block size would directly benefit the already too centralized power players, further disadvantage the average Joe, and massively increase the chance of an attack from the subversive fiat monopolists.
We need a way to keep the mining power spread out, else the entire decentralized benefit cryptocurrency has in its favor, dies. This is key to the survival and usefulness of bitcoin. 
There is every reason to be VERY wary and careful of even further centralization of mining power, and the threat of subversive influences that would like nothing more than to launch a 51% attack to take over, or destroy bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency that becomes popular).
So, tell us again please, how does any "compromise" to bitcoin's longevity and security benefit anyone else but the ones it is so useful in getting around?  
No, there will be no hard fork simply to increase max block size. Not without VERY careful, bullet-proof precautions in place.  SegWit and such plans for the *safe, efficient* use of blocks is enough. 
If the scam artists, get-rich-quck vaporware sellers and banks can't deal with it, they can simply take a walk.
@_date: 2016-11-06 20:17:25
No, there was no "news" 18 months ago, or any other time.
Again, this is hype pushed by shady get-rich-quick scam artists with large corporately funded advertising budgets.
There never was any legitimate question. Nobody in their right mind is going to give bitcoin development over to a tiny handful of devs with some crazy vaporware.
Especially ones that don't have the integrity to make a legitimate altcoin. Trying to piggyback onto the good name of another cryptocurrency project is shameful. This is not how open source works. The *code source* is open to use and modify. The parent project's *resources* are not.
Blockstream is what it is. It has zero to do with bitcoin. Just another business trying to get rich off of cryptocurrency. 
Block*stream* != Blockchain. 
Your  there is really really pushing reality. If you said a dev or 2, ok.. the "majority"??  Where did you hear that from?
Please don't say /btc.  If so, it was a joke, like the rest of that sub.
@_date: 2016-11-29 09:25:04
Irrelevant. My point stands.
There will always be miners. It is in bitcoin's (and all crytocurrency that depends on decentralization's)) best interest to keep that mining power as decentralized as possible.
What is good for miners takes a back seat to bitcoin's security, stability and longevity.  Full Stop.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:15:08
The "arguments" for on chain scaling, willy nilly increasing block size, have no technical merit. 
Quite the opposite, it will even further centralize mining power, which is why bad actors such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are constantly pushing for it.

What they've been trying all along with such hostile takeover attempts is to turn Bitcoin into a centrally controlled payment system, for their own greedy benefit.
This, and other legit crypto forums all over the web have been plagued by their disinformation and propaganda campaigns. It is well known that Ver even pays for shills. :(
Big Business isn't interested in the longevity or usefulness of Bitcoin. The FUD they spread is for profit.
@_date: 2016-11-14 22:55:18
Are you *seriously* trying to argue that simply upping max block size to 2mb alone is anything like a sane thing to do?
That would only increase mining power centralization, making a 51% attack much more likely.  Insanity.
No, there never was the slightest chance of that happening, and for damn good reason.
@_date: 2017-08-07 10:35:31

Putting bitcoin in jeopardy to ensure even MORE mining profit is insanity.
@_date: 2016-12-06 00:54:01
We do not agree that "off chain scaling" is inevitable.  
Where did you get that idea from?
That is the one thing about SegWit that is a horrible idea (IMHO). 
That is also off topic though.
Larger blocks means more efficiency of network bandwidth and power consumption for large mining operations. Not just over the internet, but internally. 
This is a rather well known dynamic. I mentioned it before but still you go on and on about... indiscriminately increasing block size for no good reason.
If there was a benefit to such, the bitcoin dev team would have implemented it LONG ago. 
No, there will be no hard fork for such, no it is not needed.
Yes, it would further increase centralization of mining power, and worse, increase the ease of a 51% attack that destructive (and very wealthy) players such as banks and governments would love to accomplish.
SegWit is not perfect, but it is VASTLY superior to such madness.
Also, who told you people wait DAYS to get transaction through?  Please, stop spreading such nonsense.
@_date: 2016-11-15 17:42:15

If they want to risk bitcoin's longevity and safety in exchange for even MORE profit, good riddance to them.

Cash, credit card, debit card. All much better suited.
Or, now that bad actors (hi Jihan) aren't blocking SegWit, all manner of more efficient payment methods will become available. 
If you insist on using Bitcoin for petty payments, sidechains or something like Lightning are the way to go.
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:52:39

At some point, Bitcoin will reach a plateau (somewhere around the vicinity of the Moon),
then spending / trading them will become more attractive.
You can always trade them for a currency that is easier to use for daily living. Wide adoption is pretty irrelevant.

There is no legitimate "dissent".  
Spam = blatant disinformation and propaganda spewed from advertising departments of destructive vaporware pushers (or worse). Spam = bad for bitcoin. It has zero to do with "like", it has everything to do with actual reality.
There is zero good reason to indiscriminately increase max block size. It would only further centralize mining power.  Ain't gonna happen.
Those promoting such a destructive path either 1. have no idea what they are talking about and are unwittingly repeating disinformation or 2. know exactly what they are doing and try to fool the people in group 1.
Fortunately, this, and other legitimate bitcoin forums are full of people who actually know the score. Such propaganda attempts are very easy to spot nowadays, and we're all tired of that crap.
@_date: 2016-11-14 22:43:22
For what reason?  More *efficient" use of block size means we can *decrease* max block size. 
Anyway, as others have pointed out, in certain circumstances, larger blocks are possible with SegWit,  but intelligently, not just willy-nilly increasing them.
@_date: 2016-11-27 21:07:06
Bingo.  
Aggressive hijack attempts of a parent / sister open source project's resources are to be discouraged with extreme prejudice. 
This thread, and so many more like it, are just so much spam. :(

Resources, in the context of Open Source, are the name of a project, and in the case of cryptocurrency, that project's blockchain.
"this all" is based on long standing best practices and open source licensing.  Shady outfits like the ones I listed have proven to have zero credibility, or integrity.
The only "parroting" going on here is the blatant disinformation being spread by such shady outfits, and their hangers-on.
Misquoting Satoshi, completely out of context in a desperate attempt to support some ridiculous assertion is just one example of said disinformation.

Now that bad actors aren't blocking progress anymore, SegWit will be locked in soon. 
It opens the door to all kinds of efficient ways to make petty payments.
Give it a little time.
@_date: 2016-12-17 03:18:00
That is simply the truth.
It could be argued that our current max block size of 1MB is too large.
That was a bad decision.  Increasing it again would be a horrible thing, not without very strong, careful protections in place against further centralization of mining power.
We need to encourage more diverse spread of miners and full nodes, not encourage their conglomeration.
A 51% attack is a very real threat and cannot be ignored.  Miners be damned.
@_date: 2016-11-09 20:23:27
that PDF link supports nothing you're saying. There is no huge fantasy "debate" contained within about max block  size.
Block size is not maxed out... was not, and now with SegWit and more efficient use of blocks, won't be.
Even if they were "maxed out" (another hype propaganda term), to increase block size with zero thought as to the very real threat of a 51% attack it would encourage, is insanity.
Large block size is beneficial to already huge mining farms (and other powerful players) and it is detrimental to the Average Joe miner.  This is clear. 
Yes, costs play a roll in that. To say they don't, as you are asserting, is the ludicrous assertion.
No, there never was a huge "debate", no there was never a question of a hard fork over something like max block size.
Again, it's just a bunch of hype and empty "DOOM!" from get rich quick artists that would directly benefit from such.
The VAST majority of bitcoin users would be disadvantaged, and without serious, careful planning against mining centralization, it would be a *ludicrous* threat to bitcoin, or any similar cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2016-11-20 17:09:55
So we agree that with SegWit active, there whole silly business of blocksize increase has become even more silly.
That run-on sentence of yours was hard to follow. 
Now, after reading again 3x, I think we agree that any such critisizm of segwit would be just as shady and ridiculous as the "Increase Block Size NOW!" crap that is so often slung here.
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:56:00
More efficient transport (in this case, effecient use of the current max block size) is an infinitely better idea.
@_date: 2016-11-28 05:48:55
My agenda is directly against such scams such as BU &amp; Co. 
Also the ridiculous idea that increasing max block size alone can, in any way, be good for bitcoin. 
The bitcoin blockchain is a resource of the *bitcoin project*.  This is not a difficult idea to grasp. Do not make the mistake of thinking people will agree with you here on that.
Hijacking another open source project's name and resources is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all open source communities.
This also includes names.  There is one bitcoin project, its dev team, its resources, and then there are pretenders unscrupulously trying to profit from stealing those resources for their own project.
There is no two ways to see this.
Bitcoin has a HUGE amount of devs.  Much more than almost any other cryptocurrency project. Where are you getting your "information" anyway?
What do YOU want bitcoin to become?  It will never replace fiat. It was never meant to. It is a very useful alternative. That is all.
A very *un*safe model is what you are suggesting, having just any yahoo call themselves bitcoin, using its name and blockchain for whatever nefarious greedy goals, with no thought to the actual bitcoin project, or its users.
No, that shit don't fly.
Anyone can write their own code based on bitcoin. What they CANNOT do, not with any shred of integrity, is call themselves bitcoin, nor use its blockchain.
If they want to contribute, making a pull request is the only legitimate way. 
OR, make a damn altcoin. That is good too. Competition is great. If they come up with a better coin, hell, I'll use it!
What I, and cryptocurrency aficionados will NOT abide is scammers and spammers trying to aggressively hijack the reputation and resources for their own profit. Again, this is standard in open source. If you have been told differently, you have been lied to.
Do not repeat those lies and expect them to be accepted in any legitimate cryptocurrency forum, including here.
Again, make your own altcoin. Fully, legitimately, wonderfully encouraged by the entire community. Do it right, do it well, you will succeed. If this is refused, if a child / sibling project insists on the shady business of stealing the source project's resources for their gain, prepare to be ridiculed at every corner.
The err.. "netowork"?  err... no.. The bitcoin project can only evolve as fast as is reasonable, and safe.  Longevity and usefulness trumps mining profits, and very much trumps shady get-rich-quick scam artists' ridiculous demands, such as immediate an wanton increase of max block size.
The danger of a 51% attack by doing such would not just come from miners you see, but from other powerful players that would love to co-opt or downright destroy bitcoin.
So your "stagnation" is actually a welcome thing, if it means bitcoin survives in the long run.
Opening it up to just any shady handful of shady devs trying to use it's resources for themselves is the exact opposite.
If and when bitcoin progresses, as with SegWit, then of course a new client might be needed. What program has updates without a new version?  Ridiculous.
If that group of "tallented" devs you talk about does not make a legitimately compatible, bona fide bitcoin wallet, then they have no business affiliating themselves with bitcoin whatsoever.
To trust our money to such shady outfits is only asking for disaster.  
None of the err.. "points" you are making are new. They are misrepresentations read so often here. Not sure where you picked up those twisted ideas of what open source is, but it's time to give them up, or move on to easier targets.
We here in this, and other legitimate bitcoin, and cryptocurrency forums, actually support cryptocurrency and open source. 
No worries, while you're learning the ropes, bitcoin will be doing just fine.

"disgruntled", seriously?  NO, it is a sane way to proceed. 
The only people that are disgruntled are the scam artists that have been pouring massive amounts of advertising money into disinformation and hype to increase max block size with *zero protections*.
Yah, max block size of 1MB was arguably too big anyway.  We don't need even more centralization of mining power.  SegWit uses block size more efficiently. This is a true answer.
Simply willy-nilly increasing max block size would be insane (well, except for the scam artists and destructive players that would like to co-opt or destroy bitcoin).
@_date: 2016-12-09 12:21:57
The first is imperative. We need to encourage the Average Joe. This encourages distribution of nodes and mining power.
The second is irrelevant to anyone but the already-too-large operators that it benefits. The average user, the majority of us, have zero to gain from bitcoin being used *only* for large transactions.

There is no serious scaling "debate".
There are concerns, and plans, but the whole block size "debate" and "consensus" nonsense is pushed by vaporware scam artists just looking for a quick buck.
I suppose if you mean something other than the blocksize and consensus nonsense with your use of "debate", then we probably agree more than not... 
Still, there is no reason to use the word debate even for scaling. There is a very well laid out plan. Carefully, slowly is the way.
Bitcoin and its road map are doing just fine.
@_date: 2016-11-15 18:00:20
There is zero risk of bitcoin hardforking just to increase max block size.
There never was, despite the disinformation and blatant propaganda a handful of scam artists try to spread.
Upping max block size with no precautions against further mining power centralization would be insane. The only people *for* such a thing directly want to profit from it, or have been taking in by such scams.
No, bitcoin is doing just fine.

What you have just described is called an altcoin.
If someone has a better idea, and a shred of integrity, they'd make one instead of trying to hijack the bitcoin project's resources.
The code is open source, the resources for each project (name, blockchain, and forums for that matter) belong to the project.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:51:40
What Opne Source means is that you are free to copy  the source code for your own project.
What it does NOT mean, is you can steal the resources of the parent project. 
Shady takeover attempts such as tying to use the name, and in this case blockchain, of an already established project, is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:03:33
False. 
If a 51% attack managed to hijack Bitcoin, Bitcoin would no longer exist. 
Even if shady gangsters such as Jihan managed to take over the Bitcoin blockchain, it would not be Bitcoin anymore.
There is one Bitcoin project. The name, blockchain, and other resources belong to that project alone. That is how open source works.
Anyone is free to use the source code for their *own* project, but the hostile takeover attempts Jihan, Ver &amp; Co consistently try (XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, x2, BCH...) are discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.

Miners' interests, and the lognevity and security of bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency, are largely opposite.
Not all people promoting such destructive actions such as willy-nilly increasing max block size are miners.
There are plenty of much more destructive players, equally or even more powerful, that would love nothing more than to co-opt bitcoin, or destroy it outright.
This will not be allowed to happen. 
It is "like" nothing but protecting bitcoin's longevity and usefulness. We need no lame synonyms for it.
Only an idiot thinks that putting miner's interests at the forefront is in any way good for bitcoin. 
Again, this will not be allowed to happen, 
despite such blatant disinformation and propaganda attempts.
We're all rather tired of that crap now. 
Go sell your snake oil elsewhere.
@_date: 2016-12-14 13:54:09
The average bitcoin user was meant, as opposed to already too large mining operations you want to defend. This is very obvious.
There are less nodes because increasing max block size to 1MB made it easier for mining power to be centralized into huge mining outfits. 
Indiscriminately increasing max block size simply to benefit them is insanity. It would only further centralize mining power. 
Ain't gonna happen like that. There will be no hard fork just to up max block size. There was never a question of this.
If a tiny bit more in fees is what is needed to ensure bitcoin's longevity and usefulness, it is a very, very small price to pay.
If already too large mining outfits (or other, even more destructive players) don't like it, they can take a walk.
@_date: 2019-08-21 23:59:56

Usually they go through some kind of confusion attempt first though
This one just went straight to shit-slinging. That's usually saved for a little farther down a thread.
We're all really tired of such crap.
The bitcoin project is run by the bitcoin dev team.  All others are pretenders or derisive influences.
Anyone can contribute. Make a pull request if you have what you think is better code.
That is how Open Source works.
Competition is a good thing. If they had anything worthy they'd show us, by making an altcoin.
If they had a better altcoin plan, it would be successful.  The CODE open to use, under open source license,  but another prject's *resources* ARE NOT (like name, reputation, and in this case blockchain).
That is how open source works.
Trying to hijack another Open Source project with bullshit like  "let MEEE control now!" is, again, a sure sign of get-rich-quck artists. Such is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all Open Source communities.
They push vaporware instead of actually producing anything valuable, and would be the death of bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) if people took them seriously.
Thankfully, apart from the blatant shills they pay, and some unsuspecting people new to cryptocurrency that they fool for a while, nobody actually does take them seriously.
@_date: 2016-11-27 21:01:52
There is one implementation of bitcoin.
You are talking about an *altcoin*.  Competition is good. Until now, bitcoin has some legitimate competition, but none are as big. Those calling themselves "bitcoin", but only trying to hijack the project's blockchain and name aar nothing but a bunch of vaporware scam artists trying to hijack the mother project's resources. :(
That "uphill battle" you talk of is the only respectable way to get your altcoin adopted. If someone *actually* had a better idea, implemented it with the required integrity, we'd all be using it now.
Actually, there are some really good altcoins that have large followings. Bitcoin is just the biggest, most successful to date (and as such, prime target for said scam-artist snake oil salesmen).
Attempting to hijack the resources of another project for their own profit is discouraged with extreme prejudice in open source, as it damn well should be.

No, using a "lightning" wallet, your money goes into limbo. It is only transferred into bitcoin once they (the people that have your money) transfer it back into bitcoin.
That transfer point is subject to every normal bitcoin delay that the people behind this sham falsely claim it is suppose to fix.
Not only that, but worse. If delayed long enough, it opens you up to the risk of the funds being reverted back to the sender, even though service or goods were already provided.
The entire scam is fatally flawed from the start.

Maybe a bit of a learning curve for those that don't know linux, but there are several good tutorials out there, and the hardware ins't that expensive.

Do believe you can set it up to only be a "light" node though, and have control of the other nodes it trusts.

Why, oh why would they do that?  
What is this holy grail of "block size over all"!!  ?
So much bullshit being spewed by scam artists, with zero reasons given. 
We can very much trust the bitcoin devs to protect the bitcoin project against dangerous increase in max block size. That has never been in question.
Damn good thing too. If the "Increase Block Size Now!" scam artists actually had a shred of integrity, they'd have made their own altcoin by now, and *proven* their idea works better.
Until now, none of them are anywhere even close. Never were. No, theirs is the "hidden agenda". Get-rich-quick schemes that are nothing but a danger to the longevity and usefulness of cryptocurrencies.

Overall, on average a pretty steady, slow climb though.
There was a big spike when Ver was running his BCH scam so hard, but that seems to have died down now.

There is no legitimate "debate" and never was a question of consensus. 
What there is though, is deep pockets for advertising vaporware that is directly detrimental to bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general. We're all pretty tired of this nonsense.
Indiscriminately increasing max block size is a ridiculous idea and there never was any danger of that happening.
There will be no hard fork for such a thing. Much too dangerous with zero benefit to anyone but already too large mining operations, and destructive players that would like to co-opt or destroy bitcoin.
Better use of blocks is the way forward.

A 51% attack is a very real threat. Only scam artists were pushing to willy-nilly increase it with zero protections.
SegWit makes their nonsense even more nonsensical. Effecient, safe use of blocks is the answer.

Oh please.
Block size absolutely has a very real influence on centralization. The larger the blocks (all other things being equal) the more benefit to such already-too-large mining outfits, and to the determent of the average Joe miner. 
This Belshe dude has zero to do with bitcoin. He's a corporate profiteer, pushing propaganda and disinformation for personal gain, like so many others.
You can repeat as much corporate propaganda as you like from such shady outfits, it won't change the facts of how cryptocurrency in general, and bona fide bitcoin specifically, works.
@_date: 2016-12-05 19:50:26
Sorry, more shit sliinging is only making your case worse.
Bitcoin 101 is we are primarily interested in the longevity and usefulness of bitcoin.
What is good for miners isn't even secondary. Miners mine because bitcoin is popular, (and not even that, there are miners that mine dogecoin ffs). 
Make a good cryptocurrency, and miners will come.
Thank goodness the bitcoin dev team don't listen to such ridiculous ideas such as "but the miners!!".  
Else very soon there would be no bitcoin to mine.
Those that are frustrated because they cannot co-opt this Open Source project purely for their own greedy profit can leave the mining business. In fact, they are to be encouraged to do so with extreme prejudice.
There are mining pools that have approached that crucial 51%, and do you know what they did?
They didn't cry for more tolerance and faith, no, they split up into smaller groups, voluntarily.
That shows that those groups had bitcoin at heart, not their own greed.
The ones that are spending so much advertising money, uselessly clamoring propaganda about "max block size NOW!!  DOOOOOMM!, (with exactly as much factual, logical backup to their assertions as you have, aka Zero)  are nothing but snake oil salesmen.
Why don't you try /btc, they love that type there.

BCH is not bitcoin in any way, shape or form.

Lightning has not even gotten out of alpha testing. Also, it has zero to do with bitcoin.
by all rights, it is an altcoin, or at best an exchange.
The way this scam is set up, it needs to go through the bitcoin blockchain, so is, in fact, subject to any and all "disadvantages" it claims to fix.
Plus, they want you to trust THEM with your money until they transfer it into bitcoin. 
Much more complexity, much less security, and zero benefit.
Segwit, on the other hand, actually works and is going live right now. 
That is something the lightning vaporware never will achieve. Fatally flawed from the beginning. As soon as investors realize this, the money dries up, and that "project" goes &gt;poof&lt;!
On a human note, this type of blatant shit slinging, calling people "turds" and worse, accompanied by a deafening silence when asked exactly what such scams are suppose to do, and how, that is so typical of "supporters" of such vaporware.

Roger Ver is well known for using paid shills.

It is simply a ridiculous idea. The only people into this fantacy are snake oil salesmen out for a quick buck.
They should just make their own altcoin. They won't though, they'd rather scam bitcoin users.
There never was a question about "consensus" at all. The consensus is, and was, that 1MB max block size is fine for now, and SegWit has made these cockamamy "moar block size now!" theories even more ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-06-11 08:36:20
Seriously though... every post about huge peaks or dives is obviously ridiculous when you zoom out to the 3-Year view.

No, there never was any legitimate "debate".  Only a ton of corporate advertising money being spent by scam artists to spread disinformation for their own greedy profit.
Nobody in their right mind, that actually knows a thing about cryptocurrency, is, or was willing to willy-nilly raise max block size with zero protections in place against even further centralization of mining power.
There never was a question of this at all.  
your 1) is true, your 2) is nonsense, and now your question of "maxed out" (which was never a danger) has been washed away by SegWit.  
If anything the max block size at 1MB is *too large*. Now SegWit brings more effecient use of blocks, and the whole non-argument just gets even more absurd.
@_date: 2016-11-15 18:01:14
Realistically, 1MB is even too large. 1kb might be overdoing it, doncha think?.
Anyway, (especially with SegWit now) smaller than 1mb is fully possible, and in many cases, preferable. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:35:53


There's no way to guarantee this, or even think it.  If lightning became popular, it would have exactly the same problems they are claiming to fix, which is why it won't ever see large-scale usage.
@_date: 2016-12-17 04:54:38


There is no "big-block" camp.  Just a ton of advertising money pourd into hype and disinformation with zero logical points behind it.
See, we're all rather sich of that nonsense here, and on other legitimate cryptocurrency forums.
Centralization of nodes is also a major issue, yes.
Mining is in no way as centralized as it can get.  We are dangerously close to that all important 51% attack vector though.
Such would be the end of bitcoin. That cannot, will not be allowed.
Indiscriminately increasing max block size (and yes it would be indiscriminate, as there is zero logical reason for it, not without very careful protections in place!) is not just a "different opinion",  it is madness.
Again, unless there is a clear plan, careful, slowly and meticulously thought out, then it is not worth consideration.  This is not opinion, it is necessary for the survival and security of bitcoin.
If you actually have a *legitimate* differing opinion, you need to back it up with convincing reason.
How the hell is the slowdown of ASIC tech development suppose to protect against further mining power centralization?  That makes no sense.
We need to return to days where individuals had an interest in mining, running full nodes too. We need more affordable mining gear, and  discouragement for running huge mining operations.
Increasing max block size willy-nilly only helps already-too-big miner outfits (and much more destructive players).
Until now, we've seen no real argument that offsets that threat.
@_date: 2016-12-14 14:48:08

When talking about the already dangerously large centralization of mining power
that such huge players represent, a decrease in their profits can only be a good thing.
We need a plan to benefit smaller miners. Decentralization is key for bitcoin's longevity.

(well, except the ones selling the scheme).

heh,  you've said zero to back up any of your absurd claims.
No, see, this and other legitimate bitcoin forums actually *are* literate in the tech of cryptocurrency. 
It is clear to see that this vaporware lightning coin is hardly in alpha stage, and has fatal flaws that doom it from the start. 
As soon as the corporate investors they are scamming realize this, the money will stop, and the "project" will disappear.
Better to sell your snake oil elsewhere. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 02:52:31
Indeed. Mining interests can never, ever take a front seat. That way lies madness. There has never been a legitimate argument for such insanity, only disinformation and propaganda with zero logical backup.
Also opens up a cryptocurrency to the threat of a 51% attack from people dead-set on keeping control of our finances with fiat.

This type of behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in Open Source.

@_date: 2016-12-08 15:38:59
Exactly the opposite actually. 
Increasing max block size indiscriminatly will directly benefit already too huge mining outfits, and other wealthy players (many with bad intentions). They are your PayPal. 
It can be argued that max bock size is already too large at 1MB.  We need to encourage the average Joe, not put him at an even greater disadvantage.
Also, there are not less nodes because of low blocksize. Please stop repeating such blatant disinformation.
Again, it's exactly the opposite.
@_date: 2016-12-09 12:46:49

SegWit allows the use of larger blocks too. Dynamically. Or smaller ones as needed of course.

It is not only I that hold this strong view, but actually, the entire open source community. It is grounded and built on just such ideas.
The source is open, the resources of a project, are not.
To take something from another project and claim it as your own is fraud. It goes against every open source license in modern use.
The number of devs working on the bitcoin project is the number that contribute to that project. That is very clear and simple.
Anyone can make pull requests. Do you know what that is?  Submitting code. If it is accepted, the person  is  then, ofically, a bitcoin dev.
Working on a seperate project, even if writing one comma in a different place, if it is not accepted to the bitcoin project, then it is a *derivative* of bitcoin, not bitcoin proper. To use / sell code or services based on that non-bitcoin project, but call it bitcoin, is extremely shady business (as with any open source project, by no means exclusive only to bitcoin).
Lawsuits have been booked and won over such unscrupulous actions. This is, actually, standard practice, though you, and whoever you got your ideas from, seem to have no respect for these industry standards. :(


Ok, this is a different subject now, very much particular to cryptocurrency, specifically bitcoin.  
It can NEVER be allowed to hold miner's interests as top priority. Considered, ok, but they take a back seat to usefulness, safety, longevity. It must be so. It seems very obvious when you consider that what is good for miners (at least in the short term), could be (and very often is) very, very destructive for bitcoin. 
There need be no "core" added. It is simply bitcoin. There are no other bitcoin devs apart from the ones submitting code to the bitcoin project.
For example, these scam artists that called themselves "Classic Bitcoin", had nothing to do with bitcoin whatsoever. They are held in extremely low regard in cryptocurrency circles, for the reasons I explained.
Not only that, but they have spent enormous amounts of advertising money spamming propaganda and disinformation on legitimate cryptocurrency and bitcoin forums like this one, wasting countless time and energy with their vaporware.
This is also part of the reason why projects like theirs, this "ultimate" and so many other get-rich-quick scams are so detested, as well as the simple lack of integrity they display, aggressively trying to hijack another project's resources.
Seriously dark days. We still see threads spamming such ludicrous schemes. /btc still brigades such threads here, though it has calmed down some now, thank goodness.
Be very careful with those Blockstream people, they've proven to be untrustworthy. I disagree that they have any business, at all, dictating how bitcoin should evolve. They are a for-profit business, inherently untrustworthy if for no other reason than that.
Same with that Ethereum outfit.
I find it very, very dangerous to trust any company and their for-profit motives. They are far, far too easy to manipulate by large financial institutions.
I don't have many bitcoins myself, do dabble in lightcoin now n then, just for fun. I wouldn't be caught dead supporting the shady projects I've mentioned. 
Whenever I see something promoted on that cesspool /btc, I know to star WIDE clear. 
Anyway, it's been interesting. Have fun with yer bitcoins there Mr. Pirate. And please, do some research on *actual* open source and its best practice policies. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 12:35:08
There is a natural cap to how high fees can go. 
The more nodes we have, the better, and there is no cap except the very bad trend of centralization of mining power / full nodes we've seen lately.
If slowly growing fees (up to that natural cap) encourage people to run their own full nodes, this can only be a good thing.
Indiscriminately increasing max block size only will further the centralization of mining power, decreasing bitcoin's safety and sustainability. This is not an option.
More efficient use of blocks, such as SegWit brings with it, is a careful and sane solution.

Shady bad actors behind BCash are the ones that blocked SegWit for so long. 
Now they have been forced to stop that crap by the threat of a UASF, and SegWit has been irreversibly activated.
BCH is just another in a long line of hostile takeover attempts from get-rich-quick scam artists that were blocking Bitcoin progress (Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.).
There is nothing "usable" about it, except for the original dump. It is a centrally controlled fake. Not even a true altcoin, nor fork.

Ver is well known for using paid shills to push his scams, and it's very obvious when it's going on.  Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, BCH... none have any technical merit, all only supported by scam artists and the occasional Crypto newbie that (for a time) buys the snake oil.

Not my personal definition, but one of the entire Open Source community:
The source code is free to use for your *own* project, which includes its own name and resources. Trying to steal the resources of another project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
If Ver, Jihan, or the other bad actors pushing this BCH (and many other) scams had the slightest interest in actual competition, they'd have made a legitimate altcoin by now. 
They have neither the technical knowhow, nor the slightest interest.  Hence the constant line of hostile takeover attempts they are guilty of.  XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCH, 2x... all attempting to steal the name, blockchain and other resources of another project they have absolutely no claim to.
That destructive behavior in itself earns them all the shunning they get from legitimate Crypto &amp; Open Source aficionados.  Not to mention the absolute disaster that their code base is. None of their  scams have any value as cryptocurrencies, just get-rich-quick scams.
Ver, Jihan, and their corrupt corporate backers make it their business to dupe people out of their hard earned money.

@_date: 2017-11-05 13:13:15
The problem is not among bitcoin devs.  
The problem is unscrupulous outsiders attacking Bitcoin, Crypto and Open Source.  Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have never contributed anything to the Bitcoin project. They only push get-rich-quick scams trying to steal its name and reputation.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:35:15
The 2x gangsters are no part of Bitcoin.  It is not in any way theirs. They have no claim to the name of any of the project's resources.
They have only attacked it, and the Bitcoin and Open Source communities.  
To your metaphor.. it's like they made a cheap knockoff and tried to sell it as the bona fide article.  Not even "like", that is *exactly* what they have attempted, not only with the 2x scam either...
We've seen so many hostile takeover attempts / scams:  XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, 2x, etc...
It will not be the last of their hostile takeover attempts. They are destructive imitations.  None of them are Bitcoin.
They are not even legitimate altcoins, and in no way "forks".   Trying to steal the name and reputation of another project is shady, shady business. Discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Cryptocurrency.
That's as far as the "car crash" metaphor goes.  2x is a fake.  It would have been good to see it crumple.  
Still, good if they have given up on this 2x scam. It was DOA anyway. They don't even have a dev team. Nobody in their right mind is going to trust Jihan and his band of disreputable mining outfits with anything of worth. Not unless they are in on the scam themselves. 
There are plenty of actually trustworthy mining outfits and they have been supporting Bitcoin all along.  Now that SegWit is activated, it's time to get on with safe and sane scaling tech it opens the door for!
Such "Big Blocks NOW!" crap from gangsters such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co is just more propaganda, and again, they are no part of Bitcoin.

/btc is owned and run by gangsters like Ver, and it is used as a launching ground for propaganda pushing their get-rich-quick schemes.
Part of that is the absurd propaganda that this sub somehow censors anything.  Putting spam in the bin is good moderation, and there's even very little of that going on.

They're doing just fine. 
Who you really mean are ones that CAN'T afford it, and they should be stressed out.
All they have to do is sell me their Bitcoin.  ;)  Let them invest in something less lucrative and safe.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:02:53
They want complete control of Bitcoin.
What these yahoos don't realize is, if their attacks ever succeeded, Bitcoin would be dead. 
They only have ONE dev behind the 2x scam. It's a huge joke. 
Still, they try, and try and try. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:33:12
Willy nilly increasing max block size is just what scam artists like Jihan, Ver &amp; co have been pushing all along, and have been denied again, and again for damn good reason.
Handing shady miners even more centralization would be insanity. There is absolutely no need to even discuss it now that SegWit has been activated.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:04:36
There is no fallout.  We've seen pump n dump on so many scams from Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
Such flashes in the pan have to do with their propaganda (which you are repeating), not anything of actual real-world value.
BCH is useless as an altcoin and has no future.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:58:20
Yup, bitstamp is solid.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:36:41
Showing disdain for a company supporting scams like 2x is a good thing.
The companies that signed on to that attack have outed themselves as untrustworthy.  Not doing business with them is *good* for Bitcoin, and Crypto in general.
Longevity and usefulness are the goal for Bitcoin,
not get-rich-quick schemes like bCash, Classic, Unlimited, 2x &amp; so many other scams.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:29:04
Absolutely false.
The scam artists behind 2x, BTC, so many others before,
have now been forced to stop blocking Bitcoin Progress.  SegWit, and all the exciting scaling tech it brings, is now being implemented.
Nobody in their right mind is going to go over to a coin controlled by the very gangsters that have been blocking progress for so long, and spamming the blockchain with garbage to increase fees.
That would be absolutely insane.   BCH has no technical value as an altcoin.  Its handfull of incompetent devs, completely under corrupt corporate control, are not worth any trust.
This latest pump-n-dump scam (bch) will be over before we know it.  
@_date: 2015-08-14 00:01:38
He's right though. Real bitcoin users run full nodes.
You're useful n all to your bitcoin cause, but you still have not yet gone that extra mile.
So yah, you're still just a tourist, not a true user.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:57:05
The only thing "vitriolic" we're talking about is abusive behavior.
Trying to steal the resources of another project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
Gangsters such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, and their supporters, deserve all the disdain they receive for constantly staging such attacks. 
Don't expect to receive a warm welcome in any legit crypto forum when you repeat their disinformation and propaganda supporting such.
There is a LONG line of such attacks.  Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, bCash... there is a huge amount of debunking and explanation done whenever such scams are pushed in legit Crypto forums like this one, all over the web.
So, your idea that it is "without anything backing them up" is completely false, you see?
You are a bystander, your opinion on BCH or any of the other scams from Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. is pretty much irrelevant.
Lurk some more.  Nobody stays at zero knowledge forever. Go through some older threads on the subject of the scams I listed above. They are chock full of technology and information on just why bCash &amp; the others are scams.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:26:13
Nobody that values their reputation would touch Ver or his scams with a 10 foot pole.
That's why he can only attract incompetents, such as the handful of jokers working this  BCH scam.
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:28:21
Not wise to have "life changing" sums invested in cryptocurrency.
Anyone that has invested millions has many, many more millions.
Don't invest more than you are prepared to lose.  This is still good advice.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:25:06
No, there are plenty of hostile takeover attempts from gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.  Pretenders that have no claim to the name Bitcoin.
Their scams are not legitimate cryptocurrencies, nor even forks.  The tiny handful of devs they can attract are as incompetent and shady as they are.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCH, 2x... "they" have nothing to do with Bitcoin, except their constant attacks against it.
And in the face of all such shady bad actors try to do against it, 
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:07:38
Posting simple facts, pointing out scam artists for what they are,
is not hate. It is a public service.  
Ver, Jihan &amp; Co can fool some Crypto newbies with their scams, but the more actual info is out there, the less damage such bad actors can do.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:28:28
None of the ridiculous propaganda and disinformation pumping the 2x scam, nor the BCH scam, make any sense.
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust anything of worth to a handful of incompetent devs under corrupt corporate control.
BCH has no value as an altcoin, and no future.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:21:26
BCH makes zero sense, except as yet another pump-n-dump scam.  That's all Ver produces.
He has only a tiny handful of incompetent devs working on that "project", that are just as shady as he is.
BCH has no value as a legit cryptocurrency whatsoever. Nobody that knows the first thing would use it as such.  
All it's good for is as the get-rich-quick scheme that it is.
You're discussing your ridiculous propaganda right now.  Such disinformation is allowed to be constantly spewed here, because the mods are extremely tolerant.
Personally, I'd axe every mention of promoting such scams as legit business opportunities. It's just trying to fool newbies out of their money.
Your ridiculous comment will stay there, but don't be surprised if you don't receive a warm welcome on legit crypto forums for supporting attacks and hostile takeover attempts.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:34:46
Please stop using the phrase "1x".  It lends legitimacy to the 2x scam..
There is no 1x, there is only Bitcoin.
If the gangsters behind 2x were successful in their attack, Bitcoin would cease to exist.
They won't be, of course.  Nobody in their right mind is going to trust these yahoos with anything of value, unless they're pumping the 2x scam themselves.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:10:26


Bitcoin *is* just Bitcoin.
Scams like 2x, bCash, btc1, Classic, Unlimited, etc, are hostile takeover attempts.  They have nothing to do with the Bitcoin project.
They have zero claim to the name or any other resources of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:47:22
Idiots?  Investing anything of value in a hostile takeover attempt is idiotic.  Bcash has no credibility. It is an attempt to steal the resources of another already established project.
This kind of shady business is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just crypto. 
Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, and their get-rich-quick schemes deserve all the disdain they receive. Take your promotion of such scams back to /btc where they are welcome. Nobody here is buying the snake oil.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:15:22
A hard fork is either done by the Bitcoin dev team,
or a legitimate altcoin with its own name and blockchain.
2x is nothing more than a scam. They have no dev team, or legitimacy. It is neither a fork, nor an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:33:06
No, because only shady bad actors such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, and their supporters, push the ridiculous "Bit Blocks NOW!" propaganda.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:41:30
There is no "war",  what there is, is a long line of disinformation and propaganda pushing get-rich-quick schemes from Ver, Jihan &amp; Co. 
Every scam they promote is accompanied with huge brigades of abuse and astroturfing, not just here, but other legit Crypto forums all over the web as well. :(
BCH and the other scams before it cost innocent people their hard earned money. They have no technical value as Cryptocurrency, just pump-n-dump schemes.
You are only talking about yourself, and the cesspools of disinformation that Ver pays to promote his scams.  (hi /btc)
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:12:43
Ver is nothing but a infamous scam artist. He has consistently tried hostile takeover attempts such as Classic, Unlimited, BCH... and been mixed up in Jihan's scams btc1, 2x. 
He pushes them on his scam website bitcoin.COM (it has nothing to do with Bitcoin whatsoever, just his scamcoin).
We've seen his shenanigans many times before, along with a flood of disinformation and propaganda pushing his get-rich-quick scams.
Here's something from back when Unlimited was paluging legit crypto forums all over the web (this sub included), just like his latest BCH is now:
It has been known for a long time that this latest scam of Roger Ver's (xt, classic, now unlimited) have no technological value.
This latest attempt, Unlimited coin, is written by a handful of completely incompetent "devs", as has been abundantly demonstrated, again and again! The links below are *just a beginning*.
The Bitcoin Community is well aware, and nobody in their right mind will turn Bitcoin over to this snake oil salesman Ver and his ridiculously broken software teams. Not to mention the shady mining concerns (hello Jihan &amp; Co) that supported it before it became so blatantly obvious that it was Dead On Arrival.
Some background on the dangers of this Unlimited nonsense:
[These three well written articles by Aaron van Wirdum explain BU's 'Emergent Consensus' (spoiler alert - it's got issues)](
Even more damning, a complete rundown of the blatant, wilful scam that is Unlimited:
Thanks to for this excellent writeup, and plethora of linked sources:
[**The Astounding Incompetence, Negligence, and Dishonesty of the Bitcoin Unlimited Developers**](
As if that was not enough!  (thanks to for the excellent writeup and links.)
Add to this the [Damning evidence on how Bitcoin Unlimited pays shills.]( 
Roger Ver has no shred of integrity, honesty or trustworthiness in him. He and his cohorts such as Jihan &amp; Co are shunned with extreme prejudice by the Bitcoin and Crypto community, as well as Open Source in general, for for their destructive practices.
Just as his latest hijacking attempt, Unlimited is, Jihan's 2x hijack attempt is, 
as well as the cesspools of disinformation and propaganda they use to organize their paid brigading (hello /btc).
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:07:56
Listen to these liars. As if their 2x scam had anything to do with segwit. The threat of a UASF made them stop blocking progress. 
These gangsters have never been part of the Bitcoin community. Quite the opposite, attacking it again and again. 
Good riddance. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:30:55
Roger Ver is well known for using paid shills to push his scams. :(
We've seen it all too man times before.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, bCash, 2x... Every such hostile takeover attempt is punctuated by a surge in propaganda and disinformation pushing them. 
This brigading is seen all over the internet in legit Crypto forums like this one. It is a cancer, as are their projects like Bcash.
Fortunately, such scams are getting easier and easier to spot.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:48:26
you cannot in any way compare SegWit to the technically worthless scams Jihan, Ver &amp; Co constantly push.
There is no comparison to the handfull of incompetent devs they can get to work for them, 
to the huge, international, and extremely knowledgeable dev team that makes up the Open Source Bitcoin project.
Even just trying this age-old, so often debunked lie that Bitcoin is somehow run by a centralized agency,
shows your support for the *actually* centralized scams that gangsters behind such scams as:
 XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCH, 2x... constantly push.   
None of them have done anything to support Bitcoin, Crypto or Open Source.  Quite the opposite! They consistently spit in the face of those projects, communities and miners that support good projects.
Fully controlled by corrupt corporate interests, with no technical worth.  The tiny handful of incompetent programmers Jihan, Ver &amp; Co can get to work on those scams have shown themselves to be just as shady as their empoyers.  The scams listed above are neither altcoins, forks nor in any way legit cryptocurrencies.
BCH is completely useless as a cryptocurrency.  If you don't understand this, you need to learn the basics of how cryptocurrency works, especially Bitcoin, as well as Open Source.
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust an incompetent dev team completely under corrupt corporate control with anything of real value. The only thing that pump-n-dump scheme is good for is just that, dump it at the highest price possible.  
That is its only goal, and that of the scams before it.  If they were at all interested in actual, bona fide competition, they'd make a legit altcoin, with its own name and blockchain.  They are not capable of such, hence their constant attempts to steal the good name and reputation of another project that *actually* works.
BTC, and all the scams these yahoos have pushed before it, and assuredly in the future, are nothing but get-rich-quick scams.  They've proven this again, and again.
And all the while, Bitcoin, with its huge and knowledgeable dev team, massive support from trustworthy miners, and enormous community,  is chugging right along.  :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:34:19
The incompetent handful of devs Ver has working for him do though.
BCH has no worth as a bona fide altcoin.  
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:11:31
Shady gangsters attacking Bitcoin with one scam after the next are no part of the community. 
They are directly attacking it.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:10:26
A group of untrustworthy miners and big business corporate actors are not part of "the community".  They make it their business to *attack* (2x being the latest incarnation) the Bitcoin community. As well as Crypto and Open source in general .
These gangsters are seeking pure profit, simple as that. 
The Bitcoin community is after longevity and stability. Exactly the opposite.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:00:28


Nobody that values their reputation will touch Ver with a 10 foot pole.  He can't attract anything like you're describing.
BCH and his other scams have no technical value.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:32:01
Which is why the BCH scam, as with so many before it, has no future.
There will be more such hostile takeover attempts. Fortunately they are getting easier to spot.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:54:00


This is, indeed, the level of lies and propaganda That Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are guilty of.  :(
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:52:45
BCH has nothing to do with Bitcoin.  There is no "old and new".
There is Bitcoin,  and there are scams like bCash.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:16:10
Dude, take your propaganda back to /btc where it is welcome.
Shady gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, and their scams like 2x, BCH, are not "the Market".
The only thing wrong with this entire scenario is their hostile attacks, against Bitcoin, Crypto and Open Source.
The Market has denied them their scam attempts again and again. BCH is no different.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:59:49
Nobody in their right mind is going to actually use a scam like bcash for anything important.
The tiny handful of incompetent devs working on it are fully under Ver's corrupt corporate control.  It has no future.
It can't even be called a legitimate altcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:33:56
Any theoretical "good" that scam artist might have done is completely, totally negated by later decades of his destructive attacks against Open Source, Crypto, and specifically Bitcoin.
The scam artist has zero integrity. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:46:50
BCH is no competition.  That joke of a codebase only has a handful of incompetent devs working on it, and they are completely under the control of the gangsters pushing the scam.
It has no real-world value, or future.
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:37:09
2x scammers wanted to crash Bitcoin. 
Proving they cannot would be good. 
It is not their car, that's the point. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:02:40
Yes,  more shady disinformation from shady bad actors behind a long chain of hostile takeover attempts.
"Classic" is as much a scam as BCH, Unlimited, and so many others. :/
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:18:37
The 2x scammers are no part of Bitcoin, community or otherwise. Never were. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:13:39
BCH is just one in a long line of get-rich-quick schemes of his.  XT, Classic, Unlimited.  He's been mixed up in Jihan's scams too; btc1, 2x.
He's well known for using paid shills to push his get-rich-quick schemes.  
He only has a handful of incompetent devs working for him. BCH has no technical value, nor real world value as an altcoin.
Ver has zero credibility or integrity. Sketchy is putting it nicely.
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:30:23
Then probably not a good idea to invest life changing sums in Crypto.
Anyone investing millions has millions to risk, if they're smart.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:43:56
Exactly.  Ver uses his .com site to promote every scam he launches.  BTC is just the latest in a long line.
He doesn't even have a legitimate "side", just hostile takeover attempts, lies and propaganda.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:52:37
Bitcoin is doing just fine. Espeically considering how it is constatly under attack, and has had progress blocked for so long by shady gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
Now that they have been forced to allow Segwit to activate, the future looks bright ahead.
The problem has been those assholes, not Bitcoin, its dev team, community or trustworthy miners.
If you're not happy about fees, blame the ones responsible.  The same ones preading "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda, in support of their scams like 2x, bcash, unlimited, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:20:44
Another scam crashing and burning is a good thing. 
2x is not "our car". It belongs to gangsters attacking Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:51:20
Such shady behavior, trying to steal the resources of an already established project, is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
Indeed, gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. have earned all the disdain that Open Source, Crypto and Bitcoin communities have for them.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:57:01
Jihan, Ver and their cronies have zero interest in legitimate competition.
If they did, they would make a legitimate altcoin, with its own name and blockchain.  They cannot, even if they wanted to.
So, the constant and consistent hostile takeover attempts.  
None of their scams are useful as a legit cryptocurrency. The only devs they can get to work for them are a handful of incompetents that are just as corrupt and shady as they are.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:15:37
Oh I, and for sure others, are well aware of your posting history. 
Blatantly anti-bitcoin.  none of it either accurate, nor correct.
Disinformation and propaganda... and here we see the example: 
yet another ineffectual character assassination attempt in lieu of honest discussion.
Trying some ridiculous shaming attempt based on a user name... or your previous one, based on nothing at all, only show you have nothing constructive to say.  And are very prolific at it btw.   
There is no "censorship" in this forum.  It takes some off the wall abuse, or blatant, well known propaganda / disinformation to get a post deleted.
At that point, it is very well deserved.   Legit crypto forums all over the web are plagued with constant brigading of bullshit every time Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. push another scam.  
Including here, and tying to say anyone is unjustly "encored" for pushing such is just more propaganda.
We've seen this with so many hostile takeover attempts. BCH is only the latest.  
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, Bcash, 2x...  zero worth technologically and run by corrupt gangsters.  
Still the huge amount of disinformation pushing such scams is mostly left to stay on this forum. 
Saying there is any unjust moderation in this sub is absurd.  If anything, the mods here are tolerant to a fault.
I'd axe any such scams from such abusive bad actors.   You pushing such lies included.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:49:52
What are you talking about?  There is all kinds of propaganda and disinformation posted supporting the bch scam, and the 2x scam, and so many others before it.

Calling out the gangsters behind hostile takeover attempts (hi Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.) is a good thing.  Debunking their blatant propaganda and disinformation brigades is also.

Not so sure about that. There are ways to influence people here on reddit that we do need to watch out for. 
Zealous moderation is good. If it was OVERzelous?  I suppose that's up to each individual too. I'd say that was working as it should be.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:38:44
It's not just on reddit.  Legit crypto forums all over the web suffer from Ver &amp; Co's paid shills.  Every hostile takeover attempt they push is punctuated with a huge brigade of abusive lies, disinformation, and propaganda. 
/btc is just one of their staging grounds for such social media attacks.
We've seen it all too often, pushing scams like  XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, BCH, etc...
Thankfully, the scams are getting easier and easier to spot,
and Bitcoin is still doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:07:23
Complete and total bullshit.  That is just more baseless propaganda.
The mods here are almost tolerant to a fault. 
We are subjected to all manner of spam, disinformation, propaganda (as yours above) and outright lies supporting get-rich-quick scams such as x2. 
Unless someone steps WAY over the line, the comments remain. It takes  a LOT of abuse to deserve a ban.  At that point that's exactly what it is too, deserved.

BCH can't even be called a legit fork, nor altcoin.
It is simply another in a long line of (failed) hostile takeover attempts.
It has no technical worth, nor real-world value.
The gangsters behind the scam can't pump it indefinitely. Once they stop, that's that.
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:19:38
It is an alt coin though.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:13:32
So, some shady mining outfits (hi Jihan) and corrupt corporate types (hi Ver) are spamming the Blockchain with garbage, creating high fees.
And your solution to this is for everyone to use THEIR scamcoin instead?  LOL  you do realize how absolutely insane that would be, don't you?
This latest pump-n-dump scam, BCH will be over soon. We've seen this crap far too often to think it will be permanent at all.
BCH has no technical value as an altcoin, jsut like so many in a long line of such hostile takeover attempts before it. It has no future.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:38:18
2x scam wasn't supported by Bitcoin or its community.
You're suggesting we invite kidnappers to dinner after their malicious schemes fell through. 
There can be no trust for Jihan and his goons, nor the corrupt companies behind the 2x attack. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:24:50
You've got to be kidding. Nothing could be further from the truth.
/btc has historically promoted every scam to come down the line.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, bCash....
Speaking out the truth about those, and the scam site bitcoin.COM will not only often be removed, it's likely to get you banned on /btc.
The sub is a cesspool of disinformation and propaganda. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:46:49
BCH has zero merit.  Technically or morally. 
There are no two "sides".  What there is is Bitcoin,
and there are shady gangsters trying to attack it. (BCH, 2x, btc1)
There is no comparing them. 
BCH has a handful of incompetent devs under Ver's control. It is worthless as an actual cryptocurrency.  It has no future.
Willy nilly increasing block size only encourages even further mining power centralization. This is why gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co push their Big Blocks NOW! propaganda so hard.
(wile at the same time spamming the blockchain with garbage to increase fees)
Again, BCH is just another in a long line of scams. We've seen it so many times before. 
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:12:57
It is totally Roger Ver's project.  The tiny handful of incompetent devs working on it are completely under his corrupt corporate control.

bCash is fully run and owned by Ver &amp; his goons. The handful of incompetent devs working on it are fully under his control.
Bitcoin has a HUGE, international dev team, massive community, not to mention the trustworthy miners that have backed it all along.
bCash won't last longer than the money being pumped into the scam.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:35:35
Exactly.  It is owned and run by Ver, used exclusively to push his scams. BCH is only the latest.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:42:29
There was never a split.  There was a bunch of propaganda and disinformation pushed in support of the 2x scam. 
Bcash is no different. It has no technical value. The same scam artists are just up to their same old tricks, pumping their latest scam and spreading FUD.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:00:21
Oh god, what has Ver's handful of incompetent devs hacked together THIS time?
This is the same group of incompetents that couldn't even figure out how to increase max block size.  
Nothing they produce is of any worth except for the pump-n-dump scam that BCH is.

@_date: 2017-11-12 11:20:12

Drop in the bucket.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:17:30
Riiiiight bud.  
Nobody in their right mind is going to use Ver's BCH scam for anything important.
It is of no technical value as an altcoin. The only thing it is good for is to dump when it can be traded...  well, and of course as the pump-n-dump scam it is for gangsters like Ver.
There are what, 3 or so devs working on it, under corrupt corporate control.  They have proven to be completely incompetent too.
Jihan, Ver and Co. have been blocking Bitcoin progress all along,  and now they are not. SegWit and safe and sane scaling can move forward.

Ver is well known for such shady behavior.  Trying to steal the name and other resources of another project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.  And for damn good reason. 
He uses his scam .com site to push every hostile takeover attempt he launches.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, BCH is just the latest.  He's mixed up in Jihans scams too,  btc1, 2x, etc.  :(
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:41:28
Full nodes verify transactions.  That's not a loophole bud, that's just how Bitcoin works.
You know, it sounds like you've been hanging out with people pushing Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.'s scams.  
I'd suggest staying away from cesspools of disinformation like /btc.  And if you insist on listening to them, at least stop repeating their disinformation and propaganda here.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:36:46
No, BCH has nothing to do with Bitcoin whatsoever.  
Attempting to steal the resources of another project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
If they wanted a legitimate altcoin, they'd have their own name and blockchain. Healthy competition is very welcome.
Jihan, Ver &amp; Co not only have zero interest in such, they lack the capability.  Hence their constant hostile takeover attempts, and rediuclous "Big Blockjs NOW!" propaganda.
They deserve every bit of disdain they receive for such destructive behavior.
willy nilly increasing block size would even further mining power centralization. Exactly what such shady gangsters want.  And why it has been denied them, agian and again.
Until the scaling tech that SegWit brings with it has been explored, there is no legit reason to talk about block size.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:09:37
The market fully has shown consensus, again and again, every time corporate gangsters like Ver, and unscrupulous miners like Jihan stage another hostile takeover attempt.
We've seen this half a dozen times in as many years.
2x, like bch, and so many other scams before it from these yahoos, never had a chance of reaching consensus. 
They aren't even legitimate altcoins, nor forks. They have no dev team to speak of.  The handful of incompetents that will work for these gangsters... nobody is actually going to trust them with anything important.
Once they stop pumping BCH, it will go like the rest.  &gt;poof&lt;
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:48:02
The centrally controlled scam that is Bcash is in no way superior to any legitimate altcoin, least of all Bitcoin.
Intellect tells us that Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are simply up to their old tricks. This is nothing new. We've seen their hostile takeover attempts too many times to buy the snake oil.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:35:44
No, the mods here are very tollerant.  We see all kinds of disinformation and propaganda pushing the BCH scam, and other such scams before it.
They get debunked again and again, but unless someone steps WAY over the line into downright abuse, the comments stay.
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:26:26
A very select group of unscrupulous miners.
Jihan and his goons to be exact.
There are plenty of trustworthy mining outfits.  Don't make the mistake of lumping them all together.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:44:07
BCH is Ver's baby.  He only has a handful of incompetent devs working on the project.  He's also well known for using paid shills to push such scams. BCH is only the latest in a long line of them.
every time he and his cronies (hi Jihan) launches another hostile takeover attempt, legit crypto forums are inundated with blatant disinformation and propaganda pushing them, and attacking crypto.
We've seen this pattern again, and again.  It's very obvious to spot now.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:54:12
bCash of course. 
That's what the rediculous propaganda Kings is pushing is about.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:48:51
His latest BCH scam has no claim to the Bitcoin name.
It also has no worth as a legit altocoin.  The tiny handful of incompetent  devs that will work for him have proven themselves to be just as shady as he is.  
They couldn't even figure out how to increase max block size for pete's sake!
Very is very well known for spending HUGE sums of money to scam Crypto newbies.  :(  It seems to be somewhat lucrative for him, as he's constantly pushing one pump-n-dump scheme after another.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:48:34
The mods here are almost tolerant to a fault. You have to step WAY over the line to have a comment removed, let alone a suspension or ban.
Take your anti-bitcoin propaganda back to /btc where it belongs. btw, /btc mods will and do censor actual information about Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's scams at the drop of a hat.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:45:30
We see such blatant propaganda and disinformation with every scam Ver, Jihan &amp; Co push.   :(
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:15:44
The entire Bitcoin dev team, trustworthy miners and community have been behind SegWit for months and months.
The only ones not wanting it are a few unscrupulous mining outfits (hi Jihan) and corrupt corporate types (Ver &amp; Co.).
Now that they have been forced to stop blocking Bitcoin progress (thanks to the UASF threat), work can continue.
If you need to blame someone for holding things up, look to the gangsters behind scams such as Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, bCash, etc...
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:01:56
It is a fork of Bitcoin. As long as Bitcoin continues, then no, it is not bitcoin, it is a competing coin that is hijacking Bitcoin's technology.
If it is truly the future direction of bitcoin itself, then it is simply bitcoin, not a fork of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-12 23:30:14
In this context, an accurate social commentary.
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:32:56
Storage space isn't even the biggest problem either.
Bandwidth to push ridiculously large blocks is expensive. This puts already too large mining outfits at a huge advantage. Bad for any crypto.
BCH, and every scam Ver has come up with before it, are fatally flawed. None of them are worth anything as cryptocurrencies, only get-rich-quick schemes.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:12:10
Exactly.  Binning spam is good moderation, not censorship.
The mods here are tolerant almost to a fault.  
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:51:07
BCH has no value as a bona fide altcoin.  Ver only has a small dev team working for him, and they've show themselves to be laughably incompetent, again and again.
The only thing his scams are good for is pump-n-dump. 
It would be funny if he didn't cost innocent people their hard earned money and spread so much destructive disinformation and propaganda.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:27:25
There is nothing wrong with that link.  
Calling out scam artists like Ver, and their shady tactics, is a public service. 
If the admins did anything to this sub for telling the truth, there would be a huge media backlash. The admins won't touch that with a 10 foot pole.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:43:13
No, shady gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; co are simply running another hostile takeover attempt.  We've seen this many, many times before.  
Their scamcoin has no value of its own.  Hardly a dev team to speak of, and only shady bad actors backing it.
BCH is completely centralized. There is zero "spectrum" there.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:42:44
Unsourced supposed "leaks" from a sub that is well known for promoting every scam that has come down the line.
Take that propaganda back to /btc where it came from.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:55:16
Ver is well known for using paid shills to promote his scams.
/btc is one of his launching grounds for destructive propaganda brigades that target legit crypto forums all over the web, including this one.
Some crypto newbies are unfortunately fooled, at least for a time. :(  The more awareness the better about scams like Unlimited, Classic, btc1, 2x, bCash, etc...
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:38:32
Just another in a LONG line of scams from gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:08:58
heh,  not many remember, but, the first [terminals]( printed on paper.
Or the long gone days of 300baud modems, when you could read text faster than it scrolled down the terminal screen.
Many sleepless nights of such could induce psychosis.  When them cobwebs start spinning into the peripheral vision...  
Such a state is, indeed, "terminal psychosis". Fortunately, it's rarely deadly. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:58:09
"classic" is as much of a scam as so many other pretenders.
Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, bCash... all birds of a feather.
They have nothing to do with Bticoin except they are destructive takeover attempts against it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:59:10
The tiny dev team of incompetents Ver has working for him couldn't even figure out how to increase max block size.
It shows the level of "programmers" he is able to attract.  Who they are specifically isn't important. That they are as shady as he is, is.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:49:36
Ver has had the chance to do this with the half dozen other scams he's run.  He won't risk it.
Even when Jihan's goons were signalling 2x, they still mined Bitcoin.  It is where the money is.
BCH has no use as an actual cryptocurrency.  It's just another pump-n-dump scam.  
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:48:45
Maybe you should read up on what abusive, monopolistic practices are. 
Then you'd realize what Bill and his corrupt corporation are guilty of.

We've heard this propaganda and disinformation so many times before.  
Your "questions" aka spam, have been answered, and ridiculous disinformation campaigns debunked, again and again.
Binning spam is not censorship. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:49:48
Exactly that kind of disinformation and propaganda is what we're talking about.  
Total bullshit pushed by the likes of Ver &amp; Co.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:03:45
"I don't think" is not a valid assertion when you admit yourself you are a bystander with no real knowledge.
On what, exactly, are you basing this assertion?  
I strongly suggest you stop hanging out in /btc and other such cesspools of disinformation.
That is, if you honestly want to learn the tech of Open Source, Crypto and Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:21:16
So your answer is, instead of supporting slow, steady, sustainable scaling, 
to throw in with scam artists like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, and their scams.
No thanks, we've all seen this "argument" before. Nobody is buying their "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:30:47


this is absolutely ridiculous.  It could be reasonably argued that 1MB is already too big.
at 32mb the vast majority of the world wouldn't have a chance to run a full node, let alone mine.
You've been listening to the disinformation brigade over at /btc.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:41:02
None of Ver's scams have any technical merit as legit altcoins. The tiny handful of incompetent devs he can get to work for him have proven  incapable of providing anything approaching a legit Cryptocurrency.
BCH is just the latest in a long line of his hostile takeover attempts.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:24:59
Those people are either in on his scams, or have sadly been duped by them.
There is no technological value in any of his get rich quick schemes... and there have been a long line of them, except as corrupt pump-n-dump scams.
The technical merits of the crap he pushes have been debunked again, and again.

Without a blockchain you don't have a cryptocurrency, you have a bank.
@_date: 2016-11-27 20:26:43
Why do we always hear this kind of propaganda asserted, with zero actual reasons to back it up?
Changing bitcoin simply to benefit miners is not any kind of plan. Miner's concerns can never take precedence over the longevity and usefulness of a cryptocurrency.
No, there is no good reason to will-nilly increase max block size (unless you ask the get-rich-quick scam-artists that would love make a quick buck, or outright co-opt, even destroy bitcoin). 
Very careful consideration of the very real danger such a thing brings with it, and protection against that danger, are mandatory. For bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:22:26
Such propaganda and disinformation is spread with every new scam Ver stages. We've seen it all too often.  Classic, Unlimited, and he was involved with Jihan in the btc1 &amp; 2x scams.
It's all become quite boring.  It is sad that they fool some crypto newbies, but sooner or later it becomes obvious to all what they're attempting.
BCH has a handful of incompetent devs fully under Ver's corrupt corporate control. It has no value as a real cryptocurrency. It is just another pump-n-dump scheme.
This, too, shall pass.  Such shady gangsters will try again, but their shenanigans are becoming easier and easier to spot, as well as the blatant propaganda they pay for to promote them.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:20:08
About his Unlimited scam he was pushing earlier this year...
With BCH his methods have gotten even more destructive:
It has been known for a long time that this latest scam of Roger Ver's (xt, classic, now unlimited) have no technological value.
This latest attempt, Unlimited coin, is written by a handful of completely incompetent "devs", as has been abundantly demonstrated, again and again! The links below are *just a beginning*.
The Bitcoin Community is well aware, and nobody in their right mind will turn Bitcoin over to this snake oil salesman Ver and his ridiculously broken software teams. Not to mention the shady mining concerns (hello Jihan &amp; Co) that supported it before it became so blatantly obvious that it was Dead On Arrival.
Some background on the dangers of this Unlimited nonsense:
[These three well written articles by Aaron van Wirdum explain BU's 'Emergent Consensus' (spoiler alert - it's got issues)](
Even more damning, a complete rundown of the blatant, wilful scam that is Unlimited:
Thanks to for this excellent writeup, and plethora of linked sources:
[**The Astounding Incompetence, Negligence, and Dishonesty of the Bitcoin Unlimited Developers**](
As if that was not enough!  (thanks to for the excellent writeup and links.)
Add to this the [Damning evidence on how Bitcoin Unlimited pays shills.]( 
Roger Ver has no shred of integrity, honesty or trustworthiness in him. He and his cohorts such as Jihan &amp; Co are shunned with extreme prejudice by the Bitcoin and Crypto community, as well as Open Source in general, for for their destructive practices.
Just as his latest hijacking attempt, Unlimited is, Jihan's 2x hijack attempt is, 
as well as the cesspools of disinformation and propaganda they use to organize their paid brigading (hello /btc).
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:26:42
Waste of ink.  BCH won't be around long enough for such to be useful.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:43:08
BCash is fully Roger Ver's project.  The tiny handful of incompetent and untrustworthy devs working on it (all he can attract to his scams) are fully under his employ and power.
Ver is also well known for using paid shills to push his scams. There is no "conflating",  there is simply telling the truth of the matter.
Anyone that is not aware of what BCash / BCH is, and how it is centrally controlled by Ver &amp; Co, need to know it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:45:19
Your question is a non-sequitor.  It makes zero sense.
With SegWit now finally free to move forward, there is zero reason to even discuss block size, until all the safe and sane scaling methods it allows are explored.
The only people that keep harping on some ridiculous "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda are the same disreputable mining outfits (hi Jihan) and corrupt corporate bad actors (hi Ver) that would use it purely for their own greed.
Trustworthy miners (there are many) do oppose willy-nilly increasing block size. The Bitcoin communtiy and devs as well, for damn good reason.
Such unscrupulous block size increases would further the threat of mining centralization that allowed Jihan and his goons to block progress so long.  No dice, ain't gonna happen.
Their schemes have been denied them again, and again, and will continue to be.
Putting down unscrupulous, destructive, hostile behavior (such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are guilty of) is necessary and productive.  Their actions are the opposite of productive, unless you're in on their scams. Even then it's a losing game. They've been thwarted in every hostile takeover they've tried up until now. The death of 2x was pre-programmed. bCash is no different.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:27:47
Better to dump the BCH scamcoin while it's still worth something.
It won't last long.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:11:05
We see these propaganda campaigns all over the web whenever Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are pushing another scam. :/
Ver is well known for using paid shills.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:47:42
Much much better to do it slowly, carefully, safely.
Willy-nilly increasing block size would encourage even more mining power centralization. That's why gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co keep pushing their "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda.
Now that they have stopped blocking progress, SegWit and all the exciting scaling tech it allows can move forward.  
Turning over Bitcoin to the very gangsters that are constantly attacking it is no solution whatsoever.  We just need to be patient.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:10:06
The only devs gangsters like Ver can get to work for him are just as sleazy as he is.  The handful working on bCash are incompetents. 
Nobody in their right mind is going to use that scam for anything important.  It is in no way comparable to the functionality of Bitcoin. Once Ver &amp; Co. stop pumping their scam, that will be that.  
Add to that the shady, shady business of trying to steal the resources of an already established project.  Negative legitimacy. BCH can't even be called a real altcoin, let alone fork.  It is simply a hostile takeover attempt.
Every one of Ver's similar get-rich-quick schemes has failed so far. bCash will be no different.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:45:47
The scam artists behind bCash don't have infinite funds to pump it.
They'll stop at some point.  
Good opportunity  to acquire more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:16:12
If you want yet another centrally controlled payment method, there are credit cards, paypal and fiat.
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust a tiny handful of incompetent devs under Ver's corrupt corporate control. aka BCH. All it is good for is to dump as soon as exchanges will let you.
His BCH scam has no technical value as a cryptocurrency, and no future, just like his other get rich quick schemes and hostile takeover attempts before it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:42:30
Not in the least.  Bitcoin is contributed to by a HUGE list of devs from around the world.  
Blockstream does not have anything to do with it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:51:03
There is only one Open Source Bitcoin project.
Trying to steal the resources of an established project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
He (Roger Ver) is constantly trying to scam people out of their money with such hostile behavior.  Neither he, nor his projects have *anything* to do with Bitcoin, except for the hostile takeover attempts he constantly stages against it.
He has a "right" to do such?  Open Source, Crypto and Bitcoin communities, as well as trustworthy mining outfits, have the right to fully shun him, and his cronies, for such destructive, abusive behavior. As they have all along, for damn good reason.
Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, bCash... we've seen a long line of such scams over the years.  None of them are legitimate altcoins, nor forks. They are hostile takeover attempts.
Nobody in their right mind would invest anything of worth into such scams, or the tiny handful of incompetent devs under his control. Not unless they've been fooled by his propaganda, or are in on the scam themselves.
His behavior, and that of Jihan and his unscrupulous mining outfits, and the corrupt bankers and corporate gangsters they attract, are the exact opposite of "civilized".
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:34:02
Ver is well known for a LONG line of such scams. BCH is only the latest.  We've seen it all before, and discussed and debunked them as having no value as legit cryptocurrencies.
There is a TON of very good technical information on this, and other legit crypto forums.  
The high fees are mostly seen when a band of shady miners under Jihan's control are spamming the Bitcoin blockchain with garbage blocks.  
It's happened again and again that when they start concentrating on a new scam that nonsense peters out and the mempool clears very rapidly.
Also, it's very common knowledge that the same gangsters have been blocking Bitcoin progress for months and months.  With the recent threat of a UASF, they were forced to shape up or ship out.
Now SegWit has been irreversibly activated (no thanks to them) and all the exciting scaling tech it opens the door for can be explored.
There is no "counter argument", what there is, is a long line of hostile takeover attempts and "Big blocks NOW!" propaganda from such bad actors. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:15:12
The gangsters behind the 2x scam are no part of Bitcoin or its community. They've made it their business to attack it over and over. 
The strength of Bitcoin's community, dev team, and trustworthy miners supporting it have thwarted yet another hostile takeover attempt. 
The yahoos behind 2x will try again but such scams are getting easier and easier to spot. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:35:55


you mean scam artists Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, who you are constantly promoting. :/
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:10:26

Things will go on as usual. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:39:13
That is not an "opinion", it is supporting an outright hostile takeover attempt and scam (bCash).

1MB is pushing things as it is.  Not everyone has access to cheap, fast internet. 8MB would cut off a HUGE amount of people from running full nodes.
Not to mention the even further threat of mining power centralization it would cause.  This is exactly why shady gangsters such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co push their Big Blocks NO! propaganda so hard,
and why they have been denied such dangerous schemes again, and again.  
This latest BCH scam will be no different.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:37:12
BCash is nothing but a scam. The handful of incompetent devs Ver has are completely under his control.

First "centralization" in Crypto jargon has nothing to do with development. It refers to mining power and node distribution.
Second, the handful of incompetent devs, completely under Ver's control, coudln't even figure out how to change the max block size!
BCH is very much centralized under Ver's control, as is the joke of a "dev team" he has working for him.
His latest scam here has no technical value as an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:24:19
Who in their right mind is going to invest anything of worth in these 2x scam artists?  (unless they're in on the scam themselves anyway.)   They don't even have a dev team.

BCH is terrible for him financially, as well as all the other scams he's pushed over the years.  It seems it's all he can do anymore.
Nobody would every trust him to make a legit altcoin, 
so he concentrates on one hostile takeover attempt after another.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:12:34
The 2x scam has nothing to do with Bitcoin.  They only have one dev, and he's more interested in his own scamcoin.
2x is not even a legitimate altcoin or fork. It is a hostile takeover attempt with only unscrupulous corporations and some miners behind it.
It goes against everything Bitcoin and Open Source stand for.

"Classic" has zero to do with the Bitcoin project, except it is a hostile takeover attempt against Bitcoin.
"Classic" is completely, totally different from Bitcoin, that's just a simple fact.

No, raising public awareness of scams like Ver's is a public service and fully on par with best practices in any legit crypto forum.
/bitcoin is a serious crypto forum.  The members here are discouraged against any such shady behavior with extreme prejudice.  
Reporting destructive get-rich-quick scams like ver and his /btc pushes is in no way "brigading".  The admins encourage such reporting... so they say.
/btc are the ones that consistently brigade every scam that comes down the line.  We've seen it all too often. :(
Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, bCash... hostile takeover attempts that spit in the face of Open Source, Crypto, and specifically Bitcoin.  They are not only aimed at stealing the resources of another established project, but at scamming people out of their money. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:26:11

Bitcoin progress has been blocked by Jihan and his goon squad of gangster miners, and corrupt corporate gangsters like Ver &amp; Co.
Now they've been forced to stop that nonsense by the threat of a UASF, and progress can continue. 
SegWit has the support of the Bitcoin community, trustworthy miners, and of course Dev team.  
If you're going to blame someone, put it where it is deserved, the scam artists and their hostile takeover attempts (btc1, bcash, 2x, etc...) and their "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:35:52
Reporting it on Youtube would be the only logical thing.
This post is pointing out what a scam Ver's BCH is.  That is a public service.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:08:00
Well, the scam artists pumping bCash can't go on spending indefinitely.  
At some point they'll be forced to stop, and that will be that.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:24:42
BCash is just another in a long line of hostile takeover attempts.
It is run by unscrupulous scam artists (hi Jihan, hi Ver). They have neither the technical know-how to offer legit competition, nor any interest in such.
Hence their constant attempts to steal the name and other resources of an already well established Open Source project. Something that is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:29:49
There is no such thing as "1x".  There is only Bitcoin.
It is in no way comparable to the 2x scam, nor the bcash scam, which are controlled centrally by corrupt corporations.
Bitcoin is a bona fide cryptocurrency, the other two are hostile takeover attempts.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:06:37
BTC has a huge and very knowladgable dev team from around the world.
Ver's BCH scam has a handful of incompetents, under his control.
There is really no comparison whatsoever. Bcash has no real-world value as an actual altcoin.  It is simply a hostile takeover attempt.
One in a long line of them. None have succeeded. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:51:56
Why the hell are you saying things like "bitcoin is dead", and then describing the scam that bcash is?
What's with the blatant contradiction?  You're absolutely correct that BCH is a scam,
absolutely wrong that Bitcoin is dead, or killed by anyone.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:23:44
They will go where the profit is.
The BCH scam has no value as an actual altcoin.
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust a handful of incompetent devs under Ver's control.
They can't pump BCH forever, and the difficulty is going to skyrocket in a couple days,  and that will be that.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:47:09
No, he spends a TINY fraction of his ill-gotten blood money for propaganda.  
If he was good, he'd donate all the money he's scammed people out of with his abusive, monopolistic behavior.  
He wouln't be very rich after that though, so not gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:51:28
There is no "other side", just blatant propaganda and disinformation that has been debunked again and again, with every scam that comes down the line.  BCH is only one in a long line of such hostile takeover attempts.
Ver has no dev team to speak of.  Nobody in their right mind is going to trust a handful of incompetent programmers under his control with anything but the pump-n-dump schemes that he produces.
All hype, zero integrity. And even in the face of such attacks,
Bitcoin is doing just fine.

They have no power to do what you claim at all.
Take your propaganda back to /btc where it belongs.

It has nothing to do with this sub, and absolutely not "freakout"...
it has to do with a band of unscrupulous miners (hi Jihan) and scam artists (hi Ver) and corrupt corporate bad actors 
that have been attacking Bitcoin with their hostile takeover attempts.
Such attacks from hostile outsiders are a very legitimate concern. Fortunately, the more these gangsters try, easier and easier it is to recognize their scams (hi XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, x2...).

Dude, please go learn the first thing about how crypto, especially Bitcoin actually works,
before coming in a serious crypto forum repeating disinformation.  
This whole spiel about the whitepaper being some holy grail is 99% used to push scams from Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:34:49

Bitcoin has no moderation team.  This sub is just one Bitcoin / Crypto forum. There are many many more.
Scams like x2, and a long line of others before it, attack all of them.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:32:55
Can't even call "Classic" a legit altcoin.  It is just another hostile takeover attempt like Bcash, 2x, btc1, Unlimited, and so many other scams.  :/
The only thing they have to do with Bitcoin is they are all attacks aimed against it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:05:37
bCash is a scam because Ver has no claim to the name or resources of Bitcoin. Such shady business is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
BCH has negative legitimacy, as all serious Crypto, Open Source and Bitcoin enthusiasts know.
Also, the tiny handful of incompetent devs Ver has working for him. Nobody in their right mind is going to trust any of his scams with anything important.  
This latest get-rich-quick scheme, like those he's tried before it, has no technical functionality, or future.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:32:00
Very reasonable reaction to the huge brigading and shilling that was going on, pushing Ver's latest scam.  
Such abusive disinformation and propaganda campaigns are seen every time Jihan, Ver and Co. launch another get-rich-quick scheme.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, BCH...  We've seen it many, many times.  
Throwing spam in the bin is a good thing.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:24:34
It's been answered already, ad absurdum.
Stop spamming the forum with bullshit, then whining about some fantasy "censorship". 
Binning spam is good moderation.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:18:06
There is nothing of technical value at all in 2x, else the Bitcoin devs would be doing that now. 
2x is neither a legitimate fork, nor even a legit altcoin.  It is a hostile takeover attempt, pure and simple.
If the gangsters behind it did manage to take over Bitcoin's blockchain, Bitcoin would cease to exist.
Not gonna happen. As said, they don't even have a dev team. Putting anything of worth in the 2x scam would be insanity, unless maybe you're in on the scam yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:10:24
Fraud is as fraud does.  Ver is well known for exactly that.
Extreme hatred against Open Source, Crypto, specifically Bitcoin, and their communities is his business model. As well as that of those that repeat his lies and propaganda.  Stop that.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:30:21
Ver constantly pushes every scam he's behind on /btc. 
XT, Classic, Unlimited, bCash.... we've seen this corrupt behavior many times.
And every time, legit crypto forums (including /bitcoin) are bombarded with propaganda and disinformation pushing his latest scam. 
It's pretty obvious he uses /btc as one of the staging grounds for such brigades. :(
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:20:39
Take a little peek at the scams Ver has run, and his complete lack of integrity.  This is from his Unlimited scam earlier this year....
It has been known for a long time that this latest scam of Roger Ver's (xt, classic, now unlimited) have no technological value.
This latest attempt, Unlimited coin, is written by a handful of completely incompetent "devs", as has been abundantly demonstrated, again and again! The links below are *just a beginning*.
The Bitcoin Community is well aware, and nobody in their right mind will turn Bitcoin over to this snake oil salesman Ver and his ridiculously broken software teams. Not to mention the shady mining concerns (hello Jihan &amp; Co) that supported it before it became so blatantly obvious that it was Dead On Arrival.
Some background on the dangers of this Unlimited nonsense:
[These three well written articles by Aaron van Wirdum explain BU's 'Emergent Consensus' (spoiler alert - it's got issues)](
Even more damning, a complete rundown of the blatant, wilful scam that is Unlimited:
Thanks to for this excellent writeup, and plethora of linked sources:
[**The Astounding Incompetence, Negligence, and Dishonesty of the Bitcoin Unlimited Developers**](
As if that was not enough!  (thanks to for the excellent writeup and links.)
Add to this the [Damning evidence on how Bitcoin Unlimited pays shills.]( 
Roger Ver has no shred of integrity, honesty or trustworthiness in him. He and his cohorts such as Jihan &amp; Co are shunned with extreme prejudice by the Bitcoin and Crypto community, as well as Open Source in general, for for their destructive practices.
Just as his latest hijacking attempt, Unlimited is, Jihan's 2x hijack attempt is, 
as well as the cesspools of disinformation and propaganda they use to organize their paid brigading (hello /btc).
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:43:47
Bitcoin does not need shills, never has.  It *can't* have any as it is not a centrally controlled project.
BCash on the other hand, is very much centrally operated by proven bad actors.  It is nothing more than yet another hostile takeover attempt.
The ridiculous propaganda and disinformation behind Bcash is attempted again and again by those pushing such scams. Please take it back to /btc where it belongs.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:34:16


who told you that, Roger Ver?  Core has been working on SegWit and all the safe and sane scaling it brings with it, for years.
The only fiasco is scam artists like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co blocking that progress, and now pushing their own scams such as 2x, BCH, etc.
They have been, and are the problem.  Trusting their scams is the very opposite of an answer.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:27:14
The post is exposing Ver for the scam artist he is.
The video is blatant propaganda and disinformation, that is being called out here by actual Crypto enthusiasts.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:24:13
There is no "balance" when disinformation, propaganda and downright lies are being spread by Ver &amp; Co to push their scams.
With every attack, there is a huge surge in abusive shilling all over the web. It is a plague on legit Crypto forums (including this one).
The mods here are very tolerant, almost to a fault.  You have to step WAY over the line to get a comment deleted, let alone a ban.
Anyone abusing the rules and spreading such levels of destructive Ver &amp; Co. spam deserved to get shown the door.
Throwing away spam is not censorship, it is a public service and good moderation.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:39:24
That is a very good description.  Simple and to the point.
Willy-nilly increasing block size, with no protection against even further mining power centralization, is insanity.

It could be reasonably argued that 1mb is already too big.

bCash has no technical worth.  The tiny handful of incompetent devs working on it are under Ver &amp; Co's control. 
It has no real worth, or future.

"Classic" is a scam that has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:45:06
Be wary,  bitcoin.COM is Ver's scam website.  It has nothing to do with actual Bitcoin.  He uses that to push one scam after another.  BCH is only the latest in a long line of them.
Not sure about the iOS app of the same name, but there are legit ones out there.  Look at the ones promoted on bitcoin.ORG, they have shown themselves to be trustworthy.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:20:05
There is nothing of value wahtsoever in the 2x scam.  If there was, they could submit it to Bitcoin and the code would be accepted.
The gangsters behind 2x haven't even tried this. They have zero interest in improving Bitcoin, just controlling it completely. The very opposite of what Bitcoin is about.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:10:11
Because it is nothing more than yet another ridiculous attempt at character assassination, and has no place here, or anywhere else.
We've seen this crap all too often.  Post something completely abusive, then scream "cencorship!" when it's natrually axed.
The mods here are tolerant to a fault, but when someone crosses WAY over the line, they are forced to act.
Binning spam, disinformation and propaganda is not censorship, it is good moderation.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:59:40
There has been no "debate", there have been some unscrupulous mining outfits under Jihan's control pushing hostile takeover attempts and "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda, and yes, mining empty blocks. :/
Those mining outfits have no interest in solutions, only their get-rich-quick scams (btc1, bcash, 2x, Classic, Unlimited, etc..). Willy-nilly increasing max block size would encourage even more mining power centralization, which is what Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. have been after.
Mind you, there are plenty of trustworthy mining outfits that have supported Bitcoin all along.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:20:51
No, trusting a handful of incompetent devs under Ver's control is not a viable solution.
BCH is a pump n dump scam, a destructive and hostile one.
It has no technical value as an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:27:43
BCH is not a legitimate fork, nor legit altcoin.
It is yet another in a long line of hostile takeover attempts, just like 2x, bch1, Unlimited, Classic...  all the pretenders before it.
If Jihan, Ver &amp; Co had any interest in legitimate competition, they would not attempt to steal the resources of another project. 
Altcoins, with their own name and blockchain, are welcome and healthy.  BCH, 2x and the others listed above are nothing of the sort.

What there was is scam artists blocking Bitcoin progress for their own greedy profit.  the ones behind your beloved BCH scam.
BCash has nothing of worth to offer. The tiny handful of incompetent devs working on it are completely under the control of corrupt gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
Go throw your eggs in their basket if you want, just don't encourage others to invest in such blatant scams.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:33:41
bCash is nothing but a scam.  It has no dev team to speak of. Technically its a complete mess.  No worth as a cryptocurrency, and no future.
Not to mention the completely despicable behavior of trying to steal the name and resources of another project.  Zero legitimacy. Negative in fact.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:46:52
Respect the views of people pushing for the destruction of Bitcoin?  No. 
You're suggesting inviting kidnappers to dinner because their plan fell through. 
Nobody connected to the 2x scam can be trusted. 
We do have better things to do now than gloat, like getting segwit more widely implemented, but we can't forget who was attacking Bitcoin and its community. 
They will try again. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:27:01


None of these are of any worth.  They are hostile takeover attempts, that is all, just like BCH is.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:11:46
there's no real reason to call it "core"... it is just Bitcoin.
I suppose with all the scams out there trying to steal the name it does add clarity (Unlimited, Classic, btc1, bCash, 2x...).
Anyway, yes, good to see Bitcoin is chugging right along.
Exciting things to come now that SegWit is no longer being blocked by bad actors.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:41:23
Willy nilly increasing block size only encourages even further mining power centralization.
That's why gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. push their "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda so hard. 
Besides that, scams like Bcash, 2x, etc. are run by such gangsters, have no dev team to speak of.  They are hostile takeover attempts, not legitimate altcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:01:44
It is another in a long line of such scams by Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
none of them have any technical worth as cryptocurrencies. They are get-rich-quick schemes to steal people's money.  BCash has no claim to the bitcoin name, or other resources.
Such shady behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto,  and this Ver yahoo (behind BCH) does nothing but.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, BCH, and mixed up in btc1, 2x scams. We've seen it so many times before. Fortunately these hostile takeover attempts are getting easier and easier to spot.
Oh, and all the paid shills he employs to brigade legit crypto forums are incredibly abusive and annoying. There are lots of very good reasons, technical and social, to be against the BCH scam.
@_date: 2019-02-20 15:20:23
The "reports" saying how horrendously expensive Crypto mining (specifically targeting Bitcoin) is...

Mostly agree, except there is no "divide in the community". 
There is a constant and constant stream of hostile takeover attempts from unscrupulous outsiders.  (Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCH, x2, etc...)
The scam artists pushing their get-rich-quick schemes are no part of the Bitcoin, Crypto or Open Source communities.  Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's business is directly attacking these communities.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:36:08
The scams Ver pushes are very objectively worthless as actual cryptocurrencies.  The tiny handful of devs he can get to work for him have proven themselves incompetent again, and again.
They are no "alternatives" whatsoever.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, and also mixed up in Jihan's scams btc1, 2x... this BCH pump-n-dump scheme is no different. Every hostile takeover attempt these gangsters push spits in the face of Open Source, Crypto and specifically Bitcoin.
The bad actors behind such hostile takeover attempts have earned every bit of shunning and mistrust they get.
Fortunately, their scams are getting very easy to spot,
and even in the face of such attacks, Bitcoin is doing just fine.

The BCH scam is completely his baby.  Only has a tiny handful of devs that will work for him, and they have proven to be completely incompetent, as well as shady characters like Ver.

@_date: 2017-11-11 22:28:35
You saying you've hung out on /btc and still, somehow, don't see the propaganda, shows either your naivete, or that you're willfully spreading disinformation.
Jihan, Ver, and their cronies and goons have zero interest in legit competition.
In Open Source, the source code is free to use for your *own* project. With its own name, and in this case, blockchain.  They have neither attempted to offer any code to the Bitcoin project, nor are they capable of it. They consistently stage hostile takeover attempts against already established projects. 
BCash, Unlimited, Classic, btc1, 2x, pretty much anything Ver is mixed up in, none of them act as a legit altcoin, much less a fork.  They are attempts to steal the good name (and other resources) that he *has zero claim to*.
Such despicable, abusive attacks are discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto. 
Ver is well known for using paid shills, as well as depending on the people he fools with his scams to repeat his propaganda.  Hopefully you are simply unaware of who you're supporting. 
Even if you're fully aware, and just spreading more propaganda, we'll list this, yet again, for others that are not in the know yet:
Unlimited was another in the long line of scams Ver has abused the Crypto world with, with just such blatant disinformation brigades. Also using his scam site bitcoin.COM, and /btc (among others) as a staging ground for them:

Shady gangsters such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co constantly push their hostile takeover attempts... every time over the last years, we see the same dirty tricks.  Mempool fills up, and their shills start screaming about usability.

@_date: 2017-11-12 09:57:05
Completely unrealistic fantasy there dude.
BCH has no real-world value as an actual cryptocurrency.  This pump and dump that the gangsters behind it are doing is temporary.
Nobody in their right mind is going to actually use Ver's scamcoin for anything important.  He hardly has a dev team. A handful of incompetents, and under corrupt corporate control.  
No, BCH  has no future as anything else but a get-rich-quick scheme.
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:47:10

do flag such blatant propaganda and disinformation that Ver, Jihan &amp; co push as the scams they are.  
The consistent brigades of outright lies that legit Crypto forums are subjected to (this one included) every time these gangsters try another hostile takeover attempt, are debunked again, and again.
We've seen such so many times.  Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCH, 2x...  
get rich quick scams with no worth as legit altcoins. Even if some Crypto newbies are fooled for a time, the vast majority are very aware of Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's schemes, as well as the corrupt corporate banking and  business that support such scams.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:00:36

"the market" isn't behind scams like bCash.  Some wealthy corporate types are pumping it to try to make a quick buck.  It has no value of its own, especially not technically.
Ver, Jihan &amp; Co. have tried this crap again and again, and the market has denied them again and again.  Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, bch...  none could even be called a legit altcoin.
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust a handfull of incompetent devs under corrupt corporate control with anything important. BCH has no future.

Until those solutions are exhausted, any hype about "Big Blocks NOW!" is just supporting scam artists behind hostile takeover attempts like 2x, bCash, Classic, Unlimited, etc...
The "immediate relief" you're on about is arguing for the direct destruction of Bitcoin.  There is nothing good to be had in investing in scams and the push for a centralized crypto that attempts to steal the resources of an already established project.

BCH is a project of Roger Ver's.  It has nothing to do with Bitcoin whatsoever.  He is well konw for trying to hijack the name and resources of other Open Source projects. Something that is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
The handful of incompetent devs he has working on BCH have proven themselves not only as shady as he is, but completely clueless. They couldn't even figure out how to increase max block size.
The BCH scam is nothing but another in a long line of pump-n-dump schemes.   Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x... so many hostile takeover attempts before it.  Ver is also well known for employing shills to pump such scams, and uses his website bitcoin.COM to promote them.  Also, the cesspool of disinformation that is /btc is under his corrupt corporate control. He uses that sub to shamelessly promote his scams.
Bitcoin on the other hand has a HUGE, international dev team. A huge following of trustworthy miners supporting it, as well as the formidable Bitcoin community.  It is well respected among crypto and open source communities as a legitimate Open Source project, and very worthy Cryptocurrency.
There is a damn good reason why shady gangsters such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. are constantly staging attacks against Bitcoin, and a dam good reason why they have been denied their schemes, again, and again.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:27:11
That's not relevant at all.  What one Bitcoin is worth today, half a Bitcoin can be worth in a year.

SegWit, and Bitcoin progress was being blocked by the "Big Blocks NOW!" scam artists for months and months.
Nobody cares what those yahoos say. They've been constantly and consistently attacking Bitcoin with hostile takeover attempts all along.
Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have nothing of value to add, and your constant support of their scams is very much as anti-Bitcoin, anti-Crypto and anti-Open Source as the scams themselves.
The blatant disinformation you constantly spew here would be welcome over at /btc... why don't you take it back there.
@_date: 2016-02-12 22:05:36
If a tiny dev team, (huge corporate backing or no) of a separate altcoin project (ClassicCoin and Bitcoin are incompatable) takes over the Bitcoin infrastructure (blockchain), then bitcoin ceases to exist.
There is no way realistic threat of this happening. What they are doing though is stirring up a bunch of shit (with huge corporate backing for propaganda).
What I do not see in any arguments for ClassicCoin is, what is so much better about it, and why is a complete hijacking of Bitcoin necessary to accomplish that?
@_date: 2016-02-25 16:10:52
Oh god dude, give up. 
Nobody is buying your DOOM scenario. 
Bitcoin devs are working on everything that needs to be worked on,
there is no imminent danger whatsoever.
Your one (dubious) example is highly dubious,
as there simply is no massive backlog.
What, exactly, do these "tadeblock" yahoos have to gain from spewing such disinformation?
besides tons of profits, that's obvious to anyone that looks at it. (will not support that shit with a link here)
Go get a real job, nobody cares about your propaganda.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2016-02-22 10:38:18
It already is. The dev team is doing a fine job.
Why do you think they are doing so horrible they need to be replaced with like 5 dudes (with a shitload of corporate money behind them)?
What I'd like to see is for any corporate influences, like this "colored coin" or "sidechain" bullshit disappear. It is detrimental to everything bitcoin brings to the table. All that crap will accomplish is turning bitcoin into a corporately controlled profit machine. THIS is an actual issue.
But the dev team is already working on the "issues" that Classic Coin is complain... wait, what are they complaining about again?  This is something that is never really explained.
@_date: 2016-02-22 20:46:55

You deny that Jihan Wu is an unscrupulous miner running a hostile takeover attempt?
Jeeze dude, you know, there were large mining pools back in the day of graphics card mining that approached that all so important 51%,
know what they did?  they split into smaller groups, showing their integrity by encouraging the pool members to split off.
This is exactly the opposite of the behavior we're seeing from shady outfits run by scam artists such as Jihan and Roger Ver.  They have zero product, and are running nothing more than corporate (or government) backed hostile takeover attempts.
Shit needs to stop.  
@_date: 2016-02-11 16:35:43
A fork is starting a project based of another. This is in no way what Classic Coin devs and their backers are attempting. What the Classic Coin altcoin project wants is to completely take over the parent Bitcoin project. This is in no way respectable behavior for a "fork" project.
If classic coin wants to be taken seriously, they need their own infrastructure. Most importantly, their own damn blockchain. Until then they can be seen as nothing but destructive elements  working directly against bitcoin.
An altcoin needs its own forum (and blockchain for that matter!). Telling them that is "censoring" is simply more manipulative, destructive behavior. We've seen enough of this type of this shit slinging here lately.
@_date: 2016-02-11 17:18:08
Absolutely.  Altcoins are good. Trying to completely take over the parent project's blockchain is not. 
This talk about "forking" is just more disinformation and propaganda. As you point out, it is no such thing.
Bitcoin's blockchain works with bitcoin, and if another project like this new "Classic" altcoin steals or disrupts it, bitcoin dies. Only one can use the bitcoin blockchain. I, and the vast majority of people who understand this, prefer that is bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-23 15:02:44
Oh god, we've had enough of this type of blatant propaganda nonsense.
Stop now.
@_date: 2016-02-10 10:26:41
There is a tiny minority of devs that have branched off to make their own "classic coin".  It appears they have an enormous amount of funding too, which is very odd.
The motives of this new project are what are sketchy, not the devs of the actual bitcoin project. 
Bitcoin is just fine as it is, the devs are doing a good job, and no amount of propaganda money dumped into reddit and other media venues will change that.  Nice try though.

"decentralization" in the context of cryptocurrency refers to Mining power and Nodes.
It has zero to do with software.
The only people that try to confuse the term with software are working for hostile hijacking attempts such as XT, Classic, and lately Unlimited.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:55:37
There is zero need for "Big Blocks NOW!" that scam artists like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co push.
They were forced to stop blocking SegWit by the threat of a UASF,
now that SegWit is activated, all the exciting scaling tech it opens the door for can be explored.
Until those avenues for safe and sane scaling are exhausted, there is no legit need for even talking about block size.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:07:32
2x is nothing more than another in a long line of hostile takeover attempts.
It has nothing to do with Bitcoin, except trying to steal the name and reputation.
They don't even have a dev team.  It's a huge joke.  One being backed by very rich bankers. :/
What they want is another centrally controlled payment method. No thanks, we already have credit cards.
@_date: 2016-02-12 19:37:04
They want control of the parent project's infrastructure (bitcoin blockchain).
If that happened, bitcoin will be dead.

@_date: 2016-02-11 10:02:39
There is obviously huge profit to be made by a select few, and they are investing heavily. Many would love to twist bitcoin into something easy to manipulate for profit as fiat currency is.
This is the true danger of this hostile takeover attempt.
@_date: 2016-02-11 11:21:43
lol.. no, but nice try.  See, not everyone buys into this kind of propaganda. 
More and more casual users of Bitcoin are getting wise to blatant FUD attempts such as this.
There is nothing of value to a project trying to kill off the mother project in a hostile takeover attempt of the original infrastructure.
Let Classic Coin get its own blockchain, as it should be. Competition is good, but how they're acting is anything but.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.

@_date: 2017-11-19 00:46:53
The scams Ver, Jihan &amp; Co constantly and consistently push have no value as actual Cryptocurrencies.
If they had any interest in making a bona fide altcoin, they would have *tried*.  They have neither interest, nor the technical capability.
The tiny handful of shady, incompetent devs they can get to work on their get-rich-quick schemes can't even figure out how to increase max block size. 
It would be laughable, except for the *huge* amounts of money they put into blatant propaganda to push their scams.
Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCH, 2x... all fail completely as serious Cryptocurrencies.  
The fees you (and they) complain about are the result of a band of miners under Jihan's control blocking Bitcoin progress, spamming the blockchain with garbage, and spreading disinformation about some fantasy "controversy".  (just like you are attempting) :(
Now that they were forced to shape up or ship out by the threat of a UASF, SegWit is finally free to go forward, and all the exciting scaling tech that comes with it!
If you want to blame someone for holding up Bitcoin progress, the responsibility and blame lies squarely on the shoulders of bad actors such as Ver.
@_date: 2016-02-11 09:59:01

There are PLENTY of choices.  Altcoins abound. True competition between projects is good, and welcome.
They all have their own blockchain. This is key.
The aggressive, destructive behavior this new  ClassicCoin team displays is strictly anti-competetive. They are not offering choice, but trying to kill it with a hostile takeover.
Don't try to twist this around. You are defending a tiny handful of unscrupulous devs ("classic"coin) and their greedy corporation backers.
@_date: 2016-02-12 07:05:06
Technically the "clasic coin" software is a fork,  but it is not compatible with the bitcoin project. The simple fact it is trying to use the parent project's blockchain is inexcusable. 
No, fork projects do not behave so.  This is a hostile takeover attempt. Stop trying to confuse people with technicalities.
There is no way in hell that anywhere near 75% of anyone will use this, not the way it is.  If they wanted to truly compete, they would act respectable and use their own blockchain, and forums.
Who is going to choose a tiny handful of devs, with huge, shady financial backing, that are acting in such an untrustworthy manner?
Bitcoin, and it's large and knowledgeable dev team, is doing just fine. That is the consensus. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 15:31:33
Incopatible coins belong on seperate blockchains.
There are TONS of altcoins, which is what "classic" coin is, by all rights.
The difference is, they want to kill the parent project by taking over its blockchain. 
More competition is good. Trying to kill it, is not.
Again, I ask, should we invite every altcoin to use Bitcoin's blockchain?  o0
@_date: 2016-02-11 16:09:59
Give us a break, as if you know what a fork is.
You don't understand what an aggressive takeover attempt is either, nor do you care, obviously.
We've had enough of this type of brainless shit-slinging here lately.
This type of behavior is typical of either usefull idiots that have bought into the propaganda,
or paid shills working on contract to try and derail intelligent argument on a very important technology.
Nither of which have a clue what they're talking about.
For anyone else reading this deep that does not know: A fork is not possible on bitcoin's blockcahin. What this "Classic" altcoin project is attempting is to completely take over bitcoin infrastructure. This has zero to do with a fork.
If they had their own blockchain, acted as a respectable altcoin, they would have had a chance, maybe.
With gressive, destructive behaviors like these, there is no trusting the team behind it, to say nothing of their shady financial backers.
@_date: 2016-02-01 06:29:08
Bitcoin can, and will, when it is actually needed.
What we can't afford is to let another altcoin project aggressively take over the already established bitcoin infrastructure.

No,  "centralization" in the context of crypto refers to mining power and node density. It has nothing to do with software.
There is only one Open Source Bitcoin project.  BCH is purely a scam. One of a long line from Ver, Jihan &amp; Co.  Hostile takeover attempts with zero legitimacy.
It is absolutely reasonable and beneficial to take action against such.

So you think both should just use the same blockchain?  This is an incredibly stupid idea. Talk about FUD.
What do you find so horrible about bitcoin and its dev team? Why do you think it so necessary for a different team to completely take over bitcoin infrastructure? 
It can't jsut be block size limit, as bitcoin devs are already addressing that. What else are they doing that deserves being completely dismissed from the project?
@_date: 2016-02-24 17:23:54
I'd say it's harder to get more irrelevant than the QT dev team right now. If they got their own blockchain the project might be interesting.
Anyway, the big stink being stirred up lately, that I've seen, is from the "ClassicCoin" team. So much FUD and straight up shit-slinging. :(
Impossible to take that project seriously. At this point, even if they got their own blockchain and acted as a respectable altcoin, I've lost all trust in them.
@_date: 2017-04-13 11:44:31
It is completely unnecessary.  
BU will never go through with their proposed attack.
If Jihan and his band of unscrupulous miners actually did stage a 51% attack... holy shit,  
they just might huh? but why don't they now?  I think they aren't anywhere near that.. just lots of bark with little bite.

@_date: 2016-02-09 14:56:34
Well, if you build a client to take over another project's network, then yes, that is a hostile takeover attempt. This is a very simple and self-evident thing to grasp.
Core, and the devs working on it, is bitcoin.
This new "classic coin" is a completely different project that is trying to hijack the already established bitcoin infrastructure. That's a dick move, and I really wonder at their motivation.
There are tons of people that would like to see bitcoin die, or control it for profit as they do fiat money. With all the "classic coin" propaganda and downright shit slinging around here lately, and on other bitcoin forums, it really looks like this is the intent.
Someone has a LOT to gain by killing off bitcoin as we know it, and putting a tiny faction of devs in charge of the whole deal. I say this stinks.

A constructive takeover attempt?  no such thing... or, it is called an altcoin.
Competition is good, as said, but it requires the project to have it's own blockchain (and own forums too).
Any kind of takeover attempt is trying to kill competition. This cannot be called constructive in any way.
@_date: 2016-02-09 01:11:14


They are not, so this is a non-issue.
The issue is another project trying to completely take over bitcoin's already well-established infrastructure, instead of getting their own blockchain, as proper altcoins do.
Altcoins are in no way a problem. Competition is a good thing.
Hostile takeover attempts of the parent project are not.

The ridiculous "censorship" nonsense is jsut more disinformation, propaganda and lies. We see such claims trotted out with every new hostile takeover attempt (Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, bCash)...
Personally I'd bin all that destructive disinformation as the spam it is. The Mods here take a lighter handed approach. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:34:50
Some actual facts about Ver and his scams.  This is from back when he was pushing Unlimited.  His mehtods have only gotten worse. :(
It has been known for a long time that this latest scam of Roger Ver's (xt, classic, now unlimited) have no technological value.
This latest attempt, Unlimited coin, is written by a handful of completely incompetent "devs", as has been abundantly demonstrated, again and again! The links below are *just a beginning*.
The Bitcoin Community is well aware, and nobody in their right mind will turn Bitcoin over to this snake oil salesman Ver and his ridiculously broken software teams. Not to mention the shady mining concerns (hello Jihan &amp; Co) that supported it before it became so blatantly obvious that it was Dead On Arrival.
Some background on the dangers of this Unlimited nonsense:
[These three well written articles by Aaron van Wirdum explain BU's 'Emergent Consensus' (spoiler alert - it's got issues)](
Even more damning, a complete rundown of the blatant, wilful scam that is Unlimited:
Thanks to for this excellent writeup, and plethora of linked sources:
[**The Astounding Incompetence, Negligence, and Dishonesty of the Bitcoin Unlimited Developers**](
As if that was not enough!  (thanks to for the excellent writeup and links.)
Add to this the [Damning evidence on how Bitcoin Unlimited pays shills.]( 
Roger Ver has no shred of integrity, honesty or trustworthiness in him. He and his cohorts such as Jihan &amp; Co are shunned with extreme prejudice by the Bitcoin and Crypto community, as well as Open Source in general, for for their destructive practices.
Just as his latest hijacking attempt, Unlimited is, Jihan's 2x hijack attempt is, 
as well as the cesspools of disinformation and propaganda they use to organize their paid brigading (hello /btc).

Ok, I have zero problem with altcoins that behave themselves, like you say Ethereum does, or litecoin, or even Dogecoin. These are good projects, and fully respectable (and even sometimes fun!)
I disagree that an altcoin trying to take over its parent project is in any way a good thing, especially when using the strongarm tactics this "classic coin" altcoin is.
IF the majority wants the fork, then running Classic Coin as a true fork, an atcoin, will bring them all the profit they deserve. 
As it is, they are showing us nothing but the opposite of respect and true, fair competition, (to put it mildly). Their abusive, anti-competitive tactics make it clear that what they want to twist bitcoin into is only for their own profit. 
I wonder who is really bankrolling this whole propaganda campaign supporting such shady actions.
@_date: 2016-02-12 13:46:46

Speaking of sound, how loud is it under normal conditions?
One of the best things about the RasPi solution (IMO) is passive cooling.
@_date: 2016-02-01 07:52:51
By all rights, it cannot accurately be referred to as Bitcoin whatsoever.  I promote the name "classic coin".  It is an altcoin.
That they are so aggressively trying to kill the mother project by making clients to use the proper Bitcoin blockchain is inexcusable.
Also, the propaganda campaign they have going here, and other online forums is nothing other than abusive in the extreme.
Ya have to wonder why they are SOOOO invested in killing Bitcoin off. If they have a better solution, the proper, respectable way is to have their project on its own blockchain, with its own forums.
Does Ethereum have its own blockchain?  If so, then more power to them. If they are truely better, people will use it. 
What I'm worried about is the aggressive takeover, and why. There are so many greedy forces that want to have control over bitcoin like they do over typical fiat currencies. 
The reprehensible strongarm methods being employed here, and elsewhere, the very obvious propaganda flooding all bitcoin forums speaks volumes.  I have zero respect for "classic coin" until they do the work themselves, build their own blockchain infrastructure.
Only then will we see which is truly the superior. As it stands now, the way this "classic coin" project, and the people so heavily investing in it, is abusively trying to kill off and take over it's parent project (authentic bitcoin) looks like yet another attempt to co-opt and destroy everything that makes bitcoin so great. 
Fork away, altcoins are a good thing, if they get their own blockchain and forums. If they actually put in the work themselves instead of trying to steal it, and if the "classic" altcoin is *truely* better, hell, everyone will start using it instead. I would. 
Until then, no dice.

@_date: 2016-02-13 12:37:06
We are not talking about the code, we are talking about the infrastructure, bitcoin's blockchain. Without it, the code is useless.
Every altcoin has thier own, but The ClassicCoin team and their backers want bitcoin's.  I fail to see why this is necessary. 
I agree that Blockstream and their entire idea and propaganda about "sidechains" seems shady as fuck.  It could easily ruin all the good things cryptocurrency has going for it.
I'd very much like bitcoin to steer well clear of any such things.  I also very much disapprove of "colored coins" and anything that lets Big Money get leverage like they do over fiat currencies.
I think it makes much more sense to talk about and work on that, than push for a complete takeover of bitcoin. Though, I can definitely understand that perspective much better than worries about block size.
@_date: 2016-02-12 08:13:03

Try again, an actual argument about technology, or the politics of such a takeover attempt.
Also, please ask one of the friends you claim to have in the industry what a blockchain actually is.
Every altcoin need their own. This is a very simple and basic concept to understand.
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:17:23
oh give me a break. Where are you getting these numbers?

@_date: 2016-02-21 15:14:07
The coins would be incompatible. There is zero good reason put forward for this upstart "classic coin" altcoin to take over the bitcoin blockchain.
Or should we just invite ALL altcoins to use it?  Come on litecoin,  Dodgecoin, pile on...  the idea is ridiculous.
There is also zero good reason, besides massive corporate profit, for such ridiculous ideas like colored coins and sidechains.
@_date: 2016-02-27 06:47:51
Irrelevant. There was never a chance of consensus favouring this startup classic coin to begin with. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 16:02:52
Altcoins are a good thing. Competition is healthy.
Another project stealing bitcoin's blockchain is neither.
@_date: 2016-02-22 06:51:30
There need be no judgement on anything.
There is no consensus, never was a chance for it.
The point is moot, because there is zero need.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2016-02-12 20:40:14
There is no way in hell anywhere close to 75% of miners are doing this.
The whole discussion is completely ridiculous, and a HUGE waste of time.
What we need to talk about is the problems people see in this or that direction the actual bitcoin project is taking,
not some silly complete takeover fantasy.
This is the HUGE problem I see here. People in favor of this new startup ClassicCoin project (and their sudden huge corporate backing) are not talking about actual problems. There is just an enormous ammount of propaganda, shit-slinging, and unintelligent shaming attempts.
Ain't nothing good coming of any of it. In fact, it's completely detrimental to any good, constructive criticism they might have.
Do you know of any reason to mistrust the bitcoin devs? Anything going against the technological and economic merit cryptocurrencies offer over fiat?
@_date: 2017-04-13 11:00:54
If you run wallets and nodes and miners that are incompatible with Bitcoin,  then you are not using bitcoin.
Can you use an UnlimitedCoin wallet to send and recieve bona fide Bitcoin?  No.  Therefore it is an altcoin at best.
One that spits in the face of the best practices of Open Source. 
The *source code* is open and free to copy / modify / whatever,
the *resources* (like project name, and in the case of cryptocurrency, a project's blockchain) are NOT open for anyone to hijack.
Such shady behavior (looking at you XT, Classic, Unlimited) is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just cryptocurrency. 
There are several wallets and implementations that respect the actual Bitcoin Project.. fully compatible. 
Many are promoted on bitcoin.org in the Getting Started section.  
This all still has ZERO to do with "decentralization" in the context of cryptocurrency.  Again, that idiom means decentralization of mining power and nodes in cryptocurrency jargon. Nothing else.
We've seen a dangerous centralization of *mining power* in unscrupulous mining outfits like run by Jihan Wu &amp; Co lately.  This is what "decentralization" means. Abusing it as these yahoos are is a direct attack on everything cryptocurrency stands for. 
Also scam artists like Roger Ver and his "Bitcoin" Classic, Unlimited etc... that has *no right* to the Bitcoin name or blockchain, are NOT in any way at all examples of "decentralization".  Again, the only people that falsely use that jargon to describe software are either ignorant about Open Source, or working for such scam artists.
Scams like UnlimitedCoin have nothing to do with the Bitcoin project, except their hostile takeover attempt of the parent project's resources (name, reputation and blockchain). 
@_date: 2016-02-14 05:17:34

@_date: 2016-02-14 05:27:04
Do you have any links articles, threads, whatever about this Blockstream company and their relationship with Bitcoin? This sounds like a real disaster. 
Bitcoin can't share the blockchain with any other project. It's already 50+GB to download. Piggybacking another currency on it would be ridiculous.  How big is it now?  Having more than one type of currency on it would make it even bigger, and useless for the ones not interested in the other currency.
If the dev team bow down to corporate pressures, such dangerous things like "sidechains", "colored coins" and such other attempts to turn it into fiat, then bitcoin will cease to be useful in the ways it is now.
Then I'd be switching over to an altcoin.  If that is ClassicCoin, or another, well we'll see.  I don't like ClassicCoin's style though, and don't trust their motivations. Too heavy handed.
At this point what really needs to be done is to put huge pressure on the bitcoin devs to abandon all ideas like "sidechains" and anything that can be easily controlled by current financial giants.
@_date: 2016-02-20 12:12:05
The first slide is right on the money. We've had to put WAY too much effort into quelling a hostile takeover attempt by a tiny minority.
The last slide sounds like a bunch of bullshit trying to turn bitcoin into one of those political currencies they were talking about on slide 2. No business 'needs' this crap.
@_date: 2016-02-22 09:54:26
Nobody wants that deal, because it would mean turning over bitcoin development to a tiny handful of dissenters, for basically non-existent problems.

Poppycock.  Classic Coin doesn't have a chance. 
Never was a serious threat of a HF at all, not from them.

@_date: 2017-04-13 13:54:46
Umm... if some open sourse project has a stated objective to become incompatibale with current bona fide bitcoin wallets, 
then yah, there's no reason for them to call themselves bitcoin anymore.  The only respectable thing to do would be to rename their project. 
Also, if they started broadcasting incompatible "coins", then they should not be spamming up the Bitcoin blockchain, but use their own.
At the very least, use the bitcoin test network... though even that is abusive.
What is with your 100.0%?  It is Bitcoin, or it is not.  
There is compatibility, that can be sent and received from legitimate bitcoin wallets, or it is an altcoin.   This is a very simple idea.
Err.. say we have a project like OpenOffice..  and some shady company clones it and calls itself OpenOfficeXT...
And uses a format that the original used, say .XYZ format, but modify it so it is incompatible, but ADVERTISE it as an "improved", "Classic", or "Unlimited" .XYZ   ...
It is not .XYZ and it is not OpenOffice.  
@_date: 2017-04-09 23:16:16

@_date: 2016-02-02 18:39:36
Nobody benefits from people trying to kill off bitcoin, except the people doing it.
If some altcoin works better, great, we'll use it. There is absolutely no excuse for this kind of hostile takeover attempt...
Except, there are lots of people very much interested in ruining the things about bitcoin that make it so great, with the aim of being able to control it and profit from that like with fiat currencies.
I'm not havin' any of it.  Fork away people. Altcoin all ya want, but trying to ruin a different project cannot be encouraged, and people doing it cannot be trusted.
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:59:39
There are lots of altcoins. All respectable so long they are a true fork and do not try to disrupt each others infrastructure.
Even something silly like Dogecoin has it's own blockchain. 
That this "classic coin" project is so aggressively trying to take over or disrupt the bitcoin blockchain is inexcusable. 
You really, really have to wonder at the motivation behind the destructive, untrustworthy behavior the "classic" altcoin team has displayed.
@_date: 2016-02-12 19:34:09
They are simply trying to completely take over years of work behind the bitcoin name and infrastructure for their own altcoin project.
They won't succeed, no matter how much blatant propaganda money they pump into public forums around the internet.
Bitcoin is doing just fine. The large and knowledgeable Bitcoin dev team are addressing any serious concerns that the ClassicCoin project is crying "DOOM!" about.
The real topic is those concerns.  We never hear about that.
What is the Bitcoin team doing so wrong?  Why all the mistrust and shit-slinging going on in so many forums (here included)?
@_date: 2016-02-14 11:09:21
Seeing where this silly "sidechain" business is going, I agree.  This is very, very bad news for bitcoin. :(
@_date: 2016-02-22 06:53:51
There is zero crisis, just a shitload of money going into a ton of propaganda and shilling on bitcoin forums.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2016-02-22 20:45:15
There are normal forums that are much better suited to positively identifying its visitors.
This would kill reddit, as anonymous commenting is part of what makes it so popular.
Still, the sock puppets are a problem, and it is very obvious all the blatant propaganda and outright shilling going on here, and on other bitcoin forums lately.
Making people aware of this will help a lot, so this is a very good article. 
@_date: 2016-02-11 07:23:43
Hostile takeover attempt from the beginning.
Classic Coin needs it's own blockchain to be taken seriously as anything else.
@_date: 2017-04-01 23:52:21
Comparing SegWit with that scam BU is completely counterproductive.
They do not belong on the same chart whatsoever.
SegWit is legitimate. There is no comparison with BU.
@_date: 2017-04-13 11:10:47
err.. Bitcoin DOES have a solid specification.
Those that produce incompatible blocks, that use the Bitcoin blockchain in other ways, are disreputable spam.
Legitimate sister projects that produce bona fide, compatible bitcoin are fine.
As are legitimate altcoins, that use their own resources (name, blockchain).  Competition is good.
Hostile takeover attempts are to be discouraged with extreme prejudice. (hello UnlimitedCoin)
@_date: 2017-04-04 08:06:06
There are no two "sides".
There is Bitcoin,
and there are hostile takeover attempts such as BU, and disreputable miners seeking to seize control.
Zero reason to "bridge" with destructive scam artists.
@_date: 2017-04-13 12:14:59
That would happen with SegWit.
@_date: 2016-02-28 09:15:36
The currencies are incompatible. 
"Classic Coin" never had a chance to start with, but if it did ever come to that, it most definitely would be detrimental to bitcoin, for many reasons.
It's a moot point though, really. Classic coin ain't got a chance. Never had, never will. All they have is a bunch of advertising money to push disinformation and propaganda. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 16:19:06
Prob is, classic coin don't want us to have a choice. Instead of using their own blockchain as any proper, respectable altcoin does, they want to hijack bitcoin's. 
These clowns are not to be taken seriously. Long live bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 18:41:56
There is nothing cynical about calling destructive takeover attempts what they are. It's simply what is going on.
Want choice? Me too. Proper altcoins provide this.  What you seem to be for is a lack of choice. You'd like to take it away from anyone that does not agree with you.
This is bad for bitcoin, competition and ironically, for potential altcoin users of the project that is attempting the takeover.
@_date: 2016-02-01 06:24:47
It is straight up spam. Please don't encourage this crap.
@_date: 2016-02-12 19:21:58
The software fork is irrelevant.  Don't try to confuse the issue.
A true forked cryptocurrency project is an altcoin with its *own blockchain*. This is the way to provide choice and true competition. There are tons of altcoins out there, all with their own blockchain. This is good for the technology.
A hostile takeover attempt ("classic"coin) of another's established infrastructure (Bitcoin blockchain) is in no way acting in good faith or even respectably.
Fork away, but with your own blockchain. Competition is good.
What the handful of ClassicCoin devs and their heavy corporate funding is doing, is completely anti-competitive and destructive. They are trying to kill off the parent project (Bitcoin). The two coins are incompatible and belong on separate blockchains. 
Let the best altcoin win, fairly.
@_date: 2016-02-22 23:42:42
Give it a rest. There is a huge amount of money going into blatant propaganda and downright shilling here, and on many other bitcoin forums.
There is no point to it, nor have I seen any real ones made. Just a whole bunch of DOOM supporting this hostile takeover attempt.
People that know what's up aren't having any of it. There was never any chance of Classic coin taking over the blockchain. There is no issue here, so stop trying to conjure up one.
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:31:17
This whole aggressive takeover attempt is just that. There is no merit in it. People over at that know what is actually good for bitcoin agree. The complete takeover of bitcoin by some startup who's greatest strength is a huge propaganda budget is not good for any such project.
They have resorted to obvious shilling to influence public opinion on many bitcoin forums, including reddit. Pay attention and beware of aggressive shit slinging. This disruption, and the huge budget behind it, is unworthy of all the good such cryptocurrency technology has going for it. 
If the aggressors here ("classic" coin project) wanted real competition, they'd create a real fork, 
*with its own blockchain.*
They are doing nothing of the kind.
@_date: 2016-02-16 19:53:48
Still need to be extremely careful with any of this.
Letting large companies dictate the direction bitcoin goes is a recipe for disaster. 
There all of this stuff is ripe for abuse, and I'd rather see it be kept as conservative and safely isolated as possible.
The last thing we need is the ridiculous idea that some kind of "security" is mandatory for every transaction. Bitcoin is secure enough.
@_date: 2016-02-11 20:01:15
Dude, don't even try to compare the two projects.
Bitcoin been going on for years, has built up an incredible infrastructure and public response. It has a very large and knowledgeable dev team.
This new "classic" altcoin is nothing more than a few devs, with huge financial backing. They are aggressively trying to take over all that bitcoin has built up. 
To turn it over to these yahoos would be disastrous for bitcoin.
That could very well be the motive behind it, or maybe, like so many others, they are planning on twisting bitcoin into something as controllable and profitable as fiat currency.
@_date: 2016-02-28 21:13:46
Shilling and astroturfing is pretty standard for reddit, not just here, but on tons of other subs. If you've been paying attention to this sub lately, it's damn obvious there's a lot of money being thrown around.
There are some concerns, and classic coin bring way more problems than all their "doom!" stories. 
The Bitcoin dev team is already working on the block size concerns, which is the only serious issue I've ever heard this new upstart "classic coin" addressing.
No way people are going to go for turning the entire bitcoin project over to a tiny dev team of dissenters, especially with all the blatant propaganda and disinformation being thrown around behind it.
If they wanted to be taken seriously, they'd have their own blockchain, as any respectable altcoin does.
In the end, it is a non-issue. There never was a chance for their hostile takeover attempt to work.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2016-02-02 15:25:29
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
The only major problems lately are some altcoins wanting to use bitcoin's established infrastructure for their own projects.
@_date: 2016-02-11 10:40:29
The whole problem is, this startup classic coin project donesn't *have* a blockchain. They are trying to forcefully take over the established infrastructure Bitcoin has built up over years.
If they acted as an altcoin (by all rights, that is what Classic Coin is) things would be fine.  Competition is good.
Hostile takeover attempts, funded by greedy bigwigs, is nothing but a danger to everything so great about bitcoin.
They (ClassicCoin devs) want to kill the parent project (Bitcoin). If they were serious about their idea being the better alternative, they would do it right, with their own blockchain. This would give people an honest and fair choice. *If* their project is the better, people would use it. I would, but this is not what they are doing at all.
Why I don't trust them, their motivation, or backing. Now, after all the obvious paid shilling and propaganda they've invested in here and on other bitcoin forums, even if they did launch their own proper, respectable project with its own blockchain, I'd not trust it one bit.
@_date: 2016-02-11 16:26:00
A fork is taking the original software and modifying it on a new project. Like OpenOffice was forked by Libraoffice.
What Classic Coin is attempting is extermination of the project they are basing theirs on. A complete takeover of the parent project's infrastructure. 
The two are in no way comparable. 
This is why the classic coin devs and their shady methods, are in no way respectable or trustworthy. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 20:32:15
There is zero possibility. You cannot change a project's direction so drastically with such aggressive, hostile takeover attempts.
Bitcoin devs (no need for "core") are working on the size concern. 2MB is still a problem, but one they are working on.
It seems there are other problems some have with the entire project, and want it for themselves. This is in no way evolution. It is a child project (ClassicCoin) hijacking the parent project's (Bitcoin's) infrastructure.
I fully support a fork, with *its own blockchain*.
Let the best altcoin win. We must be very, very wary of huge financial interests trying to muscle out all the good things cryptocurrencies offer.
Is there anything else besides the proposed 2mb changes that are of true value for discussion? The discussion belongs there. "Classic"coin's aggressive behavior only damages the chances of such a discussion.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:21:52

I constantly hear silly crap about how classic coin is supposedly better, but no real reason to hand over the blockchain to a tiny deve team.
(well, except, the huge funding it is getting for propaganda, derailing, and downright shit-slinging from huge corporate financial backers.)
Bitcoin has some problems to face (corporate control not the least of them!) but to turn the entire thing over to a tiny dev team is a ludicrous idea.

@_date: 2017-04-12 13:46:04
In the context of cryptocurrency, "decentralization" is a term referring to mining power and nodes.  It has zero to do with software.
Only people supporting hostile hijacking attempts such as XT, Classic, and now Unlimited try to use the phrase incorrectly like BU does,
in an attempt to hide their incredibly shady behavior.
Mr. Back is very correct, but he didn't go far enough.
@_date: 2016-02-19 06:50:19
It is absolutely class warfare. This is a much bigger problem than inequality of any other demographic.  It is also brutally driven by expert propaganda, as you say.
So, so many people have no clue how they are being used, and will apologies and fight for the very things that hurt them (and the rest of us) the most.  :(
Naturally, the tiny minority of super-wealthy parasites profit enormously. Now more than ever.  If we don't find a way to stop it, our grandchildren have a very, very bleak future.
@_date: 2016-12-05 11:48:25
Dude, you and your little PC have no way to compete with huge racks of special-built mining gear.
Increasing max block size only benefits them infinitely more than you or me. This is why there are so so few independent, individual miners anymore. If anything people join mining pools.
The competition is already way too much for any one individual to hope for making any kind of profit alone.
Also, it has to do with network and power efficiency, not HDD space.
Increasing max block size increases their profits. This can never be bitcoin's first priority.
Any such increase needs to be done very carefully, and only after protections are in place to prevent even more centralization. Actually, more efficient use of blocks is a far better idea.
SegWit is a very good example of such a plan. More efficient use of blocks.

What complete and utter nonsense.
Altcoins have their own blockchain. There are no "alternative clients", so stop with this idiotic idea.

I'm really curious what actual points you have against bitcoin, and why the "classic"coin team should take over the project.

Altcoins are great, but this hostile takeover attempt by some tiny, but obviously very well funded few devs is not to be taken seriously as anything other than a threat.
Classic coin needs its own blockchain, simple as that. Leave bitcoin out of it. Only then can it be respected and taken seriously.

Nothing the con artist Ver says can be taken as serious.
His hijack attempt with XT failed, Classic too,
The Unlimited scam is a bunch of hot air. 
Even if BU went live (never happen) they'd be shown as the complete joke they are.  
This was never Ver's objective.
He knows full well that UnlimitedCoin, like the scams before it,  is a complete joke that nobody would ever buy. 
This is why he never produces a legitimate altcoin.

What is "blockstream coin"? I thought we were talking about this new startup "classiccoin" that has been spamming this, and so many other bitcoin forums, trying for a hostile takeover of bitcoin's infrastructure (blockchain).
If it is a different project, they need their own *blockchain* too, as does any cryptocurrency project that wants to be taken seriously. Every altcoin (including bitcoin) has it's own blockchain. 
Even Dogecoin is fully respectable and proper in this regard.
@_date: 2016-02-21 14:56:39
err.. A fork has a specific meaning in open source software.
What is extremely shady about what Classic Coin is doing is trying to take over the bitcoin blockchain instead of using their own like any respectable altcoin. There is zero conjecture there.
It's sad that so many people (that don't understand how this stuff works) are influenced by the massive propaganda machine of a tiny dissenting dev team, fully intent on a hostile takeover of the bitcoin blockchain, paid for by huge corporate backing.
The only conjecture here is why anyone should take this seriously? 
I still have seen no real reason to turn control of Bitcoin over to a tiny team of devs that want to take over the blockchain.
**What is the huge and knowledgeable bitcoin dev team doing so, so wrong that inordinate risk is necessary?**
@_date: 2016-02-12 07:08:35
What has been going on can in no way be described as "building a consensus".  What has been going on is a tiny handful of devs trying to fordably hijack the bitcoin blockchain, along with a huge propaganda campain paid for by their wealthy backers.
The entire thing stinks to high hell. Completely untrustworthy behavior.  Even if they did the right thing and got their own blockchain, as it should be, I'd not trust them anymore.
@_date: 2016-02-06 02:01:17
"have competition" and "be replaced" are completely opposite sides of the spectrum. They in no way have anything in common.
To say that some startup altcoin can dictate where the mother project goes works completely against bitcoin's (and any such project's) decentralized nature. Give us true choice, true competition. The best currency will win. 
Dumping huge funding (from dubious sources, for dubious reasons) into the blatant propaganda and strong-arm tactics we see here, and on other bitcoin forums, is simply inexcusable. It is the largest threat to everything such technology based currencies have to offer.
Trying to spin such an aggressive takeover attempt into "pro-choice" is not only completely absurd,
it reeks of astroturf.  It is not hard to imagine who is really behind this push to kill off bitcoin, or what their motivation is. Many hate the fact that it is so hard to control, compared to the normal fiat currencies.
Such aggressive takeover attempts are not to be trusted in the least. So say I.
@_date: 2017-04-13 10:22:06
This sounds fun to set up. Have seen the how-tos on it.  
How much HDD space did you need once the blockchain was all loaded up?
Umm.. I mean just for Bitcoin. 
Seems the biggest drawback is the upload bandwidth, which I read can be throttled. 
OP's solution is bad-ass, and could probably do more, 
but it's also interesting that a simple RasPi3 and some HDD space can run a full node.
@_date: 2017-04-29 03:16:51
There is zero benefit to "working with" scam artists running hostile takeover attempts.
You also don't "work together" with spam when throwing it in the bin.
@_date: 2016-02-11 19:25:38
What they want is to completely take over the bitcoin blockchain. This would be laughable if not for the enormous and shady financial backing behind it (and the obvious and plentiful shills it pays for on many public forums, including here.)
This hostile "classic" altcoin takeover attempt has no credibility, simply because of their destructive behavior. If they made a proper fork, an altcoin, as "classic" coin is by all rights, it might have been worthy of trust.
@_date: 2016-02-21 19:17:33
The Classic coin team is tiny.  Anyone that has any idea about what is actually going on knows this.
That you are even asking such a question...
@_date: 2016-02-22 23:43:46
There are no two sides.
Scaling is being worked on by the dev team already.
@_date: 2016-02-21 20:18:20
btw, the blockchain and open source programming is the actual technology we are discussing.
Who you know is uninteresting and irrelevant.
WHAT you know might be interesting, if you care to share it.
Until now, you're just spewing shaming attempts and nonsense, like the tiny minority of "hard fork" fanatics that offer no real reasons.
Altcoins need their own blockchain.  
@_date: 2017-04-12 00:37:41
Simply that this is proprietary, controlled by people that have clearly shown
 they are completely untrustworthy. That is more than enough.
@_date: 2016-02-01 06:26:56
Just another altcoin. There are tons of them.
@_date: 2017-04-09 20:46:25
Zero need for this.  
BU has no teeth.  Even unscrupulous  miners are barking in the dark.  
Zero need for a hard fork to fix a hostile hijacking attempt. 
Cary on Bitcoin.  Segwit or status quo.  Those are the realistic options.   
Segwit would be better, but as it is, Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2016-02-11 20:18:34
The Classic coin code is built on Bitcoin, but they are trying to use the same blockchain as bitcoin.
This is the entire point.  It is an aggressive takeover attempt. This tiny group of devs, with huge financial backing, are trying to hijack the infrastructure the parent coding project has built up over years.
Bitcoin also has a very large and knowledgeable dev team. If this new classic coin startup succeeds in destroying the original project, stealing Bitcoin's blockchain, it will be the death of Bitcoin. 
The two currencies are incompatible, they have no business on the same blockchain. 
This is a very simple concept to understand.
@_date: 2017-04-13 16:11:15
SegWit already has a blocksize increase included.
Demanding *another* increase on top of that is ridiculous.
There is zero actual, legitimate reason for it.
Lots of nefarious, destructive reasons for it though, as the disreputable mining conglomerates such as Jihan Wu have clearly shown.  Increasing max block size willy-nilly as they'd so love will do nothing more than increase centralization of mining power.  Pushing smaller miners out of the picture, encouraging already too powerful ones to further their desired monopoly.  
This cannot be allowed, and will not.
Please stop spreading the disinformation you hear on that cesspool /btc
@_date: 2016-02-12 22:09:11
Maybe you haven't noticed the huge amount of propaganda and shit-slinging going on all over the internet bitcoin forums (reddit included here) about it?
There is very obviously a huge amount of advertising money coming from somewhere to influence public opinion.
The real debate is, why does the classiccoin team find it nessicary to kill off the parent project, instead of making a respectable altcoin?
What is so bad about Bitcoin, and it's dev team, that it needs to be hijacked?
@_date: 2016-02-22 07:02:06
This is the reality of the situation.  It is really a non-issue.
The massive corporate backing with an interest to control are pouring tons of publicity money into propaganda on bitcoin forums all over the place. No actual, credible reason for it. It is a very obvious control grab.
@_date: 2016-02-12 19:00:58
The myriad of cryptocurrency projects out there, all with their *own blockchain* offer true choice. Actual competition is good for everyone.
A hostile takeover attempt (ClassicCoin) of another's established *infrastructure* (BitCoin) is completely anti-competitive and destructive.
Fork away, but do it on your own blockchain, with your own forums, and unique name. Anything less is completely disrespectful to the entire community.
Bitcoin and it's devs are just fine. If you want Bitcoin to go in a different direction, a hostile takeover attempt only proves how untrustworthy that aggressive team is. Intelligent discussion is the way, not such blatant propaganda such as "classic" is guilty of.
"Classic"coin's tiny dev team, and their huge financial backing, should be held under intense scrutiny.
@_date: 2016-02-16 16:49:09
Smart contracts, payment chanel protocols, sidechains...
Why don't people simply use fiat?  Start loading bitcoin down with all this crap and it will become basically the same useless thing.
@_date: 2016-02-11 19:39:38
Can Bitcoin and "classic" altcoin co-exist? 
Are the currencies compatible?  No, they are not, therefore, there is nothing like a fork being attempted. It is a total takeover attempt. It means a huge disruption for the bitcoin parent project's infrastructure (blockchain). 
The ridiculous question of "majority" simply demonstrates this point.
If the "clasic" altcoin project wanted anything but a total takeover of the parent project, they would have *their own blockchain*. Only then would they be worthy of respect or trust.
As it is, with this incredibly destructive and aggressive takeover attempt, they are not even a reputable altcoin, they are simply destructive.
If people choose their project, it will be on separate blockchains. Now it's a little late for that. Anyone paying attention cannot trust such shady behavior. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 19:04:48
There is plenty of choice. Altcoins galore, all with their own blockchain. 
If ClassicCoin wants to be taken seriously, actually offer true competition and choice, they would have their own already.
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:54:20
Indeed, and those that know what the two mean do.
There are obvious and abundant shills payed to confuse the two on many public cryptocurrency forums. Reddit is no exception. Keep talking tech truth Mr Cypher.  Inform the masses of what the difference is.  
There is not so much an altcoin Fork here , as a destructive takeover attempt.
"Classic" coin cannot be called a true alternative until they act like one.
@_date: 2016-02-22 06:58:05
What is clear is that there is no chance of ever being anywhere near even 75%.  What is also clear is that there is a TON of publicity money pouring into propaganda to make it seem as if this is actually a thing.
What there is an almost complete lack of, is scientific evidence, or even intelligent reason behind it.
@_date: 2016-09-10 20:56:21
There are no misunderstandings.  They do need their own blockchain. By all rights, it very well should be an altcoin.
That they are hijacking the resources of a completely seperate cryptocurrency project shows how disingenuous they are. Total lack of integrity.
Add to that the fact that their scheme adds zero value. If it did, they could simply put in a pull request to bitcoin and it would be implimented.
Instead they are doing this shady shit, hacking into the bitcoin blockchain. they have no business touching any other project.
It is not just that I don't like it, it is that it is destructive to bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general.
It seems to me you need to look into how this sillyness actually works. It offers no advantage, just a lot more complexity. 
@_date: 2016-09-21 15:05:55
Let them, just let them use their own damn blockchain for such experiments. 
Piggybacking on on another project's resources (blockchain) is only detrimental. Such crap is to be discouraged with extreme prejudice in any open source project.
If they were actually interested in producing value, instead of get-rich-quick bullshit, they'd start an altcoin (which, by all rights, such schemes are), instead of constantly spamming tinfoil hat theories of some huge "consensus issue" that never was.
If their altcoin had more to offer, we'd all use it instead. Competition is good.
Hijacking another project's name and resources is shady as fuck, especially with all the spam and shit-sliinging we've seen these last months. Not only here.
@_date: 2016-09-29 12:51:25
Yes, this is an extremely abusive attempt to hijack another crytptocurrency's resources (blockchain) as well as falsely stealing their good name and reputation.
Lightning has nothing to do with bitcoin. Zero integrity, zero trustability.
If they wanted to actually be taken seriously, they'd use their own blockcahin, and stop spamming legitimate bitcoin forums with their get rich quick schemes.
@_date: 2016-02-12 22:20:51
It is an attempt to completely control the parent project's infrastructure... why is this necessary?
The two currencies are incompatible. For this new upstart to live, Bitcoin must die.
What is so horrible about bitcoin and its very large dev team, that a tiny handful of devs (albeit with huge corporate backing) need to sudenly be given complete power?
This is the question nobody is talking about.
@_date: 2016-09-30 00:14:47
Won't happen, as anyone that has actually looked into this ridiculous idea knows.
Time to shut up about it is right. Stop spamming actual cryptocurrency forums with such get-rich-quick scams.

bye now.
@_date: 2016-09-28 21:23:34
It offers nothing over bitcoin itself, except for another level of complexity. It offers more problems than it (falsely) claims to fix.
If as many people used this scheme as bitcoin, it would produce exactly the same delayed transaction times it claims to fix, plus less secure transactions. That time gap could give the other party an opportunity to yank the coins out of the "escrow" it holds them in. 
The entire thing is pretty ridiculous. Fortunately, not many people will actually use it anyway. The vast majority of people talking for it are paid shills. 
Anyone that looks into how it actually is suppose to work can clearly see it's just a get-rich-quick scam with large corporation funding.
@_date: 2016-09-27 17:36:49
This discussion doesn't even belong on a bitcoin forum. 
It's an altcoin, and needs its own forum. definitely its own blockchain.
This obviously failing experiment is hard to take seriously. Waste of space here.
@_date: 2016-09-08 08:41:39
It has no business using the bitcoin blockchain. Hijacking another project's resources like that is horrible behavior.

So funny, and so true.
ahh I remember when I bought a bunch at $200, and it instantly nosedived.
I was sure it was all my fault, but then another redditor said they did the same, 
so,  I'm pretty sure they're responsible that time.
In any case, this is a nice opportunity to stock up on more.  The days of $200,  or o0 $20 are LONG gone.
Might never see 3,400 again either. 
@_date: 2016-02-28 14:34:23
Meaning they are just cluttering up the blockchain. :(
On bitcoin forums all over the internet (here included) there is a ton of shilling and propaganda being spewed, in a desperate attempt to make "classic coin" seem like a thing.
Very little actual discussion or intelligent issues pointed out. Mostly just a whole heap of shit-slinging. It's been a pest here the last few months.
Pretty obvious there's a lot of money being poured into the propaganda. This is common on reddit, but still annoying as hell.

Then it has absolutely no use.
Minus value in itself, and hijacking another project's infrastructure to make some quick money.

Huge waste of resources for all but a few profiteers at the top.
@_date: 2016-09-29 12:56:49
I suggest you actually learn a bit about cryptocurrency, then ask a specific question. The info is all out there, and the vast majority of the cryptocurrency community know what's up with this silly scheme of theirs.
There is already tons of info out there. There is nothing of any real world benefit, and the more people abusing the bitcoin blockchain with this Lightning project only damage all cryptocurrency projects.
Thankfully, there isn't any actual interest in it, for very good reasons, despite what their desperate propaganda attempts assert.
@_date: 2016-09-11 21:09:25
And I say again, it *should* be.
They have no business hijacking the resources of another project.
Shady, shady business right there.
Not to mention their tech offers no answers, and only adds useless complexity.


this is not actually true.  You've got a much bigger chance of losing your money using lightning. Something that cannot happen using bona fide bitcoin.
Every write needs to go through the blockchain to be confirmed anyway. It adds zero to the equation, except complexity and risk.
@_date: 2016-09-22 09:33:39
It sounds like you need to learn a bit more about how cryptocurrency works before talking here.
This is a serious forum, and people do actually know how these things work.
Such abuse like you're dishing out, not to mention the blatant disinformation, is nothing but spam. We've seen entirely too much of it lately here, and other legitimate bitcoin forums.

Sorry, that's not how open source works.

Nonsense.

I must have misunderstood.  Did you just seriously try to compare Bitcoin to Ver's Bcash scam?
Bitcoin is a bona fide cryptocurrency.
BCash is nothing more than a get-rich-quick scheme. It is not a legit crypto. Ver hardly even has a dev team.  There is no comparison in "profitability", because all BCH has going for it is a scam.
@_date: 2016-09-22 18:17:22
It's quite impossible to talk to people that just repeat blatant disinformation. 
Please stop repeating the nonsense that fills /btc. It is only counter-productive.
Again, there never was any kind of dilemma, let alone this rediculous assertion of "war".  No, there never was any huge split in the community. That is entirely propaganda with zero base in reality.
There are concerns with scaling, and they are being very well addressed by the large and knowledgeable bitcoin dev team.
Willy-nilly increasing block size, with no protections against even further mining centralization only encourages a 51% attack. This would be death for any cryptocurrency project.
Other cryptocurrency projects promoting such a path are to be held in extreme suspicion. They are working for nothing other than their own greedy profit.
People promoting such insanity either don't (yet) know enough to recognize they've been duped, or are under the pay of such scam artists.  We've seen way too much of such here lately. :(

Seriously? you read my post 2 levels up, and that is just the technical side of things.
Their scheme offers zero advantage, exactly as already explained. What are you actually asking here?
Even further, a cryptocurrency project (Lightning) trying to hijack the resources of another project (Bitcoin blockchain) for their own profit is extremely shady business. 
This destructive behavior is to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
And then there is the huge corporate backed disinformation and propaganda campaign being waged on legitimate bitcoin forums (not only here), to influence less knowledgeable people.
The entire thing stinks to high hell. 
@_date: 2016-09-21 15:19:36
Nobody was ever going to go with some minuscule dev team, using their corporate backers to push the massive spam and blatant disinformation we've seen here, and other respectable bitcoin forums, so much lately.
There is zero value to upping the blockchain max size unless we have very strong protections in place against even further increasing the problem of mining power centralization.
No matter how much money they pour into propaganda to try to get people to believe in the "issue". There never was a "split". There never was any honest question of "consensus", whatsoever.
There is no nuance. It is a greed and profit produced drama with zero fact behind it.
@_date: 2016-09-10 06:42:24
"regular users"   heh,
Some tiny handful of confused people, sadly fooled by corporate shills. 
Once people do the tiniest bit of actual research, quickly learn, like the vast majority of people with actual knowledge of cryptocurrency, that Lightning and other get-rich-quick schemes, and the puppets &amp; useful idiots that promote them, are to be ignored or downright shunned.
Also, again, lightning has zero to do with bitcoin developers. It is a project that directly hijacks and wastes the resources (blockchain) of a completely separate cryptocurrency project (bitcoin).
This shady behavior is frowned upon and fully deserves to be.

@_date: 2016-09-07 21:47:06
Oh really now?  I think you're the one that needs to do some reading.
This tech is piggybacking off of bitcoin's blockchain. Using it in a *way* that has nothing to do with bitcoin.
That in and of itself is shady as hell and is to be discouraged with extreme prejudice. They need thier own blockchain if they want to do this. That would be respectable. Lightning coin is, by all rights, an altcoin, they just refuse to act as such. Despicable behavior right there.
It still has all the drawbacks of bitcoin, and none of the protections that the large and knowledgeable dev team provide. If the lightning yahoos wanted a shred of credibility, they would make a pull request to the bitcoin project. Instead they have hacked together a way to hijack bitcoin's already established infrastructure. This is aggressive and destructive.
The whole thing is just a shady money grab.  If everyone used this it'd be a disaster. All the same "problems" we have now, plus tons more complexity... all so a tiny handful of people can get rich.
There is zero benefit to this project, unless, possibly, they do the right thing and use their *own* blockchain.
@_date: 2016-09-22 17:57:00


Really dude, give it up. This is the exactl opposite of reality.

The bitcoin devs are doing a fine job. 
Well, except for the miniscule group that are trying to stage an agressive takeover of bitcoin infrastructure, when really they need to just make their own.
Arguing for a "constructive takeover" and "free from control of any individual group" do not fit togeather whatsoever. The irony is clear as day.   And we see such arguments trumped out again and again.
The group attempting the hostile takeover is tiny, but with obviously hefty financial backing. I have no doubt there are shills galore plying the public with such propaganda.
The insane amounts of propaganda and straight up abuse being flung around on here, and on other bitcoin forums, aggressively pushing for this total defunct of the core mods in favor of some tiny new altcoin (that isn't even acting as a beneficial, competetive altcoin) cannot be trusted.
In short, I call bullshit.
@_date: 2016-09-11 06:57:49
No, I'm saying that it is very shady and bad form to hijack the resources and name of other projects for your own project's profit.
Lightning has no business using bitcoin's blockchain. Or, would your "places" support the idea of letting just any cryptocurrency project abusively pile onto one blockchain like they are?
The entire idea is so nonsensical. This kind of nefarious activity is damaging for any cryptocurrency project not designed for it. (and who the hell would do that, unless purely for research, or a joke?)
Now, to provide real value, lightning has had every opportunity to use their own blockchain, or submit a pull request to the bitcoin project.
If they had done either of those, they could be seen as respectable.
They have not and will not, so are not, in any way, respectable. 
Again, this is the moralistic side of things. That their project actually has no intrinsic value of its own is another point.
(well, except for the profits of the ones that are driving that shady business)
This is not a complex idea.

There is nothing but logic in what I say.  
I can't be 'proven' wrong, because hardly anyone will even try this failure of an experiment. If they did it would be a disaster, but we'll never see it in real life, because anyone that knows how how it works has laughed it off long ago.

Rabid?  I'm sorry, no.. Just being objectively honest.
There is nothing it has that improves on bitcoin.  Anyway, why is this in a bitcoin forum?  Doesn't it have it's own, as any respectable altcoin should?
Or are they still trying to say they have something to do with bitcoin itself?  I thought that was all hashed out long ago.
@_date: 2016-09-11 07:24:53
lightning is doing nothing more than adding completely useless complexity on top of bitcoin.
Also, hijacking another project's infrastructure for their own greedy profit.
They offer no solutions to any of the problems they claim to. If they did, they would either use their own damn blockchain, or actually make a pull request to the project they are currently so destructively leeching off of (bitcoin)
Your, and their idea of implementing "layers" has nothing to do with the ideas Satoshi was talking about.
You have unfortunately fallen victim to some get-rich-quick scam artists.  I strongly urge you to go back and do some actual research into open source projects, and cryptocurrency.
Please do not spread such disinformation and propaganda.
The shady behavior this lightning project is displaying is discouraged with extreme prejudice by the open source community, and for damn good reason.
@_date: 2016-09-21 13:06:21

This type of profit-driven propaganda is spammed so often, it really is a joke at this point
There never was any danger of a "split", but damn, some tiny minority sure is dumping tons of money into advertising that it is an actual issue.
Anyone actually paying attention, that knows a bit about cryptocurrency, sees this disinformation for exactly what it is.
Greedy power-grab tactics directly damaging to cryptocurrency and bitcoin.

That is completely false. Please stop spreading such blatant disinformation.
@_date: 2016-09-11 07:08:43
From the perspective of the victim project, the parasite project hijacking their well established infrastructure and name is detrimental.
If lightning wanted to be taken seriously, they'd have their own blockchain, or submit a pull request to the bitcoin project, that they are abusing.
All anyone needs to know: lightning produces no value. It depends on stolen resources for its pretend value. The tech is actually, in fact, completely worthless. Less than even. It is only another layer of complexity with zero answers to  anything they *claim* to be fixing.

I'm fully happy with a deal like that. Much better than international transfer fees banks charge for their "service" (which is also only numbers moving around).

@_date: 2018-03-29 13:43:39
Bcash isn't even a legitimate altcoin, nor fork, and it's not even useful as a cryptocurrency.  
All it is, is yet another one of Ver's lame attempts at a hostile takeover.
There is one Open Source Bitcoin project, and Ver has never contributed anything to it whatsoever. Quite the opposite, he constantly and consistently attacks it.

@_date: 2016-09-22 09:31:52
Increasing block size indescriminately, as you and your ilk are promoting, with zero protections against further mining power centralization, was never part of that discussion,
until recently. 
This kind of talk is spammed by get rich quick artists that would love to use cryptocurrency as just another easy to control fiat scam.
If increasing max block size is to be done, it needs to be very carefully, intelligently, and exclude the deadly risk of a 51% attack.
This is what the bitcoin dev team is working on. There is no issue, nor was there ever a real question of "consensus" like the scam artists spam.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:21:57

@_date: 2016-09-07 21:58:21
no, not "almost everyone". At all.   Just a few handful of people that have (sadly) been fooled, and a ton of shills paid for by such shady projects.
Reality is, almost everyone here on this and other respectable bitcoin forums, know what's really up. 
Lightningcoin has zero benefit to bitcoin. It is an aggressive hack that hijacks another project's already established infrastructure.
If, by some insane turn of events, everyone started using this crap, we'd be in much worse shape. It solves nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:47:05

You are supporting the notion that this rediculous spam about "war" in the community has anything to do with reality.
This is not a caricature, it is something you actually said. 
Insisting on this blatantly false misinformation earns you the label of either ignorant on the subject, or liar.

btw, kinda funny you saying I'm "not very surviving" and complaining about coherency in the same sentence. heh
@_date: 2016-09-22 09:23:41
Possible, maybe, but completely unrealistic.
We already have too much centralization of mining power.
Larger block size only encourages even larger centralization, putting the little guy at an even greater disadvantage.
The threat of a 51% attack is one that cannot be ignored.
There are already powerful players that would love to destroy or co-opt cryptocurrency. Turn it into another fiat scam for profit. 
Increasing block size indiscriminately, with no protections in place, only makes their job much easier.
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:10:52
Nice!  Time to stock up on more.
@_date: 2016-09-11 07:14:28
the software (code base) is not the issue here.
An open source project's *resources*, name and infrastructure (blockchain) are. 
The two are not the same in any way. Please go back and learn a bit about open source software, as you have been led astray by disinformation and propaganda spammed by shady, get-rich-quick artists.
lightning is in no way independent, any more than a leech is. If they were (had their own blockchain, or actually contributed to the bitcoin project), they would be respectable. As it is, they are only abusing another cryptocurrency project.
(Aside from that, the tech itself is worthless. They have no answers to any of the problems they claim to, only more complexity.)
Such crappy behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in the open source community.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:45:59
If a serious crypto business can't survive without scummy click ads, they're not serious.

"3rd hand"   riiiiight dude.

You suggest I ask people promoting that crap some questions?  We already have enough spam and blatant disinformation here.

@_date: 2016-09-08 08:40:07
You're going to have to do better than "incorrect".
Lightningcoin clients work out a payment between themselves, but then use another project's infrastructure to transfer coins.
The coin transfer needs to happen sometime. This leads to the exact same "problems" with bitcoin that they so fallaciously assert to solving, plus a ton of unnecessary complexity to boot.
The transactions are in no way instant. Every transaction still needs to wait to be verified through the actual bitcoin blockchain. It's all smoke and mirrors.
Lightning coin offers zero benefit, and is hijacking resources from another project. One or the other are bad enough.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:53:35
There are no "two sides".
There is the Bitcoin Open Source project,
and shady bad actors trying to hijack it.
Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have constantly been on the attack for decades now.

There is only one Open Source Bitcoin project.  One.

In fact, that kind of detestable behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source.
Ver's BCH isn't even a legit crypto, nor altcoin. It has no technical value except as a get-rich-quick scam, like all the other garbage Ver has come out with over the years.

@_date: 2018-02-07 11:59:42
1. It is extremely shady business to try and hijack the resourses of another project. Such scummy outfits that do are shunned with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crpto.
2. BCH has only a handful of devs, working directly for the gangster VER, that have proven themselves incompetent again and again.
3. The vast majority of miners and nodes dealing in his scam coin are operated by a pittifully small handful of people, most notably, the disreputable miner Jihan &amp; his goons.
BCH has no worth as a bona fide cryptocurrency. Their "scaling" model is DOA, and the Bcash devs couldn't even figure out how to increase block size on their own.  Embarrassing, and would be laughable if they weren't doing people real, concrete harm with this scam coin.
It cannot be called an altcoin. It is a get-rich-quick scam, through and through.

What 2x is, is just another scam by Jihan and a few other bad actors. In no way any type of "compromise". If anything just a way to save face when threatened with a UASF.
It is designed to put total control of Bitcoin in a few hands.
It is also a completely ridiculous idea. Nobody in their right mind is going to trust their money to a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control.

Ver can't get anyone worthy to even work for him.  Give it a break man.
The  yahoos he had at the beginning couldn't even figure  out how to increase block size!  lol
All the people in on BCH are just as shady as Ver is.  Nobody worthy will eve touch him, becauase he's done nothing but spit in the face of Open Source, Crypto, and specifically Bitcoin.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, bch1, 2x,  now bcash / BCH...  none have any technological worth as actual cryptocurrencies.
and the shady behavior... trying to steal the name and reputaion of the parent project... such shit is shunned by every  development community.  Not only open source, not only crypto.
it is not "illegal", punishable, in the Open Source world, 
but it is the reason that Ver is known as the  asshole he is for trying such bullshit.. again and again.
He and his cronies have zero legitimay, integrity, or technological prowess, whatsoever.  This he has proven again and again.

You see this propaganda a lot from people pushing Ver's latest scam coin. They also spout a lot of other disinformation that is completely counter to reality. 
There is no huge banning problem here.  There is, from time to time, a problem with FUD spread by Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. though.

This is despicable behavior, and detested with a passion in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
Ver has no claim to the name Bitcoin whatsoever. He has never contributed one line of code to the project.  All he has done is, again and again, staged hostile takeover attempts against it.
Just like Jihan with his btc1, BCash and 2x scams.

What there is, pure and simple is:

Very obvious and abundantly clear.  You've been offered a plethora of technological arguments against, shooting down your tired old propaganda rhetoric again and again.
give it a rest Mr. Z.  People here do know what's up, and we've heard it all before, and have shot it all down, also, again and again.
BCH is not the first of Ver's scam coins, it will probably not be the last,  but they get much easier to spot with every attempt.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:10:15
Don't forget that with every new scam coin Ver puts out, with every new promotion push, we see Jihan mining tons of garbage blocks to clog up the mempool.
When Jihan &amp; his goons stop that nonsense,  it clears up very quickly.

Bcash was never even a legitimate altcoin.  It has no dev team to speak of, no future, it is not worth anything as an actual cryptocurrency.
The only thing BCH was good for was yet another of Ver's pump-n-dump scams.  Good riddance.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:48:26
Trying to hijack the resources of another project (like name, symbols, in this case blockchain too) is looked down on with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto, and for damn good reason.
Ver pulling this shady shit with BCH just proves he has zero credibility or integrity. And Bcash is just the latest in a long line of such scams of his.  XT, Classic, Unlimited, mixed up in Jihan's scams btc1 &amp; 2x, and now Bcash.  
Not to mention that BCH has hardly any dev team to speak of. The few yahoos that he can get to work for him (working directly for Ver, mind you, another very bad thing) have shown themselves to be completely incompetent again and again. They couldn't even figure out how to increase block size!
BCH is not an altcoin, it has no worth as an actual cryptocurrency. What it is, is simply yet another get-rich-quick scam from a known bad actor (Roger Ver).
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:26:12
Very easily.  Ver and his scam site are built around the whole scam of stealing people's money just like that. Deliberate lying.
The responsibility for that crime lies squarely on the shoulders of the scam artist, and the shady exchanges that promote his scam coins.
Don't try to blame the victim, or at least, go promote Ver's shitcoins over at his sub /btc. They're built on the same scam.
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:14:37
He's absolutely right.  Bad actors such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co love to spread propaganda about a "debate" and "sides", but they have no legitimacy whatsoever.
The only thing we've had are their agressive and destructive takeover attempts. 
They are directly against Bitcoin and the Crypto community in general, not to forget going directly against Open Source.
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:16:54

This is not happening.  Zero emergency.  And even IF there was,
handing Bitcoin over to shady characters such as Jihan,  Ver &amp; Co is the *opposite* of an intelligent answer.
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:52:05


This only describes the anti-bitcoin propaganda you're spewing here.
Take it back to /btc where such disinformation is welcome.
People here have been dealing with this nonsense for far too long to be taken in by such scams.  2x was DOA.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:44:31
Sure, and kidnappers demanding ransom have a "side" too.
Bad actors such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, as pointed out in the OP writeup, have no legitimate "side" to hear.
They have constantly, consistently worked to the detriment of Bitcoin, for their own greedy profit. Pure and simple.
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:47:36
If that means running software by a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control... you're a fool.
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust anything of worth to this 2x scam, unless they're in on it.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:22:36
This abusive victim blaming has no place here, or anywhere.
The responsibility for this scam lies squarely on Roger Ver's shoulders, and any shady exchange that promotes his scam coins.
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:28:43
software written by a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control is in no way


in any shape or form.  To trust them with anything of value would be insane.
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:45:17
Any Open Source project that attempts to steal the resources of the parent project is an attack. 
The source code is free to use for your *own* project. That means its own name, and blockchain. That is a legit altcoin, and welcome.
This is something that Jihan &amp; his goons are neither capable of technologically, nor interested in. Therefore they keep trying to hijack Bitcoin for their own greedy ends.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:05:33


completely false.  Bitcoin is Open Source.
What Ver is doing with his BCH scam is totally  against everything Open Source, and a direct attack against it.
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:30:37


Then those miners will soon be out of a job.
Nobody is going to trust anything of worth to a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control, regardless what fantasy some disreputable mining outfits and get-rich-quick scam artists have.
This 2x scam was DOA.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:11:05
zero reason for it.  
We have SegWit now, and don't even talk in block size anymore.
Block *weight* is the thing. Which just shows how out of touch such scam artists are.
If you want to change the rules, submit code to the Bitcoin project. The code repository is open for all to contribute.
Note: the bad actors such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co never have. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:43:24
If anything, it could be reasonably argued that 1mb is already too big.
Anyway, it's way too early to even consider any block size changes. 
All the new scaling methods that SegWit opens the door for need to be explored first.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:54:29


Oh dude, give it a break.
Ver, Jihan &amp; Co know *exactly* what they are doing.
BCH is not the first hostile takeover attempt they've run.
It is in no way subjective.  We've seen a LONG line of such scams come down the  line over the years.
It is anything but subtle and nobody is fooled anymore except the newbies that Ver and his goons target with their scams.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:36:42
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust anything of worth to a tiny handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control.
Not unless they're in on the scam.  We've seen this all too often before.
Bad actors pointed out in the OP writup have been working passionately to undermine and hijack Bitcoin. 
Such shady behavior is detested in all of Open Source, not just Crypto. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:27:51

@_date: 2017-10-07 10:16:13
Who's "word"?   Are you trying to claim that anyone actually agreed to this 2x scam?  It was a bunch of gangsters agreeing with themselves behind closed doors.
Even these bad actors couldn't stay faithful to the scheme they dreamed up.  Nobody else takes it seriously whatsoever, except as another in a long line of hostile takeover attempts.
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:29:53
the x2 scam was only to save face.  Jihan &amp; his goons were forced to signal SegWit because of the threat of a UASF. 
They tried to sneak yet another scam through with this 2x nonsense. It can safely be ignored.
Well, not entirely. We now have a list of companies that have outed themselves as completely untrustworthy. That is worth noticing  and acting on, as in, never doing business with them.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:07:25
Saying they don't want a new coin, but also that they don't want to use the Open Source Bitcoin project anymore, is nonsensical bullshit.
This 2x scam is nonsense. Nobody in their right mind is going to use code from a handful (if that) of incompetent devs under Jihan's control.
The entire thing was DOA.  Who cares what corporate big-wigs with no clue want?  
Let them try, and fail, as have the others:  XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, Bcash, now x2...
All these hostile takeover attempts have no legitimacy or merit. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:57:11
Neither BCash, nor this 2x scam are legitimate altcoins. 
They are not bitcoin either.
All they are is hostile takeover attempts.
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:41:32
Good wallets let you choose what nodes to use.  Simply use ones that only run bona fide Bitcoin.
Starve the vermin running the 2x scam farms and they must perish.
Either that or Bitcoin could do a POW change, which would be heavy-handed, but better than seeing Bitcoin die.

@_date: 2017-09-07 12:40:27
No, the only miners blockin SegWit were unscrupulous shady outfits under Jihan's thumb.  Reputable miners were behind SegWit all along.
The 2x fiasco was just a way to save face when thretened with a UASF.  The community told Jihan &amp; Co. in no uncertian terms, Shape up or be Shipped OUT!
Jihan chose to shape up, but added one more scam to the long line of his, with the 2x silliness.
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:49:05

No, they keep trying, but they're not smart enough.
They can't even write their own altcoin. Huge failure at every step.

BTC is organic.
What is NOT is the constant attacks waged against it by bad actors such as the ones that signed this latest 2x scam.

@_date: 2017-09-30 08:54:28
There is zero need to give into the demands of gangsters behind the 2x scam.  
willy nilly increasing block size would just give them even more mining power centralization.  That is no answer at all.
Bitcoin is doing just fine. Nobody is going to use buggy, centrally controlled code from btc1. The entire thing is DOA.
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:52:31
Bitcoin is what Bitcoin users use.
You can't just come in and say "ok, I'm Bitcoin now!" and expect to be taken seriously, especially not with the track record of hostile takeover attempts that yahoos such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have.
They were told to ship up or be shipped out before, and can be again.  
They chose to shape up, instead of losing their shirts. They will again.

No, it's not a "perspective".  You lack information is all.
It is very clear and well known to the Bitcoin dev team, legitimate, trustworthy mining outfits, and the entire Bitcoin, Crypto and Open Source communities.
You insisting that *your* perspective, completely opposite so many knowledgeable and worthy contributors, is "the only one", is simply ridiculous.  Please stop that.
If you are actually honestly curious, and just naive on the subject, please inform yourself. (stay away from cesspools of disinformation such as /btc)
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:03:11
BCash cannot even be called a legit altcoin. It has no worth as a bona fide cryptocurrency.
Aside from the shady behavior of trying to hijack the name and resources of another Open Source project, 
it is technically a complete mess, has no logical scaling strategy, its minining and node power are dangerously centralized, and the few devs that Ver can get to work for him have proven themselves incompetent again and again.
There is no comparison between Ver's BCH scam and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:39:47
WTF is a bitcoin.COM article doing here?!

BCash is anything but reliable.  Ver has no dev team to speak of, and the few yahoos he *can* get to work for him have proven themselves incompetent again and again. They couldn't even figure out how to increase block size!
BCH has no value as an actual Cryptocurrency. It is simply another in a long line of Ver's get-rich-quick scams.

@_date: 2017-10-06 21:57:44
Judging by your posting history, you have zero honest interest in hearing anything but the propaganda and disinformation you've been freely slinging.
For those that might not know though,  larger block size means more cost for bandwidth.  This means that already dangerously large mining operations have a HUGE advantage.
If anything, it could be reasonably argued that 1mb is already too large.  SegWit has fixed that, but still we hear these ridiculous cries of "BIG BLOCKS!!!".  There is zero actual benefit at present. Quite the opposite.
Decentralization is key to the success, longevity and usefulness to crypto coins like Bitcoin.  Willy-nilly increasing block size (as Jihan &amp; his goons constantly have been pushing for) only increases their power. 
SegWit has activated now. There is ZERO need to even discuss larger blocks at present. Let alone the insane "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda such shady bad actors push.
IF there is a need, the Bitcoin devs are on it.  
This x2 gangster crew, desperately trying to hijack and take over the Open Source Bitcoin project, is directly spitting in the face of Crypto, and Open Source.
Such hostile takeover attempts are discouraged with extreme prejudice, for damn good reason.
None of these 2x scammers have any legitimacy, and should be avoided like the plague.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:52:54
This kind of destructive, shitty behavior is in no way "expected" in Open Source.  Exactly the opposite!
The source code is free to copy and use for your *own* project, this means with its own name, and in this case blockchain.
To try to steal the name and reputation of another Open Source project is discouraged with extreme prejudice.  Those that stoop to this deserve all the disdain they get.
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:36:37
The exact opposite is true.  
Being able to print money at whim, international banks completely controlling fiat, is bad for everyone but them.
(the "Federal Reserve" has nothing to do with our federal government)
It was much better when you could turn in your fiat and demand something of *actual* worth for it. AKA gold.  It kept them honest.

"simple" or cheap?
You can run a full bona fide Bitcoin node on a RasPi.  
As Mr. Decrypt says though, easier to do with windows.  That means more cost though.
Either way, running your own full node is very good. Not only can you verify your own transactions, you're helping the Bitcoin network stay decentralized. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:03:37


Bitcoin is Open Source software.  There is no difference.
Take your diatribe of disinformation back to /btc where you got it from.  or whatever cesspool of Ver's you came from.
Fork can be made internally by a project itself..
forking off into a SEPERATE NEW project, with its own  name and blockchian in this case.
What you are trying to call a "fork" is nothign more than a hostile takeover attempt.  This is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of  Open Source, not just Crypto.
after seeing the reems  of  text  you've invested in such absolute bullshit,  trying to call BCH a legit altcoin,  even the  actual Bitcoin,  it is impossible to believe that you do not know this.
It is impossible to believe, after seeing your misguided attempts at apologizing for Ver's latest scam, again and again, that you're not invested in the destruction of Bitcoin.

Lack of signalling does not guarantee lack of support.
The concensus was, and has long been, FOR SegWit. 
Only Jihan and other shady mining concerns under his control were holding things back.
His 2x scam had zero to do with anything. The threat of being put out of business by a UASF sure did though.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:19:25
There is no "opposite direction" except from shady bad actors such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
The ones that are so desperately trying to take over bitcoin,
with so very little worth.  They have no technological merit, and as far as their "projects" go,  they go against everything Open Sourse stands for.
Constanty, consistently trying to steal the name of another project. Steal it's symbols and blockchian.
If your precious Ver actually COULD produce a legitimate altcoin, he would call it by its own name, like any other altcoin of worth.
Radical changes?  lol  dude, BCH has no logical scaling plan.  The tiny handful of devs Ver has working for him have proven they have no clue again and again.  
We've seen a lot of blatant disinformation and propaganda here, promoting the likes of Bcash, but seldom has it been so completely lacking in effort.
You are wasting your employer's money.   Nobody is buying this snake oil.  
Take it back to /btc where it belongs.
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:37:47
No, there is no debate.  Bitcoin devs, community, and reputable miners all decided on SegWit long ago.
The only "debate" were lies pushed by bad actors such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, promoting their various scams (XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, X2, BCH)
BCash is not bitcoin, it is a hostile takeover attempt. Such shady business is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.

A database is what you need in a situation like that.
Using an "editable blockchain" would be idiotic when there are already much better solutions ready-made to deal with those needs.
There really is no sense to calling it a blockchain if it can be edited at will. Just more hype and buzzwords.
@_date: 2016-09-21 12:58:03

Increasing mining centralization is a huge problem.

@_date: 2017-10-22 20:07:47
He makes a good point.  It is the bandwidth they have available that is their greatest weapon though.
Computing power is a large factor too, considering the disreputable mining concerns that are behind such scams such as 2x &amp; Co. also have a shitload of it.  For all we know, the Chinese government itself is subsidizing their bandwidth.  It's well known they get their electric costs "for free".. meaning, they owe the government for them.
Jihan &amp; his cronies have done nothing but block Bitcoin progress for months and months. Spewing all manner of propaganda and "Big Blocks NOW!" disinformation.
Now that they stopped blocking Segwit, the consensus of reputable miners, devs, and the Bitcoin communtiy (thanks to the threatened UASF)..
**there is zero need to talk about big blocks, not until we explore all the awesome scaling tech that SegWit opened the door for.**  Anyone spewing such nonsense is just supporting their scams, and is to be held in the same low regard.
IF, someday, the danger of bigger blocks are deemed a worthy risk, the huge and knowledgeable Bitcoin dev team will do it, not shady gangsters like Jihan and his crew of bandits, nor any of the corrupt bad actors that signed the 2x scam.
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:06:31
The threat of a UASF worked wonders. 
It got Jihan &amp; his goons to shape up and stop blocking SegWit.
Of course, to save face, these untrustworthy goons tried to make their 2x scam a part of it, but that is just yet another hostile takeover attempt.
Who controls bitcoin?  The Bitcoin dev team.  If someone wants to submit code to the Bitcoin project, it's open for all to contribute to.
Note, the bad actors such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are neither capable, nor have any interest in such. They are only interested in their get-rich-quick scams.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:33:22
The cesspool of disinformation that is /btc is biased toward scam artists such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co that they represent / promote.
Calling out such (as is done here, and other legitimate Crypto forums all over the web)  is not biased, it is simply relaying the truth of the situation.
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:36:19


Oh god, take your ridiculous propaganda back to /btc where it's welcome.
Nobody is going to trust a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control.

@_date: 2017-09-30 07:41:54
A band of unscrupulous miners were blocking Bitcoin progress for months and months. The threat of a User Activated Soft Fork made them shape up. Either that or they'd have been shipped out.
So no, miners are not the last word. They need to produce a product people are actually interested in using.
Nobody in their right mind is willing to turn Bitcoin development over to a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control.  Well, unless they're in on the scam themselves.
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:01:35

Natural blowback from trolling, propaganda and actual shitposting from supporters of blatant scams (hi /btc) are seen also, but that is only natural when so consistently attacked.

@_date: 2018-02-07 11:51:45

Jihan's btc1 scam is in no way *participating* with the bitcoin project. It is directly attacking it.
He has zero claim to the name, nor blockchain. Has never contributed or participated in the Bitcoin project at all.
Again, stop spreading this blatant disinformation. his btc1 code base has nothing to do with bitcoin, except that it is trying to steal the name from the bona fide open source project.
As has been very clearly explains, this is extremely corrupt and despicable behavior. As is your insistence in spreading blatant FUD, even though told better.

Finally the Bad Actors such as Jihan &amp; his goons have been forced to shape up (under threat of being shipped out by a UASF).
SegWit is irrevocably activated, and that opens the door to all manner of safe and sane scaling tech.
Beware of those still promoting the insane "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda.   There be no talk of block size until all the awesome things to come have been explored.
Bitcoin is built and driven by slow, steady progress. No get-rich-quick scams can compete. 
There have been plenty of hostile takeover attempts... XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, 2x... but they have as little legitimacy as they have technological merit.  None.

What is not allowed is to try to hijack the name or other resources of an existing project, trying to pass yours off as the original.
Such shady shit is detested with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have not only never contributed one line of code to the Bticoin project, they have made careers trying to destructively take it over. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:21:03
Just as every other hostile takeover attempt has been denied Jihan, Ver &amp; Co all along.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCH, x2.   None of them have anything to do with Bitcoin except they are attempts to maliciously híjack it.
Doomed to fail from the start.  Nobody is going to run buggy code from a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control. His x2 scam was DOA.
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:43:42
You're basically advocating for people to give into ransom demands from kidnappers.
No, that's no way to run an Open Source project.
The scam artists behind 2x need to be shunned, and they will be. Simple as that.  Nobody is going to use their software, written by a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control.
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:59:26
He's been doing nothing but attacking Bitcoin, attempting an agressive takeover, for pretty much decades now.
Scams such as XT, Classic, Unlimited.... All directly aimed at get-rich-quick destruction.  He's trying to profit from killing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:34:37
There is absolutely no reason to accept the 2x scam.
SegWit is activated, with all the new tech it allows to scale, there is no reason to even consider the "Big Blocks NOW!" hype.
IF such a thing is proven to be necessary, the Bitcoin devs will do it. Safely, sanely, carefully.  As of now, there's no reason to.
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:45:40
Only in the context of being a threat to Bitcoin.
Lingham was trying to explain how such threats are somehow, magically a *benefit* to Bitcoin, which is exactly the opposite of the truth.
Businesses and mining outfits that are trustworthy &amp; reputable do not have power.  Ones that are hostile and try to attack are a different story.
Lingham just showed himself to be one of the latter.
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:35:12
And here we see, yet again, what shilling for such scams looks like.
In the face of facts and logical explanations about the technology, their conversation turns very quickly to personal attacks.  All disinformation and propaganda about this 2x scam is no different. When pointed out that it is just that, a scam, and explained how it is technically broken, their only answer is to attack or derail.
Such destructive shit slinging is typical M.O. from brigaders from shady forums such as /btc, and their consistent propaganda campaigns on legit crypto forums such as this one.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:30:58
Learn the first thing about how Open Source works before repeating such drivel.
Trying to steal the resources of another project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
The source code is open to use for your *own* project. Including own name, and in this case blockchain. Such legit competition is fully welcome and encouraged.
The 2x scam is noting of the sort. It is yet another in a long line of hostile takeover attempts.
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:26:43

@_date: 2017-09-28 21:14:14


False.  The Bitcoin project, trustworthy miners, and community are for longevity and usefulness. This is why shady gangsters such as those in this new x2 scam have been denied every time they try such underhanded bullshit.
(and there have been many:  XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, x2...)
The *code* is open for anyone to use for their *own* project. This mandates having its own name, blockchain, and other resources. AKA an altcoin. Such legitimate competition is very welcome.
Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are neither capable, nor at all interested in such. :(
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:40:29

This is exactly the argument Ver (falsely) uses when promoting one of his scams. BCH is only the latest.
It is completely untrue.  There is only one Open Source Bitcoin project. Anyone can use the source to create their *own* project, but that child project cannot be called Bitcoin.
This is how Open Source works.  Shady behavior like Ver, Jihan &amp; Co constantly trying to steal the resources of another project is shunned in all of Open Source, not just crypto.
IF Ver had the slightest interest, or capability of creating a legitimate altcoin (own name, own blockchain) that would be welcome. Competition is good.
He has neither interest, nor capability, so he constantly tries his hostile takeover attempts. Proving, again and again, that he is nothing more than a get-rich-quick scam artist.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:12:04
Anyone that signed the 2x scam deserves full scrutiny.  That was some shady shit.  Even if they pull out now, the fact that they were willing to destroy Bitcoin cannot be forgotten.

Here, you, and those you are promoting, are only talking about yourselves.
There is only one Bitcoin project. There only ever was one. It is open source.  Anyone can contribute.  
This definition of an open source project is held by not only myself, but the entire open source community.  High standards held by open source crypto projects worldwide.
The open source Bitcoin project is one of them.  
The ones that are directly against everything such open source ideals are about are greedy bad actors that push such scams as 2x, .. and the long list of others I've mentioned. 
What objective fact?  You've asked nothing, and said nothing, except a constant slew of either disinformation, or completel nonsense like that last post.
Either you have no clue what open source, crypto and bitcoin is, or you're being completely dishonest.
Considering who you're promoting with this nonsense... not hard to see which. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:40:34
BCash aka BCH is not a legitimate altcoin. It is directly attempting to hijack the resources of its parent project. This is despicable behavior, condemned in all of Open Source.
If Jihan, Ver &amp; Co actually offered legitimate competition with a bona fide Altcoin... hell if it was good (BCH is not) then I might even buy some.
They neither are capable, nor have any interest in, offering legitimate, fair competition with their own altcoin. All they've done is attempt to disrupt and hijack Bitcoin (as well as damaging other altcoins).
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:27:46


The writeup, if anything, was biased toward the attacker's side.
Unfair fairness given in calling their malicious takeover attempts a "debate".  
It's akin to calling for the kidnapper's side of the story after they demand the ransom.
This writeup is VERY good. For newcomers, and as a review of recent events for old hands.
It is very accurate (except for the too lenient "bias" noted.)
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:49:41

It has been a LONG time since he did anything good for Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-26 10:38:24
Because you're shamelessly promoting all kinds of nonsense supporting it. 
Coinbase can legally do what it wants, but supporting this 2x scam, or any other, proves they are completely untrustworthy. 
They've come up with a procedure that will cost their customers money. Selling 2x scam markers as if they were legitimate Bitcoin.
And don't start with any nonsense about a 51% attack being legitimate Bitcoin. There is only one Bitcoin project. If a 51% attack is sucessful, there will be no more Bitcoin, no matter what unscrupulous outfits like coinbase call it.
Do you realize who you're promoting? The same scam artists behind XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, Bcash, now 2x.
Do you know how many devs are working on 2x?  0. Zero. Zilch. The ONE dev they had flew the coop.
You are seriously wanting to turn Bitcoin development over to... Nobody, and laughably trying to call it "simple and reliable".
They are in no way using economics to filter out fake Bitcoin chains. They clearly said they will *fully support the fake.* Here, yet again, your agenda is clear as day in the language you're using. Bitcoin will always be Bitcoin, 2x will always be a scam. That has nothing to do with Open Source as you are fraudulently trying to portray it, quite the opposite.
And now, I'm tired of listening to this anti-Bitcoin, anti-Open Source tripe. 
Go sell the snake oil elsewhere, nobody here is buying.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:29:04


You are spewing line after line of disinformation directly AGAINST Bitcoin's scaling roadplan. 
Segwit and the scaling tech  that it enables *IS*  bitcoin progression.
BCash BCH is not even a legitimate altcoin.
it has no worth as a cryptocurrency.  It is simply another in a long line of Ver's get-rich-quick scams.
You think we have not seen this crapfest before?   many times.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, now BCH... none of them have anything to do with the Bitcoin Open Source project, except they are hostile takeover attempts on it.
It is EXTREMELY obvious when such brigades push such blatant disinformation and propaganda.
especially when the vote count gets skewed in favor of Ver's scams.
Yet, he tries again and agian,  and this sub is not the only crypto forum that is attacked by his shills.
This crap is spewed all over the web,  and we're all rather board by it.
Wander back off to /btc now.  Tell Ver &amp; Jihan that they need to get a new script.
Or, just maybe, actually start working FOR crypto, and make their own damn altcoin,
instead of constantly trying to hijack another.
@_date: 2016-09-10 21:23:29
It has been answered successfully, in favor of Lightning, exactly zero times.
It has been answered many times exposing lightning for the sham it is, at best, and destructive influence is more accurate.
Lightning project has no business hijacking another project's infrastructure. They SHOULD be an altcoin, with their own block chain. That they steal from another shows how lacking in any integrity they really are.
That's on the moral side. On the technology side their scheme also offers zero advantage.

2x is nothing more than a hostile takeover attempt.  Jihan &amp; his crew of gangsters have tried this many times.  This one is no different, except shady companies like Coinbase are trying to get a piece of the pie.
This, is what is obvious. The "direction" they want is a completely centrally controlled payment method.  
There are no two "sides".  There is bitcoin, and the scam artists attacking it. The 2x scammers have zero technical merit or moral integrity. They've shown this again, and again.
/btc is a launching pad for such scams. They have historically promoted every hostile takeover attempt to come down the line.

Again, the exact opposite of "expected" behavior.  
You could say that shady gangsters  are "expected" in any industry, but that has nothing to do with Open Source specifically.
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:48:22
What horrible advice. Especially with coinbase. They've come out saying they will support the 2x attack if it is successful. 
Completely untrustworthy.  Don't keep any more with them than you can afford to lose. 
That is good advice for any exchange, *especially* unscrupulous ones. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:39:21


Completely false.  The bitcoin, crypto and open source communtities have been against such attacks all along.  XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, 2x...
These are aggressive hijacking attempts, directly *against* Bitcoin and its community.
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:54:38
So long greedy mining outfits like Jihnan &amp; Co don't take over the system and completely centralize. 
Fortunately, there are many, many actually reputable mining outfits out there.  
This 2x scam isn't the norm for mining outfits.
Still, such gangsters are dangerous. We can't let mining dictate the course of Bitcoin, 
something the trustworthy ones also assert.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:19:18
This is a ridiculous argument from the start. There is only one Bitcoin project.
Them gambling on a hostile takeover of it (2x) being successful is exactly why they are untrustworthy.
Following the longest chain is their way of saying they support 51% attacks. :(
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:04:09
Most likely right.
Also, please don't call Bitcoin 1x.  There is no 1x.
That only lends legitimacy to the 2x scam, of which it has none.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:56:47
This 2x scam is not a legitimate fork. 
It is a hostile takeover attempt.  It has zero legitimacy.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:47:27
This is disgusting.  Any outfit trying to steal the name and reputation of another Open Source project, outs themselves as completely untrustworthy.

@_date: 2017-10-25 15:34:03
No, what they said is if this 2x (or presumably any other) attack is successful, they'll throw their BTC customers under the bus, just as Coinbase would.
In no way worthy of any thanks, nor trust.
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:11:52
Well, the largest exchanges have said that's what they are using.
De-facto official ticker.  
Good this way. Less likely to get the 2x scam mixed up with actual Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:40:38
"lots of people" wanting "BIG BLOCKS NOW!" is a huge, steaming pile of propaganda.
The vast majority of any of this crap comes from exactly the hostile takeover attempts we're talking about.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, 2x... none of them have any legitimacy. They are all hostile takeover attempts.
Not even bona fide altcoins.  Legit competition is encouraged.
Shady get-rich-quick schemes like the ones mentioned directly spit in the face of Crypto and Open Source in general.
IF we need big blocks, eventually, then the Bitcoin devs will do that.
For now, any talk of such is rediculous. SegWit and all the scaling strategies it has opened the door for are just beginning to be explored.
If it wasn't for shady scams like the ones mentioned, and disreputable outfits blocking Bitcoin progress so long, we'd be much farther.
Yes, this 2x is nothing but just another scam.  
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:37:59
The cesspool of propaganda and disinformation that is /btc has consistently supported, and brigaded for, every scam from Jihan, Ver &amp; Co that's come down the line.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, now 2x.
They and theirs are launchpads for such scams and have been a blight on the Bitcoin, Crypto and Open Source communities for years. Brigading with blatant lies, and when faced with facts, stooping to downright shit slinging and derailing maneuvers.
They and theirs have constantly attacked legitimate Crypto forums all over the web, this one included.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:31:38
No, it is still bias.
Calling out a kidnapper's unjust deeds while they're demanding a ransom would also be your version of "bias". 
Ridiculous.  These bad actors have been attacking bitcoin with hostile takeover attempts all along. There is no "side" for them to give. There is also no "debate".
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:41:07
It is unfairly slanted in that it calls the bad actors side of things a "debate".. 
as if gangsters such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have any legitimacy whatsoever.
Other than that, fully accurate.
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:10:15
The jargon "decentralization" in Crypto has nothing to do with the code.  It refers to mining hash power and node distribution. 
There is no "decentralization" of an Open Source project.  One Bitcoin, one code repository, and a large and knowledgeable dev team.
This blatant disinformation, trying to confuse the term with the code, has been tried again and again in an attempt to excuse hostile takeover attempts from bad actors. 
This 2x scam is no different. Jihan &amp; his goons have zero claim to the names Bitcoin or Segwit, nor to Bitcoin's blockchain. That has absolutely nothing to do with the phrase "decentralization".  This has been explained again and again, and will continue to be shot down as the dishonest propaganda it is.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:50:14
LOL  you, telling me to learn about bitcoin.
or anyone here..  
Sorry dude, all your support and love for Ver's BCH is lost here.
You are asserting that the  moon is made of green cheese.  
Again, BCH has nothing to do with Bitcoin. The scam site bitcoin.com, run by rodger ver is extremely abusive.  
The entire construct has no worthy tech  behind it. The handful of devs that Roger Ver has working for him, directly under his command, have proven themselves to be incompetent.
His insistence on trying to hijack the resources of an existing project proves his motives are nothing but bad.  
There is only one Bitcoin Open Source project. One, there can be no others.  
A legit altcoin would be welcome, but Ver has shown, again and again, that he neither has the interest, nor the capability of offering any contribution to Cyrypto. 
The people constantly pushing his propaganda and disinformation are no better.
Ridiculous assertions cheer leading Ver's BCH bullshit, we've all read too often. 
All the points you've brought up  over your whole diatribe of disinformation in this thread have all been debunked long before, and also in this thread, over and over.
You have nothing of worth left to say,   didn't have anything in the beginning obviously, though we  gave you the benefit of the doubt  early on.
You are directly supporting a scam, as so many Ver shills before you. There is nothing new you can say. You've pretty much been through the whole list of lies, disinformation and, when that meets hard logic, downright shit slinging nonsense.
This deep in the thread, nobody is paying attention anyway.  You're not misleading me, or anyone else here.  I and other crypto enthusiasts have seen your type come and go so often.  
So stop wasting your master's money.  Get on back to /btc, or whatever cesspool of corruption and disinformation you came from.  Your anti-Bitcoin abuse had been heard, and rejected.
Bitcoin will move on, as  always, with, our without you, Ver, Jihan, or any of the corrupt jokers working against Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:15:41


Absolutely not.
The source code is open for anyone to start their own project. With its own name and other resources (like blockchain in this case).
Shady shit like trying to hijack the resources of the parent project is shunned in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
Ver's BCH scam is not a legitimate altcoin, has no worth as a bona fide cryptocurrency. Ver and his projects lack any shred of legitimacy or integrity (not to mention BCH is technically a steaming pile of garbage but that's another topic).
The only thing BCH is good for is as (yet another) get-rich-quick scheme. 
If Ver, Jihan &amp; Co had the slightest interest, or capability, of starting a legit altcoin, with its own name and blockchain, it would be welcome! 
They do not, and cannot, so they constantly, consistently try to steal the good name, reputation and resources of Bitcoin.  Shady, shady shit.
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:40:00
Handing control of the Bitcoin project over to shady gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; co is a scam.  Yes.
There is no reason to increase block size presently.  If there is eventually, the Bticoin devs will do it, not some shady scam artists.
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:40:15
Bad actors such as Jihan, Ver &amp; the yahoos that signed Jihan's 2x scam, have zero interest in "compromise".  They want to turn Bitcoin into another centrally controlled payment system.
We already have things like banks and credit cards.  Zero need to cooperate with such shady bad actors. That would be directly to Bitcoin's detriment.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:58:35
Bitcoin is an Open Source project. If you want to change something, anyone is free to submit code to the project. If it is worthy, it will be accepted.
Nobody in their right mind is willing to turn Bitcoin over to a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control, or any of the shady corporations behind the 2x scam. 
In fact, the ONE dev they had recently jumped ship.  
These gangsters have neither the technological know how, nor any interest in improving bitcoin, as their long line of hostile takeover attempts clearly proves.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:39:36
What they said is, if the 2x attack is successful, they'll fully support it.  
This is no different than Coinbase's latest flip-flop.
Nothing to praise here, quite the opposite. :(
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:58:14


We've heard so much of this downright shit slining from supporters of every scam that's come down the line lately.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, 2x....
This person has sidestepped any semblance of intelligent conversation and gone right into what they do when confronted with facts an reason. 
The people behind such are in no way part of the Bitcoin, Crypto or Open Source communities.
Quite the opposite! They consistently and constantly attack it.  :(
This 2x crap is just like all the others before it, a hostile takeover attempt. And the methods used to promote such are just as detestable as the scams themselves. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:31:49
Nobody supporting Jihan &amp; Co's 2x scam (or any in the long line of scams before it) are part of the Bitcoin community.
They are outsiders directly attacking it.
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:16:17
True, the 2x scam will never outvalue Bitcoin. We've seen so many scams like it before.
This isn't the seed of the matter though. The problem lies in the methods used:
There is the Bitcoin open source project,
and there are shady gangsters, that have never contributed one line of code to it, trying to steal its resources and reputation they have no claim to.
Jihan's 2x scam crew have no right to call anything they create "Bitcoin", nor "SegWit", nor use Bitcoin's blockchain for their spam.
Such shady behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:47:58
Jihan and his goons have proven that they don't want Bitcoin to succeed by constantly and consistently blocking its progress for their own greed,  and launching hostile takeover attempts, 2x being the latest in a long line.
Also, they are not all miners. There are plenty of trustworthy mining outfits. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:37:19
IF Bitcoin is ever replaced as king of the hill, it sure as hell won't be by a scam like 2x, or the long line of hostile takeover attempts such yahoos have tried against Bitcoin.
Now that they have been forced to stop blocking SegWit, the door is open to all manner of exciting scaling tech.  No idea why your outlook for Bitcoin is so bleak.
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:57:25
Their coin would be completely under corrupt corporate control.  The gangsters behind the 2x scam only have a tiny handful of devs.  In fact, I red that recently the only one left that would work for them has left to do his own project, so they have NO devs.
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust anything of worth to these bad actors.  2x is just the latest in a long line of hostile takeover attempts.
Willy-nilly increasing block size only encourages even further mining power centralization, which is why Jihan &amp; his cronies are constantly pushing their "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda.
Now that they are no longer blocking SegWit, we have all kinds of exciting scaling tech to explore.  Until such safe and sane scaling methods are exhausted, there is absolutely no need to even talk about block size.
IF that day ever comes, the Bitcoin devs will do it,  not a bunch of corrupt corporations.
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:43:33

I still wish these companies would stop referring to it as a fork of Bitcoin.  
The 2x scam has no business even using the Bitcoin name. Nor SegWit for that matter.
It is not a legit fork, not even a legit altcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:40:52
2x is in no way an upgrade. 
It is a hostile takeover attempt.

There are bona fide bitcoin wallets that can split such scamcoins off. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:08:24
2x had nothing to do with activating segwit.
The threat of a UASF is why Jihan &amp; his goons finally shaped up. They were about to be shipped out.
This little 2x scam they tried to slip in?  Nobody is taking that seriously except those in on the scam.
Now we have to be careful if they actually try this attack, but other than that, the whole 2x silliness was DOA.

Fortunately such scams are easier and easier to spot, and while some newbies might be fooled for a bit, they soon realize that subs like that are mostly lies and propaganda. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:40:04
There is zero reason for the descriptor "core".
There is only the Open Source Bitcoin project. There is only one.
2x is nothing but another in a long line of hostile takeover attempts against it.
The gangsters behind this latest 2x scam have zero claim to the name Bitcoin, or SegWit, nor any of the project's other resources. 
Anyone is free to submit code to Bitcoin. If it is worthy, it is accepted. That is how Open Source works.
Jihan, Ver &amp; their gang of corrupt corporations in on the 2x scam have no interest in such, nor do they have the technological capability. Hence their constant scams and hostile takeover attempts.
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:57:06
What are you talking about exactly? Bitcoin is decentralized. It is one of the very base technologies it is built on.
Also, that BTG project is just doing more of the same, trying to steal the name and reputation of another project, one they have zero claim to.
It *might* be a worthy altcoin, technologically, but they threw any legitimacy out the window by using that name.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:22:40

@_date: 2017-10-24 16:01:32
A soft fork or hard fork done by Bitcoin has nothing to do with these yahoos trying to steal the Bitcoin name.
They have zero legitimacy whatsoever.
A legit altcoin that uses Bitcoin as a starting point, that uses its own name and blockchain is legitimate.  Such competition is healthy and welcome.
The rest of the imposters on this list are nothing of the sort. They are purely hostile takeover attempts.

Oh god, this thread got hit hard with a pro-ethereum brigade.
I wonder if that was OP's objective?  
Well, for all its (fatal) faults, it is at least a bona fide altcoin. 
Uses its own name and blockchain.  
A far cry better, in any case, than the hostile takeover attempts Jihan, Ver &amp; Co constantly push (hello 2x).
If I'm not mistaken though, ethereum has its own forum here.

BCash aka BCH was another hostile takeover attempt against Bitcoin. Happened beginning of the year or so.
It went down in flames just like all the others before it...

None of these were legit hard forks, nor even altcoins.

@_date: 2017-10-06 15:58:19
No, 2x is not an upgrade,  and no, Bitcoin is not accepting this scam any more than it did the long line of scams before it from bad actors such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
Nobody is trying to "back out"...  nobody in their right mind even considered this scam in the first place.
There is absolutely zero of merit or worth in this 2x silliness.  Nobody is going to run software written by a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control.
It's absolutely ridiculous the blatant propaganda pushing this crap.   Talk about lies!

Jihan, Ver &amp; other such bad actors are not interested in "compromise".  They want full control of Bitcoin for their own profit, and to the detriment of the project.
It does no good to negotiate with someone that is out to destroy you. Any "compromise" is completely unacceptable when talking about such disreputable gangsters.
There is absolutely zero reason to go willy-nilly increasing block size because of these scam artists.
SegWit opens the door to all sorts of scaling tech. That needs to be fully explored before talk about block size changes are even considered. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:53:05
"We're the true bitcoin. The other one is an impostor".

There are many many mining outfits that are reputable and trustworthy.
Back when g-card mining pools were more popular, and one of those pools was approaching the infamous 51% mark, you know what they did?
They spit up and encouraged their members to move to other pools to ensure decentralization.  
Shady gangsters such as those behind this 2x scam (hi Jihan &amp; Co.) want exactly the opposite, and have shown their untrustworthy, hostile nature again and again.
Not all miners are evil. The good ones have been pro-SegWit all along.
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:14:57
This 2x scam, nor the Bcash, btc1, Unlimited, Classic or XT scams before it are in any way legitimate "Forks".  They are simply hostile takeover attempts.
There is no "compromise" with bad actors trying to destroy Bitcoin. Giving them anything would be purely destructive.
If they had any shred of integrity or trustworthyness, they would create a legitimate altcoin. Its own name and blockchain. Legit competition is welcome!
Such scam artists have neither the technical capability, nor interest in such.

Bitcoin is an Open Source project. It has nothing to do with Blockstream. Stop trying to spread lies. People here know what's up.
2x is nothing more than another hostile takeover attempt from shady bad actors. They have no claim to the Bitcoin name, nor any of its other resources. This includes its blockchain.
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:46:36
even 2mb would cut off a large amount of people from running their own node.  Not everyone lives in places with abundant, relatively cheap bandwidth.
Anyway, it's irrelevant.  Nobody is willing to turn over Bitcoin development to a bunch of Gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:55:44
The Bitcoin Open Source project is the project.
Such propaganda and disinformation about "leadership" is silly.
Submit your code.  If it is worthy, it will be accepted. That is how Open Source works. That is how Bitcoin works.
If your code is not accepted (and none of the 2x yahoos have even tried mind you) then you are freely able to use the source code for your *own* project.  
The gangsters trying for yet another hostile takeover attempt (hello Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.) are neither technologically capable of producing a legit altcoin (as they have proven, again and again), *nor do they have any interest in such.*  
Bona fide competition (in this case, legit altcoin)  is fully encouraged and welcome in Open Source!
What you will be shunned for is trying to steal the resources of the parent project. This includes name, and in this case, blockchain. This is what 2x, and the scams before it are guilty of.

@_date: 2017-10-26 08:09:47
There is nothing controversial about the Bitcoin project whatsoever.
Such ridiculous propaganda and disinformation is pushed by shady outfits trying to steal the resources of another project. Pure and simple.
Claims of there being "controversy" are not only false, they are a direct attack that is seen over and over, and debunked over and over, with each new hostile takeover attempt (2x being the latest in a long line).
You are directly advocating against Open Source, and Bitcoin. Possibly out of ignorance of how Open Source actually works, but this sort of thing is all too commonly used to support hostile takeover attempts.  Stop that.
Coinbase is saying that THEY will decide what Bitcoin is. That is not their place.  They freely admit they will throw their Bitcoin holders under the bus and support an attack, so long it is successful. 


They said *the exact opposite*.  They have admitted that they will support any 51% attack on Bitcoin that is successful.  They are siding completely with the shady mining outfits and corrupt corporations staging the 2x attack.  This is going *directly against the Bitcoin community.*
This is shady, shady business.
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:06:49
There is a much simpler way.  People that support the longevity and usefulness of Bitcoin, such as its community, dev team, and trustworthy mining outfits, are part of its community.
Shady gangsters running hostile takeover attempts such as 2x, are the opposite.  It is very simple.
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:22:00
Every time bad actors attack Bitcoin, it exposes that attack vector and grows stronger.
We've seen a long line of such get-rich-quick scams:
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, now x2... none of them are worth anything except to hijack Bitcoin for their own greed.
Bitcoin still keeps chugging right along... and will continue to.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:57:30
If miners spend all their money mining the worthless 2x coin that nobody wants, they will go out of business.  Simple as that.
Bitcoin has scaling solutions fully in the works.  The people that held them back so long, blocking Segwit, are the same shady bastards behind this 2x scam.
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:04:14
What "leaders" do you propose "lead" an Open Source project, except for the dev team of that project?
The huge, internatinoal Bitcoin dev team has, and has had, full support all along,
from reputable mining concerns, from the Crypto and Open Source communities, and all but the most shady bad actors (hi jihan, ver &amp; co).
You are talking about a hostile takeover attempt, like 2x, and many before it.
Anyone is free to copy the source code for their *own* project.
What is not allowed is to try and steal the resources of the parent project like 2x is attempting.
Such shady behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:18:17
What is wrong with the 2x scam having a ticker of B2X?  
It will be a miracle if anyone trades that crap in the first place, having basically no replay protection, 
but it's a good thing they have labelled it B2X.  
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:19:52
Solidly with the Bitcoin project.
The 2x scam doesn't even have a dev team. It doesn't stand a chance.
Still, it is important to pay attention to, as such attacks need to be guarded against.
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:19:30
Coinbase said they will support the 2x scam if it is successful. 
Completely untrustworthy company.  :(
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:12:30
There isn't really a need shown yet.
We still have lots of scaling options to explore before we even think about messing with block size.
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:25:07
The leaders are the huge, international and very knowledgable dev team, like with any Open Source project. Supported by the community and trustworthy miners all along, in the case of Bitcoin.
You'd have us hand development over to a tiny handful of incompetent devs under corrupt corporate control instead?  No thanks.
Anyone can submit code to an Open Source project. If it is worthy, it is accepted. None of the scams like 2x have submitted anything to the Bitcoin project, except hostile takeover attempts.
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:06:14
The vast majority of the "Big Blocks NOW!" crowd has zero technical know-how. The people pushing that nonsense are scam artists such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. 
This 2x scam is just another in a long line of hostile takeover attempts by such shady outfits.
The Bitcoin community, trustworthy miners, exchanges, and the huge and knowledgeable Bitcoin dev team have lived through countless attacks by unscrupulous mining concerns, and worse.  (XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, Bcash, 2x... the list goes on)
Now that greedy bad actors were forced to stop blocking progress (hi Jihan) SegWit has been irrevocably activated.  Bringing with it not only a de-facto "block size" increase, 
but also opening the door to a cornocopia of further scaling technology.
Until these are fully explored, the "people" (aka huge greedy companies) pushing their "Big Blocks!" propaganda have no leg to stand on.
IF bigger blocks are deemed nessicary, AFTER other safe and sane scaling features are explored, the Bitcoin dev team will implement it.
It remains to be seen, and anyone promoting the destructive takeover attempts of Jihan, Ver &amp; Co promote, only prove themselves as commpletely anti-Bitcoin, anti-Crypto, and anti-Open Source.
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:24:53
There was never a vote for Jihan's 2x scam.
There were a bunch of gangsters that all agreed on running a scam.
They didn't even keep to the plan.  lol   It has zero to do with bona fide Bitcoin.

Their latest takeover attempt means nothing. It was DOA.
Nobody is going to trust a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control.

It is the Bitcoin project's right to hardfork if they see fit.
It is anyone's right to use the open source code for their *own* project.
Trying to steal the name and resources (blockchain) of the parent project is shady, shady business and discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:09:54
Attempting to say that 90% of people support this 2x scam is utterly absurd.
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:36:38
In no way, shape or form does the 2x scam have any claim to the name Bitcoin, or SegWit.
Trying to steal the name and other resources of another project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.  
There is no such thing as 1x, stop calling it that. There is only Bitcoin.
2x is not Bitcoin, nor will it ever be.
Learn something about Open Source before you go repeating such blatant disinformation in legit Crypto forums, that is, if you want to be taken seriously.
Failing that, go sell that snake oil somewhere else, nobody here is buying.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:56:52
None of them are bona fied forks, nor even legitimate altcoins.
There is only one Open Source Bitcoin project. Those trying to steal its name and reputation deserve all the disdain they receive.
Such despicable behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:26:42
Bitcoin,  it is an Open Source project. Do you have any clue what that means?
It means ANYONE can contribute.  None of the promoters of this 2x crap have.  Nor other scams before it such as XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, Bcash, x2...   They have zero to do with the Bitcoin project, except hostile takeover attempts on it.
If you have a better idea, you are fully encouraged to submit code to the project. If it is worthy, it is accepted by the devs, and community.  This 2x scam, nor any oth the others mentioned here, was not.  Not even submitted, not approved, not consensus by any means.  2x, like the others is another hostile takeover attempt, nothing more.
The source code is open for anyone to use for their *own* project. That includes own name and own blockchain.  AKA altcoin.  Such competition is healthy and fully welcome!
The shady hostile takeover attempts of such projects as I listed is nothing of the sort. They are not legit forks, they are not legit altcoins. They are trying to steal the name, reputation and resources of the parent project (Bitcoin).
Such destructive behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:00:57
2x  is a hostile takeover attempt, not in any way an "upgrade".  It would put Bitcoin completely under the control of corrupt corporations and disreputable mining outfits under Jihan's control.
They can't even keep any devs working for them. The one they had for 2x has jumped ship. 
Nobody in their right mind would promote investing anything of worth in this insanity, unless they were in on the scam.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:38:46
Better to go into that cesspool of disinformation with a seed of truth, than wander in completely naive. 
It would be convenient to completely squash such corrupt and destructive scams sites...
But that is not the way. People learn by themselves. The more real info they have the faster IMHO.
Calling out scams such as Ver, Jihan &amp; Co. are responsible for is just a tiny part of the content here. The vast majority is discussions on the progress and future of Bitcoin.
Now that Segwit is finally underway, there are exciting things ahead!
@_date: 2017-10-05 07:02:22
There was no deal.  A bunch of scam artists sitting around scamming each other.  Not even the bad actors that organized that farce have stuck to their non"agreement".

No idea what the hell you're talking about, but let's just be very clear about the scams we're addressing. Such as:
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, and now 2x.
Yes, we've all seen these hostile takeover attempts far too often. None have any worth.
They are nothing but direct attacks against Bitcoin, Crypto and Open Source in general.
They deserve all the disdain they receive. As do those that support them.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:40:01
No, the story is very accurate.
Well, except there is no real "debate" in this latest 2x scam.
It's very clear to anyone that's been paying attention that it's just another hostile takeover attempt.  One in a long line from such disreputable bad actors.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, Bcash, x2...  none are worthy, and anyone supporting such is directly attacking not only Bitcoin, but Crypto and Open Source itself.
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:33:48
Zero need for Bitcoin to do anything about this 2x scam.
It will fail just as the long line of other hijacking attempts by bad actors have.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, x2, BCash...  None of them are worthy, technically or ethically. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:35:58
Bitcoin with segwit is still just Bitcoin.
The other imposters area not.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:06:21
Seeking consensus?  The bitcoin project HAS consensus.
Oh...  that's not what you mean though.  What you mean is it sure would be nice if we just all rolled over and gave shady charachters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co complete control over Bitcoin.
Ain't gonna happen bub.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:20:13
In open source you can take the source code and make your own project.. fork it to do what you want with it.
What is really messed up is when assholes like Ver try to steal the name and other resources (blockchain, symols, etc) of the parent project.
Doing that crap gets you  labelled a  scam artist, and for damn good reason.
And Ver does nothing but.  He has a long history of such inexcusable scams behind him.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:21:17
Gangsters like Ver, Jihan and of course, Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:33:06
No need for this.  The people that can really use what Cryptocurrencies are good for are not concerned with the decimal places.
People wanting to buy coffee can use fiat.  People trying to protect themselves from interference and corruption, or even as an investment, use Cryptocurrencies.

Yah, I can easily brush off his contribution. 
His actions over the last years completely negate any good he might have done.  
His motives back then were most likely in his own self-interest, not that of Bitcoin, as his pattern of behavior strongly suggests.

And it was by no means all miners.  Just unscrupulous gangsters under Jihan's control. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:48:49
This is by no means a political position.
There is no "opinion" on 2x to have.  It is a hostile takeover attempt. One in a long line of such shady schemes.
That the Bitcoin project is acknowledging that is a very good thing. It might keep some people safe in case these 2x gangsters do decide to attack.
There is no reason to use the descriptor "Core".  there is only one bitcoin project.
Also, the term centralization in cryptocurrencies refers to hash power and nodes, not software.
We've heard this ridiculous propaganda and disinformation with too many other scams before this.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, 2x...
and your "arguments" have been blown over, again and again.   There is nothing good, valid, or worthy about such scams.  This 2x one included.
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:01:34
BTC is the ticker used to represent Bitcoin on exchanges.
What else would it be besides Bitcoin?
The 2x scamcoin will most likely be labelled B2x. It is not Bitcoin, even if some shady exchanges unscrupulously decided to label it BTC on their platform.
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:12:24


Your faulty use of "stagnation" is actually the hostile blocking of progress by hostile mining concerns.  Most notably those under Jihan's control.
They sopped that crap now, under the recent threat of a UASF. 
Now that SegWit is irrevocably activated, progress can continue.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:48:59
And their answer?  Turn Bitcoin over to a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control.  lol

Bitcoin doesn't have any problem.
It is chugging along, slowly, safely, just like always. 
Those that have a problem are the ones that throw in with scams such as 2x.
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:17:17
No, the "Big Blocks NOW!" crowd are constantly trying for hostile takeover schemes.  
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust their buggy code with anything of worth. 
Willy nilly increasing block size would only lead to more mining power centralization, which is what they are after.  This would be detrimental to Bitcoin.
Until the cornucopia of scaling tech that SegWit opened the door to is fully explored,
any talk of bigger blocks is completely unnecessary. In fact, very counterproductive, seeing as the promoters of the "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda aren't even involved in the Bitcoin project, just trying to hijack it.
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:43:05
How many do you know that seriously got into Crypto through some scummy Google or FB advertisement?

@_date: 2017-10-27 16:36:36
No company controls Bitcoin.  It is an Open Source project with a HUGE dev team from around the world. 
Stop spreading such blatant lies.
The gangsters behind the 2x scam only had one, count him, ONE dev working on it, and now even he has jumped ship! Far as I know, they don't even have a dev team anymore.
This is who you want everyone to trust with their money?  No thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:54:15
If they "think" the 2x scam is good for Bitcoin, they are FULLY worth avoiding like the plague.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:08:33
The gangsters behind this 2x scam have no legitimate "argument" at all.  It is one more in a long line of hostile takeover attempts.
Nobody in their right mind (that is not in on the scam themselves) would promote turning over Bitcoin development to a handful of incompetent devs under corrupt corporate control.
In fact, the one dev that was working on 2x has recently jumped ship.  The scam is DOA.
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:18:17
It is not. Anyone can contribute to the Open Source Bitcoin project.
These 2x snake oil salesmen haven't submitted one line of code to Bitcoin,
all they've done is try to steal its resources (name and blockchain).

Bitcoin needs spread no propaganda.  Take yours elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:32:48

@_date: 2017-10-27 16:30:55
Yes, it is about the shady gansters behind such hostile takeover attempts. 2x is one in a long line.
They only attract the worst kind of devs. Corrupt and incompetent. The one dev (ONE!) that was working on 2x has jumped ship. Now they don't even *have* a dev team.
Besides this, trying to steal the resources of another Open Source project is shady shady business. These yahoos (hi Jihan, Ver &amp; Co!) definitely deserve all the disdain they receive.
@_date: 2017-10-15 11:51:35
This is exactly why crypto is so valuable.  Sidestepping corruption.
No banks to stop payments, cancel credit cards or steal your wealth for their own greedy politics.
Bitcoin puts our wealth under our control, and that is one of, if not it's most valuable feature.
This is infinitely more important that being able to buy a coffee with it.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:51:52
this 2x scam is in no way a compromise.  It is a hostile takeover attempt. Nothing more.
Jihan &amp; Co have no claim to use the names Bitcoin or SegWit, nor its blockchain.
Giving these gangsters their way would be the end of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.  no 2x silliness necessary.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:17:58
Oh yes, we most definitely CAN shun any company that signed the 2x scam.  
If they were doing it "innocently" then they are too incompetent to trust with anything of value.
If they were signing the scam with full knowledge (which is by FAR more likely), then they are too corrupt to trust with anything of value.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:08:56
Except for the gangsters on the "other side" have nothing to do with Bitcoin, except consitantly trying to take it over. They have no legitimate "side".
These bad actors have never submitted one line of code, and have zero claim to the name Bitcoin, or SegWit for that matter.
Last I heard, they don't even have a dev team anymore. And anyway, who in their right mind is going to trust their money to a tiny dev team completely under corporate control?  Nobody that's not in on the scam themselves.
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:12:08
Nothing contesoous about SegWit. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:12:48


Irrelevant.   
No matter who you like or don't like, the jargon "decentralization" still refers to mining power and node distribution.
It has nothing to do with the software. Your opinion on the Bitcoin dev team, or the ones attacking Bitcoin, has nothing to do with it at all.

@_date: 2017-10-07 10:29:50
That they are even pretending that this 2x scam has any legitimacy at all shows very clearly that Coinbase is not worthy of anyone's business.

These are completely worthy of nothing but avoidance, if  not outright distain for their anti-Bitcoin, anti-Crypto and anti-Open Source actions.
Personally, it will take a LOT for me to trust any company that signed onto the 2x scam in the first place.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:16:12
Decentralization has to do with mining power and node distribution.
It has nothing to do with software.
Trying to hijack the name and other resources of a seperate Open Source project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
Coinbase is saying that if this 2x attack is successful, they're fine with going along with the scam. This is directly detrimental to their customers.
Well, except for the customers in on the scam themselves.  That their CEO signed the 2x scheme in the first place already put them on the black list. 
Now this is just confirming they are not worth trusting anything of worth to.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:09:16
Bitfinex is an online wallet. Not a good idea to let them hold your Bitcoin, that is true.

@_date: 2018-02-13 11:22:08
Not when M$ is behind it.
Though their analysts is not wrong, as scams like BCash only hurt decentralization, thinking a monopolistic tyrant like Microsoft has any interest in benefiting Crypto is ridiculous.
They absolutely hate Open Source with a burning passion.  No way will they offer anything that they don't have complete control over.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:03:41
Core blocked what? 
Has Jihan or any of these yahoos ever even attempted to submit any code to the Bticoin project?   No, no they have not.
So no, the Bitcoin devs have not blocked anything.  
Judging by the ridiculous mess that is btc1,  the code wouldn't be approved anyway, but they haven't even tried.
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:38:11
It is often advised to not invest more than you can afford to lose.

@_date: 2017-10-27 23:09:00
They can pump their takeover attempt all they want. Their funds are not unlimited.  If nobody uses their garbage, they'll have to stop eventually.
Also, with the last attack BCash, miners STILL mined Bitcoin, even if signalling for the BCash scam.
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:39:49
Being able to easily make mini-transactions with it is irrelevant.
Mass public use is irrelevant. Cryptocurrency is a way to get around oppressive interference or corrupt control. This is a hugely useful feature.  One of the most important.

Mr Z, Bitcoin is an Open Source project.  I suggest you learn the first thing about such.  
As said, the *source code* of a project is open for anyone to copy and use for their own project. That is as far as forking goes. the code.
The project itself and all its resources still belongs to the parent project. This is not a difficult thing to understand.
Example:   OpenOffice is a well known Open Source project.   LibreOffice did a hard fork off of that code source and launched *their own project*.
Their own name, not distinct and separate from the parent.  In the Crypto world, this is called an altcoin.
They have their own idetntity, not in any way trying to scam off of the original.  So it is done in Open Source.
Ver, with his long line of scam coins, is constantly trying to hijack the original.  He has no interest, nor capability of producing a legitimate fork. aka altcoin.  
BCH goes against every tenant of legitimate Open Source and Crypto, and is shunned as such for damn good reason.
There is nothing, at all "peaceful" about such fuckery, nor your diatribe of disinformation.   Your "fork" is not a legitimate altcoin, it is not even a legitimate concurrency (another topic).
BCH has no shred of integrity or legitimacy.  You trying to say that stealing the reasourses of the parent project is anything but reprehensible is like saying the moon is made of green cheese.
Either you need to learn what Open Source is, and realize that yes, such shady gangsters such as Ver, Jihan &amp; Co, ARE judged by their (absent) ethics, or you need to take your BCH propaganda back to /bch.

Shady gangsters such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, that have a long history of staging such attacks on Bitcoin.  This latest 2x scam is just one of a long line.  None have worked.
The Bitcoin devs, and Community have denied them their schemes again and again, and will this time too.
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:06:44

@_date: 2017-10-24 03:26:35
It is difficult to be so generous when you've seen brigade after brigade attacking legit crypto forums again and again.  Not just here, but all over the web.
People pushing the "Big Blocks NOW!" bullshit are typically fully promoting the latest scam such as I listed above.
There is no legitimate reason to be so gung-ho about block size, especially now that SegWit has opened the way for so much technology that MUCH better accomplishes the same goal.
Without the huge threat of even further mining centralization that those hostile takeover attempts represent.
It is good to keep informing new and curious users about the realities of how Open Source, Crypto and Bitcoin work, for sure!
It is also good to recognize bad actors promoting bullshit.  Such conversations, when met with reason and legit explanations, quicly devolve into shit-slining and shaming attempts from their side. 
Typical M.O. for paid shills on a script.   And we've seen so so much of that crap.  On this forum, very specifically from /btc.  They do hardly anything else but.  :(
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:06:21
There are no "two sides" and there is no legitimate argument.
There is the open source project called Bitcoin,
and there are shady gangsters attacking it.  The 2x scam is only one more in a long line of them.
Calling such destructive, hostile takeover attempts out is only a good thing.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:26:36
It is never a good idea to keep your coins on an exchange unless you're actively trading.
Use a wallet where you have control of them, not the exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:00:12
This is not replay protection at all.  
Then again, the pitiful joke of a dev team that wrote this nonsense can't be considered programmers either.
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:24:37
Nobody needs to. There are plenty of actually reputable exchanges that don't support hostile takeover attempts.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:51:49
Running a full node lets you confirm your own transactions. This is incredibly useful.
Also, that way you know for sure you're not accepting coins from a 2x scam node,
not to mention strengthening the legitimate Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:30:45

Promoting a tiny handful incompetent devs to take over Bitcoin development.... and you talk about vaporware?
LOL..  vaporware is just what this 2x crap is, as well as the other hostile takeover attempts before it.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, Bcash, 2x... they have nothing to do with Bitcoin, they spit in the face of Open Source, and they deserve all the disdain they receive for their destructive behavior.
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:49:22


There is, it is called difficulty adjustment, and it is built in from the ground up.
All the external manipulation is the huge downfall of fiat. Completely controlled.
Cryptocurrency is not immune to such but Bitcoin has sailed onward anyway, despite all the scams and takeover attempts that  Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have attempted.
Basically, Cryptocurrency is much, much more stable than fiat that is controlled by completely corrupt international bankers. 
Crypto and Bitcoin in specific has, and will be a target for shady outfits (hello Jihan &amp; Co.)  but each attack just makes it stronger.
Aggressive takeover attempts Bitcoin has survived:
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, and this newest 2x scam will be no different.
The biggest benefit of Cryptocurrency is being able to sidestep attempts to control it. 
The Open Source Bitcoin project has been so successful at that because of the huge, international, and incredibly knowledgeable dev team that [writes the code](  The Open Source, Crypto and Bitcoin communities that [support such a worthy project]( and reputable, trustworthy miners that value longevity  and stability over quick profit.
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:16:57
Jihan, his band of unscrupulous miners, and some corrupt corporations are staging yet another hostile takeover attempt against Bitcoin.
This 2x scam is just another in a long line of such. :/
@_date: 2017-10-01 06:47:10
Yup,  this 2x scam is DOA.  
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust anything of value to a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan &amp; Co's control.
Companies that try to support this attack will only out themselves as completely unworthy to do business with.
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:35:22
Promoting it as any kinda of serious investment is the problem.
An interesting experiment, ok.. and it is a legit altcoin, unlike the 2x scam, and those before it.
It does use its own name and blockchain, as any legit Open Source project would...
but the yahoo in OP's example is saying it's as good an investment as Bitcoin, which is absolutely absurd.
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:16:09
No, the 2x nonsense is not a legit fork, nor altcoin.
It is attempting to steal the name Bitcoin and SegWit and Bitcoin's blockchain. Resources the 2x snake oil salesmen have zero claim to.
They have not contributed anything to the Bitcoin project, except such hostile takeover attempts.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:51:17
Very good point, and the futures outlook for this 2x scam has been crashing at a phenomenal rate.  It was DOA.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:18:15
No, there will still be Bitcoin, and the 2x scam.
Coinbase is just confirming that they'll be happy to support the scam.
There is no such thing as 1x.

The actual centralized bullshit is BCH.
Back to /btc with you, troll.
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:47:22
Seriously, there is zero legit reason to use the descriptor "core". 
There is just the Bitcoin open source project. There is only one.
Also, in the context of cryptocurrency, "centralized" refers to mining power and node distribution, not software.
This yahoo just threw up some major red flags we see from Ver's propagandists trying to push his scams.
They are the only cultists.  His mini-rant / attempted disinformation there is pure projection.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:45:06
They are absolutely trying to scam people. Have you seen the mess that is btc1 code?  Written by incompetent devs under their control.
Nobody in their right mind (that is not in on the scam) would trust anything of value to that disaster.
Jihan is heavily involved, and is very well known for such destructive takeover attempts.
Referring to him and his links to the 2x scam is good for public awareness.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:47:59


This is blatant FUD.  The jargon "decentralized" refers exclusively to mining power and node distribution. It has zero to do with the code.
The only people trying to confuse this, claiming that the code can be "decentralized" are supporting one of the various hostile takeover attempts by gangsters such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, Bcash, and this latest 2x scam. None of them have anything to do with bona fide Bitcoin, except their attempts to hijack the project.  Such shady behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
We've herd this disinformation again and again, and it has been corrected again and again.  Stop spreading such anti-Bitcoin propaganda if you wish to be taken seriously.
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:48:15
Support never left Bitcoin.
Nobody is taking the 2x scam seriously.  The few paying attention will dump that crap asap. 
The only reason it's at all interesting is because it's such an underhanded scheme. No replay protection n all... it's amazing that any exchange will even touch that poison.
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:04:56
There is no "infighting".  The gangsters behind the 2x scam are no part of the Bitcoin community. 
They are directly working *against* Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:11:15


Ok, this yahoo can safely be completely ignored.
@_date: 2018-07-07 06:42:36
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:11:26
They also supported Jihan's 2x scam, as well as Ver's BCH scam.
Coinbase has zero integrity.
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:14:14
Oh, the way Bitcoin works is just fine.  
Bitcoin is doing just fine, despite all the attacks yahoos like you support.
You don't even have a legit altcoin to support.  this 2x scam is nothing of the sort.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:15:17
Bitcoin is actual cryptocurrency that actually works. Has a huge and very knowledgeable dev team and tons of infrastructure. 
this 2x scam, by a handful of incompetent devs, completely under the control of gangsters like Jihan....  lol has nothing to offer.  It is just another in a long line of get-rich-quick scams.
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:16:35
Nobody that learns the first thing about Crypto and Open Source goes there.
Some are fooled at the beginning of the learning phase, but even without being told, it only takes a modicum of knowledge to make Ver's scam site very obvious.
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:22:03
Bitcoin doesn't have any problems.  It is chugging right along, slowly, safely, as it always has.
The only ones screaming about problems are the snake oil salesmen behind such scams such as 2x.
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:14:54
In reality, nobody but people in on the scam will consider 2x to be Bitcoin.  
The yahoos behind 2x don't even have a dev team. It's ridiculous.
The only thing their hostile takeover attempt will be good for is for some people to dump it as soon as anyone is fool enough to give them anything of worth for it.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:35:23
Yes,  and none of them are going to be running code from a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's, or any of the 2x gangster's control.
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:35:47
Bitcoin devs don't need to do anything regarding 2x. 
If Jihan and his cronies want to try yet another scam, let them go ahead. Each one only weakens their position. They are proving, again and again, how completely untrustworthy they are.
Nobody that signed that 2x crap are worthy of doing business with whatsoever. Nice of them to out themselves publicly.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:09:13
Simple facts are in no way propaganda.
Calling out this latest 2x scam (one in a long line) is only a good thing.
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:37:49
there is no fork.  Jihan can release some buggy code from a handful of devs under his control...
it does NOT mean anyone will actually use the crap.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:11:06
There will be no 2x activation.
Some shady gangsters might try an attack, but the bitcoin devs, community, and trustworthy miners have condemned it from the start.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:59:25


FTFY.   Stealing the name of another open source project proves they have zero legitimacy.  These are not bona fide forks, or even altcoins. They are hostile takeover attempts, pure and simple.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:13:03
What a complete and total crock of shit.
What you're promoting is the exactly opposite of "protecting their customers".
You are condoning turning Bitcoin over to a handful of incompetent devs, completely under corporate control. 
2x is in no way an "upgrade", it is yet another in a long line of hostile takeover attempts.
Take your anti-Bitcoin, anti-Open Source propaganda elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:21:02

The vast majority of miners and nodes that deal with BCH are owned by only a tiny handful of people.  It is extremely centralized.
It has no worth as an actual cryptocurrency, just as (yet another) pump n dump scam from Ver &amp; his troop of gangsters.
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:06:48
No, you'd be correct in saying "this so-called replay protection is not actually protecting anything!"
Give it a break bud.  Nobody is buying the snake oil.  People here do know what's up.
IF that lazy crap they are so desperately trying to push as legit protection is actually "working as intended" then it just shows, even more, what a total scam btc1 and this 2x crap is.
Nobody in their right mind is going to run this crap software from a tiny dev team under Jihan's control. 
Get lost.  Go back to /btc where support for such scams is welcome.
@_date: 2017-10-01 19:51:10
Beware of governments trying to "endorse" something they can't control.

@_date: 2017-09-30 08:26:04
None of these hostile takeover attempts are legitimate altcoins. XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, x2, etc...
They do nothing but attempt to steal the resources of the parent project, not offer legitimate competition.
It is nothing but an attempt to destroy Bitcoin for quick profit. That is the actual bullshit.  
Bitcoin has survived all of them, and will those to come.

@_date: 2017-10-25 23:29:38
What a load of crap.  It's exactly the opposite.
Nobody that is interested in the longevity or usefulness of Bitcoin is "fine" with the 2x scam.
You think anyone in their right mind is going to trust anything of worth to a bunch of gangsters, and a non-existent dev team?  Not unless they're in on the scam themselves.
Give us a break.  The 2x crap will lead to people losing their money.
Go promote it on /btc, they're well known for backing such hostile takeover attempts.
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:50:22
It was nothing of the sort.  
Miners in no way have anything even comparable to the authority of a government. They are not elected. Quite the opposite, it is their job to serve the project. 
Shady gangsters such as Jihan &amp; his goons are shunned by the Bitcoin Community. They were forced to stop blocking SegWit by the threat of a UASF. People running full nodes do have considerable power.
Giving unscrupulous miners the power you would like to see them have would quickly lead to the death of Bitcoin.
Your only agenda is constantly spewing disinformation and anti-Bitcoin propaganda. You do basically nothing else. I've seen it myself.
I didn't call you a shill, but if the shoe fits... now appropriately tagged.
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:13:52
Yup.  Anyone supporting this 2x scam should be avoided like the plague.  
Completely untrustworthy and deserving all the disdain they generate.
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:34:19
The only relevance any of Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's scam have is as an example of how NOT to do things.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, x2, BCH... such hostile takeover attempts deserve all the disdain they receive, as do the bad actors behind them.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:19:43
They stopped blocking segwit because of the threat of a UASF.
This 2x scam had nothing to do with it.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:49:36
There is no such thing as "the core chain".  There is the Bitcoin Open Source project  and its blockchain.
There is only one.
There are various legitimate Open Source altcoins that forked off from the Bitcoin project. Litcoin is a good example. They have their own name, symbols, and blockchains.  
And then there is Ver's long line of hostile takeover attempts...  XT, Classic, Unlimited,  mixed up in Jinah's btc1, 2x, and now we see the latest, Bcash, aka BCH. Projects that are trying desperately to steal the parent project's resources.  
This type of shady behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open source, not Just Crypto.  
Neither Ver, nor Jihan, nor any of their goons, have even attempted to contribute to the Bitcoin project.  Not one line of code has been submitted.  They only try, constantly, consistently, to hijack Bitcoin's name and reputation.  
IF they had anything worthy to offer, they would do it.  Legitimate is fully welcome. They cannot, so their constant attempts at hostile takeover.  It would be laughable if they didn't steal peope's money withe their scams.  Ver has no shred of integrity or honesty, and his scams, such as BCH, cannot even be considered altcoins.  
BCH, has no worth as an altcoin. It spits in the face of everything Open Source is based on.
BCH has no technological merit as a cryptocurrency, its handful of devs (that work directly for Ver, mind you) have proven themselves incompetent again and again.  They couldn't even figure out how to increase block size! 
And yet we see such ridiculous attempts to apologize and explain away their shady actions again and again, with every attack they make. such as that by Mr Z above here.
 
Fortunately, such disinformation and propaganda is easier and easier to spot with every altcoin these bad actors promote. 
Bitcoin has lived thorugh many, many such takeover attempts, and it is still doing just fine. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:14:11
Has nothing to do with "tribalism". 
It has to do with shady gangsters attacking Bitcoin with hostile takeover attempts.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, now 2x...
All trying to steal the resources of another Open Source project. This kind of destructive behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:45:20

@_date: 2017-10-25 12:18:40
Yes,  the 2x scam had nothing to do with SegWit activation.
Jihan and his goons decided to shape up, under threat of being shipped out by a UASF.
The 2x crap is just another hostile takeover attempt.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:00:38

Ridiculous "argument" that, once again, shows your true agenda.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:16:43
If Coinbase supports this latest 2x scam, it is fully reasonable and only intelligent to discuss.  
If Coinbase goes rouge and supports a HIGHLY contested hard fork, written by a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan &amp; Co's control, in favor of bona fide Bitcoin....
then Coinbase have lost any shred of credibility or trustworthiness.
They can only prove their integrity by shunning such scams (x2, among others) just as reputable miners, devs and the Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Open Source communities do. 
If they do go rouge and support this 2x scam, anyone with bitcoins held in their power could lose them all.
There is no replay protection in 2x.  Coinbase has complete control of Bitcoin that their clients trust them with.
They (and their clients) can only hope they do the right thing and reject hostile takeover attempts such as 2x.
@_date: 2017-10-05 07:08:43
There was no agreement in hong kong, except for a bunch of scam artists "agreeing" with each other.
Exactly like this latest new york "agreement".  Nothing of the sort.
Not even the gangsters can stay honest among themselves. Both agreements broken within weeks.  lol
No, there is no "compormise" to be made with people that constantly attempt hostile takeovers.  Jihan, Ver &amp; all the yahoos that signed that 2x scam have zero credibility, or trustworthiness.
err.. miers can mine bitcoin, or go mine something else.
Them demanding that the dev team does things as they wish is insanity, and we'd be insane to allow that to happen.
If these shady gansters had their way, they'd make a lot of quick cash, and Bitcoin would very quickly cease to exist.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:33:54
you have got to be kidding.  /btc has historically promoted every scam from Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. that's come down the line.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, this 2x scam is no different.
The only thing you'll hear over there is more disinformation and propaganda.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:32:36
The simple facts are the opposite of propaganda.
You are spreading propaganda though, in support of yet another hostile takeover attempt. 2x is the latest in a long line that people have tried to push. 
Take that crap back to /btc where it is welcome.  
@_date: 2017-09-11 06:35:54
No, there is one open source project called Bitcoin. 
Anyone can contribute. (Jihan &amp; Co never have).
You are free to use the code for your *own* project, with its own name and blockchain (aka an altcoin).  Jihan &amp; Co. never have.
All they do is try to aggressively steal the good reputation and resources of the parent project (Bitcoin). This shady behavior is condemned with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
Shady get-rich quick scams, hostile hijacking attempts by bad actors (hi Ver, hello Jihan) are nothing but direct attacks against Bitcoin, its community, and trustworthy miners.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, x2, BCash... and other destructive scams to follow, are the opposite of honest competition. They are simply destructive attempts at a hostile takeover. They have zero legitimacy.
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:07:58

@_date: 2017-10-07 10:25:36
Coinbase are completely full of shit.
That they are treating this as anything but an unscrupulous attack shows how unworthy they are of anyone's business.
Their outright bald-faced lie, that they can somehow, magically provide safety in the face of such an unscrupulous attack, is disgusting.
The 2x scam has no replay protection. Coinbase can never guarantee the safety of people's bona fide Bitcoin in the face of such an attack.
They know this full well, they can't be that stupid.  Either they are lying, or completely incompetent.
Either way, they've shown us they are completely untrustworthy.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:41:15
This is all irrelevant. 
This 2x scam is neither worthy technologically, nor morally, nor sound business.  It spits in the face of everything Open Source stands for, and is lookiing to scam people out of their money for quick profit.
Even if someone knew 5 people that (for whatever insane reason) actually wanted 2x, it would still be just as bad.
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:14:15
No, fees are fine. 
And turning over bitcoin development to a handful of incompetent programmers under Jihan's control is not going to fix anything.
In fact, it would be the end of Bitcoin.  Absolutely insane to even try to push the idea.  This 2x scam was DOA.
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:41:32

Dude, take your anti-Bitcoin disinformation attempts back to /btc where they are welcome.
Blockstream is not, in any way, Bitcoin. 
The only bad actors here are the scam artists responsible for hostile takeover attempts like 2x, and the long line of them before it.
Your idea of "re-balance" is handing complete control of Bitcoin over to shady business men and gangsters, 
ones that can't even keep a handful of devs together! And when they get a few, incompetent ones at that.
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:13:57
It very much CAN be based on objective, observable facts.
The gangsters behind the 2x scam have a history of such attacks on Bitcoin (as well as other Cryptocurrencies). 
Also, nobody in their right mind (that is not in on the scam) will trust a tiny handful of incompetent devs, completely under corrupt corporate control.
In fact, the one dev that was working on the 2x scam recently jumped ship.  
Jihan &amp; his band of disreputable mining concerns do not have limitless funds. They cannot indefinitely pump their hostile takeover attempt with nobody using it.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:01:33
It's a fun notion in a way, but Cryptocurrencies are not meant to replace fiat. 
It is nice to pay for things with cash.
Cryptocurrency is very good for other things.
They'll be in parallel, each for its own purpose.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:45:54
this is all a moot point.  2x is in no way, shape or form an "upgrade".
If coinbase decides to throw their Bitcoin users under a bus by supporting a hostile takeover attempt, they're going to lose whatever credibility they're still holding on to.
They do not decide what Bitcoin is, and neither do miners, especially not unscrupulous gangsters like Jihan &amp; his goons.
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust anything of worth to this 2x scam and its non-existent dev team, run by corrupt corporate moguls...  not unless they're in on the scam themselves.

This 2x scam had zero to do with activating SegWit.
The threat of a UASF is what got SegWit activated.
no 2x crap needed, nor welcome.
What is written on the .org site is fully accurate.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:51:38
By spitting in the face of Open Source, Crypto, and specifically bitcoin?
Check it... the source code is free to use for your *own* project.  The resources of the parent project though, belong to it alone.
This includes name, reputation, and in this case, blockchain.
The shady, destructive behavior such scam artists (hi Jihan, Ver &amp; Co!) are guilty of is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto, and for damn good reason.
If these 2x yahoos wanted to offer legitimate competition, they would make a legitimate altcoin. Own name, own blockchain. That would be very welcome!
They have neither the tech know how, nor the interest. Hence the long line of hostile takeover attempts they push.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, Bcash, 2x... there will be more. Thankfully, they are getting easier and easier to spot.

2x and btc1 are basically the same scam. 
yup yup
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:15:19
It has no value,  and little utility.
Well, a good example of how NOT to do things.
At least it is an *honest* failure, unlike 2x and other scams.
Sad that it gets respect for that in this day and age of constant hostile takeover attempts,
but at least it uses its own name and blockchain, 
as any altcoin that is interested in the slightest modicum of respect does.
Pay attention 2x snake oil salesmen, even ethereum does it better.  
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:39:15
Decentralization does not refer to software. It refers to mining power and node distribution.
The only people that try to confuse the two are promoting hostile takeover attempts such as 2x, and a long line of others. We've seen this tactic all too often.
Please do not repeat such blatant disinformation.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:38:39


This is completely false.  There is one open source Bitcoin project.
There are other projects that are compatible and support it, but the 2x scam is not one of them.
Anyway, decentralization refers to mining power and node concentration. It has zero to do with the code at all.
You are free to use the code for your *own* project, but the resources of the parent project belong to it alone.
This includes name, and in this case blockchain.  Trying to steal the resources of another Open Source project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
This is exactly what shady bad actors such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have consistently done, including this 2x scam.
It is abusive in the extreme for them to use the name SegWit, or Bitcoin at all. They have zero claim to them, nor the Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:44:47
please don't call it 1x.  SegWit is simply Segwit.
Jihan &amp; Co's 2x scam has nothing to do with Segwit, or Bitcoin.
Well, except it's just another in a long line of hostile takeover attempts on Bitcoin.
Calling Segwit 1x lends legitimacy to the 2x scam,  that it has absolutely no claim to.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:55:50

Nothing about 2x "just works".

this is not the case.  There are a small amount of shady gangster attempting a hostile takeover.  That is what this 2x scam is.
It neither has the support of the community, Bitcoin dev team, or reputable mining outfits.  Also, trustworthy exchanges won't touch that poison.
The list of companies supporting this 2x scam is a good resource. It tells us who is completely untrustworthy and not worthy of our business.

Err hello?  Have you the first clue about what Open Source is?
Anyone is free to use the source code to start their own project.
This means though, the project having its own resources. This includes name, and in the case of crypto, its own blockchain.
AKA a legit altcoin.   This is fully encouraged. 
Shady gangsters such as Jihan, Ver and the disreputable outfits that signed up for the 2x scam have no interest in any such legitimate competition.
All they are doing is trying to take over an already established Open Source project.
This type if shady behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.  And for damn good reason.
There is one Bitcoin project. If any of these yahoos want to contribute, they can freely offer their code, as any of us can.  None of them have.  Jihan, Ver, they only attack and attempt to destroy. They've done the exact *opposite* of contribute or advance anything, except their own get-rich-quick scams.
This latest 2x crap has no worth whatsoever.  Buggy code by a tiny handful of devs under Jihan's control.
No thanks. Nobody wants that unless they're in on the scam.
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:41:04
Yes. That is it exactly. There is one Open Source crypto project named Bitcoin.  It has one code repository.  It has a production and a test blockchain.  
These things belong to it exclusively, as any Open Source project owns its own resources.  This is not rocket science. It is a mainstay of Open Source. Always has been, always will be.
Yes, you are free to take the source code and modify it to your heart's content.
You are NOT free to steal the resources of the parent project.
In the case of crypto, a legitimate altcoin needs its own name and blockchain for instance.  Such legitimate competition is healthy and very welcome.
Shady gangsters such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co do the opposite. They constantly &amp; consistently try to affiliate themselves with the Bitcoin project (among others), though they have zero claim to the name, reputation, blockchain, or anything to do with Bitcoin.  They use the name, and spam the blockchain with their destructive scams.
They are neither technologically capable of offering legit competition, nor are they interested in such.  Thier only goal is destructive, hostile takeover attempts:  XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, 2x, etc.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:54:06
The shady mining outfits under Jihan's control, that are constantly pushing scams such as 2x, don't pay for electricity. That is part of the reason they have been able to so dangerously and destructively  centralize so much mining power.
They are the ones that blocked progress.  Now that they have been forced to stop blocking SegWit, the door is open to all kinds of exciting scaling technology.
There is no reason to even talk about block size until other options have been explored.
Willy-nilly increasing block size only promotes even further mining power centralization, which is why Jihan &amp; his goons push their "Bit Blocks NOW!" propaganda so hard.
And why the Bitcoin devs, trustworthy miners, and communtiy have denied them their shady plans again, and again.
Bitcoin is doing just fine. Nobody in their right mind is going to turn Bitcoin development over to a tiny handful of incompetent devs behind 2x.  In fact, last I read, they don't even *have* a dev team anymore.
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:16:50
Oh, the "people" pushing this "Big Bocks NOW!" propaganda are not people.. Ver &amp; Co is well known for using paid shills. 
There might be a few newbies that fall into their trap (hi /btc) but the vast majority of people that frequent legit crypto forums such as this one fully know what's up.
The attacks on Bitcoin, and Crypto in general have been many, and increasingly obvious.
XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, Bcash, now 2x....  
None of them have contributed anything to the Bitcoin project except to attack it.  Fortunately, they are easier and easier to spot as the destructive corporate takeover attempts they are,
and only make Bitcoin, and Cryptocoins in general, stronger.
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:50:59
No, I'm right.  As anyone that has spent any time here knows full well.
Not even a decent try.  Take your propaganda elsewhere. 
You are not trying to help at all. Quite the opposite.
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:49:04
Enormous.  This 2x scam was DOA.
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:34:15
And here we see, yet again, what shilling for such scams looks like.
In the face of facts and logical explinations about the technology,
their conversation turns very quickly to personal attacks.  Such shit slinging is typical M.O. from brigaders from shady forums such as /btc, and their consistent brigades on legit crypto forums such as this one.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:45:58
This 2x is nothing but a hostile takeover attempt.  It is the very definition of an attack.
There can be no two "opinions" about this.  To say it is only an opinion shows you support the attack.
Don't expect any love here or any legit crypto or open source forum with such an anti-bitcoin, anti-open source attitude.
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:12:15
Hilarious.  
There is a sub dedicated to promoting ethereum.  
Go spew your undying, against-all-odds devotion there where people are interested.
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:16:11
What are you talking about?  There is an Open Source project called Bitcoin. There is only one. 
There are many many devs from all over the world that contribute to it. You can too. If your code submission is worthy, it will be accepted.
This is how Open Source works.
No, "decentralization" has zero to do with governance.  This blatant disinformation attempt is trotted out with every scam that comes down the line. And it is debunked again, and again.
You are promoting turning over Biitcoin development to a band of shady gangsters with a non-existant dev team.  Nobody in their right mind would support that. Not unless they're in  on the scam themselves.
The group responsible for this 2x scam (like many before it) have contributed nothing to the Bitcoin project, except hostile takeover attempts.  
2x is an attack, in every sense of the word. On the Bitcoin project, its community, be they users, devs or reputable miners.  If it succeeded, there would be no more Bitcoin.  
The devs would move on to another altcoin, but no way they'd work for shady gangsters like the attackers. Not if they value their reputation at all.
Now, either do some research and inform yourself on how Open Source actually operates, or go sell your snake oil elsewhere. Nobody here is buying. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:33:29
The 2x scam is a hostile takeover attempt.  Increasing block size in an effort to further centralize mining power for disreputable mining concerns and corrupt businesses.
It is absolutely trying to steal funds and steal value.
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control with anything of value.
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:59:45
Blockstream has nothing to do with it whatsoever. If you want to be taken seriously, stop with that ridiculous propaganda.
The only reason progress has been held back is because of some shady mining outfits under Jihan's control (the ones you are promoting with your disinformation attempts).
The huge, international and extremely knowledgable Bitcoin dev team, trustworthy miners, and Bticoin community all agree that willy-nilly increasing block size creates FAR more problems that it could possibly help.
Now that Jihan &amp; his goons have stopped blocking SegWit, we can explore all the exciting scaling tech it opens the door for. Until that is done, any "Big Blocks NOW!" silliness is completely absurd.
There is no reason to describe Bitcoin devs as "core".  There is only one Bitcoin project.
IF a block size adjustment is necessary, Bitcoin devs will do it. As things are now though, that would lead to more mining power centralization, which explains why Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are constantly pushing for such, and why they are denied their hostile takeover attempts (2x in this case) again, and again.
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:15:37
Disreputable miners also signalled for the BCash scam, but STILL mined Bitcoin.  Their signalling isn't worth much as a metric of success or support.

@_date: 2017-10-25 23:57:34
Well, not all miners.  There are plenty of trustworthy miners that still support Bitcoin.
The problem is shady gangsters like Jihan's outfit, an the others he has under his boot heel.
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:12:24
Learn the first thing about Open Source before you come into a legit Crypto forum repeating such disinformation.
Trying to steal the resources of another project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
This 2x scam is just one in a long line... XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, BCash, x2...
None of them have any claim to the names Bitcoin or Segwit, nor any other of Bitcoin's resources, including blockchain.
If someone is interested in improving Bitcoin, they can submit code. If it is worthy, it is accepted. That is how Open Source works.
You can also freely copy the code for your own project, with its own name and blockchain. Such healthy competition is fully welcome!
Jihan, Ver and the other shady gangsters behind this latest 2x scam have zero interest in anything like this, nor do they have the technological capacity. So, they constantly try their hostile takeover attempts.
They have earned every bit of disdain they get for it. There is no "theory" about it whatsoever. We've seen it again and again.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:45:26
A fool and their coin are soon parted.

Still completely ignoring the very core of what Open Source is about.
The resources of the Bitcoin project belong to that project. Including things like name, symbols and blockchain.
The project itself, anyone can contribute to, including you and me.
The source code is free for anyone to copy and modify for their *own* project, with its own name and other resources.
What is NOT ok is trying to steal the resources of another project, like 2x is trying to do.

Classic Coin is just another get-rich-quick scam with deep pockets to spread disinformation and hype up completely bogus "controversy" where none actually exists.
It is an aggressive takeover attempt that has zero to do with actual bitcoin, except the code base they started with.
We've had far too much of such nonsense around here and other legitimate cryptocurrency forums lately.
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:59:09
And they are right.  Devs working on the open source Bitcoin project come from all over the world.  I is a huge group. *This has nothing to do with the jargon "decentralized" that is specific to Cryptocurrency.*
They are all working on ONE project, Bitcoin.  This does not mean that there are hundreds of "Bitcoin" projects.  That is not how open source works. And again, even if, it still would have nothing to do with "decentralized" in relation to Crypto.
No one person in group is "in charge"... anyone can contribute.  If the code is good, then it is accepted. Scam artists like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have never submitted one line of code to the project. They have no interest, nor are they capable.
All they do is try to hijack the reputation, name and blockchain of another Open Source project. This is very destructive and they deserve all the disdain such despicable behavior has earned them.
This exact bit of disinformation around the term decentralized has been explained again, and again. Such propaganda pops up its ugly head with every new scam that comes down the line. This 2x being just the latest.
Please learn a bit about how Open Source works and stop repeating such blatant disinformation.  
If you insist on continuing, I suggest you do it over at /btc. They welcome and foster such shady projects and tactics.

The only reason anyone serious will touch the 2x scamcoin is to dump it as soon as any fool offers anything of worth for it.
It is dangerous in that they have not implemented replay protection, but any exchange that values their reputation will not trade it until that protection is there.
Keeping your Bitcoin safe in a wallet where you control the keys, at least until the inevetable crash and burn of 2x, is a safe bet.
As said before, running a full node connected to other bona fide Bitcoin nodes is extremely beneficial.  Personally, and for the network. You can verify your own transactions that way.

Now now,  Bitcoin is an Open Source project.  
If shady gangsters like the 2x crew ever managed to hijack it, it would simply cease to exist. Another similar project would take its place.  Better and stronger.
Until now though, the large and knowledgeable Bitcoin dev team, Crypto &amp; Open Source communities, and trustworthy mining outfits, have staved off such scams and attacks. 
They won't stop, but Bitcoin's technology and reputation are forged stronger every time it comes under fire.
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:20:10
That will, of course, be Bitcoin. 
There is nothing wrong with calling out shady bad actors for supporting this 2x scam.

"proposed" attack.  Do you know how devastating a 51% attack would be?  You speak as if it is just some fantasy.
It is the DEATH of any altcoin that encounters it (bitcoin included).
Large bitcoin mining pools have split off when they got even *near* 50% mining power because it is so serious. This is respectable behavior.  
Even if your Pollyanna, pie in the sky, trust in human nature (or whatever you're trying to assert) were true, we have no idea what you're actually trying to promote with your "reasoning", except nay-saying the threat of one group, organization, person, whatever reaching that critical 51% is detrimental to bitcoin. To any cryptocurrency.
Nobody can say this is not a serious threat and expect to be taken seriously.
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:17:26

the *resources* of that parent / sibling project are not!

@_date: 2017-10-24 04:51:32
Please learn the first thing about Open Source before repeating such nonsense in a legit Crypto forum.
The Open Source project called Bitcoin is, as any are, open to contribute to.  Submit your code and, if it is worthy, it will be accepted.  The 2x scam team has not even attempted submitting a single line of code btw.
They have zero interest, nor technological know-how, as the tiny, incompetent dev team they have has proven again, and again.
The source code is also freely available to copy for your *own* project. Including own name, and own blockchain.  Trying to steal the resources of the parent project is very, very shady business. Discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just crypto.
Legit alt coins are welcome.  Honest competition is only a good thing.
The gansters behind 2x, as with the hostile takeover attempts before it, (xt, classic, unlimited, btc1, bcash), have zero interest in anything honest.  They only are looking to steal the reputation, name and blockchain of the parent project (Bitcoin),
and are shunned because of their destructive behavior, as well as technological incompetence. 
They have nothing to do with Bitcoin, or SegWit, except for their abuses against it.
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:52:15
A lot of miners do support Bitcoin's longevity and usefulness.  
Jihan and his band of gangsters do not, they are the problem.
A good example of trustworthy miners:  Back when GPU mining was still popular, a large mining pool started to approach the dangerous 51% mark.  What did they do, take advantage and stage an attack (like Jihan is trying)?  No, they spit off into smaller groups, encouraging their clients to move to another pool so that people could still trust them.
This is an example of integrity in mining. Putting Bitcoin over short-term profits.  It is something Jihan &amp; Co. have no interest in. :(

Consideration maybe, but miner's wishes (profit) are directly opposite to what is actually healthy for bitcoin. Making them first priority cannot happen, and anyone promoting such either has no idea what they are talking about, or are trying to run a scam.

This service isn't actually going to use bitcoin. It's very misleading that they keep saying it will.
They're using a completely different scheme for micro-payments, and just mooching off the bitcoin name. :/

They don't discuss there.  They consistently promote all manner of scams, disinformation and propaganda.
It is also used as one of many launching grounds for brigades against legit crypto forums all over the web, including this one, promoting such scams. (2x included)

BCH is yet another of Ver's get rich quick scams. 
Very different.

Ver is well know for employing shills. He owns /btc sub here, as well as running the scam .com site, and scam Twitter account. 
He has contributed nothing but lies and scams to crypto. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:09:58
They are saying they will fully support the 2x scam as long as they can profit from it (to the detriment of their users).
This is in no way neutral. Quite the opposite. :(
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:22:37
Such backlogs are caused by spamming empty blocks, and blocking Bitcoin progress,  both of which your beloved 2x scam artists  are guilty of.
That has nothing to do with Bitcoin itself.
Wallstreet doesn't change their ticker symbols because someone stole the name and reputation of an existing company.  That would be ridiculous. 
That's exactly what coinbase said it would do if the 2x scam is successful.  
What they should do is completely shun the 2x attack. If nothing else, they should just leave the names the hell alone.
2x is not, and never will be Bitcoin.
You are attacking Open Source and bitcoin, by repeating disinformation and propaganda, with no real understanding of Open Source.
Unless you DO understand Open Source, in which case you're just blatantly shilling.
In either case, stop that.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:45:59
Oh come on.  BCH is absolutely a scam. On in a long line of them.
It has no dev team to speak of. The handful of devs Ver *can* get to work for him have proven themselves incompetent again and again.  They couldn't figure out how to increase block size! If they weren't stealing people's money with their lies, it'd be hilarious.
It has no worth as a cryptocurrency. None of his others before it did either, which is why Ver has built his career off hostile takeover attempts and scam sites like .com, the bogus Twitter account, etc...
IF he had any interest, or capability in offering legit competition, he wouldn't be trying to hijack another project's good name and blockchain.
He has neither, so here we are.  Lets all hope that this lawsuit goes somewhere. It would be awesome for the Bitcoin, Crypto and Open Source communities to see a cure for this cancer.
Though, even if the lawsuit goes nowhere, neither is Ver &amp; BCH.  It was doomed from the start like all the others.

Money = time.  We get it you know, no matter how much crap your lot slings in here. If you insist, I'd say you ask whoever you got your diatribe of disinformation script from, if continuing here is actually worth it. The majority here actually are aware of such tactics.  Again, you're wasting time trying to convince me, and nobody else is paying attention anymore. 
If you actually do believe the complete bullshit you're repeating, I strongly suggest you lurk more and learn how cryptocurrencies actually work before commenting again. It is VERY obvious you have no clew what you're actually saying,  or are spreading disinformation with a purpose.

No, trying to hijack the resources of a parent project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in open source.
The *source code* is open, not the name or infrastructure (in the case of cryptocurrency, this includes another project's blockchain).
Shady shit, completely abusive, and lets hope that scheme fails miserably. For the sake of open source in general, and cryptocurrency projects in specific.
Dude needs to simply use his own altcoin. Any source he wants, just using it's own damn infrastructure.  He has zero business using the bitcoin name or blockchain unless he is using bitcoin proper, which this so-called "bitcache" is not.
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:40:09

@_date: 2018-04-23 23:45:56
BCH is not a legitimate fork,  it is not an altcoin.
BCH is a hostile takeover attempt, simple as that.
If Ver had the capability or interest in offering legitimate competition, it would be respectable. He has a long history of doing exactly the opposite.
Trying to hijack the name and other resources of another project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
There is nothing respectable or worthy about BCH in the least, except as yet another get-rich-quick scam. It has no worth as a cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:35:20
They are not. 
The original whitepaper talks about sidechains. 
Just more of Ver's disinformation. :(
@_date: 2016-10-17 11:52:42
Not "yet" decided to fork, nor ever will, for very good reasons.
Very tiring constantly hearing such silliness.
Nobody is stopping you from taking the open source code and making your own altcoin. If done right, providing actual competition, and it is worthy, people will use it.
Trying to steal the resources of another project (blockchain) is shady as hell though. Don't do that. Too many other projects that could have been respectable altcoins have ruined any chances they had by taking that cheap way out.
@_date: 2016-10-26 06:28:26
That "suggestion" is rejected as nonsense.  His opinion means exactly zero.
Dude, has he or his team ever made a worthy contribution? Show me the pull requests contributing to bitcoin. I can't find any.
Blockstream's (NOT to be confused with a blockchain!) largest drive is making money off of other people's work, while producing nothing of worth themselves.
Whatever "promises" they might have made were only for themselves, and they did say this. Only other shady projects trying to falsely represent themselves as something they are not would use this example for "proof" of anything.
It is simply more disinformation, propaganda, and anti-bitcoin bullshit.
@_date: 2016-10-06 00:26:54
small harm is still harm.  What he plans has  nothing to do with bicoin.  you cannot use a standard, bona fide bitcoin wallet to exchange this so-called "bitcashe"
"Bitcache" is just another hack, piggybacking on the already established infrastructure of a competing altcoin (bitcoin). This kind of shit is shady as hell and is to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.  
If he used his own blockchain, as a serious altcoin, it would be fully acceptable.
Same goes for that lightning crap.
@_date: 2016-10-17 12:29:12

No, it piggybacks on top of the bitcoin blockchain.  The "micro-transactions" are fluff pulled out of thin air with zero actual value. We have to trust them to actually turn them into bitcoin.
Just another one of the many such schemes that asks it's customers to trust them completely with our money.
No, I'll just use bitcoin. Thanks.

BCH is in no way an altcoin. Neither is it a fork.
It is a hostile takeover attempt.  The latest in a long line from Ver, Jihan &amp; Co.
IF they wanted to offer legitimate competition, it would be very welcome!  They cannot, and have zero interest in such...
So we see this long line of abusive get-rich-quick schemes, trying to hijack an already established Open Source project.

@_date: 2016-10-06 00:30:47
so much disinformation and hype.
I like the idea of using cryptocurrency like he plans, 
but to abusively misuse the blockchain of another cryptocurrency to do it is Bad Business.
Use bitcoin properly, or use your own blockchain. Each project to their own resources.
The code is open, the established *infrastructure* (blockchain and name) of each altcoin project is not.
@_date: 2016-10-06 00:35:33
No, editing *code* is what open source is about.
Trying to hijack the *resources* of another project is shady as hell, be it another project's name, blockchain,  etc...
This type of abuse is discouraged with extreme prejudice in open source.
@_date: 2016-10-21 09:05:07
In the context  of cryptocurrency, centralization refers to mining power, nothing else.
So no, everything based on your first false "power" assertion, is false.
Also, you claiming this has to do with Open Source standards is the opposite of reality.
The code base is open and free to use / modify. A specific project's resources (be it name, reputation, or in this case blockchain) are NOT open.
The bitcoin project itself IS what some people call "core".  There is no other bona fide bitcoin project.
Altcoins are a GOOD thing. Competition is good, as long as they act responsibly and with integrity.
Attempting to abusively hijack the *resources* of a parent / sibling project is discouraged with extreme prejudice in Open Source. As it should be.
@_date: 2016-10-17 16:47:45
If anything that 1MB max block size is too large, not too small.

I have  found no technical details on what that actually is, or how it works. I'd love to read some technical details on what this MegaUpload 2 Bitcache actually entails. Got any links? Sounds like you know all about  it.
Quote from Kim from the OP article:


Undoubtedly his new MegaUpload 2 project will use blockchain based cryptocurrency for its mini-transactions, something I find a very good idea. From his statement though, "Bitcache" will not be bitcoin proper.
Until we know more details about how what they call "Bitcache" works, we can only assume he's using "bitcoin" in the loosest, most generic terms; Something the masses will more easily understand than actually accurate terms like cryptocurrency or altcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-28 00:19:42
SegWit sweeps away the whole "big block" fallacy so many other shady projects have been pushing.

The network has decided, and decides every day.
There is no question of any controversy, and all the hype of some fantasy "consensus conundrum" is nothing more than propaganda by get-rich-quick scam artists.
Nobody in their right mind is gong to be for turning over bitcoin development to a tiny handful of dissenting devs. Classic Coin &amp; Co. have shown this very clearly.
No matter how much money corporate backers pump into shilling and destructive disinformation (like so clearly seen in this thread), the fact remains that they have no product.
If they did, they'd make a respectable altcoin instead of aggressively trying to hijack the resources of another project.
They don't have something that will work though, as anyone that knows a bit about cryptocurrency can clearly see. Well, nothing that will work for anyone but the scam artists pushing such insanity.
There will be no fork to increase max block size. There have been no serious, well thought out plans to do so.
If there had been, I'd like to see the push request made to the bitcoin project for vetting. 
No, it's just a bunch of corporate backed hoopla. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 12:57:54
The reality is, much critical thought goes into bitcoin and its use.

After you hang out on /btc a while, the blatant disinformation and propaganda starts to become very apparent.  
It only takes a small amount of actual research into how Crypto, and especially Bitcoin works, to  realize how completely full of shit Ver is, and his propaganda outlets such as /btc.
The really sad thing is, when innocent crypto newbies are duped long enough to actually invest in his scamcoins.
@_date: 2016-10-20 08:59:33
The entire thing was a ruse from the beginning.
It offers no advantages, just another level of complexity, and insecurity.
If everyone started using this overnight, it would have exactly the same "problems" it claims to fix in bitcoin.

They really should just give it up.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:54:30

@_date: 2018-04-28 01:20:30

This yahoo has nothing to do with bitcoin whatsoever. Has never made a single push request to bitcoin.
He has helped to found yet another project that is aggressively trying to hijack the resources of it's mother project.
His "results" are a bunch of hot air. He has no real project, just propaganda. If he were to make an authentic alt-coin, and it was better than bitcoin, everyone would use it instead.
No, instead he's doing what so many other scam artists have tried (looking at you, Classic Coin), 
and failed miserably at.
Zero integrity, zero trust.
@_date: 2016-10-17 13:03:43

It is *exactly* what such shady outfits are. So many of them have sprung up in the last years. :(
Zero to do with actual bitcoin. Asking their customers to blindly trust them. 
All the while spamming respectable cryptocurrency forums with so much disinformation and abuse.
Anti-cryptocurrency, anti-bitcoin, anti-Open Source. Zero integrity = zero trust.
If they wanted to be taken seriously, they could use their own blockchain (and forums!), as any respectable altcoin does. 
Altcoins are a *good* thing. *Actual* competition is good for a marketplace. 
This is anything but. :(   This is simply another destructive hijacking attempt of a parent / sibling project's *resources* for personal gain.  It offers zero benefit for actual users. Only to the investors and the people running the scam.
If you send a "transaction" with this scheme, can someone receive *bona fide bitcoins with a bona fide bitcoin wallet?*  No.  It is completely incompatible, made-up fluff that has zero to do with actual bitcoin.
You have to *trust this company* to transfer their scheme's "transactions", (made up out of thin air), into something of actual worth. Namely: actual, bona fide bitcoin. I don't trust any of them, and none have anything to offer in reality except more complexity and less security.
The entire thing is ridiculous. I'll just use actual, trustworthy bitcoin, thanks.

BCH is not an altcoin. Altcoins use their own name, blockchain and other resources such as icons and images.
It is not a fork, forks do not try to hijack the resources of the parent project.
Ver, Jihan &amp; their goons have never had any interest in offering legitimate competition (that would have been welcomed), even if they were capable of it (they are not). All they do is constantly and consistently attempt hostile takeovers of another, already established Open Source project. 
This is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just Crypto.
BCH has no worth as a cryptocurrency, and the only people supporting it are in on the scam, not any part of the Bitcoin community.  They are directly attacking the bitcoin community.

This, and other legitimate bitcoin forums, have read plenty enough of such ridiculous hype. 
People do know what's *really* up. Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2016-10-28 00:32:28
Counting on people NOT performing a possible 51% attack, simply because of reputation or backlash is silly.
There are plenty of large players that would love nothing more than to completely disrupt bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general.
Also, there never was a real max block size debate. Only a few shady projects with large advertising budgets trying to stir up such hype and disinformation.
One of the nice things about SegWit is, it uses the blocks more efficiently. Sweeps aside any ridiculous ideas about willy-nilly increasing blocksize with no protections in place. :)
The people pushing for larger blocksize so hard, with no protections for further mining centralization, and the ones that would take advantage of a 51% attack that such would make so much easier, do have a LOT in common.
@_date: 2018-04-28 00:41:52
Dude, Ver runs the scam .com site, has the bogus Twitter, ownes /btc here, as well as other propaganda hubs around the web. 
He, Jihan, and their cohorts are a public threat that needs to be known. 
Awareness is a good thing. These scam artists will continue ripping people off otherwise. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 21:08:58
Electrum has nothing to do with bitcoin. 
Talk about uneducated. 
It uses an incompatible protocol, only usable by itself.
Calling it bitcoin is a cheap smoke n mirrors trick.
@_date: 2016-10-18 09:21:25
The bitcoin blockchain is a resource of the bitcoin project. 
We are not seeing bitcoin lose its position in any way, shape or form, regardless of all the disinformation and propaganda by corporate-backed shilling brigades say.
There is no legitimate controversy, and never was a question of consensus. Also, there was never a serious chance of a fork to willy-nilly increase max block size. 
Something like that needs very slow, careful consideration with strong protections in place to guard against even further mining power centralization.
Not gonna happen. Nobody even has a decent proposal, just a bunch of hot air.
Bitcoin will never take over all banks in the world. It does have its place, but people will always still use fiat too.
Bitcoin is growing, as it should, carefully, optimally safely. The devs are in it for the long haul,
as opposed to the propaganda attempts of a handful of get rich quick scam artists.
If you want honest, legitimate information about cryptocurrency and bitcoin, I strongly suggest you read here more, and that cesspool /btc less. Oh, and wait to post again until you get some basic understanding of how this stuff actually works.
@_date: 2018-04-01 04:45:06


Awesome!  Good opportunity to pick up more.
Wouldn't mind it going a little lower, but looking at the yearly line, before Ver &amp; Co started his recent scam pump n dump, we're about in line with the steady upward climb.
Ignoring that spike, 4K would be about right for the normal ups n downs on the standard trajectory.
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:12:22
No it would not.  If such a thing were to happen, Ver would have to offer his code to the Bitcoin project, and it be accepted by the masses. 
He has never offered one pull request to Bitcoin. He just constatly tries to steal the name.  That is in no way a legitimate fork, nor altcoin.
BCH has no technical worth as a cryptocurrency, and goes against everything that Open Source stands for.
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:55:15
In no way is op's calling out of a scam,
The same as Ver's scam coin BCH, or the scam .com site he runs. 
There is only one Bitcoin project. Ver has never contributed anything to it. Quite the opposite!
@_date: 2016-10-17 16:50:50
Easy, and completely insane without very carefully crafted protections against further increasing mining centralization.
If anything, the block size max at 1MB is too *large*.
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:44:11
Which has nothing to do with Ver's scam BCH. 
@_date: 2016-10-17 12:20:51
What you are promoting is nothing other than get rich quick scams. 
We've been subjected to enough of such blatant disinformation and propaganda-for-profit lately.  People know what's up, and while you might trap a few newbies, all it takes is a little learning to see the true motivation of such complete nonsense.
@_date: 2016-10-23 18:06:48

@_date: 2016-10-21 23:26:39
It is "related" to bitcoin in that they are abusively attempting to hijack the resources of an already established project.
The "transactions" they make up out of thin air, their customers have to simply trust them that it will actually be turned into something real... 
I'll just use bitcoin, or an actual altcoin, from the start. Less needless complexity, without the risk.
If they actually used their own blockchain, as respectable cryptocurrencies do. (aka altcoins, of which bitcoin is one of many), then yes, if they have advantages, offer legitimate competition, people will use it!
but that is not what they are doing, in the least. 
We can agree on one thing...  Nobody has to fall for such an illegitimate get-rich quick scam. And thankfully,very few have. Nobody that actually knows a thing or two about how cryptocurrency works.
Still, we have to deal with this constant barrage of blatant disinformation and marketing propaganda from advertising firms  trying to make a quick buck with such bullshit. :(
Bitcoin, and many other altcoins, are doing just fine regardless.
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:14:06
It would be a very very bad idea today. 
Last thing bitcoin needs is even further mining power centralization.
That is why no serious bitcoin expert or proponent is in favor of such lunacy,
and why you see it pushed by scam artists such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co so much.
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:43:53


The people still going gung-ho for a redundant raw blocksize increase are disreputable mining firms like Jihan's. 
What they "like" is irrelevant, except in that they are trying to hijack bitcoin.
There is zero reason to give such dangerous players an inch, and every reason to discourage them with extreme prejudice.
@_date: 2016-10-18 09:14:18
Rules that favor huge mining conglomerates and are extremely dangerous for normal bitcoin users?  
No, that way lies insanity.
Also, there are many large players that would love to co-opt bitcoin, twisting it into another profitable, easily controlled fiat, or downright destroying it.
 
Making that easier is no argument at all, unless you're only looking out for the interests of get rich quick scam artists and greedy bankers.
@_date: 2016-10-26 06:22:35
Oh god, THAT outfit?  Who thinks they have anything to do with bitcoin? 
They try to take advantage of the bitcoin project for personal gain, yes,
but they are not in any position, whatsoever, to make promises for a completely separate project.
Just like the other shady outfits promote with such ridiculous "arguments"... as said, hype and disinformation.
@_date: 2016-10-05 22:55:38
from your link:


They are going to use blockchian based cryptocurrency, but not actual bitcoin technology. The two are not the same thing you see. 
They are simply using the name "bitcoin" in a generic way because it is easily recognizable for the masses.
NOT saying using a blockchain based scheme for mini-transactions is a bad thing, quite the contrary. I hope it works out for them. Hell, if their setup proves worthy, I'll probably use it for this n that.
Just, as Kim said, it ain't actually bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:16:13
BCH is the latest in a long line of scams from Roger Ver.
BTC, aka the open source Bitcoin project, is a very popular crypto currency.  
Ver &amp; his paid goons attack Bitcoin once in a while with such scams like BCash. 
Bitcoin still chugs right along. :) 
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:06:47
Who told you that, Ver?  It's a lie. 
The gangster Jihan never had 90%. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:43:00
BCH is not a legit fork, altcoin, nor even a real crypto currency.

@_date: 2018-04-28 00:34:16
The community was never split.  There are no sides to pick. 
There are the Bitcoin, crypto and Open Source communities,
And there are gangsters like Ver, Jihan &amp; Co that attack them. 
@_date: 2016-10-21 08:41:57
Every shady "transaction" they conjur out of thin air actually needs to go through the bona fide bitcoin blockchain eventually, in order for it to be useful in the real world.
If everyone started using this scheme overnight, we'd see exactly the same "delays" as bitcoin does (ones such scam artists exaggerate constantly). 
Add to that, if these mystery "transactions" get delayed long enough, one party can cancel the payment, whether goods are delivered or not. 
There is no realistic way this is a good thing, at all for normal people / businesses wanting to make safe and sane transactions. As said, all it offers is another useless level of complexity and risk. 
The only people it is good for are the get-rich-quick artists pushing it.
@_date: 2016-10-21 08:51:38
They ask us to trust them completely to turn the "transactions" they pull out of thin air into actual bona fide bitcoin.
I'll just use bitcoin, thanks.

@_date: 2018-04-27 22:02:46


and doing so is incredibly scammy.  This type of behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just crypto.
Even if there are no *legal* repercussions, it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Ver and his scams are not to be trusted. 
He lacks any shred of honesty or integrity. 
There is one Open Source Bitcoin project. Zero need or reason to use "core".  
Ver has nothing to do with that project whatsoever, except his constant and consistent attacks on it.
@_date: 2016-10-17 11:57:29
This "classic coin" crap is a blight on the face of cryptocurrency.  Get rich quick scheme that never was anywhere near being widely used.
Nobody in their right mind is willing to turn bitcoin development over to a tiny handful of scam artists.
Especially ones that were promoting upping the max block size with zero protections against further centralization. Their scheme would have been a disaster. Thankfully, it was just a bunch of hot air,
and a ton of advertising money paid to shills to spread disinformation and propaganda. There simply never was any controversy, and no split in "the community" whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:35:23
You need to look into Ver's UnlimiteCoin, and the insane idea that such changes could happen weekly.
Hard fork means it strands the coins in the chain that looses "consensus".  Doing this on a weekly, even monthy, even yearly basis, is pure insanity.
This would also only encourage further mining power centralization. Something we've seen in real life now, to be dangerous enough without encouraging more of it. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:56:08

Naw,  The greedy dogs that Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are, have more bark than bite.
Status quo is just fine.  Bitcoin is chugging along *quite* nicely, despite their best efforts to hijack it. :)
We'll just wait for SegWit.  Could be it gets pushed through even without Jihan's disreputable mining pools.
The threat is real, and the scam artists would be left chasing their tails.  It's their own damn fault though.
There is zero "debate", there is only a hijacking attempt being dealt with.
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:37:42
99% of the stuff we hear about the whitepaper is disinformation from /btc &amp; Co.  Scams run by Jihan, Ver and other destructive influences, by paid shills they employ, and sadly, some crypto newbies they fool with their bullshit.

This is in stark contrast to the near-religious belief-based ideological crap that is pushed by scam artists.

Yes, and there never was any question of such "consensus" over max block size.
There will be no fork to raise it, and never was a threat of it, despite what the paid disinformation programs keep pushing.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2016-10-28 00:40:06
There are plenty of powerful players that would love nothing more than to destroy bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general. So no, assuming miners simply having more profitable things to do is no protection at all.  
The threat of a 51% attack that mining power centralization brings is very serious and must be considered in all things.
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:39:02
Remove the bigger blocks nonsense, and you have a winner.
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:02:42
Unlimited, and other scams like it (xt, classic),  cannot be done in any way. Not if bitcoin (or any crypto such scams try to hijack) is to survive.  The entire idea is completely asinine from the start, and the "implementation" is a complete joke.
The only thing to take seriously about such scams (XT, Classic, now Unlimited) is the threat they pose.
Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are to be shunned with extreme prejudice, as well as any other destructive actors that try such hijacking attempts.
Sure way to tell:  they scream about the Whitepaper somehow being sacrasant, Big Blocks NOW! being the answer, and other bullshit with no factual, logical backing. 
They want to twist bitcoin into a centralized, easily controllable payment system, which would destroy everything such an awesome cryptocurrency has going for it.
SegWit is safe and ready to go.  People spewing disinformation and propaganda about big blocks, while ignoring the de-facto *safe* increase in throughput SegWit provides, are not to be trusted.
Either they are working for scam artists like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, or have been folled by their paid propaganda campaign.  This thread is so full of /btc bullshit it's ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-04-27 22:07:30


noting could be further from the truth.
BCH has no worth as anything but a get-rich-quick scheme.  It is not worthy of being called a cryptocurrency. The entire "technology" behind it was DOA, like all of Ver's previous scams.
BCH has hardly any dev team to speak of, and those Ver *can* get to work for him are incompetents.  They could not even figure out how to increase their holy grail of blocksize!  LOL
It would be hilarious if they weren't scamming people out of their money.
@_date: 2016-10-17 13:00:25
No, it is not.  Bitcoin remains bitcoin.  
What we've seen lately are a handful of get rich quick scam artists trying to hijack it for the gain of their corporate backers.
There is no "controversy", nor was there ever a legitimate question of "consensus", contrary to the propaganda those blatant shilling brigades are pushing.
Bitcoin is doing just fine regardless.
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:09:41
This shit Ver is doing is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just crypto.

@_date: 2017-05-26 13:09:43
For some, yes.  1MB max block size is already too large.
willy-nilly increasing it will only make things worse.
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:56:11
If you remove the blocksize limit you'd quickly have scam artists such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. completely hijack bitcoin.
It would very quickly become just another controlled fiat, or credit card type centralized payment system.
This is exactly the opposite of what we need.
What we need is safe, smart scaling, such as SegWit provides.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:11:58
/btc is much more about UnlimitedCoin, or any of a long line of Ver's scams.  (hello XT, ClassicCoin, etc...)
We've seen way too many of them come and go. Fortunately, that crap is getting easier and easier to spot.
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:51:28
No, people spamming another project's blockchain for their own benefit, with HOW MANY transactions? is not in any way "threshold".
The tiny amount of information still does not excuse the abuse of transactions. It is spam, or worse. 
Even a private person doing such a thing *once in a while*, for some sort of proof of timestamp, is iffy.
A whole other project basing their existence on the resources of a *completely unaffiliated* project, is simply abuse.
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:04:59
With their own name and block chain, yes.  
Legit competition is very good. 
BCH is not anything of the sort. It has no worth as a crypto. It is not an altcoin, and not a fork. 
It is yet another failed, hostile, destructive takeover attempt. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 23:07:57
Nobody wants or planned that. We still need fiat, just not the cetralized banking that so utterly controls it. 
Cryptocurrency is an awesome *alternative* and one that can grow massively. There we can agree, but your "fiat is forever" straw man fallacy is wasted here.
Such crap is promoted only by large players that want to twist cryptocurrency, in this case bitcoin, into just another fiat. Easy to control or destroy.
People here are actually FOR the use of cryptocurrency, independent of banks and such oppressive influences. You're wasting all our time.
Going WAY off topic, so back to the *actual* subject now...
Nobody is seriously considering, nor has, handing over bitcoin development to a handful of derisive devs working for just such large corporate money. Get rich quick scam artists is what you are promoting. 
You are right on one key point... the users of cryptocurrency choose what to use.  Bitcoin is the biggest, and best. 
Nothing else has yet come close, and there are damn good reasons for that, including resisting such complete and utter bullshit like is being spewed, yet again, in threads like this.
Bye bye now.

he says, again and again, with nothing to back it up ....
except for some insane fantasy that giving the enemies of bitcoin their way will miraculously make them act right.
Increasing max block size willy-nilly is exactly the *opposite* of what bitcoin needs.
What bitcoin *actually* needs is a solution like SegWit, to more efficiently use the block size we have now, with no risk of even further mining centralization.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:33:52
Status Quo is *infinitely* better than even more mining power centralization that a raw max block size increase would bring. Shady hijacking attempts such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's must be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
SegWit first.  Then we can talk about further *safe* ways to increase scaling, without giving such dangerous scam artists even more power.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:07:56
There is no such thing as a "safe" 2MB hard fork.
That's the entire point of why nobody in their right mind wants such a thing.  It is only supported by unscrupulous miners and scam artists like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
The last thing Bitcoin needs is even further mining power centralization, 
which is what a raw max block increase would bring.
SegWit is a safe block size increase, and so much more. It is the way forward.
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:09:01

False.    We have scam artists like Roger ver and his UnlimitedCoin,  and shady mining concerns like Jihan's, trying to hijack bitcoin directly for their own profit.
There is zero "compromise" here, there is zero legitimate debate.
What we have are aggressive hijacking maneuvers working directly against the benefit of Bitcoin.
Yes, if they have their way, it would very much destroy bitcoin.
This is why nobody in their right mind wants a raw block size increase. That way lies madness.
SegWit is the safe and sane solution.  
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:20:26
You only have to look at the complete scams that that cesspool of disinformation /btc promotes.  XT, Classic, now Unlimited.  Completely incompetently written nonsense, backed by corporate investments. Not to mention all the paid shilling Ver does.
And the whole "Big Blocks NOW!" squad that has no logical foot to stand on, promoted over there for shady mining concerns like Jihan's.  
Once people start getting a bit of technical info on bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and open source in general, any doubts fade away.
It is extremely obvious sites like /btc, bitcoin.com etc... promote destructive scams.
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:43:48
It absolutely does.  This is one of the most valuable parts of Crypto.

If you even halfway pay attention to this so-called "debate" you'll quickly realize there is no debate at all.
The side screaming "Big Blocks NOW!" are working directly for the disreputable mining concerns that are currently attempting to hijack Bitccoin (hello Jihan). There is no logiclal value in a raw max block size increase. Quite the contrary, it is a ludicrous idea.
SegWit on the other hand is a safe increase of throughput, that will allow even more innovation. It is a no-brainier. This is why the *vast* majority of cryptocurrency experts &amp; bitcoin enthusiasts are completely for SegWit.
The only ones against SegWit (and for willy-nilly increasing block size) are the greedy miners under Jihan's control.
Again, there is zero legitimate "depate" here, just a bunch of lies and propaganda from places like /btc supporting Jihan &amp; Ver's hijacking attempts.

@_date: 2017-05-21 19:50:27
Only unscrupulous miners such as Jihan's, and the other pools he controls, will act against bitcoin.
There are actually miners with integrity, that fully support bitcoin for the long haul, willing to work for long-term success.  (as reputable mining concerns did when they got close to 51%, and encouraged their members to diversify).
We need to discourage the former (Jihan &amp; Co.) with extreme prejudice, 
and encourage more diversity of mining power, as the latter miners with integrity do.
I don't think we're ready for UASF yet, but if scams like BU ever actually tried to follow through with their threat (they won't), then it would be worth considering.
Unscrupulous miners can pump out as many useless BU blocks as they want. If nobody uses them, they'll crash and burn in short order.
They have no real bite behind their bark, so for now, status quo is the better solution.  Bitcoin is actually doing just fine as it is.

You mean cursing at Jihan and the unscrupulous mining outfits that are trying to hijack Bitcoin. &gt;:-(
The threat of such mining power centralization has always been there, now we are faced with the ugly reality.
Their blatant propaganda pushing to give them more monopoly control, "Big Blocks NOW!" is so very obvious.
SegWit needs to go through, or we need to sit tight.  These parasites' bark is much bigger than their bite.
Even with the destructive, underhanded efforts from the likes of Jihan, Ver, Zhang, etc... to hijack it,
Bitcoin is doing just fine.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:00:57
Storage space is not the problem.  Bandwidth is.
Increasing block size will put the little guy at an even greater disadvantage, pushing them out of the market.
It will be a huge advantage to the already too powerful mining conglomerations.  We have a dangerous situation already with Jihan &amp; Co.'s dirty hijacking maneuvers.
It could be argued that 1MB is too large as it is and really should be reduced.
@_date: 2016-05-02 08:24:03
Deny?  You mean be skeptical. 
To deny would require much better proof than we have.
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:37:04
You're actually trying to say that nobody would call SegWit practical?
Did we understand that right?  It sounds like that's what you're trying to say.
Which is, of course, completely ridiculous.  SegWit is extremely piratical.  It opens the door for all kinds of good things in the future, and solves some large problems immediately.
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:41:00
Bitcoin. Pure and simple. 
There is only one. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:31:57
Or, you could just try, logically, to make an argument for increasing block size with zero protections against the even further mining centralization that would encourage.
Again, the max block size we have now is arguably too large. We already have a big problem unscrupulous mining outfits that have MUCH too much centralization (hello Jihan, and all his underhanded schemes) and with scam artists like Roger Ver pushing destructive get-rich-quick schemes such as XT, Classic, and now Unlimited.
The ridiculous idea of simply upping max block size, with no thought as to the even further danger that would put bitcoin in, is ridiculous.  Not gonna happen.
SegWit is a de-facto increase in throughput, basically the 2mb "big blockers" are insisting on, but it does not allow unscrupulous mining concerns such as Jihan's to take advantage. Which is why they are desperately trying to block it, and spending so much money on corporate shilling (hello /btc).
Your opinion about me personally, good or bad, is neither relevant, nor interesting. Please stay on topic.
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:55:00
BU is a straight up scam, with even less integrity than it has technological merit. Namely: none.
Nobody is supporting that crap but scam artists, and the poor dupes they fool (for a time).

This isn't even a serious question.
Those that refuse to upgrade to segwit are free to use bitcoin just as anyone else does.  They just miss out on the benefits of segwit.

To state SegWit will negatively affect anyone but destructive mining pool conglomerates (hi Jihan) or scam artists (hi Ver) is either lying to others, or to yourself.

There is only one Open Source Bitcoin project. 
Ver, Jihan, &amp;Co have never been part of it.  
They've never contributed one line of code, just attacked it again and again. 
BCH has zero legitimacy, even if those gangsters could pull off a hostile takeover.

"compromising" with disreputable mining concerns, giving them their way (raw max block size increase)

Ver's previous attempted scams include:
XT, Classic, Unlimited, BCH,  and he's also heavily mixed up in Jihan's hostile takeover attempts bch1, x2... 
There is nothing of worth in any of them except get-rich-quick schemes. They steal peope's money. It is so, so obvious with the scam .com site, the bogus twitter account, and the huge propaganda campaigns legit crypto forums are plagued by when he pushes his newest takeover attempt.
None of them have any worth as legit crypto, altcoin, fork or anything of the sort.

sorry, but it is backed by the worth people invest in it, just like fiat, but not based on a government. 
Bitcoin (and legit crypto in general) is global. The less centralized (mining power and nodes), the better.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:17:17
Coinbase is absolute cancer.
They signed on with Jihan's 2x scam,  and were fully going to support Ver's BCH attack, if it had went anywhere.
Now they cut off wikileaks?   
Coinbase does not have a shred of integrity.  Avoid like the plague. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:43:54
oh god, more of this utter bullshit. Sure bud, leave it ALLL up to miners.  Don't bother with running any full nodes.  Ignore the scam artists behind the curtain. Ver was spewing this same crap a month or 2 ago. 
Current 1MB max block size is arguably already too large. The *last* thing we need is more mining power centralization. 
willy-nilly increasing block size is exactly what Jihan and his unscrupulous mining concerns want, because more centralization is exactly what it would promote.
SegWit is the way forward, not some insane idea of endlessly increasing max block size.
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:00:36
There has been zero legitimate proof of anything.
A bunch of hacked together "talking head" videos, so easy to manipulate.
Of which many have been shown to be blatantly obvious lies.  
And anything audio-only is not even worth considering.
No, there is no "proof". Not even one of the "interviews" has shown "Julian" in the same frame as his interviewer, though asserting they supposedly were in the same room.
What's crazy is believing that there is any sort of "proof" that he's alive, and even crazeir than that is that this ridiculous twitter account has anything to do with the old Wikileaks. It is blatantly obvious if you look at their MO before last October, and the bullshit we hear from this twitter account now.
None of the other people that ran Wikileaks are anywhere to be found either.   
Saying there's nothing fishy about the whole thing is just burying your head in the sand.  To each their own though. You can choose to believe the moon is made of green cheese for all I care.
Just, don't be surprised if people do ask [some uncomfortable questions about that assertion.](
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:10:25
I'm fine with Status Quo.  
If we want bitcoin to scale though, SegWit is necessary.
It has been worked on for a LONG time now, by a huge and very knowledgeable dev team.  Has been tested very well (running on litecoin as we speak in fact).
The "risk" is neglegable, the rewards great.  It's a no brainier.
To say it's a "terrible solution" is absolutely absurd. The vast majority of cryptocurrency experts are all for it.
@_date: 2017-05-14 13:42:57
Not all, just the "news" controlled by massive, monopolistic corporations. 
There are only about 6 companies in America that have a stranglehold on almost **all** television and radio.
And this huge problem is, by no means, exclusive to America. :(
The propaganda they push has very little to do with actual world events, much more with their own greedy agenda.
Actual journalistic integrity is punished today. We desperatelyl need to get money out of government.
Things like cryptocurrency can help with that, if we're careful to keep it out of such centralized control.
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:39:24
If not to??  err... presently, a raw block size increase would make bitcoin much LESS accessible and usable, because it would hand over even more control to destructive influences such as Jihan's unscrupulous mining concerns.
A block size increase, IF it was needed, would need very secure protections against such hostile hijacking attempts...
Also, the world would need a lot more bandwidth.
@_date: 2016-10-17 12:39:23

Never understood why anyone would want to fuck around with all the altcoin crap. 
Bitcoin is the strongest and best, has the best chance of catching on (and even that is a struggle).  Shittle altcoin is a waste of time and effort in my eyes.

Anyone wanna buy some Shittlecoin? ;)
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:47:43
The immediate and very real danger of willy-nilly increasing max block size FAR outweighs any redundant potential benefit.
SegWit already has a de-facto block size increase, a SAFE one.
Not one the disreputable mining conglomerates (Hi Jihan) want, that would be directly detrimental to bitcoin.


amen. Go SegWit go!  Ridiculous "Big Blocks NOW!" scam artists can take a long walk off a short dock.
@_date: 2016-10-05 01:01:17
Anyone using this scheme still needs their transactions to verify just the same, plus a ton more complexity and less security.
There is zero benefit, and so many negatives.
If they wanted to be respectable, they'd use their own blockchain, and forums, offering legitimate competition.
As it is, they are simply trying to hijack the bitcoin blockchain. Such shady behavior is bad for cryptocurrency in general and to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
There is zero benefit here, and so many negatives.
Promotion of such get-quick-rich scams have no place on any legitimate cryptocurrency forum, least of all bitcoin ones.

There has been little need. Now with unscrupulous mining conglomerates like Jihan's trying to hijack bitcion, it is imaginable.
Point is, if they ever actually went through with such an attack, full nodes could very much help clean up the spam by simply binning it.
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:59:09
My god, this thread is a huge /btc brigade.
Such total and utter crap.
No, bigger blocks will only lead to more mining power centralization. Exactly what we need to discourage! Not gonna happen.
SegWit is safe and smart scaling. This must come first. Time to get with the program.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:54:22
There never "was suppose to be a 2MB hard fork introduced along with segwit".
That never was true, and it is not true now.
The *last* thing bitcoin needs is encouraging even more mining power centralization. 
Willy-nilly increasing max block size is a ludicrous idea.
SegWit is the safe and sane solution.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:08:09
They (snake oil salemen such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.) want more mining power centralization, that SegWit does *not* allow.
Hence all the "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda.
They are working directly against bitcoin, and cryptocurrency, and open source, for their own greedy profit. 
The likes of Jihan and Ver need to take a long walk off a short dock.
Fortunately, such scams have been seen all to often before (xt, classic, now unlimited) and everyone can see how destructive Jihan's shady mining hacks are, and spot the disinformation tactics they use easier than ever.
The *last* thing bitcoin needs is willy-nilly increasing max block size. That would put even more power in Jihan's destructive influence. 
Bitcoin needs SegWit,  as safe and sane use of the blocks size we have.  This is the way forward.

This "endless hard-fork" fantasy is just that.  Ain't gonna happen, and for damn good reason.
@_date: 2017-05-18 02:22:18
That is exactly what needs to happen.
There is absolutely zero reason to "compromise" with unscrupulous miners (Jihan), or hijacking attempts / scams like Unlimited (Ver).
Upping the block size would only help them, and hurt bitcoin.
SegWit is the way forward, and if not, then status quo is fine.

It is very likely there will need be no destructive and dangerous raw max block size increase.

It has nothing to do with the Bitcoin project.

No, the unscrupulous mining concerns like Jihan &amp; Co. win.
Going down that road, those 2MB will be full, and they'll push for 4MB, then 8....  and fees be damned.  
Normal users lose bigtime, and the possibility of it completely destroying bitcoin is very, very real. 
This is not any kind of solution.
Want less fees?  Support SegWit.  It is a safe and sane solution to scaling.

Again, the max block size we have now is arguably too big.
(Netflix also offers lower-bandwidth versions for those that cannot stream 4k.

Willy-nilly upping the max block size with no protections against such, is insanity.

That question would be a good one for this Cooper joker, as well as anyone that support the blatant scam that is the "Federal" Reserve.
Even the name is completely dishonest. It has nothing at all to do with our federal government. "The Fed" is a private conglomerate of global bankers.
Laughably dishonest quote from federalreserve.gov:


Which is such a huge, steaming, pile of bullshit.  The international bankers running the "Federal" Reserve OWN those congressmen.  These globalist banking concerns have repeatedly sunk America (among others) into a recession, purely at their digression and will.

No, it's an attempted kidnapping. Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. never had custody of Bitcoin,

Willy-nilly increasing max block size, the only people that "win" are unscrupulous mining concerns like Jihan's, that already are far too centralized. 
This is an absurd idea, especially when SegWit is all ready to go.
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:56:24
And if we go willy-nilly increasing max block size, and the mining power centralization that would encourage,
*nobody* will be using bitcoin in very short order.
SegWit is already a *safe* increase, and allows side channels, which makes your "point" completely mute.
@_date: 2017-05-18 02:25:04
The unscruplulous mining outfits like Jihan is running do the exact opposite of "securing" the network.
He has lost all claim or right to an opinion at this point. He is, in fact, an enemy of bitcoin.
Miners that have integrity are being listened to, and they are signalling SegWit.
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:52:24
No, this is no compromise. 
What we need is to examine the results of SegWit, and other safe scaling methods first. 
Maybe somewhere down the road a block size increase might be useful, but it is WAY too soon to go there. 
Jihan's 2x scam is just another hijacking attempt. They have been denied him and his goons again and again, for damn good reason. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:55:46
I just explained it, in no uncertain terms. Either make a reputable counter argument (there is none) or stop wasting our time here.
Read the italics in my last comment, repeated from the one above that.
Ladies and gentlemen, this refusal to engage in honest discourse is a typical tactic that (often paid) supporters of Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are so well known for.
Blatant lies and dishonesty.  this is not the first time this anti-bitcoin yahoo has tried this maneuver either.
Possibly it is someone else on the account now, as so often happens with brigades from /btc, or offsite propaganda mills.
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:02:53
Bitcoin has a much stronger community.  It is overwhelmingly clear the direction bitcoin is going. SegWit would have been activated long ago if it wasn't for the attack shady actors such as Jihan have staged. They are no part of any cryptocurrency community, except for their own den of thieves. 
Ethereum is not suffering from such an attack, that is the difference. It has zero to do with community.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:12:38
The lies that /btc spews on the daily might fool some cryptocurrency newbies at first, but it doesn't last long. 
As people learn even a tiny bit about the tech behind Crypto and bitcoin in specific, it becomes extremely obvious what a steaming pile of crap that lot are pushing.
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:49:28
Only people with the available bandwidth can run a full node. The platform is completely irrelevant.
With the 1MB max block size we now have, we've seen entirely too much mining power centralization. Increasing it with no protections against even further centralization would be insane.
We need to promote more mining by many smaller players, as well as more full nodes. 
Which is why crypto experts are for segwit, and against indiscriminate block size increase.
@_date: 2016-10-18 22:23:46
I am very much arguing AGAINST centralization of mining power.
We can agree that catering to mining (and other) profits is NOT the sane thing to do.
Well distributed mining power is key. The threat of a 51% attack is to be taken very seriously. In fact, large mining pools have split members off to avoid the possibility. THAT is responsible behavior.
There are also many large players who would love to see bitcoin twisted into just another fiat, easily controllable, for their own profit.. Or to completely destroy it. All attempts at such must be carefully considered and that possibility nipped in the bud, EVEN if that means slower growth.  Slowly, carefully, and with beauty.  
Donno about only "8 or 10 guys" but there are obviously very major players pushing for the very thing that would directly cause even more centralization of mining power: Increasing max block size with *no* protections against even further mining power centralization.  That would be insane, as you have pointed out very well.
We basically agree with everything you're saying in this last message, but...


Goes completely against such sane and careful management.  *Such utter nonsense completely contradicts your last message.*  By your use of "core" here, you mean bitcoin itself.  
If miners choose to run any altcoin (bitcoin included), asking what that altcoin can do to better earn their support, only goes so far.  Calling it "forcing" them to use one or the other is utterly, laughably, contrary to the realities of supply and demand.
Nobody is "forcing" miners to use bitcoin, or any other altcoin!  If someone makes a better altcoin and people *use it*, miners will follow. That is the only healthy, natural progression.
**If miners choose to run a certain altcoin, without asking why and what they can do to earn support the of cryptocurrency users,**  ...lol  they deserve what they get.  Nobody will use a coin that caters to miners. That's absolutely ridiculous. Miners cannot force this either, as we've seen over and over.
Also, this has ZERO to do with Open Source software, except that most cryptocurrencies are open source (and for damn good reason).
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:25:40
There is no rift in the community.
The bitcoin community, and general cryptocurrency community, and even open source community,
is dealing with a hostile hijacking attempt staged by shady players such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
There is no "debate" or "split",  that is just more destructive propaganda.
Bitcoin is doing just fine, and will, even in the face of such attacks.
There is zero reason to negotiate or "compromise" with greedy snake oil salesmen and their paid propaganda, disinformation and shit-slinging campaigns.  
Including a ridiculously dangerous raw max block size increase, that would be playing right into their hands.
Not gonna happen.  SegWit or status quo. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:10:08
No, because that's exactly what Jihan and Ver are.
Scam artists.  Actually, much worse. 
Anyone working for them, or that has been duped by them, isn't worth worrying about much. 
Actual innocent newbies that they've fooled won't stay fooled for long. Trying to honey coat the scam artist's destructive behavior does misguided people no good at all.
The technical arguments against Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's hijacking attempts are very clear and have been gone over again, and again, as well as the lies, propaganda and downright shit-slinging that they pay for.

If that is true, sounds like we just need reputable, bona fide bitcoin clients and nodes to be SegWit ready. I mean the ones promoted on bitcoin.org. I thought this was already the case.
The "original chain" is bitcoin, aka "core". It will be moving to SegWit (with UASF, or eventually without, regardless)
The only ones supporting a non-SegWit chain would be disreputable mining outfits like Jihan's, or scams like Ver's BU.

Thankfully, many do still have the experience you describe, but it is under constant attack.

This is just another attempted hijacking by Jihan &amp; Co.
NO way, no how.  SegWit first, then we see how we can further scaling as needed, *safely*.
A raw increase in max block size ain't gonna happen. 
Jihan and the already-too centralized mining conglomerates he controls need to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:54:44
Back when there were on-chain block increases, we didn't have a very dangerous mining conglomerate directly working against the benefit of bitcoin for their own profit.
Quite the opposite.  
Even today the majority of miners are fully for the benefit of bitcoin, and display their integrity by supporting the safe and sane SegWit as the way forward.
Only scam artists like Jihan and the mining outfits he controls (with a lot of very shady practices) are for willy-nilly increasing max block size.
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:32:53
my god, /btc is having a field day in here.
Always the last resort when all else fails, downright shit-slinging.
Ver and Jihan, their scams and shady business, are bad for bitcoin.  We've all seen this so many times before.
Sell your snake oil elsewhere, the lot of you.
Willy-nilly increasing max block size just to profit shady corporate concerns is a Bad Thing.
SegWit, and *safe*, efficient scaling is the only way forward. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:53:39

This 2x scam is hardly worth mentioning. Nobody in their right mind is going to use code by a handful of devs under Jihan's control.
The community in no way wants anything like that, only Jihan and his goons.
The Bitcoin dev team has had SegWit all ready to roll for months now, and lots more good stuff to come once that happens. This is what the community wants. no 2x bullshit needed.
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:50:46
The bitcoin community has tons of respect for legitimate, trustworthy miners. The ones that have been signalling SegWit all along, or quietly waiting at worst.
OP's vid is poking fun at the unscrupulous mining concerns run by Jihan and his goons. They have fully earned every bit of disdain they get, and a silly meme is nothing compared to the aggressive hijacking maneuvers they have constantly attempted. (the latest being btc1 and the 2x scam)
Do not try to compare the two. They are distinctly separate.

The vast majority of large exchanges have made it known, in no underlain terms, that such contentious hard forks will be given all the legitimacy they deserve:  none.

There is zero reason to accept (grudgingly or not) something that is bad for bitcoin.


This is completely false. You are arguing to open bitcoin to enormous risk of even further attack.
Simply increasing max block size alone would in no way be beneficial to bitcoin, only to said scam artists.
The likes of Jihan &amp; Ver, that push such "Big Blocks NOW!" lunacy, can take a long walk off a short dock.
Activating SegWit *will* be beneficial to bitcoin and everyone using it (except the mentioned bad actors).
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:32:45
Oh bullshit.  This Jihan's latest 2x scam is fully just another hijacking attempt.  
Please do not conflate 2x with SegWit.  Jihan has no right to use that name in his dirty schemes. Those supporting his destructive hijacking attempts only prove themselves completely untrustworthy.
He can go right ahead and signal SegWit, as he should have LONG ago,
but this 2x scam was DOA. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 11:17:16
Nobody in their right mind is going to use code by a handful of devs under Jihan's control.  
This latest 2x scam was DOA, just like all their other "Big Blocks NOW!" power grabs.
They have been denied all along, for damn good reason. The LAST thing Bitcoin needs is for bad actors such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co to gain even MORE control for their abusive schemes.
SegWit will activate, and THEN we can look at *safe* scaling measures, without the insane danger in Jihan's 2x hard fork.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:04:38
It's not about trademark, it is about trustworthiness, merit and integrity.  None of which Jihan, Ver and Co have.
you just don't do shady shit like this, stealing another project's resources like that make you a slimeball.
There are damn good reasons why these snake oil salesmen are held in such low regard.
@_date: 2017-07-05 13:33:34
Which is such a crock of shit.  
I wonder who paid for this ridiculous hit piece against cryptocurrency.
There never has been any "debate", just some snake oil salesmen trying to hijack Bitcion (hello Jihan, Ver &amp; Co).
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:13:38
Oh god,  why doesn't Jihan and his goons make their own damn altcoin, if legitimate competition is what they want.
no, btc1 was DOA.  There's zero reason to even look at it.


No, there are some disreputable mining outfits under Jihan's control attacking Bitcoin, and there is a slew of propaganda and disinformation being spammed here and other legitimate crypto forums.
Like you are doing.


Nothing could be farther from the truth. You are asserting the exact opposite of the actual situation.
Take this blatant anti-bitcoin propaganda and disinformation back to /btc where you got it from. It does not belong on any legitimate bitcoin forum, nor do people spamming it.

There is nothing fanatic about simple, logical facts.
Nobody is loosing their cool, just explaining why a raw block size increase is a ludicrous idea.
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:41:18
Storage is one issue, but even more serious is the larger bandwidth requirement bigger block size brings with it.
This upped bandwidth requirement would encourage even more mining power centralization.
That is a very large reason why willy-nilly increasing max block size is so dangerous.
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:50:46
Sorry, but the max block size we have now is arguabley already too large.
There is zero good that will come with willy-nilly increasing max block size,
especially when SegWit, and it's piratical, *safe* increase is all ready to go.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:17:03
There is nothing safe about a raw max block size increase.
That will just encourage even further mining power centralization. Something we have far too much of as it is.
The only people that are really for that over SegWit are such unscrupulous mining outfits such as Jihan's that are trying to hijack bitcoin.
And possibly a few newbies that they have fooled with their disinformation campaign. 
No, there is nothing "safe" about their scheme to bypass SegWit and go right to bigger blocks.
If we are to have scalability, it must come with protections against such shady attacks.  
Segwit provides these protections.
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:26:33
There is no such thing as "segwit"2x,
The 2x is just Jihan's latest scam.  Let them try to hard fork. It will be the end of them, which is why they haven't until now.
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:17:42
Oh this guy again. 
Pushing patiently for the last four years, for something that will only increase the already dangerous mining power centralization they have achieved.  Yes, this is what unscrupulous miners such as Jihan do.
The bitcoin devs have a much better solution than turning over even *more* power to such scam artists. 
After SegWit is activated, then we can talk about further solutions, if needed.
Until then, things are fine the way they are.  
If you don't like the status quo, talk to Jihan &amp; Co, tell them to stop being abusive to bitcoin, and activate SegWit.
Giving into such leeches is absolutely the opposite of an intelligent way forward.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:14:38
Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. are not attempting to create any type of legitimate altcoin,
else they'd not insist on hijacking the resources of an already established project (Bitcoin).
True competition is very much encouraged.  Hostile takeover attempts are discouraged, with extreme prejudice, in all of Open Source, for damn good reason.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:12:27
There is absolutely zero reason to "compromise" with destructive forces trying to hijack bitcoin.
They are to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.  Disreputable mining concerns and scam artists such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. cannot and will not be given an inch.
To "compromise" with these yahoos would be like paying a kidnapper's ransom, knowing full well they'll kill your loved one anyway. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:26:14

Trading fiat for bitcoin is not the issue. The "colored" part is. 
Part of the advantage of actual items of worth is that they are not necessarily traceable. Each individual is responsible for them ourselves, which has risks, but also allows for ultimate control.
The "colored" scheme puts that control in the hands of some external company, taking away one of the most awesome things about cryptocurrency.
Personally, I think altcoins are a waste of time. Bitcoin is the strongest, most wide-spread, most well-accepted. Altcoins just water it down. They are a good "get rich quick" scheme, as I think you're pointing out. Maybe one or the other might replace bitcoin one day, but I haven't seen any signs of that yet.
Still, cryptocurrencies have something in common, the risk, and the advantages, are under the control of each individual., not dependent on some outside organization. That is their major strength. I want to keep it that way.
The whole "colored" scheme is a way to water that down and destroy the best thing about bitcoin. 
There already are solutions. If you need a transaction to be traceable, or some company demands it, there are ways already in place. "colored" is neither needed, nor useful. In fact it could be quite dangerous if it became standard.
May as well just stay with fiat then. I am not boycotting fiat, it still has its uses. I am boycotting the "colored coin" scheme. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 02:37:28

@_date: 2017-05-24 00:16:36
Asking here is asking actual cryptocurrency supporters. 
Asking /btc is like asking a hijacker their opinion on hijacking.
The vast majority of that sub is nothing but paid astroturfing from Ver &amp; Co.  It is a cesspool of propaganda and disinformation.
Safe and sane scaling has been planned for for a LONG time now.  Don't pretend SegWit is a sudden reaction. It is nothing of the sort.
Such blatant lies and shit-slinging belongs on /btc, not here. We're all rather sick of that crap.
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:15:49
The 148ers are useful.  There is more than one way to skin a snake, and Jihan better be paying attention.

LOL   What exchange that isn't in on the scam is going to trust people's money to handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control?  Who is going to trust such an exchange?  
Good luck finding someone.  If you do, take advantage immediately, it won't last long!  (if at all)
We've seen the likes of such hostile takeover attempts ALL too often...

SegWit is not blocking anything.
Indiscriminately increasing max block size is simply a stupid idea, as it would promote even further mining power centralization.
SegWit is safe, and accomplishes the same thing, making a raw block size increase a complete non-topic.
Shady mining conglomerates (hello Jihan) are blocking bitcoin's progress with their unscrupulous hijacking attempts, that is true.
@_date: 2017-05-12 13:30:04
No matter how small the transactions are, they are still spam.
Again, maybe a cool project, but they have no right to abuse another project for their own benefit. :(
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:26:36
Doubling max block size, with no protection in place for the even further mining power centralization that would cause, would be absolute insanity. 
Such a power grab has been denied Jihan and his disreputable mining concerns again, and again. 
SegWit is a safe and sane, more efficient use of the block size we have.  After it activates, then we can talk about further *safe* scaling methods.
Willy nilly increasing max block size (2x scam) is not one of them.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:23:20
They would wind up completely destroying bitcoin by that point.
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust their money to a crypto that is fully under control by gangsters like Jihan &amp; Co.
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:38:06


No, you are not. You are talking about willy-nilly increasing max block size purely for the benefit of unscrupulous miners, that want to even further concentrate and monopolize mining power.
Not gonna happen.  We have a MUCH better solution. SegWit.
That is what the vast majority of actual bitcoin enthusiasts want. 
After that goes through, *then* we can talk about further solutions (if needed), 
as long as they *also* protect bitcoin against centralization.
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:09:22
Abusing the bitcoin blockchain like they're doing is in no way brilliant.
They might have a nice project, but hijacking another project's resources like this is in no way excusable.
They are pushing out transfers by the minute with zero purpose or use to bitcoin, only cluttering up the blockchain for their own selfish purpose.
Brilliant would be if they used another way to verify a timestamp. 
The only way this is, at all, relevant to bitcoin, is to point out the abuse of bitcoin this outfit is guilty of.
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:28:38
Give us a break.  The agressive hijacking attempts of another Open Source project are directly aimed at harming that project.
Jihan's scams 2x, btc1 are in no way legitimate.
If he wanted to offer legitimate competition, he'd make his own alt-coin.  If it was worthy, people would use it.
He can't, so he is constantly attacking Bitcion. This destructive behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open source, not just crypto and bitcoin.
The *source* is free to copy and use. Another project's resources are not. Things like name, and in this case blockchain, belong to the original mother project.
Jihan &amp; Co. have no legitimate "fork".  Just more aggressive takeover attempts. They have no "side", just hijacking maneuvers.
Let them try, but it just shows even more how completely hostile and untrustworthy he and his goons are.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:17:51

Jihan and his goons can just go ahead and signal SegWit, as they should have LONG ago.
But for them to think that anyone is going to hand them a raw max block size increase though, just because of this 2x scam of theirs, is pure fantasy.
They've been denied such a power grab again and again, for damn good reason.
After SegWit activates, let them try their ridiculous idea of a 2x HF.  It would be their end, which is why they've never made good on their previous threats.
After SegWit is active, and solutions like Lightning &amp; Co are in full effect, THEN we can talk about other *SAFE* scaling solutions. None of them will come from destructive highwaymen such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:10:15

There is nothing to like about them, they have proven to be against all that is good about Bitcoin, Cryptocurrencies and Open Source, again and again.
They, and those that support their hostile takeover attempts are to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.

The threat of that UASF is the motivation for Jihan &amp; Co to finally shape up and signal SegWit.

heh,  "overwhelming majority" is way overstating things.
And those that do want scaleability, will get it with SegWit. Could be no further solutions are needed.
Increasing max block size BEFORE that is idiotic, and nobody wants that except the scam artists that would profit from even further mining power centralization.  (or newbies they have fooled with their disinformation)
There is zero reason to go *completely* the wrong direction with some fantasy of "but we can turn it around later".  No, by then the damage would have been done.  Not gonna happen bub. Sell that snake oil elsewhere.
We cannot afford to drop any nodes, just to have them doubled by greedy, already-too-centralized mining concerns that are pushing this ludicrous idea of "Bigger Blocks NOW!"

@_date: 2017-07-13 19:35:28

I'd MUCH rather trade bitcoin for gold, silver, anything REAL. I say no to putting any sort of lockdown on it. There is enough traceability for anyone as it is, without the disadvantages of the "color" scheme. "Safe" my ass.

BTC1 ??  you have got to be joking?  Why the hell would anyone want that?

"we" compromised.    So you admit to working for Jihan &amp; Co.
Very fitting, judging by your constant spamming of anti-bitcoin propaganda &amp; disinformation.
Willy-nilly increasing max block size would only give unscrupulous miners like Jihan &amp; Co even more mining power centralization. It wold push smaller mining outfits with less bandwidth even further off the map.
Trying to claim otherwise is the true mental pretzel twisting, and this is well known on legitimate cryptocurrency forums. No amount of pro-hijacking spam from Jihan &amp; Co will change that.
SegWit, and the other SAFE scaling strategies it enables, is the way forward. After they are fully explored, ways might be found to *safely* tweak block weight (there will be no more max block size with SegWit).
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:35:12
The large and knowledgeable Bitcoin dev team has it covered. This is why the majority of trustworthy miners, and Bitcoin community have been behind SegWit all along. Not to mention the clear message that the largest exchanges sent bad actors such as Ver, Jihan &amp; Co not long ago: contentious hard forks will be treated as illegitimate.
This "Bit Blocks NOW!" propaganda is nothing more than further aggressive hijacking attempts: such as btc1, 2x, ABC, BCC, XT, Classic, Unlimited, etc... from Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.  
Let Jihan go ahead and signal SegWit, as he should have LONG ago,
but Jihan &amp; Co.'s destructive schemes have been denied them again, and again, for damn good reason.
SegWit is the way forward.  IF a block size increase can safely be done, the Bitcion devs will do it.  
First though, Segwit, and SAFE scaling strategies must be explored.  Until then, there is no reason to even talk about block size.
And again, especially not with buggy code written by a handful of incompetent "devs" under Jihan's control.  lol
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:58:28
There is no "infighting".  Bitcoin is under attack from unscrupulous mining concerns (Jihan) and scams such as Unlimited (Ver).
They are in no way part of the actual bitcoin community. The only reason anyone pays attention to them is that they are directly blocking bitcoin's progress with their destructive behavior.
So, again, there is no infighting, no debate at all. Just a bunch of paid propaganda, disinformation and shit-slinging from the likes of Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.  If it wasn't for bad actors like this, SegWit would already be in full effect. 
@_date: 2016-05-12 12:19:54

There is a HUGE dev team working on Bitcion, and anyone can make a pull request (submitting code) that the dev team deams worthy, or not.
See, these shady bad actors (like Jihan) are not interested in the safety, longevity or usefulness of Bitcoin, only in their hostile takeover attempts, to hijack Bitcion for their own greed.
This has been going on for years. This sub, as well as other legitimate cryptocurrency forums around the internet have been pretty much constantly attacked by propaganda and disinformation from the shady supporters of these hijacking attempts.
It is well known that they even pay for shilling / brigading campaigns against Bitcoin, as well as other coins.

No, Mr Bomb there simply has nothing to say against factual reality.
To clarify our dire situation, for those that are confused by ridiculous assertions that the "Federal" reserve is in anyway good:
First, the name "Federal" Reserve is as dishonest as the scheme it is built on. It is owned by a conglomerate of *global* bankers, and has NOTHING to do with our federal government at all.  Any oversight congress might have is completely toothless, as has been proven again and again.  "Too Big to Fail", let alone too big to prosecute. :(
The scam "The Fed" is built on is exponential growth, something completely, undeniably unattainable in a closed system (such as a planet).
The American government prints money from *global, international banking conglomerates* (laughably called "federal" reserve), on loan with interest. Then are required by this corrupt "agreement" to pay back *that* interest with *more loans with interest*. 
Yes, let that Catch-22 situation sink in.  It is exactly as insane as it sounds. This is a completely corrupt monetary "system", as Wilson realized after he doomed America to "The Fed's" abuse.
America is not the only nation under the greedy heel of these international oligarchs.  They are a cancer on the face of the planet, and we desperately need a cure.
It is not only I that assert this, but much, much smarter people than you or me.

We have about 500 years (some would say much less) to find a cure, or doom the vast majority of the human population to slavery.

Of course, Jihan is still making ransom demands with this latest 2x scam, but that's of little concern once SegWit is active.

There is and never has been a serious debate.
Bitcoin is dealing with the blocksize, no outside solutions needed, or wanted.
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:08:35
If they would actually do that, create a legitimate alt-coin, that would be fully encouraged.
Aggressive hijacking attempts of another project's resources (such as Jihan's scams are) is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:13:31
If you are talking about SegWit,  all modern wallets, as well as mining outfits that actually support Bitcoin, have just been waiting for it to activate.  The infrastructure is there
We just need to sweep aside greedy, unscrupulous bad actors. such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.  UASF has show Jihan and his goons what they are up against. 
By all means the better option is for such shady mining concerns to ship up signal SegWit as they should have *long ago,
but if not, they will be shipped out.
If you are talking about Jihan's insane 2x Hard Fork power-grab... no chance of that happening. Once SegWit is activated, and he's denied the raw max block size increase he's been pushing for, and denied again and again,  Jihan will complain and we'll have another wave of disinformation and propaganda from the likes of /btc.
It will not matter.  Bitcoin will just chug right along, even better than before.
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:37:44
You know that's just what he would do too.  Start crying that his ridiculous 2x scam didn't go through, even though he "agreed" with himself that it should.
No bother. Once SegWit activates, we can all forget this latest hijacking attempt that is 2x. 
He'll try again of course, and be denied again, and again, as he has been all along.
@_date: 2017-07-20 10:04:52
This is much closer to the truth, except...
the ones trying to block SegWit (blocksize hardfork) are disreputable miners like Jihan &amp; Co. and are being offered the window exit if they don't shape up, as it should be.
SegWit or status quo.
@_date: 2016-05-12 13:19:50
There a lot of serious hype and propaganda, that's all.
A threat, yes, but not a serious one. 
Nobody is, or was, seriously considering turning over development to a tiny handful of dissenting devs. 
The more attention they get, the worse.
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:37:57
No matter,  the threat did its job.
The snake oil salsemen Jihan &amp; his goons are signalling SegWit now.
Their 2x power grab is a complete joke and will never happen, 
but at least they got scared enough to *finally* stop blocking SegWit. This was inevitable, but could have taken *much* longer without the threat of them shaping up, or being shipped out by a UASF.
Well done.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:06:24
Jihan and his goons are in no way part of the Bitcoin community. They are directly working *against* it.
This latest 2x scam is one example of a long line of shady behavior.
It's sad to see anyone helping them at all.  Misguided at best.
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:57:17
Absolutely.  In the past, mining pools have acted responsibly, for the benefit of bitcoin. Showing their integrity.


The pools that got anywhere near that very dangerous 51% actually *encouraged* their users to diversify.  
That is responsible and fully proper mining pool behavior.
Now we see the exact *opposite* from Jhan and all the pools he controls (not to mention the other shady shenanigans going on with his mining hardware, that he uses to control them, and supporting scams such as BU).
We desperately need to encourage more diversity in mining power, and the miners that actually support bitcoin.
We need to discourage unscrupulous mining conglomerates like Jihan's, with extreme prejudice. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:33:09
The 2x scam has nothing to do with SegWit.
SegWit will activate, one way or another,
but Jihan &amp; Co's latest power grab, this 2x fantacy, doesn't stand a chance.
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:13:17
The flaw is BCH, and other such attacks from corrupt gangsters like Ver. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:56:08
lol   Back to /btc with you now, the lot of ya.
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:22:04
It's what a group of unscrupulous miners said. Ones that have just enough hash rate to block the progress of Bitcoin.
Jihan and his goons are a small, but dangerous, portion of Bitcoin's total mining power.
@_date: 2017-07-12 12:01:02
Irrelevant, what is important is that the bandwidth will vary wildly depending on country and many various conditions.
Ultimately, we need bitcoin to be available to as many as possible, and we also want to discourage even further centralization of mining power and full nodes.
It can be argued that the current max block size is already too large.
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:11:52
Great news, but don't get too excited yet.  SegWit is not locked in until it is, 
and Jihan &amp; Co are known for, to put it kindly, unscrupulous shenanigans.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:17:23
People that obviously have no understanding of open source, cryptocurrency, or Bitcoin, 
and still aggressively support shady players such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's scams...
Their opinions are worse than useless.  
You can state your opinion that 2+2=5 all day long,
it does not mean anyone will take you seriously,
and don't be surprised if you're called out for repeating abusive spam.
@_date: 2017-07-19 05:54:21
How is that suppose to fit at all? 
No, we are talking about a known Bad Actor, attacking Bitcoin, Crypto and Open Source.
Jihan and his highwaymen have been nothing but a pain and a continuing danger. 
His dirty bedfellows (hello Ver &amp; Co.) are no better.  Their schemes (ie, this 2x scam) are nothing but destructive.
Calling these snake oil salesmen "part of the community" is completely insane. They are the exact opposite.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:08:57
The 2x is nothing more than a scam by unscrupulous miners. (hello Jihan)  
SegWit is what Bitcoin wants and needs. 
This 2x max block size hard fork, being pushed by scam artists, has been denied again and again, for damn good reason. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 00:59:26
Best Dad Ever!
Thanks to the huge and knowledgeable Bitcoin Project dev team.  They have kept on track all along, given us hugely beneficial scaling strategies (hi SegWit) and kept the bullies at bay (Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.).
There are challenges.  This newest 2x power grab among them,  as so many others in the past (xt, classic, unlimited) that have been denied to Bitcoin's enemies.
The Bitcoin community is strong,  a few ups and downs are par for the course.  
Downs are an oppertunity to invest, and ups... ALLL good.  :)
Onward and upward friends.  The snake oil salesmen (hi Jihan) have no chance against such a dev team, supported by knowledgeable Crypto enthusiasts, as represented by forums such as this sub.
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:25:39
Not at all.  Handing Jihan and his goons even more power with an indiscriminate max block size increase, is the exact *opposite* of safe.
SegWit is a safe and sane, more efficient use of current block size.
That combined with solutions like lightning make this "Big Blocks NOW!" insanity completely a non-issue.
After SegWit activates, we'll have time to develop further *safe* scaling solutions, without the danger of even further mining power centralization that willy-nilly increasing block size would bring.
Also, there is no such thing as "competing implementations" unless you are talking about altcoins. 
You make a client that is incompatible with Bitcion, then you have no business calling it bitcoin.  This is a ground rule in Open Source, and only snake oil salesmen like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. will try to tell you otherwise.
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:12:33
Under Jihan's control, 2 will quickly go to 4, 8, 16 and beyond, until Bitcoin is nothing but another centrally controlled payment method.
We already have credit cards and paypal, so no thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:11:48
bitcoin has had no infighting.
What it had was attacks and hijacking attempts by a few disreputable mining outfits under Jihan's thumb.
The scam that is "emergent consensus" would be a disaster for Bitcoin, leading directly to such bad actors taking complete control of it.
@_date: 2017-07-19 10:01:03
Mine all the Doge you want... it will never work like bitcoin.
The huge and knowedgable Bitcoin dev team, and the proof of worth they have provided, as by far the most accepted Crypto payment world wide,
is what make it work.
Yes, reputable miners that are pro-bitcoin make it work too.
Shady snake oil salesmen such as Jihan &amp; Co are working directly *against* bitcoin, crypto and open source.
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:59:11
As valuable as that CD might be to you,
you could buy orders of magnitude more of them with what's on the OP disks.  :)
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:09:09


No, the only ones that would be happy are shady miners like Jihan and scam artists like Ver and Unlimited.
Simply increasing block size would only increase huge mining outfit centralization, 
directly to the detriment of smaller miners, and bitcoin in general.
Using the current max block size more efficiently would make everyone happy (except get rich quick scam artists like Jihan &amp; Ver). SegWit is the way forward,
 not dangerously increasing max block size, with the even further mining centralization that would create.
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:06:22
"small blockers"  lol
You mean the Bitcoin community that has no interest in seeing Jihan and his goons hijack Bitcoin. 
If Jihan, Ver and co had any shred of legitmacy or integrity, they'd make an alt-coin.  If it was worthy, people would use it.  Even IF they were so honest, they are incapable of such.
They constantly try these destructive hijacking attempts on Bitcoin, purely from greed.  They have nothing of worth to offer whatsoever, except to other bad actors that cooperate with their schemes. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:47:25
Increasing block size *decreases* the number of people that can use Bitcoin. Bandwidth is not available to to all equally. 
SegWit is a safe scaling strategy, optimizing how blocks are used, and opening the door to many others,
without the risk of further centralization that a raw max block size increase brings, let alone a contentious hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:55:35
Which is a good idea, but still useless if the disk is destroyed.
Much better to have multiple backups distributed thrugh multiple locations.
Then again, BTC wasn't worth thousands when these CDs were burned. 
Today (and in the future, much more so!) even one Bitcoin would be worth taking care of carefully. :)
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:04:46
Yes, this is a very real concern.
Thier rediculous scheme for a 2x hard fork will never work though.
It might set bitcoin back, but they have been holding Bitcoin back (blocking SegWit) already.
Let them try to fork. It will be their end, and good riddance. 
Other miners will step in to take their place, or Jihan and his goons will shape up and act responsibly.
It will not be the last threat from such bad actors, but their aggressive hijacking maneuvers are only putting Bitcoin through a test by fire. 
Out will come a more hardened Cryptocurrency, and it will chug right along better than before.
SegWit, and then more SAFE scaling strategies (no 2x or Big Blocks NOW! insanity).  That is the way forward.  
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:56:10
The 2x scam is simply another hijacking attempt by Jihan &amp; Co.
It is the same raw max block size increase they've been denied again and again, for damn good reason.
They need to signal SegWit, as they should have long ago,
but they can forget their fantasy of a 2x hard fork.
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:41:55
Highly doubt they have ever gotten close to that deadly 51%.
If they had the capability, they could have taken over bitcoin completely by now,
instead of just greedily blocking its progress until their hand was forced by the threatened UASF.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:44:01




How the hell you got your disinformation out of that is anyone's guess. Please stop.
willy-nilly incerasing block size also gives already-too-large mining outfits an even greater advantage. This is a huge risk to Bitcoin and must be avoided.
There is zero reason to even still be talking about block size, with SegWit around the corner.
Jihan's 2x scam is just another hijacking maneuver. The LAST thing Bitcoin needs.
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:45:34
That's all fine and dandy.  Bitcoin will just keep chugging along.
There is absolutely zero reason to give into destructive takeover attempts like Jihan and Ver are running. Unscrupulous mining outfits (Jihan) and blatant takeover attempts (Ver) are to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
Simply increasing max block size would be directily in their benefit, which is why they spend so much money on disinformation on forums like /btc. Blatant shilling and brigading on legitimate cryptocurrency forums all over the internet (such as this one).
We are all much better off just keeping status quo than giving into their destructive demands.  That way leads only to the full centralization and control of bitcoin. This must be avoided, at all costs, if we want bitcoin to survive.
Thankfully, such get-rich-quick scams are getting easier and easier to spot.  Bitcoin has been attacked by XT, Classic, now Unlimited, and unscrupulous mining concerns that are blocking the best thing for it (SegWit).  
If they really cared (they do not) they'd signal SegWit immediately.  What that allows would produce actual answers to scaling problems.
They have zero interest in actual answers, only more centralization of mining power, and get-rich-quick takeover attempts.
oh yah, and if you're making $2 a day, how the hell are you going to transfer enough bitcoin to rack up a ludicrous  $2 transaction fee?  Out of who's ass did you pull that "logic"?
IF someone under those conditions scrimped and saved enough for a huge transaction, that actually benefited from such a large fee, it would be damn well worth it.
Simply upping max block size would completely exclude them from even using bitcoin at all. Scam mining outfits like Jihan runs would be able to charge whatever they wanted, because they would be in complete control of supply.
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:23:07
I suppose you buy into /btc 's, Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's way of thinking?
What a crock.  Not that it's so complex, but the ridiculous "hivemind" comment, and your section on scaling shows nothing but your own bias.
The reality of the situation is that such shady actors as mentioned above have been doing their damnedest (and failing) to hijack bitcoin with their scams.
Ver with XT, Classic, Unlimited,
Jihan with btc1, 2x, just to name a few.  
There is no real scaling debate. Bitcoin devs, community, and the majority of miners are on the same page: SegWit is the way forward.
It is unscrupulous snake oil salsemen like Jihan, Ver and their goons that have been holding back progress. Not to mention promoting their scams on cesspools of disinformation such as /btc.
@_date: 2018-04-19 09:35:21
That doesn't happen unless you step WAY over the line.
This, and other legit crypto forums are consistently brigaded with all kinds of FUD and anti-bitcoin propaganda from the likes of Ver &amp; Co.
The mods here are tollerant almost to a fault. I'd bin that spam with a quickness, but as things are, the lies are allowed to stay, and be debunked again and again,
just as this ridiculous "cencorship!" tripe has been debunked, again, and again.
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:05:11
BCH scam has zero to do with the open source, crypto, or Bitcoin communities. 
Ver's latest scam coin is just another attack on those communities. Latest in a long line. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:29:27
By what stretch of the imagination can simply increasing max block size be considered beneficial,
when we have a safe and sane solution (SegWit) that does exactly that, but without the risk of further mining power centralization.
We need to work AGAINST further centralization, not encourage it.
Saying "it gonna happun anyway" is ridiculous.  If we go about things slowly and carefully, that trend can be reversed.
In fact, you just made a very good argument for *decreasing* the current max block size. It is too large already.
@_date: 2017-07-23 06:06:16
Nobody in their right mind (that isn't in on the scam) is going to use some buggy code from a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control.
Jihan's ABC, 2x, btc1 ... are all about as serious as Ver's xt, classic and unlimited.  Not at all.
@_date: 2017-07-20 07:52:53


IF that was true (highly unlikely, judging by your pattern of attacking bitcoin),
Then I'd suggest learning the first thing about Crypto and Bitcoin, 
before actively and aggressively repeating blatant disinformation and propaganda against it.
Your "analysis" is from the same people trying to hijack bitcoin.
It is a well known dynamic, has been explained to you yahoos again and again, but you still insist on spamming lies.
Now, back to /btc with you, the lot of ya, where such destructive anti-bitcoin behavior is welcome.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:40:17
No, right now this is just signalling SegWit.
Later, Jihan will try to get everyone to move over to his buggy code, abandoning the actual Bitcoin dev team.   
lol.. oh man that's gonna be funny.  Even if he DID get anyone to run his code,
the vast majority and largest exchanges have said they will not accept a shady hard fork. 
And that's exactly what 2xHF will be.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:08:33
No, there is only one Bitcoin project. It will continue,
and there will always be scams from snake oil salesemen such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. We've seen a long line of them already.  XT, Classic, Unlimited, btc1, 2x, BCC, ABC etc...
Thankfully, such unscrupulous and destructive takeover attempts are easier and easier to spot.
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:55:03

It's getting brigaded pretty hard. :/
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:39:07
Who the hell things SegWit is bad,

No, the paid shills they employ (lookin' at you /btc) don't count.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:02:54
It's not ALL the miners.  Just unscrupulous ones like Jihan and his goons, and the other mining outfits he has under his thumb.
There are plenty of serious, respectable mining outfits.
That said, yah, this latest 2x scam is DOA.
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:05:18
You have to understand,  legitimate crypto forums have been under constant attack by these snake oil salemen (see the link about paid shills).
People have grown very tired of constantly battling such fud.
You can explain with logic all you want, so often when confronted with facts, these trolls simply resort to outright lies, misdirection, and in the end, downright shit-slinging.
So often a seemingly innocent question such as yours, is just bait for a such a propaganda campaign.  
Right now, with this newest 2x and BCC scam Jihan is pushing, and while the Bitcoin community is waiting with baited breath for SegWit to FINALLY go forward,  things are more heated than usual.
Unless Jihan throws a monkey wrench in the works, (which he's well known for), SegWit will be locked in by the beginning of August. 
Then things will calm down.   Well, bad actors will still push their hostile scams, but SegWit, and Bitcoin won't be blocked from progress  as much. 
Anyway, don't take it too personally if you get curt answers to such questions. It's the fault of abusive propagandists that plauge legit forums like this. :/
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:31:21
no 2x needed.  Let them signal segwit, as they should have all along,
but their ridiculous 2x hard fork is DOA.
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:05:52
Status Quo is just fine. 
Or, what 80+% of bitcoin experts and advocates *actually* want:  SegWit.
Zero "compromise" needed.
@_date: 2017-07-19 10:05:19
Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have proven their hostility to Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, and Open Source all along.
This has zero ad hominym.  
Tell us one thing they have contributed to the Bitcoin project that was not motivated by pure greed.
Hijacking attempts galore,  pitiful ones at that.
Delaying tactics, that have now been dealt with.
and IF they have the balls to try a block size increase HF,  lol...
Nope.  They have zero to offer but stress and strife.  
I HOPE they try for their HFork. It will be the end of them and Bitcoin will be all the better.
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:16:58

You want anyone to take that crap seriously?
Name your sources or get out.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:14:24
A legitimate fork is called an alt-coin.  It uses its own name and blockchain.
What Jihan, Ver and co are constantly attempting are hostile takeover attempts.
They create nothing.  Please don't call them forks, they are nothing of the kind.
An altcoin is a fork.  Or a hard fork that comes from the Bitcoin dev team. 
You're right though, such attacks on Bitcoin by such bad actors can only make Bitcoin stronger against them.
We saw this with the threatened UASF, that is ultimately what forced Jihan and his troop of gangsters to finally do the right thing and signal for SegWit.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:10:40
The OP comic is criticizing Jihan's 2x scam, not SegWit itself. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:18:25
No need to do that to stop Jihan's 2x scam.
Once SegWit is irreversibly locked in, such ridiculous hijacking maneuvers can be ignored.
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:56:49
You support Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's hostile takeover attempts.
As is extremely clear.  Constantly spamming anti-bitcoin propaganda like you (and your colleagues) do.
It's very easy to spot.  lol, you people really need a new script.
If you are truely independant of Jihan's destructive schemes, but still fully support them,
then your motives are bad, and your goals also to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.
This latest of Jihan's desperate hijacking manouvers, 2x, is one in a LONG line.  They all have been denied again and again.
You can tell all the stories you want, but willy-nilly upping the block size is not the way forward. More mining power centralization is the LAST thing Bitcoin needs.
SegWit, and all the SAFE scaling measures it opens the door to must be fully explored first.  
Now that bad actors such as Jihan and his unscrupulous mining concerns (include yourself if you see fit) have been forced to FINALLY signal SegWit by the threat of a UASF,
finally Bitcoin can start doing this important work.
Until these safe and sane options are exhausted, there is zero need for any discussion about increasing block size.
We've all had plenty enough of you and your your cronies' "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda.
Give it a rest, or go tell your stories over on /btc where such disinformation is welcome.  It is well known for promoting abusive snake oil salesmen like Jihan, Ver (and it seems you want to include yourself) in their anti-Bitcoin, anti-crypto, anti-Open Source schemes.
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:49:23
Segwit is a defacto increase in block size,
but it is NOT a raw max block size increase. That would require a hard fork.  
Don't confuse Jihan's 2x scam for SegWit. He had no business using that name for his schemes.
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:44:46
Please don't call it a "debate".  
The "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda comes from unscrupulous miners (hi Jihan) trying to hijack bitcoin.
Willy-nilly increasing max block size would give them a huge advantage, even further centralizing mining power.
Not gonna happen. They have been denied such hijacking maneuvers again and again, for damn good reason.
SegWit is a safe and sane more efficient use of block size.  After it activates we can talk about further SAFE scaling strategies.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:07:25
What a steaming pile of disinformation.
There was no need to rush into anything.
Now we have SegWit all ready to go.
The only ones NOT wanting safe and sane scaling methods are the disreputable miners and scam artists like Jihan and Ver. They are actively hurting bitcoin for their own greed.
The only bad blood is caused by their hijacking attempts, and propaganda, disinformation, and downright shit slinging campaigns. (which Mr. burger just repeated).
Take this crap back to /btc where it belongs. We've had all too much of it.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:10:20
There is no "debate",  just more of the same disinformation and propaganda from the likes of Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
We're all rather wary of their constant hijacking attempts.
SegWit or Status Quo.
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:41:37
There are plenty of mining outfits that act responsibly and support Bitcoin progress. Have been behind SegWit right along with the rest of the Bitcoin community and devs. 
Don't confuse them with bad actors such as Jihan and his goons that have been blocking it so agressively. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:47:34
I'd not say most.  Definitely Jihan, his goons, and some mining concerns that are under his thumb.
Most miners are reputable and wouldn't risk destroying their reputation as Jihan has.
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:45:55
Users want safety and longevity. Lower fees can also be achieved with SegWit and the scaling mechanics it offers.
Legitimate, trustworthy  miners want the same, and have shown it by supporting SegWit all along.
Some unscrupulous mining outfits (hi Jihan) are only interested in instant gratification profits, and Bitcoin be damned. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:27:01
This laughable NY "agreement" is nothing but him and his cronies agreeing with *themselves*.  Just like the ridiculous HK "agreement" before it.
Just another hijacking attempt.  They have been denied again and again.
Where is the list of these gangsters that Jihan had sign onto his ludicrous NY scam?
It's good to know who Bitcoin's enemies are.  None of them can be trusted in the least.
@_date: 2017-07-03 06:14:47
It has been known for a long time that this latest scam of Roger Ver's (xt, classic, now unlimited) have no technological value.
This latest attempt, Unlimited coin, is written by a handful of completely incompetent "devs", as has been abundantly demonstrated, again and again! The links below are *just a beginning*.
The Bitcoin Community is well aware, and nobody in their right mind will turn Bitcoin over to this snake oil salesman Ver and his ridiculously broken software teams. Not to mention the shady mining concerns (hello Jihan &amp; Co) that supported it before it became so blatantly obvious that it was Dead On Arrival.
Some background on the dangers of this Unlimited nonsense:
[These three well written articles by Aaron van Wirdum explain BU's 'Emergent Consensus' (spoiler alert - it's got issues)](
Even more damning, a complete rundown of the blatant, wilful scam that is Unlimited:
[**The Astounding Incompetence, Negligence, and Dishonesty of the Bitcoin Unlimited Developers**](
As if that was not enough! 
Add to this the [Damning evidence on how Bitcoin Unlimited pays shills.]( 
Roger Ver has no shred of integrity, honesty or trustworthiness in him. He and his cohorts such as Jihan &amp; Co are shunned with extreme prejudice by the Bitcoin and Crypto community, as well as Open Source in general, for for their destructive practices.
Just as his latest hijacking attempt, Unlimited is, Jihan's 2x hijack attempt is, 
as well as the cesspools of disinformation and propaganda they use to organize their paid brigading (hello /btc).
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:53:00
Who the hell in their right mind is going to trust a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control?  Nobody that isn't in on the scam. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:32:32
Don't think they've gotten that far.  If they had gotten to 51% already, Bitcoin would already be dead in the water.
No, they're not THAT strong. Look up with a deadly threat the 51% attack is.
Jihan and his goons *are* dangerous though. They have enough to block SegWit, or any other legitimate progress, and constantly are pushing for centralization that would allow them to completely hijack bitcoin.
This latest 2x scam (and the joke that is the NY"agreement"), is nothing more than a max block size increase, with no protections against even further mining power centralization. 
This would be insane. Not gonana happen. It has been denied again, and again, for damn good reason.

They don't have a real solution yet. Gonna be funny watching it crach n burn. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 02:10:00


The exact opposite is true.  Indescriminately increasing max block size, and the even further mining centralization that would encourage, is infinitely more risky than just letting bitcoin chug along as it is now.
There is zero technological reason for larger max block size. Giving into unscrupulous mining concerns is not an option.
SegWit, and its more efficient use of the block size we have now, is the way forward.
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:40:37
Raw max block size increase will only encourage even more mining power centralization. This is *all* bad.
First SegWit, then we come up with other equally *safe* solutions if needed.
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:04:31
Some disreputable miners wanted even more advantage and mining power centralization for their own greed (hello Jihan &amp; Co.), and have been blocking Bitcoin progress (SegWit) for months and months. They have no interest in "compromise".
Only when their strong arm tactics were met with equally strong countermeasures (UASF) did they shape up, under fear of being shipped out.
Let them signal SegWit, as they should have LONG ago, as trustworthy miners have for so long.
Jihan's 2x &amp; btc1 scams are directly against Bitcoin's longevity and usefulness. Such has been denied these aggressive (attempted) hijackers again and again, for damn good reason.
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:16:56
Take your support for unscrupulous mining concerns under Jihan's thumb, and his hijacking attempts, back to /btc where they are welcome.
These are non-questions you're asking, as is all too obvious.
If you are realy this naive about how cryptocurrency, specifically bitcoin works, then you need to do some learning, 
instead of blasting this anti-bitcoin spam on legitimate crypto forums.
I mean, go ahead, the mods here are *extremely* tolerant, but people here do know what's up, so don't expect this crap to not be called out for exactly what it is. 
Propaganda and disinformation, like we've seen all too often from Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
Let Jihan &amp; Co make their OWN DAMN ALTXCOIN. They have no right to hijack another open source project like they are constantly trying. This destructive behavior is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just crypto and bitcoin.
If they came up with something worthy, people would use it.  They cannot, as they have proven again and again.
Nobody in their right mind is going to use Bitcion software written by a handful of incompetent devs under Jihan's control. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:50:19
Which is an infinitely safer and saner solution that a ridiculously dangerous raw max block size increase (that Jihan is so desperately pushing for).
SegWit is the way forward. Jihan &amp; his goons need to get on board, or get left behind.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:01:49


oh god, this shit again.  Suuurreee buddy.  Didn't Jihan or Ver try to push this crap a couple months ago?
Nobody run full nodes!  Leave it ALL to US! eherm.. all to miners.
Also, nobody is bashing reputable miners that act with integrity.
Disreputable miners, ones like Jihan, fully deserve to be called out on their bullshit.

If they did anything so absolutely insane, merging this latest 2x scam into actual Bitcoin, there soon would be nothing left recognisable as Bitcoin.
2x is just the latest power grab by unscrupulous gansters such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
Damn right it ain't gonna happen. Let them signal SegWit, but their 2x bullshit is a fantasy. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:13:22
The Bitcoin project.  It is Bitcoin's blockchain.
A legitimate altcoin uses its own, and has its own name.
Shady hijacking attempts like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co attempt, just try to mooch off the success of an already established project.
That is not how open source works, at all.  Shady as fuck.
If you don't understand this, instead of spewing disinformation about things you don't understand (especially in support of such shady bad actors),  go learn the first thing about open source projects and the community around them.
It is common knowledge that this crap just don't fly.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:20:01

If they did, they would make a legitimate altcoin,
instead of trying to hijack an already established project.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:11:33
Irrelevant. The world has changed. There are forces active now that Satoshi had no idea would come into play, or not as destructively as they are seen today.
Shady gangsters such as Jihan's unscrupulous mining outfits gaining so much mining power centralization was unknown back then. Also destructive hijacking attempts like Ver constantly tries, didn't exist. Neither did the propaganda and disinformation bad actors such as these pay for, such as you are repeating.
@_date: 2017-07-25 10:51:55
It has nothing to do with "trademarks",
it has to do with integrity, honesty and trust.
of which scam artiststs and snake oil salesmen such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have proven themselves to be completely lacking in. As well as the anti-Bitcoin spammers supporting them. 
Bitcoin is run by the Community, and a huge and knowledgeable Dev team, as well as miners loyal to the Bitcoin project. All of which have been supporting SegWit all along.
Jihan &amp; his goons are none of them. Are working directly against the Bitcoin community, devs and legitimate miners.  And if you support his abusive hijacking maneuvers, neither are you.


More blatant anti-bitcoin propaganda.  Never happened. There has been an almost deafening silence from Bitcoin project devs on Jihan's latest scams. If anything they pointed out a deadly bug in Jihan's btc1 scam. Jihan's Big Block scheme wasn't even coded to increase max block size. lol
What you are talking about in the quote though, is the *community and miner driven* UASF, that forced Jihan and his goons to shape up. The Bitcoin devs stayed neutral on that all along.
Now, once again, saunter off to the community you came from, over there at /btc, where your propaganda and anti-open source, anti-bitcoin spam and  disinformation is welcome.
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:59:20
Except that all evidence, the anti-bitcioin spam you've been spewing here, is very damn obvious.
This, and other legitimate crypto forums all over the web, have been bombarded with this nonsense for months and months now.  It's very easy to spot. You guys really need a new script. heh
IF, by some freak accident, you're just so genuinely naive about how Bitcoin works, the scams Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are responsible for (this thread being about only one of the newest in a LONG line), 
then your aggressive, hostile, and naive assertions are still equally anti-Bitcioin. In THAT case, you need to learn some basics before you come into a legit forum repeating such nonsense and being so abusive.
Act like a shill (and ohhh there are many, this thread is getting brigaded hard), don't expect a loving welcome.
Treat others with a modicum of respect, ask honest questions, and this and other legit crypto forums are a cornucopia of knowledge.  From your posts here, it is very obvious you have zero interest in learning anything, just shit slinging.
Now, saunter along back to /btc, where such propaganda is welcome.
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:06:28
No, "simply" increasing max block size is not an answer whatsoever. This would only encourage even greater mining power centralization.
The only "pissing" is coming from destructive hijackers such as Jihan's already-too-large mining conglomerate. 
SegWit is the only answer we currently have, and the only one we need for now.  It is being blocked by destructive, greedy influences is all. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:32:01
Please don't attach the good name of SegWit 
to Jihan &amp; Co's latest 2x scam.

This 2x scam,  handing over control of Bitcoin to undsrupulous snake oil salesmen such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, would the the death of everything good about Bitcoin.
Nobody in their right mind is going to use buggy code by a handful of devs under Jihan's control.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:25:08
No, trying to hijack the resources of an already established project is shady af.  
If they wanted to create legitimate competition on the free market, they would create an altcoin, instead of hostility attempting to take over an already established one.
Once again, Jihan shows he hasn't a shred of integrity or trustworthiness.

There are no "both sides".
There is bitcoin,  
and there are unscrupulous mining concerns that already are far too centralized.
Willy-nilly increasing max block size will only encourage even more mining power centralization. There is zero reason to do this.
SegWit is a more efficient use of the blocksize we have now, a de-facto 2mb block equivalent. And it does it without the tremendous risk of even further mining power centralization. 
@_date: 2016-05-26 04:52:23

My god what a shit show. :( 
This opt-in nonsense is no protection at all. 
Not only that, they don't even have the code ready! And they want to go live with this within the week?  LOL
Also, notice the blatant disinformation; Referring to the Bitcoin blockchain and "BCC blockchain" as somehow separate.
No, they are spamming their crap on the Bitcoin blockchain, when they should be using their own.
Just more proof that this is nothing more than another hostile takeover attempt. From the looks of things, one bound to crash and burn horribly.  
No legitimate exchange is going to trade this joke, not without solid assurance of *actual* replay protection.
Jihan and his BCC yahoos have no business using anything that even *sounds* like the Bitcoin name, let alone abusively experimenting with their joke of a code base on the productive Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:00:52

ahhh 91...  Right.  all these BIP's flying around I missed that he's not talking about SegWit at all,  but the other silly stuff Jihan wants as ransom for signalling SegWit.
No bother, once SegWit is activated, his silly 2x scam won't matter.
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:06:01
No reason to until some safer, saner scaling methods are implemented.
A raw max block size increase is not the magic bullet that Jihan and his goons have been promoting it as. Quite the opposite, it would give such bad actors even more mining power centralization.
MUCH better to work on actual solutions without that risk.
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:54:08

It has been known for a long time that this latest scam of Roger Ver's (xt, classic, now unlimited) have no technological value.
This latest attempt, Unlimited coin, is written by a handful of completely incompetent "devs", as has been abundantly demonstrated, again and again! The links below are *just a beginning*.
The Bitcoin Community is well aware, and nobody in their right mind will turn Bitcoin over to this snake oil salesman Ver and his ridiculously broken software teams. Not to mention the shady mining concerns (hello Jihan &amp; Co) that supported it before it became so blatantly obvious that it was Dead On Arrival.
Some background on the dangers of this Unlimited nonsense:

As if that was not enough!  (thanks to /stringliterals for the excellent writeup and links.)
Add to this the [Damning evidence on how Bitcoin Unlimited pays shills.]( 
Roger Ver has no shred of integrity, honesty or trustworthiness in him. He and his cohorts such as Jihan &amp; Co are shunned with extreme prejudice by the Bitcoin and Crypto community, as well as Open Source in general, for for their destructive practices.
Just as his latest hijacking attempt, Unlimited is, Jihan's 2x hijack attempt is,

Can, and should are two different things.
I CAN knock you over the head and steal your wallet.
Don't mean it's a good thing.  
There's a reason that such hijacking maneuvers, and those guilty of them, are shunned in any serious open source community.
Not like Jihan has any type of good reputation to ruin, but he's just digging the hole deeper with these continued takeover attempts.
@_date: 2017-07-09 11:16:59


Yes, in the world of cryptocurrency, this is what the term "centralization" refers to.
It has nothing to do with the Open Source code base.  That is open to fork as anyone pleases.
What is NOT ok is to hijack the resources of another Open Source project's *resources*.  i.e. Its name, and in the case of a cryptocurrency project, its blockchain.
Such shady behavior is discouraged in the Open Source community with extreme prejudice, for very good reason.
Reasons that have nothing to do with the specific cryptocurrency jargon "centralization", which, again, refers only to mining (and possibly node) centralization, as you so astutely described.
Snake oil salesmen like Ver have tried and tried to use that specific term "centralization" as an attack, fully out of context. Please don't repeat such blatant disinformation. 
There is only one Bitcoin project. Its name and blockchain belong to the Bitcoin project. Anyone is free to make a pull request to it. If it is worthy, it is accepted. Ver &amp; co have done no such thing, ever.
Not with any of his hijacking attempts. Not XT, Classic, or this latest scam Unlimited. Never once has he contributed anything of worth to Bitcoin, only attacked it.
Altcoins are fully healthy and a very Good Thing. If Ver (or anyone) made an altcoin that had merit, hell, I might use it, and surely others. There are many examples of such (hello Litecoin).  None as good as bitcoin, but True competition is always good.  
Ver and his shady partners (hi Jihan)  have shown, consistently, and annoyingly constantly, that they have neither the interest, nor the capability of offering legitimate competition.
Trying to abusively hijack the resources of another project are the exact opposite.
**TL;DR  There are no other forms of centralization in the BTC ecosystem. What should be addressed are the abusive hijacking attempts from snake oil salesmen such as Ver, Jihan (hello 2x NY"A") and Co.**
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:03:45

Typical of such brigades.  Notice:
When confronted with people that know how crypto and open source actually works, that are not swayed by illogical cries to emotion, such anti-bitcoin propaganda agents have no resort but downright shit-slinging. 
This, also, we have seen again and again over the last years. 
It is standard MO for shills and brigades, suporters of Jihan, Ver and their cronies' scams.
The pattern is as obvious and typical as it is abusive. :(
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:05:21
Nobody in their right mind (that knows the first thing about bitcoin anyway) wants to just willy-nilly increase max block size.
Not without protections from the very real threat of even further mining power centralization that would bring.
Not all the world has the bandwidth to handle bigger blocks. They're arguably too big now! 
More effecient use of those blocks is the way forward, and SegWit is the logical solution.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:06:02
There is no split in the community, and no debate. 
What there is, is a ton of propaganda and disinformation from Jihan, Ver &amp;Co supporting their scams. 
The Bitcoin community, devs and legit miners have supported SegWit all along. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:57:46
There never was any HK "agreement". 2x is just another such agressive hijacking attempt by Jihan &amp;Co. 
Only him and his cronies agreed with themselves about their schemes. Please take your disinformation back to /BTC where it came from.

No, SegWit is the safe and sane way forward.
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:44:08
Drive space is not the limiting factor.  Bandwidth is.
Upping the max block size will push smaller mining concerns even further out, and offer even more monopoly / centralization.
The last thing we need.  Which is why such scams and scemes have been denied Jihan &amp; Co again and again (2x is just his latest power grab).
And poorer areas, more remote areas would suffer from a raw max block size increase. Some already struggle with the current blocks size.  Bitcoin should be usable by everyone, ultimately, not just the rich.
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:03:54
Yes, and safely, unlike Jihan's schemes. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:01:10
The reality is exactly the opposite.  The anti-bitcion, pro-Jihan propaganda he floods legit crypto forums with (including here) rarely has any logical thought behind it.
Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. have constantly and consistently proven that they have nothing of value to add to the crypto world. 
Instead of creating legitimate competition with their own altcoin, they resort to hijacking attempts of an already established project. This type of shady behavior is discouraged in all of Open Source, not just crypto and Bitcoin communities.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:07:19
Jihan only cares what's best for his bank account. Doesn't give a that's ass about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:28:08
Bingo.  Which is exactly why willy-nilly increasing max block size is so dangerous.
It gives already too large mining concerns a huge advantage in this race, and would even further centralize mining power.
This is why unscrupulous miners such as Jihan &amp; his goons are so desperately trying to push their "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda.
They are working only for their own greed, directly to the harm of Bitcoin, Crypto and Open Source.
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:08:23
There was no "agreement" except for the snake oil salesmen Jihan &amp; Co. agreeing with themselves. This is the exact same power grab they've been trying all along, and have been denied again, and again, for damn good reason.
All it took to get them to stop blocking Bitcoin progress (SegWit),  was the threat of a UASF, that would ship them out if they didn't shape up.

@_date: 2017-07-21 05:51:18
No,  once SegWit is active, there's no more need to discuss any of the current hard fork proposals. 
Well, Jihan will cry and shout about his 2x scam not going through, and it'll be fun to laugh at that, but that's not a discussion any more than his NY or Japan circuses were "agreements".
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:13:13
Jihan's latest 2x power grab was DOA anyway.
Let them go ahead and signal SegWit, as they should have LONG ago...
After that it doesn't matter how much he screams and howls about some bogus "agreement" he made with his cronies.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:16:54
Good luck finding any fools willing to offer anything of value for Jihan's newest ScamCoin.  He's threatened crap like this again and again. 
Nobody in their right mind is going to invest in buggy code, from a handful of incompetent devs, under Jihan's control.  Nobody that isn't in on the scam anyway.
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:36:15
Nothing could be further from the truth.  The community wants SegWit,  and solutions like Lightning.
After that, we can talk about further SAFE scaling measures.  
The LAST thing anyone wants is handing gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. even more power, which is what willy-nilly increasing max block size would do.
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:02:23
None of this is relevant to Bitcoin whatsoever.
It was a shady deal done with some shady miners (hi Jihan) by a few individuals. 
None of it had a chance of ever being implemented, regardless what lies they were telling each other.
It is pretty funny though that Jihan &amp; Co broke their shady little deal first.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:19:46
Theoretically,  if you can find anyone stupid enough to buy a doomed hijacking attempt. IF Jihan, Ver and co actaully went through with their threats,  (this is only the latest in a long line of vaporware from them), their bogus version will be very short lived.
If by some miracle you find someone willing to offer anything of worth for their doomed currency, take advantage immediately before they lose their shirt.
@_date: 2017-07-23 09:30:47
hahah   no,
The threat of a UASF worked. 
SegWit was supported by the Bitcoin community, devs and trustworthy miners all along.
Jihan and the other unscrupulous miners under his thumb were blocking it, and Bitcoin progress.
Their 2x scam had nothing to do with today's events.
And let's not count our chickens before they hatch. If these snake oil salesmen are known for anything,
it's shady shenanigans.  They could still try to throw a monkey wrench into the works.
Once SegWit is irreversibly activated, THEN we can celebrate.
@_date: 2017-07-20 10:05:29
SegWit has consensus,
Jihan's 2x scam was DOA.

@_date: 2017-07-02 18:21:46
OP is fully correct: Actual SegWit, or status quo.
The only thing OP got wrong is: there is no "debate" at all.  
There are the ones working AGAINST Bitcoin, Crypto and Open Source:
such as Jihan, Ver and Co, their paid shills on forums like /btc with their "Big Blocks NOW!" power grabs, 
and lately this "2x" scam,  or shady hijacking projects such as XT, Classic, and lately Unlimited.   
These gangsters have been denied a raw max block size increase again and again. It would only give them more power, pushing smaller mining concerns and users even further out of their way. They want total centralization. Giving them their way would be the death of everything good about bitcoin / crypto in general.  NOT going to happen. 
Again there is no debate, just blatant a disinformation and propaganda campaign from snake oil salesmen such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. 
This is what people realize after learning a bit about cryptocurrencies, even on that cesspool of disinformation /btc that promotes such.  Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are quickly discarded as the snake oil salesmen they are.
and on the other side is the actual, bona fide Bitcoin project, its huge team of expert and knowledgeable devs, and the bitcoin /crypto /open source community, that are being attacked. This subreddit represents one small part of the larger Bitcoin universe internet-wide, and we've all seen far too much of such hostile takeover attempts.
SegWit is key. The vast majority of Crypto and Bitcoin experts are all for it, as well as the actual community.
SegWit or Status Quo is the way forward. (no 2x bullshit)

As opposed to BCC, which nobody but a few unscrupulous miners in China 
might pretend to use, for a very short time.
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:41:52
The only ones you are supporting are abusive hijackers (Jihan &amp; Co.), trying to take over an open source project (Bitcoin) for their own selfish gain. 
Let them offer *actual* competition with their own altcoin, as they should have, instead of constantly attacking and blocking progress of another project.
Hell, if they were actually capable of creating anything of worth, people would use it.  They are not, as they have so clearly shown again and again. 
The anti-bitcoin propaganda you're repeating would be very welcome at the cesspool of disinformation that is /btc. Why don't you just saunter on back over there now...
@_date: 2017-05-18 02:06:26
There are a lot of shills paid for by that one person, 
and sadly, some cryptocurrency newbies that he's fooled with such blatant propaganda and disinformation.
Truth is, as Mr Math stated, there is zero actual technological reason to willy-nilly increase max block size.
(unless you count benefiting unscrupulous miners that want even more centralized mining power a "reason")
@_date: 2017-07-19 10:09:58
You are the only one that has no idea what he's talking about...
Possibly some script you got from Jihan &amp; Co, maybe repeating disinformation from that cesspool /btc,
but zero actual knowledge about Bitcoin, Crypto, or Open Source.
There was no NY "agreement" except between snake oil salesmen such as those named above.  Their agreement was with nobody but themselves.  "jerking each other off" is fully apt,
and once again (hello Japan "agreement") trying to pass this off as anything remotely legitimate;  A complete joke.
Jihan, go ahead and signal SegWit, like the rest of the Bitcoin community has. Like you should have LONG ago.
If not, there is the USAF looming!  Oh! Look, that did get results. just lke on Litecoin. :)
Jihan and his goons are signalling Segwiit now, no 2x scam required.  That bullshit was DOA. 
Let's just be kind and let him save face though. *Pretend* signalling Segwit was his idea, and it had anything to do with his 2x power grab.
If he starts complaining that the 2x "agreement" didn't go through, then we'll  heartily laugh at his ridiculous, oh so transparent schemes.
In the meantime, Bitcoin is, and will be, doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:35:53
It never was a debate. A number of unscrupulous miners have been trying to hijack Bitcoin. Jihan and Co have been working directly against Bitcoin devs and community. 
What they propose is in no way a compromise, just another hijacking attempt. 
The reason they have finally given up blocking SegWit and Bitcoin progres is that a user activated soft fork was threatened. They decided to shape up, instead of being shipped out. 
There are plenty of trustworhty miners that back Bitcoin, that have been signalling and supporting it's progress all along. The OP gif is not about them, 
it is poking fun at the few destructive ones that have been so greedy and aggressively anti-Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:15:47
Such shady hijacking is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of open source, for danm good reason. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:10:03
What Jihan is constantly pushing for is in no way compromise. His and his cronies (hello Ver) hijacking attempts have been denied again and again, for damn good reason. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:10:30
The majority of the largest exchanges have said, in no uncertain terms, that such a contentious hard fork will not be treated as legitimate. 
Jihan &amp; Co have been loudly, annoyingly barking for all too long now, but they still have no bite.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:35:19
Where did you get the idea that this newest BCC scam has replay protection?
With the tiny handful of completely incompetent devs Jihan has, it will be incredible if they can get even one transaction to work, let alone guarantee replay protection.
And yes, it is another direct attack on Bitcoin. Attempting to hijack another project's resources is shady af. Shows how low Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are.  
They need to go make their own damn altcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:59:51
The only toxicity comes from shady characters (Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.) constantly attempting to hijack Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:24:47
SegWit will activate, and Bitcoin will continue on as always.
The 2x scam Jihan is pushing for was DOA. That'll never happen.
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:35:08
More anti-bitcoin spam.  Take that back to /btc and other such cesspools of disinformation where it belongs.
"Centralization" is jargon that is specific to cryptocurrency, Bitcoin in particular.  It has *zero* to do with software.
**Centralization in the context of Bitcoin refers only to mining power and full nodes.**
This has been explained again and again when this, and other legitimate crypto forums, are brigaded by anti-bitcoin advocates promoting aggressive takeover schemes from Ver, Jihan &amp; Co.
Those that repeat such disinformation, trying to falsely use the term "centralization" to describe software, are only supporting hostile takeover attempts such bad actors are guilty of.
Such is discouraged in all of Open Source, with extreme prejudice.
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:07:36
If it is useful, after fully exploring safer options, then ok,
But NOT the way Jihan has tried to ram it through from his own reckless and abusive greed. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:15:49
It's really stupidly played by Jihan and his goons.  Tehre's no way in hell this 2x scam will go through.  Nobody in their right mind is going to use software written by a handful of devs under Jihan's control.
They can go ahead and signal SegWit, as they should have LONG ago, but their 2x power grab was DOA.
@_date: 2017-07-05 11:14:16


That this 2x scam is merely another power grab attempt by gansters such as Jihan and his shady goons. Unscrupulous mining interests only out for their own good, making (yet another) attack.
They have been denied a raw max block size increase again and again, for damn good reason. They only want it because they know it would give them an advantage, and push smaller mining concerns even farther out of the picture.
Not gonna happen.
Let them signal *actual* SegWit (as they should have all along), but their 2x hard fork silliness is complete lunacy.
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:12:19
Realistically, Jihan and his goons have not promised Bitcoin anything, they just promised *themselves* their own shady plans (including the 2x &amp; btc1 scams). 
They must comply with the Bitcion community and project, signal for SegWit, or get left behind. Simple as that.
@_date: 2017-07-08 18:54:19
What a load of crap. How much did the banks pay this Cooper yahoo for that shilling??
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:26:48
The 2x scam is another hijacking attempt, and in no way "compromise". 
Jihan and his goons can signal SegWit, as they should have long ago,
but they can forget their reddiculous 2x power grab. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:01:30
Lol...With the the handful of incompetent devs Jihan has?
It will be amazing if they can even get their bcc crap to run at all.
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:30:17
There is no "comporomise" with shady actors that want to completly control Bitcoin.
Jihan Ver &amp; Co are not interested in compromise, nor should they be given any.  They are the only ones holding things back.
SegWit has been ready to go for months, with overwhelming support. Only the unscrupulous miners under Jihan's thumb are destructively holding back progress.
"compromising" with them would be pure folly. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:51:49
None of that story is in the slightest way relevant to Bitcoin.
You are supporting nothing more than another in a long line of aggressive hijacking scams from bad actors such as Ver, Jihan &amp; Co.
Don't act surprised when spamming anti-bitcoin propaganda is treated as such.
You will find the people at /btc, that promote such scams, much more friendly to your cause. Why don't you just mosey back on over there now...
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:08:04
By not doing dangerous things that would give some unscrupulous miners (hi Jihan) even more mining power centralization,
like willy-nillly increasing max block size. Such hijacking maneuvers have been denied Jihan and his goons again, and again, for damn good reason. Still they try... scams like 2x, btc1 etc are nothing but attacks on Bitcion, its dev team, trustworthy miners, and community.
Anyway, this whole "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda will be irrelevant once SegWit goes live.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:48:08


Where did you hear that?
If you mean the ridiculous HK"agreement", it was nothing of the sort.  That was just some unscrupulous miners and their cronies agreeing with themselves.
Much like this latest NY"agreement", and the 2x scam that came out of it.  It has nothing to do with Bitcoin or its roadmap. They are just hostile takeover attempts from Jihan &amp; Co.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:59:34
Thanks reputable, trustworthy miners that have been signalling SegWit all along.
Zero thanks are deserved by Jihan and his NY"agreement", which was a face saving maneuver at best, and more realistically, just one more in a long line of hijacking attempts.
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:28:29
There is nothing positive to say about such agressive hijacking maneuvers.
This has been explained again and again on legitimate cryptocurrency forums all over the internet.
Here included, and to you specifically also.  Again, I respond just so others can clearly see what hostility, blatant propaganda, and outright lies Bitcoin has been subjected to at the hands of Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
Still you and yours insist on such dishonest questioning.


what do you think Jihan's 2x crap is about?  He's been pushing for a raw max block size Hard Fork for the last year or so at least. Has been denied again, and again, for damn good reason.


Take your sorry disinformation back to /btc where it belongs.   This is not the place for it.
We can trust reputable miners.  The snake oil salesmen such as Jihan are being dealt with.
The mere threat of a UASF caused him to make up this rediculous NY"A" lie,  and signal SegWit, as they should have LONG AGO.
going to 2mb max block size, and much further, as Jihan &amp; Co plan and would LOVE to do,
has EVERYTHING to do with a 51% attack.  This is why his latest hijacking maneuver (2x) is DOA.
Such must be guarded against with extreme prejudice.  The constant and blatant disinformation you and yours are pushing is nothing but more spam from him and his.  Give it up. Jihan has.


*Bandwidth. A raw block size increase will increase bandwidth needs, pushing smaller mining concerns even further out of the picture, and making it even more difficult to run full nodes.*
As is clearly to be read in my last response.
Now get gone with your propaganda.  People here do know what's up, and you've been tagged before for posing such dishonest questions, and regurgitating a spew of /btc disinformation.
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:46:47
Nice opportunity to pick up some cheap coins before it goes back up.
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:24:21


These are in no way comparable.
Bitcoin is bitcoin.
BU is a useless pile of bugs made as a hijacking attempt.  Nobody actually wants that garbage, except for the snake oil salesman Ver and his buddy Jihan that were pushing it.
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:28:23
Their word to who?  A bunch of shady gangsters making "agreements" to nobody but themselves.
Let them signal SegWit, as they should have LONG ago.
The ridiculous 2x crap is a fantasy though. Zero chance.
@_date: 2017-07-03 06:13:07
The only people that downtalk the Bitcoin devs are either paid by gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, or have been duped by their disinformation campaigns. 
Actual crypto experts, as well as true Bitcoin supporters are fully with the very large and knowledgeable Bitcoin dev team.
Their roadmap for SegWit, and beyond, has overwhelming support, no matter what garbage cesspools of disinformation forums like /btc spew.
Everything promoted by Jihan, Ver &amp; Co is demonstrably *bad for Bitcoin*.  There is no debate on this, only documented fact.
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:44:36
There is no debate,  and the crypto community isn't attacking anyone, let alone each other.
There are yet more aggressive hijacking maneuvers going on from Jihan and his goons, but they cannot be called part of the community whatsoever. They are working directly against Bitcoin, Crypto, and Open Source.
This latest 2x scam is just another desperate power grab, like they've been denied again and again.
Let them signal SegWit, but their 2x silliness is only a fantasy.
BTC = $5K in 5 years is a very easy bet btw.  Even with the constant attacks from Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:15:44
The info is correct. Jihan can't even plan a hostile takeover correctly.
His 2x fantasy was DOA.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:52:06
Once SegWit is locked in, then we can celebrate.
And then the rest of Jihan's 2x crap can be safely ignored.
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:53:35
Bigger blocks are the fastest and easiest way to give unscrupulous miners like Jihan &amp; Co. complete control over bitcoin.
Ain't gonna happen.
SegWit is the safe, easy, and only *actual* solution available.
First SegWit, then we can move forward with further scaling strategies.  
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:29:15


[This was very easy to find.](
TL;DR:  Exchanges will not deal with a contentious hard fork (scams like Unlimited, same as Jihan's proposed BCC) without strong proof that it is safe.
Jihan can provide none.  hell, the handful of devs he has under his thumb don't even know how to increase max block size, their main objective (Some misguided Bitcoin dev pointed out that fatal flaw to them), let alone assure replay protection!
There can be no such thing in their scams, as they have only an interest in complete takeover, not in any type of legitimate business, or interest in Bitcoin holders / dealers's safety.
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:55:21
What HF?
Once SegWit activates, there is no reason to discuss any hard fork.
Well, possibly, way down the road, but there are many more options to explore first.
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:28:43
No, that is NOT what they are doing.
In Open Source, the *source code* is free to use to start your OWN project.  Legitimate competition is fully encouraged.
What is not, is attempting to hijack the *resources* of the parent project for your own greedy gain.  This is what Ver, Jihan and their goons have attempted again and again. And been denied, again and again.
The resources of an Open Source project belong to it alone. This includes name, and in the case of Bitcoin, its blockchain.
Such shady hijacking maneuvers (btc1, 2x, ABC, BCC, XT, Classic, Unlimited, etc...) are discouraged in all of Open Source, with extreme prejudice, for damn good reason.
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:23:50
Oh you again.  You know full well how dangerous willy-nilly increasing max block size is, and why. Your question is not honest,
but I'll give an honest answer, as so many have before, for anyone else reading this.
Bandwidth.  A raw block size increase will increase bandwidth needs, pushing smaller mining concerns even further out of the picture, and making it even more difficult to run full nodes.
It can be argued that our current 1mb max block size is already too large.  
The LAST thing bitcoin needs is to hand over even more power to unscrupulous mining outfits owned or controlled by Jihan &amp; Co. that have free energy from their government (and who knows what else).
Honestly curious people need to look up what a threat the dreaded 51% attack is.  
In the past, respectable mining outfits that have approached that deadly number have split apart, encouraging their miners to decentralize.
Bad Actors such as Jihan, and those he controls, are doing the exact opposite! Increasing the max block size, with zero protections in place, would only benefit them. This would be disastrous to bitcoin. Allowing it to be completely centralized and controlled by (possibly government controlled) mining conglomerates would kill anything good about Bitcoin.
We already have things like Visa and PayPal.  Bitcoin's decentralized nature is vital to its usefulness and longevity.
This very real danger FAR OUTWEIGHS any scaling benefits, especially when SegWit is about to activate!
With SegWit, we have a more efficient use of block size, without the extreme danger of even further mining power centralization, or difficulty in running full nodes.
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:35:49
"Colored" coins are worse than useless.
They are the bastard child of greed and distraction. They have no business in a truly free economy. Just a way for the current monetary model to ruin a good idea.
Bitcoin is all we need, without the shit-stains.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:38:57
BTC1 can be ignored. Only unscrupulous miners under Jihan's control would be silly enough to run anything from there.
After SegWit goes live, their entire 2x scam, and all the hijacking attempts before it, can be safely forgotten.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:54:43
A couple... and they explicitly said they were acting *independently*.
In no way did they speak for Bitcoin.
And yup, Jihan and his goons broke that deal with them in the first place.
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:23:06
who's the shill?  Unlimited and all of these scams have proven, again, and again, to be completely lacking in integrity, worth, or even a shred of competence.
Not that you care, but for anyone else with an honest curiosity,
here are some links about Ver &amp; Jihan's last hostile takeover attempt:
It has been known for a long time that this latest scam of Roger Ver's (xt, classic, now unlimited) have no technological value.
This latest attempt, Unlimited coin, is written by a handful of completely incompetent "devs", as has been abundantly demonstrated, again and again! The links below are *just a beginning*.
The Bitcoin Community is well aware, and nobody in their right mind will turn Bitcoin over to this snake oil salesman Ver and his ridiculously broken software teams. Not to mention the shady mining concerns (hello Jihan &amp; Co) that supported it before it became so blatantly obvious that it was Dead On Arrival.
Some background on the dangers of this Unlimited nonsense:
[These three well written articles by Aaron van Wirdum explain BU's 'Emergent Consensus' (spoiler alert - it's got issues)](
Even more damning, a complete rundown of the blatant, wilful scam that is Unlimited:
Thanks to for this excellent writeup, and plethora of linked sources:
[**The Astounding Incompetence, Negligence, and Dishonesty of the Bitcoin Unlimited Developers**](
As if that was not enough!  (thanks to for the excellent writeup and links.)
Add to this the [Damning evidence on how Bitcoin Unlimited pays shills.]( 
Roger Ver has no shred of integrity, honesty or trustworthiness in him. He and his cohorts such as Jihan &amp; Co are shunned with extreme prejudice by the Bitcoin and Crypto community, as well as Open Source in general, for for their destructive practices.
Just as his latest hijacking attempt, Unlimited is, Jihan's 2x hijack attempt is, 
as well as the cesspools of disinformation and propaganda they use to organize their paid brigading (hello /btc).
@_date: 2017-07-21 06:00:01
Oh god, what a load of crap.
You've been copypasting this paragraph for weeks now.  It still isn't true.
There was no "agreement", except Jihan and his goons and a few shady businesses agreeing with themselves.
None are to be trusted.  
Let Jihan go ahead and try a hard fork.  It will be the end of him and his hijacking attempts.  Why he hasn't tried it until now.
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:30:01
oh the irony... calling this crap a "consensus".  
Jihan &amp; Co. are getting *very* desperate. You can almost smell the fear.
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:08:38
What is ridiculous is,  calling the hostile takeover attempts of unscrupulous mining concern's under Jihan's thumb, and Roger Ver's hijacking attempts, over the last three years,  "infighting".
These two bad actors have nothing to do with the Bitcoin community, devs, or legitimate miners, 
except they are constantly staging attacks on the Bitcoin project.
There is no debate, just a slew of such propaganda and disinformation, that you and your cronies are repeating here.
We've heard it all, again and again, far too long.
With all the anti-bitcoin spam you just posted, you are in no way "into bitcoin" except to try to destroy it, like the snake oil salesmen you are supporting with such nonsense. 
It is impossible to believe you have been here longer than me, and still have so little respect for Open Source, Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin,  unless you've spent that time actively attacking them, as you are now.
Take your own advice. ;)
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:32:49
SegWit, and all the SAFE and sane scaling strategies it opens the door for,
is infinitely better than turning over complete control to gangsters like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.  With their handful of incompetent devs, fully under their control.
Also, lightning is FAR from "unproven".  Have you ever taken a look at the code or community developing it?  Obviously not.
Nobody in their right mind will trust their wealth to shady bad actors such as the group of unscrupulous miners under Jihan's thumb, and his his handful of incompetent devs, also completely under his control,
unless they're in on the scam.
@_date: 2016-07-07 13:35:47


I think you must learn to make yourself clear. Everything you said until now fully sounds like you want a block size increase RIGHT NOW, with no real thought behind the repercussions.
Calling staying with 1mb limit for now "arbitrary", or even "coincidental" (and how, prey tell does THAT make sense?) sounds like any modicum of reason or caution is completely irrelevant to you.
As I said, this ridiculous attitude can only hurt bitcoin.
So yah, IF you seriously didn't mean that, then seriously, you should just say what you mean instead of wasting everyone's time.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:17:53
They have a "right"??   
dude, they CAN try, but it is shady as fuck. Such slimeball behavior is fully discouraged in all of Open Source.  You just don't try to hijack another project's resources.
Incompetent, unscrupulous, untrustworthy.

@_date: 2016-07-05 09:03:09


Yes, there is. We've talked about it to no end (and a lot in this very thread even).
Reading comprehension is a key skill when learning about new things. Please show your honest interest by using yours.
What are your opinions?  On what do you base this "I don't think"?  How does that compare to those (much more knowledgeable) that do support being extremely careful with increasing block size limits?
You know, some small amount of research is needed. We're not here to hold your hand.  In some places on the internet, this is referred to as "RTFM".  
If you refuse to bring even the slightest intelligent conversation about the technology to support your opinion, then what are we to do but dismiss you as just another troll / spammer / shill?
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:40:34
You have as little understanding of Open Source as you do of crypto and Bitcoin.
The *source code* is open to use for your OWN project.  The parent project's *resources* are not.
Among Bitcoin resources Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are constanntly trying to hijack: The Bitcoin name and Bitcoin blockchain.
What we demand is that they cease and deist with all such shady takeover attempts. Get on board with Bitcoin...
or make an actual altcoin project:  Own name, own blockchain, as any project with a hope of legitimacy and trustworthiness does.
@_date: 2017-07-05 07:58:37
Willy-nilly increasing max block size will directly decrease competition between miners.
We already have disreputable mining concerns harming bitcoin with their greed (hello Jihan &amp; Co.).  This 2x scam is just the latest example of a power grab in their favor. An attack on Bitcion.
No, there is no way to trust miners to "do the right thing". This Pollyanna attitude is very dangerous.
@_date: 2017-07-20 07:43:48
True,  but there's more than one way to skin a snake.
Every attack Jihan and his goons aim at Bitcoin, only makes it stronger.
Such destructive Bad Actors are being dealt with, and will continue to be.
Come ONNNN SegWit!
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:19:13
2x is a scam by unscrupulous miners (hello Jihan). There is no NY anything, just them jerking each other off again. 
Such hijacking attempts have been denied again and again, for damn good reason. 
The OP comic is on point. We need SegWit, not a shady max block size increase (2x) pushed by scam artists. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:57:18
LOL   who in their right mind is going to run buggy code, by a handful of devs, that are under Jihan's control?
Nobody.  btc1 is a pipe dream.  
btw, if your node is ready, where did you get the binaries? Wasn't aware there even was anything working.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:34:21
Once SegWit locks in, none of the other stuff will matter anymore.
Jihan can stick his 2x scam where the sun don't shine,
and the threat of the UASF will have fulfilled its mission.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:12:52
That is in no way how open source works. 
The source code can be freely copied and modified for your own project. 
The resources of the parent project are off limits. This includes name, and in this case blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:00:58
The comic is criticizing Jihan's 2x scam, not SegWit. 
SegWit will happen anyway, without 2x power grabs from snake oil salesmen. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:27:41
Maybe not "unlawful",  just shady af.
If they wanted to be seen as having any shred of integrity, the'd make a legit altcoin.  Own name, own blockchain.  Such competition is fully encouraged.
What they're doing is hijacking the resources of an already established project.  Despicable business right there.

None of those points have anything to do with reality in the least.
Just stop now, we've had way too much of this ridiculous spam.
There will be no hard-fork. Time you people come to grips with the fact that your game has been exposed for the blatantly destructive get-rich-quick scam that it is.
Any actual issues are already being adressed very well. Nobody in their right mind is willing to turn bitcoin development over to a tiny dev team of dissenters (and their corporate backers)
Never was going to happen. Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2016-07-31 19:35:12
Who are these "practically nobody" and "people" you're on about?
They do not exist, because that never happened.
Any *serious* concerns about scale-out are being handled very well, WITHOUT turning over bitcoin development to some tiny dev team.  There was never ever any chance of that happening.
Miners are not the biggest issue here. Miners are there to service bitcoin, not the other way around. If we do only what *miners* want, bitcoin dies.  
There are already powerful players that would love to destroy or co-opt bitcoin. Letting any one party control a majority of mining power is far too great a risk. This is very well known, and has always been.
There are no better proposals than what the bitcoin dev team is doing. If there were, they would have been integrated already.  
Bitcoin is doing just fine.

Such concerns are being addressed in a safe and sane way.
The propaganda and blatant misinformation of those supporting an instant max block size increase, with zero consideration for the risks, can be seen as nothing but destructive.
They originate with those know full well better, encouraging such ridiculous ideas for their own profit. Sadly, they are sometimes actually believed by the less knowledgeable too. :( "Useful Idiots" is maybe harsh, but it is also apt. 
There never was such a huge problem, there are no "factions" or questions of "consensus" at all. Never were.  
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2016-07-30 12:16:04
Sorry, your problem is, there are a LOT of people here that actually DO know exactly what is up.
Any of your "concerns" are being addressed already, and in a MUCH more sane way than turning over bitcoin development to a handful of derisive devs with huge corporate backing for disinformation and propaganda.
They would have us increase max block size with zero protections against further centralization. $$$$ for them, completely fucked up for actual bitcoin users and cryptocurrency enthusiasts.
There have never been any *serious* concerns. Stop that.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.  
@_date: 2016-07-21 07:49:41
Except the only end result is NO on that one.
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:25:52
Oh really now,  and out of which magic flying unicorn's ass did they pull THAT code?  Because they didn't have it last week. This means they are making HUGE changes to their production code, massivly important changes, at the very last second.
LOL  the code can hardly be called an alpha version, and they want to go live on Aug. 1st?  Completely untested mind you.
Ohhhh this is gonna be funny.
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:53:01
We already have far too much centralization as it is.
Jihan and his goons are able to hold back bitcoin progress, blocking SegWit.  
Giving them even *more* power would be the opposite of adding utility, it would be the end of bitcoin as we know it.
We need *safe* scaling solutions, like SegWit.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:36:04
Anti-scaling?  What part of SegWit do you understand as "anti-scaling".  
What you're supporting is Anti-Bitcoin; Turning over control oF to snake-oil salesmen like Jihan.  He and his goons have nothing whatsoever good in plan for Bitcoin, as they have shown again, and again.
Hong Kong... Also just a bunch of unscrupulous miners "agreeing" with themselves.  And a shit load of propaganda trying to make it look something like legitimate.
They have been denied such hijacking attempts again, and again, and will continue to be.
And bitcoin will be going ahead with SAFE and sane scaling, thanks to SegWit and Co.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:53:30
haha..   the HK "agreement" was nothing of the kind.
Just Jihan and a bunch of his goons agreeing with themselves.  It had nothing to do with Bitcoin at all, except as an attack on it.
Exactly like this latest NY "agreement", and the 2x scam. It means nothing. Just another hijacking attempt.
Ironically, Jihan &amp; Co are the ones that broke their silly HK"agreement" in the first place.
@_date: 2016-07-30 07:44:57


Except that /bitcoin actually does offer this.
That other cesspool of corporate disinformation, not at all.
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:38:20
No, some bitcoin miners (hello Jihan) are behaving like villains.  Their shady behavior has nothing to do with Bitcoin devs at all.
The devs have denied them their power grab and hijacking schemes, again and again, as it damn well should be.
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:39:13
The only FUD here are you anti-bitcion yahoos spreading Jihan's propaganda and disinformation.
We've seen this crap alllll too often before.  Take it back to /btc where it belongs.  Legitimate crypto forums (such as this one, and all over the web) are sick of such corporate spam &amp; brigading.
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:57:34
Bandwidth is the issue, not storage.  1mb max block size is arguably too large already.  We need SegWit, and the more efficient use of blocks it comes with. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 02:04:04
Who you are is irrelevant. What you're saying is.
The only thing that has been confirmed here is your complete lack of interest in a serious conversation.
So long.
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:21:54
None of you are offering anything like legitimate conversation,
just more anti-bitcioin propaganda and disinformation.
We've seen such attacks ALL too often here, and other legitimate crypto forums. 
Take it back to /btc where Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.'s scams are promoted. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:23:13
"claim"?  LOL
The only ones blocking SegWit are unscrupulous miners under Jihan's thumb.  
The vast majority of mining outfits are either fully for SegWit, or basically staying neutral.
Such a demnad for "evidence", says you either have no idea what's been going on,
or support Jihan's hijacking attempts.
Let's hope the former.
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:39:13
Centralization in Concurrency refers to mining power, not anything about the code.
The analogy is very good.  Willy nilly increasing max block size would be disastrous for Bitcoin.  We need *safe* scaling methods.
SegWit is the way forward, an none of Jihan's 2x scam either.
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:27:21

I, as any legitimate Cryptocurrency advocate would, strongly advise you to not invest too heavily (indeed at all) in the scams promoted there.
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:29:42
Comparing Eth to bitcoin?  Seriously?  There is no comparison. The only thing they have in common is they can both be called cryptocurrencies. They are built and handled very differently.
The Bitcoin community, legitimate miners, and anyone with even rudimentary knowedge of how Bitcoin works knows that decentralization is KEY to Bitcoin's safety, longevity and usefulness.
What Jihan wants is a fully centralized payment system like paypal, credit cards or such, fully under his greedy thumb. This is why his "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda is so looked down on, and why such hijacking attempts have been denied him and his goons again and again.
It has zero to do with anger, though such ridiculous schemes are fully deserving of being mocked. 
What Jihan and his troop of gangsters should have done LONG ago, (besides signalling SegWit) is making a *legitimate* alt-coin, instead of constantly trying to hijack an already established Open Source project (Bitcoin).
You see, the *source* is free to copy, for your *own* project, but the resources of the mother project belong to it alone. This includes name, and in this case, blockchain.
Bad actors such as Ver, Jihan, and their cronies have show their extreme disrespect for open source, crypto, and specifically Bitcoin, again and again.  If you insist on spamming their disinformation and propaganda, don't expect it to be welcome.
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:58:44
They really need to lay off with this ridiculous "artificial" now.
There are damn good reasons for having a 1mb limit. Networks even struggle with that as it is.
If there are any serious concerns about scaling, the large and knowledgeable bitcoin dev team are already working on them.
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:50:19
Hardware is a concern, but the bandwidth bottleneck is far moreso.
It is the real reason why a raw max block size increase is dangerous.
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:47:47
BCH is not a "team", it is a hostile takeover attempt. A scam. 
One in a long line for Ver &amp; Co. Zero legitimacy. 
It is not a fork, it is not a legit altcoin (that would be welcome!)
It is yet another attack on an already established Open Source project.
Such is discouraged with extreme prejudice in all of Open Source, not just cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2016-07-30 07:31:53
There is no real comparison.  This is a serious bitcoin sub.
/btc is a cesspool of corporate backed scam artists.
@_date: 2016-07-06 12:39:07
SIGH.  Once again disappointment. 
When are you people going to learn?
This get-rich-quick scheme of instantly upping blocksize with no protections... 
NOBODY that actually believes in bitcoin wants that.
@_date: 2017-07-25 08:21:15
2x nonsense is just another in a LONG line of aggressive hijacking attempts.
Jihan &amp; Co decided to shape up and FINALLY signal SegWit, because of the threat of being shipped out completely by a UASF.
Their motives are in no way legitimate support, as further hijacking efforts such as BCC clearly prove.
Again, if they had any shred of integrity, they'd offer TRUE competition, in the spirit of Open Source, with a legitimate alt coin.  If it was worthy, people would use it.
They have neither the interest, nor the capability of doing any such thing. Just more hijacking attempts.
And a ton more spam and disinformation such as you n your colleagues are spewing here.
Not one shred of legitimate critique among you, just tons of anti-Bitcoin shit slinging, as has soooo often been seen in such brigades.
Take it back to /btc where it's welcome.  
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:02:46
There are miners that act responsibly and with integrity, for the benefit of Bitcoin. We need more of them!
It is Jihan and those under his thumb that are disreputable, abusive and looking to aggressively hijack Bitcoin. They can, indeed, get fucked.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:56:30
Not out of the woods yet.  
How many blocks to go until SegWit is locked in permanently? 
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:43:03
"May"?   
There's no question.
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:34:43
There really is no debate.  Just a lot of money being spent on propaganda and blatant disinformation.
Optimizing how we use the blocksize limits we have now is infinitely wiser than what the "increase now!" crowd propose.
Increase in block size benefits large mining farms, and will further promote even more centralization. We must avoid letting anywhere near 51% of mining power fall into the hands of any one agent or conglomerate.
Just willy-nilly increasing block size with no hardcore protections in place against further centralization is insanity.
@_date: 2017-07-05 07:53:52
There is zero reason to look at any code behind this 2x crap. It is simply Jihan's latest power grab.
He can go right ahead and signal SegWit, as he should have all along,
but him and his goons have been denied a raw max block size increase, again and again, for damn good reason.
Not gonna happen.
@_date: 2016-07-08 19:52:55
Really now?
The things I'm saying about bitcoin *actually make sense*,
so no, that was just for you Mr Hateur.  
There is zero chance that any fly by night get rich quick scam artist are going to bamboozle the entire bitcoin world into hard forking a huge increase in block size limits.
They have no protections in mind. It is purely for a quick buck.
We need to be slow and steady with the road map. The devs are doing a great job. 
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:02:09
Especially ones with absolutely zero chance of winning the election.

That graphic has nothing to do with bitcoin.org.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:23:07
The immediate 2mb raw max block size increase is a complete and total no-go.
Not gonna happen.  Nobody that knows the first thing about cryptocurrency wants to give even more power to destructive players like Jihan's disreputable mining conglomerate.
SegWit or StatusQuo.  
Then again, there are other ways to skin a snake. Jihan better be paying attention, because people are talking about forcing SegWit around his blocking attempts.
@_date: 2016-07-30 11:49:04
There's actually a lot more realistic arguments about 9/11 being an inside job than the spam and corporate propaganda that inundates serious bitcoin forums lately supporting willy-nilly increasing max block size.
The former is at least done with good will, the latter, so obviously paid astroturfing.
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:39:14
What the hell are they talking about? 
SegWit, the only serious part, is fully ready to go, and has been for quite a while.
Are they seriously considering the 2x scam Jihan is so desperately trying to push through?  lol
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:21:18
2x is completely a Jihan pet project.  wtf are you on about man?
The entire NY"agreement" scam, as well as the identical HK"agreement" scam before it,
were nothing more than him, his goons and cronies "agreeing" with *themselves*.  Had nothing to do with Bitcoin.
You fully support Jihan &amp; Co's hijacking attempts.  That is very clear.
There is no possibility of a "civil discussion" with gangsters such as Jihan and his unscrupulous mining concerns.
The dev team, trustworthy miners, Bitcoin communtiy has tried and tried.
All that worked was the threat of a UASF.  He had no choice but to comply with what is actually good for Bitcoin, stop abusively blocking progress.
And he and his goons are now proving, once again, that their motives are completely corrupt, with yet more plans for aggressive hijacking attempts.
He has zero claim to the Bitcoin name or blockchain. Calling any of his scams "Bitcoin", planning to use the Bitcoin blockchain for his own project,  is all the exact opposite of what a legitimate Open Source project is about.
He is in no way making an altcoin.  Such would actually be encouraged.  A "hard fork" of an existing project is not an altcoin. When done by complete outsiders it is noting other than a hostile takeover attempt.
Only the Bitcoin project itself can create a legitimate hard fork.  When and if it is time.
Until then, Jihan had better shape up. He's only digging the hole deeper. They have been denied such a hostile takeover again and again, and will continue to be denied.
Now, stop the anti-Bitcoin spam.  It has been seen all too much, and is much too easy to spot.
Take it back to /btc and other such cesspools of disinformation where scams such as btc1, 2x, ABC, BCC, XT, Classic, Unlimited, etc... are promoted. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:08:32
This is Jihan's (an unscrupulous miner that has been trying to hijack bitcoin for months) latest lame attempt to attach a dangerous max block size Hard Fork to the overwhelmingly popular SegWit.
SegWit will to through, which is awesome. Jihan and his goons should have signaled it LONG AGO,
But Jihan's 2x power grab... that he has been denied agian and again,
LOL, not a chance.
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:59:00
Nothing of worth has ever come from that scam.
Hell, the idiots Ver can get to work for him couldn't figure out how to increase block size!  The very main talking point behind the whole scam.
One of the Bitcoin devs had to step in and show them, before they royally fucked up and spammed up the Bitcoin blockchain even worse than they do now.
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:10:42


And much much lower quality. :(
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:53:24
They have day jobs.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:27:56
Sounds to me like they'll be spamming up the bitcoin blockchain with unrelated info.
In any case, MS getting interested is only a threat.
They can go make their own blockchain. They don't need to co-opt an already successful product.
Of course, that's their M.O.  This is not good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-04 16:01:31
These are all very good questions, that only you can answer.
Anyone else would say "because you obviously don't care".
Please go back to /btc now.
@_date: 2016-07-30 07:30:22
This is a very accurate description of not only /btc, but many other parties backed by corporate funding aimed at hijacking or destroying bitcoin. 
We see their spam not only here, but on other serious bitcoin forums. It is good to see that real bitcoin advocates are aware of this threat.
I do not agree with your edit though. That place is a lost cause, and I mistrust any mod claiming they are attempting to do any good there. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 01:18:24
This is only for lightning network, so it's pretty much irrelevant.
No affect on actual bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-30 07:38:00
/btc is an option?  yah right, have you read that garbage?
Astroturfing, blatant misinformation and shilling galore. There is hardly anything but.
Better there than in serious bitcoin forums. The mods here have done a good job against their spam.
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:42:44
Yah, Ver &amp; Co are "serious" about their bitcion.COM scam site too. :-/
Fortunately, it is well known in the crypto community as just that too: total scam site. This new .com site of Jihan's will be held in equal disdain.
Such hostile takeover attempts are discouraged with extreme prejudice not only in crypto, but in the larger Open Source community, and for damn good reason.
Anyone can use an Open Source project's *source code* to start their own project. Competition is fully good and encouraged!   What is NOT ok is attempting to hijack the mother project's resources.
This includes name, and in this case blockchain.   For those not in the know:
The Bitcoin project has one git repository. The Bitcion blockchain belongs to that project alone. Their official website is bitcion.ORG  There are some fully compatible projects such as bona fide Bitcion wallets that are promoted there.
Bad actors such as Ver, Jihan &amp; Co prove they have no integrity, or legitimacy for trying to steal any Bitcion resources. If they have any wish to be seen as legitimate, they would start their own altcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-08 18:40:09
You mean Open Source, not decentralization. 
In the context of cryptocurrency, decentralization referrs to mining power. 
Otherwise, fully agreed.  We'd just make another coin. 
@_date: 2016-07-30 06:40:32
Indeed, good moderation. Keeping spam from destructive get-rich-quick scam artists (no matter how much financing they have for their propaganda) off this serious bitcoin forum is a very good thing.
Anti-spam measures have nothing to do with censorship. The amount of disinformation, blatant propaganda and political derailing often includes downright abusive trolling. Good riddance to the people (paid or not) that employ such destructive tactics.
Back to /btc with them where they belong.
@_date: 2016-07-05 08:55:12
Arbitrary: "subject to individual will or judgment without restriction; contingent solely upon one's discretion."
No, that does not fit at all either, as has been explained already again and again.  There are very good reasons to be very careful increasing block size limits. 
No protections in place and everyone jumping to even 2MB blocks would be a disaster.
@_date: 2016-07-30 13:56:20
There was never any derisiveness against *serious* concerns.  In fact, the large and knowledgeable bitcoin dev team has often been highlighted here addressing exactly the err.. "concerns" around scaleout. 
Consistently, and constantly, they are working on this and many other ideas.  
There simply is no DOOM! situation as some would want us to believe.  
Just before I read someone *seriously* saying that bitcoin will fail in the very near future if we do not immediately increase max block size. As if anyone that has any rudimentary knowledge would believe that. It is pure disinformation aimed at people just learning. :(  this is pure evil.
This level of misinformation, and how often it is repeated, with zero, absolutely no base in reality, is the problem.
A concern can be brought to the table, but spamming constant disinformation, and brutal abuse, downright shit-slinging that such "concerns" so, so often turn into after a few exchanges, is not discussion.
The latter is what we've seen so much of lately, and the devs are dealing with it as best  they can. Here, and other bitcoin forums. The *serious* discussion of bitcoin has suffered very little, thanks to them, against the onslaught of destructive influences.
Security is coming from keeping one party from amassing too much mining power.  There never was any harassment from this sub.
On the contrary, this sub, and many other legitimate *serious* bitcoin forums have been inundated recently with a tsunami of harassment. Shills, propaganda, disinformation, as said, downright shit slinging.
Bitcoin might have been doing marginally better without this terrorism from get-rich-quick scam artists, but really, they are of little consequence.
It has become clear to the masses what is REALLY going on, as it has been for all informed cryptocurrency users. The abusive spam from the likes of these get-rich-quick scam artitst are held in extreme prejudice, for damn good reason.
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:17:02

@_date: 2016-07-30 07:25:23
There is a difference between squelching the blatant spam and brigading /btc and the scam artists behind it are guilty of, and censorship.  
uses anti-spam measures, and very fairly, (to a fault in fact I'd say, I think useless threads such as this one should be deleted on sight.)
What /btc does is blatantly censor anything that does not align with their ridiculous corporate hijacking attempts.
@_date: 2016-07-31 19:38:41
total bullshit dude.  Thy have been, and are, being addressed just fine.
Your scenario in support of larger block size is directly supporting SMALLER block size.
Really, that is a large problem already. Our max block size limit is too BIG, not too small.
Please stop now, you're not selling any snake oil here.
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:43:05
A hard fork simply to increase block size would be insanity.
Without very good protections in place against further centralization of mining power, it would be extremely dangerous for bitcoin.
Ain't gonna happen. Never was either, no matter how much money certain parties pay for shilling  and astroturfing. 
Too many intelligent people know what's really up. The blatant propaganda is called out on a regular basis (and we're all pretty tired of it now).  Their ship has sunk.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2016-07-30 07:40:46
Anti-spam measures != censorship.

@_date: 2016-07-31 19:30:12
You didn't see anything.  Just stop now, you're wasting all our time
(and maybe your employer's money?)
Nobody is reading this deep in the thread anymore, not your target audience anyway, and you're not selling me, or anyone halfway knowledgeable about cryptocurrency, any of your snake oil.
Whatever needs to be done in connection with scale out is being handled very well. It is NO WHERE NEAR as "important" as so much propaganda and spam wants newbies to believe.
There is no evidence of imminent danger whatsoever. There is zero need for any *more* proof of this, it is already fully, abundantly clear. Bitcoin is growing, becoming more popular.
There is zero proof of any, whatsoever, large problems with the blocksize as it is.  Concerns that there might be are already being handeled in the best ways by the large and knowedgable bitcoin dev team.
Your behavior looks a lot like corporate shilling, disinformation and propaganda, as I see it.  Just like so much hoopla we've experienced here lately.
Exactly what project do you support to fix this supposed "problem" you are so sure exists?  THAT is the real question.
That is, actually, the *only* serious question.  This discussion starts, and ends, exactly there.
@_date: 2016-07-29 17:33:34
Zero details. This mean nothing. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:55:23
It is irrelevant, because nobody in their right mind is going for a raw max block size increase.  
This x2 nonsense is just another hijacking attempt by Jihan &amp; Co.  Not gonna happen.
@_date: 2016-07-30 07:11:49
The people "taking positions" have large corporate backing from large players that would like nothing more than to dismantle or hijack bitcon's well established infrastructure.
There never was a question of "consensus", despite all the corporate backed propaganda that is spammed in bitcoin forums lately. 
This is nothing but spam, and fully deserves to be run out (on a rail) of any serious bitcoin forum. The mods here have done well, all things considered.
There are no actual "factions", this is just more hoopla designed to benefit get-rich-quick scam artists.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:19:15
No there isn't.  The propaganda and disinformation, shady hijacking attempts of Bitcoin's resources, comes exclusively from such scam artists like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
There is nothing to propagandize about them, they are bad enough on their own.
There are no "two sides" at all. There is Bitcoin, and there are shady gangsters attacking it.  That is not any kind of debate.
People running, and supporting scams such as XT, Classic, Ultimate, btc1, 2x, BCC, etc...  are not any part of the Bitcoin community. They are directly attacking it, and have no legitimate "side" to offer.
@_date: 2016-07-05 08:50:00
Demanding a full course on the workings of bitcoin with zero effort on your own to even attempt to learn...
This is an attitude that is either completely dishonest, or incredibly lazy.
With silly shaming attempts attached as they are, I can only assume just more of the former.  We've had enough shit-talkers around here lately.
You DEMAND knowledge?  Help yourself. Come back and at least TRY to have an intelligent conversation.
Such disrespect only will get you the same.
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:35:22
Even if a raw max block size increase was "simpler",
does not mean it is not extremely dangerous.
*Last* thing we need is giving hijackers like Jihan &amp; Co even *more* power.  
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:50:40
Larger blocks make it harder for smaller mining outfits to compete.
This makes it easier for already dangerously powerful mining outfits to grab even more control.
Jihan and his goons have so much mining centralization, they are blocking Bitcoin progress.
Giving them even more with a raw Max Block Size increase would be insane.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:53:58
And again, the last resort, 
as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's desperate attempts at yet another hijacking manouver are shot down...
the last resort is outright, mindless (and ineffectual) shit-slinging.
We've seen this all too often.  It is getting VERY easy to spot the pattern.
@_date: 2016-07-30 07:35:09

Bitcoin devs are giving the community what they want.  SegWit is ready to roll out.
Unscrupulous mining concerns like Jihan &amp; Co. are blocking it.
Denying such scam artists the raw max block size increase they so desperately want (2x) is also delivering what the Bitcoin community wants. 
SegWit will activate, with none of this shady 2x nonsense. That is what Bitcoin needs and wants, and what Bitcoin devs are delivering.
@_date: 2016-07-30 07:33:20

@_date: 2016-07-30 07:15:07
Indeed, all the propaganda, disinformation and spam we have to suffer from these fly-by-nighght startups is disgusting.
They all need their own damn blockchains, and forums. Alcoins are good. If they had any actual points, the respectable thing to do would be PROVE IT...
If one of them came up with something better than bitcoin, I'd use it,  but none of them has. Quite the opposite.
@_date: 2016-07-21 07:54:31
Yes, people do call it block chain. 
In fact, "blockchain" is frowned upon in more serious circles, for a few good reasons.

Jihan and his band of highwaymen are the ones not supporting SegWit. 
The cryptocurrency community, Bticoin experts in specific, are fully for it.
@_date: 2016-07-30 11:53:09
Exactly what are you saying?  For or against an instant hard-fork to increase max block size?  
Impossible to follow your logic unless you say it explicitly. 
(This kind of ambiguity is a known tactic used by destructive agents to derail conversations.)
The dev team is dealing with any scaling issues. Carefully, sanely. The corporate propaganda screaming for instant blocksize increase is just that, ridiculous propaganda.
Being clear about it like that leaves no doubt.
Yah, and also, this forum is constantly brigaded by shills, astroturfers and sock-puppet voting paid for by the corporate backers working against, or trying to take over bitcoin.
There is no actual danger, zero DOOM, as they would love for people to believe.

The dislike of Roger Ver is fully reasonable, based on the complete lack of merit he consistently demonstrates.
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:16:47
this 2x shit is in no way a compromise.  It is just another push for a max block size increase.
Actual SegWit will be activated, but without the dangers of the block size HFork silliness.  
There is no way to "compromise" with destructive hijackers like Jihan &amp; Co.  They must be denied completely or we put Bitcoin in their hands.  That     would be the end of it completely.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:09:47
No, because there's no way in hell that Jihan's 2x scam will work.
Nobody is going to run buggy software, from a handful of devs, completely under Jihan's control.
If he actually tries a HF, his coin will be worthless pretty much instantly. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:34:21
/btc propaganda and shit slinging is even worse than /ethtrader.
@_date: 2016-07-04 00:01:55
Rodger.  Ok, just pointing out that a Hard Fork would be pretty insane, even though some corrupt projects are pushing hard for it.
Fully agree with your logic and knowledge. Keep on laying down the truth here man. People just learning about bitcoin can so easily be confused by all the blatant shilling that goes on. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:23:18
That link leads to an article, that leads back to the new scammer site bitcoincash.org  
Where they say: Bitcoin transactions containing a special OP_RETURN value.  
This value is optional.  There is no legitimate playback protection in BCC. Unless they've revamped their code in the last day or so.  lol
Amazing these yahoos think anyone is actually going to use, let alone trade their crap.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:46:23
Increasing the block size to even 2mb would push small miners even further off the map.  This would give even more power to shady corporations under Jihan's greedy thumb.
This is a very well known dynamic, and protecting Bitcoin (and crypto in general) 
against such enormous threats is a huge concern when considering scaling strategies.
That is why SegWit is wanted by Bitcoin experts, and the community,
and why shady outfits such as Jihan's are discouraged with extreme prejudice.
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:46:30


They are working directly against the Bitcoin community, cryptocurrency and open source. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:15:06
Nobody of any importance "agreed" to anyting.
I can write out a letter stating that you now owe me your firstborn, have some other shady characters sign it...
It does not mean it is any kind of "agreement".  
No, all that little meeting was is a farce, a stalling tactic, and further hijacking maneuver. 
The Bitcoin community and experts, agree that a raw max block size increase is a ridiculously dangerous idea, 
and that safe and sane scaling, such as SegWit brings, is the way forward.
@_date: 2018-12-13 01:54:40
One of the very best benefits of Bitcoin, and any secure cryptocurrency, is the ability to circumvent corrupt governments and their puppet masters. This isn't going anywhere, if anything, there is more and more need.
Governments are known to shut down banks and steal money. This is where Cryptocurrency shines.
AND, even for your daily coffee, there is SegWit and Lightning now.
But, the real advantage of Bitcoin, is being in control of your own wealth.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:19:36
no, the unscrupulous mining outfits you're promoting (hello Jihan &amp; Co) answer to the Bitcoin community. 
This latest 2x scam they're so desperately pushing is because they fear being called to answer with a UASF. And they should be afraid.
Either way it doesn't matter. Through all of their attacks, Bitcoin is doing just fine. Our large and incredibly knowledgeable dev team has resisted any hijacking attempts.
Jihan &amp; Co. will be denied this latest power grab, as they have been so often in the past.
@_date: 2017-07-19 10:23:02
You Mr. Loko, have, even as an outsider, completely seen through and effortlessly dismantled the ridiculous disinformation attempts that supporters of the scam artists Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. use.
They have zero logical, technological arguments to offer, just a constant slew of ineffectual shaming attempts.
Such "conversations" always degrade into just that, if not worse. Often downright shit-slinging is their last resort.
Even if you may not know much about bitcoin, crypto, or even open source, your logic is extremely valuable.
Please, Mr. Loko, feel free to carry on. (now tagged and approved as Pro-Bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:12:20
Nor will they.  There will be no raw max block size increase, for damn good reason.
This x2 garbage is just another hijacking attempt by Jihnan &amp; Co. :(
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:51:56
No way in hell that will happen.
A raw max block size increase has been denied these snake oil salesmen (hello Jihan, Ver &amp; Co) again, and again,
for damn good reason.
@_date: 2017-07-05 11:14:07


That this 2x scam is merely another power grab attempt by gansters such as Jihan and his shady goons. Unscrupulous mining interests only out for their own good, making (yet another) attack.
They have been denied a raw max block size increase again and again, for damn good reason. They only want it because they know it would give them an advantage, and push smaller mining concerns even farther out of the picture.
Not gonna happen.
Let them signal *actual* SegWit, but their 2x HFork silliness is complete folly.
@_date: 2016-07-05 08:58:01
How I appear to you is completely irrelevant. 
Telling me I'm arrogant, and then dictating to me what "friendly" would be... funny.
Why don't you do the tiniest bit of research, learn a little, then come back and actually have a try at an intelligent conversation.
As it is, with this vaguely aggressive attitude, combined with obvious ignorance on the subject... Looks just like more propaganda, FUD and distraction. Stop that.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:29:58


is exactly that chaos you're talking about.
It is simply the latest in a long line of hijacking maneuvers.  Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have been denied such power grabs all along.
There will be no max block size increase hard fork. Putting even more power into the hands of such snake oil salesmen would be insane.
SegWit will activate, without any 2x silliness. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 06:03:59
Many people are anyway, just to support Crypto and Bitcoin.
Even running a full node is a positive, personally (can actually verify transactions locally) as well as growing the network.
Come ONNNNN SegWit! :)
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:08:21
Nobody in their right mind is going to run software from a handful of incompetent "devs" under Jihan's control.
And there's no way he'll get this 2x scam integrated into Bitcion itself, so that's his only option.
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:46:15
Zero chance of this 2x max block size increase going through.
It has been denied again and again, for damn good reason.
No, SegWit will be activated, without the ludicrously dangerous HF block size crap. 
Nobody is falling for *your* FUD.   Go sell this 2x snake oil elsewhere. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:27:36
this 2x scam is absolutely the WRONG direction.
Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have been denied their raw max block size increase power grab again and again, for damn good reason.
This latest 2x scam will get them no closer to the total hijacking of Bitcoin they're aiming for.  Nobody in their right mind is going to run software written by them.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:48:22
This mindless and ineffectual shaming attempt is so very typical of such disinformation brigades.
When such scams as this latest 2x are debunked, again and again, the last resort Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have is outright shit-slinging.
We, and so many other legitimate crypto forums have seen this behavior again, and again.
Thankfully, it's getting very easy to spot for exactly what it is; 
Mindless, ineffectual (very often paid) support for aggressive hijacking attempts.
No, there will be no raw max block size Hard Fork.
Go ahead Jihan, try it...  heh,  it will be the end of your hijacking maneuvers.  Why you haven't done so already.  
That dog has a loud bark, but he has no teeth.
Segwit will activate, or status quo,
or Jihan's nightmare... why he's pushing this 2x bullshit so hard now...  UASF will take effect.
In any case, through all these hostile hijacking attempts (lately 2x &amp; Unlimited),  the Bitcoin communtity stands strong,
and Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:37:57

What a load of hoopla.  This will get them nothing.
There is no actual "Agreement", just another hostile takeover attempt.  Jihan &amp; his goons desperately pushing, yet again, for a raw max block size increase.
This has nothing to do with bona fide SegWit whatsoever. Them using that name just shows how shady this crap is. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 07:33:12

the only ones he's friends with are other scam artists like Roger Ver. :(

This crap is a total scam. 
Nobody in their right mind is going to run software made by these 2x snake oil salesmen.  They couldn't even figure out how to do the 2mb increase!
Their ridiculous plan here has no business using the SegWit name, or Bitcoin for that matter.  
Bona fide SegWit will activate without any dangerous max block size hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:05:06
Yes, and add Jihan's latest 2x scam to the list of failed hijacking attempts. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:45:26
What FUD are you talking about?  
More nonsense about hard forks being easy to reverse... sure bud. This is an exercise in futility. It's not gonna happen, because it's an incredibly stupid idea.
Why the hell would anyone want to do something like that, except to gain an unfair advantage?  Upping max block size with no protections against shady mining corporations is, again, lunacy.
What the hell will you do with even 2mb blocks, when bitcoin falls completely under the control of such greedy sociopaths?  This is what you are speaking for. 
What possible benefit will that have, and how is it worse than just waiting for SegWit to activate?  
Status quo is far, far better than just willy-nilly increasing block size.
Oh yah, and how are people that most benefit from bitcoin,  namely, the ones in poorer conditions with no stable fiat, going to still use bitcoin when you up the blocks to outrageous proportions?  
You gonna pay for their countries to exponentially increase their bandwidth to keep up?  Complete fantasy, with zero logic behind it.  What benefit could it possibly bring to anyone?  More easily paying for coffee at your local starbucks?  
 What is your reasoning behind the insane idea of handing even more power over to the already too powerful mining conglomerations?
"No damage whatsoever" is just going on as things are now, until SegWit is activated.
This insane idea of a hard-fork to larger blocks, with some magical fantasy that it would cause no damage,
is utter nonsense.
Unless you can offer a concrete, logical reason otherwise (against the vast knowledge of actual cryptocurrency experts, mind you) then please stop wasting people's time with this ridiculous notion.
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:33:44
Zero need for any such conversations until SegWit is activated.
Or another *safe* means of scaling is written and tested (there are no others currently).
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:59:32
Irrelevant. 
There will be no max block size hard fork. 
The LAST thing bitcoin needs is putting even more power in the hands of shady people like Jihan and his goons.
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:36:01
Out of who's ass did you pull that number?
No, there will be no hard fork for a raw max block size increase.
The LAST thing we need now is to give scam artists like Jihan &amp; Ver even more power than they've already hijacked. 
SegWit first, then any other discussions.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:53:24
Please take this thinly vieled "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda back to /btc where it belongs.
There will be no raw max block size increase.
Giving Bitcoin's enemies (Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.) even more centralized mining power is the exact opposite of a solution.
Ain't gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:41:53
then signal SegWit and stop supporting scam artists like Jihan and Ver.
They are holding up the progress of bitcoin, that is more efficient use of block size, and all the of side channel goodness for your precious bubblegum &amp; softdrink purchases.
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:37:13
The snake oil salesmen pushig this 2x crap are just after a raw max block size increase.
It would allow them to centralize even more power.  THEY are who they are.  Bad actors such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, and the goons they control. 
They have been denied their power grabs again, and again, and this 2x crap will be no different.  Not gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:09:15

SegWit will be activated, without any of the dangers this 2x nonsense brings with it.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:25:01

Not gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:05:13
There will be no raw max block size increase.  Not in this newest scam effort "x2", and not alone.  
Such has never been on the table, because:
Crypto and Bitcoin experts know it is extremely dangerous to put even more power in the hands of our enemies (hello Jihan). Not gonana happen.  
And please, stop with your rediculous hard fork is better disinformation. People here actually do know what's up.
Go sell that snake oil on /btc , they love the shit.
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:19:31
There is no ~~devide~~ devide in the community at all.
The bitcoin community is for SegWit,
and some unscrupulous mining concerns (hello Jihan) want to hijack bitcoin, and are blocking SegWit.
Snake oil salesmen such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. are no part of the bitcoin community, they are attacking it.
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:03:01

@_date: 2017-07-23 07:46:53
The title suggests no such thing.  
Most likely it's because the unscrupulous mining concerns under Jihan's thumb have stopped spamming useless transactions. That has more to do with today's events than SegWit. 
SegWit hasn't even been activated (yet).
@_date: 2017-06-17 09:30:00

@_date: 2017-06-13 08:01:15
Awesome writeup. 
Just like to point out one error:


That toxicity lies squarely on the shoulders of scam artists such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
They are no part of the Bitcoin community, they are directly fighting against it.
Thankfully, even in the face of such hostile hijacking attempts, Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2019-05-07 13:07:37
In the little blerb describing the author, it says, 


Anyone using the term "decentralized" to describe software has historically been involved in scams such as Ver's long line of hostile takeover attempts.  
In the context of Bitcoin, "decentralized" is exclusively referring to mining power and node centralization. It has zero to do with software.
Possibly just unfortunate that decentralized and FOSS are placed in a row like that? Is this dude actually legit?
Don't know much else about this guy, but that is enough to stay frosty.
Taproot could be good for Bitcoin, especially for  large business deals. Privacy is a huge benefit.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:28:05
There's absolutely zero guarantee it ever would.  
All this x2 scam ensures is that shady characters like Jihan and his goons would get the raw max block size increase they've been pushing for.
This cannot be allowed to happen. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 07:42:53
Disreputable ones like Jihan &amp; Co are directly *against* the bitcoin and cryptocurrency community.
Reputable miners, big and small, are part of it.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:13:49
Unscrupulous mining concerns and other scam artists like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co want bigger blocks.
The actual bitcoin community wants SAFE and sane scaling solutions. SegWit provides that.
The raw max block size increase that the scam artists push for would only hurt bitcoin, giving bad actors even more mining power.  Not gonna happen.
SegWit or status quo.
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:57:28
There never was a "compromise".  Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are simply trying (yet again) to aggressively hijack the Bitcion project's resources for their own gain.
Jihan and his disreputable mining outfits have been blocking Bitcoin progress (SegWit) for months and months now.
The Bitcion community threatened to ship them out completely with a User Activeated Soft Fork (UASF), so they decided to shape up and start signalling for SegWit, as trustworthy mining outfits have all along.
Of course, being the shady charachters they are, they tried to combine thier compliance with another scam, 2x.  This is simply the raw max block size increase they've been denied again and again, for damn good reason.
Willy-nilly increasing block size like that would only give them more centralization of mining power. Not gonna happen.
Now they're trying for another hijacking maneuver, and the OP graphic is poking fun at their ridiculous attempts.
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:29:00
Jihan and his cronies are not comic book villains, they are real-life villains.
There is no way to paint them as anything but.  He has demonstrated, again and again, his complete and utter disdain for the Bitcoin community. 
The only "agreement" was made between unscrupulous mining concerns and other shady bad actors, for their own greedy profit, and directly *against* Bitcoin.
That has ZERO to do with the actual Bitcoin project, or its community, so no, there is zero agreement",
just another shady hijacking attempt.
*Actual consensus* is loud and clear: SegWit is the way forward, 
without any x2 bullshit, no raw max block size increase simply for the benefit of such hijackers such as Jihan &amp; Co.
SegWit has overwhelming support.  Jihan had better shape up, or he will be shipped out.
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:20:21
Unscrupulous miners that push for as much control as they can possibly get are to be discouraged with extreme prejudice. (hello Jihan &amp; Co.)
Them having power is nothing but bad at all. There are not "two sides" to this.  There is the good of shady mining concerns like Jihan's, and the good of Bitcoin.
One having power is completely good, the other having too much (greedy miners) would be the end of bitcoin.
That's why Jihan, Ver &amp; Co pay for so much disinformation and push hijackings attempts such as Unlimited, and this new 2x crap.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:13:38
Unscrupulous mining outfits like Jihan's, and the ones he controls, are based in China.  
It has to do with location and electricity cost,
it has zero to do with any of your pathetic "nationality" strawman. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:17:33
Why the hell would anyone want to "get compatible" with this x2 scam?
No, Jihan and his goons are the ones that need to shape up.  
There will be no raw max block size hard fork.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:11:47
Yup.  The entire bitcoin community has been ready to activate SegWit for months and months now.
It is being blocked by a few unscrupulous bad actors (hello Jihan) and their goons.  This 2x hijacking attempt is just more of their bullshit.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:07:13
Go ahead and support unscrupulous mining conglomerates that are directly attacking Bticoin if you wish, just don't expect any sympathy from actual Cryptocurrency supporters.
Jihan and his goons aren't going to HF, that would be the end of them. Their bark is bigger than their bite. If they were going to, I really wish they'd just get on with it so we could be rid of them for good.
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:18:44
SegWit is the very best thing, really, the *only* safe and sane scaling solution out there. 
It is a huge success in that the vast majority of crypto and bitcoin experts, and the Bitcoin community, 
are fully for it going into effect immediately.
The only thing holding it back are bad actors like Jihan and his band of highwaymen.
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:46:15
no, the x2 is no compromise, it is directly destructive to bitcoin.
SegWit itself needs to be activated asap, or nothing.
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:52:41
It is exactly the opposite.  Larger blocks means that fewer people can use bitcoin, not more.
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:19:47
Completely false.  
Unscrupulous mining concerns such as Jihan and his band of hijackers want a raw max block size increase.
Cryptocurrency experts and Bitcoin supporters know it would be insane to put even more power in their hands. Not gonna happen. 
SegWit is the way forward, without any 2mb nonsense attached.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:57:27
Yes, that is right,  Jihan and his goons can just go make their own altcoin, and leave Bitcoin the hell alone.
If they can do better, it will be used. Legitimate competition is very welcome.
The shady hijacking attempts he's so known for are the opposite.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:03:34
No, there is no grey area.  Bitmain is aggressively trying to hijack Bitcoin. 
They have no "side", because there is no debate.
There is only constant attacks from shady outfits like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's,
and Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Open Source's defense against them. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 15:26:07
Hard forks happen inside a project, not through hostile takeover attempts.
@_date: 2016-07-04 00:32:32
There are no "all sides".  Well, there is a lot of disinformation and propaganda, if you call that a "side".
This silliness has been debunked again and again these last months. I suggest you do some reading.
The threat of allowing any one entity or conglomerate to gain 51% of mining power is a very well-known threat. 
The dynamics of blockchain size and how it encourages such centralization has been discussed to no end here, and other bitcoin forums.
If you are actually serious, and not just wanting to spread more hoopla, there are PLENTY of facts and solid information. That you say you have found none is rather funny, and just makes it sound like you don't actually want to.
@_date: 2016-07-30 07:00:24
Any and all actual "issues" are already being handled by the very capable and knowledgeable bitcoin dev team. 
The problem is a few get-rich-quick scam artists that insist on constantly spamming serious bitcoin forums (not only here) with their ridiculous DOOM! propaganda.
Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:26:54
Amen. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 16:04:05
It is planned this way. Ever do any coding at all yourself?
It kinda helps to plan things, and think about consequences.
Actually, have you ever even used bitcoin?
The entire idea of "artificial" is completely artificial.
please stop spewing such nonsense. We're all really tired of it.
@_date: 2017-06-23 02:05:16
The community is not split, and there is no debate.
There are a few bad actors (hi Jihan) blocking Bitcoin progress.
The last thing Bitcoin needs is to give them even more power.  They've been denied their "Big Blocks NOW!" madness again, and again. 
There will be no max block size increase hard fork.
SegWit will activate, without any 2x scam.
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:57:52
An answer would not include the inevitable destruction of the thing with the problem.
No, more mining power centralization is no answer at all. Quite the opposite.
@_date: 2017-06-02 00:44:40
There is only SegWit.  no + anything.
It is incompatible with ASICBoost. That is why Jihan and his band of pirates are dead set against it.
Such destructive players as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are pushing for Big Blocks NOW!, as it will give them even further power.
Mining centralization is not an option, so no, no raw max block increase with SegWit.  That was never on the table, and won't be.
If the scam artists don't like it, there is more than one way to skin a snake.  UASF business is not in any way optimal, but the threat is very useful.
Jihan &amp; Co can either shape up, or ship out.  The hijacking attempt that is +2mb raw block increase is their wet dream. They're in for a nasty wakup call.
SegWit is the future and there is nothing they can do about it.
@_date: 2017-06-05 00:00:29
Seriously though. Piddly little stuff like that really belongs on a sidechain. 
Come ONNNNNN SegWit!
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:42:51
heh heh... we've read plenty of "code" (if you can call it that) from hijacking projects that Jihan, Ver &amp; Co promote.
Zero technological merit whatsoever.  This 2x crap is no different. Just another grab at the raw max  block size increase they so desperately want,
and have been *denied* again, and again, by the Bitcoin community (for damn good reason).
SegWit will be activated, with no 2x bullshit from the snake oil salesmen. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:23:37
There is no NY "Agreement".  Nobody of any consequence is "in" this non-agreement.
It is just another shady hijacking attempt.  
Go sell your snake oil on /btc where it's welcome.
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:01:09
No, 2mb increase is completely unacceptable.  This would put even more power in already too large mining conglomerates that are attacking bitcoin.
The only ones that would be acceptable to are the scam artists pushing so hard for it. :(
If anything, we need a decrease. 1mb is already too large.
OR... a *safe* way to use the block size we have more intelligently. SegWit is all ready to roll out right now. THAT is more than acceptable!
Well, except to the above mentioned gangsters blocking it for their own selfish reasons. :(
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:38:37
Again, there will be no raw max block size increase hard fork. 
Let Jihan and his goons try... it would be the absolute end of them, which is why they have not.  
Now they're getting desperate, making loud noises because they are scared shitless of the UASF.  
Jihan &amp; Co. is all bark, no bite. You can almost smell the fear.
This 2x nonsense is just more of the same snake oil.  Only yet another (failed) hijacking attempt.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:20:59
If you support the hijacking attempts of people like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co,
don't be surprised if actual cryptocurrency and Bitcoin advocates don't like it. They are the cancer on the face of crypto, and we can't be rid of them too soon.
If you want to support them and their propaganda / disinformation / hijacking attempts, /btc &lt;-- is that way.  Such snake oil salesmen basically run the place and your loyalties to them will be welcome there.
@_date: 2019-05-07 13:04:18
The meaning of "script" in this context needs much more explanation.
This is only in the context of smart transactions.  What they're allowed to be used for.  Sort of a rule set, put simply. Smart signatures also play a roll.

They have no plan of doing anything with SegWit at all.
All this 2x crap is is just another push for a raw max block size increase, through a Hard Fork no less.
Shady shit, and no way it will happen.
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:17:24
Last thing anyone needs (except the scam artists pushing it) is this 2x hijacking manouver.

SegWit will activate, but without any such 2x nonsense.
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:12:34


Nothing of the kind has happened. 
Some scam artists staged yet another hijacking attempt, and are (yet again) adding to the already huge steaming pile of disinformation and propaganda they are responsible for.
We are talking about Jihan and his goons, and the disreputable mining concerns they have under their thumb.
Jihan, Ver &amp; Co have done nothing but damage bitcoin, with one hijack attempt after the next. They are only destructive.
Now, go spread your bullshit over at /btc, or any of the many cesspools of disinformation under similar control. This ridiculous wall of lies is fully welcome in such palces.
Legitimate cryptocurrency forums such as this one have had quite enough of their propaganda campaigns.  People here do know what's up.
@_date: 2018-12-25 03:55:17
how do you "lose" bitcoin?
Hole in your pocket?  This makes no sense.
It might be worth less compared to (fiat of choice) but you still have the same amount of Bitcoin, and the price can go up again.
So no, nothing was "lost".
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:26:49
What a steaming pile of propaganda.
Raw max block size increase would put even more power into the hands of shady mining outfits like Jihan's. That is no answer.
We have SegWit all ready to go, but these disreputable miners are blocking it. This is despicable and the community is tiring of this terrorist BS.
There will be no raw max block size increase.  SegWit is what the community wants and needs.
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:31:12
They were in no way formal, and they included ridiculous demands for a raw max block size increase.
Nobody in their right mind is going to put even more power in the hands of these hijackers. 
SegWit is the way forward, and without catering to unscrupulous mining concerns.
@_date: 2017-07-03 06:08:14
SegWit + sidechain solutions such as Lightning, most definitely will improve things.  Besides, SegWit alone is a de-facto block size increase,  a *SAFE* one.
Blindly, willy-nilly increasing max block size, with no protections against the even further mining power centralization it would promote, would be pure folly.
SegWit is a more efficient use of the block size we have now. It must go through first, then we can talk about other *safe* scaling solutions.
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:56:31

something like BCH is not a fork. It is not even a  legitimate altcoin.
The only way for a fork to keep the original project name is if it comes from inside that project.
Outside forks can use to code, but all other resources, including name and blockchain, belong to the original project.
Trying to steal them just shows the "fork" is nothing other than a sleazy takeover attempt.

Please stop with all this "DOOM!!!!".
A raw max block size increase will lead to even more mining power centralization. This cannot be allowed to happen.
SegWit opens the door to *safe*, sane, more efficient use of the block size we have now. 
Any of the things you call "problems" with solutions such as Lightning pale in comparison to giving Jihan, Ver &amp; Co even more control over Bitcoin. 
There will be no hard fork for a raw max block size increase. That would be insane, no matter how much disinformation and propaganda the disreputable miners and snake oil salesmen spew to support it.
@_date: 2016-07-30 06:45:26
"consensus" was never in question whatsoever.
The blatant propaganda paid for by these scam artists to derail serious bitcoin discussion is nothing more than destructive spam that needs to be handled. The mods here have done well in this.
Those scam artists that continue to insist that this "consensus" is an actual issue, very often being incredibly abusive and derailing any serious conversations, are very much deserving of being banned.
Consensus is, was, and continues to be that Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:11:13
because it is a raw max block size increase... Segwit uses the block size differently than what they are proposing. 
SegWit's handling is vastly superior.
Anyway, this is all irellevant, as nobody in their right mind is going to trust some handful of incompetent "devs" under Jihan's control.

Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. have proven, again and again, with their destructive behavior, how toxic they are. 
The only finger that has been pointed, is at such detestable actions against Bitcoin, Crypto, and Open Source, that they have been guilty of. And rightfully so!
This is not a "debate".
There is blatant disinformation and propaganda, from shady outfits such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, against legitimate concurrency experts and advocates.
Go ahead and spew support for the scam artists and their hijacking schemes, 
just don't be surprised if legitimate crypto forums such as this one call out the bullshit. We've seen it all too often.

that is exactly the problem.   8 will be full too before we know it,
and with that comes exponential centralization of mining power.
Only the very largest mining concerns will be able to afford the bandwidth to deal with larger blocks, pushing the smaller ones out.
This cannot be allowed. We already see how much trouble such unscrupulous mining concerns such as Jihan and his cronies are causing. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:08:52

Which core devs exactly?
In any case, it would be no part of bitcion.  It would be, by all rights, an altcoin.  Albeit one spamming up the bitcoin blockchain instead of their own.
Jihan and his goons don't have a chance which is why they haven't tried something so ridiculous before. They know their 2x crap won't ever go live, but then they can bitch and moan that they've somehow been cheated.  lol

Translation:  Pay the kidnapper, knowing full well they will kill your loved one anyway.
The tyrant Jihan cannot seriously be trying to include himself in the Bitcoin community.  
He and his band of pirates are doing everything they can to hijack Bitcoin.
There is no "compromise" possible with such gangsters. There will be no raw block size increase HF.
Giving into their demands would be absolute lunacy, leading to even further power centralization.
SegWit or status quo.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:05:08
The source code is free to copy and use. The rest of a project's resources, such as name, and in this case blockchain, remain the original project's. 
Gangsters such as Jihan, Ver and Co. have zero interest in legitimate competition, else they would make an altcoin project. They have neither the interest, nor the capability,
so we see them constantly trying to hijack Bitcoin for their own greedy schemes. :(

@_date: 2017-06-15 03:01:57
have you not been paying attention at all, or maybe you're pretty new to Bitcoin?
Jihan Ver is a man in China that has control of the largest manufacture of bitcoin mining hardware.  
He has shadily used this leverage to his advantage, gaining a dangerous amount of control over mining power.
Basically, miners support him, or they do not buy the equipment.  
Not only that, they put a back door OFF SWITCH in their equipment.  That came out a few months ago when people meticulously examined the firmware because...
it was found they were cheating with a hash "shortcut", not following the bona fide bitcoin algorithm.  This gives the hardware they use an unprecedented advantage.  
Monopolistic, shady, abusive practices galore from this Jihan Wu and his cronies. Some speculate that the Chinese government is in on it and are a large influence. It would not be surprising, seeing all the crap that's been pulled.
Now, we have SegWit all ready to go, and it has overwhelming support from not only Bitcoin / Crypto experts, but businesses and the entire Bitcoin community, but it needs 95% mining hash power to activate.
The ONLY thing blocking it are unscrupulous mining concerns under Jihan's thumb.  He is holding back progress for his own greedy profit.
So, to answer your question, centralization has already gone too far, and bad actors such as Jihan, Roger Ver &amp; Co are destructively trying to hijack bitcioin for their own benefit.
The LAST thing we need is larger blocks, that would push smaller miners off the map, giving these scam artists even more power. 
This cannot be allowed to happen.
SegWit is a SAFE increase in block size, plus much, much more. It is the way forward.
@_date: 2017-06-11 09:00:17

You'd be lying.
@_date: 2016-07-30 07:07:29
Zero real need for either of them.
Actually, the hard fork simply to willy-nilly increase blocksize with no protections against further centralization of mining power would be downright destructive.
Lightningcoin need their own damn blockchain (and forum for that matter). Enough of that silliness. It is not needed in the least.
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:56:09
No, your flat earth crap cannot be argued with any type of logic or reason. 
You need to look at what's going on. Already with 1mb max block size we have such huge mining organizations such as Jihan Wu's, that have basically stopped all progress for their own greedy interests. 
Increasing the block size will only push out smaller miners, centralizing mining power even further, for the benefit of such shady hijackers such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
This cannot be allowed to happen.
SegWit is the answer. After that comes more SAFE scaling solutions, without the extreme danger a raw max block size increase would involve.
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:06:14

We've seen this bullshit all too often, it is all too easy to spot.
Go back to /btc where it's welcome. People here know what's up.
Again:  there will be no raw max block size increase.  That would give scam artists such as Jihan even more power.

This is the lie, propegated by scam artists such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, that would directly profit from it.
Such a block size increase would only encourage even further mining power centralization, pushing even more smaller miners off the playing field, giving already-too-big ones more power.
Raw max block size increase is no solution at all, and will not happen.
SegWit is a safe, more efficient use of block size, and is the way forward.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:57:32
What a steaming pile of disinformation.
the only people clamoring for a raw max block size increase are shady snake oil salesmen such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.  
They, and the dirty mining outfits Jihan has under his filthy thumb, are NO part of any community, except their band of hiwaymen.
They have been, and continue to, work directly AGAINST bitcoin, and our community, as well as crypto and open source in general.
This is why they have been denied their "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda demands, again and again.
Such a raw increase would only allow such yahoos to gain even more centralization.
Jihan &amp; his puppets are a small part of "miners" and have NOTHING in common with the majority of *reputable* mining outfits *actually* supporting Bitcoin, and SegWit.
Take your bullshit back to /btc where it belongs. People on legit crypto forums are sick of it.

You think these fools will run some buggy software that Jihan creates?  heh heh,  let them try, and fail.  They'll give up on that idea very quickly.
No, this x2 scam is DOA. There's no way it will be integrated into bona fide Bitcoin, and nobody is going to turn development over to a handful of yahoos under Jihan's control.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:33:55


False, That would make the problem worse.
The problem we have is that a group of unscrupulous miners is blocking SegWit (hello Jihan). A raw max block size increase would give them even more power. 
Not gonna happen.
SegWit is a *safe* more efficient use of the current block size. The side channels it allows are what you are seeking. It also does it without the very real danger of even further mining power centralization that increasing block size would bring.
After SegWit is implemented, then we can talk about further *safe* scaling solutions. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:45:44
Correct.  And the bitcoin community knows that giving destructive hijackers,
like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co their way,  would outright destroy Bitcoin.
Those snake oil salesmen need to stop blocking progress,
start signalling SegWit, as they should have LONG ago,
so Bitcoin can move forward.  Otherwise, they're just harming it.
Still, in the face of all their hostile hijacking attempts, Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:47:51
There is no "big block camp",  there are only gangster hijacking attempts by the likes of Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.  
Giving them their way with a raw max block size increase would be insane.
They have zero interest in compromise, only control for their own greedy profit. 
No, not gonna happen.  Bitcoin is doing just fine. SegWit or status quo.
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:18:37

there is no "debate".  It's clear what your motives are,

@_date: 2017-06-11 08:21:39
It has zero to do with SegWit.

This further hijacking attempt is not any type of "compromise", just another power grab.  A very transparent one.

Based on what evidence?  Zero.  
On the other hand, cryptocurrency experts agree that safe and sane scaling that is SegWit, is the way forward.
IF, by some stretch of the imagination, bigger blocks are needed someday, then we'll have plenty of time to find a SAFE way to implement them.
Doing it now is a road to disaster. It would put bitcoin right into the hands of its enemies (hijacking attempts run by the likes of Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.).
No, There will be no hardfork for raw block size increase with zero protections.   
SegWit comes first, then we see.
@_date: 2017-06-04 06:07:07
The idea that a raw max block size increase will magically turn Bitcoin into something like PayPal or Visa is absurd.
Quite the opposite, it would fully encourage even further mining power centralization, giving hijackers like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co even more ammunition in their hostile takeover attempts.
SegWit is the way forward. It is a *safe* block size increase, plus opens the door to so much more scaling strategies, without puting bitcoin in the hands of its enemies.
It would be wonderful if we had more miners.  The current max block size is already too large, and it's led to this attack by unscrupulous miners (Jihan &amp; Co.).  We need better usage of the block size we have now (that SegWit provides).  No dangerous hardfork, no giving in to terrorist demands. 
With the side channels SegWit enables (also described in the original Bitcoin white paper), any block size increase could be completely unnecessary. If not, then there will be PLENTY of time to implement SAFE ways to do it, without the horrendous danger it would bring with it today.
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:36:45
SegWit is the only reasonable solution.
A raw increase in Max Block Size would only make these problems much worse. 
You are right, the disreputable mining conglomerates under Jihan's rule are blocking Bitcoin progress out of greed / politics, not any technological reason.

After SegWit is locked in, none of the other crap matters, least of all Jihan's latest hijacking manouver 2x.
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:15:51
No, this 2x scam is not SegWit, just a last desperate power grab. 
Still a no-go. 
There will be no raw max block size increase HF.
Jihan and his goons can take a long walk off a short dock.
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:49:26
Easy to dismiss such blatant falsehoods.
Bitcoin is growing. No matter how often you spew this blatant misinformation and propaganda, that won't change.
Allowing one agent or conglomerate to gain 51% or more of mining power could well be the end of bitcoin alltogeather.
The only people pushing for that are get-rich-quick scam artists.
Please stop supporting them by repeating their nonsense so much here.
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:29:40
We've all heard plenty of this propaganda.
Zero reason to up the blocksize atm with the optimizations coming down the pipe.
There are some that would like to just willy-nilly increase blocksize with no protections in place for the further centralization of mining power that would produce.
This cannot be allowed to happen. There is nothing "artificial" about it, just logical and safe.
Please stop with the DOOOOM tinfoil hat theories. Bitcoin is doing just fine.
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:29:35
You're absolutely right, of course. I wasn't thinking logically at all. My eherm... 'reasoning' was, what if it DOES keep going up? I had been watching it daily since 115€/BTC.
I only spent a miniscule amount, so no bother really. Just horribly funny timing. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:34:16


No way in hell Bitcoin devs will integrate this 2x scam. It is simply another push for a raw max block size increase.  Not gonna happen.
Jihan and his goons can go ahead and signal for actual SegWit, as they should have long ago...
 but nobody in their right mind will give them even more mining power centralization that their "Big Blocks NOW!" insanity would bring.
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:43:14
There are a few unscrupulous mining concerns (hello Jihan) that want bigger blocks.  And their paid shills that spread disinformation about it. Maybe a few crypto newbies that are duped by their propaganda for a time.
The vast amount of actual crypto experts and bitcoin enthusiasts know that a raw max block size increase is lunacy.
Not gonna happen.
SegWit is a safe, more efficient use of the block size we have. A de-facto increase as it stands.
Unscrupulous miners that want bigger blocks are blocking SegWit, against the will of the vast, vast majority.
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:41:51
This 2x scam has nothing to do with SegWit.
It is simply another shady push at a max block size increase.
These scam artists have been denied this again and again. It won't happen now, even if they're trying to identify their latest hijacking attempt with SegWit.
Actual SegWit will activate, and without any of this 2x nonsense. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 23:50:57
No, there possibly will be an increase in block size LIMIT.  
No miner will do that if they actually value bitcoin. We have a hard enough time with even 1mb blocks as it is.
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:13:21
This 2x nonsense has zero to do with SegWit, and it is offensive that these snake oil salemen are trying to insinuate it does.
It is simply another attempt at a raw max block size increase.
A very pathetic one, that is very easily seen though.  Again: No.
You're not trying to have anything like a "civil conversation", what you're doing is asserting your support for the insane idea of "Big Blocks NOW!"  and I, and the Bitcoin community, are still having none of it.
If you've really been around and support actual Bitcoin so much like you say, there's no way you'd support putting more power in the hands of Jihan and his goons with a raw max block size increase.
Those two positions are completely opposite to one another.
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:06:58
Larger blocks require more bandwidth, and there your whole ridiculous "comparison" breaks down completely.
The only one not using reason is you, and others in the "Big Blocks NOW!" bandwagon.  1MB is arguably already too large, and willy-nilly increasing it will only encourage even further mining power centralization.
Giving scam artists like Jihan &amp; Co even more power is the LAST thing we need.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:02:38
Bitmain, aka Jihan, and the other mining concerns he has under his thumb, is the ONLY thing blocking SegWit.
This is a well known fact.

@_date: 2017-06-02 00:58:00
there never was any "SegWit2x charter".
Disabling ASICboost is a good thing, but not by giving such scam artists their way.

SegWit or status quo.

This is why any project that pushes to further reduce the anonymity of bitcoin is a threat.

Please don't call it a "debate".  There never was one.
What we had is some disreputable miners blocking Bitcoin progress. A debate is between two legitimate sides,  Jihan's is nothing of the sort.
Jihan &amp; Co are now signalling SegWit, as they should have LONG ago. Once it locks in we can pretty much ignore his ridiculous 2x power grab and continue on with the roadmap.

There was no "agreement".  Nobody from Bitcoin was even invited, and no way in hell did anyone Agree to anything.
This is just one shovel more on the already huge, steaming pile of propaganda that yahoos like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. have tried to dump on Bitcoin.
It means absolutely zero. There will be no raw max bock size increase, no matter how much money Jihan pours into propaganda supporting it.
Any serious bitcoin company that listens to him and his goons, are incompetent and deserve what they get if they follow his JihanCoin HardFork fantacy.
Bitcoin is having none of it.  Doing just fine as we are.
SegWit will activate, with or without such snake oil salesmen. Or not.  Either way, Bitcoin is doing just fine.
Oh, there is the UASF on the near horizon though...  heh heh.. Jihan is quaking in his boots over that, which is the reason for all this disinformation campaign lately. 
2x was DOA, just like his buddy Ver's Unlimited scam.
@_date: 2017-06-11 07:44:06

The one that is actually written by a large and knowlegable dev team:  Bitcoin.
JihanCoin and their buggy software, written by a handful incompetent "devs", under Jihan's control... who in their right mind would trust money to that lunacy? 
Knowing these scam artists, they'd probably write closed source wallet for it too.   No, there will be no max block size HF.  This latest 2x scam is just hot air, like the hijacking attempts before it.
Segwit will activate, without any 2x nonsense.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:14:54
SegWit has been ready to go for MONTHS now.
The only thing holding it back are a few unscrupulous scam artists (hello Jihan).  
This 2x scam is just another hijacking attempt. 
They're getting pretty desperate. You can almost smell the UASF fear.
@_date: 2017-06-27 08:21:58
this 2x crap is just another raw max block size increase.  Something Jihan &amp; Co have tried, and been denied, again and again.
This would only give then even more power, centralize bitcoin even further.  That way lies madness.  Ain't gonna happen.
Jihan &amp; Co should have started signaling SegWit LONG ago. They can go ahead now,
but there's no way it comes with a max block size increase. That's just another desperate power grab on his part, and therefore, total scam.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:26:49


This is blatant disinformation, the very opposite of how Bitcoin works. People here do know this.
SegWit will come first, as a SAFE and sane optimization of current block size. After that, other SAFE scaling strategies can be discussed (and they already are).
A raw max block size increase will only push smaller mining outfits further off the map, giving even MORE control to shady, already-too-large conglomerations such as those under Jihan's thumb. This is reality.


There has been NO "agreement", whatsoever, to a raw max block size increase.  Your assertion of such just shows you either:
1. have bought the snake oil Jihan is selling,
2. are working for him, against Bitcoin.
Well, in either case, you're working for him against bitcoin.  If you are doing so in good faith (dubious), you need to stop posting and learn how bitcoin in specific, and distributed cryptocurrency networks in general, *actually* work.
See, people here do know, and we're pretty tired of such nonsense.
Cryptocurrency experts, specifically Bitcoin experts, as well as the entire Bitcoin community, have rejected this ludicrous "Big Blocks NOW!" scheme, again and again, and will continue to.
Now with the threat of a UASF, Jihan &amp; Co are really doubling down on their bullshit.  You can almost smell the fear.
Jihan will either conform to what is actually good for Bitcoin, or he will go out of business.  
SegWit is mandatory, with *no* ridiculous x2 raw block size lunacy. 
 It is only a matter of time, and his time is running out fast.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:26:21
This x2 scam is in no way a "compromise".  It is simply another power grab.  
There will be no max block size increase HF.
@_date: 2016-07-30 12:12:35
Willy-nilly demanding an instant increase in max block size is destructive. It's not an "understanding", it's a fact.
The danger of letting too much mining power fall under one roof is a very, very real threat. Bigger block size with no protections is insanity.
That is not hostility whatsoever, it is simply logic. Something the scammers and spammers try to circumvent for their own profit. 
Please stop helping them.
@_date: 2016-07-29 17:40:22
There are no "two different versions".
There is bitcoin, and some get rich quick yahoo's.  
We cannot up block size simply because of political spam from fly by night scammers. 
Any issues that might be need attention are being handled, legitimately, by bitcoin devs. 
The block size, and bitcoin, are just fine. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:25:51


This is blatant misinformation / propaganda.
Only unscrupulous mining concerns under Jihan's thumb are not behind SegWit.  They have just enough mining power to block it (just over 10%).
If they had 51%, it would be the death of Bitcoin, which is what their 2x raw max block size insanity would encourage.
That is why it has been denied them, again and again.
Ain't gonna happen.  SegWit or status quo.
@_date: 2017-06-04 06:41:26
no, BU has no Bitcoin holders. 
They are not members of the bitcoin community whatsoever.
They are either victims of the scam artist Roger Ver, or are working with him in the hostile hijacking attempt that is UnlimitedCoin. (one of a long line of scams we've all seen, such as XT, Classic, etc... this is just the latest).
They are most welcome to actually join the Bitcoin community, 
but that will, by definition, require them *not* working to destroy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:39:09
So you are calling the assertions of cryptocurrency experts, Bitcoin devs, and knowledgeable Bitcoin supporters: "Melodrama".
I strongly suggest you learn a bit about how Bitcoin works;  A raw max block size increase would directly encourage even more mining power centralization. Putting even more power in the hands of hijackers such as Jihan is the LAST thing bitcoin needs.  It would do no good even if that threat wasn't so large.
This is why said Crypto, Bitcoin &amp; supporters have denied shady charachters such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co their "Big Blocks NOW!" schemes again, and again.
People here do actually know what's up.  I suggest you go try your silly disinformation attempts over on /btc.  They are welcome there.
SegWit is the way forward:  as SAFE and sane optimization of the block size we do have, 
with none of the dangers involved in giving such snake oil salesmen their way.
Segwit will activate, or status quo, or UASF,  but Jihan's latest 2x scam has zero chance.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:12:44
This is not a compromise whatsoever.
It's just another power grab for raw max block size.
This nonsense has no business using the name SegWit at all.
@_date: 2017-06-02 00:46:50
Indeed.  Just more bogus "Big Blocks NOW!" propaganda.
Ain't gonna happen. The LAST thing Bitcoin needs is even further mining power centralization that would cause.
SegWit or status quo.
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:38:39
What you said is silly and unsubstantiated.
SegWit is anything but, as asserted by Bitcoin experts.
Giving such snake oil salesmen as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co the "Big Blocks NOW!" they are so desperatey pushing for, is fully *unreasonable*,
has been denied again and again, by Bitcoin experts, and the Bitcoin community. 
So yes, you're right, it's silly to state things with no reason behind it, like supporting a raw max block size increase.
And no, you're wrong, there are very good reasons why giving more power to such bad actors is not going to happen, and was never on the table.
SegWit will go forward without any dangerous block size increase.
Jihan will accept that, or we have status quo,  or he gets his feet cut out from under him with a UASF.  
In any case, that joker and his cronies had better shape up and get with the program, or they'll be *forced* to make their own altcoin, as they should have from the start.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:58:15
this 2x scam is only supported by shady hijackers.
Jihan and his goons will not have their way. 
They have no business even using the SegWit name for their destructive scams.
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:13:16
Seeing as these gansters are the largest threat cryptocurrency has (of yet) seen, probably quite a few.  And for damn good reason.
Protecting open source and crypto in general, and specifically Bitcoin, from such destructive scam artists is vital to it's health, longevity and usefulness. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:06:34
There is no "debate".  There are a few large, unscrupulous mining concerns, under Jihan's control, that are attacking Bitcoin.
This latest 2x scam is just one more in a long line of such power grabs.  Jihan and his goons have been denied a raw max block size increase again, and again, for damn good reason.
Not gonna happen.
SegWit will activate, but with no shady 2x crap.
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:51:00
Then this is a sign that they are not to be trusted.
This 2x scam is just like so many others before it.
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:45:04
Where the hell did you get THAT steaming pile of disinformation?
Oh wait, Jihan &amp; his goons that are pushing it.
give us a break.  They have been denied a raw max block size increase again and again, and again,
For damn good reason.  Nobody in their right mind will give those yahoos even MORE centralization.  they've already held up SegWit long enough with their nonsense.
Jihan &amp; Co better ship up, or they'll be shipped out. The only reason they are so desperately pushing this latest 2x scam now is because they're scared to hell of the impending UASF.  As they should be!
Anyway, this 2x crap won't get implemented into Bitcoin.  Never had a chance. It's just the same old bullshit from Jihan &amp; co.  
Let them go ahead and Hard Fork  lol  They should have made their own Altcoin to begin with, instead of constantly trying to hijack bitcoin.

Very convenient way to transfer money from the lower and middle classes to the ones that already have FAR too much to be anything but cancerous to the planet we all live on.

Hi, just to let you know, there is no "divide" at all. Never was.
What there *is* is a band of unscrupulous mining concerns, under Jihan's lead, aggressively trying to hijack Bitcoin for their own selfish greed.
No, Crypto and Bitcoin experts agree that a raw max block size increase would be very dangerous.  Nobody in their right mind is willing to give Jihan &amp; Co even MORE power.
SegWit is the way forward, only after that can we talk about further *safe* scaling methods.
There will be no raw max block size HF. Was never on the table, for damn good reason.
There never was any "NY agreement", that x2 scam is just another hijacking attempt.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:56:03
You obviously need to do some more research.  I strongly suggest you get your information from somewhere other that /btc.  Sounds like you're just repeating more of their propaganda.
SegWit allows more actual transactions per block by handling the witness data separately.  This, among other things, negates the danger that a raw max block size increase would cause, while offering more throughput at the same time. This is safe optimization of our current block size.
It also opens the door to other safe and sane scaling strategies such as sidechains (lighting &amp; co). 
A raw max block size increase would do nothing but cause even further mining power centralization, which is why nobody but shady gangsters such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co are for it.
The bitcoin devs, and community have denied these yahoos their "Big Blocks NOW!" idiocy again and again.
Not gonna happen.  SegWit or status quo.
well, then there's always the UASF too..  :)
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:32:42

@_date: 2017-06-14 22:09:24
The only ones blocking SegWit are Jihan and his goons, and the ones under their thumb.  It's high time for these hijackers to get booted from the business.
Let them TRY a HF...  we've all been waiting to call their bluff. They won't, of course. Jihan has a loud bark, but he has no teeth.
All he can do is continue shitting on Bitcoin as he has been doing, and continue being brushed off. There will be no raw Max Block Size increase. This has been rejected again and again, despite all hijacking attempts.
In the end, Jihan &amp; Co. will use SegWit, as the Bitcoin community consensus mandates, or he will be out of business.  It really is as simple as that.
@_date: 2017-06-11 07:45:34
Who the hell is "they"?   2 or 3 devs, that *explicitly* stated they were speaking only for *themselves*.

There never was any bona fide "agreement".
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:22:03

@_date: 2017-06-14 07:24:53
A raw max block size increase will only give Jihan and his goons more power.  Not gonna happen.

@_date: 2017-06-14 22:40:43
Ancient history.  
Roger Ver has destroyed any of good standing with the Bitcoin, Crypto and Open Source communities LONG ago.
He's actively demonstrated, again and again, that he's not to be trusted, whatsoever. 
Again:  XT,  Classic,  Unlimited... and a long line of other scams / disinformation / politics directly aimed at harming Btcoin, Crypto, and Open Source,
for his own greedy profit. Now his "evangelizing" = snake oil sales. :(
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:02:25
A hardfork to raw max block size increase = more power for Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.
Such has been rejected, again and again, for very good reason, by all Bitcoin experts, and the bitcoin community.  
What Bitcoin needs is SegWit, what we do NOT need is to give even more power to hijackers such as Jihan &amp; Co.
A raw block size increase pushes smaller mining outfits off the map and centralizes mining power in already-too-large outfits like Jihan is running. This is a very well known dynamic of such distributed projects.  The threat of a 51% must be defended against at all costs. 
If the "BIG BLOCKS NOW!" scammers get their way, we'd soon have just another centrally controlled Paypal type system, instead of Bitcoin. :(
Not gonna happen.  Status Quo is much better.  Bitcoin is doing just fine.
There IS the problem of such unscrupulous mining outfits like Jihan has power over,  and there is more than one way to skin a snake. 
He and his cronies are quaking in their boots over this new threat of a user activated soft fork kicking them to the curb (where, by all rights, they belong). 
It will be interesting to see Jihan's bluff called, but in the end it will make no difference.
Bitcoin has continued onward and upward through many such threats, and will continue to.
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:37:30
Fine, but then don't dare claim to be working for the benefit of Bitcoin, or any part of its community.
Unless you've written an alternative *safe* scaling method? Then we'd be all ears!  It would go into testing (as SegWit has been through) immediately.
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:10:16
This is very cool, not desperate at all.

Disreputable hijacking attempts from shady assholes like Jihan and his goons are to be discouraged with extreme prejudice.

People, including me, *are* judging him on the complete lack of merit, indeed its opposite, that he has consistently displayed.
You yourself assert that you don't like him... are you also saying that you have no good reason for that?
If not, then how can you hypocritically accuse others of the same?
The Open Source community in general, Cryptocurrency &amp; Bitcoin communities in specific, hold the man in disdain for very, very good reasons. He is a scammer, bad actor, hijacker. Has attempted to do all kinds of harm to us (sometimes successfully). 
Again, in this world of Meritocracy, such snake oil salesmen are discouraged with extreme prejudice. He brings negative value.
@_date: 2017-06-27 08:11:48
There is no "debate".  There is a group of shady miners trying to hijack bitcoin.   This whole drama is all their fault.  
They've been denied a max block size increase again, and again, and won't get one now either.
No matter or manner of bullshit and propaganda will change anything.  There was no HK "agreement", nor NY "agreement", 
just very obvious power grabs by dishonest, untrustworthy mining outfits run by Jihan.
He can go ahead and signal SegWit, as he should have LONG ago, but he's insane if the thinks Bitcoin is going to hand him even MORE control with a max block size increase. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:02:25
Shady hijacking manouvers, "Big Blocks NOW!!" nonsense,

Attacking a community is not being part of it.  Very much the opposite. He and his shady mining concerns are a huge threat to the future of bitcoin.  
Such behavior is condemned by the cryptocurrency and open source community for damn good reason. He is trying to destroy it.
And yes, the scam artist Ver and his latest hostile hijacking attempt Unlimited is also the exact opposite of Bitcoin Community.  He's also directly trying to destroy and completely control Bitcoin, as well as whatever he can get his grubby paws on.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:09:49
This x2 bullshit is ridiculous.  It is just a raw max block size increase.  It will give hijackers such as Jihan and his goons even more power.  That would be insane.
Not gonna happen.
SegWit is the obvious solution, without any of their x2 crap.
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:42:54
There is no hope of this 2x crap      making it into bitcoin.
Jihan, Ver &amp; their handfull of incompetent "devs" will release some buggy, useless client for their own ChinaCoin.
Bitcoin will go on as usual, and *real* SegWit will activate, with none of this max block size silliness. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:35:22
Reputable miners are awesome.
What nobody likes are the disreputable ones like Jihan and his band of hijackers.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:52:23
They support this latest 2x scam.  That has nothing to do with supporting SegWit.  
Very disappointing so far.  Hopefully Bitfury will shape up.
or they'll be shipped out like Jihan and the rest of the unscrupulous goons under his control.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:27:04
The above ineffectual shaming attempt is typical for /btc type brigades:
When their disinformation and propaganda are rejected; they go straight to shit-slinging. :(
Not only /bitcoin, but many other reputable cryptocurrency forums, are being attacked by (yet another) nasty propaganda campaign. It will most likely get worse as August 1. approaches.
Fortunately, after that, Jihan &amp; Co. will either do their worst, and smother themselves with a ridiculous HF attempt, or they will show, yet again, that all their pompous grandstanding is a total sham.
Bitcoin will march onward and upward regardless, as it has done through all theses hijacking attempts.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:14:51
There is no scaling "debate". What there is, is a lot of propaganda and disinformation from scam artists like Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, and their hijacking attempts against Bitcoin.
This Bitmain bullshit is just another example of such. :(
Bitcoin is all ready to go with SegWit, with overwhelming support (except for said hijackers). 
I hope you're right and Jihan tries a HF. Personally I think if he was going to, it would have happened already. All huff and puff. His bark is bigger than his bite.
He's just scared shitless at the UASF, as it should be.  They need to ship up, or will be shipped out.  
Stop blocking SegWit now Jihan.
@_date: 2017-06-11 07:59:12
Thanks for the head's up.
@_date: 2017-06-03 12:36:15
What?  So tyrants like Jihan and his band of unscrupulous miners are "parents" now?  No, they are gangsters. Opposition is fully in order to their abusive hijacking attempts.
UASF is a natural reaction to a very abusive situation. 
I'm for keeping status quo until SegWit eventually goes through. Zero chance of a hard max block size increase. 
If Jihan &amp; Co won't stop their evil ways, then there needs to be some solution. They're blocking progress for their own personal greed.
The threat of something like UASF would be a huge blow to them.  Better they shape up before they're shipped out completely.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:51:19
Out of who's ass did you pull those numbers?  
oh right, Jihan's and his goons bitpay, and other unscrupulous outfits under his dirty thumb.
The actual bitcoin community (that those assholes are no part of) want SegWit, want Bitcoin to progress upwards and onward. 
Jihan, Ver and their goons better ship up, or they will be shipped out. 
This is what the community and bitcoin devs want, because it is what is sorely needed.
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:59:53


The problems are completely caused by a few unscrupulous, greedy mining concerns (hello Jihan). 
The community wants SegWit, There is no disagreement.
SegWit is ready to go, Jihan &amp; Co. are blocking it.

This is all redundant, because nobody in their right mind is going to run software written by a handful of incompetent yahoos under Jihan's control.
This entire 2x scam was DOA. The only interesting thing about it is how it has exposed other unscrupulous people / organizations that are foolishly trying to push it as something serious.
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:28:25
What a steaming pile of disinformation.
Take your Jihan cheer leading back to /btc where it belongs.
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:42:05
You asked, so I told you.  Bandwidth is the major problem with willy-nilly increasing block size.
There must be protections in place to guard against even further mining centralization that would bring.
It would disadvantage smaller mining outfits, not to mention individuals running full nodes, and benefit already-too-large mining conglomerates.

@_date: 2017-06-24 12:48:46
A lot of miners do have integrity.  The ones that are signalling SegWit without Jihan's newest 2x scam.
There have been cases when mining pools approached that deadly 51%, and correctly encouraged their members to split off into smaller groups.
Of course, gangsters like Jihan &amp; Co. are doing the exact opposite.  This 2x nonsense is just another power grab, looking to gain even more centralization.  This cannot be allowed if Bitcoin is to survive.
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:17:37
There is zero compromise in this 2x scam. Just another raw max block size hijacking manoeuver. 
Not gonna happen.

They are the ones attacking Bitcoin, cryptocurrency and open source.
No, there will be no raw max block size increase. That is not a "compromise" at all. 
It would give these hijackers even more power. Not gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:43:02
Segwit is a safe and sane OPTIMIZATION of the current block size.
What Jihan and his goons are pushing for is a RAW max block size increase.
Funny enough, even with their latest 2x scam, they couldn't even figure out how to do THAT!  lololol.  No idea why, but an actual Bitcoin dev clued them in.
Really, it would only be a good thing if they finally tried a HF.  That would finally be the end of their nonsense. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:46:16
The software never will be ready either.  
We've seen the quality of "devs" that snake oil salesmen such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co. use.
Nobody in their right mind is going to trust a handful of incompetents under Jihan's control.
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:52:10
No, these idiots are supporting Jihan's newest scam / power grab. 
Miners signaling 2x is a very bad thing.
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:57:11
There is no possible "compromise" with such bad actors as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co.  
What you are talking about has nothing to do with SegWit, only with giving such hijacking attempts even more power. 
There will be no raw max block size increase, not before SegWit is activated anyway, and then it quite possibly will never be needed.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:09:00
Nobody is jumping through any hoops except the same unscrupulous miners under Jihan's thumb,
that are pushig this latest 2x scam. 
They can easily be ignored.  Let them fork their own coin, as they should have in the beginning.  It will be the end of their destructive interference in Bitcoin.
This 2x crap has no business associating itself with SegWit, or Bitcoin for that matter. Nobody in their right mind is going to run some buggy software written by a handful of incompetent "devs" under Jihan's control.
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:40:13

A  Cornell University study indicated....  what a crock of shit.
You mean Bitmain told you to spread this hoopla.  
The risks of even further mining centralization are well known by all cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin experts, as well as Bitcoin aficionados. 
A raw max block size increase is incredibly dangerous, which is why it has been rejected again, and again, by Bitcoin experts and the community.
The only people pushing for such lunacy are bad actors such as Jihan, Ver &amp; Co, and their goons.  (maybe a few crypto newbies that they fool, for a time)
Increasing block size with zero protections in place against such destructive influences would turn bitcoin into just another centrally controlled payment method.  Go use paypal if you want that.
No, Jihan and his disreputable mining concerns will not have their way. 
SegWit will be activated, and after, we can discuss further SAFE strategies for expansion.  Not before.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:07:45
x2 nonsense is a total scam.  Just another hijacking attempt.
A hard fork for raw max block size increase has been denied, again and again as the dangerous insanity that it is.

That's fine though.   It is an infinitely better alternative than giving these shady mining outfits their way, and seeing bitcoin completely destroyed by them.

That's not design, that's just life, man. We are all responsible for ourselves. Making everything dumbed down to the lowest common denominator just creates unreasonable cost (and worse, wasteful government interference).
BitCoin is NOT some big conspiracy, quite the opposite.
I think the problem is that the learning curve can seem very steep, but online banking can seem like rocket science at first too. Both are still VERY useful tools, if used responsibly.
Responsible is, in this case, learning the system you are using. Invest a little time so it is familiar, and suddenly that 'big scary' wild thing turns into your lap dog. :)
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:27:50
There is zero contradiction, because your ignorant assumption that the Bitcoin communtiy rejects Jihan, Ver &amp; Co's hijacking attempts, 
is somehow because "everyone does it", is absurd.
There is damn good reason that such shady characters have been denied their raw max block size increase, again and again: It would directly encourage even MORE mining power centralization. Directly to the destruction of Bitcoin, and to the profit of such destructive players.
Jihan and his goons, and the mining conglomerates under his dirty thumb, have been trying to hijack bitcoin for quite a while now. Ver and his long line of scams (xt, classic, now unlimited) are no better.
They are working directly against Bitcoin itself, our community, as well as Cryptocurrency and Open Source in general. This is very well known.
Go ahead and continue to try to make pathetic excuses for them, but don't expect any kind of welcome in legitimate crypto forums such as this one.
I suggest you try /btc.  Its basically bought and paid for by Jihan, Ver &amp; Co,   they'll welcome your disinformation, strawman arguments, and propaganda with open arms.

That this 2x crap is DOA is nothing but fortunate.
It is only, yet another, desperate grab for a raw max block size increase.
We need none of it.  Such a thing has been rejected again, and again, by cryptocurrency experts, and the Bitcoin community.
SegWit will go through, but without any such insane raw block size increase.
After SegWit, we can talk about further SAFE scaling (which is already being worked on).

Such a block size increase has been denied Jihan, and other unscrupulous miners under his thumb, again and again, for damn good reason. No,  SigWit or status quo....
or possibly, Jihan's worst nightmare, UASF, which is why he's pushing this latest 2x hijacking maneuver so desperately.

The design is the design.  It will always be changing (hopefully improving). 
While I understand you'd like it to be click-n-go (me too!), it simply is not yet. Getting use to anything new (like the example of online banking) takes some investment. If you're not willing to invest the time to learn the current state of design, then it's probably not for you yet.
I also look forward to when everything is super easy and threads like this are never seen. For now though, it's just the nature of the beast.
Get that beast to work FOR you, tame it. This means taming yourself and how much time / effort you are willing to invest. Maybe that includes improving the design!!

There are wallets that let you change the transaction fee. [Electrum]( for example
Right now it is not really working as intended. I guess they never thought Bitcoin would be worth so much, monetarily speaking. I've been known to tune down the transaction fee more inline with the original intended values.
I agree though, it will be nice when they do the same in the main 'official' program.
