"Our life" like your family is automatically entitled to it, ugh.

Unless youre still up because you bought in more than a couple months ago?

Silver is the best conductor (copper 2nd iirc) but they tarnish unlike gold.

I have no bch, i traded my forked coins for btc. You must be really new here. There used to be tons of new posts about local businesses starting to accept btc as payment. Jesus christ, btc initially gained value because it was used as currency on dark web markets such as Silkroad.

You are delusional. Any crypto could potentially be a store of value or cash and to go to the moon, you need to be both.

It never used to be just a store of value, remember when it was useful for small transactions? . Bitcoin is experiencing growing pains and high tx fees are a symptom.  The whole 'store of value' is a shitty excuse imo.

I already told you i have no interest in bch, im invested in btc since 2013 and i want it ro succeed. It sounds like you have come into this very recently.  Why do you think everyone sees how important the lightning network is for bitcoins's future?  If you want it to go to the moon then it needs to be adopted world wide, and for that to happen to has to be a useable currency. The vast majority of people dont give a fuck about a store of value with long tx times and high fees because the vast majority of people dont invest their wealth.  Would you really store your wealth in a system that pays no interest or dividends and is expensive and timely to move wealth in and out of when there could be another crypto that does the same thing and is useable for transactions? The crypto world moves quickly and something else could take the lead if btc doesnt adapt. The real innovation here is blockchain technology and something else taking over is entirely possible, similar to how facebook killed myspace. Like i said, i want btc to succeed and this is why i think 'store of value' is a shitty excuse for the current situation which has literally only been the last few months.

So if it cant be used for anything, where is its value?  Everything that is a store of value such as gold actually has some demand because its useful. Its like if you couldnt use cash for buying shit easily then its pretty much worthless.

Regardless, 14% unemployment in a population of 186 million is a lot of people without work.

Ive been hodling since 2013 and i care.  Whats worse is the long transaction times. Its nerve wracking having btc in the wind for hours or even days when youre just moving amounts around.

I just ordered a LNS too. Once you transfer your btc to it, you use wallet apps in Chrome with your LNS connected to your PC to manage your btc.  Coinbase would only be used to buy or trade more btc if you wanted to.

Im pretty sure these people would rather have a stable job than spend all day trying to scam to make a living. As OP said in a previous post, you wouldnt understand unless you've been there.

But eventually when bitcoin cant be mined the entire system will rely on transaction fees. If no one spends coin and just hodls the whole thing will freeze up.  Thats a long way off though and plenty of time for development.

It doesnt have to be that expensive unless you want to 5 star the time. Plenty of people travel for long periods by budgeting well or working along the way.
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:07:51
I remember when it was all over 4chan when it was worthless and people were mining thousands with their pcs for shits n giggles. I thought it was dumb and didnt get into it. Ugh hindsights a bitch huh.
