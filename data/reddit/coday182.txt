And there’s just as good of a chance that you would have still held your position going into today and ate your lunch.

I work in the mortgage industry, and that’s not true.  People bite off more than they can chew all the time.

Lol if it were true I’d tell them “well you can still sell almost $50k worth of coins back .  You’re not broke.”

You’re alright, dumbfuck.

Another great point but you’re over a lot of people’s heads now.

You might want to take a Polysci and Econ class.

Other acceptable answers would have been Beanie Babjes or Furbies.

I think you missed point altogether.  They were calling out 95% of BTC holders who have absolutely zero interest about a decentralized currency, and would be trading them whether they were digital/physical/pogs/whatever.  In other words, band wagoners in it for the money.  
And then you have misleading posts like this one implying that holding BTC is how to stop the man.  When in reality the way to do that would be to boycott them.  And if all these “activists” truly meant what they said all the time, they’d do that.  But they won’t give up their Snickers Bars or name brand shoes, so their actions don’t match their words (or reddit posts).  
Some people would call it a “circle jerk.”

Nobody is trying to say that more adopters isn’t a good thing for BTC.  We’re arguing about X and you keep going back to Y.  We are talking about wealth inequality.  That BTC doesn’t fight the problem because the wealthy can hoard it just as easily.  
There is a false belief that crypto will take money OUT of their hands, but most of us would probably use our own coins to buy their shit lol.  Nobody is hating on people in here who want to get rich.  But, just say it like it is.  Lol.

Question for everyone who became economists during the past year...  How can ANY type of currency prevent the wealth gap?

I’m sure you do ��

So it’s short for polytical science, then?   Doesn’t sound right...

That’s kind of their point thought
