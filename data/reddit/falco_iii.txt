First question is why bitcoin?  Just curious, want some weed, hard drive encrypted?  This will lead you to how much.  For $100 or so, you can use localbitcoins that let you meet other people and trade cash for bitcoins.  Another way is an exchange where you wire them money and then can buy bitcoins.  Exchanges have regulations / anti-money laundering laws that need to be followed, so it can be a pain and take a while.  
The (private key for) coins will be loaded onto a computer or smart phone, and you can spend them from there.  
As for spending, there are many services you can get online, hotels, airfare, flowers, etc...  and a few local places may take bitcoin.

Awesome, we don't need to blast any organization for not supporting segwit because legacy transactions are more "exclusive".  And LN is not needed, because we don't want bitcoin to be like a shitcoin that can transact for cheap.  
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:07:06
Like a crypto that has $20+ fees for any transaction?  The fees are making bitcoin a shitcoin.   Segwit adoption is low (even the reference core wallet does not have it in the UI) and LN is not out, and needs adoption.

2% is still cheaper than bitcoin for anything less than $400  for the last month.  
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:34:59
You have it right - in the last year or so, there are more transactions than room for them on the blockchain, this creates a market for transactions based on the fees attached.  More desired transactions result in higher fees, which have been going up and up.  
Segwit can divide the fees by 4, but has low adoption after 4-5 months and is not available in the reference bitcoin wallet UI.  
Lightning Network could move many transactions off-chain but is not released yet.  
In the meantime, people are moving away from Bitcoin other payment systems (other cryptocurrency or traditional payments) for actually paying for things.

The Tether company promises to make $1 USD available to redeem for each tether unit (USDT), some people and exchanges are treating USDT as equivalent to USD.  
But, if USDT is being created out of thin air and not backed by USD, then there appears to be more "money" (USD) in exchanges than there actually is.   More money going after the same supply means prices go up.  When tether is shown as a fraud, USDT will drop in price and all of that "money" will disappear, causing chaos in crypto markets as about $1 billion USDT has been created.

Up until last month, I only bought, held and spent bitcoin because it was useful as a currency.  
Now, I am basically forced to use other crypto to buy stuff as there's no way I am going to pay $20+ (or $5+ with segwit) in fees to buy something.  So I buy some other crypto, and wind up holding some for future purchases.   
So if I am using another crypto to buy/hold/sell, why do I need bitcoin again?

It takes development resources (development, testing, release) to implement segwit.  They have lots of other things demanding development resources (ever increasing loads on the system, more alt-coins, more ways to deposit/withdraw, etc...) and segwit is just one possible project.  
Plus, LN is supposed to be Real Soon Now^TM and that will also need development resources, so wait and do Segwit+LN is one approach.  
As many segwit supporters stated, segwit is a soft fork that users are not forced to use.  It looks like the community is using that freedom and ~10% adoption is where we are after 5 months.

No.  Some sharp arbitrage will hedge real BTC vs. the futures price when the expiry date nears.  The futures price and the price of bitcoin will merge together at expiry +- a few percent.  Hell there are daily 5+% differences on the major bitcoin exchanges.

Each block can only hold 1 MB worth of transactions, and blocks are created every 10 minutes.  Each transaction has a length in bytes and can attach an optional fee.  If there are more transactions than room in a block it creates a market for fees.  The price in BTC per transaction has gone up over 10x, when combined with the increase in price, the fees get crazy.  
Segwit could help because segwit transactions only count 1/4 th as much as a regular transaction.  The block size could be increased (this is BCH), or transactions could go off network (lightning network).  As it is today, segwit adoption is low after 4 months (~10% of transactions) and LN is not out yet (and needs adoption). 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:49:40
I agree, saying that bitcoin core is "Segwit Ready" is silly.  Segwit is not in the UI for the reference bitcoin wallet.  Why are people hating on other organizations when the people who write the core wallet have not yet provided segwit to end users?

Why is 1 MB ok for decentralization but anything bigger is bad?

@_date: 2017-12-14 16:42:43


No.  Biggest services today are the exchanges and the payment processors for business.  Even if/when LN is available, most people who want to change fiat to bitcoin, or businesses who want to accept bitcoin and recieve fiat will use an exchange and/or payment processor, which will have to decide to support LN, write code to support it (most are not running bitcoin-qt core), test and release it.  And we see how slow the rollout of segwit is going.

The fees are paid to the miner that creates the block that confirms your transaction.  Mining is decentralized around the world.  Once a transaction is secure in the blockchain, it is stored forever on many bitcoin full-nodes.  


It is currently needed otherwise your transaction will have almost 0% chance of being confirmed.  Miners act in their own self interest and mine the tx with the highest fees first.  


Yes, many people are being priced out of using Bitcoin as the fees rise.  People interested in crypto will go to other coins because the literally cannot afford the fees.  People will not  buy anything with bitcoin if it costs $20+ in fees.  
Fees 1 year ago were ~ 25 cents USD.  The price of bitcoin was $1000, so 10x of the increase in fees is due to the price increase (as fees are priced in bitcoin) so $2.50 per transaction would be expected, but more people want in, creating more transactions, making fees higher...

Professional miners need fiat to pay the bills, so they sell a portion of their bitcoin for fiat and use that for operations.  Their selling causes downward pressure on the price of bitcoin as 1800 bitcoins are created per day.   
When the halvening happens, less coins are created but still need to produce the same amount of fiat, so miners will "need" more fiat per bitcoin.  This theoretically could increase the price.  
Note, miner selling has almost no effect in the crazy-coo-coo market we have been in recently.

The blockchain is a global, distributed ledger of all transactions for bitcoin.  Every address used and every transaction is publicly available for anyone to see in the blockchain.  
1. Each block links to the previous block, creating a "chain" of blocks.  It is very, very, very hard to replace older blocks without replacing all blocks that "chain" into it.  
2. Each block is "difficult" to create - it has to meet a certain criteria that will create blocks every 10 minutes on average.  The difficulty changes roughly every 2 weeks as the world wide computing power goes up or down.
3. Each block "confirms" transactions not in any other block by by including them in the current block.  
4. Mining computers that create the a block get a reward (currently 25 BTC) plus any transaction fees. 
5. Because it is difficult to create blocks and older blocks or sections of the blockchain chain cannot easily be replaced, any transaction included in an older block can be trusted.
0 confirmations - unconfirmed.  It is possible to not have the transaction not confirm for a few reasons (double spend, too low transaction fee, transaction malleability).  
1 confirmation - likely confirmed.... unless 2 miners find a block at nearly the same time and one includes the tx and the other does not, and the block without the tx becomes the longer, publicly accepted chain.  
2 + confirmations - very likely confirmed.  
6 confirmations - current standard for "100% confirmed".

The OSI model is a great way to separate and discuss parts of networks and applications in a standardized reference model.  Most people only focus on the first 4 layers, but they have all been used in one way or another.  For example, TCP/IP (layers 3 and 4) run just fine over different layers 2 &amp; 1:  copper based ethernet, wifi or carrier pigeon.

@_date: 2016-01-14 06:26:34
I agree that the ecosystem is immature.  There are 4 parts that make up Bitcoin.    
First is the protocol specification itself, from Satoshi's whitepaper to all of the BIPs implemented and other pieces.  Everything else stems from the spec.  
Second, there are the bitcoin mining software developers.  Yes, just those who are writing software to mine bitcoin.  These people take the specification and make software applications that can be run to create the blockchain.  All blocks (and thus bitcoin) stem from those software apps.  
Third, there are the miners.  These are the people who take the bitcoin mining software of their choice and run it to compete and create the blockchain and thus bitcoin.  
Fourth and finally, there is the ecosystem - everyone &amp; everything else.  These are the people and systems that will take the miner's created bitcoins, pay money &amp; services for them so the miners can pay their bills &amp; profit.  The ecosystem then uses bitcoin as a currency / payment system / egold / gambling platform / etc...  
Now to generalize and pigeon hole IMHO...  
On one side the segwit group is a lot of the core developers (an important group of some of the mining software developers) and a few large organizations from the ecosystem want to implement segregated witness and lightning network to increase speed of transactions and number of transactions possible indirectly (more transactions can happen off chain).  
On the other side the XT/Classic group is a small group of developers, quite a few miners and a lot of the ecosystem that want to simply increase the max blocksize, thus increasing the number of transactions possible.  
So we have two competing camps with code that is (or close to being) ready to run.  
Who gets to say what's in Bitcoin?  In this case, the miners.  The miners will pick the software that is in their best interest to maximize value to themselves - likely through self interest (we profit more with/without segwit or small/large blocks), their thought on the overall value of the bitcoin system (more people will use bitcoin if we choose option X) or some political reason (we hate person X!)  
If the majority of miners picked up one or the other proposed option, most of the ecosystem would willingly / apathetically / grudgingly follow.

True, but they do have a large economic stake in bitcoin.  If they thought it was in their economic best interest, miners and nodes could pay someone to code what they want.  Or, if there was a small group of non-consensus coders already working on code aligned with their interests, they could run their code for free.  


True, most users just want the bitcoin system to work, and don't want to know about the details.  If they perceive the consensus of coders doing something against their economic interests, then they would simply not run that code.

With every other significant change, there has been a "formal" document that covers exactly what the change is.  This looks like it is coded before the spec is written.  
1. Get people to agree to a specification (e.g. increase block size by X after time T if Y percent agree, do this Z times).  
2. Write the spec down so everyone can review and sign up for it.  
3. Code and test.  
4. Go live.  
I am not saying no, just that there needs to be some process - it seems like people are just spitting out code left &amp; right.  
@_date: 2016-01-09 19:37:25
Why?  I run a core full node with low bandwidth (around 1mbit/s), and blocks show up quickly.  Maybe a few seconds after high bandwidth nodes, but everyone has some delay from the miner creating the block to it being verified on your node.  
In fact, if the node has been off for a while, the multi-day catch-up is (crappy) CPU bound, not network bound at 1mbit/s.  
@_date: 2017-03-06 05:08:42


Nope.  If a consensus of coders decided to do something that miners and nodes thought was wrong, they would not run the consensus coder's version.  They would stick with what they have now, and/or run another variant that a non-consensus coder wrote.

Each transaction has a certain size of data.  A typical transaction basically says: "Here's proof I own these bitcoins and I want to send X bitcoins to address Y and the rest to address Z" in a  very specific way. The average transaction is about [600 bytes long]( and a block is currently limited to 1 MB, so at most about [2000 transactions can fit in a block](  Since blocks are created every 10 minutes on average, that gives about 3 transactions per second as the maximum rate of bitcoin transactions.  
These numbers are estimated averages - you could argue slight variations, but the idea still holds.  
To expand capacity, segwit has one approach (and fixes other stuff) and bitcoin unlimited has another - cue the arguments.

No, changes to bitcoin is politics.  Developers, users, 3rd party services, nodes and miners all participate.  Each group and individual has their own agenda.  
The fact that someone has a Math &amp; Computer Science degree with courses in cryptography and networking and has personally contributed to the bitcoin core code does not mean they have more power than others.  


This I agree with, too often people who like one idea start to vilify and attack other ideas and the people who hold those ideas.  For the vast majority, the people on the other side of the debate are good people with good intentions.

First the string - do not share it with anyone.  If the string of lettters begins with a 5 or S and is in this format "5HpHagT65TZzG1PH3CSu63k8DbpvD8s5ip4nEB3kEsreAnchuDf" it is a bitcoin private key and can be imported into a bitcoin wallet and you're done.  If it looks like the address above and has a 1 at the front, it is a public key, and you can type it into blockchain.info to see how much bitcoin is in the address (might be his address, might be a payment he made to someone else).  If it looks like a password (upper, lower and special characters), it could be the password for the wallet and/or the computer.  
Now the computer:  See if you can get onto the computer - try a handful of basic passwords if it's locked (blank / password / admin).  Don't do too many guesses if it has a self-wipe feature.  If that does not work, shutdown, pull the hard drive and put it into your computer and mount it.  This will work as long as there's no disk-encryption.  
Once you are in, try to figure out which [bitcoin wallet]( he was using.  If it was bitcoin core, there will be a file called wallet.dat on the computer.  wallet.dat (plus an optional but frequently used password) and you're done.   The computer used bitcoin mining software, see what software that was and how it was configured.   He likely connected to a mining pool, see if you can find out which mining pool and any address (string starts with 1) or username / pass for the mining pool configured somewhere in the mining software.

A bitcoin wallet can have many, many bitcoin addresses - all valid &amp; able to receive/send bitcoins.  If you generate a new bitcoin address for your wallet and never receive bitcoins to that address, that address is untraceable.  You can generate more addresses at any time and use them for whatever purposes you want.  
The privacy risk is if you receive bitcoins to a reddit-account linked address, and then spend those bitcoins along with other bitcoins at the same time you have now linked both addresses to your reddit account.  Wallets can and do mix different addresses with coins when creating a transaction to spend coins.

Bitcoin/USD 24 hour trading volume is [$248M](  Other currencies could help soften the blow, but some of the trading is algo/day trading/arbitrage that generates large volume with little impact on price.  


It is not the exchanges holding the cash, it is Tether holding the cash.  One single place with very little transparency.  I hope and believe that exchanges are isolated, unless there is a tight relationship between the tether organization and exchange(s).  


Tethers are a great "onramp" to crypto (assuming they are solid).  If tethers go away, that onramp is taken away.  


True.  It is a crypto-currency issue for currencies traded on exchanges that accept tether.  Bitcoin is the largest crypto-currency. 


And a 40% dip would be a bad thing.  People will scream and many people impacted have not even heard of tether.  I think that what people want is certainty and transparency (not FUD).  Tether, please clear up some of these items to increase confidence:  
- no phone number or address listed on the site.  
- no names of anyone who works at tether on the site (CEO, Board, nothing).  
- no audit reports for tether, which has been around for 2 years and claims to have $600,000,000 in the bank.   Only a redacted report from an accounting firm (not an audit).  
Here is an excerpt from the tether whitepaper:  
"...Tethers may be redeemable/exchangeable for the underlying fiat currency pursuant to Tether Limited’s terms of service..."  
However, the terms of service are clearly the opposite:  
Terms of Service Section 2:  
...  
Tethers are not money and are not monetary instruments. They are also not stored value or currency.  
There is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your Tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of Tethers by us for money. There is no guarantee against losses when you buy, trade, sell, or redeem Tethers.  
Section 11 is relevant as well.  
Googling does not show a clear picture of who is in charge at tether or works there.  
I would encourage those in charge of transparency at Tether to actually provide some information.

There are 5 groups involved with bitcoin:  
Developers write the code.  
Miners run the code to generate bitcoins.  
Nodes run the code to make the bitcoin network.  
Holders pay for mined bitcoins giving them "fiat value".  
Companies provide an ecosystem.  
A person / entity could be more than 1 type.  
Miners and holders can "vote" on the blockchain through which type/version of blocks get mined and creating a "vote transaction" attached to a number of bitcoins.  
Nodes can vote by running different software and can be counted via network analysis.  
Developers and Companies can publicly state their vote.  
The problem is there's no way to say what % of which groups should determine the future of Bitcoin, and how do you weight each developer or company?

AUtomated support was a joke, contacting support said "Thank you for submitting your request. Due to increased volume it may take several days to receive a response."  
Exchanges come &amp; go, people are in different countries, AML/KYC rules change.  It took weeks for me to get fully setup the first time I bought bitcoin, I expect that friction to the bitcoin onramp has stopped a number of people.

Guessed 80 sat/bye as there were 800 transactions with 80+ sat/byte at the time and ~2100 transactions / full block.  Many more transactions flooded in with high fees, was not picked up in the first block and now 120 sat/byte transactions are filling the mempool.

Yesterday sent $100 to my friend as her first transaction with bread wallet (one address only).  She went to spend $20 and the unchangeable fee was $2.45.  Fees need to come down, I thought Segwit would help by now?

Because as soon as you sell, it will go even higher.  


Because as soon as you buy, it dips even lower.  If you buy more you will soon get tapped out on a falling knife and then you have to hodl for a good long time to get back to your average purchase price.

You are wrong and wrote a click-bait title without understanding the technology involved.  
Take a look at the [flow in BIP-70.]  
(  The customer's wallet generates the transaction and sends it to the bitcoin network and the payment processor (bitpay).  This will help stop man-in-the-middle attacks, automatically provide a "refund address" in case a refund is needed, and remove the short delay for the TX to be shared with enough nodes for the payment processor's node to see it.

There was one  &lt; $2 but &gt; $1, and three &lt; $1.  
I tried the largest 2, the last 2, the largest and two others added together.  After 3 or 4 tries I go the "you tried too many times" error.  
How else can I verify or how can you help?  I contacted their support and received the auto-response "Due to increased volume it may take several days to receive a response."  
My point is the onramp to bitcoin is quite rocky with lots of bumps that could stop newbies from getting into bitcoin.   
Combine with the fact that exchanges pop up and go out of business, exchanges add and remove countries they work with and exchanges change the way to deposit &amp; withdraw funds.

If you go shopping at any of the retail stores (Target/Gap/toys-r-us/Home-Depot etc...) and don't know how much you will spend, it was convenient to shop normally.  Before you want to head to the checkout line do a quick mental sum and order the Gyft card.  By the time you have to pay, the gift card for most of the purchase has already arrived.  Always order the Gyft card for less than the actual amount and pay a bit with cash, as having virtual gift cards with a small remainder is a pain.  Waiting an average of 10 minutes makes this plan painful.

1. They don't understand it.  The unknown is scary.  When you explain it, it shakes their core because they need to question "what is money" and "why do we accept government money"?  
2. They think its a scam.  A lot of unusual financial ideas are scams, and the bitcoin ecosystem has had its share of scams and scandals.

Create a business case.  Do some legwork to see what the price to really buy bitcoins in Egypt and sell for your fiat are.  Do this 4 times across 2 weeks.  Compare the savings to paypal's fees.  Assuming it is compelling, present the boss with the data.  Be prepared to have a plan in place to implement if asked to.  
Quick google only found 1 legitimate looking option to buy in Egypt - uses western union.

You are wrong. The win-payout transaction that sends you back the winning bitcoins depends on your bet transaction - if your bet transaction is ruled as a double spend, then the win payout transaction must also be invalid.  
1. You create a transaction to send your bitcoins (verified inputs) to a satoshi dice bet address (output).  You send this to the bitcoin network, unverified at the time.  
2. Your unverified output is now used as an unverified input by SD.  If you win, SD uses the unverified input you sent and other verified bitcoins (house bitcoins) back to you in a win-payout.  This adds the win-payout transaction to the transaction chain that has your bet transaction on it, win-payout can ONLY be a valid transaction if the bet transaction is valid.  
3.  If you successfully double spend the original bet transaction bitcoins, then the bet transaction AND the win-payout transaction are invalid.

Old-time bitcoiner here... tried this out to see what it would be like for friends &amp; family...
Received .0007 BTC - about $0.10.  Nice.  
The site easily helped me send .0001 to a facebook friend who has a small online store, encouraging him to accept bitcoins.  Not sure how it works with him not having a wallet, but still nice.
Other .0006 went to a coinbase account it helped me setup.  Ok great so far.  
Decided coinbase is ok, but is not for me and wanted to send it to my wallet... mandatory .0005 transaction fee, yikes!

Many possible reasons:  
It is an automated trading scheme using spread filling.  
If the spread is 123 bid / 124 ask, then post trades at 123.01 buy and 123.99 sell so they are at the "top" of the order book.  If both trades are executed, it is 0.98 profit.  
It could be someone wanting to dollar-cost buy into / out of bitcoins,

Sometimes it goes too high and won't come back down lower to get more bitcoins - just like real life.
