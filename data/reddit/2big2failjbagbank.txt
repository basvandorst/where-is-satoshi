one issue i have is that both trezor and ledger have the ability to keep records on  you and they say that they don't but i don't trust them.

a hardware wallet that seems safer and better to me at least then trezor and ledger because trezor and ledger have some weak points in their security.  see the comments by user Aussiehash in this post.

Its easy to blame banks this faceless entity.  But we all know who runs the banks and it is in fact the Jews.  This isn't an anti semitic statement so much as it is factual.  Furthermore the Jewish Banking system ran itself into the ground by giving out loans they could never pay back to primarily non whites in 2008.  Then after failing at banking the Jewish Banks got bailed out by White America.  Another harsh fact but true if you actually look at who got loaned this money.  The USA literally rewarded bad economic behavior.
