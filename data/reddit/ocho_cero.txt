The SEC is technically part of the executive branch, and even though not technically under the president's control, Trump knows about this and if he wants it to be approved, it will be. 
I think the announced delay by the SEC last month was done at least partly to allow for this transfer of power to occur first.

Maybe it's in response to feedback they've received, something they needed to touch on in order to get it done.

Throw it all out the window now. It's 2017 and Trump will get this done. He wants this to happen on his watch. He's all about financial independence, privacy, limited regulations, etc. And he has an enormous ego. When this all gets huge in the future he'll get to say he was the president that opened the gates, even if doesn't understand what it is. Trump will decide what the SEC does. It's Trump's America now, for better or worse.

Probably no real pressure, but if SEC knows it is going to deny, it will often give the applicant the ability to withdraw the filing rather than have an outright disapproval issued. 
In this case, the SEC dragged this out as long as they possibly could and the twins just kept the pace to the bitter end. And even if they were given the opportunity to withdraw in advance, they made the SEC say no to their face. Respect

Props to the Winklevoss brothers for sticking it out to the end and making these pussies disapprove rather than withdrawing.

I think these guys are going to get rewarded for the years of dues they have been paying. That's just my gut, could be totally wrong, we'll see.
SEC is serious, sure, but so are these brothers. They're paying the lawyers all these years because they think they can get this shit done and make history. I'm pulling for them.

Do your old man proud for once and hodl that shit.

You've been hodling for years, so clearly you don't need the cash. Just sit on that little nest egg. Just until 2020. You can do it.
