So, let's say, for example, I'm going to go ahead and audit MtGox, and figure out who owns what, and probably need to completely rewrite most their trading platform, to say nothing of their wallet implementation (obviously).
Care to explain why you, person who lost money on MtGox, ought to share in the revenue such a trading platform generates? What entitles you to that?
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:17:03
Yes! If you had assets with MtGox, and were wondering if you'd ever recover them, you now have closure and some clarity there.
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:15:47
It doesn't really follow. Why should having money tied up in MtGox entitle anyone to partial ownership of this hypothetical exchange?

Just a reminder, after reading this little nugget in the first paragraph:


(Emphasis mine.)
For currency withdrawals, those are backlogged for over one month for yen at this point (which as I understand it is/was the fastest withdrawal method), so they aren't "allowing" currency withdrawals either - they're affected by another issue.

Well, it's different. The police can detain you for longer and with less cause, but they *tend not to*. Tokyo is not unique in having an ordinance like that, either.
And they will not, for example, detain you for 18 hours "looking for drugs" and not finding any while a doctor repeatedly rapes you, like they do in the US. So they might not be terribly democratic and free, but they are far from the worst offenders in this regard.

Yes, but what makes you a 'shareholder' in this new exchange? Presumably you would pay something or give up something or do *something* to become a shareholder. What is that? Losing money on MtGox? That doesn't really cut it, because the operator of this new exchange isn't going to see that money either.
What possible reason does anyone have to give you any profits from this new exchange, rather than keep it for themselves?
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:55:39
The weather is fine in Tokyo today, and was fine yesterday. I'm sure this won't stop them from using it as an excuse (for the next month), but the weather was only bad on Saturday.

Hold onto it! The value can only go up!
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:32:01
Well, exactly. They don't gain anything, even customers. I guess they get a mailing list of people who recently lost some arbitrary sum of money, from a little bit to a staggering amount, most of whom are probably not interested in buying BTC soon (or can't). Then, I don't know, they give a portion of their profits to these people?
It would be charity, no matter how low the percentage. Nothing more.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:02:06
It's not like that at all though, any more than depositing money in a bank entitles you to partial ownership of a bank, or buying stock entitles you to partial ownership of an exchange, or for that matter buying a cheeseburger entitles you to partial ownership of a McDonald's.
Who is going to take the time to audit MtGox? Who is going to rewrite their entire trading engine and wallet implementation? And, once they have done these things, what possible reason do they have to share the fruits of that labor with someone who lost money in MtGox? They're never going to see that money, either. It's gone.
I mean, you're right that, if you had shares in this new exchange, it would be in your best interest that the exchange succeed. But, that's not particularly novel. If I gave you shares in General Motors, it would be in your best interest that General Motors succeed as well - but that doesn't mean you're entitled to shares in General Motors.

This is not correct. I've had a pending withdrawal for nearly one month. As far as I know (and I've asked around) no one has had a JPY withdrawal go through that was initiated after the first half of January.
You know, because of the New Year holidays.

The depth on either side is rather high (just judging from experience) and volume is very low because the market is mostly bears and hoarders.
There has been a lot of talk about how so many people are using bitcoins now, but I find it hard to believe that's the case. You mention a "wall" and while there is a wall, it is a wall of minimum volume - it doesn't seem to go below 20K. Two weeks ago, volume seemed to flatten at 40K. That number may continue to drop. I don't know how much of that is still speculation and how much is being used for transactional stuff, but even if all 20K is purely non-speculative (unlikely IMO), that indicates the things are very overpriced right now. Like, order-of-magnitude overpriced. In that case hoarders will bit-by-bit decide to liquidate their position and you will be able to buy the things for a reasonable price again. Last time it took 5 months. This time, it may take a year.

So, what makes you think they are worth $130, professor?
@_date: 2013-06-02 10:41:33
Average daily volume on MtGox prior to the sell got down to around 5k. Because, nobody is using them other than as speculative instruments, and most speculators have lost their money by now.
How are you going to structure a 20k transaction around that, in a way that doesn't take several days on the market that will often swing 50% down then up over the course of a few hours?

This is merely the late stages of any YC-funded startup: litigation and bedwetting. Didn't they get hacked a few months ago? Mt. Gox was right not to trust them with their data.

Didn't someone try to live for a week on bitcoins about a month ago, and fail miserably? No there is not a "Bitcoin economy". Bitcoin has some usefulness as a shared ledger for moving fiat around. It would be more useful if the price were not so volatile.
Are you being paid for your work, and in turn paying your rent, your utilities, and buying groceries, with bitcoins? Is anybody?
edit: And, when the volume was very high, everyone was screaming how Bitcoin was a multi billion-dollar economy and had come much closer to  achieving mass acceptance. So, now that volume is low, it means the same thing?

Hacker News (discussion forum for Y-Combinator which funded CoinLab) is zealously deleting any threads started to discuss this topic. They regularly surpress discussion of topics that might make them, or the companies they've funded, look bad. So, I think it's probably legit. The $75 million, on the other hand (if that's what you meant) is of course fine-cut bullshit.
I wouldn't worry too much about Mt. Gox. They have shitloads of money. All CoinLab has is SV hype courtesy of Paul Graham and his merry band of VC hooligans.

I suspect a lot of bitcoins are being mined with stolen electricity. If that becomes common enough, it will be impossible to mine coins legitimately and turn any profit.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:25:19
There was no money lost. It only changed hands.
@_date: 2013-04-19 15:37:23
This is a rather naive understanding of how a market works. According to you the price of any tradeable instrument should go up over a long enough span of time, when clearly that is not the case. Sure, people would love to buy coins at $50 *now*, because they could immediately turn around and sell them for over twice that. It would be a sure thing. What about when the price drops down to $50 again? You going to buy then? Are you sure the price won't continue to drop down to $10 and then stay there for *years* before there is any kind of recovery?
Do you know what all this volatility means? It doesn't mean lots of people want to get their hands on bitcoin. It doesn't mean they are on the cusp of another meteoric rise. It means *nobody knows what these fucking things are actually worth*. That's the opposite of confidence, regardless of the price it's trading at. And for something like Bitcoin, if it persists long enough, it becomes more likely that the market will decide they are worth *nothing*. A volatile market for bitcoin doesn't make them worthless, but it certainly doesn't help, either.
Mind you I don't think that's going to happen. Long term, I am optimistic about their chances for success. I think this because I believe the blockchain concept is one of the most innovative ideas of the last ten years, and because I think bitcoin can have great utility as a means of settling transactions for far less cost than anything else available (seriously - compare the cost and hassle of sending someone $10000 in bitcoin vs. sending that kind of money via wire transfer). And I think that probably your coins that you are proud to say are worth three times what they were a month ago, will be worth much more than that. But before that they may also be worth about 1/10th what they are now, too.
I don't own any Bitcoins right now, because they are toxic as hell.
@_date: 2013-06-02 15:13:25
Well... yes. At that price and quantity, and given the amount of time we're talking about (at least a day)... yes.
@_date: 2013-06-02 15:16:29
Well, given that this "market" seems to have trouble making up it's mind on this, I was curious why $130.

Considering that, on this subreddit, all news is taken as a reason to buy bitcoins, I think my post is going to be downvoted.
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:00:51
Nothing wrong with cutting your losses early. Even if you are long-term bullish on Bitcoin, holding them while the price is trending downwards is not rational. A market does price discovery faster if its participants are rational. Clearly, at the moment most of the participants in the bitcoin market are not rational.
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:15:41
Exactly. Bitcoins are still worthless bits priced in hashpower. They were headed for the teens anyway.

Just sharing my thoughts, dude. Sorry I interrupted the circlejerk. Carry on.
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:38:00
I don't know what price a bitcoin is going to 'settle' on. I do know that during the period of low volume a few days ago where the price didn't move much, there seemed to be a floor to the volume seen on Mt Gox of about 40K BTC. Of that, if I'm being *very* generous, I guess about half of it is still speculation, and the other half is (or is backed by) actual transactions of actual goods/services (or tips).
So that's 40K BTC * ~$140 / BTC = $5.6 million in transactions daily involving BTC, optimistically.
Bitcoin is a terrible store of value right now, and people are starting to catch on to this fact, and cash out. Not everyone will get the message, but many will I guess. But, assuming they *all* did, and assuming that for 'legit' (i.e. not speculative) transactional purposes you would need to hold the things for about a day, and further assuming that there are about 2.5 million BTC in circulation (many of the early wallets are probably lost and have not been used for years), I calculate that a price of $5.6 / 2.5 BTC, or $2.24 / BTC, is the minimum price required for Bitcoin to work for transactions only.
So the question then is, at what price between that and the current price, will speculation hold the value of a bitcoin reasonably steady? I don't know the answer to that question, but $84 seems high.
Is this crazy and complicated?
@_date: 2013-04-23 10:33:46


No it doesn't, that's a sunk cost. Miners will adjust the effort they expend to mine coins based on the current price of a bitcoin, not the other way around.
