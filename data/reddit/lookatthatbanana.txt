You can try betsofbitco.in its a statement betting site. Minimum .1BTC bets and they're weighted so you won't earn as much betting now than if you did a while ago. 
I used to gamble there over a year ago and stopped when bitcoin price went up making a minimum worth $60 today.  my last bet is finally ending tomorrow with the best picture statement. Hopefully wolf of wall street loses!

Really? I used to use it a lot and I've cashed out a few times. I'll admit though I haven't used it in a while but after my last statement ends tomorrow I'll be done for good. That's a shame I did pretty good there in the past.

From the sidebar:
Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
