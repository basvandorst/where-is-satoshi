That's the problem though. The people regulating fiat have hundreds of years of experience to explain why they make the changes they do. 
Everyone gets all wet when they hear deregulation and free market, but the reason our economy is so stable is because of regulation. Having an unregulated currency completely dependant on  market forces is a recipe for large bubbles and massive recessions.

That's what happens when you live beyond your means regardless of currency. Greece wanted all the nice infrastructure prosperous nations have, without the economy to back it up. Has nothing to do with their currency, which is the Euro...

It's not being adopted though. People aren't buying anything with it, they are just speculating that it will go up. Add to the fact that governments are going to try to control crypto, I just don't see it being viable until major advances happen.

That's the problem though. If it really is the next currancy the world trades on, why isn't it acting like a currency? The whole point of it is to be stable and freely available, allowing people more control over their money. 
But it doesn't do any of those correctly, wild fluctuations, large transaction costs and almost no traditional businesses accept it.

If OP didn't blab his mouth constantly about how much he was making off bitcoin. His coworkers wouldn't be giving him shit now, OP is a little thin skinned.

It's fun making things up.

The economy easily allows for both. Wal-Mart is one if the most successful retailers and the specifically peddle cheap and fast. Or all these Chinese businesses manufacturing cheap crap that consistently outsells and is more profitable than American made goods. 
Honda and Toyota were once seen as cheap, crappy brands. But they continued to improve until now they outsell and consistently rate better than most American brands, even those that used to stake themselves on quality.

Paying customers that aren't paying? Until bitcoin is so popular that businesses begin losing customers because they don't accept bitcoin. It's on the customers to pay transaction fees

Technical analysis of what? Bitcoin doesn't have anything you can historically compare it to, in order to make these predictions. Add to the fact that it's not currently an effective currency due to instability and it's massive rise is based purely on speculation.  The fact you state you have technical analysis to predict what will happen is a fucking joke.

What value does it have if you can't use it for anything?

What's the incentive for them to do that though?
