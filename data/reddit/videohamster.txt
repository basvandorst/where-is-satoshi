What is: "+bitcointip 3 mBTC"?

I envy you.
I actually had the opposite case where I sold all my BTC yesterday at 98.5, and decided not to buy more even when I saw the price got to 110.
Now I feel like I've missed the train, and I'm not so sure that the price will go back to 90 anytime soon...

No more day-trading for me.
I took all my BTC out of MtGox and Bitstamp and moved it to a wallet where I won't be able to make spur of the moment.

Nice vid,
But the background beeps made me think someone was intruding my house (-;

At the moment my chances of actually using it as a currency are slim, as I live in Israel, and not many merchants are accepting it.
Ordering online could have been a good solution, but the customs in Israel are a greedy bunch of assholes, and I would end up paying double the amount it's worth.
Only thing I can do is to trade in the currency itself, although there are fees for that as well applied by my bank.

Feeliing so too...
I think I'll be cashing my BTC for now until the market stabilize a bit
Good night!

Yep, that's pretty much how it worked for me.
I managed to sell twice at 60$, when I was sure it's going to go down to 30$.
Instead, it climbed back to 70$ and I was left feeling like an idiot...rightfully

Had split account on both MtGox and Bitstamp at the time...
