What dip are you talking about? I got in Oct/Nov and saw only two major dips, during Christmas holidays and now. It's not a FUD, I am just curious, because I am quite new in the crypto world - what makes you think that this dip is not the last one? Can you tell it just because dips happened in the past?

"Media spreading FUD about banning bitcoin in INDIA. Actual words by finance minister “The government does not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender or coin, and will take all measures to curb the use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or any part of payment systems,” .
Wrong interpretation: Bitcoin is illegal. Correct interpretation: Bitcoin cannot be used as legal tender. Bitcoin cannot be used for illegitimate activities.
The video of FM speaking is at the end of the article here : 
Taken from another subreddit. Maybe this is some of the FUD causing yet another dip. I'm not tripping just yet.
