I'm curious as to how other countries rank. 
Does someone know of a source that has data on more countries?

I recommend watching [this]( video, it's not too technical and goes over what exactly is done in mining cryptocurrenies.

Which is when somebody will make qBitcoins or qCoins.

There can only ever be 21 million Bitcoin in existence, meaning a theoretical maximum of 10.5 million people can ever own 2 Bitcoin at the same time. 10.05 million can be approximately 10 million, so roughly speaking the 10 million club is the club of the 10 million people that can have 2 Bitcoin.

If the price of Bitcoin didn't increase between your buy and sell, you'd pay no capital gains tax. Otherwise, you'd only pay on the profit you've made on that particular amount of Bitcoin.

Putting it on GitHub and waiting for pull requests would be a good idea for stuff like that.

That mean the money people earn won't be circulated as much, which would be terrible for any economy.

Do you think it's gonna drop further?

Doesn't that mean that deflation, and therefore Bitcoin, discourages spending due to the fact that not spending would increase the value of your money.
What pros and cons does would a theoretical society that has a deflating economy as opposed to an inflating one, as opposed to an inflating economy like ours?

Do you think it's gonna drop further?
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:00:46
Yup, this is just an opportunity to buy!
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:23:49
Guess it's gonna do down. Everyone sell!

If you're in it for the long term, it's not going to be 'too late' for a while.

$100 containing rfid chips in them is a myth.
If they did, microwaving them would make the location of the chip clear. However, as shown in [this]( video, microwaving them does does not affect them.
@_date: 2018-07-10 17:53:56
Has there been any information about the development of rfid embedded currency, or even any sign of interest in development in the near future?

Doesn't the money they make on ad revenue far outweigh the amount they give out?

Does anyone have any recommendations for how to best store bitcoin? Preferably without having to buy something to do so, like for a hardware wallet.
Also, how would one minimise transfer fees when moving bitcoin out of an exchange?
