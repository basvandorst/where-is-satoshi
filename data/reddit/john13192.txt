 Well, Lightning Network isn’t launched for Bitcoin yet. It’s obvious that the site doesn’t list this feature for Binance. Everybody knows that LN will speed up transactions but not now. Hope that the community will launch Lightning Network as soon as possible, so we can make really quick and cheap deals. To learn more, be sure to check a few sources, not only those related to Binance. Subscribe to Cointelegraph or CoinDesk, check listings on different exchanges like CEX where you can buy bitcoins for fiats: r/

 Actually, it is not. It's just another type of slavery and addiction

 Hmm… Bitcoin memes, love it :)  Some holders (including me) are actually THAT proud of having btc. Sure, it was easier to be proud when it cost was about 20k. Maybe soon it will even reach 50k or 100k. The fun is just beginning.

 Bitcoin mustn’t be the reason for being stressed! Fiats inflation is way more stressful. So, thic picture is not that illustrative for the current state of the community. No worries, especially if you're holding Bitcoin and considering it to be a long-term investment.

 The picture emphasizes that even technical analysis and math can’t predict the behavior of the market. The figures and indicators are efficient for certain situations, but the problem is there are no identical situations on the market. The outside insignificant factor interferes and makes all predictions based on math invalidate. Especially, the crypto market is subject to any piece of news and instantly shows it on graphics.
