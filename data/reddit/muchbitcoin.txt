A protocol similar to the internet's that uses an immutable public ledger to transfer tamper-proof ownership of digital data. Like the internet it is fast, distributed, open, border-less, permission-less, trust-less and owner-less.

@_date: 2014-09-29 04:08:26
Aw, it got blocked. Anyone know how to make it not get blocked?
@_date: 2014-12-11 03:56:30
I don't have/see bitcoin option
@_date: 2014-08-16 22:14:14

As a Canadian, I am in the same boat. Although, TigerDirect finally let their Canadian site accept bitcoin
@_date: 2014-09-29 04:59:30
Woot, thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:48:40
As far as I know, they haven't released the claim form to us yet.
@_date: 2014-05-17 16:05:14
that's a shame, if true :(

Where in Vancouver is this?
@_date: 2014-08-16 18:52:57
Ill be out for a few hours. Ill check back here when im back.
@_date: 2014-10-20 03:32:34

@_date: 2014-09-29 04:07:52
Aw, it got blocked

People can register now! Two generous people have registered so far!
@_date: 2015-05-14 01:36:13
We will all find out...later

Normal people might not have to have interest. It's been asked whether consumers or institutions (the professionals) will lead adoption. (or maybe something inbetween?) 
@_date: 2014-08-16 22:14:34
Thanks :)

Sorry to see you guys go - if this is true :)

Isn't digital scarcity new? It can't be duped. The double spend issue that plagued anything digital until now. I think there are some other things too..
@_date: 2015-08-02 18:24:40
I politely disagree with your statement or I misunderstood what you are trying to say.

I've built an educational website ( if anyone is interested. Feel free to let me know of any improvements as I am always working to make it better.
@_date: 2016-10-21 05:33:24
Feel free to check out this educational website I built! 
@_date: 2016-10-22 23:14:54
See if this website will help you ;) 
@_date: 2015-03-21 21:34:21
That looks like a deathchain
@_date: 2015-11-01 02:44:39
This must be invented!
@_date: 2015-11-03 15:40:42
what changed from before?
@_date: 2015-03-12 01:09:42
I thought it was just getting started
@_date: 2015-03-09 03:15:26
Fraud is not hitting consumers directly...but indirectly in the end, i'm not so sure.
@_date: 2015-10-04 14:05:51
Actually, it was the opposite. Napster needed to be decentralised so that it could not be shutdown.
@_date: 2015-11-02 02:10:26
Interesting, thanks hendrixski!

Not with Bitcoin blockchain???
@_date: 2015-03-14 15:16:37
I don't think so
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:34:29
Also getting errors randomly..
@_date: 2015-11-05 02:13:19
It isn't over yet
@_date: 2015-11-01 14:30:55
so are these poor people all buying bitcoin just to send money to this or did they already have bitcoin? I don't know much about MMM but I read that bitcoin is one of many payment methods. Just curious as to if these people are really using bitcoin over the other payments (educating themselves, buying the bitcoin and then sending it - opposed to using something they were already familiar with)

I've also paid via scanning qr code and the video is still showing a loading symbol :(
@_date: 2015-02-14 07:21:27
A Bitcoinaire?
