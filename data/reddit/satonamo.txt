I personally think the ledger nano S would be magnitudes better.
@_date: 2016-04-27 04:11:06
Woah. This came out of the dark. Really like the new UI.
@_date: 2016-04-10 10:27:49
That suits SpaceX lol.
Jk. Looks so freaking awesome.

I'm an old vultr user. I won't have any issues right?
@_date: 2016-04-26 09:12:50
Haven't heard of this since Mike hearn. People gonna hate and potatoes gonna potate.
@_date: 2016-04-27 04:07:09
It was the first thing I heck this morning as I woke up.

Keep calm and wait.Their support is extremely good and the go out of their way to help you. Just wait.
@_date: 2016-04-16 05:40:43
I'm not trying to snub you, but this doesn't help at all. 
@_date: 2016-04-06 13:51:29
But they still don't send be 2FA when I want to login.
@_date: 2016-04-30 14:46:55
Tbh...he doesn't need the attention he gets. He just got lucky and made a lot of money. He says that bitcoin can't stop wars(idk why) but he himself was jailed for selling guns or something on eBay.
He jut doesn't understand things and neither should anyone pay attention.
@_date: 2016-04-21 03:49:36
It has already been implemented. Not for mobile though.
@_date: 2016-03-29 02:10:37
Hardware wallets are the best. They can't be replaced.
@_date: 2016-03-17 12:16:43
Do you think that's going on right now? At @_date: 2016-03-09 13:55:31
It's in the roadmap. Don't worry.(coming soon)
@_date: 2016-03-05 03:52:38
Yes please, a consumer oriented demo would be much more helpful.
@_date: 2016-03-17 07:32:08
Do you want open discussion or censorship?
@_date: 2016-03-12 17:03:49
I really like the depth. Please create more content. It's amazing. You should try publishing it (text) at 21.co and you could earn a decent amount.
@_date: 2016-03-17 16:00:36
Phillipines? Right?
@_date: 2016-03-07 15:38:02
Same here, it always happens
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:03:53
IMHO, there was no need to study. Right now there are quite a few solutions to use bitcoin without understanding hire it works.
@_date: 2016-01-27 03:40:58
I didn't mean to ask you. Thanks anyways :)
@_date: 2016-01-25 13:06:42
Awesome, just can't wait to store passwords in my trezor. Official announcement ETA?
@_date: 2016-01-31 14:12:12
This is pretty much useless.
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:57:18
He created JavaScript, which is on the rise better than ever. That is ideally, someone bitcoin can be associated with.
@_date: 2016-03-31 08:09:41
Half of the phones that people currently use don't have NFC capabilities.

Great job!
@_date: 2016-03-02 16:01:56
Thanks a lot. Though the use is limited to a few phones, what you're doing is truly amazing.
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:00:09
I love Copay. But whenever I try to import my trezor, I get an error.
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:11:32
What's your irl name sire?
@_date: 2016-06-14 04:49:46
Enlarge the girls image ffs. It's wonderful to see these memes.
@_date: 2016-06-13 06:17:33
Mate, that's an excellent comparison. How'd you identify it?
@_date: 2016-06-14 04:51:46
I recently switched to Copay after a minor importing struggle. Since then, it's been swift.
@_date: 2016-06-09 04:14:06
Omfg. They're early pioneers now?
They're a piece of shit who haven't done a thing to improve the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2016-06-20 01:36:54
Lol. Don't get too excited my friend. Nobody can predict what happens to the price if BTC. Nobody………
@_date: 2016-06-14 04:50:43
Wasn't Vinny who tweeted that stability will be at 675 ot something?
@_date: 2016-06-13 06:12:22
If only my dad believed me and bought btc at $370 a piece. Argh
@_date: 2016-06-20 16:59:01
Yessir. Always there to support trezor. xD
@_date: 2016-06-14 04:48:27
I laughed for real xD.
@_date: 2016-06-18 01:53:22
Trezor is magnitudes better as compared to KeepKey which is just a ripoff(for now) of the trezor. They say they'll release new features which haven't materialised yet(the KeepKey folks)
They seem to be doing bad business which is why they reduced the price for $239 to somewhere around $100
@_date: 2016-11-05 12:15:14
Ez $100,000
Idk. But it will rise
@_date: 2016-11-08 03:04:06
@_date: 2016-02-13 04:16:20
Damm...I already own a couple of those. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 04:42:41
Nobody stores 'lots' of bitcoins on mycelium. Buy a trezor / ledger ASAP
@_date: 2016-02-02 12:28:50
This clearly took a lot of time. Great job OP
@_date: 2016-02-17 14:45:14
Oh my god............!

@_date: 2016-02-13 10:32:39
BitPay ain't that rich. They have a few layoffs, pivoted their pricing model etc.
@_date: 2016-02-10 02:36:25
I don't think so, 21 was in the research phase that that time. They were trying to discover new ways of mining coins at a cheap price and stuff.
@_date: 2016-02-06 10:29:52
PayPal might be new money, but not the best. :P
@_date: 2016-02-05 12:53:06
Liquidity will decrease volatility.
More traders will decrease volatility.
@_date: 2016-02-20 17:40:30
Companies? So you can consult them? Chain.com, Gem.co
@_date: 2016-02-13 10:36:27
Well, I take back my words then. Bitpay should try this. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 17:41:12
Shed get worthless testnet coins :p
@_date: 2016-02-07 09:03:03
I don't think it'll become successful. Maybe a couple hundred publishers will start using their platform. What we really need is an open source, 0% commission, infrastructure that is built right on top of bitcoin and adheres to regulations. We don't want to be dependant on companies like SatoshiPay. Publishers should be independent.
@_date: 2016-02-21 10:31:30
Link to password manager?
@_date: 2016-02-09 18:04:49
I don't think it was possible back then in 2013.
@_date: 2016-02-29 03:10:24
If the wiki is correct the probability of the network accepting an incorrect address is 1 in 2^32 which is roughly 1 in 4.29 billion
@_date: 2016-02-14 14:01:32
Same here. Security stands higher than looks for me.
@_date: 2016-02-11 12:04:12
I sense potential for a new company to facilitate this. I thought Gemini would be able to do some good by being that one trustworthy exchange institutional investors want.
@_date: 2016-02-13 02:56:59
What about the ledger nano and hw1? 
@_date: 2016-02-08 08:16:38
I'm pretty sure you haven't read the article. It is an excellent insight. Nowhere does the author mention that bitcoin needs to be centralised. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 03:02:25
He's a pure genius though. I've seen all of his talks on YouTube and they are extremely informative. 21 Inc is truly disruptive.
@_date: 2016-02-07 09:06:08
IMHO, people like balaji srinivasan and the Cornell researchers(who proposed bitcoin-ng) should go too.
@_date: 2016-02-21 15:49:12
What about the official one?
@_date: 2016-02-09 13:24:49
I'm not sure, but I think that's the plan. I guess I read a couple desk article stating this as well.
They have built he infrastructure that we can also use to monetise APIs. So, now, free APIs can make a couple hundred satoshis per API call(or lesser). This will create the much needed closed loop of bitcoin transactions. 
Effectively, with the 21 bitcoin computer, every Satoshi becomes valuable.
@_date: 2016-02-10 02:35:39
Yes, businesses will try to tackle this. However, they will benefit by this system as they can penetrate deeper into the market due to dirt cheap costs..so now, nobody will be frugal and will willingly buy some stuff for $0.02
@_date: 2016-02-20 17:37:59
Every country should implement this: a secure chip with a public-private key pair for all things:login,voting,taxes,identification etc.
@_date: 2016-02-08 03:03:58
Thank you for taking my opinion into consideration.
Here's the researcher from Cornell.
@_date: 2016-02-08 04:41:37
That was really cool. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 02:00:19
Though it's not exactly like micropayments(in the context of bitcoin) it sure it a good step in the right direction. Visa Europe even posted an article saying that 'bitcoin and blockchain are inevitable'
@_date: 2016-02-20 01:54:28
Yes, blockchain van be used in reducing account ting, auditing and recordkeeping costs.
@_date: 2016-02-09 06:59:41
I really think 21 Inc is the bravest attempt to bring bitcoin mainstream. Every device will become a miner(phone, laptop, pc, etc) and generate a small stream of satoshis which can be used anywhere. Instead of paying for subscriptions monthly/yearly, we can pay per minute of usage, per use, etc.
Use it for in game goods etc.
@_date: 2016-02-16 07:18:18
There exists an email paywall based on the coinbase API.
@_date: 2016-02-19 07:44:49
Hilarious title lol 
@_date: 2016-02-06 13:16:33
I meant 'money' with respect to what was in the advertisement.
@_date: 2016-02-16 07:16:42
Bitfury is 16nm
@_date: 2016-02-03 10:31:49
I don't know why, but its quite weird. Do they want to digitalize every payment(so is this a barrier forcing us to do that).......or what?
@_date: 2016-02-03 07:17:29
That's true. The CEO was recently inducted into PayPal's board members as well.
@_date: 2016-02-03 03:18:08
I share the same curiosity. However, I don't think they will comment on this.
@_date: 2016-02-10 14:09:40
Lol.....bitcoin is not illegal in India as mentioned in the article. It's dead space, no regulation as of now.
@_date: 2016-02-03 06:08:25
I don't think it's anything new in particular. They have a history of being silent(not disclosing plans, views, etc)
@_date: 2016-02-09 10:42:46
21Inc is has raised ~$121 mn USD.
Their CEO has a BS, MS, and PhD from Stanford university. Other leadership is well qualified as well. IMHO, a lot of their plans are still under wraps and the chip that they've built is just the beginning.
As for the pizza that you mentioned. Let me counter that with bitcoin itself.
If you want to increase the price of bitcoin, don't increase the price of 1 BTC. Instead, increase the price of a Satoshi. This is exactly what 21 is doing. They're creating a new micro economy.
@_date: 2016-05-14 16:22:17
Tldr: failed blockchain tech.
@_date: 2016-05-04 23:49:55
@_date: 2016-05-24 17:13:41
Keep calm. There will be a solution for this.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:29:29
We are all Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-02 18:19:50
Thanks a ton for this explanation, I was looking for this.
@_date: 2016-05-04 23:47:31
+1 I was looking for the link. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-05-31 12:41:31
Every bit of what they spoke was just too meaningful.
@_date: 2016-05-07 14:46:01
I don't know about the background but I know one thing:He's a liar. There's simply no reason he had to back out.
@_date: 2016-05-29 14:13:14
Does he have the power to turn the market lmao? 
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:29:06
Can anyone explain the signature stuff in detail please? I know a little but I want to dive into this so I can understand it?
@_date: 2016-05-31 04:34:29
Voohres doesn't deserve that. He's a noob.
@_date: 2016-07-03 10:04:30
Why was it created in 2008? Why not during the internet boom(1900-2000)
@_date: 2016-07-06 08:36:23
Wow nice find xD. Lmao.
@_date: 2016-07-24 00:27:42
That's a horrible rate.
@_date: 2016-07-03 13:14:00
Lol that's true aswell
