You have clearly not thought this through.
Word based filtering DOES NOT WORK.
Even Bayesian filtering (google it) DOES NOT WORK.
There are 1,300,925,111,156,286,160,896 ways to spell

Did you do ANY research before you made the decision to implement word based filter for idiots ?

Well, it is now the 2nd hour I try to join.
1). You are new to email, are you ?
Let me explain it to you.
It is not like paper were only the look is what counts and no one care about the ink you use.
When you send EVERY email (even the password recovery ones) as graphic only (not a single char in it) you can be 100% sure every spam filter (Google, Yandex, etc.) is putting your mail into the spam folder.
Because sending graphic only emails is something only spammer and clueless people do.
2). Nobody has ever explained to you how good password management works, right ?
Let me explain that to you too.
A good password management practise is when you choose a different username/email-proxy-address &amp; password for every online service you have to "sign up".
This way you never have to worry about any security breach of service A affecting service B too because you use the same name/email &amp; password combination for both (all ?) of them.
You need to use a secure password manager for this practise of course.
You have successful defeated the (even plugin-enhanced) browser password management system on   
Totally incompetence or just clueless ?
If I find a way storing my market.entropy password somehow in my password management system, I will give you feedback about the actually service.
Right now I fight with your bad choices.

If you had spend less time in making the website looking "hip" than you had probably some time left to make it work.
"Word Forbidden" ?
Are we at fucking ebay ?
Sorry, I can't use a website that is telling me that "Test Store" is a forbidden word.
Grow up, come back when done.
