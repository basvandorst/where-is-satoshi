Nah, it means you can use it for more time than it takes to recharge. It's actually more useful, even if it might not cost as much / be as "valuable"

And it doesn't cost $15 per transaction!

... it's because in order to get the bitcoins, you have to pay with some form of fiat currency.  The there's an exchange rate between USD, Zimbabwe's currency, and bitcoin, and right now the exchange rate is so steep between Zimbabwe "dollars" or wtf they are (I don't care enough about zimbabwe to look up its currency) and bitcoins that you could get more USD for first exchanging zimbabwe dollars to bitcoins, and then to USD, rather than just going to usd from zimbabwe dollars.
Alternatively, people who hold bitcoins trust USD A LOT more than zimbabwe dollars, so of course they'll charge more, even more than the typical exchange rates, because why else would they?  It's highly likely zimbabwe dollars are more volatile than BTC at this point.
tl;dr it's about exchange rates and risk.  Zimbabwe is fucking doomed (like venezuela but w/o oil)

... the people in zimbabwe don't have USD to buy the BTC with.  The reason it's not all interconnected is because of borders and regulations.  No one country can deflate / inflate BTC's value, but BTC's value can inflate / deflate relative to currencies that have extraordinary risk.

$10,000,000 - Break up the Big Coins!  Everyone should be able to have their own bitcoins.
