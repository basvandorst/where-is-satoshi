How could they monetize a fb coin?

You can still live exclusively off bitcoin by buying gift cards, and there are even rental sites for apartments. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:02:22
It is open-source and can be forked relatively easily, so which part are you talking about?

If you listen to the context, it seems like a bit of a diss though. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 07:25:26
But since BTC's inception, how much has its value risen against the US dollar?
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:32:15
The point is, bitcoin is not fiat according to the definition of fiat.
Fiat is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but is not backed by a physical commodity
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:55:29
So basically, they are developing a bitcoin software wallet. And of course they will have your private keys, to protect against terrorism and stuff.

@_date: 2014-06-18 20:02:26
Do you mind explaining how this could be possible?
@_date: 2014-06-17 04:21:00


Meaning they have to figure out how to incorporate fee and interest rapeage into the bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:18:45
Horrible news and worse article. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 18:57:47
That's still not fiat though right?
@_date: 2014-08-21 17:30:02
Well that's a start...
Still...any regulations enforced rely on the threat of violence if you don't comply, and limit the freedom of a large percentage of individuals. The option to voluntarily adhere to regulations is the only non-violent solution.
@_date: 2014-05-09 01:28:12
With tumblers and other possibilities, how can they know if you still hold Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-07-26 19:52:55
I don't mean that bitcoin literally relies on the USD for it to continue to function as a protocol. What I mean is that, for bitcoin to achieve mainstream success, or much success in general as a currency, it relies heavily on the USD and other fiat currencies.

@_date: 2014-07-26 20:44:26
It doesn't matter if 90 percent fits bitcoin like a glove. By definition, for it to be considered fiat, it has to be controlled by government. Sorry, but you are wrong.
@_date: 2014-07-21 20:41:58
It just seems like ignoring is a blatant concession. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 00:21:06
I've been looking all over the place for actual proof that they are trying to ban bitcoin. I can't find anything on any Ecuadorian government website. Any help?

Yea but not for long. Hopefully decentralized exchanges will take over.

I'm assuming the FEC will have to meet to determine more clearly whether bitcoin is an in-kind donation. If it is, say goodbye to the $100 maximum contribution level.

Yea probably. The Fed would make even more sense.

I think we need organization like this, as long as they remain transparent and representative of bitcoin and the community. They've been on top of shit so far and Perianne seems to know what she's doing. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 18:50:31
Point is, most people can't acquire bitcoin without fiat...right? So it kinda relies on it.
@_date: 2014-05-13 21:52:47
And to that I say, "Good."
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:31:55
Hmm...my point is...even with Ghash, you still have to place some amount of trust in them. Bitcoin is supposed to be only require you to trust the open source code.

You are telling people to use an alt-coin to pay for coffee, basically.
Bitcoin was designed to be used as peer-to-peer electronic cash. 
It was designed to spend ANY amount of money cheaply and quickly.

@_date: 2018-10-04 15:06:58
Yes. The real question we need answered now is "Have these devices been compromised?" and if so, what does it mean for our security? 
This should definitely be posted in and Would be nice to have some input from the companies, @_date: 2017-08-02 15:19:37
I have original BTC on a ledger wallet. Haven't touched them in months. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:29:51
Does Ledger itself inspect the motherboards on devices before they are sent to customers? If not every singly device, how regularly does Ledger perform complex audits of inventory, specifically looking for microchips the size of a grain of rice? The Bloomberg report says that China even began implanting these chips between layers of fiberglass onto which other components are attached? Are your devices inspected thoroughly enough to detect one of these?
If a device did contain one of these Chinese microchips, China would be able to intercept private keys and seed phrases. Would these be in raw form or would they be encrypted?
Has your company ever found such a device inside one of your products? Is Ledger aware of any plans or attempts to compromise the product? Would you tell us if you had, or would that information be too sensitive to share?
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:55:21
Is that a "no comment" to all of my questions?
If someone wanted to compromise a hardware wallet, it seems to me that it would be less complex to covertly infiltrate at the manufacturing level and install a chip there, rather than covertly intercepting and swapping an entire batch of legit ledger devices with identical looking compromised devices.
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:29:16

Right now, in Mycelium, to buy a $2 coffee and have it confirmed within 10 minutes at the highest priority level of 150 sat/byte, fees are $2.17, or more than the actual coffee. 
Edit: I love how this comment is downvoted when all I did was state the actual current fees that Mycelium has. Strange.
@_date: 2018-06-30 08:39:20
Please, tell me, how does it work then?

You don't have to migrate coins to implement quantum-resistant cryptography.
@_date: 2019-02-22 03:43:17
I think most people would approve it when they realize it's a matter of life or death for Bitcoin.
But like someone else said, if QC is achieved, we have far greater things to worry about: the entire internet and all its data is at stake. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:09:22

Bitcoin's main function is supposed to be as peer-to-peer cash, like the whitepaper says.
Of course Bitcoin can also serve as digital gold, but this is a secondary feature.
The fact that Max refuses to acknowledge this is extremely suspicious.

@_date: 2018-11-03 15:43:19

I especially like the idea of incorporating technology from  competing cryptos:


Is this actually feasible and/or desirable for Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-11-24 01:18:42
By that logic, living a normal life is gambling and we are all gamblers because every day we wake up and don't know what could happen during the day, but nonetheless, we continue to invest in life.

I don't think it will take years for the developers to reach an agreement on how to reasonably move forward with solving these problems in a way that keeps bitcoin in line with its founders' vision, unless the developers are compromised and intentionally killing bitcoin, which is also entirely possible.

A crypto is supposed to function how its white paper describes it as functioning. If you want to make the underlying use case of Bitcoin something different than described in the white paper, then you should fork it and do that. Stop trying to rewrite history.

You're not looking in the right places.
@_date: 2019-01-28 20:26:54
Sorry but no. It's a logical fallacy and rightfully discouraged from use during a debate because it attempts to discredit an argument not by refuting the claim itself, but by alleging hypocrisy and engaging in character assassination. 
If you are going to counter an argument, address the claims being made.
Edit: To make myself clear, I am not arguing that Ethereum is good or bad. This has nothing to do with Ethereum.

@_date: 2019-01-17 11:07:16
That's not how these projects work. The whitepaper describes what Bitcoin is supposed to be, and if you don't like that and want Bitcoin to be something else, then you need to fork it and create something else separately. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:33:21
Yep...I like how they explained that BTC could be used for micropayments, as easy as dropping coins in a vending machine.
I think that pretty much puts a nail in the coffin of anyone claiming that Satoshi intended BTC to be used primarily as a store of value.

Again, projects are supposed to adhere to their white paper. That's how this works. You're claiming the opposite, which is incorrect. Bitcoin is first and foremost peer-to-peer electronic cash, which can act as gold as a secondary use case. If you want Bitcoin's main function to be something other than this, then you need to fork it.

Non-aggression principle has its own Wikipedia page, on which it states: "The non-aggression principle (or NAP; also called the non-aggression axiom, the anti-coercion, zero aggression principle or non-initiation of force) is an ethical stance asserting that aggression is inherently wrong. In this context, "aggression" is defined as initiating or threatening any forcible interference with an individual or individual's property. In contrast to pacifism, it does not forbid forceful defense.
**The NAP is considered by some to be a defining principle of natural-rights libertarianism. It is also a prominent idea in anarcho-capitalism, (classical) liberalism, libertarianism, and minarchism."**"

Fact is, anarcho-capitalism is a subsect of anarchism. Your opinion on its legitimacy is just that, an opinion. Anarchism is not fundamentally against capitalism. Anarchism *is* fundamentally against coercion.

That's a a common misconception about anarchists. Most anarchists also believe in the rule of law. The key distinction is that most anarchists believe that all interactions between government and people must be based on voluntary mutual consent. Meaning, no law can force someone else to do something against their will. Of course anarchists also base their ideology on the non-aggression principle, which is an innate set of rules that must be respected.

Correction, Bitcoin is a monetary play, as in peer-to-peer electronic cash. Like it states in the title of the white paper. Bitcoin is currently unable to function as sound cash because transaction times take too long.
Why are some people trying so hard to redefine Bitcoin as digital gold when Satoshi clearly had a different vision in mind?

You make a good point, if it's true that the computer scientists and engineers who built bitcoin are saying what you claim they are saying. However, one must remember that they are computer scientists and engineers, not investing professionals who are skilled in predicting market behavior and reading/studying/translating the behavior of investors. I realize that crypto markets are relatively new, but the human psychological mechanisms that influence markets are not.

Same story for others on the committee. At least one other committee man said his children have brought up the topic of bitcoin at dinner before. Surely they own some by now.

This is probably what they are doing.. Remember when that senior executive at CME said they were going to "tame" Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-12-23 03:34:50
The problem is that Bitcoin developers refuse to scale Bitcoin and keep delaying lightning. Adam Back (not that he's a developer but still) said in an interview in 2015 that 6 mb blocks would be reasonable by 2018, but for some reason it hasn't happened.
Oh and don't expect a development roadmap because they apparently don't give a shit about users. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:42:11
What does this have to do with a roadmap?
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:42:02
Not really a good enough argument against a roadmap in my opinion. I think Satoshi would want the general public to know what the future holds for Bitcoin, being that he so highly valued openness. I mean, people would like to know when Bitcoin is going to scale, for one. I also think he would want for Bitcoin transactions to be confirmed in less than 10 minutes with fraction-of-a-cent fees.
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:14:03
The fundamentals haven't changed. Things are only improving, especially once lightning is fully implemented. I'd say Bitcoin is undervalued.
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:49:18


A lot of cryptos have way more features than bitcoin.
It doesn't really make sense to not have a roadmap because you have a lot of features. If anything, there would be even more of a need for a roadmap. And Bitcoin definitely has not attained critical mass yet.
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:19:53
Looks like a similar thing happened around December 2014 or January 2015, before the market turned bullish.
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:46:57
Developers work together on large projects like lightning and dandelion. There should be a published roadmap of timelines for projects of this nature.
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:07:30
Bitcoin is still in its infancy - still in beta. Once lightning is fully operational, it should perform better as a currency. You two just happened to buy at the wrong time. If you had bought a year earlier, you'd still have some extremely nice profits.
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:00:39

There seems to be a huge disconnect with developers.
