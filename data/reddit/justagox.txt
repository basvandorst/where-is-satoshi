it is all odd. there may be some need for translation in the future, but not this minute. They should be hopefully releasing some actual statement shortly, either in Russian or translating themselves. The 50% fee is insane given that $320/hour is more than fair in Russia, where I would only guess that mob lawyers make that much. the $320/fee is still crazy to ask when they still haven't shared any actual information. Will let you know if we need any translating in future, at moment I guess finding a Russian native who can share his thoughts seems to be quite hard

Personally, I agree with all your points. Sadly, and perhaps understandably, a lot of people are ready to jump in with them and have started handing over documents and singing contract. yes, what they are doing is not  "normal" and quite alarming. It seems that their statements have been shifting a bit and it's hard to attribute it to either them making things up, language barrier, or their liaison misunderstanding things. They are deliberately hiding info, demanding a crazy 50% contingency fee (if they collect on their stated amount it will be the largest contingency fees amount paid ever in the world), and some made up deadline. Thank you for taking a look and giving your opinion.
edit: no evidence or anything useful has been actually shared with the creditors as far as I am aware, because this is their "trade secret".
Some things they mentioned: hard to go after bitcoin since they aren't viewed as assets. criminal cases are confidential, especially this one!
