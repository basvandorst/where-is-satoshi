This is why they want BTC to be illegal.  because you could flee the country with 10,000,000 in dirty/washed/tumbling BTC and they can't "capture the money" the cartels are sending across borders.

You should consider accepting dogecoin.

Compelling read, but that's exactly why I am saving those 25btc.  because when it hops to 25000 a share, i'm going to be a very happy man.  I am concerned about the short term at the moment because i'm trying to buy something for 100usd with btc, and I have that wallet with what was 105usd not two days ago, and now it's at 94.94.  i obviously don't want to add money to it because then i'll have to deal with purchasing more from someone else, and I have my btc savings which i won't touch.
I just don't feel like dealing with the hassle of adding more, because i don't exactly go from bank account to wallet.  so i'm hoping over the next two weeks it doesn't take a short term dip which would make me end up spending way more on what was originally cheaper, if i worded that correctly
May I ask, personally what's your bitcoin stake? how long have you been in, and what's your target?

You didn't come off as an ass at all, I have about 25btc that i've been sitting on since 2009, I never really planned on cashing it out I just like to know I have it. I was just wondering if this media attention is positive for BTC or not, with all of the media attention it's definitely going to make people call up their brokers and ask about BTC.
I was at a bar last night, and the talk of the evening was that news story and I feel that with all of this attention on btc it may scare the banking world into pushing for regulation on it, or maybe have them embrace it.  
and in the meantime, do you think that the average yokel is going to be calling up their brokers, and asking about investing in internet money or do you think the idea of investing in inherently nothing is still too scary for the general populous?

Thank you for fueling the conversation I was trying to start, you're a real stand up guy. 
You make a very valid point about the obscurity of bitcoin, I like where it is, because I like to use it as currency.  
I just hope my .4796 that I need to spend doesn't drop below the asking price, because then I have more of a hassle to deal with.  I would really  rather it stayed at about 205 for the next 3 weeks.  but when I logged on today I saw it that lost a little value since yesterday, and that's what prompted me to ask this question.
