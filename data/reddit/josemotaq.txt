What's you opinion on the best scaling solution so far?

Supposedly he purchased over the past 12 months, and supposedly the recent spike in BTC is due to the news about mastercard. Supposedly.

Yes, it's decentralized. And yes, you can have developers customize some code and incentivize miners (with money) to support your hard fork. That's what bcash (BCH) is, and that's also why Bitcoin (BTC) is still the leading cryptocurrency with over 48% dominance. Anyone can create a bogus fork (that's why there's so many), but because it's decentralized, miners can collectively support the coin they believe in, which is BTC.

So crypto gets rid of 3 intermediaries I wonder if it will ever be possible to make online transactions that equate to in-person cash transactions with only 2 parties. Maybe, maybe not.

No, it's not $1,000 in gains nor break even. You only have to report capital gains on any sells from crypto to fiat.

In summary the gist of CA AB 2658 proposes to simply define blockchain technology in statute (not including smart contracts) to provide users and businesses greater certainty. It suggests **blockchain technology to be defined as an electronic record** under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). I assume this will be used when there is a legal issue between parties, taxes, labeling, identifying e.g., so then CA businesses and individuals can point to this bill in case of disputes.

What's BIP-38? I thought the same about only having to save the private key OR seed phrase to be safe.

Yes via mining or arbitrage. And Yes.

Banks are businesses, let's not forget.

Nope, not with Poloniex or Bittrex. For fiat to crypto, all I know is there’s Coinbase in the  United States. I’m not sure  if Coinbase is available in Canada tho, maybe it is!

Were you paying much higher with localbitcoins? Those exchanges are crypto-only meaning that you will have to buy crypto from somewhere else, then use that crypto to buy other currencies. Currently, you cannot buy crypto with fiat on those exchanges.

From my experience, every single blockchain I know of has a cryptocurrency. In the case of Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA (tangle), EOS and so on. Due to it's decentralized nature, there is some sort of account with value. If it's voting, there is a value to each vote. It turns monetary as long as someone is willing to buy and someone is willing to sell (theoretical example: someone can PayPal me $20 to use my blockchain based vote on candidate A).
How can cryptocurrencies (units of account in this case) be separated from it's underlying infrastructure (blockchain) or vice versa? I'm not saying I'm/you're wrong or right, just curious.

Yes, it would speed up the halving. It can be an issue, why would you want to reduce the block reward so quickly?

It means users trust Bitcoin more than any other coin. We don't really see an active "leader of bitcoin," which I think people see as a reassuring thing. Sure there's Satoshi Nakamoto, but we see active leaders in every other cryptocurrency out there. And the actions of those leaders (creators, founders, co-founders) have a huge impact on our trust of their product.

I think its good for blockchain in general. Providing a framework allows corporations to use blockchain and cryptocurrencies with certainty. So yes, long-term I believe legislation helps increase adoption for cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin.

Unplug for a few seconds then when plugging back in, hold both buttons. If you don't do anything it will just stay loading forever.
