these are public boards, noob wasn't directed at you. 
your response is naive. think about it, what kind of people go on coinbase to buy bitcoin? do they understand the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash? this props up the value. further, if the major holders (mostly ver) dumped all their btrash, they wouldn't get shit out of it. why is ver paying people to shill for him? why is he buying up expensive real estate to publish fud? he'll get the biggest payout the more people he scams. 
if you go back to my previous repsonse you will see the post is for the noobs that are being scammed. i can only assume you are a shill or feel sorry for you being lost in the fud. i hope you can find your way out of either situation. best of luck to you.

where are you planning to buy this coffee from? why use a scam coin like bch when there WAY cheaper coins (transaction wise) and far less scammier coins than bcash? why are you supporting roger ( who are you trying to fool? btw, even BSV is less expensive than bcash.
@_date: 2019-03-04 20:54:54
bch is not bitcoin. it's a scam coin.
he sent you bitcoin to the bch address you gave him, this is not a bitcoin address.  you are using one of the worst wallets that supports the scam coin bitcoin cash (bch).
this shouldn't be the end of the world, try loading your private key into a legitimate bitcoin wallet, NOT BITCOIN CASH.
once you have access to your bitcoin, leave a horrid review for the bitcoin.com scam wallet app and delete it.  do not delete it until you have access to your bitcoin.
i wish i could help you more, but i have no experience with that shit software or shitcoin.  try to relax and research your wallet options before you fall for another scam and lose your bitcoin.

this is false to anyone that has paid attention to what has happened over at coinbase vs other exchanges.  a quick example was when coinbase released bitcoin cash trading on their exchange, except wait, they didn't allow selling of bitcoin cash ONLY BUYING (not to mention all of the other shady instances that occurred around their release of btrash). it's all very clear to anyone paying attention.
List of bitcoin friendly exchanges: Bisq  Localbitcoins  HodlHodl  Gemini  Kraken  BL3P  Cash App  Flyp  (no fiat)
I believe these exchanges have a better record when it comes to supporting bitcoin. Many of them aren't perfect, but definitely a step in the right direction.
As always, do your own research. Start with small amounts and never leave coins on an exchange. not your keys, not your bitcoin.
Bitstamp has had a great reputation, but it was recently bought out and users are complaining about enhanced KYC, so I'm not too sure about it now.
Need some more input on these exchanges: bitfinex (probably ok), hitbtc, coinsbank, walltime (probably ok), binance (*STILL no segwit), and liberalcoins?

My understanding is that it's the same sort of experience as CB.  more like a traditional exchange, so a tiny bit less user friendly than CB.  Gemini has been way less toxic to bitcoin than CB, but other exchanges have been significantly better.  Gemini still hasn't implemented segwit and Gemini owners have also been campaigning for more and more regulation.
