Best is subjective. You can get viruses on any OS, it just depends on how many dumb clicks/downloads you make. If you arent comfortable with doing the bios flashing and driver updating to make linux work well on a chromebook then stick with chromeOS.

0.05 btc?? It would take my gaming computer nearly a year to mine that much btc at 24/7 full throttle, i can guarantee you that that sort of hashing power isnt possible in a phone. If youve actually mined btc and transferred it to different wallets and can use it in exchanges/point to it in the blockchain then thats impressive, but this sounds like a scam and even describes itself as a simulator, not real mining software

Your best bet is making this list yourself. Bonus points if you make a python script to automatically update the list yearly/monthly. For cryptos, i like looking at coingecko but there are other price tracking websites

The swell conference is coming up in two weeks, im having a hard time stopping myself from trading my btc for more xrp to catch the wave

that app describes itself as a bitcoin mining *simulator*, not a real mining app. Even then, you would never see a return on using your phone to mine when youre not using it. This is 100% either harvesting your data, or actually mining on your phone but keeping the hashes to itself.  
Question, have you been able to transfer whatever youve mined to a different wallet with this app?

Natural water would be a terrible idea because of algae/calcium buildup, not to mention Im not sure if any asics are even designed to be water-proofed for cooling. With regards to air cooling, again you dont want electronics directly exposed to the outside. That low temp air is good so you dont need to actively AC the mining room, but you'd still need active airflow so a heat pocket doesnt form around the mining rigs

Youre now tanking bitcoin lower because you expect it to go up

If this hardware is at the school/on the school network, please dont mine on it. I dont want you to get in trouble with sysadmins/professors for using their hardware for personal profit. If you can take the laptop/computer home then maybe its okay to mine on it, just make sure that software isnt still present on the computer when you return it.

Do you trust google? If you only use the laptop for the browser then i guess chromeOS is fine, but chromebooks have the hardware to be decent laptops and can do alot more if you put a full OS on it. Plus there are OSes like pop_os that are designed for security/encryption instead of trusting google w all your data

Id suggest booting a full linux distro onto your chromebook instead of using chromeOS

So... you buy hashing power with your ingame currency? Dude this is just a passive cookie clicker style game thats skinned as bitcoin mining. Stop wasting your time and either buy real btc with real money as an investment, or look into mining altcoins like monero

Are you asking how to do math? You look at the amount of btc in usd you bought initially (after exchange/transfer fees), scale by the percentage growth of the price you sold at to the price you bought at, and subtract your initial investment from your return to see how much was earned.  
If you needed this explained to you do you think youre ready to be investing in bitcoin?

Low daily market volume, btc is unable to regain/hold higher support levels. All of this sideways trading along with sudden drops ruins market confidence

Bitcoin will almost certainly go lower in the near future.  
Alternatively, dunk that money into ripple and smoke some hopium

If people are dumb enough to buy into that, thats on them.

Good luck noticing short term patterns in Bitcoin. I got into the btc game a little over a month ago and the only thing Ive concluded is worth my time/consistent will be hodling long for at least six months

To give you context, antminer S9s cost anywhere from $300 to $1300 just to purchase. Even with free electricity, an S9 will only mine approximately $60 worth of btc a month. There are no physical asic miners associated to your account in this game, its just *simulating* creating a mining farm. If you enjoy this as a game then stick with it, but if you want to make money this is a waste of time. Besides, there are more profitable things to be doing at 17 than trying to scrape cryptocurrency together

Use a software wallet on a phone/laptop with a good account password and maybe two-factor authentication. Make a custom recovery key for the wallet that can be remembered without the need to write it down

You asked this same question three months ago, and got similar answers about how to do the math. What part of the earning calculation is still confusing for you?
