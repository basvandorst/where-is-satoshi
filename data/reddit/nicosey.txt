thanks.  I looked at that, but it does not support testnet.
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:07:20
Yes, am interested.
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:47:42
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:22:14
Yep, I would be using if it was the case, as I have a 21 computer.
@_date: 2016-04-23 19:14:50
Do you have a contact on how to invest?
@_date: 2016-08-15 16:37:44
Yep.  I could not find it.
I tend went on their slack channel and they said its not yet not supported.
@_date: 2016-04-17 17:06:46
Will it be open source?
@_date: 2016-04-21 13:36:09
Could this not be moved offshore?
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:19:40
@_date: 2016-04-21 19:28:17
Maybe they expect a big rush after halving.  Scarcity could be helpful here...
@_date: 2016-04-07 17:53:42
Have to also agree.  Great company
@_date: 2016-04-15 00:35:47
Isn't liquid already out?  Is that not a sidechain?
@_date: 2016-04-10 12:08:31
Any update on when the COIN ETF will be available?
@_date: 2016-04-03 18:56:46
coincut.com is pretty cool.  Minimal Id.
@_date: 2016-04-20 19:10:22
What happened to this product?
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:48:04
I use that. 
However you can't connect to the bitcoin test network with it.
@_date: 2016-04-14 14:58:11
Vultr is brilliant being using for the last few months.  Not one problem and was up and running in minutes.
@_date: 2016-03-26 00:23:18
who runs the nodes and what's
 the incentive?
@_date: 2016-03-22 13:35:03
Why do people run these full nodes now?
@_date: 2016-03-08 15:53:54
@_date: 2016-03-11 16:39:11
coincap.io Be aware its very addictive :)
@_date: 2016-03-25 13:05:01
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:32:18
Great!  So you will you will get the Core dev team for a 10th of the price of the BU dev team.  I know where I will invest me cash :)
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:43:22
Surely that is the issue.  Own research?  This is a problem in distributed computing, yet it has become a flame war and not an engineering investigation.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:50:20
Vorhees is a fake.  There are both not developers and should never have gotten involved in blocksize debate.  They should have stuck to marketing.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:22:24
And now pumping alts.  Bitcoin needs to go back to engineering
@_date: 2016-03-22 23:49:49
So that is fiat?
@_date: 2017-03-27 21:22:28
Hence UASF
@_date: 2017-03-19 11:30:44
I got into bitcoin as an engineering / distributed computing interest.  When I hear Ver go on about big blocks.  I am like, are you qualified?
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:41:26
Yep, we want to fire the core team with rookies.  Great business decision.
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:00:50
how would they deal with segwit transactions?
@_date: 2017-03-25 01:43:57
Shit got real
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:02:15
Are you an engineer of from a technical background?
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:13:46
Well how many alts are under attack by a hard fork?
@_date: 2016-03-26 10:57:58
In UK i have found that coincut.com is.
@_date: 2016-03-08 15:26:25
What's the advantage of circle over coinbase?
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:35:19
Bitcoin Resurrected
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:10:41
This guy should take more responsibility consider he was part of the problem with Satoshi Dice.
@_date: 2016-03-30 13:51:26
Is it possible to start a Lightning Network node then?
@_date: 2016-06-20 18:26:29
I read the 2 hour article.  It does say CW is nolonger involved with the company that was pushing patents.
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:11:17
This brilliant, be like the seti at home days!
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:10:25
I don't think these guys would want to work under the tyranny of Ver or Wu.  They have already made it clear their opinions of emergent consensus, its technically flawed.  Not sure why BU have not run it under a test net for a while like SegWit.
@_date: 2017-01-29 10:55:12
So the "liquid" Sidechain is centralised?
@_date: 2016-06-15 16:22:11
Read about the Bank of England Nominees Limited.  Its situation is not very clear.
@_date: 2016-06-09 18:40:42
Isn't the liquidity less on Gemini.
I have been thinking of switching to them
@_date: 2016-06-29 14:34:00
Totally agree.
I am all up for debate.  However it should be more about science and real data.  This guy is focusing on the wrong area.  
If science shows its logical to increase, with facts that this will not damage the network, then great.
However let this be an engineering solution.  When outsiders who don't understand technology meddle it never ends well.  I am an engineer with over 20 years of programming experience.  I have spent much time looking over the bitcoin code, and can honestly say I am not qualified to make statements about it.  So not sure why this guy from his business background can.  
He should hire some strong engineers to provide some factual data on the subject.
@_date: 2017-01-08 03:12:56
I hear sometimes that TumbleBit solves scalability as well as privacy.  Can anyone explain how this is so?
@_date: 2016-06-01 01:12:27


thanks for your insight.
@_date: 2016-06-29 02:26:18
"I would never dream of telling the current Bitcoin Core team the correct way to build a cryptographic consensus network"
Is that what he is doing?
I wish these business type would let this be an engineering discussion...
@_date: 2016-06-20 18:29:56
Brilliant article.  However it does say CW is nolonger involved with company pushing the patents.
@_date: 2016-12-01 17:50:03
It wasn't another 45 days?
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:05:20
I tend to enjoy this guy's view point.  However being a clairvoyant is not what is necessary.  Bitcoin's future price will be dictated by events.  For example the release on an ETF will shoot up the price 10x.  However if the ETF gets hacked expect the price to go down considerably.
@_date: 2016-12-01 10:25:40
When is the new hearing date?
@_date: 2016-12-11 00:09:44
Who cares?
@_date: 2017-04-01 10:28:53
Perhaps this would make more sense with a flex cap approach?  Essentially you would replace the BU proposition?
@_date: 2017-04-16 11:57:34
Time we advocate people like Ver do courses like this?  
@_date: 2017-04-15 17:34:54
how many lines of code has this guy written?
@_date: 2016-09-26 11:11:11
So would this like be using an oracle script, except that in this case the oracle pub key is the data set that I want signed?
@_date: 2016-09-30 23:10:20
What would happen if a big rush to bitcoin happened?  Seriously I overheard people in my office discussing it.  What happens in millions to the currency, does the the network crash?
@_date: 2016-09-26 05:46:19
Sorry I am not sure what you mean by that.  You mean using OP_RETURN as part of the multisig?
@_date: 2016-09-26 06:24:13
Thanks!  That is very interesting.  Do you have or know of any examples?
@_date: 2016-09-27 00:29:31
I thought nonce was part to the block?
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:34:43
Always a bad sign when management ignore their engineers.
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:50:55
Great, keep up the good work
@_date: 2016-10-01 08:57:06
Lets hope layer 2 solutions come soon...
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:21:54
Vinny is not making sense...
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:02:56
Maybe Andreas is worried this guy becomes face of bitcoin and that will be bad for him.
@_date: 2016-05-04 14:03:46
True, but does help bridge the gap for our fiat friends out there...
@_date: 2016-05-04 09:45:35
Well, I am not expert.  However I have used 21s API.  It does have  simple to use payment channel functionality.  It literally is 2 lines of python code to create and use a payment channel.  
Much of their value prop comes from the market place.  Again 1 line of code and you can register a service to be sold.
@_date: 2016-05-04 08:57:21
There providing an API, not a centralised service.
There benefit is sell their market place.
@_date: 2016-05-04 11:31:41
I do believe so, their API definitely supports multisig.  They have basically built a very clean API on top of existing BTC opt codes.  
If you download the API, and go through the tutorial you will will have a payment channel up and running in less than 15minutes.
@_date: 2016-05-31 12:51:20
Congrats bro.  Would you still buy now?
@_date: 2016-05-22 11:01:56
Could Russia be secretly building Bitcoin reserves?  Could make be being done easily.  They have cheap electricity and could also get into mining without to much stress.
@_date: 2016-05-03 13:34:34
Very good point.  
This guy has an odd way of doing things, however it was odd in the first place that Satoshi just went missing.
@_date: 2016-05-05 20:12:25
Sounds probably.  People says this guy is a con man, but to conn what?  I think we are the ones being played.  He probably wants to like the noise down a bit before he reveals again.  The nonsense has been a bit too much...
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:58:47
I think he just has a mad dog character.  Do you ever think Satoshi would be normal?
@_date: 2016-05-04 09:46:19
I can't see that happening.  They are very much focuses on infrastructure and already link to coinbase.
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:24:34
Craig Wright for President
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:41:14
Realistically he was never going to live up to the hype.
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:40:30
The guy seems cool to me :)
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:37:08
Who needs TV after this
@_date: 2016-05-04 00:43:48
Think of this as true micropayments for all.  No need to wait for lightning now...
@_date: 2016-05-03 13:35:19
Yep, even my dad mentioned it because of this.  BBC exposure to bitcoin is great.
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:36:55
This is better than a movie
@_date: 2016-05-04 08:59:19
Well you basically batch you micropayments into 1 large TX.
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:33:58
Does not make sense.  This guy obviously has a huge ego.  Unfortunately this is not the end of him.  He will be back.
@_date: 2016-05-07 21:29:37
Interesting.  I think the price will stay the same.  It will failures in the current financial system which will create huge spikes.  
Like a country defaulting and switching to BTC, sudden loss in confidence in fiat (dollar, sterling, euro) or a strong movement to 
metals. 
I expect it to be well over a $1000 by end of year :)
@_date: 2016-05-22 15:15:57
Anything to allow us more time to stock before the fiat system crashes :)
@_date: 2016-05-22 23:16:22
I hear you brother.  Twice I have had to order new credit cards this year, because they have been compromise.  So much easier just to snap with a QR code...
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:38:01
What is the worst he can do?  He could dump his coins, that would just mean cheap coins for us all :)
@_date: 2016-05-04 13:05:17
it has a command line wallet and wallet API.  
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:35:12
This guy is brilliant.  Who would have thought Satoshi would have been such an entertainer.
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:14:06
This guy is insane, so there you go...
@_date: 2016-05-04 09:48:01
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:22:17
Surely this is an opportunity for us (bitcoin community) to build properly functional ICOs, rather than this ether stuff.
@_date: 2017-06-03 09:33:20
Not an ICO? :)
