Thanks for the positive attitude. We are doing some final tests and fees and we launch on the testnet on Nov 20th. Come then and try a swap. Feedback is highly appreciated so that we can improve it and finally make nearly feeless exchanges, as you said.

 Hi guys,  
We are working on a new product  [ . It is a real implementation of cross-chain atomic swaps. Meaning that you can exchange coins between different blockchains peer-to-peer. On Nov 20th we launch on the testnet. Feel free to test it - feedback highly appreciated.
@_date: 2019-11-14 19:16:58
Hmm,  
Can you try it again.  
We are heavily developing it and there is some down time.   
It will be stable until 20th Nov.  
It looks like a simple form, but there are plenty of modules and services and we are just refining it.  
Thank you for the feedback.  
If you can try it again and for example exchange test eth for test trx, I think that you will enjoy the speed and simplicity.  
You can try the BTC pair as well, but it will take like 10 min for the transaction to be confirmed.  
There is some test account, which everyone can use for the tests ;)

Low That's cool, we will take a look definitely!  
Here is the tron HTLC

Here is the  ETH HTLC:

We have tried to KISS.  
There are 3 main functions  
Lock, Withdraw, Refund  
A few validations and get status.  
We hope that it is readable and elegant.  
All of the important logic is happening on-chain.  
And we have p2wsh Bitcoin Script with similar logic.  
Maybe we can collaborate and we will be happy to invite everyone to our discord channel - you can find it in the website ;)

Bitcoin option will be available on Nov 20th when we officially launch on the testnet.

Hah we want to keep it geeky and funny as well ;)
@_date: 2019-11-14 19:12:50
Yes we can easily add USDC and DAI. We prefer DAI - more decentralized ;)

I hope it was helpful. There are many descriptions out there but all of them confusing.

Her BTC are time locked. That is why we say Time Locked Transactions. Once, she deposits them to the blockchain, they are locked for certain amount of time (few hours) ad she cannot do anything with them. This time is enough as a guarantee for Bob to go and take them. So Alice cannot "immediately" go back and unlock her BTC. It is all powered by algorithm so to protect against such fraud.
@_date: 2019-11-14 13:35:50
Go see it now - we changed a bit. Is it better now?
@_date: 2019-11-13 15:14:50
hah yeah we wanted to be a bit informal. You like the design?
@_date: 2019-11-14 19:26:46
Yes, Alice locks her funds for e.g. 6 hours, but she know the secret key (she has an advantage).  
Bob locks his funds for e.g 3 hours - he does not know the secret key, but he has time advantage.  
When Alice unlocks her funds, even if she does it in the last minute, Bob will have 3 extra hours to refund, because the secret key is already released.

There is an exchange where you can list whatever token you have and want to sell.  [

 It is the same everytime we go down. People start looking back at crypto bull markets from the past, they assume it was an easy ride to the top and hodlers got lucky. But days like this prove otherwise. Only the strongest will survive and profit. This is how to be one of the “lucky” ones.
Too much heart and too little brain. Most people buy at the pick and sell at the low because they get excited when everyone is excited and they get desperate when everyone is desperate.
