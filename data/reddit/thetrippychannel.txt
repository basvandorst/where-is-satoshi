What if he actually does know who created bitcoin, and as a result of this he reveals it

This brings up a question that I haven't really ever seen discussed. Doesn't it seem counter-intuitive for the creator of bitcoin to dictate how many bitcoins will ever be produced and put into circulation and then go and isolate a million bitcoin? Did he change his mind about the supply? Is he doing this intentionally to boost the value of bitcoin? Does he have some kind of master plan to take of the world once btc reaches 100k?

I'm going on 48 hours with no confirmation also. This is such bullshit, never in my 5 years of using bitcoin has a transaction taken half this long to confirm.

Bitcoin is about to launch into another dimension. The next great depression is upon us. The US dollar will fail, it is certain and inevitable. Every dollar that is printed is in turn, turned into debt 1.8x time over (fractional reserve banking). The US stock market is collapsing and so will fiat currencies. The time for bitcoin's rise is surely approaching. John McAfee was right, bitcoin will be worth millions of dollars in 2020.
