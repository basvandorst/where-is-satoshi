Big government overlord puff piece.

I never agreed to a contract. It's involuntary.

You assume citizenship requires all these things, but it should not. The government takes my money, then nearly forces the usage of their K-12 education, they do force their shitty handling of utilities, healthcare, and roads, and so forth.  
  
It's not a fucking contract, it's conscription. A contract requires 1. an offer, 2. **ACCEPTANCE** and 3. consideration. Get the fuck out of here with your shit ideas of contracts.

Name calling / ad hominem so quickly?  It's a shame the word "contract" was co-opted to mean something else entirely. Sugar coating theft and conscription with the word "contract" does not change the nature of the government's behavior: they remove my property and labor without my consent. Theft is still theft. 
  
I am not against social services. There are things that I would not hesitate to voluntarily pay for, but you still assume that these apparatus should be government controlled.

It's involuntary.

Only if it was a private road built by a private company and they did not give me permission to use their property. You're still bringing in metaphors that are not actually dealing with theft.

Yes they are.


You are right. They need all of our money to pay for the innumerable (and nearly all unnecessary) systems, "services" and God knows what else that has us trillions in debt.


Don't give a shit. Argument from age fallacy.


  


Definitely wrong. Making a stink about issues is what puts them on the cultural map and the more people who hear it, the better.

Red Herring. Refuse to pay and refuse to cooperate long enough and law enforcement will be there, armed.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:55:51
No, you are dead wrong. It is involuntary. Being law does not make it voluntary, it just makes it legal. To top it off, the US is one of the few countries that will tax me no matter what country I live in, or planet for that matter.
You metaphor is irrelevant because my property or labor is not being stolen from me when I drive on the road.

I'll also add, to clarify, that I believe taxation, at the most minimal level is likely necessary, especially when we come to the topic of crime and punishment, but it still does not change the nature of taxation.

Can't talk bad about Paypal? PayPal is a pos. Why don't they stop being bad and stop freezing assets. I make sure that the bank account I have connected to PayPal always has a zero balance.

I meant "point of sale" ;)

"but she ain't messin' with \*no\* broke, broke..."  
but you were right there. :)

It was a typo for "hold" that became a meme. Don't know where you got that made up acronym.
@_date: 2016-07-31 17:10:40
Yes. This nuance is great.
@_date: 2016-07-30 20:06:58
It should mean this, but it doesn't always mean this. The voodoo on Wall Street of making money out of money for the sake of money loses this meaning.

I think the author is actually trying to argue against hyper-capitalism--the kind that wants to make money for money itself--this system, he argues, is on the out. The current system rewards abundance more than good solid work and craftsmanship. The current system lacks meaning. He lauds trade for craftsmanship, which is still capitalistic in a sense. Currency and trade aren't going anywhere. It's the values behind these things that are shifting.
