Ok, I guess the correct way of saying it is more transactions can be fit into a block. How does this lower the fees going forward?

Why's that? Is it because of the bigger block size? If so, how come?

Do you think if I contact Coinbase and my bank, I'd get the purchase to un-reverse itself? In that case, I don't actually want the coins to sit in the online wallet I made in coinbase. Is there a way to transfer the coins? I assume I'd provide my wallet address and that'd be it.

Thanks for the sub link, but I've pretty much got electrum set up at this point. All I want now is to get some coins before it explodes again lol. If only I had started last month, I'd have $50 profit right now, haha.

I've calculated it would cost me about $2.50 to run the thing for a whole day, and most sites estimate with 4.73 TH/s, I would get about 0.001 BTC per day. So, what, about $1-$2 dollars per day, or more, depending on price increases? That sounds pretty decent. I would start losing money if the price dropped below $2.5k.

how so? electricity is pretty cheap in my area. If I mine for a while I'll make my money back it seems. Passive income (even if small and insignificant) sounds cool and will increase with time if I sit on my coins, right?

How much noise does an S7 produce? I have a cold back room in my basement that would probably do nicely for storage. My power is about 7-8 cents per kWh, I think. Is that cheap? Also, does cloud mining just mean setting up an account and giving them your address? How does it work?
