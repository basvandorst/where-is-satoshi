welcome to decentralized currency?
@_date: 2017-01-02 13:15:27
Sell now and wait 1-2 months top, then buy.
It'll go at least below 600 USD.
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:15:21
Yeah, try to ensure that you get to sell at the top

I agree. This is the best criticism I've read on Bitcoin.
About having a big part of the "supposed money" to dump when "no fools are left":how much was mined before April, how much was mined 2 months ago?
I mean, could the creators have mined so much that they truly can mess up the market?
This is important to know.
I must say I dont agree with everything and still believe that Bitcoin can be a gamechanger for currency.

They can't close access to the exhange?

What is the value of a currency if it is not used to buying anything?
All people do is buy buy buy bitcoins, but do they actually spend them?
@_date: 2013-12-14 11:56:25
What difference does it make that it happened over a period of years - how long did it take to produce the first million bitcoins opposed to now?
It is extremely unlikely that the creators of Bitcoin did not mine a huge amount of bitcoin when it was first released, regardless of them being do-gooders og evil-doers. This is on a level where they could now own a relativly big percentage of bitcoins. Can you imagine them not being at least millionaires right now?
Yes the Quark "scheme" might deliberatly have replicated and amplfied the negative sides of Bitcoin, but IMHO Bitcoin is not much better in that regard.
That being said, how would you ever create a decentralized cryptocurrency without the early adopters getting filthy rich, if the currency succeeds? 
I've yet to decide if bitcoin is made from good intent or evil.

It's impossible to have a real argument in /Bitcoin
This is a valid point, but you where downvoted because you've been critical towards this. Come on people!!!

"But let's downvote the hell out of con-BTC comments"
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:08:06
Maybe it's because people are selling btc on btcchina exchange due to the new restrictions and the possibility of freezing the assets - and of course the panic-people. 
Maybe those guys will want to buy btc again on another exchange

The amount of circlejerk on this subreddit is too damn high!
We both got downvoted
