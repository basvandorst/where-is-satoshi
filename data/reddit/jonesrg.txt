I don't think it covers it in the article, but the point here is that she wore diapers to make the 900 mile trip without stopping.
However, it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense because you obviously would have to stop for gas in that time frame...

I'm going to disagree slightly, but only with my unproven theory to back it up :) 
Let's say Bitcoin hits another bubble and makes it into the 4-figure range, then holds steady (how about $2000-3000 and whenever it gets there). Crypto will probably suddenly see a new wave of investors when the Bitcoin price jumps another few hundred percent and more legitimacy is established in the eyes of the private sector.
What's going to happen? Like me, lots of people are going to say "Well damn, I missed that boat" and probably look at other promising cryptos. Then - it all comes down to preference, I suppose. Let's face it, a lot of people see crypto investment (and holding) as a good way to get rich easily. Set it and forget it, right? Only a fraction see the bigger picture and a better world, but admittedly speculators affect the value as well but a lot more - both good, and bad.
But - if another currency succeeds to the point of Bitcoin with a second wave of "Crypto Mania" investors, there is going to be a lot of value sitting around in people's wallets. I mean, who knows - I could be a *very* comfortable person financially if Dogecoin *ever* makes it to the current Bitcoin market cap. If it does, I'm sure going to want to spend it on stuff. Crypto is easy to accept, so there's no reason vendors and services would not choose to accept multiple mainstream currencies as we see today (BTC, LTC, DOGE).
Long term - perhaps it will only come down to one currency, but that would be decades from now, I feel. Will it be Bitcoin? Who knows. Development and the infrastructure has a head start, that's for sure.
The best part of this whole game is the uncertainty. No one *really* knows. Anyone who claims to know everything clearly isn't very wise.
Whatever it is, to the moon! :D

So for only 1 BTC (aka $570 this very second) I can have my very own desktop 3d printer? Complete/operational, just have to put it all together?
I'd like to see some more information about the RepRap printer if you have it all specced out yet.

Wow, pretty neat. Thanks for the response.  I know this is but I don't any handy.

Lol at 1:25 with the look back at the host thinking, "I wonder if she realizes she turned the phone the wrong way.."
It's pretty true though. The first crypto ATMs in certain states/countries will end up as historic monuments in the future.

Could bitcoin really grow to $10k?
