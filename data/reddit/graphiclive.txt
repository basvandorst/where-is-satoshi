Should  I sell all Bitcoin and buy unlimited?

What exactly is this fork? What does it mean?
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:33:07
So wait, what is the other fork? Bitcoin and ?

And based off of your knowledge, today within the next couple hrs would be a good time to buy?
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:13:07
Cool, thanks!

Why do I need a wallet? Can I not just keep my coins stacked up safely in Coinbase? Do i need a wallet to exchange the currency to US dollars?

So I heard to buy through Gdax/coinbase ? I'm buying 30$ a week. How should I start? What is safe and easy? I am downloading the coinbase app.

Okay, so why don't more people take the short term route? Buy at 6300, sell at 6350, could this not be an easy way to make quick money? It seems the price fluctuates enough to buy low and sell higher multiple times throughout a day? What is stopping everyone?

Are Gdax and Coinbase the same thing?

Thank you! I just bought $50 at $6395.46 which is about 50$ higher then what it shows on charts atm. Is it usually that much higher when purchased?

Thanks a lot man, helped a lot today. How much is a wallet that you use?
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:30:27
How do I get started? Anything I should know? Best app or website to buy? As I plan on holding for a couple years and then selling. Is Bitcoin something you can buy for two days, sell the third day, amd buy back the 5th day... Fast trading?

Awesome thanks sir!

What is the need for a wallet? Is it not safe in coinbase?

Okay, so when I first buy, is there a way to get away from these big fees?
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:06:50
I will most likely reach back out to you! Last question, because of these fees, would it make more sense to buy 120$ at the end of a month or 30$ every week. Do the fees base off of quantity or quality sort of deal.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:12:06
Okay, either way, I want to start investing. How do I?
