Simply using a credit card network defeats the purpose of bitcoin.  You now have all the fees associated with exchanging fiat for bitcoin on an exchange and now you have standard credit card fees on top.

Doesn't this seem a bit like it could be used to attack whatever anonymity bitcoin has?  There are so many ways that personal information could be linked to a wallet if bitcoin was used everywhere that I would have to reconsider using bitcoin for everyday purchases.

I think a central bank of bitcoin should open up.  They could sell print a special paper wallet with a guaranteed amount of bitcoin on it; say cash equivalent of $1, 5, 10, 20 USD that you can use for circumstances like in a bar.

If the whole process is as follows then there is little value for users that don't already have bitcoin and if this going to use the credit card network companies will still have the same credit card fees as with fiat accounts meaning there won't be a savings in fees normally associated with bitcoin transactions.
1.  Acquire fiat
2. Buy Bitcoin
3. Preload your account/card with bitcoins
4. Buy something priced in fiat, this company will deduct bitcoins from your account and generate the fiat. Since there is no way that credit card companies are going to roll out entirely new credit card machines/network.

Won't there be a decrease in demand for each person that gets paid in bitcoins?  I can't buy bitcoins if I get paid in bitcoins, I would have to spend fiat savings to buy additional bitcoins at that point.  Perhaps I'm just underthinking the issues but I would think the people that would get paid in bitcoins would be the same people that already buy bitcoins.  I would figure that I would be giving up some choice also with my employer being my "exchange" since I now have no control over what value I'm "buying" bitcoins from them.

Realistically it would be fairly time consuming, but if there was a reason(say attempting to hire hitmen against kidnappers) they could pull it off.  All it would take would be a single mistake, that one time you bought something with your phone(you have now linked bitcoin traffic to your phone number) and that one time you didn't use tor correctly would be enough.

In those circumstances it is better to go to the bank. Stolen credit cards are covered under fraud and you can skip dealing with PayPal. When I had to do it I ended up with a balance of about -$2000 on paypal for a while.

Why would a closed loop of bitcoin cause the price to shoot up?  If I got paid in bitcoin and was able to spend bitcoin for the majority of my purchases I would never have to buy bitcoin.  It would seem that a complete system would have a large effect on the volume of bitcoins purchased with fiat.

Borrowing would be simple since they aren't spending anything, Just find someone who trusts you with a wallet to give you an address with X amount of coins in it as a loan. Add it to your list of "owned" addresses and now it looks like you have access to a greater amount than you actually have.  You can't take any of the borrowed ones because the person that you got them can just spill the beans and after the audit you can move them back to the the real owner and disguise it as "security measure".  And if the auditor didn't verify that they actually  can access the coins in storage then the whole thing is pointless.

I don't understand why people can't understand that investing in bitcoin companies is not the same as investing in bitcoin.  Proving VC money is the belief that the company will make a profit, not support for bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-05-08 22:54:25
There is no point for them to buy bitcoins. Companies are insulated from the price of bitcoin by charging a percentage fee.  If bitcoin goes to $1 they still will make the same amount of profit off each sale because the dollar amount is fixed for goods(the cash value  of 3% of a $10 sale is the same no matter if it is a whole bitcoin or .0001 bitcoin). If bitcoin dies they(bitpay and the like) can attempt to retool and become a paypal competitor.
Bitcoin also makes no money being held, it doesn't pay dividends and will never split.  You only have 1 opportunity to make profit off a sale and companies aren't looking for the risks associated with daytrading. It also wouldn't be prudent for large VC investments to purchase bitcoins off the market as it would be incredibly difficult to turn unrealized gains into realized.

Well i was only phrasing it that way for simplicity. I don't say that I preload my debit card with fiat, my card is only a reference to my account, and even a gift card doesn't actually contain any money it is just a reference to the balance in a database somewhere.

Taxes on Commodity Trading
You should receive a 1099-B Form from your broker before January 31. This form will state your profits and losses from the previous year’s commodity trading. Subtract the losses from the profits and that will give your capital gains. There are favorable tax rates for commodities as they are taxed at 60% long-term capital gains and 40% short-term capital gains. Long-term gains are capped at 15% and short-term gains are taxed at your ordinary tax rate, which depends on your adjusted income. You do not have to worry about accounting for and listing each individual trade on your tax returns. You just need to know your net profit or loss.
