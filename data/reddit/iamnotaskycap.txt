There is a thick layer of irony in your statement

Question -- if this man did not care about changing his real name -- why would he lie about his age on this profile? It says he's 38. Has it always said that?
It's a small detail, but strange nonetheless.

It is also an absolute shithole of a firm and is very shady in its business dealings.

Oh relax

Pretty unreal. Twitter is a cesspool.

Follow up -- you can always just deselect the 'Transfer' permission when making your keys if you don't trust us. That's perfectly reasonable and should help alleviate any concerns about your crypto going anywhere.

Yeah, you could always just select the 'View' and 'Trade' functionality when making your keys. I feel like this mitigates most people's concerns about their coins getting stolen.

Hey, fair enough -- this is putting a lot of faith in a third party. We take that seriously. Feel free to monitor the network traffic in and out of the app, and you'll see that it's all to and from Coinbase. In fact, I'll upload a video showing this in the next couple days and will post it as a reply here. We don't collect any personal or account data, don't even have servers, and aren't just "this guy", we are a real company that is trying to deliver an exceptional product. I absolutely look forward to the day that Coinbase releases OAuth for Coinbase Pro so this isn't even a question.

What if we referred to 1 mBTC as a "boot", since 1 mBTC = .001 BTC. The "i" in Bitcoin is the 1, and the two Os in boot represent the two zeroes in .001 BTC. 
1000 boots = 1 Bitcoin 
I'm just spitballin' here, but yes definitely something short and intuitive is needed.

You can take screenshots, but it tells the person that you took the screenshot. Pretty clever. It shames you into not taking them.
