OP did you eventually get your coin back?

OP did you do this yet? How were the fees?

Thank you. That is helpful information for explaining the fees and why I was confused on those. 
So, does this mean that my $50 is gone? Or will it at some point, be added to my wallet?
I intended on sending smaller amounts at a time so that I didn't risk losing everything all at once, since I am new to this and don't want to mess things up.

I'm a bitcoin newb. I've only been toying around with this since August. Please be gentle and help me understand what's going on here.
I recently bought a little bit of bitcoin from coinbase. I had read that I could use GDAX to transfer that money from coinbase/GDAX to my wallet and avoid the fees that I had been paying by sending it from coinbase to my wallet.
I sent a small test transfer (a buck or two) to make sure I did it OK. It took a while, but it came through a few hours later. So I send the second (remaining balance) over to my wallet from GDAX. Now my wallet is giving me the message for both transactions "the amount is too low to spend" (about $50). 
These transactions both have several confirmations.
Is my money lost, or will it ever be added to my wallet balance? Is there a way to "fix it"?

So if I am understanding correctly, it will end back up in my GDAX account?
I must not be explaining myself correctly...
I have another "too low to spend" amount from 9/30 that is just sitting there. Its for less than $2, no clue what fees were paid to XFR it from point A to point B. Its still sitting my my wallet listed as "too low to spend".

I know nothing about art, but I fucking love this.

I am not sure what this is. I've only been involved in the world of bitcoin since about August.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:19:19
How? Because when I did this, I ended up paying a ridiculous fee. Transferred $50 from Coinbase to GDAX and from GDAX to my wallet.

I'm not familiar with this chart you have posted. The transactions I have are listed as confirmed, but "too low to spend."
 
I have a total of three "too low to spend" transactions I have listed in my wallet. How do I go about "consolidating them into a segwit address"? 
Remember. Total n00b here.

For withdrawals but not transfers, correct? I’m still really new to how his works, but happy to learn. I didn’t see an option on where I change the fees on GDAX to send to my wallet.
My wallet shows the message “amount too low to spend.” 
I actually have several of these in my account. 
One was from Coinbase to copay 
One was from bread to copay
Two are from GDAX to copay
All of these have been confirmed.
