A traitor to people he said he was protecting. He's as much a patriot as Benedict arnold and deserves a traitors life in exile.

Good. People need to stop seeing him as some hero and see him for what he is. A traitor.

You could argue that, however our government is not a tyrannical king who live across an ocean. we also have plenty of day in legislation. I'm guessing you're an American? Then you would know we don't just vote in the president, we also vote in congressmen and senators who actually do more to create the laws then the president. is our system perfect? No, but it works a lot better than many places. And donating money to a criminal is not "standing up for your rights", it's a blatant crime. if he is such a patriot why run? Whistleblowing isn't illegal. Espionage is.

Hey thanks for apologizing dude. Honestly I understand your views. My friend holds very similar ones to the point of that exact same Ben Franklin quote. And now that I've had a couple days to reflect and research my answer. My main issue with snowden is he didn't completely read threw what he released. And reading all 50 000 pages would be rediculise. But I feel he should have studied what he had longr than what he did. That's why its not just whistleblowing its espionage which I looked up is a blanket term from the first world war and quite out of date. I'm happy we know for a fact the government watches us. I'm just one of the few people who don't care since they're not worried about the single human. It's groups, and generally ones they armed long ago the governments against

Also sorry if it seemed like I was trolling. I do actually believe these views. Strange but they're mine
