The government made it illegal, read a book.

You didn't say that he was wrong and state why, you just said he was incredibly stupid. Also if you think that Donald Trump is not a genius then I don't know where you were in 2016.

tcp/ip contains the layers within itself. That is not the case with lightning, it is a separate network and could replace Bitcoin if it failed with another chain to provide time stamping.

Lol, no man, come on. [
@_date: 2018-09-11 16:38:40
Lol, no, even if only merchants and miners had nodes, that still doesn't enable government control of the money. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 17:24:03
Yes, if a node goes offline while holding your transaction, you need to wait until the contract times out to get your money back. You clearly don't know how it works.
@_date: 2018-09-12 00:38:32
It requires tens of millions to become a miner, is it unreasonable to require them to invest more into hardware beyond just number crunchers? I don't see how you think it is reasonable to pay the millions in miner rewards for a floppy disk's worth of data every ten minutes meanwhile we are streaming 4k video at 15Mbps. Yes yes Bitcoin is different but Bitcoin is already in data centers run by professional companies, you are paying these millions to basically get away with doing minimal work.

Shhh mods are sleeping.

That is a dumb take because we had that before with bank notes.

the ascent of money
@_date: 2018-09-13 05:41:45
I am saying that you are not familiar with the history of money because it has happened before.
@_date: 2018-09-15 17:18:21
No, it is the history of money including when banks could issue their own. Back then even with "private money" as opposed to public, it was more stable and held value longer.
@_date: 2018-09-11 16:49:12
Are you going to open a lightning channel with coinbase or some random people who might turn off their node trapping your money there? Of course you will prefer coinbase so it will have its own routing nodes like exchanges that will handle the majority of the traffic. The only difference is now these routing nodes are money transmitters under the MSB definitions and require registration with the government.
@_date: 2018-09-11 18:12:18
You just said that wasn't how it worked but now you agree but it isn't a big deal? You kidding me? You expect this to be the payment system of the future but if your grocery store payment fails then you are SOL for another week. This is ridiculous man.
@_date: 2018-09-11 06:28:11
The point is that he is wrong that you would need terabyte blocks for a single city, as per the link, that is not true. The entire world can run on a terabyte block. But you are assuming that you would need this size of block this year, instead of in twenty years in which case, is a terabyte going to be that much?
@_date: 2018-09-11 06:39:46
Think about it, in twenty years are we going to have the same computing power as we do today? I doubt it. Does everyone want to validate blocks? Probably not, I think the majority just want to use digital money. The "everyone has to run their own node" seems delusional, I don't run my own email server or web hosting server even though hosting both of those would be better, cheaper, and easier.

Yes, I agree, The tri-lingual Ph.D who founded Lokad, a 40 person tech company after selling his first company is incredibly stupid. Nevermind, his university teaching, publications, and talks, he is just a big dumb dumb. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:05:41
If they have to open a channel to pay you then why not just do an on chain payment? Which will cost the same as opening a Channel.

Cobra really should be banned from this subreddit given how much he pushes bch on twitter.

Read the tweet, everyone who isn't antifa is pro-fa.
@_date: 2018-07-08 17:54:55
Roger didn't call him poor, he said " Andreas is one of the most eloquent speakers on the topic of Bitcoin, but if he had invested even $300 in bitcoin back in 2012, he’d be a millionaire today."  Which is a true statement then Anton came back spinning his whole "boo hoo I sold early" story. It is ridiculous.

I imagine that the developer would be the best person to answer this question.

Lol goof.

No, I am saying antifa is violent, not everyone who is against fascism, there is a clear and obvious difference.
@_date: 2018-07-08 14:20:03
Wasn't he begging for donations last year because he didn't have any Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2019-09-26 00:52:19
All antifa is violent, direct action is a core aspect of the ideology.
@_date: 2019-09-26 01:04:51
Dude, you are coping on this so far. You are doing the black bloc on word usage and it is pathetic. Everyone sees through it.
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:46:54
I imagine that you could use a time lock to prevent that but you can ask unwriter.
