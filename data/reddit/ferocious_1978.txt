Goddamn get your fact straight! Read the post above yours
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:47:54
What a fucked up situation
@_date: 2019-07-14 08:34:25
I don’t think 5 or 6k will ever reached again
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:40:40
Well check again
@_date: 2019-07-02 10:02:55
Come on now, rise again please piece of beauty!
@_date: 2019-07-01 11:05:01
Just one word sir, BRAVE!
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:07:06
Why take a loss. -240 is allready a big loss. Just Hodl my friend and when the smoke clears, perhaps you’ll be on the moon. Start packing
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:44:37
Damn!! Just Damn!!!
@_date: 2019-07-23 12:32:47
It’s dropping because wales selling and all the other panic sellers follows. It’s just a shame. But glad that i’m not the only HODLER out there.
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:29:10
Agree with that
@_date: 2019-07-17 09:58:18
We need to see a bounce back, just a small one to start with
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:43:43
Waiting for it to rise each moment now
@_date: 2019-07-27 02:39:46
I just want to know if the prophecy is right about the 16k rise in October
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:46:45
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:38:30
That’s why we all need to stick to the HODL term. But sadly there are always a lot of weakhands
@_date: 2019-07-01 02:37:03
Where did you bought your Crystal ball?
@_date: 2019-07-12 04:53:46
C’mon give me some green numbersss
@_date: 2019-07-15 06:04:45
Only if you give me one BTC
@_date: 2019-07-14 07:34:35
Just HODL and you’ll see!
@_date: 2019-07-27 03:24:37
Increase by 100 dollars will not give you profit.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:47:53
Where can i buy some btc fast and safe?
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:02:08
It looks pretty bad for the mothercoin
@_date: 2019-07-14 08:26:32
You just make me laugh for real.
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:47:25
Stop bleeding my friend and start healing
@_date: 2019-07-02 01:52:27
Damn, still movements downhill
@_date: 2019-07-01 00:29:34
Just read my post again. Those mentioned are short sellers.
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:59:16
If you want to see some green candle, give me a hell yeah!!
@_date: 2019-07-01 00:23:25
They’re selling to have some profit. If it goes down even more they will lose money
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:01:47
Yeah tell those with weak knees. Man yourself and HODL
@_date: 2019-07-31 13:27:55
So coldstorage isn’t ennough?
@_date: 2019-08-16 04:56:56
Also waiting for that to be happen
@_date: 2019-08-14 11:07:29
I don’t think this is the bottom yet. Let’s see what happends overnight
@_date: 2019-08-15 00:11:33
It’s pussy btw bitch
@_date: 2019-08-26 02:20:22
You’re so right.
@_date: 2019-08-07 22:54:45
Just let your hdd sync
@_date: 2019-08-22 18:42:44
Let see what happens today. A rise or dump again
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:46:03
Nothing is sure in life. That counts also for the value of btc. We know it can go every direction. Don’t come over and over to tell us that you were right all the time. If so, then i’m happy for you. I even would buy you some flowers if i knew you in reallife. Jees..
@_date: 2019-08-20 10:21:43
Don’t you mean 10200. Some red candles showing allready on the chart
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:50:07
Welcome back 9k
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:34:43
Not yet buddy. But will buy again very soon.
@_date: 2019-08-29 05:30:12
Hey buddy,
Love to have you here, but is it really necessary to predict the course of btc every single time again. Please keep it to yourself. Many of us thinks it’s annoying. Thanks
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:41:32
Keep your coins, don’t sell those.
@_date: 2019-08-13 10:20:40
Can you read? Read my question again and come with a proper answer
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:18:43
Here comes the pain!!
@_date: 2019-08-29 12:48:13
Yeah tell me about it
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:20:46
Buddy there is no guarantee at all. Do you really think is going to be a bullrun now? I don’t!
@_date: 2019-08-24 07:50:25
Speak to you in October
@_date: 2019-08-13 10:42:13
So btc is decreasen and bt*ch is increasen or stable arround $330. Really make sense, NOT
@_date: 2019-08-21 20:27:26
Give me an 9..5..0..0
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:30:02
Yeah you’re probably right. Can’t see it happen now. I think a couple of dips happens first
@_date: 2019-08-17 19:46:06
Yes sir
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:20:37
I hope you’re all wrong. It makes me sick al these negatif vibes here about btc decreases to 8.5 or less. Jesus you had your chance plenty of times to buy the dips. Just fuck you all
@_date: 2019-08-07 23:21:51
Just let it sync buddy
@_date: 2019-08-29 05:26:29
Well actually it’s stable arround 9700. So i don’t think it will go lower
@_date: 2019-08-15 00:05:33
Wtf it’s risen even faster
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:02:28
What webpage?
@_date: 2019-08-22 12:26:01
Please stop that BS
@_date: 2019-10-05 11:36:44
But you can’t stay away from reddit??
@_date: 2019-08-26 01:02:02
Pump is not going to last long.
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:35:51
Why should we have doubts. He allready had his  prediction right for April and July.
@_date: 2019-08-26 00:23:18
Well don’t know, but a bad sign to me.
@_date: 2019-08-07 07:28:48
Morning bitcoiners! Are we in for a dip or rise today
@_date: 2019-08-04 13:04:33
You did the right thing. Thumbs up to you bro!
@_date: 2019-08-24 19:52:03
Retarded or not a big dip is defintely on the way
@_date: 2019-10-28 12:38:09
Once when it goes up and second when it goes down?
@_date: 2019-10-05 11:49:46
If you’ve nothing to lose, just keep buying the dip.
@_date: 2019-08-04 20:28:15
Stop try to predict the future. Just enjoy the btc rise,
@_date: 2019-08-23 21:40:19
Not happen
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:04:27
@_date: 2019-08-09 04:57:40
I have a feeling that it’s going to happen today
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:33:33
@_date: 2019-08-12 09:24:05
Doge who? Sorry i eat, sleep and breath BTC
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:39:08
Omg can’t breath, please give me some oxygene
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:30:29
Oh boy, here we go downhill. Buckle up!
@_date: 2019-08-26 23:25:42
You’re allready rich if you’re healty these days.
@_date: 2019-08-10 10:48:12
Another day to reach 13 k
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:12:16
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:44:39
We’re keep dropping. Is it because of another sell?
@_date: 2019-08-23 12:53:55
Try another bank bro
@_date: 2019-08-09 01:51:11
Cut the crap, will you. We’re here to stay and that’s why we are Hodlers and if and i really mean IF Btc will die for some reason, then let it be.
@_date: 2019-08-31 21:03:55
Don’t be and give it a couple of weeks
@_date: 2019-08-15 00:12:51
And why am i a pussy, because i’ve deleted my message? Deleted because i had to reply it to another message instead of creating a new post dickhead
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:06:18
With day trading you will definitely lose your money
@_date: 2019-08-23 08:51:18
During this period it will repeat this dip towards October and then we’re good to go.
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:10:29
Bet or hope for
@_date: 2019-08-22 12:35:09
I’ll be rich and buy me a bigger house and Lambo
@_date: 2019-10-09 11:20:55
The best way is to stay away from reddit. All these negative mambo jambo speculations isn’t healthy
@_date: 2019-08-21 08:51:16
Reading your post makes me even want to buy some more coins LOL
And don’t come with the BS that i can’t afford btc
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:34:59
Guess a lot are selling
@_date: 2019-08-21 17:13:22
Keep dipping btc, just keep dipping!
@_date: 2019-08-16 23:56:35
Hoping for a dip to buy even more
@_date: 2019-08-26 00:36:12
Oh boy. Let me grab me some popcorn
@_date: 2019-08-14 13:07:37
Thanks bro, i know that my English is poor.
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:26:33
Yeah i think it’s going to dip again and form a bart
@_date: 2019-08-09 01:29:05
Ignore is the key bro
@_date: 2019-06-29 22:09:32
Yeah i think you’re right. It’s all in hands of the wales. If they want to increase in value they can do it right away. For me... I just made a lot of money only to catch the wave on the right time. It’s just a matter of buy and sell the make some money.
@_date: 2019-08-26 03:12:53
Buy high, sell low. Is this the way to trade on exchanges?
@_date: 2019-08-07 22:47:47
As long as you have the .dat file
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:18:26
Why is Bitcoin sv not effected?
@_date: 2019-06-07 13:26:57
It’s all about the Marketcap
@_date: 2019-06-13 07:14:51
What’s a bofa method?
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:26:15
Get your ass out of here...
@_date: 2019-08-11 17:50:16
everything’s rising except btc is annoying to see
@_date: 2019-08-06 22:58:55
@_date: 2019-06-22 22:09:43
What causes the drop? Is it the sells?
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:22:51
Very impressive. Just keep holding your balls in your hand while we enjoy our ride to the moon. Jesus, go fuck some where else with that crap. We’re here because we believe in BTC. 
Btw...if your friends tell you to eat shit, would you do that?
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:14:10
Is this a panic sell?
@_date: 2019-10-04 07:39:02
Second post
@_date: 2019-06-06 20:59:25
How or where to see all the pumps and dumps?
@_date: 2019-06-13 07:19:31
Is this the moment i suppose to laugh?
@_date: 2019-06-16 09:06:31
HODL your horses!
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:17:30
It’s red candle time!
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:17:16
100% fact! It just DON’T smell as nice.
@_date: 2019-06-05 13:06:01
Need to see some nature colour in the charts.
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:09:04
I guess Monday will be a new day for a rise again
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:16:32
Don’t worry, be happy and ofcourse HODL!
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:27:08
I think btc is stable at the moment. Nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2019-06-22 22:59:59
I’m in to HODL
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:16:14
Unbelievable stable and strong
@_date: 2019-08-17 15:12:22
My guess is that it will dip on Monday under 10k. If so, i’ll buy in a heartbeat more
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:42:38
I really don’t get it. Give me an example in numbers. Isn’t it to sell high and buy low?
@_date: 2019-06-05 05:26:55
Message of the day: Hodl and just catch the wave!
@_date: 2019-06-05 13:32:34
What you gonna do “red candle”, when i and all the BTC Maniacs run wild on you!!
@_date: 2019-06-07 11:29:34
Oh boy, let me get my moon gear. Don’t want to waist any time!
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:27:34
Keep rising babe!!
@_date: 2019-08-15 00:22:22
Ya mama biatch
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:07:42
Don’t you get less btc for the same amount?
@_date: 2019-06-06 07:25:41
Love to see that!
@_date: 2019-06-09 23:13:48
Heavy weather. Where is the sun?
@_date: 2019-06-21 21:14:18
Rise pleaseeeeeee!
@_date: 2019-06-30 05:22:09
Another day with same chart result.
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:47:19
Yeah me too. Holding my balls tight
@_date: 2019-06-06 15:54:13
I don’t know about you guys/girls. But to me it seems stable. Following the chart for a while now. Just hodl. Am i wrong?
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:35:59
You’re a example for many people. You just stick to that thought and one day you will succeed what you’re hoping for. Spread the word......HODL!!
@_date: 2019-06-18 16:57:13
Oh boy, what’s happening
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:14:33
The first day of the week buddy
@_date: 2019-06-29 10:36:03
Do you really think the wales won’t prevent for BTC to reach 1 milion? They’re allready disturbing  a lot of ATH moments.
@_date: 2019-06-11 23:46:08
Hoping for a big increase
@_date: 2019-08-09 15:54:18
And you don’t think any wales would read this thread.
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:35:25
If this stays till Monday then it is
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:22:15
Really fucked up this
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:22:40
It’s not Gandalfs, but Gollums fault
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:04:29
And why is that? Any source info would be appriciated
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:12:50
Why is it still dropping?
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:17:24
Well at least have some salad with it
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:31:26
I guess. Fucked up!
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:36:15
What’s the reason for the drop?
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:38:49
I’ve been watching the charts very closely since the 10k and seen a lot of movement, but finally it’s stable
@_date: 2019-06-13 07:17:28
Rise pretty young thing
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:30:43
This must be the feeling those had on the Titanic
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:30:57
You trade btc for what?
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:18:40
Damn! Is it red candle day today
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:25:41
I don’t get it. It just had a little dip and you guys act like the whole market crashed. Get your self together and enjoy the ride upwards.
@_date: 2019-06-12 00:04:02
So you don’t have any btc at this moment and sitting on your cash to buy the dip?
@_date: 2019-06-04 07:46:28
Why on earth btc gold keeps their value?
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:42:13
Don’t be weak! Just HODL!
@_date: 2019-06-18 08:00:52
Don’t freak out. Just a little correction
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:12:25
For a dead coin i still see some big cash on my balance these days!!
@_date: 2019-06-06 20:55:30
It’s just a matter of time my friend for us to rise again.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:19:58
Just HODL.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:24:51
Damn i thought the dip was over
@_date: 2019-06-04 21:39:19
This is exactly what the wales are hopen for. People panic sell their coins and a lot don’t have the balls to hodl and to play it hard. This pumping and dumping by wales will always be. The most of coins are in their possesion. Just Hodl!!!
@_date: 2019-06-25 07:31:18
Oh boy, need to see this.
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:17:49
Yeah keep downvoting bunch of morons.
@_date: 2019-09-06 16:57:01
Keep on risen
@_date: 2019-09-06 18:04:32
They’re rapen the whole process for the hodlers
@_date: 2019-09-09 12:54:51
Have anyone of you ever bought futures? How does it work?
@_date: 2019-09-18 19:27:20
2000 or 20.000?
@_date: 2019-09-04 04:53:49
Or the rise
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:12:02
My English is not that good! So now that you know that grab some piece of shit out of your asshole and eat it piece of shit!!!
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:07:47
Don’t think so
@_date: 2019-09-29 16:33:38
What you gonna do when BTC run wilds on you!!
@_date: 2019-09-25 19:17:40
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:20:06
My mistake!!! Stop eating out of your ass. You’re getting high from your own shit. Damn!!!
@_date: 2019-09-03 10:22:37
Try to ask the same question in google and you’ll find out
@_date: 2019-09-19 10:29:03
I’m wishing for a serious community without crying all the time about dips in value. Jees, grow up. Sick of tired of all these kids here.
@_date: 2019-09-19 09:51:07
The truth will be revealed soon brothers!
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:04:00
Thanks, you too buddy
@_date: 2019-09-03 01:58:56
Looks like we’re really heading for the 16k. Long live the prophecy
@_date: 2019-09-21 03:41:13
Where to?
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:42:32
So the rise didn’t last long
@_date: 2019-09-06 16:53:54
You said it well...., years back. And it only touched 20k and you’re talking about 100k. Can you count? Well don’t count a 100k for 2020
@_date: 2019-09-19 08:44:07
For those who needs to cash out, do it. You need to realize that investing is not meant for everybody. It’s for those who laughs at dips and still live there life’s as usual. In the meanwhile we all know time for us investors to laugh even louder will come soon. No hard feelings...
@_date: 2019-09-21 02:18:41
If you need your money, then step out. You’re going to lose even more when daytrading
@_date: 2019-09-09 07:33:37
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?? ��
@_date: 2019-09-19 09:43:29
If you don’t have confidence in Btc, please do yourself a favour and gtfo of here and buy some lego with your little penny’s. This is the place where the big boys plays.
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:49:05
@_date: 2019-09-09 08:10:00
The people downvoting my post haven’t got any humor left. Try to laugh once in a while. And if you lost money in crypto then get the F out of here, because you’re not worth investing into it.
@_date: 2019-09-03 02:13:56
If you can miss it, then buy. On the long run there always be profit
@_date: 2019-09-08 11:43:15
BCH still remains strong. What’s that all about?
@_date: 2019-09-03 04:45:11
C’mon now 11k where ya at!
@_date: 2019-09-07 12:48:16
You better don’t cheat on her or else you will end up with that same ring with stone in your face!!
@_date: 2019-09-21 22:24:07
Nah, those days are over. We will never see $8k again. It perhaps will drop, but never $8k or even lower.
@_date: 2019-09-17 15:20:59
Yeah, let him go back to do some electrician job. LOL
@_date: 2019-09-03 12:30:36
Oh boy. Can’t wait till October.
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:00:52
I’m not saying every exchange is vulnerable to hacks. It’s just in case if it is.
@_date: 2019-09-21 21:45:03
And when do you predict the bullish sign?
@_date: 2019-09-21 19:34:24
Where do you have your account. Is that on an exchange?
@_date: 2019-09-17 18:20:03

After 10 years we’re still running wild. That’s the biggest sign ever. Keep investing in BTC
@_date: 2019-09-18 17:22:46
You’ll witness next week
@_date: 2019-09-30 04:46:06
What a mess
@_date: 2019-09-03 02:16:02
Bleed? Don’t you get it? Altcoins depends on BTC. If BTC rise so do altcoins and vice versa.
Binance coin is a example of it. Was bleeding a lot and look at it now
@_date: 2019-09-06 18:01:17
Why would you sell your coins now that we almost reached 11k
@_date: 2019-09-06 21:04:47
Probably because of the dip. Don’t worry once it rises again she will empty your nut sack or you can sent her towards me (overseas)
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:39:52
Why is that?
@_date: 2019-09-06 16:57:51
Do you want to bet for a couple of btc?

Sent him a message that you agree ��
@_date: 2019-09-09 11:28:20
What’s up with al these downvotes? There are members who asks for advise and you keep downvoting their posts. I’m getting the feeling that a lot of kids hanging out here with their penny’s to invest in BTC.
@_date: 2019-09-06 16:47:51
Let it first pass the old record of 20k after that everything is possible
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:06:31
Don’t think so (sorry was mentioned for a reply)
@_date: 2019-09-05 15:59:22
Isn’t it to buy low and sell high? Explain please what you mean by buy high sell low
@_date: 2019-09-01 17:23:41
How much do you want to buy?
@_date: 2019-09-03 04:40:58
Say it with your chest ~ Kevin Hart ��
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:45:18
Because you can lose all your coins when the exchange get hacked.
@_date: 2019-09-03 13:22:25
Noo, green $$$$$ October.
@_date: 2019-09-21 21:46:42
Why don’t you buy a hard wallet and sent coins to there and vice versa
@_date: 2019-09-11 08:24:33
Do you really think that we’re a bunch of morons?
@_date: 2019-09-10 07:59:49
I’m using coincap for price chart but it seems that it’s less accurate then other sites. What’s the most reliable site or app?
@_date: 2019-09-09 13:01:14
Why is that?
@_date: 2019-09-04 11:43:57
Don’t do anything, just hang on tight
@_date: 2019-09-18 18:52:53
Yes sir
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:30:38
Damn. We’re going down again
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:27:01
Don’t go lower now, you need to rise!!
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:51:06
Wow. A lot of red numbers. Sad, just sad. We just Hodl and see what happends
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:54:40
I’m not a hardcore btc user, but know for sure that btc has potential to grow big time in a matter of time. If this thread don’t mean anything to you, why are you posting here anyway then.
@_date: 2019-05-23 00:33:23
Is there a reason for all this?
@_date: 2019-05-26 01:25:47
At the moment we’re pretty strong and stable. Hopefully any big rise soon.
@_date: 2019-05-31 07:30:38
Not today son
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:32:25
Glad i sold at 13.000. Made some good profits. It’s sad to see the coin is falling
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:54:32
And still going downhill
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:57:13
It’s still dropping
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:08:40
Oh men. What’s going on?
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:55:54
