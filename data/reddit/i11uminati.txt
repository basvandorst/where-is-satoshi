Yep, there goes over $2K I had invested in renting their servers. I was about to invest more, but I'm glad I didn't. With some luck, we may make back a small portion of what we paid.

I paid ~$2500 for minion servers with an estimated delivery of February 2014.
It's September 2014 and I've yet to receive login info after asking support several times.
I moved on months ago and took it as an investment loss. They're in another country so it's not even worth litigating.

Welp, I'm a complete retard. I preordered from BTCFGPA several months ago, but of course they went under. 
Then I preordered from BFL a few days ago. Looks like I'll be cancelling soon.

Thanks for the encouraging words. I just wish there was an easier way to exchange USD to BTC. I'm trying a cash deposit through bitinstant today, but at a 4% fee and having to go to a physical location, it's not as ideal.

Is it goofy, or is it a pattern, such as when BTC value rises over a certain %, it's automatically fraud? I wonder.

Email sent. Thanks!
Also, since I sent the email, I called my bank to confirm that I have unlimited ACH transfers per month, in case there was a limit causing the cancellations.

Awesome! I'll check these out.

You were supposed to destroy the Sith, not join them!

Good god, this is terrible. They shouldn't let 1st-day interns make infographics. Check out [futuretimeline.net]( instead.

Not true

True, and there was a post predicting 11% inflation until 2016. It looks like I'll do that today on my way to the gym.

Exactly. I had 3 orders cancelled totaling 30 BTC. These orders were placed when 1BTC was $20. BTC jumped to $22.50 and now suddenly I'm high risk. By the way, all of my January orders went through fine (when bitcoin was relatively steady).

Months ago, I purchased from BTCFPGA, and then they went under.
Then a few days ago I ordered a BFL. If that never arrives, I'm just going to China and making one.

My experience [I posted](
In the end, coinbase approved 3 out of my 5 transactions, so I was happy. I still "lost" a bit, but it seems impossible to get approved on MtGox no matter how many times I send them my damn water bill and drivers license.

I may regret it, but I'm holding for about a month to see what happens. I'm prepared to lose whatever money I put towards high risk investments like this (just the $1300 one). Also BTCFGPA refunded my money after I cancelled when their shit hit the fan, so I'll take the chance.
The reason I didn't choose Avalon is that their units are not efficient power-wise and have other design/quality flaws.
But I see what you mean about subreddits being swayed by invested users. I see this sometimes in but it's subtle.
In the end, I wonder how many people who aren't associated with an ASIC company will actually break even with an ASIC miner.
