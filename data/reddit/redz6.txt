Judging by your posts you are against Bitcoin. So not sure why you're in this subreddit. But anyway...
Bitcoin would need to have roughly the same market cap as gold to be worth $500,000 (about 8 trillion). That's not impossible.

Why does almost everyone in this thread seem to hate Bitcoin lol

Because banksters are heavily tied to fiat and hate the idea of a non fiat, decentralized currency. So it’s predictable that they will call Bitcoin things like ‘Bubble, ponzi, fraud, crash’ etc.

The problem is there are so many scams, forex brokers etc. trying to trick people into their platform. Most new people to Bitcoin probably end up getting scammed when they try to purchase it.

I read that the Bitcoin market has to be worth 1% if the gold market for 1btc to = $400,000. I’m not good at maths though so im not sure if it’s correct.

"Americans are keen to share stories about their success and are happy for the others that made profits."
Is that why you're all obsessed with suing eachother?

You never know Bitcoin might fall 30% in the next week so don't gloat.

I've been speaking with McAfee personally (he's a genius).  He thinks Bitcoin will reach $1 million in 12 months. Whether it actually will or not i'm not sure.

Keep the tears flowing, go back to your Bcash forum ��

They are specifically targeting Bitcoin and called it a bubble multiple times.

Wouldn't argue with that:

Well what do you expect? Most Americans are in debt, have to slave away to pay off their mortgage etc. If they can find a quick way out of that by suing then many will.

"Craig Wright has been ordered to give half his bitcoin holdings to the estate of David Kleiman, which alleges the men were partners in starting the cryptocurrency."

So the whole lawsuit against him is just for fun then...
