Actually when it is contentious the other side generally challenges the legitimacy of the vote, at least in recent times. My point is XT does not scale bitcoin in any meaningful fashion as you can see in this  for this and governance issues XT is dead in the water. The Core Devs are working to actually scale the network capacity for the long term. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 19:15:48
Changing the block size is one line of code but just changing the block size does not scale bitcoin. Look at the timeline,  you will see how long it will take to get to PayPal's current TX/s.  Bigger blocks will come when a real long term scaling solution becomes clear. Obviously, the network has voted against XT  so lets look at other options that will actually scale.

For small amounts SPV is like keeping you money in your back pocket, which is ok, not very secure and does nothing to support the network.  Bitcoin allows you to be your own bank when you run your own node whether it is XT, Classic, UL, Core or your own fork -running a full node is the only way users have a voice.

If you are concerned about the future of bitcoin and store your coins in a SPV or a 3rd party like a Coinbase wallet the best thing you can do is run a full node and store your coins there. That full node can be XT or Classic or whatever but that is the only way for users to "vote". I run a CORE full node because that is what I support but you can support what you like, this is how bitcoin is supposed to work.
@_date: 2016-01-25 11:11:22
Yes! If you are trusting a 3rd party you aren't using bitcoin correctly.

Thanks for the responses. The semantics of on vs off chain scaling are getting a bit muddied and convoluted. I think of USD exchange transactions as off chain for trading purposes we make a deposit and then the exchange has control of our coins while we make transactions in their database. The then coins come back "on-chain" (even though they never left, maybe "transactions" is the appropriate term?)at the time of withdrawal.

@_date: 2016-12-02 13:00:24
Sorry it is more philosophical than technical, my understanding has been the coins will never leave the bitcoin network or change into LN tokens or what have you, they remain bitcoin on the the bitcoin chain but in a channel. Which to me ≠"off chain"...

@_date: 2016-12-12 13:48:19
You get 2% back minus your APR then pay 3% again on next purchase.

It is a vote to possibly change one of the fundamental properties of bitcoin. Will Coinbase and other Classic supporting exchanges give all their users a consider.it account with every purchase so they can vote? How will that work? A sybil attack has already occurred, how will another one be prevented? So many questions, so little answers with facts.
@_date: 2016-02-05 22:56:37
If 95% is too high why was it used on previous BIPs? The first use of 75% fork attempt appears to be with the failed XT fork.

Yeah I thought it was a good read. Straight forward no FUD.
@_date: 2016-02-14 17:59:26
It could definitely use an update and if you check the source on the 90% to 99% figure it was more of an estimation made by Adam Back.  
* "Pure offchain is a weak form of layer2.  Its running today and maybe its handling 90-99% range
of all transactions right now (mostly in exchanges for example)"
I wonder if anyone has done research into the actual figures?

I live in a large tech oriented city in the PNW, the best connection I can get regardless caps at 300gb/month 100down 10up. Additional gbs are $10/month... I would have to get separate line to run a full node.
@_date: 2016-02-11 07:00:09
75% triggers a 28 day grace period. It's actually at 750/1000 blocks not hashing power, after the grace period all nodes/miners/wallets that have not upgraded stay on current network, while those who upgraded to bitcoinClassic are now on the classic network. Classic and XT's low thresholds and short grace periods are not in line with [BIP34's]( guidelines and are one of the most contentious parts of Gavin's proposals.
@_date: 2016-02-03 06:39:42

BIP34 laid out clear guidelines for 95%  and the author is one of the classic devs. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 00:57:26
I would send a new user to r/bitcoin or r/btc without hesitation. r/bitcoin is mostly for promoting bitcoin and if you look at r/btc you can see a good use case for moderation, if helping promote bitcoin is your goal. r/btc has a clear agenda. There are better, more informed places than reddit to look into the block size debate like the dev-list or even twitter.
@_date: 2016-02-25 16:59:18
My impression has always been, if you don't have your keys you are ignoring one of bitcoin's main features and trusting a 3rd party with your coins. No legal system required if you run your own node...
@_date: 2016-02-09 18:32:22
I wasn't saying it didn't, it is mostly for new/casual users. Blocksize debate should be held elsewhere like on the dev-list, scaling bitcoin confs, and other subreddits. Now we have large figures in the space like Brian Armstrong and Roger Ver promoting r/btc but it is mostly people complaining about r/bitcoin, Blockstream or spreading misinfo about this or that. Like right now the  post in r/btc is misinfo about Adam Back. It was actual Gavin who was against the 2mb

Consider.it is what they mean by bringing democracy to bitcoin. Anyone can sign up for an account and vote. This is the bitcoin classic governance model. Their "road map" is according to the site, the only info we have to go on - "In the future we will continue to release updates that are in line with Satoshi’s whitepaper &amp; vision, and are agreed upon by the community." There appears to be less than 100 people signed up to vote and they have already voted on the 21 million cap.

@_date: 2016-02-11 17:06:53
750/1000 is exactly that, hash power is another metric. XT peaked 8/1000 blocks twice. How much hash power was that? 0.8%? More or less. You have to factor in lucky streaks, propagation time etc
@_date: 2016-02-13 03:39:08
I thought this was intriguing given today's legal discussions on forks. Then I read Brian Armstrong's slideshow presentation and the part where says hard forking bitcoin will make the price go up and wondered about the legality of such a statement. Here's a screen shot 
@_date: 2016-02-10 19:12:22
Make sure you read this article. 
"His startup Bloq Inc. charges customers $3,000 to $5,000 a month to develop new features for blockchain software and have access to 24/7 customer support. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has agreed to sell Bloq's services to its clients, Garzik said. "That opens up a lot of doors for us early in the company's lifetime," he said. "Companies know who to call at 3 a.m. if the blockchain is melting down.""
@_date: 2016-02-10 21:17:27
Safe as is in- Why no compromise on the 75% 28 day trigger? Have 4mb blocks been tested? For how long? Link? Why was J Toomim removed as a dev(lead) on the project? What influence does the "facilitator" have?  
@_date: 2016-02-05 20:46:57
The arbitrarily chosen 75% trigger is not "effectively complete consensus". 95% is as defined by past BIPs.

Mainstream consumers are used to paying 2-3% everytime they use Visa/Mastercard. $0.30 + 2.9% if using PayPal. $0.50+3% if debit under $10. 10%+ if pulling $20 from an ATM. At least in America.

It's been at 124p for a day or 2 with a low of 109p, the highest I saw was 176, right around when they made their big "we're running BU" campaign. Also, of note, at or near the peak, they claimed one 1/3 of hash rate was their's.

Probably why will not comment on Unlimited.

That network cost is built into the cost of the product or service you are purchasing.
@_date: 2016-10-18 13:45:23
That does not mean credit card fees do not exist.
@_date: 2016-10-27 16:03:46
That variance has nothing to do with transaction volume. Sometimes blocks are found in less than a minute sometimes it takes more than an hour.
@_date: 2016-10-31 15:47:06
Interesting, thanks!!
@_date: 2016-10-27 13:06:09
Thats what I usually do.
@_date: 2016-10-31 13:55:47
I always thought to pool operator made the most in that relationship. Don't they take a % off the top?
@_date: 2016-10-23 14:10:13
Apparently the goal was to try and gain another 6% of BU hashing power so they would have 16% and 16=80% so scaling would be settled forever. I'm paraphrasing here's the quote 
@_date: 2016-10-27 00:13:00
Wait a few minutes.
@_date: 2016-10-18 01:48:22
Merchants build it into their pricing so really the consumer pays for it.
@_date: 2016-10-23 14:30:56
I have no idea, I was just paraphrasing that ViaBTC guy, none of it makes sense to me :)
@_date: 2016-10-11 12:57:07
Please, do tell, these facts.
@_date: 2016-10-05 14:41:13
Motherboard tends to bash bitcoin, I wonder if they will be pro zcash.
@_date: 2016-10-31 14:05:55
It remains to be seen if BU can get 20% let alone 75%. Did it even make it to15% before dropping below 10%? Regardless, fork attempts like these we have seen in the past with much better dev teams behind them had the most support right at the beginning. BU's support is already starting to dwindle. Look at an XT node chart for comparison fractal. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 13:19:58
Do you trade at all?
@_date: 2016-10-19 21:17:34
Thanks, that was my suspicion.
@_date: 2016-10-11 12:58:18
That's the same forum that had the Terminator plan right?
@_date: 2016-10-28 19:51:04
Can you make a slide for Unlimited?
@_date: 2016-10-31 14:23:46
Right, then you blamed a bunch of "old money scams" on "bitcoins incentives" and they are 2  different things.
 
@_date: 2016-10-18 01:48:39
Ignorance is bliss.
@_date: 2016-10-31 13:59:39
That's the money space in general.
@_date: 2016-10-31 14:14:36
The same scams are in the money space and existed before bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-19 20:56:17
I've asked around but haven't received any answers from the BU dev team-- has this -choose your block size emergent consensus- been implemented on a test net somewhere?
@_date: 2016-10-25 16:11:19
[This graph](  made for XT's block enlargement path shows we would reach 1000tps around 2030 and would need 1gb or so, blocks.
@_date: 2016-10-19 20:24:46
So, you don't think immutability had anything to do with people wanting to continue with an unedited chain? 
@_date: 2016-10-05 16:48:09
Did motherboard invested in zcash? Or do you have a link to zcash investors? I jokingly called it E-coin on twitter but the more I hear about it the more it sounds like it.
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:31:24
That article was pretty bullish
@_date: 2016-10-31 14:10:14


The fraud that has occurred with bitcoin, happens in most areas of the money space and is not limited to crypto and not(too closely) related bitcoins incentives. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:46:38
 link to the super secret bot
@_date: 2016-07-08 16:40:30
Are any of them on twitter? I've only found one bitcoin ceo that fits that description.
@_date: 2018-12-24 14:56:26
The fees are too high.
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:43:19
He was talking about BCH hitting 1million not bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-07-26 13:27:29
Last I heard there were less than 300 shops and yeah, its pretty clunky.
