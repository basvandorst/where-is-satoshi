Serious question about accepting bitcoin
Seeing that bitcoins can be traced throughout their transactional life, as a business accepting bitcoin, how can you do so with the real threat of 'tainted coins' being used to pay you for your goods or services?
Theres plenty of stolen bitcoin out there with thieves who are looking for ways to unload it. If I had just stolen some, I'd just buy whatever I could with it. So why or how is it possible to remain safe with this threat?

I think the next major bitcoin price move will be in the vecinity of October 31
This is when Brexit must happen yes or yes, and the likelihood of things coming out alright are basically zero. It's gonna hurt Britain a lot, especially a no deal brexit, it's gonna hurt the EU, and that might be why they have gone ahead and lowered their interest rate now, before the storm. 
Once Britain and the EU start feeling the hurt, it can easily spread worldwide. At this point, the stock market is peak levels. Longest bull run in history. All it takes is one teeter - tottering of a large economy and everyone is going to be running for cover. And bitcoin will pump real high.
Haven't heard anyone mention this in regards to bitcoin price, would love to hear your thoughts

Is what's at stake on brexit the national sovereignty issue? It's a coalition to create a larger seamless market and gain benefits the same way tmobile and sprint are trying to merge together.
I don't understand the brexit situation and don't know anyone with skin in the game, like any Briton,or even any Europeans in it to know it. Anyone out here who knows something about it mention it here

It is such a great listen and relevant for today. 
It is easy to get lost in the day to day price and tie Bitcoin sentiment to the price alone, but when you hear someone explain it with such a broad and deep command you realize the macro level importance that Bitcoin is

Because Mueller report clearly shows crimes committed but is respectful of the office of the president.
As president, his financial records are being withheld from the house committee investigating into his Financials. 
But as a private citizen he will be brought to justice 
So he must win reelection and will do whatever. 
Country's priorities are not his priorities. This is why he is so desperately attempting to influence the Fed, which he feels is the easiest way to juice the economy. 
He is continuing the trade war because he feels it is easy to win.

Once you decide Bitcoin is something you believe in, and have been awakened to, you must act immediately. 
When I bought in I remember my hang up was regarding coinbase fees, they're so high! Maybe if I get into coinbase pro I can save on the fees. 
I said no way im doing this now. Had I waited and gone through the process for coinbase pro, I would have lost out way more than the fees I would have saved. 
It is the same now. Bitcoin is strong and stable at the threshold of 12k. Practically every day's news further adds credibility to bitcoin. Another trump tweet and things go frigging haywire. 
Just do it.

Every day now we'll be experiencing a 10% increase, more or less. China is beginning to buy up bitcoin but in a very discreet manner, just gonna put about 5 Billion dollars a day in it. That raises it but not too drastically. 
Its crazy how everything points to Bitcoin as the obvious currency of choice. 
Also crazy that Jack Dorsey says Bitcoin will be the currency of the future,an American CEO who runs not one but two public companies and basically is saying the USD will not the global reserve currency of the world in the next 10 years.
All this is just to say we have reached the tipping point. The tipping. Point.

The fact that Satoshis are 8 decimal places away means that even at a 100k per bitcoin price, a Satoshi is worth about 11 cents
At a million its worth a dollar
What's great about this is the fact that it can actually be a real currency when it gets to that level. A dollar for a Satoshi. 
People wonder and think if only they would have gotten in when Amazon started, or southwest, or Berkshire.... 
We are in the embryonic stages of getting in early into straight up a CURRENCY. There is no asset out there with a greater upside than bitcoin, and has not been for over 100 years. 
Anyone have any idea of something in history that can claim to rival Bitcoin's end game? 
It's true we are not there yet but no one can look and deny that the track record of over 10 years puts it in real contention 
Would love to hear any thoughts

Amazing that in today's world savings are seen as such a bad thing
Spend and invest. Forgetting about bitcoin for a sec, say you're a doctor and are clearing an extra 20k a month burning a hole in your pocket. Are you investing that yourself? Or are you employing a portfolio manager to do it for you. Or maybe you want to put it in real estate
It ends up being a job to put your money to work. This is what inflationary currency encourages
Back to bitcoin, deflationary in nature, makes you realize that maybe I don't need to spend all this money on X thing, because knowing it will appreciate over time encourages savings
Savings are good.

Excellent post, well thought out and cogently delivered.
I would say that regarding your concerns, they are actually good news for Bitcoin. 
Coinbase reporting to the IRS - there is only one way Bitcoin becomes legitimate, and that is by becoming legitimate. Of course you will need to pay taxes and report it. Otherwise how can it be taken seriously.
This is the area where the Winklevoss twins have made their greatest contribution, by legimitizing Bitcoin and bringing it to the table of varied investment vehicles. 
And in terms of Libra, it is also great for Bitcoin. Libra is centralized. A completely different animal than Bitcoin. One which has some of the advantages, and that will become clear, and it's use widespread to FBs 2 billion users. Once familiar with Libra, it will be clear Libra is NOT Bitcoin. Understanding why that is will become much clearer and easier to a population practically living with a Libra stable coin 
Always the hardest thing with Bitcoin is to play the long game and not get stuck on the daily. Which is hard because we here frequent this thread on a.... 
Daily basis
But this is why your post is great, because it actually expresses some well thought out points.
@_date: 2019-08-15 17:47:48
Depends when
Like in a week? 
A month? 
A year? 
5 years? 
What's your threshold, because anything before a year it is likely to crash multiple times hard, however, since the large uptick, the downward swings have not breached 9k. Seems like that is a barrier that is "safe" but ya never know
Remember the halvening! Can you hold til then at least? This will add a nice bump to the price. 
Zoom out a bit and don't check prices so often. 
I am also talking to myself here. In fact I am basically only talking to myself in a public forum.

Seeing Libra from the consortium of businesses involved, like Facebook, PayPal, Visa, USV Ventures, among some other very Heavyweight companies, it gives them power. They can create a closed circuit currency and basically become their own government. They promise 1 to 1 backing in a Swiss bank account but they understand that this is the same premise Central Banks started out with, and eventually rolled back the 1 to 1 ratio to a much looser ratio. This may or may not happen but once they are able to roll it out and it takes a life of its own they understand that their constituent base is larger than any single country. It is all conjecture as to how it evolves, but Libra has a near term potential to change a lot of industries, create new ones, and change the global financial landscape. This is its purpose, to swing the power firmly in the hands of tech companies, as well as truly deploy an ecash system on a global scale. 
In regards to what the IRS does, in their eyes they just have to keep an eye on those cashing out of the big exchanges. They don't need wallet information, since you have to move from your wallet into coinbase for example, and then into your bank account. Once you cross the bridge back into fiat, there's the IRS with their binoculars. 
Go hard and stay long. Everything points to this being a seminal time. We have brexit end of October, a trade war brewing with Trump amply hyping the concepts of currency manipulation for the masses, and with each mention, the collective mental understanding of fiat takes another hit. 
Then we have the halvening around may of next year. 
The time to jump in is now. And if you're in, you're on the spaceship.

It seems like every day there's a new benchmark set for Bitcoin. This one here is absolutely shocking, because this is the kind of thing Bitcoin maximalists have been saying 'in the future, people will.... BE OUTRIGHT PAID THEIR SALARIES IN BITCOIN!!' and thats about the time that any level headed listener rolls his eyes and realizes this speaker has downed his Koolaid in a single shot, slammed the glass on the table and wiped his mouth with the backside of his hand. 
But in the future of September 2019 this is reality. 
It is quite unbelievable. 
Reminds of how bamboo is planted and above the dirt looks like nothing is happening. Then all of a sudden it grows nearly a foot a day and reaches 20 feet in a couple of weeks. How does it happen? All the roots are spreading underneath until it all is in place. Then- boom.

This is not a good idea my man
Loans need to be paid back on a schedule. You could ask bitcoin if it's willing to cooperate with your repayment schedule. It might not though. 
Loans require collateral, as ain't no one loaning you money without a hard asset behind it, usually your house. Assuming you own one (and have at least 30% equity in it, to pull out 10% only, as banks will want that 20% cushion) then you would quite literally be betting the house on bitcoin.
Look- Bitcoin is going to go up. And likely soon. But would you sleep at night when you see a hard decline in price for seemingly no reason, and at such an acute degree that it looks like bitcoin is going to 0 in 4 days if this degree of sell off holds up?
Put in what you can. Bitcoin will reach 500k to 1 mill per coin in 5 to 10 years (or less, or more). That is a 50-100x return. But that is only for those who can hold their investment and not panic because their outlay was too steep to bear.
If you mentioned this idea to anyone in your family I presume they would straight up hit you upside the head, and so they should and so would I. 
Take it easy. See the very long term potential over the tantalizing short term gains.

Coinbase aint bad and although their fees are pretty high, they are very safe and the market leader from my understanding. Aside from this, if you are expecting the price to rise and keep on rising like it presently is, you will lose more from not acting than from the fees you will be paying. Just do it already. This morning BTC was at 11K now its 11.7K. It'll keep rising but just jump in already

I'm not sure exactly what you mean, but PayPal recently invested in a startup that is using blockchain to give users control of their own identity without having to have middlemen like Facebook.
Its called Cambridge Blockchain. 
It seems like to me this might be what you're talking about 
Of course it is a massive deal for PayPal to be investing in stuff like this. They have been remarkably shy on actual Bitcoin though. But I think it's similar to what guys like Lloyd Blankfein and Jamie Dimon are like, they just can't be sellouts of their own banking systems that have done so much for them

As a business owner, I recently began accepting bitcoin payments. The nature of my business is such that we sell our goods to a lot of international buyers. 
The first case of bitcoin I received, was from a customer in Canada. This was great because previously he had a hard time sending money here. 
The second was last night, when I received a BTC payment from a customer in Ecuador. He had sent a partial amount of the total due via western union, which meant I had to go to the hood to a check cashing store to retrieve it. He wanted to send another 2 WU payments. When I told him I would accept bitcoin, the transfer was completed and in my possession last night. 
Turns out I gained on the price increase, but in reality the reason why I accept it is because anyway I want BTC to hold. It would be much harder to justify if I needed to exchange it right away, but I know it is in a small portion of my transactions, and I know in the long run it will appreciate, and that it helps certain customers out a lot to offer it. 
So there are still drawbacks and I would never use it exclusively but being how it is, I am happy with the versatility and speed of it.

how bout that BITCOIN DOE'
@_date: 2019-08-12 19:15:03
We have hit a lull in price action so let's revert to the fundamentals to keep our excitement and mentality about Bitcoin strong :
Bitcoin has surged from around 3700 in March to about $11,300 at the time of this writing. To a lot of people on this sub that have gotten in more recently may not have enjoyed so much of that upside while on the Bitcoin rollercoaster. But it is worthwhile to remember the trajectory this is on. 
Bitcoin is by no means finished. Why? 
There is an active trade war and CURRENCY war (not my words!) between the top two countries in the world (at least I believe China is 2nd but its def up there amirite) that's just coming from a simmer to a rolling boil. New tariffs on September 1st. Talks breaking down. Rhetoric cranking the bolts tighter and tighter. 
Hong Kong protests are peaking. Hong Kong Airport closed down due to protests. Protesters suffering headshots and at least one protester blinded, shots fired execution style, police brutality at all time highs. This makes China fight a war on two fronts which will create faster imbalances in decision making which will continue to ratchet up tensions. 
Brexit coming end of October, do or die. Incredibly sensitive situation that has a massive question mark behind door # oct31. How will medicine get through? Food? Snap elections? Deal with USA? All impossible to tell and they're just speeding up the UK train as it heads directly off the cliff. No doubt impacting Bitcoin due to worldwide instability and wobbling currencies. 
US bull market of historic length beginning to show signs of slowing down. Had its biggest one day drop last Monday in over 2 years and 6th biggest one day drop ever. Markets continue to decline. 
All this is brewing before the May 17th 2020 halvening which will create more bitcoin scarcity and drive up price. 
The fact that bitcoins price has sustained after that $500 drop means only one seller sold. Everyone else is not panic selling.
I believe this is because everyone who is in wants to remain with their front row tickets to this worldwide spectacle we have going on in this very key juncture in world history. 
Would love to hear any comments or even if you disagree but I only ask that you make sense

One important part you forgot to mention. To sell gold, if you own the metal itself outright, you have to transport that with you to a gold buying place, hopefully you know someone that can won't be messing you over too much, but they will inevitably say, this gold you have here I just pass on to the smelter. I make no money, they pay me 95% (or 93% or whatever number they want to tell you is their 'deal' with the smelter) off the going price of gold. So they charge you 1 or 2 % of their own because they obviously are making no money otherwise, this aint a charity you know what I mean!
In reality the smelter pays closer to 98%. I found all of this out the hard way when in the end of 2017 I bought some gold, held it in my basement, and was very happy since it was a great feeling to know that if the whole place burned down, the gold would still be there. 
I sold it all and put it in bitcoin because there is no 'auto-repairman' gatekeeper dude who you have to trust is giving you the right deal. It is possible to shop it around and get the best deal possible, but in all honesty I was eyeing BTC since it was hovering in the 3.7K mark in late March and then saw it jump to 5k in like a day, and then a progressive climb. I'll take whatever hard pinch on the gold sale to just get out of it and get it into bitcoin. And Although I missed the beginning of this parabolic rise I am happy to be out of the 64K modem machine that gold is.
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:42:36
When it hit 20k and cratered down to 3k that was an 85% loss. If there ever was a time to test the 'will it go down to 0' hypothetical, it was then. And instead 3k was a much higher plane of settling if you remove the run up and crash part of the trajectory.
Pretty safe to say bitcoin won't ever go below 10k again. That is of course unless it goes down to 0.
@_date: 2019-06-18 16:45:01
As a relative newcomer to Bitcoin, I have recently poured in every bit of available non-essential cash into bitcoin. I have known about it for quite some time, especially when it hit those crazy highs in 2017 but always felt it unhinged, and I never checked out anything about the technology itself. I started paying close attention in about March this year when BTC was at about $3,700, learning more about it, and now I am feeling like there is no better place to hold value. 
I have a few thoughts regarding BTC that I have not heard expressed before anywhere and I wanted to share them to share and also see if it holds any water- 
Bitcoin's great potential at this juncture in time is very interesting because the last big financial crisis occurred in 2008, before bitcoin was around. Knowing how business cycles and stock markets work, we are due for a correction in the near future. My brother in law who works in Bank of America small business loans division told me 2 years ago the bank is treating the situation like its "the bottom of the 7th inning". According to that mindset, it seems like we are in extra innings right about now. Once that hits, BTC has a strong potential to blast up due to stock market flight. 
Second is that right now with the US political situation, with the absolute buffoon as president, the US Dollar and the US domination on the world's power stage has got to be receding, and quickly, but that doesn't reflect in daily life at all right now. With such a large entreprise as is the United States of America, we may already be, or heading towards, that peculiar situation depicted with the Road Runner and Wylie E Coyote where he begins to walk off the cliff, keeps taking steps and is as if on solid ground, until the Road Runner taps him on the shoulder, points down, he looks down to realize the situation, gasps, and begins to fall. As a Venezuelan, this is exactly what happened when the Bolivar went from 9.4 to 14 bolivares per dollar at the end of 2012, effectively crushing all foreign business interest in a two-week span and has been on a freefall ever since. The reason for it was due to the Dollars-at-a-discount policy where you could purchase up to $3,000 a year at the "preferential rate" of about 6 Bs/$ and everyone would just flip it instantly at 9.4Bs/ $ , effectively giving everybody in the country who requested it, free money. This didn't show its impact as it happened, but rather as one swift correction. Basically Wylie E Coyote. And the United States stock market is as hot as ever right now, with companies like Shopify posting 220% gains in 2019 alone and many others also crushing it this year, stuff is just not adding up how things are this hot so late in the cycle. Add to this the fact that the President himself is saying the country will enter the greatest recession ever if he's not re-elected, an inane comment but as we all know what he does best is hit you where it hurts most. In the back of our minds we should all know the party doesn't last forever. The reaction to such an event benefits bitcoin greatly. So we have an inept leader at the wheel, with China, Russia and basically everyone else in the world wanting the US to stop being the world's leader and father figure,  waging an electronic and covert war without escalating into fullblown conflict to position themselves as best as possible to take their opportunity whenever it presents itself, mainly, at the next financial crisis. 
The bitcoin halving event in about a year will also cause good upticks for bitcoin, and the SEC approving Bitcoin ETFs and further expanding the client pool to receive Bitcoin exposure will create further demand and price rise. This part of the equation is where I am least understanding of, because a halving event in and of itself doesn't affect the situation so hard, especially with as much bitcoin in the market as there already is, and from little research, not specifically tied to any significant increase in bitcoin price.
So these here are my 4 reasons why I decided to plow what I got into bitcoin and I am not sure I have seen all of these reasons presented together anywhere I have researched lately. But I do believe in the next 18 months or so bitcoin will at the very least break through its all time high of 20k and most likely a lot more, perhaps really a serious multiplier more, depending on the timing of these things playing out.  
I am toying with the idea of taking out money from my house by refi'ing in order to place that money into a 10 year hold of bitcoin. I would still keep at least 20% of the home value in case it all goes south but that still allows me a good chunk of cash. 
I would love to hear any feedback.
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:02:14
I tremendously appreciate your feedback and the link to that article is a good entry point into learning more about it. IT is also crazy to think that now at 9k per bitcoin it is still considered at the start of bitcoin, even when people were buying them at $100, $200, $600, etc, and feeling like it was overblown already at that point. But clearly over time and in accelerating fashion the value appreciates, with some extra fuel thrown in there whenever regular markets stumble and falter.
I would be very interested to read any other basic or more advanced topics like this if you have any to share
thank you again !
