Very sorry to hear that. First order of business is to protect what you do have.
You need to carefully prepare a new wallet, and transfer your coins there.
Do not use an online wallet generator.
Do not use a computer that has ever been connected to the network.
You need to do it one of the following ways:
* By hand
* On a freshly formatted computer that has not been online
* On a new hardware wallet that you got directly from the manufacturer

Even more important than a hardware wallet, for that much value, you really need a solid plan about backups and recovery in case the owner is incapacitated.
Tell them not to take it lightly. It is not easy to search 2^256 private keys.

TL;DR Unfortunately, no. The two coins won't be compatible.
Exactly like a stock, except when this split happens, an entirely new company is created, and the old one still exists as well. Also a new country, with new money. Some of the people in the old country will get passports to the new country, and some won't. Some will belong to both.
A new wallet will appear in your pocket or purse, with strange new bills but for some people, the new wallet will appear on the top of Mount Everest, and the won't be able to find it. There will be the same number of bills, but they won't be worth as much. If you accidentally use your old wallet to pay a laundrymat who only takes new money, the money disappears as you hand it to him, and he starts yelling at you.
Also, sometimes when you spend the new money, old money will spontaneously combust, depending on the time of day, and who you are paying. The two new currencies will have wildly varying exchange rates, and the members of the new country's central bank will change.
So, basically your every day stock split.

Here's an idea: get your parents to help you set up a savings account. My parents did this for me when I was quite young - about nine, I think. Research beforehand to make sure that the bank or credit union has online banking, et voila, you can sign up for coinbase.

No, I don't think so. The remaining work to make bitcoin viable for a large audience is vast. Some of it is technical, some of it business, some social, some legal. Bitcoin currently holds 50% of the market share of cryptocurrency. Merely doubling the market cap is far less than what bitcoin is going to do in the future.
Also, we don't have to solve every problem on our chain, with our code. In fact, it is more efficient for alternate coins to exist, when they are tackling different, and sometimes conflicting problems.

The price is going to go up again, based on people's ability to transact, media exposure, and other reasons for demand. It doesn't really matter why the 5K run-up happened, because the next sprint can be for an entirely different reason.
What matters long term is that the devs, the users, and the merchants are able to keep advancing, and using bitcoin.

First take a look [here]( It looks like Australia treats bitcoin like a currency, like most countries (the USA treats it as an asset).
Next, look up your country's tax laws for currency trading. It is likely you will not be taxed for the conversions (AUD -&gt; BTC, and later BTC -&gt; AUD).
But it is likely you will be charged taxes on the gain you made in AUD.

I saw that too. I'm guessing that many traders who had BTCC accounts had Bitfinex accounts, but not western accounts. So when I saw the Bitfinex volume, I figured it was BTCC traders leaving BTCC. Bitfinex prices are currently tracking western exchanges closer than usual.
But yes, if Bitfinex closed, there would be a temporary crash.
I believe it would take longer to shut down Bitfinex than the big three Chinese exchanges.

This currency is still in its infancy, and it has a few weird properties:
1. It is not accepted everywhere in its domain. But ...
2. Its domain is the Internet - the whole of net-connected humanity! That means that it has potential reach like no currency has had, ever.
That is future potential, not right now. Because of technical limitations, and because not everyone understands it yet, it is still very difficult to, for example, go down to the corner and buy a hotdog with it.
But the code changes we need (fast settlement), and the gadgets are coming rapidly. Way faster than even I thought they would. Think about how long it took to go from [this]( to whatever you have in your pocket right now. Bitcoin wallets are much simpler devices, and the point-of-sale device that the hotdog guy uses will become cheap very quickly, as well.
People who are HODLing for the moment probably believe two things:
1. Someday, you will be able to just go to the corner store and buy a hotdog
2. And when you do, it will only cost you a few Satoshis
So, for now, its just a fun, speculative investment that happens to be growing exponentially. But later ... to the moon! (In a hotdog cart)

Well, yes. But it is going to go up and down many many time after you get that account. Look at it this way. You have two things you need to do:
1. Find a way to get Bitcoin
2. (Decide when to) buy bitcoin
Don't worry about  before you have  figured out.

Fees on 401K withdrawals can be VERY high. If he has another form of savings, it would be better to do it from there.
It seems unlikely that the U.S. will ban bitcoin suddenly, because there are [ETFs trading it]( now.
If he has less appetite for risk, have him ask his 401K management company about it.

For your future knowledge, you should learn how to store your coins in a hardware or paper wallet.
This is an especially good time to learn, because there is no guarantee you'll have fast access to coins from both chains on most exchanges.
I recommend a hardware wallet first, because it is easier to use properly, and it's less likely to get lost.
If you live in the United States, I recommend CoinFort:

You are completely correct that a blockchain needs miners to survive. However, you have to remember how miners are paid:
* The base block reward
* Transaction fees
The first reward's value is influenced by the price that others are willing to pay for the newly minted coin.
The second's profit is determined by how many people want to trade on that chain.

Well, the reason is pretty simple. Assuming no other motivations, and an exchange with an ignorant userbase, it is much more profitable to only support one coin after the fork.
You can then sell the coin you don't support, for example, and have a TON of the other coin.
Free money from your users.

Charlie is talking about he bitcoin consensus. To put it more explicitly for others: If all nodes are running the same code (specifically, the code that decides whether to reject a block or not), then the longest chain is taken as the correct chain, and blocks are added to that chain.
However, there are factors that preempt chain length, even in the code (not even talking about social concerns), and one of the things that will override chain length decision is if the consensus rules (the rules that determine if a block is valid to that node) reject the block.

Yes, but you will have to carefully research how to spend it after the fork. A mistake could wipe out all the coins you try to send.
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:20:45
There is not a specific date, because the code is set to activate on a specific block number. But since bitcoin network blocks are mined very regularly, we can be pretty sure down to about the day. It's likely mid-november. The date will become more certain as time goes on.
What you should do is get your coins backed up onto a hard wallet (e.g. the Ledger Nano S), and wait for more information until after the fork. There's too much complexity to do anything except hold your coins offline, especially if you have a small amount of money in BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:06:30
Yes, a paper wallet will be safe.
After the fork, you'll have both coins, on two different chains. You'll then have to transfer each coin to an exchange that supports that chain, or load your wallet into a device that can use both chains.
But need to be careful how you make the transfer !! Look for instructions after the fork.
