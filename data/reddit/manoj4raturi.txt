Market psychology works under human psychology bitcoin and other crypto are not beyond and above it. Investors always jump into it as they are afraid of missing the boat. In my country people start buying gold when its price moves up and these are common people. Bitcoin boom was a result of investment done by new investors most of them had invested first time. Some of them are still holding it in the hope that they will get back the amount what they had invested.

Bitcoin is purely logical product based on Blockchain Technology. There is nothing to worry about its safety. Its blockchain based transactions are safe. Hardware wallet can be used to store it safely if you want to keep it with you for long time.

I want to own it for long time... but fluctuation is shocking...

You might be right but I have not understood why it happens whenever bitcoin price is up all others are also up and if it falls down others also follow, what are your views on it. Can you remind me when it happened that price of bitcoin did not have any impact on other cryptcurrencies and they observed major fluctuation regardless of bitcoin.
