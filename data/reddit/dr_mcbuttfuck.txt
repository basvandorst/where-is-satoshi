Do I need to wait for my qt wallet to finish downloading the blockchain before I can send my part of a bitcoin to my electrum wallet?
@_date: 2014-02-23 07:33:14
I'm joking! If I ever actually get some spending cash, I'll investing in more parts of a bitcoin. I do have 0.02398 bitcoin in my QT wallet but its been hours and the blockchain still hasn't finished downloading, which makes me want to use an exchange and use the exchange as my main wallet. I'll double my holding in the future, or whenever the qt finishes downloading the blockchain.

So bitcoin goes with linux style development cycles? Good to know.

Yes, a few percent a year of inflation is expected, but upwards of 10-20% increase in rent nominally is occurring in many areas. Increases are always more than 60% net profit.
@_date: 2013-04-19 22:48:34
But what about other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin has a lot of untapped features, but won't that only inspire something better? Early adopters of bitcoin already know how important it is to get in early. Why the fuck wouldn't they fund something bigger and better and that they could get in on first?!
*RapeCoin, the end of bitcoin as we know it.* Funded by the good ol United States gov't. Only, they didn't say they made it. They only have to make an obviously superior product, and we'll all flock to it.
Wouldn't you love closer to instant transfers, and a better fee structure? Maybe a cuter built-in GUI with idiot-proofing? Bitcoin can't compete as a micropayment processor if it ever peaks above a certain value, and so many features and concepts are difficult to comprehend for so many people.

I know what you're trying to do, and its just not going to happen. The increment is 1 entire bitcoin, or fractions/decimals of a bitcoin.

On the internet, a project originally funded by the State. On a home computer or smart phone, who's technologies were partially funded by **corporate welfare**. In a house, with a federally subsidized mortgage **so a bank is reassured their profit**. Which leads to a road which is paid for by taxes and tolls.

Investing in the stock market doesn't benefit joe sixpack, but investing in a new store in his shitty small town does. However, there is no profit in establishing a new store in that shitty small town, and we're both able to beat the indexes somehow too.
You can say that any form of investment trickles down somehow, but it just doesn't. Profitable investment does not usually benefit many people. Non-profit organizations and charities are a nonsequitor, as all the large ones are infinitely corrupt, such as "Pink" and "Feed the children" and "the salvation army." They run on exploitation.
So tell me, how does one rich man investing in another rich man's idea benefit the masses? How can the rich be convinced to invest without profit or a return on their principal? How do we get them to happily depart from their principal?

Alternatives are available, but they are tiered. You probably don't need a road if you have an airplane or helicopter. Don't need a house if you don't want one, don't need to get a job to help Apple research the iphone 6 or Microsoft to make their next console if your parents/close friends/lovers/ect are rich.
Are you poor? Please be happy that you have anything to utilize. If given the opportunity, richer people will dismantle the pleb tier services to benefit their own services. Shouldn't every man with a million dollars have his own airport or helipad? Slash food stamps and it could become real. Be glad you can vote because its the only reason you get to use anything at all.

We're not going to match visa any time soon, as far as transaction rates are going... As long as bitcoin keeps spiking, it'll be more like stock than cash. Fewer transactions.
I suspect 10TB+ harddrives will become the norm once we need visa-level capacity... And 100TB+ harddrives will be in the hands of computer nerds.

I heard about bitcoins way back in 2010 or 2011. I thought it sounded stupid because nobody would go through the effort to secure their wallets and, through user error, leave themselves open for attack.
I think I'm still correct, as we see people getting robbed daily of their entire balance. Keeping your money safe is still difficult and time consuming and well, patience is not a virtue of the majority of us bitcoin speculators.

How often did you two go bowling?
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:13:23
Hell no! POP GOD DAMN YOU! I WANT IN, *but not at $200 per coin.*
@_date: 2013-05-12 03:40:13
Yes. Builds character!

Maybe we need some nepotism? The big kids with ASIC hardware aren't going to get buried with all their ASIC hardware. They'll donate it to charities or their kids.

Thank you. Where can I find a small portion of a share? I can't afford an entire one, but I do have half a bitcoin to throw around.

But nobody is loaning out bitcoins. Interest on those loans are what pay the savings interest.

Why are the prices cheaper than on  ?

The gov't can't make them worthless, they can only become illegal... And you know how expensive illegal things are.

But what about everyone in line to get verified at mtgox? What about all of us that look at mtgox's line, **and** how badly the fucked up during the ddos attacks... 
Fuck mtgox, even paypal would be better.

If he sends me five, I'll probe *you,* and make an entertaining YouTube video out of the encounter. :)

Send them an email and ask.

I don't think that I'm going to be able to convince you otherwise until you want to be convinced, so, carry on.

I'll start my own Bitcoin foundation, with a black Gavin, and hookers.

Or squishing bitcoin. Whats the point of them adopting what they can never completely control? 
Theres no nozzle to print more BTC like USD when you want more liquidity on demand. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:50:27
Hey, some people like being told what to do.
You should let me take you out to dinner, and then we'll go back to my place. ;)

I'm happy at a stable $0.025 per transaction, but btc is getting more and more valuable, and the same 0.0005 fee is getting pricier and pricier.

What you described is legal, but you may have to suss out a contract and of course, get her signature. If you receive any income from your site, you will pay tax on it and she may also have to pay tax on her "reward."
Afterwards, you can say you're a job creator. 
@_date: 2013-03-08 19:24:46
But you do have to be attractive.

I want to say we need more slang for denominations of bitcoin... But I still haven't memorized that one yet. 
@_date: 2013-03-16 10:37:27
Whats more important is how many of the coins are in circulation. Wasn't it less than two years ago when only 10-20% of all coins were in circulation? And now we're well over 30%?
Thats fucking amazing. I'll shit myself when it goes over 50% circulation. The only true risk to bitcoins are a jackass cashing out his stash of 10% of all bitcoins in existence and dropping the price down to a dollar again. That'd be horrible for investors but not impossible.
And the fewer bitcoins out of circulation, the less risk. The more value bitcoins can realistically gain. I'm fucking excited.

If the infrastructure was already in place, then the likelihood of success would increase.
However, it is not yet there, and starting a charity-ish organization built around bitcoin sounds hard and unlikely to furnish me with free alcohol. But you have all of my support in words and upvotes, and PM me with your notes on the subject.

Leveraging bitcoin onto a single clinic in a tiny town, although great for the individuals getting care...
Is not changing the system. Changing the currency won't change the healthcare system.

Because miners are dicks and if you don't pay your five satoshis per transaction (which was above 10 cents per transaction at the last peak), your transaction will take many, many hours.
Maybe you don't think BTC will ever peak above the last peak... But I thought the same after the 30 something dollar peak. It will, with time. 
@_date: 2013-05-18 15:57:39
Yes, I'm sure you could get a blank-minded, minimum wage earning teenager to do that.
