I didn't read the actual patent application because I don't have the time to. But, assuming they're trying to patent bitcoin, why? It's impossible if it exists before. It's prior art. If it's challenged in court, it will be very very easy to prove it.

That's a major security problem. What if I accidentally tap my phone or I am simply standing close to the NFC receiver? Consciously opening the app can reduce fraud and unwanted payments. Also how hard is it to tap open the app for it to work? 


It's connected to the internet so it can receive the confirmation through the internet. Like I said, look how regular old magnetic strip cards work. 
EDIT:I have nothing against NFC. It's pretty cool. But what's wrong with using existing tech to the fullest?

They can be a payment processor (not so much about a broker) but as for the trading of BTC to USD, the sole person you exchange with is Coinbase. So it gives you less control of the prices. Other exchanges like BTC-e do give you more choices and resemble a stock exchange. But, Coinbase still lets you trade, with less options.

First off, most phone cameras auto focus. Secondly, you can have it such that the QR code generated on the POS system* has the payment amount and the merchant number, along with other required data for the purchase. When the phone app takes a picture of it using a payment app (not bitcoin for this example), that's signed in using your credentials, it sees the QR code and deducts the money from your account. 


I don't see why you have to communicate back to the NFC reader. Credit cards have been one way communication for decades. Don't believe me? When you buy something using your card online, you only need to GIVE your card number, name, expiration date and the security code. No writing to the card here. 
*A lot of the POS systems I have seen have pin pad devices that have full color high res screens that have the capability of making a QR code.

So what I dont know programming? I never said that I do. I put an idea on the table so that others will know about it. I dont need to know programming to have an idea. 


Well, you can have the same question of normal credit and debit cards today. How do you know if the software is copying your card number and info? Its just trust and having a secure software.


Debit and credit card companies deal with this day. In this example, i am thinking all disputes will be investigated thoroughly and if the person is lying, their account will be suspended for 3 weeks. That means no BTC in or out. It is harsh and goes against the whole idea of Bitcoin, but there needs to be some sort of punishment system. 


If this ever gets off and people start making code, it will just be open source software that anyone can use to make their own network. hopefully, these networks can talk to each other so that if you use card A on network B, the charge will still go through. However, I if I do get enough money, I do not see why not starting a service like this. 


Small shops that are independently owned for now.


Read the OP. I think I stated that before. If not, then initially you cant, but i envision sort of an ATM like machine that you can swipe your card and then it exchanges the BTC to Dollars via Mt. Gox rates. 


If I ever make this a real business, of course! Its not because that I have to, its because that I want people to trust the system. Also, I will never steal anyone's BTC. Remember though, this is hypothetical. 
I like your questions.

Your best bet is to have an ad-hoc mesh internet system where every node is a router. A node can be anything from a laptop to a computer and even a smartphone. I think you are thinking about that. Never localize anything on cellphones. Not everyone has them and not everyone has a smartphone. 
@_date: 2011-05-27 22:04:54
and no taxes
i am sure. the big thing that will make debit cards useful for bitcoins is if you want to go to a brick and mortar store and buy stuff. I made a reddit post about that. You cant bring youir laptop everywhere with you, so I thought why not put your BTC in a debit card account and use that card to buy things at stores with BTC. The debit card co will only work with BTC. [here](

Sounds good. I think another option is to use an Android app that does the same. Like Square, but it just needs a cellphone cam for the card's QR code. For extra security, an intermediary would be required (debit system?) so a customer can validate their card with a PIN.

one way to make people trustworthy and to make sure they will pay the loan back is to get some collateral. it can be anything, but it obviously has to be worth something to them, such as a car. It works with fiat money, and can work here. you need to loose some anonymity but, you can just as easily use another bitcoin address for paying money out if you want anonymity back (is this correct? i am not sure if it can work this way)

Relative to a bitcoin, it takes $8.735 to make 1 bitcoin. That means 1BTC is greater than $1. That is a high rate. I still do not get what you mean. Rates are rates. They are values. They can go up or down.

Hey people. I am currently in college and have plans for the summer. This means I might not have time to learn program and code the system (learning will take the most time because I have almost no clue how to. I only did basic HTML when I was 13). Feel free to make this yourself. But I do ask you to give credit where it's due (if applicable). Once again, I do encourage anyone to code this system: be it a simple (not really) android app or the server back end. Thanks. 
[this]( should help me out. 
EDIT: 


I just realized the app requires the backend and framework.

It is all based in contracts. You have to first call bitcoin as a commodity for now (because, i think it wont be legally held up in court yet) and then state the consequences. if both parties are 18 or older, and the contract is well written, and they both agree, I see no reason why it wouldn't work out. but, the only way for this to work is to have no anonymity, which, i dont see any problem. If a person's name is associated with a bitcoin address, then can't they just change it next time they pay out to someone or something else? As for credit and trust, maybe the system could look at people's credit history from fiat currency. I dont know how that would exactly work but it seems like it's workable. also, the person who is applying for the loan (not the lender) should give out some collateral just in case. 
@_date: 2011-06-09 02:30:25

Plus, if google integrates it with their wallet system (I wouldnt be surprised if they do, knowing Google) then it will be a lot better.

@_date: 2011-06-01 21:10:44
Well i am sorry I do not spend hours a day thinking of every single scenario. I dont have to. why? because i am not the one making it. its just an idea for now. you think i have to think of everything before i post it? its just a rough idea. and the whole point of making it QR and open source is so that it will be easier to adopt and use. if the merchant wants customer to trust that they are not secretly stealing their info, they can opt for using a smartphone with the bitcard (or whatever debit software is used) app. if not, a desktop computer with a special separate keypad can be used. the merchant can not touch the info because it gets encrypted right when it goes in the computer. or something like that. no one can tamper with it. the PIN number and the QR code image will be separate. the only thing the cam can see is the QR code. 
and for disputes, the whole reason for holding money is punishment. so what if no one else does this? people have to know not to lie about their system. people's funds will only be frozen if they are KNOWN to be lying and cheating, not suspected. i do not want to go into the details here. and the whole point of this is to let people exchange money in meatspace. BTC is born for the internet, but to expand its usage, it needs to be used outside in brick and mortar stores. and please do not mention anything about BitBills. ITs a wonderful idea, but the denominations are too big, and, its simply an entirely different idea. 
you are writing this paragraph as if the idea is made and you are complaining to me as if i am a debit card operator. relax. this isnt real yet. you can put your 2 cents in when its hosted on github. 
In the meantime, calm yourself. you will have every right to be mad when its being developed and no or little security is concerned with the system. Till then, its just an idea and relax.

Not everyone has the luxury of having a smartphone that can do that. Having a bitcoin app with all your money is not safe, unless you use two wallets: one for your phone and another one where the rest of your money is in. Using a card system is cheap, easy and anyone can carry a card around. and if you loose it? no problem. just call it in in time and there will be no charges. When every single person uses a phone as a charge card (like google wallet) then i would agree with you.

You got it wrong. Do you know how debit cards work? When a merchant scans the code on the card it pings the company to give the merchant the specified amount from your account with the debit co. Then, at the end of the month, all money gets transferred to the respective merchants. If someone gets your QR code, no prob, just as long as you report it in time.

I think we are getting to caught up in this "bad middleman" thing. You NEED a place for these services to aggregate the content. For example, for Uber, you need a centralized service where everyone uses to tell the drivers where to go and to tell you where to go. These middlemen also do some of the boring work so that we, as users, can focus on what we want, rather than administering what we want. Do you think every Uber driver, or Airbnb host has the time to build, manage and operate their own personal website? 
Middlemen are good and bad, and just as a disclaimer, I do agree that for money, middlemen are not needed. But the same just can't be applied to everything else.

Why is this in Russian when this Fedcoin is clearly in USD? 
@_date: 2011-05-27 03:06:35
and yes, BitCard is the middleman. If you can transfer money without you being at your computer using the bitcoin software, There would be no need for the debit system. I was thinking about this though. A while back before I knew bitcoin well, I thought the wallet can be stored on a USB stick. When you bring it to stores, you plug it in to the cash register and it verifies and deducts your wallet.dat file. Then I found out that it is not like that. Plus you are screwed if you loose that flash drive, of if someone steals it or copies it. Thats why, in these cases, a middleman is good because you can report a dispute that can be hopefully reversed if the payment to the merchant was not done yet.

Exactly. I said something like this in an earlier post. You just can't blanketly say ALL MIDDLEMEN ARE BAD because in some cases like this, they are needed. What's bad is how those middlemen operate. I think that's the issue. I mean, you can argue that OpenBazaar has a middleman, the third party who manages the bitcoins in escrow.

The main problem is that Mt. GOX isnt registered as a money transfer service. They are just enforcing that rule. So whats keeping Mt.Gox from applying for such license? 
This brings the question: Is anyone using bitcoin a money transfer service (person?) This rule applies to any currency. HOWEVER, if bitcoin is an e-metal (commodity), then its not subject to these rules.
